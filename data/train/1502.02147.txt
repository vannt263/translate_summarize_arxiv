    "the icecube collaboration s announcement of the discovery of a neutrino flux in excess of the atmospheric background is an inflection point in multimessenger astronomy @xcite . due to the steeply falling atmospheric background spectrum , events at the highest energies most likely have an extraterrestrial origin @xcite .",
    "neutrino emission from the jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite and cores @xcite has been predicted , but alternative possibilities are gamma - ray bursts @xcite and pevatrons in the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "all icecube events are consistent with an isotropic distribution , and therefore extragalactic sources are the prime candidates .",
    "only the predicted flux of @xmath3gev/@xmath4/s / sr at energies from 100tev to a few pev from agn jets matches the observed excess flux well @xcite .",
    "agn with jets that are observed at small angles to the line of sight are called ` blazars ' .",
    "their non - thermal emission becomes relativistically boosted .",
    "the low energy emission is generally attributed to synchrotron emission .",
    "emission at higher energies can be explained by hadronic and leptonic models . in hadronic models , protons ( as well as electrons )",
    "are accelerated in the jet .",
    "the protons interact with seed photons at lower energies ( e.g. , from the accretion disk or external radiation fields ) and produce pions ( pion photoproduction ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent pion decays produce neutrinos and @xmath1-rays .",
    "currently , the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of agn can be described equally well with hadronic and leptonic emission processes due to a large number of free parameters ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "unambiguous evidence of hadronic processes could be provided by an association of neutrino events with an individual blazar . in pion photoproduction ,",
    "the neutrino flux can be directly calculated from the observed flux of the high - energy bump in the sed @xmath5 .",
    "this estimate has been confirmed by monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the neutrino fluence can therefore be estimated directly from the integrated x - ray to @xmath1-ray flux of the broadband sed .    due to the large angular uncertainties",
    ", several possible candidate blazars can be identified for each of the icecube shower events .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that the 2 events at pev energies from the first two years of icecube ( ic20 , dubbed ` ernie ' and ic 14 , ` bert ' ) can be explained calorimetrically by the six candidate blazars from the tanami sample . here , we study the multiwavelength properties of agn from the tanami sample , as well as _ fermi_blazars that are positionally coincident with the neutrino events from three years icecube data .",
    "we address the question whether the sub - pev neutrino events can be explained by blazars in the error field .",
    "in particular , we calculate the expected neutrino fluence of the the four blazars in the field of icecube event 4 ( ic4 ) . icecube event number 4 has a lower median angular error of @xmath0 compared to the pev events with error radii of up to @xmath6 and a higher energy than most of the other ic events ( 165tev ) , i.e. , has a low probability of being of atmospheric origin . inside the ic4 error field , there are four @xmath1-ray bright agn listed in the 2lac catalog @xcite .",
    "we report on the multiwavelength properties of these four sources below .",

    "we compare the values of the egb flux to the total flux of resolved blazars , in order to estimate the contributions from unresolved blazars , assuming pion photoproduction . we find a total integrated flux for all four 2lac sources of @xmath18 , which corresponds to @xmath19ph / s/@xmath4/sr for a 7.1@xmath20 error field .",
    "the extragalactic background is @xmath21ph/@xmath22/s / sr @xcite , a factor of @xmath23 higher than the value for the resolved blazars .",
    "this suggest that a substantial fraction of the extragalactic neutrino flux in this field originates from faint , unresolved blazars , instead of the bright , low - redshift sources .",
    "assuming that the high - energy emission originates in pion photoproduction , the maximum expected number of electron neutrino events from all four 2lac sources for ic4 is @xmath24 for 998 days .",
    "this is close to the number of detected events , but given the different factors that might reduce the neutrino output below the rate predicted by our basic model ( leptonic contributions , neutrino spectra , etc . ; see @xcite ) it seems unlikely that any of the individual brightest blazars in the field of ic4 can explain the observed neutrino flux .",
    "this situation is similar to the fields of the two pev neutrinos ic14 and ic21 @xcite , where the predicted neutrino flux of the six brightest blazars matched the icecube observed flux , but the individual sources fell short of yielding sufficient fluence .",
    "the integral flux of bright individual blazars and faint remote sources , however , rises a factor of  2 above the observed flux in this field , consistent with the hypothesis that the population of blazars as a whole can explain the icecube results .",
