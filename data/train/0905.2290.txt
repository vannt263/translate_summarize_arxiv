    "@xmath0 single crystals undergo a first order metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition at @xmath2 with antiferromagnetic ordering of vanadium spins associated to a structural transition @xcite . in vanadium deficient samples ,",
    "the metallic phase was shown to be stabilized down to @xmath1 @xcite , where a spin density wave ( sdw ) condenses as indicated by a clear increase of the resistivity @xcite . at roughly the same temperature",
    ", the hall resistance shows a maximum , which was first attributed to skew scattering in an ordered magnetic state @xcite .",
    "stoichiometric @xmath0 behaves differently . when submitted to a high hydrostatic pressure @xmath3 , its longitudinal resistivity decreases monotonically with a decrease in temperature and any gap opening",
    "can be observed .",
    "this indicates a fully suppressed metal to insulator transition down to the lowest temperature without any trace of magnetic ordering @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the hall resistance still shows a maximum at @xmath1 @xcite , which may be explained by dominant spin fluctuations @xcite or strong electronic correlations @xcite in the low temperature range .",
    "it has been reported that the spin susceptibility of metallic @xmath0 under pressure exhibits also an anomaly at @xmath1 which has been associated with either low energy magnetic excitations or a kind of pseudo - gap formation @xcite .",
    "there is a need for complementary experiments to clarify the origin of this anomaly .",
    "when @xmath0 is epitaxially grown over a substrate , clamping of the film can prevent the structural transition @xcite . as a consequence , a metallic state which mimics the highly pressured state is observed .",
    "macroscopically , a distribution of strains in the thin film can lead to phase coexistence .",
    "the resistivity exhibits thermal hysteresis due to metastable states and is a non ergodic quantity in parts of the phase diagram , e.g. quantitative analysis of the measured values is ambiguous @xcite .",
    "however , using a microbridge as a local probe , it is possible to isolate a pure metallic state without any thermal hysteresis and no trace of the m - i transition . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the transport properties of a strained @xmath0 thin film in the so - called barely metallic side .",
    "we have performed conventional galvanomagnetic measurements and noise measurements .",
    "we will show that most of the properties are comparable to those observed in single crystals which were submitted to high pressure .",
    "the small size of the system makes the statistical averaging less effective and , thus makes extraction of informations from noise measurements possible .",
    "as we will discuss below , the analysis of conductivity fluctuations provide new insights into the low temperature ground state of metallic @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 thin film was grown on a substrate of ( 0001)-oriented saphire using the pulsed laser deposition from a @xmath4 target .",
    "the details of the growth conditions , and some structural and microstructural characterisation have been reported previously @xcite .",
    "in particular , the evolution of unit cell parameters was shown to be inconsistent with oxygen non stoichiometry @xcite .",
    "the film studied here is a 230 thick sample , with a low rms roughness of 0.47 nm ( averaged over 3@xmath53@xmath6 ) .",
    "it was patterned using uv photolitography and argon ion etching to form a bridge of length@xmath5width=@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "silver contact pads were connected using aluminum - silicon wires ( or copper wires for measurements at temperature below 2k ) which were attached by ultrasonic bonding for four probe and hall effect measurements .",
    "measurements for @xmath9 were performed in a he-3 cryostat .",
    "transport measurements were taken at temperatures between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a physical properties measurement system from quantum design ( ppms ) .",
    "all magnetotransport measurements have been performed with the magnetic field along the c - axis , i.e. perpendicular to the film . for noise measurements",
    ", we used a home - made sample holder and external electronics to acquire the resistance - time series and spectrum noise ( the acquisition part consists of home - assembled low noise preamplifiers , a spectrum analyzer sr-760 and a dynamic signal analyzer ni-4551 ) .",
    "the final resolution is dominated by the low noise current supply ( current noise : 0.2 @xmath12 ) which leads to an equivalent noise of 100 @xmath13 when the sample with @xmath14 0.5 @xmath15 is biased at low temperature .",
    "this is higher than both the equivalent johnson thermal noise and the preamplifier noise .",
    "the length dependence of the noise measured between different arms of the bridge allow to conclude that contact noise is not important here @xcite .",
    "fig.1 shows the resistivity of the metallic microbridge as function of the temperature .",
    "the resistivity is thermally reversible and ohmic for applied currents up to at least 1 ma and from @xmath16 down to @xmath10 .",
    "both the functional form of the resistivity and the absolute value were close to what is measured in crystals under high pressure @xcite .",
    "in particular , the resistivity tends to curve downward at high temperature but takes a value above the 3d ioffe - regel limit for metallic conductivity .",
    "this is often observed in so - called bad metals , and a large @xmath17 has been discussed as a possible consequence of interacting electrons @xcite . for a correlated metal ,",
    "a lot of different terms can play a role in electronic scattering , but at high temperature a major contribution from phonons can be still expected .",
    "the electron - phonon contribution to the resistivity is usually described by the bloch - gr@xmath18neisen formula :      where @xmath20 is the debye temperature and @xmath21 is a constant describing the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the high temperature data were adjusted to the phenomenological parallel resistor with a saturation resistivity acting as a shunt @xcite .",
    "a good fit is obtained for the temperature range @xmath23 .",
    "we found an approximative residual resistivity @xmath24 which will be refined below , a saturation resistivity @xmath25 , and a debye temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the deduced debye temperature was close to half the value of bulk samples ( @xmath27 ) , which could be qualitatively explained by a size effect @xcite and/or by stress in the film . for @xmath28 ,",
    "an additional contribution is needed to describe the resistivity . in particular , at the lowest temperatures , where the electron - phonon scattering was clearly negligible ( @xmath29 ) , a quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity",
    "was observed in the form of @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and a more precise value of the residual resistivity @xmath32(fig.2 ) .",
    "this fermi liquid - like dependence has been reported for single crystals of @xmath0 submitted to a high pressure @xcite , and , more recently , in strained thin films @xcite .",
    "this dependence is typical of electron - electron scattering @xcite which is the general interpretation in @xmath0 .",
    "spin fluctuations can also lead to a quadratic temperature dependence at low temperature @xcite .",
    "we note also that the functional form of @xmath33 over the full temperature range was not very different from what was expected taken in spin fluctuations theories @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 variation of the resistivity did not extend down to the lowest temperature , as can be seen in fig.2 . here",
    "an excess of resistivity was observed when @xmath35 .",
    "after carefully subtracting @xmath36 from the measured resistivity at low temperature ( @xmath37 ) , a logarithmic dependence of the resistivity was observed from @xmath38 down to @xmath10 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "this is the limiting temperature in our ppms cryostat .",
    "measurements in another film of the same thickness at the lowest temperature indicated that this logarithmic dependence extends down to @xmath39 .",
    "kondo effect ( scattering by magnetic impurities ) or weak localisation corrections can be made to explain that the scattering increases at low temperatures with such characteristics .",
    "the @xmath40 dependent conductivity which is characteristic of electron - electron scattering in a disordered medium has been proposed as an explanation for the low temperature upturn in pressurized @xmath0 resistivity @xcite .",
    "this however does not provide a satisfactory fit for our sample .",
    "in addition to the excess of resistivity , a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance ( mr ) appears for @xmath41 ( inset of fig.4 ) .",
    "its magnetic field dependence is quadratic from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and for all temperatures down to @xmath10 .",
    "the origin of the quadratic dependence of a negative magnetoresistance is uncertain @xcite .",
    "one possible mechanism is 2d weak localization ( wl ) as far as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the coherence length @xcite .",
    "quadratic negative magnetoresistance is also a common feature of kondo - like magnetic metals , where the magnetic field tends to suppress the spin fluctuations .",
    "remarkably , the absolute value of the mr shows a notable increase for @xmath38 , clearly evidenced by tracing the kohler s plot .",
    "the idea behind kohler s rule is that in conventional isotropic metals , the magnitude of mr is fixed by a single scattering time @xmath46 , and implies that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function dependent on the details of the electronic structure . due to its quite large generality",
    ", the kohler s rule is expected to apply in a fermi liquid also and has been used as a probe of non fermi liquid ground states . in the limit of the carrier density being temperature independent @xcite ,",
    "kohler s rule written in its simplest form is @xmath49 . in fig.4",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath50 plotted as function of @xmath51 for different temperatures gives a single curve , i.e. kohler s rule is fulfilled when @xmath52 .",
    "the strong increase of the mr below @xmath53 was thus associated with a departure from kohler s rule .",
    "the hall resistance also presented a maximum in the 10k-20k range ( fig.5 ) , as previously reported both for single crystals and for thin films @xcite . since it was observed in absence of a clear magnetic transition ,",
    "a dominant effect of spin - fluctuation has been proposed @xcite .",
    "such a maximum can also be expected from strong correlation effects @xcite . in summary of this part",
    ", we have confirmed that the magnetotransport properties of metallic @xmath0 thin film present similarities with @xmath0 crystals under pressure such as the @xmath34 variation of the resistivity and the maximum of the hall effect at @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the @xmath53 anomaly reflects also in the mr and in a kondo - like increase of the resistivity at low temperature .",
    "both electronic correlations and spin fluctuations can be used as qualitative explanations .",
    "benefiting from the small size of our sample , we have studied conductivity fluctuations by measuring the resistance noise .",
    "we have measured a set of resistance - time series at various temperatures .",
    "the temperature was allowed to stabilize during sample cooling before each measurement series . the power spectral density ( or noise spectrum )",
    "@xmath54 is then calculated .",
    "in ordinary metals , the electronic noise generally comes from the motion of atomic impurities or defects and the temperature dependence is dependent by the underlying mechanisms , e.g. thermal activation or eventually tunneling at low temperature . at high temperature @xmath55 ,",
    "we have observed resistance switches insensitive to magnetic field during long periods , which recall the hydrogen hopping noise common in several metals @xcite .",
    "the fractional change in resistance was between @xmath56 , which is large for individual hopping and implied a collective motion .",
    "note that this switching noise strongly evolved over a long period , as it was not observed one month after the first measurements , showing that the involved defects were mostly non - equilibrium defects left in the film after deposition .",
    "in addition , reproducible @xmath57 noise can be observed and this noise will be discussed now .    shown in fig.6 is typical noise spectra measured on our film .",
    "they are very close to @xmath57 over the whole temperature range .",
    "the temperature dependence of this normalized noise exhibits a non monotonic variation ( fig.7 ) , with a plateau in the range @xmath58 .",
    "the sudden decrease of the noise at @xmath1 is remarkable . to give an order of magnitude of the noise level",
    ", we use the phenomenological hooge parameter which is , for @xmath57 noise , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the carriers density and @xmath61 the ( probed ) sample volume @xcite . for homogeneous and pure metals , typical values are in the range @xmath62 . taking",
    "@xmath63 deduced from our hall effect measurements , we found @xmath64 at room temperature , which is large , but not unusually large for a metallic - like thin film and is consistent with a moderately higher concentration of defects in films than in bulk .",
    "noise in metals can be usually explained with duttah - dimon - horn ( ddh ) analysis , which assumes that the electronic fluctuations come from smeared kinetics of defects with a distribution of activation energies @xcite .",
    "when the defect relaxation is activated and typical energy is in the @xmath65 range , the noise generally increases with temperature . however , there is at least one report of a noise maximum at low temperature which however follows the ddh framework .",
    "it has been interpreted as evidence of low energy excitations in an oxide @xcite . in the ddh modeling",
    ", there is a direct relation between the noise spectral exponent @xmath66 and the temperature dependence of the noise in the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the attempt frequency .",
    "we have checked this relation and found that unrealistically large @xmath69 values are needed to approach the very small variation of @xmath70 . in parallel",
    ", the temperature of the noise maximum / plateau does not show any frequency dependence .",
    "actually , pure 1/f noise should follow @xmath71 in the ddh model , as we observed at high temperature ( fig.7 ) , and a maximum is not expected .",
    "we conclude that the low temperature noise maximum does not come from thermally activated excitations .",
    "it can neither be explained by temperature fluctuations which would lead to a too weak temperature dependence of the noise . in disordered metals at low temperature , universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) can in principle take place @xcite . in the ucf model",
    ", the noise grows at low temperature due to the enhancement of the effective coupling between disorder configurations and resistance changes .",
    "ucf can explain why @xmath72 rises when the temperature decreases , but not the apparent freezing of conductivity fluctuations for @xmath38 .",
    "since we observe a decrease of the resistance noise when a magnetic field is applied in the @xmath73 range ( a factor of 0.6 at b@xmath74 and at t@xmath75 , see the inset of fig.7 ) , a spin - coupling origin of this noise can be suggested .",
    "the blocking of magnetic fluctuations at low temperature with non arrhenius slowing down makes think of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "note , however , that some spin glasses do not show a decrease but a growing of noise at low temperature due to ucf coupling @xcite",
    ". to probe , directly , spins freezing with resistance noise , the sensitivity of the resistance to spins should be independent of the temperature and the coupling should be local @xcite .",
    "this appears to be the case with our sample .",
    "note that in some intermetallic compounds , similar properties , such as a quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity close to a peak in the hall coefficient have been interpreted as a spin glass type of freezing at low temperature @xcite .",
    "a precise determination of the magnetic disorder is required to better understand its role in the low temperature galvanomagnetic properties of @xmath0 .    to conclude",
    ", we have measured a large array of transport properties in a @xmath0 film in the barely metallic side .",
    "we found strong similarities with properties of single crystals submitted to a high pressure , and some new features such as a low temperature noise maximum coupled to anomalous magnetotransport properties . a central role of spin - configuration fluctuations , which freeze at low temperature , has been proposed .",
    "future experiments directly sensitive to magnetic order would be extremely complementary .",
    "noise experiments on single crystals , if feasible , would be , also , very interesting to compare with our measurements in films .",
