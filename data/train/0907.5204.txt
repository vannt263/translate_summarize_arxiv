    "close - in giant planets are thought to have formed at distances of several au and then migrated inward to their current locations @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the inward migration of exoplanets is still debated .",
    "some clues about the migration process may come from constraints on the stellar obliquity : the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis .",
    "the sky projection of this angle , @xmath3 , can be measured by observing and interpreting the anomalous doppler shift during the transit of a planet , known as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite",
    ". some of the proposed migration pathways would produce large misalignments ( at least occasionally ) while others would preserve the presumably close alignment that characterizes the initial condition of planet formation .",
    "for example , theories that invoke migration of the planet through interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk predict small spin - orbit angles , and that initial spin - orbit misalignments and eccentricities should be damped out @xcite . on the other hand , impulsive processes such as close encounters between planets @xcite or dynamical relaxation @xcite should drive systems out of alignment .",
    "the kozai mechanism also produces large orbital tilts ( wu & murray 2003 , fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ) .",
    "ultimately the hope is that the predictions of migration theories can be compared with an ensemble of measurements of @xmath3 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we add the transiting exoplanet wasp-14b to the growing collection of systems for which the projected spin - orbit angle has been measured .",
    "wasp-14 is a relatively bright ( @xmath4 ) f5v star which was discovered by the wide - angle search for planets ( superwasp ) to undergo periodic transits by a jovian planet every 2.2 days ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter j09 ) .",
    "the planet is among the most massive of the known transiting exoplanets , with @xmath5  , and it has a measurably eccentric orbit ( @xmath6 ) , which is unusual among the hot jupiters .",
    "j09 also reported a measurement of the spin - orbit angle , @xmath7 degrees , which is consistent with zero , but also allows for the possibility of a significant misalignment . in the following section",
    "we describe our spectroscopic and photometric observations of wasp-14 , made in an attempt to refine the measurement of @xmath3 . in ",
    "[ analysis ] we present evidence for a large spin - orbit misalignment based on our radial - velocity measurements obtained during transit .",
    "we summarize the results of our joint analysis of our photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in",
    "  [ discussion ] , and present tentative evidence of an emerging trend between spin - orbit misalignment , and the physical and orbital characteristics of close - in exoplanets .",
    "we observed the transit predicted by j09 to occur on 2009  june  17 using the high - dispersion spectrometer ( hds , * ? ? ? * ) on the subaru 8.2 m telescope atop mauna kea in hawaii .",
    "we obtained spectra of wasp-14 through an iodine cell using the i2b spectrometer setting and a 08 slit , providing a resolution of approximately @xmath8 .",
    "we started our observing sequence just after evening twilight , about 20  min before the predicted time of ingress .",
    "we continued our observations until 2.5  hr after egress when the star set below @xmath9 elevation . for most of our observations we used exposure times of 5  min , yielding a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 100120  pixel@xmath10 at 5500   , the central wavelength of the range with plentiful iodine absorption lines . at high airmass",
    "we increased our exposure times to 10  min .",
    "we also obtained 8 radial velocity measurements of the g2v star hd127334 on the same night , 2009  june  17 .",
    "hd127334 is a long - term target of the california planet search .",
    "keck / hires radial velocity measurements over the past 3 years show that the star is stable with an rms scatter of 2.5  .",
    "with hds we used exposure times ranging from 60 to 120 seconds , resulting in snr ranging from 110120  pixel@xmath10 at 5500   .",
    "we also obtained out - of - transit ( oot ) radial velocities of wasp-14 using the high - resolution ( hires ) spectrometer on the keck i telescope starting in july 2008 .",
    "we set up the hires spectrometer in the same manner that has been used consistently for the california planet search @xcite .",
    "specifically , we employed the red cross  disperser and used the i@xmath11 absorption cell to calibrate the instrumental response and the wavelength scale @xcite .",
    "the slit width was set by the @xmath12 b5 decker , and the typical exposure times ranged from 3 - 10  min , giving a resolution of about 60,000 and a snr of 140 - 250  pixel@xmath10 at 5500   .    for the spectra obtained at both telescopes , we performed the doppler analysis with the algorithm of @xcite , as updated over the years . a clear , pyrex cell containing iodine gas",
    "is placed in front of the spectrometer entrance slit .",
    "the dense forest of molecular lines imprinted on each stellar spectrum provides a measure of the wavelength scale at the time of the observation , as well as the shape of the instrumental response @xcite .",
    "the doppler shifts were measured with respect to a `` template '' spectrum based on a higher - resolution keck / hires observation from which the spectrometer instrumental response was removed , as far as possible , through deconvolution .",
    "we estimated the measurement error in the doppler shift derived from a given spectrum based on the weighted standard deviation of the mean among the solutions for individual 2    spectral segments .",
    "the typical measurement error was 1.0 - 1.7  for the keck data and 6  for the subaru data .",
    "the rv data are given in table  [ tab : vels ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : orbit ] .",

    "we used the orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ( optic ) , which is equipped with two lincoln labs ccid128 orthogonal transfer array ( ota ) detectors @xcite .",
    "each ota detector has 2048@xmath134096 pixels and a scale of 0135 pixel@xmath10 .",
    "ota devices can shift accumulated charge in two dimensions during an exposure .",
    "we took advantage of this charge - shifting capability to create large square - shaped point spread functions ( psfs ) that permit longer exposures before reaching saturation @xcite .",
    "we observed the transit of wasp-14 continuously for 5.5  hr spanning the transit .",
    "we observed through a custom bandpass filter centered at 850  nm with a 40  nm full - width at half - maximum .",
    "we shifted the accumulated charge every 50  ms to trace out a square - shaped region 25 pixels on a side .",
    "exposure times were 50  s , and were separated by a gap of 29  s to allow for readout and refreshing of the detectors .",
    "bias subtraction and flat - field calibrations were applied using custom idl procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the only suitable comparison star that fell within the optic field of view is a @xmath14 star @xmath15 arcminutes to the northeast .",
    "the fluxes from the target and the single comparison star were measured by summing the counts within a square aperture of 64 pixels on a side .",
    "most of the light , including the scattered - light halo , was encompassed by the aperture .",
    "we estimated the background from the outlier - rejected mean of the counts from four rectangular regions flanking each of the stars @xcite .",

    ".      figure  [ fig : transit ] shows our subaru / hds and keck / hires rv measurements made near transit , after subtracting the best - fitting keplerian orbital model .",
    "the rvs measured just after ingress are redshifted with respect to the keplerian orbital velocity .",
    "we interpret this `` anomalous '' redshift as being due to the blockage by the planet of the blueshifted limb of the rotating stellar surface .",
    "we therefore conclude that the planet s orbit is prograde .",
    "in addition , the anomalous redshift persists until about 1  hr after midtransit .",
    "this is evidence for a misalignment between the orbital axis and stellar rotation axis .",
    "were @xmath31 , the midpoint of the transit chord would be on the projection of the stellar rotation axis , and therefore the anomalous doppler shift would vanish at midtransit , in contradiction of the data .",
    "thus we can conclude that the orbit of wasp-14b is inclined with respect to the projected stellar spin axis . in the next section",
    "we make a quantitative assessment of @xmath3 .",
    "we simultaneously fitted a parametric model to our optic light curve and to the the 4 sets of rv data : subaru / hds and keck / hires ( this work ) , and ohp / sophie and not / fies ( j09 ) . to make our analysis of the rm effect largely independent of j09",
    ", we did not include the rvs gathered by j09 during transits .",
    "the photometric aspects of the model were given in ",
    "[ ephem ] .",
    "the rv model was the sum of the radial component of the keplerian orbital velocity , and the anomalous velocity due to the rossiter - mclaughlin effect . to compute the latter",
    ", we used the `` rm calibration '' procedure of winn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) : we simulated spectra exhibiting the rm effect at various orbital phases  k , [ fe / h]@xmath32 ;  @xmath33   * ? ? ?",

    "we found the results to be consistent with the formula @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the instantaneous fractional loss of light during the transit and @xmath37 is the radial velocity of the occulted portion of the stellar disk .",
    "the 18 model parameters can be divided into 3 groups .",
    "first are the parameters of the spectroscopic orbit : the period @xmath38 , the midtransit time @xmath16 , the radial - velocity semiamplitude @xmath39 , the eccentricity @xmath40 , the argument of pericenter @xmath41 , and velocity offsets for each of the 4 different groups of rv data .",
    "second are the photometric parameters : the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath42 , the orbital inclination @xmath20 , the scaled stellar radius @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the semimajor axis ) , the 2 limb - darkening coefficients , and the out - of - transit flux and differential extinction coefficient .",
    "third are the parameters relevant to the rm effect : the projected stellar rotation rate @xmath43 and the angle @xmath3 between the sky projections of the orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis [ for illustrations of the geometry , see ohta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , gaudi & winn ( 2007 ) , or fabrycky & winn ( 2009 ) ] .",
    "the fitting statistic was @xmath44 ^ 2 \\\\ & + & \\sum_{j=1}^{64 } \\left [ \\frac{v_j({\\mathrm{obs } } ) - v_j({\\mathrm{calc}})}{\\sigma_{v , j } } \\right]^2 \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\frac{p - 2.243770~{\\rm d}}{0.0000028~{\\rm d } } \\right]^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45(obs ) are the relative flux data from the optic light curve and @xmath46 is the out - of - transit rms . likewise",
    "@xmath47(obs ) and @xmath48 are the rv measurements and uncertainties .",
    "for @xmath48 we used the quadrature sum of the measurement error and a `` jitter '' term of 4.4  m  s@xmath10 , which was taken from the empirical calibration of wright  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the final term enforces the constraint on the orbital period based on the new ephemeris described in the previous section .    as before , we solved for the model parameters and uncertainties using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we used a chain length of @xmath49 steps and adjusted the perturbation size to yield an acceptance rate of @xmath5040% .",
    "the posterior probability distributions for each parameter were approximately gaussian , so we adopt the median as the `` best  fit '' value and the standard deviation as the 1-@xmath51 error . for the joint model fit the minimum @xmath52 is 291.4 with 295 degrees of freedom , giving @xmath53 .",
    "the contributions to the minimum @xmath52 from the flux data and the rv data were 246.1 and 45.3 , respectively .",
    "the relatively low value of the rv contribution compared to the number of rv data points ( 64 ) suggests that 4.4  m  s@xmath10 is an overestimate of the jitter for this star , and that consequently our parameter errors may be slightly overestimated , but to be conservative we give the results assuming a jitter of 4.4  m  s@xmath10 .    for the main parameter of interest , the projected spin - orbit angle , our analysis gives @xmath0    @xmath54  ( figure  [ fig : lambda ] ) .",
    "thus , the wasp-14 planetary system is prograde and misaligned , as anticipated in the qualitative discussion of   [ simple ] .",
    "our measurement of @xmath3 agrees with the value measured by j09 ( @xmath55 deg ) , but with improved precision that allows us to exclude @xmath56 with high confidence .",
    "we find the projected stellar rotational velocity to be @xmath57  @xmath58  .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than , but consistent with , the values determined by j09 from line broadening @xmath59  , from their rm analysis @xmath60  , and from our sme analysis @xmath61  .",
    "this agreement among the rotation rates provides a consistency check on our analysis .",
    "the best - fitting parameters and their uncertainties are listed in table  [ tab : pars ]    we found no evidence for another planet or star in the wasp-14 system . to derive quantitative constraints on the properties of any distant planets , we added a single new parameter @xmath62 to our model , representing a constant radial acceleration . a third body with mass @xmath63 , orbital distance @xmath64 and inclination @xmath65 would produce a typical radial accleration @xmath66 and our result is @xmath67  cm  s@xmath10  d  @xmath10 , or @xmath68",

    "we present new photometric and spectroscopic measurements of the wasp-14 transiting exoplanetary system . by combining a new transit light curve , several",
    "keck / hires rv measurements made outside of transit , and most importantly , subaru / hds rvs spanning a transit , we have measured and interpreted the rm effect . by modeling the rm anomaly we find that the projected stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit normal are misaligned , with @xmath0  @xmath54  .    of the 13 transiting systems with measured spin - orbit angles , only 3 have clear indications of spin - orbit misalignments .",
    "the other two cases besides wasp-14 are xo-3 ( hbrard et al .",
    "2008 , winn et al .",
    "2009 ) and hd  80606 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; winn et al .",
    "2009c in prep ) .",
    "it is striking that all 3 tilted systems involve planets several times more massive than jupiter that are on eccentric orbits , and that none of the systems with eccentricities consistent with circular or with masses smaller than 1  @xmath69 show evidence for misalignments ( figure  [ fig : rmdist ] ) .",
    "in addition to the three known super - jupiters with inclined orbits , there are also two eccentric , massive exoplanets with small projected spin - orbit angles : hd17156b @xcite and hd147506 @xcite . however , neither of these cases presents as strong an exception to the pattern as it may seem .",
    "the measurement of @xmath3 in both cases was hampered by the poor constraint on the transit impact parameter , which causes a strong degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath71 ( gaudi & winn  2007 ) .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the measured quantity @xmath3 is only the _ sky - projected _ spin - orbit angle , and that the true angle of one or both of those systems may have a stellar rotation axis that is inclined by a larger angle along our line of sight .",
    "it was already known that the orbits of massive planets are systematically different from the orbits of less massive planets .",
    "for example , @xcite , building on a previous finding by @xcite , showed that planets with minimum masses  @xmath72  typically have lower orbital eccentricities than those with minimum masses smaller than 1  . while sub - jovian - mass planets have eccentricities that peak near @xmath73 with a sharp decline toward @xmath74 , those with  @xmath75  have eccentricities that are uniformly distributed between @xmath73 and 0.55 .",
    "the tendency for misaligned orbits to be found among massive planets on eccentric orbits does not yet have a clear interpretation .",
    "it may seem natural for inclined orbits and eccentric orbits to go together , since both inclinations and eccentricities can be excited by few - body dynamical interactions , whether through the kozai effect , @xcite planet - planet scattering ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see , e.g. , ) , or scenarios combining both of these phenomena ( nagasawa et al .",
    "however , the mass dependence of these and other mechanisms for altering planetary orbits needs to be clarified before any comparisons can be made to the data .",
    "the misalignment of the wasp-14 planetary system , along with the previously discovered misaligned systems , have offered a tantalizing hint of an emerging trend among the orbital and physical properties of close - in , transiting exoplanets .",
    "however , trends seen in small data sets can often be misleading . to bring this picture into better focus , a more sophisticated analysis of the extant data , following",
    "the example of @xcite may be better . and as with all astrophysical trends , observations of a larger sample of objects will provide a much clearer picture than any statistical analysis of a smaller sample .",
    "thus , additional rm observations of transiting systems are warranted , with particular attention paid to trends with orbital eccentricity and planet mass .",
