    "angle dependent magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro ) are a valuable tool for the investigation of properties of layered metals such as organic and cuprate superconductors .",
    "the dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance on the direction of the magnetic field has been used to map out a three dimensional fermi surface sometimes in exquisite detail in a diverse range of layered metals .",
    "these include organic charge transfer salts,@xcite strontium ruthenates,@xcite semiconductor superlattices,@xcite monophosphate tungsten bronze,@xcite and an overdoped cuprate.@xcite more recent developments have extended this to allow one to not only determine the anisotropies in the fermi surface , but also of the anisotropy of scattering on the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite    in addition to the shape of the fermi surface , the coherence of interlayer transport in layered metals has been a complicated and controversial issue.@xcite in order for amro to be observable , only coherence between neighbouring layers is required , i.e. weakly incoherent transport , and for almost all angles , this leads to amro that are equivalent to fully coherent transport ( i.e. there is a three dimensional fermi surface ) perpendicular to the planes.@xcite in general the two situations can be distinguished in transport measurements only if there is a coherence peak in the resistivity for fields close to parallel to the layers . in this work ,",
    "we show that quantum interference effects can also lead to a peak in the resistivity at fields close to parallel to the layers , for weakly incoherent transport .",
    "however , this peak can be distinguished from the coherence peak by its magnetic field and temperature dependence , which is determined by the lengthscales and timescales over which quantum coherence is destroyed .",
    "the peak in the resistivity for parallel fields that we find arises from a contribution to interlayer conductivity in a magnetic field @xmath0 in layered metals which is a quantum correction to existing semi - classical transport formulae.@xcite there has been previous work in this direction,@xcite but this was either focused on weak localization in anisotropic metals , or did not consider the magnetic field configurations relevant for amro .",
    "our work is motivated by experiments in which deviations from conventional amro are seen.@xcite the particular deviations of interest are weak - localization like peaks at angles near @xmath1.@xcite we calculate the quantum contribution to the interlayer resistivity and show that it behaves in a similar way in a perpendicular magnetic field to the cooperon in a two dimensional electron system .",
    "we also show that a peak for parallel magnetic fields emerges naturally for reasonable choices of relevant materials properties , leading us to suggest that this physics is relevant for a number of recent experiments .",
    "our main results are an expression for the interlayer cooperon correction to interlayer conductivity , and asymptotic expressions for magnetic fields that are close to parallel to the conducting layers .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of a small peak in the resistivity for such fields , and discuss the characteristic behaviour with temperature and perpendicular magnetic field that allow this feature to be distinguished from coherence peaks at similar field orientations .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the consequences of our results for interpretation of amro experiments , in particular on the issue of coherent versus incoherent interlayer transport .",
    "in order to connect our calculations to the experimental data showing unusual peaks in amro , we first review the key physical quantities which determine the magnitude of weak localization effects in two - dimensional metals.@xcite the total conductivity of the system in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath2 can be written as @xmath3 where the first term is the semi - classical contribution and the second term is associated with quantum interference effects and weak localization .",
    "the relative magnitude of the two terms is of order @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermi wave vector and @xmath6 is the elastic mean free path , with @xmath7 the fermi velocity and @xmath8 the elastic scattering time .",
    "hence , quantum effects will be enhanced by increased disorder , which reduces @xmath9 . at low temperatures in zero magnetic field @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the inelastic scattering time , which includes all inelastic processes , e.g. electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering . since",
    "generally , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 some positive number , the resistivity diverges logarithmically with decreasing temperature .    the magnetic field scale ( the phase breaking field ) at which quantum interference effects are destroyed is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the diffusion constant .",
    "the area associated with one quantum of magnetic flux is related to the thouless length , @xmath16 .",
    "this magnetic field scale can be written in the form @xmath17 in order to emphasize the fact that this field scale is temperature dependent .",
    "destruction of the quantum interference effects by the magnetic field leads to a negative magnetoresistance which is quadratic in the magnetic field for small fields.@xcite when @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the change in the quantum contribution to the conductivity due to the magnetic field can be written in terms of @xmath21 , the digamma function , @xmath22 where the last equality only holds when @xmath23 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : weakloc_conv ] ) can be used to fit experimental data for the magnetoconductivity with one free parameter , @xmath24 , provided the diffusion constant is known . for thin metallic films and semiconductor heterostructures",
    "this has proven to be a powerful method for determining the absolute value and temperature dependence of the inelastic scattering rate.@xcite      our calculations establish the following : + 1 .",
    "when the temperature is low enough that the inelastic scattering rate is much less than the elastic scattering rate , i.e. @xmath19 , with no magnetic field perpendicular to the layers present , there will be a small increase in the interlayer resistivity which is approximately logarithmic in temperature .",
    "+ 2 . at low temperatures",
    "there will be a small negative magnetoresistance on the scale of perpendicular magnetic fields of order the field @xmath25 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ba ] ) ) .",
    "even when the field parallel to the layers is large there will still be a contribution to the resistance due to weak localization similar to that which occurs in zero field .",
    "as the field is tilted at an angle @xmath26 , slightly away from the layers , there is a small perpendicular field , @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , a graph of the interlayer resistance versus @xmath28 will then have a narrow peak at @xmath29 , which has a width proportional to @xmath30 when @xmath31 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath32 implies the width of the peak is also temperature dependent .",
    "the height of the peak relative to the background magnetoresistance will only depend weakly on the strength of the field parallel to the layers for fields larger than @xmath33 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bp ] ) ) .",
    "the resistance peak is quite distinct from the `` coherence '' peak which can occur at @xmath34 if there is coherent interlayer transport ( i.e. , a three - dimensional fermi surface).@xcite this coherence peak only exists at very high fields ( @xmath35 ) , has a width @xmath36 which is independent of temperature and field , and its height relative to the background scales with @xmath37 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite + 5 .",
    "there are two regimes of parallel field , separated by an intermediate field scale , @xmath38 for @xmath39 , the corrections to the conductivity are essentially independent of @xmath40 , whereas the semiclassical background does depend on @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 the correction to the conductivity has the same @xmath40 dependence as the semiclassical contribution , so that the relative resistivity correction ( i.e. the shape of the peak ) becomes a function of @xmath2 only near @xmath42      below we discuss several layered materials in which peaks in the angular dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance have been seen for parallel fields , and discuss whether the evidence points towards weak localization peaks or coherence peaks .",
    "one class of layered metals where weak localization - like peaks have been observed@xcite is the family @xmath43-(bedt - ttf)@xmath44am(c@xmath45o@xmath44)@xmath46y of organic charge transfer salts , where y is a solvent molecule , m = ga , cr , fe , and a = h@xmath46o@xmath47 . these materials have significant structural disorder , especially in the anion layers.@xcite this can been seen from the fact that the ratio of the resistivity at room temperature to that at low temperatures is of order one .",
    "in contrast , in many metallic organic charge transfer salts this ratio is as large as one thousand.@xcite    the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations yield an oscillation with period 330 t , corresponding to a circular fermi surface with wave vector @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding fermi surface area is an order of magnitude smaller than in many et materials .",
    "the small fermi surface area arises because the @xmath43 crystal structure leads to four bands , three of which are almost completely filled,@xcite so the fermi energy is near the band edge .",
    "the effective mass associated with these sdh oscillations is close to one free electron mass .",
    "the corresponding fermi energy is about 35 mev .",
    "the dingle temperatures , which are a rough measure of the disorder in the sample , estimated from the sdh oscillations are in the range 1 - 4 k , up to an order of magnitude larger than the cleanest organic charge transfer salts.@xcite    these materials have several features unlike other organic charge transfer salts that make them more likely to exhibit weak localization effects : ( a ) smaller fermi wavevector , ( b ) stronger disorder , ( both ( a ) and ( b ) reduce @xmath9 ) , and ( c ) the almost 3/4 filling will enhance the effect of the strong electronic correlations which narrow the electronic bands , reducing the fermi energy @xmath49.@xcite    in both the m = ga and cr ( y = c@xmath45h@xmath45cl@xmath45 ) materials in zero field the interlayer resistivity increases approximately logarithmically with temperature below about 20 k.@xcite the total change is about one per cent in the temperature range 1 - 20 k. at a temperature of 1.5 k , perpendicular fields of about 0.2 t and 2 t , destroy this feature in the m = ga and m = cr materials respectively . furthermore ,",
    "as the field is tilted towards the plane of the layers there is a small peak at @xmath29 in the interlayer resistance versus angle for both the m = cr and m = ga material .",
    "the width of this peak , for the m = cr material , @xmath50 ( in radians ) , has the field dependence @xmath51 , with @xmath52 t , between about 3 and 14 t.@xcite note that this is the same scale on which the weak localisation peak occurs for @xmath53 and small fields .",
    "the magnitude of the peak is about 0.3 per cent of the background magnetoresistance and depends weakly on the parallel field . as the temperature increases from 0.7 k to 3 k the peak becomes broader and smaller , and is not visible at 6 k , whereas the background magnetoresistance changes little in the same temperature range .      in @xmath54-[(et)@xmath55(bets)@xmath56@xmath45khg(scn)@xmath44 with @xmath57 ,",
    "the resistance versus temperature curve shows an upturn below about 5 k. @xcite about ten per cent of this growth can be suppressed with a magnetic field .",
    "the peak that occurs at @xmath29 is about 50 times broader than the coherence peak that occurs in clean @xmath54-(et)@xmath45khg(scn)@xmath44 samples at fields of order a few tesla.@xcite for low fields , up to 1.5 t , the shape of the peak depends only on @xmath2 , as we would expect for weak localization behaviour , and at higher fields , the peak becomes broader than at low fields .",
    "the high field behaviour that is not captured in our theory may be related to approximations we use that should break down at very large fields ( e.g. , 15 t in this case ) .",
    "in contrast , the coherence peak for @xmath54-(et)@xmath45khg(scn)@xmath44 has an absolute height that increases monotonically with increasing magnetic field.@xcite      the magnitude and temperature dependence of the inelastic scattering rate was recently determined in this material using amro.@xcite the data was fit to the form @xmath59 with @xmath60 3 ps and @xmath61 0.006 ps@xmath62k@xmath63 .",
    "this temperature dependence is also consistent with that of the dc resistivity in many organic charge transfer salts.@xcite the first term is associated with elastic scattering due to disorder .",
    "the quadratic temperature dependence can be associated with inelastic scattering due to electron - electron interactions in a fermi liquid .",
    "the ratio of the inelastic scattering time @xmath24 to the intralayer elastic scattering time is @xmath64 .",
    "thus , as the temperature increases from 1 k to 20 k the ratio decreases from 50 to 0.1 and @xmath65 will decrease from about 1 to 0.1 .",
    "we also suggest that weak localisation may be the origin of the feature near @xmath34 that singleton _",
    "et al_.@xcite assigned to the coherence peak .",
    "the peak width appears to broaden with increasing temperature ( as would be expected for decreasing @xmath11 , and hence increasing @xmath66 ) . in earlier data on the same material,@xcite",
    "the peak height drops with increasing temperature and the peak width increases with increasing temperature . for an inelastic scattering rate that increases with temperature",
    "this is to be expected for a weak localisation peak , since @xmath66 increases with increasing temperature and the width of the peak goes as @xmath67 , whilst its height should increase logarithmically with temperature .",
    "a peak near parallel field has also been seen in intercalated graphite materials which display unusual inverted amro.@xcite however , the width of the peak appears to be independent of magnetic field which would tend to argue against weak localization effects .",
    "in previous work , @xcite we considered the amro that arise when there is an anisotropic fermi surface and anisotropic scattering , in two different limits .",
    "these two limits were the limit of coherent interlayer transport and the limit of weakly incoherent inter - layer transport in which there is hopping between adjacent layers .",
    "we shall not consider anisotropy in the fermi surface , scattering or the interlayer hopping here , as these are additional complications beyond the physics that is our main interest .",
    "for isotropic weakly incoherent interlayer transport the hamiltonian describing interlayer charge transport is @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the interlayer hopping integral .",
    "we assume that we are in weakly incoherent regime such that @xmath70 there is no observable difference in the amro between the coherent and weakly incoherent models of interlayer transport except for polar angles of the magnetic field very close to 90@xmath71 , corresponding to a magnetic field parallel to the planes.@xcite the interlayer conductivity that is deduced from such a hopping hamiltonian is:@xcite    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the interlayer spacing , @xmath74 is the sample size , and @xmath75 is the retarded ( advanced ) green s function in layer @xmath76 .",
    "the angle brackets @xmath77 indicate an average over disorder .",
    "generically in calculating the disorder - averaged conductivity , there are two classes of diagrams to consider , the ladder diagrams that lead to the `` diffuson '' , and the maximally crossed diagrams that lead to the `` cooperon''.@xcite in our previous work , we found that the amro from weakly incoherent interlayer transport could be derived using a `` diffuson''-like equation.@xcite we expect that there should also be a contribution to the inter - layer conductivity from a `` cooperon '' like process , that will have a different magnetic field dependence to the `` diffuson '' term due to their differing time - reversal properties .",
    "it is this question that we address in this paper , and we find that indeed , an extra quantum correction to the interlayer conductivity is generated .",
    "moreover , it has distinct experimental signatures .",
    "we now discuss the properties of the probability distribution for impurities in a layered metal , and their consequences for impurity correlations .",
    "we assume that the probability distribution @xmath78 for the locations of impurities can be factorized into separate distributions describing the distributions parallel ( @xmath79 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath80 ) to the layers@xcite @xmath81 we assume that an individual impurity ( or lattice defect ) located at @xmath82 has a potential @xmath83 associated with it , and that @xmath84 correlations in the random potential take the form @xmath85 we shall assume that there is a uniform distribution of impurities in the planes parallel to the conducting layers , i.e. @xmath86 , where @xmath74 is the sample size .",
    "all structure in the impurity distribution is thus in @xmath87 which will tend to be peaked in the regions in between conducting layers .",
    "we note that periodicity and inversion symmetry imply that @xmath88 .",
    "we give a layer index to the random potential @xmath89 depending on whether the electron @xmath90 co - ordinate lies in layer 1 or layer 2 .",
    "there will then be two important types of disorder correlations @xmath91 where @xmath76 and @xmath92 are layer indicies .",
    "firstly , correlations within a single layer , @xmath93 , which contribute to the in - plane elastic scattering rate , and appear in the disorder - averaged single layer green s functions .",
    "secondly , correlations between layers @xmath94 , that are relevant for interlayer conductivity .",
    "the corresponding expressions are ( using the symmetry properties of @xmath87 ) :    @xmath95      in order to be clearer as to what we mean by an interlayer cooperon , we now discuss the nature of the disorder potential and the associated elastic scattering times .",
    "we shall assume that disorder correlations can be represented as delta correlated , i.e. , @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the two - dimensional density of states , not including spin degeneracy , and @xmath100 is the effective mass .",

    "@xmath101 is the scattering time for in - plane elastic scattering , whilst @xmath102 is the scattering time corresponding to scattering correlations between adjacent layers .",
    "if the impurities are all equidistant between the layers , i.e. , @xmath103 has a maximum at @xmath104 , then we will have @xmath105 , whereas if the impurities are located in the conducting layers , we expect @xmath106 .",
    "we note that previous theoretical treatments of amro have not considered the possible role of disorder correlations between neighbouring layers which could also modify the semi - classical interlayer conductivity.@xcite      the conductivity diagrams corresponding to the situation we consider are as shown in fig .",

    "some questions that we have not addressed here but provide interesting avenues for further exploration regard the effects of anisotropy and the coherence of interlayer transport .",
    "our calculation was for an isotropic fermi surface with isotropic elastic scattering  in general one can expect fermi surface properties to vary on different parts of the fermi surface , which would likely imply that the nature of the peak for parallel fields will also depend on the orientation of the magnetic field within the plane .",
    "this might allow the possibility of investigating the inelastic scattering on different parts of the fermi surface .",
    "secondly , our derivation assumed weakly incoherent interlayer transport .",
    "however , it appears likely to us that similar results should also hold for coherent interlayer transport , and so the presence or absence of this weak localization peak is not necessarily evidence for or against coherent interlayer transport .",
    "the visibility of the peak will be stronger in samples with relatively smaller values of @xmath205 , corresponding to smaller values of @xmath8 , but the criterion usually used to argue coherence of interlayer transport is comparing the hopping amplitude , @xmath69 , with the scattering rate @xmath206 .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the effect of the interlayer cooperon on amro in quasi - two dimensional layered metals . the interlayer cooperon can give rise to a peak in the magnetoresistance for fields parallel to the layers that behaves similarly to conventional weak localization .",
    "the features of the peak depend sensitively on magnetic field and the inelastic scattering time , which should allow it to be distinguished from coherence peaks seen in very low disorder layered metals .",
    "this potentially allows for the extraction of information about inelastic scattering in layered metals , and gives another tool with which to learn about the physics of these systems .",
