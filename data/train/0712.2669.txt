    "radio galaxies consist of twin jets of particles that are ejected from a compact active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , feeding into large - scale ` plumes ' or ` lobes ' .",
    "there are two distinct morphological classes of radio galaxies , low - power ( fanaroff - riley type i , hereafter fri ) sources and high - power ( frii ) sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "fri sources exhibit ` edge - darkened ' large - scale radio structure , with an initially bright radio jet that appears to flare into large plumes on kiloparsec scales . on the other hand ,",
    "frii sources appear ` edge - brightened ' , and in these cases relativistic jets propagate out to large distances ( often @xmath2100 kpc ) from the core before terminating in bright hotspots and accompanying radio lobes .",
    "observationally , the fanaroff - riley divide occurs at a 178-mhz radio power of @xmath3 w  hz@xmath4  sr@xmath4 .",
    "the fanaroff - riley classification of an object is influenced by the physics of the interaction between the kiloparsec - scale jets and the external medium through which they propagate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in fri sources",
    "there is evidence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the jets are in direct contact with the external medium , and entrainment of material causes the jets to decelerate from relativistic to sub - relativistic speeds over scales of 110 kpc .",
    "detailed radio and optical images of fri jets often show a ` knotty ' structure with many compact features ( @xcite ) that may be hydrodynamical in nature and related to internal shocks .",
    "there is also evidence that the fri jet in minkowski s object has been partially disrupted by a collision with an external cloud of gas ( @xcite ) . in the x - ray , _ chandra",
    "_ routinely detects x - ray synchrotron emission from fri jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , requiring _ in situ _ particle acceleration .",
    "jet  environment interactions in the more powerful frii - type radio galaxies play less of a role in gradual jet deceleration than in fri - type sources .",
    "the jets in frii sources remain relativistic , often out to scales of hundreds of kpc or more , until they decelerate abruptly ( i.e. , on scales that are much less than the length scale of the jet ) , giving rise to bright hotspots .",
    "many frii radio galaxies and quasars show knotty structure in their jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , there is little evidence to suggest that the knots are associated with major alterations to the propagation of the jets : the jets normally remain well - collimated and highly relativistic all the way to the compact hotspots .",
    "even when jet - environment interactions are thought to be present from other observations , there is seldom any evidence that these disrupt the jet .",
    "for example , the sources 3c285 ( @xcite ) and 3c34 ( @xcite ) both show a series of compact features along their collimated radio jets , while optical observations show regions of supposed jet - induced star formation . however , the large spatial offsets ( @xmath215  kpc ) between the optical star - forming regions and the radio knots are difficult to reconcile in jet  environment models .",
    "3c321 ( @xmath5=0.0961 , @xmath6=441 mpc ) is a prominent example of a frii radio source that not only shows evidence ( e.g. , @xcite ) for a radio knot , but _ also _ has a one - sided , diffuse ( i.e. , fri - like ) jet . on small scales ,",
    "a radio knot lies @xmath73.5@xmath8 ( @xmath76.2  kpc ) northwest of an unresolved core , and a seemingly bent and diffuse jet extends between @xmath713  kpc and @xmath730  kpc . on larger scales , two compact hotspots",
    "are detected @xmath7145@xmath8 ( @xmath7260  kpc ) from the nucleus at both radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the x - ray emission from the hotspots is most likely synchrotron in nature , which implies on - going particle acceleration in the form of a well - collimated energy input .",
    "optically , observations of the nuclear regions of 3c321 with _ hst _ ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) show two components , with the brighter , southeast member crossed by a kpc - scale dust lane , which itself shows a series of filaments .",
    "the absolute v - band magnitude of the southeast and northwest components is -22.3 and -21.2 , respectively ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "associate the compact radio nucleus with the southeast component .",
    "the northwest component is a companion galaxy , as is demonstrated by the common stellar envelope of the two sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the consistency to within 200 km  s@xmath4 of their redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , the optical emission - line spectra of the main galaxy and its companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that _ both _ may host agn .",
    "if confirmed in the x - ray , 3c321 would be a rare example of two merging galaxies , each of which hosts an active nucleus .",
    "to date , the best example in the literature of this situation is in the @xmath5=0.0244 system ngc 6240 ( @xcite )  clear evidence for the presence of agn here comes from the detection of fe k@xmath9 lines in both galaxies .",
    "there is a handful of other examples of possible binary agn , but in these cases the second galaxy tends to be significantly less luminous than its partner so that agn emission can not be unambiguously distinguished from starburst activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the compact knot and bright one - sided jet in 3c321 make it an excellent target for a detailed study of the role of environmental interactions in frii jets .",
    "we argue in this paper , based on new and archival data from merlin , the vla , _ spitzer _ , _ hst _ , and _",
    ", that the jet has undergone an interaction with the companion galaxy that lies immediately to the northwest of the host galaxy of 3c321 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a description of the data and a summary of their analysis . in section 3",
    ", we present the results of our observations of the nucleus , environment , jets , and hotspots of 3c321 . in section 4 ,",
    "we present evidence that the companion galaxy has temporarily disrupted the propagation of the jet , and in section 5 we describe the emission mechanisms involved in generating the complex emission in the north and south hotspots in the source .",
    "we end with our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we used archival vla observations ( table [ vlaobs ] ) to make images of the source at 1.5 and 4.8 ghz at various resolutions .",
    "our maps are of comparable quality to those produced by @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced in aips in the standard manner . in the case of the 4.8-ghz data , we cross - calibrated and merged datasets from the three vla configurations to produce a single dataset that sampled both the small- and large - scale structure of the radio galaxy .",
    "we observed 3c321 with merlin on 2005 june 20 in line mode at two frequencies , 1408 and 1658 mhz , over a period of @xmath10 hours .",
    "the merlin data were processed in the standard way and then imported into aips for self - calibration .",
    "after self - calibration and merging of the two merlin frequencies the dataset was then concatenated with the a - configuration vla data described in table [ vlaobs ] to provide short - baseline sensitivity .",
    "the resulting dataset has an effective frequency of @xmath11 ghz .",
    "3c321 was observed with the _ spitzer _ irac instrument on 2005 march 27 ( p.i .",
    "m. birkinshaw ) , with an aor duration of 1,072  s. the data used were the post - basic calibrated data ( pbcd ) files , which include a flux - calibrated mosaic ( ` maic ' ) file for each channel that is suitable for basic scientific analysis .",
    "we used three archival _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 observations of 3c321 .",
    "the first was taken on 1995 april 29 with the f702w filter ( 280  s exposure ) .",
    "the second was taken on 1995 august 12 with the fr533nr linear ramp filter tuned to 5487.7  ( corresponding to [ o  iii ] in the rest frame of 3c321 ) , with a 600  s exposure .",
    "finally , we used an stis nuv - mama observation taken on 2000 june 05 ( 1,440  s exposure ) .",
    "3c321 was observed with the _ chandra _ acis ccd camera on 2002 april 30 ( obsid 3138 ) .",
    "the observation was made in faint mode , with the source placed near the standard aimpoint of the s3 chip .",
    "we reprocessed the data using ciao v3.3.0.1 with the caldb 3.2.1 calibration database to create a new level-2 events file filtered for the asca grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 and with the 0.5@xmath8 pixel randomization removed . to check for periods of high background , we extracted lightcurves for the entire s3 chip , excluding point sources .",
    "inspection of the lightcurves showed minor flaring , and subsequent gti - filtering reduced the exposure time from 47,135 s to 46,932 s.      we compared the relative alignment of the datasets , and found that small astrometric corrections of order 1@xmath8 were needed .",
    "we used the unresolved radio core as a reference point , and compared it to a hard - band ( 47 kev ) _ chandra _ image .",
    "we found the radio nucleus is well - aligned with the southwest component of x - ray emission .",
    "the 90% uncertainty of the _ chandra _ x - ray absolute position has a radius of 0.6@xmath8 , so this gives us confidence that the radio and x - ray components are associated with one another .",

    "is also observed in figure  [ spitzer_hst_tidal_tail ] .",
    "the results presented in this paper demonstrate that the morphology of 3c321 is highly atypical for a standard frii radio galaxy .",
    "its one - sided , diffuse @xmath730  kpc jet is similar to an fri - type jet ; yet the hotspots observed on much larger ( @xmath7250  kpc ) scales are compact and exhibit on - going particle acceleration to x - ray energies . in this section",
    ", we explore the physical origin of these features , and argue that an interaction between the jet and the companion galaxy is the most likely explanation for its flared nature (  [ interp - evidence ] ) .",
    "we suggest that this interaction is a relatively recent one (  [ interp - timescales ] ) , given that _ in situ _ particle acceleration is still taking place in the hotspots .",
    "we provide some simple example models in  [ interp - models ] that demonstrate that a jet  companion interaction is physically feasible , and show that the situation of two merging galaxies , each of which hosts agn , is a rare one (  [ interp - pair ] ) .",
    "we also show that the observed emission from the hotspots and large - scale x - ray jet is consistent with that seen in other frii galaxies (  [ interp - hotspots ] ) .",
    "we begin by considering the physical origin(s ) of the jet knot at 6.2 kpc from the core and the subsequent flaring of the jet out to @xmath730 kpc .",
    "the diffuse jet morphologically at least resembles an fri - like structure .",
    "however , the magnetic field direction in 3c321 very broadly lies in the jet direction and so appears _ not _ to behave like fri jets . in standard ,",
    "twin - jetted fri sources [ `` weak - flavor jets '' in the nomenclature of @xcite and references therein ] the @xmath7kpc - scale magnetic field direction is usually transverse to the jet direction in the center , though sometimes a longitudinal field is observed towards the edge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "frii jets , wat jets ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , or limb - brightened fris [ all `` strong - flavor jets '' as described by laing et al . ] are those with a predominantly parallel magnetic field .    given the close spatial proximity of the jet knot to the companion galaxy , at least in projection , it is immediately tempting to suggest that the jet is being disrupted by an interaction between it and the companion .",
    "there is little velocity difference between the host galaxy of 3c321 and the companion , while the two - sided large - scale radio morphology and constraints on the beaming angle of the x - ray jet ( [ interp - hotspots ] ) are consistent with the idea that the jet is close to the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , the _ a priori _ probability that the jet will see some part of the companion galaxy mass / gas distribution is quite high . we emphasize that any interaction between the jet and the companion galaxy can not be entirely catastrophic : the jet continues to propagate after the interaction , albeit in a somewhat disrupted manner .",
    "if the jet termination were complete , the radio ` knot ' at the point of the interaction would essentially be a radio hotspot , in which all the bulk kinetic power of the jet would be dissipated , and we might expect a much higher radio luminosity ( the northwest hotspot is two orders of magnitude brighter ) together with associated ( radio lobe - like ) backflow .",
    "we caution that we can not rule out the fact that this apparent interaction is merely a projection effect , and that the observed flared morphology of the jet is instead an intrinsic property of the outflow . in the absence of detailed imaging of the radio jet to either side of the knot ,",
    "it is not possible completely to disprove that the change of jet direction is caused , for example , by a kelvin - helmholtz type instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a single jet bend is not possible , since the appearance of the jet should be that of a projected helix in the kelvin - helmholtz framework : in other words , some distance back from the bend there would have to be a bend in the opposite sense .",
    "this problem could be overcome if the growth length of the instability is short , so that the previous bend could be quite small , but then suppressing the other modes of k - h instability would be difficult .",
    "we also can not rule out the possibility that the jet is intrinsically broad to begin with ; i.e. , that the ` knot ' is in fact an edge - brightened feature of a lower surface brightness structure that extends further north .",
    "however , given that the compact components seen in the northwest hotspot are substantially smaller than the diffuse jet at its widest point ( 2.3@xmath8=4.1  kpc ) , it is difficult to see how the jet could terminate in such compact features if the hotspots are the beamheads of active jets .",
    "although these problems are not insurmountable , we consider the _",
    "simplest _ interpretation to be that the jet interacts with the companion galaxy , and we explore the consequences of this explanation in the following subsections .",
    "the northwest hotspot has compact components in the radio and emits x - ray synchrotron radiation ( @xcite ) that is indicative of on - going particle acceleration .",
    "energy is therefore required to sustain the hotspots in x - rays , and interpreting the hotspots as the beamheads of active jets is a logical way to maintain the energy .",
    "this suggests that the jet  companion interaction is _ not _ a steady - state situation .",
    "we argue that ( 1 ) the jet has been disrupted on a timescale less than the jet travel time to the end of the lobe  probably comparable to the light travel time of @xmath1 years , assuming that the source is close to the plane of the sky , and that ( 2 ) the jet flow to the northwest hotspot will only be disrupted for as long as the jet ",
    "companion interaction takes place . from fitting to the merlin data",
    ", we estimate that the width of the jet close to the bright knot is @xmath70.4 kpc , and we assume that this represents the width of the energy - carrying channel . if the companion galaxy is moving at a speed of @xmath47 km  s@xmath4 , which is plausible given the range of radial velocities observed in the optical line emission ( @xcite ) , then the time taken for gas associated with the companion to intercept the entire width of the jet is @xmath48 years . if the interaction has lasted for less than @xmath49 years , then the projected length of the disrupted jet ( @xmath730  kpc ) implies that the speed of the jet downstream of the interaction is @xmath50 .",
    "this is not implausible given that we expect the pre - shock bulk speed of the jet to have been relativistic .",
    "we presented evidence that an interaction between the jet and the companion galaxy is qualitatively the most simple explanation for the observed broadening in the jet , and that the interaction is not a catastrophic one for the continued propagation of the jet . here",
    "we discuss two simple models that demonstrate that the model of a jet  environment interaction is at least physically plausible , but we do not aim to distinguish between them .",
    "one possible model is that the jet is gently disrupted by an interaction with the gaseous ism of the companion galaxy . for jets with similar powers to 3c321 , interactions with a diffuse medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) , plausibly of lower density than gas associated with the companion galaxy in 3c321 , are seen to be capable of producing sharp bends ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of 3c321 , the jet is observed to bend at most several tens of degrees , and so this type of interaction seems plausible .",
    "another model is that the jet has encountered a clump of dense cold material which causes an internal shock in the jet and creates a deflection in the outflow .",
    "the flat spectral index ( @xmath9@xmath70.55 ) of the knot between 1.5 and 4.8 ghz is not inconsistent with some particle acceleration having taken place .",
    "for example , @xmath9=1 would be difficult to reconcile with a model in which the knot is a physical manifestation of a strong interaction of the jet with its environment .",
    "@xcite performed relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of such an interaction , and found that a knot of synchrotron emission is observed at the interaction point , similar to the situation in 3c321 .",
    "they found that the jet can deflect through a significant angle in direct response to its interaction with the cloud but remain stable afterward , depending on the density contrast of the cloud to the ambient medium . in 3c321",
    ", the observations can be explained if the shock in the jet also translates bulk kinetic energy into internal energy of the jet , causing the jet to expand downstream of the shock , and giving rise to the region immediately downstream of the knot with little or no detected radio emission .",
    "the jet would then recollimate and brighten , perhaps at a reconfinement shock , creating the bright diffuse radio emission we see at 13 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "for consistency with this description , we require that the external obstacle should not have been accelerated to relativistic speeds by the thrust of the jet over the timescale of the interaction : that is , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the pressure of the jet , and cross - sectional area and mass of the obstacle , respectively . even in the limiting case that all the thrust of the jet acts to accelerate the obstacle over @xmath55 years , though , this only requires @xmath56 , in the mass range for giant molecular clouds in our own galaxy .",
    "there is at present no observational way of constraining these models .",
    "the existing _ chandra _ observations can only provide very approximate constraints on the density of hot gas in the region of the companion , while dense clumps of cold gas are not detectable by any available observation .",
    "in addition , the kinetic power of the jet is extremely uncertain .",
    "our object in presenting these models is simply to show that such jet - environment interactions are physically possible .",
    "detailed hydrodynamical simulations with the aim of reproducing the observed radio structure of the jet might enable us to make some progress in this area .      the extended gas envelope seen in the _ hst _ , _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ observations ( section  [ diffuse_and_tails ] ) suggests that we are seeing a merger between the host galaxy of 3c321 and the smaller ( companion ) galaxy , and that the companion galaxy is orbiting the center of mass in the clockwise direction .",
    "the temperature of the south x - ray gas ` tail ' is @xmath57  kev , which suggests that it was previously associated with the galaxy - scale atmosphere of either the host or companion galaxy .",
    "our detection of heavily absorbed nuclear x - ray emission in the companion galaxy of 3c321 (  [ spectra - xray ] ) , together with its optical emission - line spectrum ( @xcite ) , circumnuclear optical polarization ( @xcite ) , and broad h@xmath9 wings ( @xcite ) confirm that the companion galaxy is an agn in its own right .",
    "no radio emission is associated with the nucleus of the companion galaxy , leading to its classification as a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "the situation of two merging galaxies , each of which host agn , is a rare one , at least for low redshift systems for which good - quality x - ray data exist .",
    "the best - studied example of a binary agn is in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ngc6240 ( @xcite ) , which shows neutral fe  k@xmath9 line emission in both nuclei .",
    "there is a handful of other examples of possible binary agn , but in these cases the second galaxy tends to be significantly less luminous than its partner so that agn emission can not be unambiguously distinguished from starburst activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in 3c321",
    "we see evidence for two heavily obscured agn , each with luminosities in excess of @xmath58 ergs  @xmath4 , _ and _ an frii jet - gas interaction .",
    "as these are unusual , it is worth considering whether there can be any _ causal _ link between the two .",
    "one highly speculative possibility is that an interaction with the radio galaxy jet helped to drive material onto the nucleus of the companion , triggering its currently observed agn activity .",
    "however , as the nucleus is currently 0.85 kpc to the north of the peak of the jet , any such interaction must have taken place @xmath59 myr ago for a nominal galaxy speed of 200 km  s@xmath4 : thus , by the arguments used above , it can not have been the same as the interaction that is currently taking place , since otherwise no compact hotspots would be seen . in this picture",
    "we would require two interactions with a re - establishment of the well - collimated jet flow in between , so even here we have to be ` lucky ' to see both an agn in the companion and an interaction between the jet and companion - associated gas .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the merger triggered both agn _ independently _ , in which case several of these problems would be removed .",
    "3c321 , like many other frii radio sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) has morphologically different northern and southern hotspots , each of which consist of multiple compact radio components , together with spatial offsets between the radio and x - ray emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is conventional to describe hotspot features in terms of a compact ` primary ' hotspot , which marks the point of termination of the jet , together with one or more diffuse ` secondary ' features , which may or may not be connected to the primary by some sort of collimated outflow .",
    "we follow this convention below .    in the northern hotspot of 3c321 , a relatively compact ` primary ' ( n2 )",
    "is observed in the radio , and is accompanied by x - ray emission ( nx3 and nx4 ) either side of it .",
    "a possible explanation for the x - ray and radio morphology of the northern hotspot is that the jet has entered it through the ` tail - like ' radio structure just south of n1 ( in which case the feature nx1 would represent x - ray emission from the jet ) before terminating at n2 .",
    "the physical reason why x - ray - emitting features could lie either side of a primary radio hotspot remains unclear , although this morphology is similar to that observed in the northern hotspot of the nearby , well - studied radio galaxy 3c  390.3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the southern hotspot is morphologically rather different from the northern hotspot .",
    "the spatial offset of @xmath60@xmath8 ( 2.7  kpc ) between s1 and the main component of x - ray emission ( sx1 ) can be accounted for in several ways .",
    "for example , sx1 may _ not _ be directly related to the radio hotspot , and could for instance be synchrotron emission from i ) a ( deviated ) jet as it enters the southern hotspot , or ii ) the radio tail observed just north of s1 , which could be some sort of outflow associated with s1 .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray emission may be directly related to the compact radio hotspot , but offset from it , and may either trace the location of the shock _ now _ , or be produced by inverse - compton scattering of radio synchrotron - emitting photons in the slower ( downstream ) component of the flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations of 3c321 are qualitatively consistent with any of these interpretations , and so we can not distinguish between them .    in the x - ray ,",
    "the most frequently discussed emission mechanisms for hotspots are synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation .",
    "@xcite argued that in low - power hotspots like those of 3c321 the ssc process is unlikely to be important , and showed specifically for 3c321 that ssc with equipartition field strengths underpredicts the level of x - ray emission observed by several orders of magnitude .",
    "if the hotspot x - ray emission is synchrotron , then it implies that there is ongoing high - energy particle acceleration , and therefore ongoing well - collimated energy input , in both hotspots .",
    "we see clear evidence for x - ray emission from the southern jet of 3c321 over @xmath750 kpc .",
    "jet x - ray emission has been seen in a number of other low - power , low - redshift frii radio galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and in those cases it seems almost certain that the emission mechanism is synchrotron . in the case of 3c321",
    "we find ( using the code of @xcite ) that the equipartition prediction for ssc is more than 4 orders of magnitude below the observed x - ray , while beamed inverse - compton scattering of the cmb requires angles to the line of sight of @xmath61 and bulk lorentz factors @xmath62 . the synchrotron process thus seems to be the only viable mechanism to explain the detected jet x - ray emission in 3c321 . if this is the case it requires a distributed particle acceleration process throughout the observed x - ray and radio jet .",
    "the existing optical and infrared data do not provide interesting constraints on a synchrotron model .",
    "we have presented results from a radio through x - ray study of the nucleus , environment , jets , and hotspots , of the nearby frii radio galaxy 3c321 .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the inner radio morphology of the source is atypical for an frii radio source .",
    "a small - scale jet emerges from the nucleus of its host galaxy , produces a knot of radio emission that lies immediately to the south ( in projection ) of a smaller companion galaxy , and then flares and bends into a diffuse structure 35  kpc from the nucleus .",
    "we argue that the simplest explanation for the morphology of the small - scale diffuse radio jet is that it is interacting with the companion galaxy .",
    "we have discussed two representative models , including an interaction with the ism of the companion galaxy and a cloud of dense gas , that can account for the morphology , although we are unable to distinguish between them .",
    "3 .   the northwest hotspot that lies @xmath0250  kpc from the core exhibits on - going _ in situ _ particle acceleration to x - ray energies , which strongly suggests that the disruption of the jet is not a steady - state situation . in other words",
    ", we argue that the jet has been disrupted on a timescale less than the light travel time to the northwest hotspot of @xmath49 years , and that the jet flow to this hotspot will only be affected for as long as the interaction takes place .",
    "4 .   we can not rule out the situation that the diffuse morphology of the radio jet is somehow related to an intrinsic property of the jet , rather than the extrinsic impact of the environment through which it propagates .",
    "however , these alternative models would need additional physics to explain , for example , why the diffuse jet appears to be one - sided .",
    "5 .   the host galaxy of 3c321 and the companion galaxy are in the process of merging , and",
    "each hosts a luminous agn .",
    "as this is an unusual situation , we have investigated the hypotheses that the interacting jet has driven material on to the companion galaxy , triggering its agn , or that the merger has triggered the agn activity in both galaxies .",
    "there are multiple sites of x - ray emission in both the northern and southern hotspots , together with spatial offsets between the radio and x - ray emission .",
    "we have presented several models that might account for the radio  x - ray offsets , including a sudden bending of the jet as it enters the hotspot , x - ray emission associated with an outflow from the primary hotspot , and differences in the electron - energy distributions and particle - acceleration processes in the hotspot .",
