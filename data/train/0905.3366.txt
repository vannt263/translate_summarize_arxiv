    "the operator @xmath11 can be seen to contain one or more terms that individually annihilate the matsubara integral @xmath116 , so that actually the operator @xmath11 can be made `` smaller '' . to state this result",
    "we need the following graph - theoretical definition @xcite :    a _ cutset _ of the ( connected ) graph @xmath0 is a set of lines whose removal from the graph results in a disconnected graph .",

    "however , as we shall see , it is possible to regulate the sum in in such a way that it is well defined .",
    "the main results that will allow us to obtain a complete evaluation of the matsubara sum @xmath12 were obtained by m.  gaudin @xcite long ago , and will be reviewed in this section , adapted to the context of this paper .",
    "gaudin showed that the summand in admits a decomposition into partial fractions , which allows us to systematically eliminate the constrains imposed by the delta function @xmath73 and perform the sum explicitly .    the generalized kronecker delta @xmath73 enforces @xmath131 independent linear relations satisfied by the summation variables @xmath10 , also involving the vertex parameters @xmath6 , which we shall write as @xmath132    this system of linear equations allows us to solve for @xmath133 of the @xmath2 summation variables in terms of a set of @xmath134 independent ones . in general",
    ", there will be several distinct ways of choosing this set of independent summation variables . as shown by gaudin@xcite",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between the collection of all possible sets of independent summation variables and the set of all _ trees _ associated to the given ( connected ) graph @xmath0 .",
    "a tree is a set of lines of @xmath0 joining all vertices and making a connected graph with no cycles .",
    "every tree @xmath135 will contain @xmath131 lines and its complement @xmath136 ( the set of lines of @xmath0 which do not belong to @xmath135 ) will have @xmath126 lines .",
    "the summation variables corresponding to the @xmath126 lines in @xmath136 , denoted by @xmath137 , will constitute a set of independent summation variables in terms of which the system can be solved .",
    "the summation variables associated with the lines of the tree , @xmath138 , with @xmath139 , will be linear combinations of the independent summation variables and the vertex parameters , @xmath140    as a simple example , in figure [ fig - g3trees ] we show the three possible trees for the @xmath86-graph @xmath87 . in this case , each tree @xmath135 is composed by a single line ( heavy line ) , whose summation variable can be expressed , after solving for the constraint at one of the vertices imposed by the delta function , in terms of the two independent summation variables associated with the ( thin ) lines that do not belong to the tree ( these are the lines in @xmath136 ) and the vertex parameter @xmath63 .",
    "for instance , for the first tree we have @xmath141 , etc .    similarly , for the @xmath103-graph @xmath102 of figure [ fig - g4 ] there exist 8 trees , shown in figure [ fig - g4trees ] .",
    "the system of equations determined by the kronecker deltas in the definition of @xmath107 can be solved in terms of 8 different sets of independent variables , one for each of the 8 trees .",
    "for instance , the solution that led to the double sum , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , corresponds to the last tree in figure [ fig - g4trees ] ( the one in the bottom - right corner ) .",
    "gaudin s main insight is the following identity for the rational function appearing in : @xmath145    for instance , for the case of the matsubara sum @xmath93 this identity takes the form @xmath146 we note that the identity holds only in the presence of the constraint @xmath73 on the variables @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , in the example above , @xmath147 so that the identity holds only if the constraint @xmath148 is imposed .",
    "once we have applied gaudin s identity to the matsubara sum , we proceed to perform the sum over the variables @xmath10 .",

    "the basic idea is to associate to each line @xmath77 in the graph @xmath0 a real parameter @xmath152 , which at the end will be taken to zero , and consider the sum @xmath153 so that @xmath154 the subtle issues related to the interchange in the order of limits and summations are discussed at length in @xcite .",
