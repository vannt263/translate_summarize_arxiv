    "since the early suggestion @xcite a variety of coherent two - photon processes have attracted much interest , both from theoretical @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and experimental sides @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . our present work is focused on a different aspect of coherent two photon emission from @xmath5type three level atoms ( or molecules ) where transition between two lower levels is dipole - forbidden ( see fig([lambda - type atom ] ) for the level structure ) . as pointed out in @xcite , a macroscopic target made of metastable atoms in the @xmath6 of fig([lambda - type atom ] ) may induce a characteristic event of macro - coherent two photon emission , two photons exactly back to back emitted with equal energies .",
    "we use for this phenomenon the terminology of two - photon paired superradiance , or psr in short .",
    "the term paired is used because two emitted photons are highly correlated in their momenta and spin orientations ( most clearly seen in @xmath7 transition ) . the rate enhancement factor in the momentum configuration of the back to back emission",
    "is expected much larger than in the usual superradiance ( sr ) case @xcite due to lack of the wavelength limitation there : the coherent volume for sr is limited with the wavelength @xmath8 by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the target length for a cylindrical configuration , while the macro - coherent psr has the coherent volume of entire cylinder irradiated by trigger .",
    "the usual single photon superradiance occurs irrespective of absence or presence of trigger due to the intrinsic instability of exponential spontaneous decay caused by dipole - allowed transition . on the other hand ,",
    "two - photon emission occurs with a much smaller rate in higher order of perturbation beyond dipole - forbidden transition , hence the use of trigger is essential to assist the macro - coherence development for two - photon process and induce rapid psr events of large signal . quantum initiation such as proposed for sr in @xcite is not needed , since psr is more akin to the triggered sr @xcite , which makes appropriate the following semi - classical treatment .",
    "a basic formalism of two - photon process already exists , @xcite for propagation equation and @xcite for analytic results of the propagation problem and psr emission treated as perturbation . but this formulation turns out insufficient to dynamically discuss two ( back to back ) mode propagation incorporating psr , which seems essential for dense medium . in the present work we shall be able to derive a fundamental set of semi - classical equations for the two mode and further present formulation of two color problem as well .",
    "the essential ingredient in our work is derivation of a more general quantum mechanical equation both for the medium ( bloch equation ) and the electromagnetic field ( extension of quantum maxwell equation to include two photon process ) . only after elucidating the nature of quantum state of fields and medium , namely , time evolving electric field condensate",
    ", we shall go on to the semi - classical equation . this way",
    "we determine how two back to back modes are precisely coupled beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "we ignore the granularity and rely on the continuum limit formulation of atom distribution , taking one spatial dimension alone , because the whole event is highly focused on one direction of irradiated trigger field taken as @xmath11 direction .",
    "the system of semi - classical partial differential equations thus derived is highly non - linear , and must generally be analyzed by numerical simulations . this way we find explosive and weak psr phenomena and under",
    "what conditions these may occur .    despite of its complicated non - linearity",
    "the system allows soliton solution of two kinds , which is obtained as steady state solutions of this non - linear system of fields and medium .",
    "solitons here , in their field part , are electric field condensate which may or may not be moving : there can be static field condensate .",
    "the stability ( against two - photon emission ) of solitons is ensured by a topological quantum number as explained in the text below .",
    "our conjecture , which is supported by numerical simulations , but not established by a more rigorous method , is that field condensate formed after rapid psr phenomena is made of many topological solitons .",
    "after formation of field condensates , namely a stable target state against two photon emission , the light may propagate almost freely .",
    "the condensate state of field plus medium thus formed may be very useful to detect a much weaker process such as radiative neutrino pair emission ( rnpe ) @xcite , because the condensate is not stable against rnpe .",
    "a related propagation and soliton formation problem in the single photon case is the phenomenon of self - induced transparency ( sit ) @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite presumably related to solitons of the kind of @xcite , both at a resonant frequency .",
    "both of these transparency phenomena thus appear to be directly related to formation of stable solitons of different kinds from ours .    for numerical computations below ,",
    "we use parameters relevant to a good target candidate for psr detection , para - h@xmath1 molecule .",
    "we have in mind using para - h@xmath1 vibrational transition of @xmath0 ( x being the electronically ground molecular state ) .",
    "many other atoms and molecules are conceivable for psr experiments .",
    "the characteristic length scale for large effects is @xmath12 cm , and the time scale @xmath13 ns for para - h@xmath1 of a molecule density of @xmath14@xmath3 .",
    "the number density dependence of these characteristic parameters is @xmath15 .",
    "we include relaxation effects of two time constants in the range of @xmath16 10 ns ( a feasible value experimentally ) and @xmath17 in our analysis .",
    "origin of these relaxation constants is left unexplained , and this way one may use values experimentally measured by other means .",
    "we perform extensive numerical simulation in order to clarify experimentally observable psr signals and condensate formation in forthcoming experiments .",
    "it is demonstrated that explosive psr emission occurs for long targets even by weak trigger when initial coherence between states , @xmath6 and @xmath18 , is present .",
    "we have identified two different types of psr events caused by trigger irradiation : ( 1 ) explosive psr in which most of the stored energy in the initial metastable state @xmath6 is released as a short pulse of some time structure , and ( 2 ) weak psr in which the output energy flux is in linear proportion to the trigger power .",
    "the natural unit @xmath19 is used throughout in the present paper .",
    "consider three level atom ( or molecule ) of energies , @xmath20 , as shown in fig([lambda - type atom ] ) .",
    "we assume that transition between two lower levels , @xmath6 and @xmath18 , are dipole forbidden .",
    "suppose that the upper level @xmath21 has substantial e1 rates both to @xmath22 .",
    "( this can be replaced by weaker m1 transition , since the relation we need subsequently is the partial decay rate @xmath23 with the energy level difference @xmath24 , which holds both in e1 and m1 cases . )",
    "we focus on , and derive an effective hamiltonian of , two lower levels interacting with oscillating electric field @xmath25 .",
    "its hamiltonian density has been derived in @xcite , @xcite for a single mode of field such as a light wave of definite frequency traveling in one direction .",
    "extension to multi - mode fields such as counter - propagating modes of the same frequency is given in appendix a. its hamiltonian has a form of @xmath26 matrix acting on two atomic states , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the multi - mode field @xmath25 may be decomposed into positive and negative frequency parts @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are slowly varying envelopes in time .",
    "we shall use variables , @xmath32 to simplify formulas given below . in quantum field theory @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "represent annihilation and creation operators of definite mode .",
    "the pertinent hamiltonian to our discussion of the single mode is @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 the number density of atoms per a unit volume in a linear target region of @xmath38 . for simplicity we took isotropic medium and linearly polarized fields , taking @xmath39 as scalar functions .",
    "the diagonal part @xmath40 of this hamiltonian describes ac stark energy shifts , while off - diagonal parts @xmath41 are for two photon emission and absorption .    for ph@xmath1 target",
    "the photon energy @xmath42 0.26 ev is much smaller than level spacings to the electronically excited intermediate states , both @xmath43 and @xmath44 11 ev . under this condition",
    "we may ignore @xmath45 compared to @xmath46 in the formula for @xmath47 and identify @xmath47 to the polarizability for which precision calculation exists @xcite .",
    "we thus use numerical values of parameters , @xmath48 all in the unit of @xmath49 @xmath50 @xcite for the ph@xmath51 transition .",
    "the density matrix of pure atomic states , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , obeys the evolution equation , @xmath54 \\ , .",
    "\\:$ ] this quantum mechanical equation is generalized to include dissipation or relaxation .",
    "the needed variable , the density matrix for the mixed state , is given by a statistical mixture of pure states : @xmath55 with @xmath56 a set of orthonormal pure state vectors .",
    "dissipation occurs when a subsystem of @xmath57 interacts with a reservoir and one integrates out reservoir variables due to our basic ignorance of the reservoir .",
    "the general form of mixed state evolution including dissipation has been derived by lindblad @xcite , assuming the general principle of positivity and conservation of probability . as its result",
    "the time evolution equation of the density matrix has additional operator term , @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the new additional dissipation term in the two level atomic system turns out equivalent to phenomenological relaxation terms given by two time constants , @xmath59 ( with the constraint @xmath60 from consistency with @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to write the evolution equations in terms of components of the bloch vector defined by @xmath61 .",
    "the basic bloch equation including relaxation terms is @xmath62 @xmath63 usually , and the phase decoherence time @xmath64 is much smaller and more important than the decay time @xmath65 , which may be taken infinitely large for our practical purpose .",
    "derivation of quantum field equation follows a similar line of reasonings . to perform the derivative operation @xmath66 as in the maxwell equation",
    ", one needs to calculate the double commutator ; @xmath67\\ , ] \\ , , \\hspace{0.5 cm } h = \\int d^3x ( { \\cal h}_f + { \\rm tr}\\ , \\rho { \\cal h}_i ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the field energy density @xmath68 . for convenience",
    "we add less dominant oscillating terms of field modes to @xmath69 and use the locally well behaved field @xmath70 in @xmath71 .",
    "the fundamental commutation relation in the radiation gauge qed @xmath72   = i \\partial_x \\delta^3 ( \\vec{r}- \\vec{r}\\ , ' ) $ ] @xcite is used for derivation of quantum field equation .",
    "the result is @xmath73 this equation @xcite along with the bloch equations ( [ bloch eq 1])@xmath74 ( [ bloch eq 3 ] ) is the basis of the following derivation of our master equation .",
    "fast oscillating terms do not contribute to global features of time and spatial evolution when one makes averaging over a few @xmath75 time and spatial oscillation periods .",
    "we thus extract terms that persist over time periods of typical light oscillation of order @xmath76 both in time and space .",
    "envelope functions denoted by @xmath77 ought to be amplitudes of right and left moving components of rapidly oscillating parts @xmath78 .",
    "the result of svea may be summarized using dimensionless units of spacetime coordinates @xmath79 and dimensionless fields @xmath80 given by @xmath81 the quantity @xmath82 gives a fundamental unit of target length and time scale of evolution .",
    "since a functional relation @xmath83 holds , the propagation problem of trigger irradiation of pair frequencies , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , is described by the same dimensionless quantities of a common @xmath86 .",
    "its value at @xmath87 is @xmath12 cm and @xmath74 0.5 ns for para - h@xmath1 of density @xmath88@xmath3 .",
    "the most general fundamental equations including both non - trivial propagation and psr effects are derived in appendix a and given by the formulas ( [ rescaled bloch eq1 ] ) @xmath74 ( [ rescaled quantum field eq2 ] ) .",
    "it is useful to recall the physical meaning of coupling constants @xmath47 in the interaction hamiltonian , in order to fully appreciate the following approximation in our numerical simulations .",
    "consider the extended hamiltonian including both of counter - propagating modes given by eq.([1c two modes hamiltonian ] ) in appendix .",
    "we first note that annihilation ( @xmath89 ) and creation ( @xmath90 ) operators of photon modes are related to complex fields by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the quantization volume .",
    "the important equations are obtained after svea and given in appendix a. they are written in terms of envelope functions : @xmath93 the right hand sides of these equations give effects , all in bulk medium , of forward scattering @xmath94 , backward scattering @xmath95 , rl- pair annihilation @xmath96 , and rr- , ll - pair annihilation @xmath97 .",
    "( the pair creation amplitudes appear in conjugate equations to those above . )",
    "quantities @xmath98 as defined by eq.([case of spatial graiting ] ) are what are called spatial grating in the literature .",
    "the backward scattering terms , and rr,- ll - pair annihilation and creation terms are important only in the presence of spatial grating of polarization .",
    "neglect of spatial grating is thus equivalent to retaining forward scattering and rl - pair processes , and ignoring all other terms . in the simple boundary condition set up below in this work",
    ", the backward bragg scattering is expected to be a minor effect , and is also neglected in most works of sr .",
    "we refer to @xcite on the backward bragg scattering effect in usual sr , and for instance to @xcite on the backward scattering effect on sr in low - q cavity experiments . in a more comprehensive simulation in future",
    "we wish to quantitatively compute effects of the backward scattering , rr- , ll - pair processes , because non - negligible differences of these effects might arise in psr unlike the sr case .    in the rest of the present work we shall focus on psr effects and ignore propagation effects which are much discussed in @xcite , @xcite and summarized in appendix a. explosive psr events discussed below",
    "are expected to be insensitive to neglected propagation effects .",
    "the resulting maxwell - bloch equation for the single mode is @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 here @xmath102 are relaxation times in the dimensionless unit .",
    "the dimensionless master equation ( [ rescaled bloch eq degenerate 1 ] ) @xmath74 ( [ rescaled quantum field eq : degenerate 2 ] ) is governed by two important parameters , the most important is @xmath103 and the next important is @xmath104 .",
    "another experimentally important parameter is the overall length and time @xmath105 , inversely scaling with the number density @xmath106 . for larger number densities of excited atoms",
    "a smaller size target and a shorter time measurement of o[ns ] becomes possible .    in terms of two component field @xmath107 defined below",
    "the equation reads as @xmath108 magnitudes of r- and l - fluxes change via rl mixing term such as @xmath109 r- or l - moving pulse alone propagates freely , because we ignored in this approximation non - trivial propagation effects .    as usual in quantum field theory , we may interpret @xmath110 as annihilation and @xmath111 as creation operator .",
    "the fact that the basic equation , ( [ rescaled quantum field eq : degenerate 1 ] ) @xmath74 ( [ rescaled quantum field eq : degenerate 2 ] ) or ( [ quantum field eq 1 ] ) , simultaneously contains both annihilation and creation operators of field implies that the quantum state satisfying the field equation is given by a bogoliubov transformation from the usual vacuum of zero photon state @xmath112 , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is to be determined by @xmath115 the quantum state @xmath116 is a mixture of infinitely many states of different photon number .",
    "we shall not pursue this line of thoughts any further , because we exploit the semi - classical approximation under the large quantum number limit of photons ( the classical limit ) .",
    "the semi - classical equation is given by the expectation value of quantum equation , @xmath117 with @xmath118 the bogoliubov state given by eq.([bogoliubov state ] ) .",
    "the semi - classical equation turns out equivalent to replacing q - field operators in the quantum equation by corresponding c - number functions .",
    "equations , ( [ rescaled bloch eq degenerate 1 ] ) @xmath74 ( [ rescaled quantum field eq : degenerate 2 ] ) , regarded as equations for c - number functions , thus constitute the master equation for polarization of medium and field .",
    "in our case of field condensate , medium polarization and fields are cooperatively involved : the target medium undergoes coherence oscillation , simultaneous with field oscillation , while keeping field envelopes slowly varying and finally almost time independent in a large time limit , as shown below .",
    "the field condensate part is technically equivalent to field state made of an infinite sum of multiple photon pair states in the so - called coherent state representation .",
    "it is important to clarify in detail the ideal case of numerical solutions where all quantities in eq.([rescaled bloch eq degenerate 1 ] ) @xmath119 ( [ rescaled quantum field eq : degenerate 2 ] ) are of order unity , in the range of @xmath120 $ ] . for a deeper understanding of numerical outputs and a practical check of accuracy of numerical results , it is useful to know conservation laws of our non - linear system .",
    "we list in appendix b all exact and approximate conservation laws that the system possesses .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations assuming cw ( non - pulsed continuous wave ) trigger laser irradiation of the same power from two target ends ( called the symmetric trigger ) .",
    "this boundary condition is similar , but not identical , to the one of cavity mirror .",
    "use of cavity mirrors has both advantage and complication .",
    "two mirrors in cavity automatically generate counter - propagating waves , and they effectively increase the trigger power ( which however is not critically needed in our case ) . on the other hand , each atom in cavity is affected by the same traveling fields many times and this complicates analysis .",
    "we use in the present work the simpler scheme of two cw counter - propagating triggers independently irradiated .",
    "numerical results show the symmetric output fluxes from two ends , and we exhibit in the following figures one of these identical fluxes from one end .",
    "result for the zero initial coherence @xmath121 is shown in fig([cw strong trigger ] ) .",
    "clear signature of delay much after @xmath64 ( @xmath122 in this case ) and explosive psr is observed for strong trigger fields .",
    "it is difficult to obtain commercially available cw laser of this power .",
    "a reason of this difficulty is that relaxation of order @xmath123ns may take over the coherence development under weak trigger usually exploited .",
    "explosive psr is a highly non - linear process having a definite trigger power threshold and disappears in this example certainly at the trigger power of 0.9 mwmm@xmath124 , as shown in the inset of fig([cw strong trigger ] ) .        in fig([cw strong trigger ] ) the complete inversion to the level @xmath6 has been assumed as an initial condition , and it would be interesting to relax this condition and to further clarify neglected effects of the presence of initial coherence between two atomic levels , @xmath6 and @xmath18 .",
    "there is an experimental method to imprint an initial coherence between @xmath125 and @xmath126 by adopting a clever excitation scheme .",
    "the atomic state right after excitation can be made a coherent mixture of two pure states , @xmath6 and @xmath18 , namely @xmath127 with @xmath128 at a single atomic site , by using the technique of stirap @xcite .",
    "this kind of pure state may be formed by time overlapping excitation pulses of two frequencies , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the state is a dark state , called so because no emission from @xmath21 is observed despite of irradiation capable of making both transitions , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    the medium polarization @xmath133 in the dark state is given by @xmath134 with @xmath135 the fraction in the state @xmath27 .",
    "when this type of initial polarization of the dark state is formed , one may expect to expedite the coherence development for psr , as shown in the following section . when cw laser is used for trigger",
    ", two overlapping pulses may induce psr at the same time when the emission from @xmath136 disappears : thus it may be called psr from the dark .",
    "we first comment on what the number density @xmath106 of target precisely means .",
    "this is the total number of atoms / molecules per a unit volume participating in psr phenomena , hence it is the added sum of densities in the states , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note also that the state @xmath28 may or may not be the ground state of atoms or molecules .",
    "for instance , in the ph@xmath1 transition of @xmath137 , the target number density @xmath106 may be much less than the ground state number density since @xmath138 is also an excited state .",
    "time evolution from a dark state of initial polarization value given by eq.([dark state of ri ] ) is illustrated for the ph@xmath1 number density @xmath139@xmath3 in fig([power dependence of psr ] ) @xmath74 fig([r3 profile 2 ] ) .",
    "we exhibit dependence of the symmetric output pulse on the trigger power in the range of @xmath140wmm@xmath124 for @xmath141@xmath3 in fig([power dependence of psr ] ) , which demonstrates two important features of explosive psr with the presence of a large initial coherence : ( 1 ) the highest peak of psr output is almost independent of the trigger power , suggesting a sudden , macroscopic release of energy ( its density @xmath142 ) stored between two levels , @xmath125 and @xmath143 , ( 2 ) the onset time of explosive events , which may be called the delay time , depends on the input trigger power very weakly , and a linear logarithmic dependence has been confirmed up to 1 pw mm@xmath124 ( instantaneous enhancement factor @xmath144 in this case ) .",
    "a similar logarithmic power dependence of the delay time has been observed in numerical simulations of the single photon superradiance when the system is subjected to the trigger .",
    "the integrated flux is @xmath145 with @xmath146 the time width of explosive event .",
    "$ ] and this integrated flux is estimated as @xmath148 $ ] , a quantity independent of the target number density @xmath106 , if the explosive event occurs .",
    "these figures show dramatic effects of initial coherence of the dark state .",
    "observation of explosive events requires a target length @xmath149 .",
    "detailed time structure of pulses as observed in fig([power dependence of psr ] ) may differ if one adopts different available experimental parameters , but the output release of energy flux of order @xmath150 is universal in explosive psr events .",
    "spatial profiles of field fluxes and polarization components , @xmath133 , within the target are illustrated in fig([energy density profile ] ) @xmath74 fig([r3 profile 2 ] ) . in this parameter set ,",
    "about @xmath74 30 % of the stored energy @xmath151 ( the corresponding flux unit being @xmath152 wmm@xmath153 ) still remains in the target much after explosive psr , and we observe a seemingly stable target state .",

    "so far we mostly showed explosive outputs in which most of the stored energy between @xmath125 and @xmath126 is released in a short time @xmath161ns after time delay .",
    "there is however a linear regime under a large initial coherence @xmath162 in which the output flux is amplified in proportion to the trigger power .",
    "for instance , the amplification factor is @xmath163 in the trigger power range of 1 @xmath164wmm@xmath165 wmm@xmath124 for three different choices of initial @xmath133 values of fig ( [ output in linear regime ] ) . in this figure",
    "we show the output fluxes in the linear regime taking as an example the trigger power of 1 mwmm@xmath124 .",
    "although not shown in this figure , the linearity of the output power to the trigger power has been checked for this set of parameters .",
    "in addition to dramatic explosive psr emission it is also important to watch remnants after psr emission , since previous figures at latest times may be taken to suggest formation of objects of non - trivial spatial profiles .",
    "let us derive for this purpose the asymptotic form of fundamental equations .",
    "we anticipate that both the medium polarization @xmath166 and fields @xmath167 little change with time in the time region of @xmath168 after psr emission . by taking vanishing time derivatives ,",
