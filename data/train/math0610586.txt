    "<S> bauer and itzykson showed that associated to each labeled map embedded on an oriented riemann surface there was a group generated by a pair of permutations . from this result an algorithm may be constructed for enumerating labeled maps , and this construction is easily augmented to bin the numbers by the genus of the surface the map is embedded in . </S>",
    "<S> the results agree with the calculations of harer and zagier of 1-vertex maps ; with those of bessis , itzykson , and zuber of 4-valent maps ; and with those of ercolani , mclaughlin , and pierce for @xmath0-valent maps .    </S>",
    "<S> we then modify this algorithm to one which counts unoriented maps or mobius graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the results in this case agree with the calculation of goulden and jackson on 1-vertex unoriented maps . </S>"
