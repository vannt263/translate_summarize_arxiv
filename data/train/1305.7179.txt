    "we develop and test computational evolution algorithms based upon a recent proof of the well - posedness of characteristic initial value and boundary problems for a scalar wave  @xcite .",
    "well - posedness requires the existence of a unique solution which depends continuously upon the data with respect to an appropriate norm .",
    "characteristic problems consist of finding a solution of a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations where the initial data is given on a characteristic hypersurface , i.e. a lightlike hypersurface for the case of scalar waves in minkowski space . whereas , the cauchy problem for initial data on a spacelike surface is well posed with respect to an @xmath0 norm , this is not necessarily true for the cauchy problem for initial data on a characteristic surface . for example",
    ", the characteristic cauchy problem for the equation , @xmath1 , on the domain @xmath2 with compact source @xmath3 and compact initial data @xmath4 on the characteristic @xmath5 , allows the solution freedom @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is independent of the initial data .",
    "this lack of uniqueness caused by waves entering from past null infinity ( @xmath8 ) can not be remedied by requiring a finite @xmath0 norm ( integrated over @xmath9 ) because this would also rule out the existence of bonafide waves generated by the source @xmath10 which travel to @xmath11 .",
    "however , the recent work  @xcite showed that the corresponding cauchy problem for the modified wave equation @xmath12 is well posed with respect to an @xmath0 norm .",
    "when translated back , this result corresponds to the well - posedness of the original problem with @xmath13 in terms of a finite @xmath0 norm that is exponentially weighted by the factor @xmath14 , which rules out waves entering from @xmath8 but allows waves from the source to propagate to @xmath11 . in this sense ,",
    "the original problem is well posed as an initial - boundary value problem with a boundary condition at @xmath8 .",
    "however , the benevolent behavior of the modified equation is more general .",
    "the cauchy problem for ( [ eq:1 dm ] ) on the periodic domain @xmath15 is well posed , and this property extends to higher dimensional wave equations , e.g. @xmath16 this is a surprising result since the problem with @xmath17 is well posed even when the characteristics in the @xmath9-direction form closed lightlike curves , in which case a signal propagates instantaneously back to the emitter .",
    "the corresponding problem with @xmath18 is ill posed .",
    "the importance of the condition @xmath17 on a lower order term had not been previously recognized in the characteristic initial value problem for the wave equation .",
    "these results based upon the modified wave equation generalize to characteristic initial value problems for quasilinear waves in higher dimensions .",
    "furthermore , this approach allows application to characteristic problems the standard technique  @xcite of proving well - posedness by splitting the problem into a cauchy problem and a local half - plane problem , and then proving that these individual problems are well posed .",
    "in particular , the main result in  @xcite is the well - posedness of the null - timelike initial - boundary value problem for quasilinear scalar waves @xmath19 propagating on an asymptotically flat curved space background with source @xmath10 , where the metric @xmath20 and its associated covariant derivative @xmath21 are explicitly prescribed functions of @xmath22 . in coordinates based upon the retarded time",
    "@xmath23 outgoing lightcones , the metric takes the bondi - sachs form  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 are angular coordinates along the outgoing light rays , @xmath26 is a surface area coordinate and the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 have the appropriate falloff for asymptotic flatness .",
    "the quasilinear wave equation ( [ eq : qw ] ) with asymptotically flat metric ( [ eq : nullmet ] ) becomes : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the covariant derivative with respect to the conformal 2-metric @xmath30 .",
    "the null - timelike problem on this background consists of determining @xmath33 in the region @xmath34 given data @xmath35 on the initial null hypersurface @xmath5 and on the timelike worldtube @xmath36 .",
    "the well - posedness of this problem was established in  @xcite by considering the modified problem in terms of the variable @xmath37 , with @xmath17 , which has the same effect as the @xmath38-term in ( [ eq : aterm ] ) .",
    "the use of null coordinates , as introduced by bondi  @xcite , was key to the understanding and the geometric treatment of gravitational waves in the full nonlinear context of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture underlying the null - timelike problem for einstein s equations  @xcite is that the worldtube data represent the outgoing gravitational radiation emanating from interior matter sources , while ingoing radiation incident on the system is represented by the initial null data .",
    "this problem has been developed into a cauchy - characteristic matching scheme in which the worldtube data is supplied by a cauchy evolution of the interior sources ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "although characteristic evolution codes have been successful at simulating many such problems , the well - posedness of the null - timelike problem for the einstein equations has not yet been established .",
    "the recent proof of well - posedness of the corresponding problem for the quasilinear wave equation ( [ eq:3dwe ] ) is a first step toward treating the gravitational case  @xcite .    in this paper , we show how this new approach can be implemented as numerically stable characteristic evolution codes .",
    "the fundamental understanding of characteristic evolution is in a primitive state in comparison to cauchy evolution .",
    "for that reason , it is most useful to restrict our attention to model problems in a 3-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the stability of variable coefficients and quasilinear problems is based upon the stability of constant coefficients problems under lower order perturbations .",
    "the model problems considered here provide the basis for the stable treatment of more general problems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : alg ] we establish the stability of characteristic evolution algorithms for the cauchy problem .",

    "[ sec : testbound ] we test this algorithm , and simulate the effect of boundaries .",
    "the standard finite difference conventions , notation and techniques are described in  @xcite , where further details can be found .",
    "we consider the cauchy problems for a scalar field @xmath33 for the double - null system @xmath39 and the null - timelike system @xmath40 with smooth initial data @xmath41 and source @xmath42 , where @xmath38 and @xmath43 are real constants .",
    "both the @xmath44 and @xmath9 directions are characteristic ( lghtlike or null ) for ( [ eq : simple ] ) , whereas the @xmath44 direction is timelike for ( [ eq : simple2 ] ) .",
    "we include the @xmath45 term to illustrate how lower order terms enter the analysis .",
    "note that the systems ( [ eq : simple ] ) and ( [ eq : simple2 ] ) are not transformable into each other and have essentially different stability properties ( compare ( [ eq : rsteo ] ) and ( [ eq : dampr ] ) below ) .    in  @xcite the well - posedness of these problems , for @xmath17 ,",

    "we apply these methods to establish the stability of the discretized version of these problems .",
    "we approximate ( [ eq : simple ] ) on a uniform spatial grid @xmath46 by @xmath47 and approximate ( [ eq : simple2 ] ) by @xmath48 in terms of the second order accurate centered ( @xmath49 ) and sidewise ( @xmath50 ) finite difference operators  @xcite acting on the grid function @xmath51 .",
    "for this cauchy problem , we keep the time variable continuous and use the method of lines to treat the resulting system of ordinary differential equations .      the analysis given in  @xcite showed that both the double - null and null - timelike problems are well posed for @xmath17 .",
    "although there are growing modes , for any initial data @xmath52 there is a constant @xmath53 which does not depend upon @xmath54 and @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , so that the growth rate is bounded . for @xmath57 ,",

    "after substituting ( [ eq : f2d ] ) in ( [ eq : simple ] ) , we obtain the fourier space evolution equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 thus for @xmath64 there are growing modes with @xmath65 . however , for @xmath17 , @xmath66 so that the exponential growth is bounded independently of @xmath67 and the problem is well posed .    for the null - timelike problem ( [ eq : simple2 ] ) ,",

    "since the numerator of ( [ eq:7 ] ) is bounded , an examination of the denominator of ( [ eq:7 ] ) shows that this is certainly true if there is a constant @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for all @xmath87 .",

    "it is necessary to show that the finite difference equation ( [ eq : dsimple ] ) is stable against lower order perturbations . for that purpose ,",
