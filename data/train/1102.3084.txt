    "the generation and propagation of interfaces in reaction - diffusion systems is of great importance in a variety of scientific and technological contexts . in nature , the interface often spatially separates two macroscopically different homogeneous regimes in which one phase or product dominates another one . typically , at least one particle - type diffuses through the medium while reacting with other particles .",
    "births and deaths depend on the spatial location and on the presence of other particle - types .",
    "then , when installing appropriate initial and boundary conditions one often sees the appearance of an interface and one asks for the typical temporal behavior in its initial growth and further propagation .",
    "the case we treat here is boundary driven from one side , with symmetric bulk diffusion for one particle type that invades the region of a second particle type , while constantly being annihilated by yet a third type of particles .",
    "that creates a moving phase boundary and thus goes under the general name of stefan problem @xcite .",
    "the present work is inspired by experimental investigations on plasma damage in porous low - capacitive materials ( low-@xmath2 , see @xcite ) .",
    "one imagines here a porous sioc material which is exposed via one of its physisorbedaries to radicals such as active oxygen atoms .",
    "these radicals diffuse through the material while removing hydrophobic carbon - hydrogen groups and while being chemi - adsorbed in the pores of the material .",
    "one then observes the appearance and motion of an interface separating a rich ( pristine ) carbon - phase from a damaged ( oxygen - rich ) layer .",
    "it is important here to understand the time - dependence of that motion and its dependence on diffusion and reaction parameters , which can further be related to material and chemical properties .",
    "we come back to this application in the separate section [ app ] .",
    "of course , the literature on interface motion from reaction - diffusion equations is vast , and many different phenomena have been reported .",
    "in particular , damage spreading and related front propagation can take many different forms which we can not at all review here ; see e.g.  @xcite for general research aspects .",
    "as just one very famous example for one - dimensional front propagation , as we also have here , reaction - diffusion equations such as of the type of kolmogorov - petrovsky - piskounov show interface motion between two homogeneous phases at constant speed @xcite . that then takes the form of travelling waves in which one phase advances over the other phase . here , however , the proposed model shows the motion of the interface @xmath3 ( in one dimension as function of time @xmath4 ) to be logarithmic which means that after an initial period diffusion saturation occurs .",
    "the main point is that the diffusive motion is boundary driven and that the propagation is limited by the reactions . for the purpose of the application ,",
    "the logarithmic behavior is caused by the disappearance of the oxygen radicals before reaching the moving interface separating them for the carbon - rich environment .",
    "the @xmath5 within the logarithm , mostly visible in an initial time - period , originates directly from the diffusive motion .",
    "the next section contains the specific mathematical model in the form of coupled partial differential equations .",
    "they give a mean - field description of the reaction - diffusion system .",
    "the main finding is the change from a diffusive to a specific logarithmic time - dependence for the interface @xmath6 as above , with the study of dependencies on initial conditions and dynamical parameters . we give a physical heuristics for understanding the basic characteristics via a linearized model .",
    "+ the section [ num ] on numerical results summarizes the behavior of our model , as a function of the physical parameters .",
    "our results agree with the analytical results of the linearized model , but the higher flexibility of simulations allow for obtaining additional information and predictions concerning the dependence on the various parameters in the model .",
    "section [ app ] goes deeper into the specific application that triggered our study , that of the propagation of damage in porous low-@xmath2 materials .",
    "we recall the main aspects and the meaning of our result for that context .",
    "in particular , reference @xcite contains already the basic set of differential equations , but no systematic analysis was performed and the distinction between different ( one - sided ) boundary conditions was not considered .",
    "the present paper also adds the interesting connections with reaction - diffusion systems of stefan type .",
    "there are three types of particles .",
    "the first are called free o - particles , which can diffuse but can also change into bound o - particles and further annihilate with either bound o - particles or with c - particles : @xmath7 and no other reactions or diffusions take place .",
    "the letters are chosen in the context of the later application in section [ app ] with o for oxygen and c for carbon .",
    "the word `` free '' will there be understood as `` reactive '' and `` bound '' will mean adsorbed to the inner surface , either physically or chemically .",
    "once oxygen atoms are absorbed on the surface they start to move around until they recombine and desorb . in other words , since in the experimental conditions desorption of bounded oxygen molecules typically occurs through recombination , reversible desorption is not taken into account , @xcite . for the moment",
    "we continue to use the more general words `` free '' and `` bound , '' as the mathematical set - up can have different natural realizations .",
    "+ the dynamics is further determined by the initial condition at time zero when there are only c - particles with homogeneous density , and by the boundary conditions .",
    "the physics we have in mind concerns a three - dimensional region of locations @xmath8 , which is isotropic over the @xmath9coordinates . for the boundary conditions at the @xmath10 plane we consider two possibilities .",
    "the first , of dirichlet - type , specifies a constant density of free o - particles at @xmath10 ; the second , of von neumann - type , gives a constant flux of particles entering the region at @xmath10 . for the questions and",
    "the problem at hand we restrict ourselves to an effective mean field treatment , ignoring fluctuations or microscopic inhomogeneities , and the geometry is one - dimensional .",
    "we consider the coordinate @xmath11 in which to express the profile of particle densities as a function of time @xmath12 .",
    "there are thus three types of concentrations @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively for free o - particles , c - particles and bound o - particles .",
    "the reaction - diffusion system is then defined via the equations @xmath15 where the dotted left - hand sides are time - derivatives .",
    "the concentration @xmath16 ( of the free o - particles ) undergoes a second spatial derivative in the right - hand side of the first line of ; the parameter @xmath17 being the diffusion constant .",
    "the other parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive reaction rates .",
    "the initial condition @xmath20 specifies @xmath21 meaning that we start with c - particles fully occupying the material . on the other hand , the boundary conditions ( @xmath10 )",
    "can be taken either @xmath22 where we can take @xmath23 without loss of generality ; the @xmath24 stands for the rate of free o - particles entering the region which for the moment we leave as a parameter .",
    "it seems more natural to opt for von neumann - type boundary conditions for the specific application we have in mind , but we checked that after a transient time there is really no difference between dirichlet and von neumann conditions . in the case of von neumann - type boundary conditions , the value @xmath25 converges from being zero at time zero to a fixed finite value ( equal to some @xmath26 depending on @xmath27 ) exponentially fast as time evolves . as a consequence , we mostly concentrate on just one type , that of dirichlet boundary conditions with @xmath28 for all times , but further discussion on possible differences will follow below .",
    "the results of numerical integration of the differential equations are detailed in section [ num ] .",
    "our main finding is that the concentration @xmath29 of c - particles ( defining the absence of damage in the application of section [ app ] ) shows an interface @xmath6 separating a c - poor from a c - rich phase .",
    "there are _ a priori _ a number of different possible mathematical definitions of the position of the interface @xmath6 .",
    "a first one is to solve @xmath30 ( or some other number ) for @xmath6 , which certainly makes sense when the interface is sharp enough , after some transient time , but is less useful for very small times .",
    "a second definition uses the same conditions as above but we add the equation @xmath31 for the interface speed . that brings the problem in the natural neighborhood of stefan problems @xcite , also valid for very small times but more involved numerically .",
    "whatever ( reasonable ) definition we take for @xmath6 we invariably find that the motion is logarithmic of the general form @xmath32 in a typical range of parameters for diffusion and reaction rates @xmath33 and @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on these parameters , see also in section [ num ] . for small times the motion is diffusive @xmath36 while it saturates as @xmath37 for large times @xmath4 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is basically determined by the amount of reactivity , the more the o - particles can be annihilated , the faster saturation sets in .",
    "an approximate treatment towards the second stefan - like definition of the interface motion described above can already be made visible for a much simpler linear system to which we turn next .",
    "we simplify to a one - component reaction - diffusion equation by imagining an autonomous linear dynamics for @xmath16 of the form @xmath38 the equation mimics the first line of in the approximation @xmath39 constant , which we expect to be mostly reasonable when @xmath40 and @xmath41constant which makes sense in the damaged region ( @xmath42 ) where the carbon was depleted .",
    "the right boundary denoted by @xmath43 in what follows therefore plays the role of interface .",
    "we also can think of @xmath44 as a measure of reactivity and interaction , while @xmath45 measures the diffusion .",
    "the main advantage is of course that now the equation can be solved exactly with boundary conditions @xmath46 and initially @xmath47 .",
    "the solution is @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the stationary solution on @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "in fact we see that @xmath51 converges exponentially fast to @xmath49 with rate @xmath52 uniformly in @xmath43 .",
    "we can already learn a great deal from the behavior at the edge @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath54 we think now of @xmath43 as the position @xmath55 of the interface and @xmath56 is then the speed of the interface , so that stefan s condition @xmath57 can be integrated to give @xmath58\\ ] ] we clearly recognize the behavior @xmath59 for large times @xmath4 resulting in a straight line in fig .  1 and intersecting the vertical axis ( small @xmath4 ) at @xmath60 .",
    "for small times @xmath4 gives @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for small @xmath52 .",
    "we can thus find the effective @xmath45 and @xmath44 for from the intersections of the @xmath6 as function of @xmath63 with the vertical axis , as in fig .  1 , which provide consistency checks for our modeling equations .",
    "+ similarly , we can also solve with von neumann - type boundary condition  @xmath64 but still putting @xmath65 and initially @xmath47 .",
    "the solution is @xmath66,\\;\\ ; k\\equiv\\sqrt{\\beta / d}\\nonumber\\\\ & = &   -\\sum_1^\\infty b_n\\cos \\frac{(n-1/2)\\pi}{\\ell}x \\;\\;\\mbox { which determines the } b_n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] exponentially fast in time @xmath4 , @xmath67 , and hence we find that for @xmath68 the von neumann condition imitates the dirichlet condition with fixed @xmath69 and @xmath70 for large @xmath43 , at least for @xmath71 . clearly then , when the rate @xmath44 would go to zero , some differences between dirichlet and von neumann ( one - sided ) boundary conditions can be expected , as we indeed recover in section [ infres ] for the real model .",
    "the next section goes back to the full nonlinear model equations but we will find the many general features to be similar to our chosen approximation above .",
    "we now turn to the full set of equations , and switch to computer simulations .",
    "first , we study the system for a specific set of parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and apply dirichlet boundary conditions ; the primary motivation for this specific choice of the parameters lies in their numerical convenience .",
    "we apply a forward euler integration scheme to equations with a time step of @xmath76 , and store the density profiles of c - particles , free and bound o - particles at times @xmath77 . based on our analytic solution of the simplified description",
    ", we expect that for long times the interface position @xmath6 , defined as the ( linearly interpolated ) location where the c - particle density equals 1/2 , changes in time as @xmath78 , for some values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 which are determined by the system parameters @xmath81 and @xmath19 .",
    "1 shows that this expected long time behavior is confirmed by the simulation data .     as a function of time . for longer times",
    ", the curve approaches a straight line , indicating that asymptotically @xmath82.,height=377 ]    in the same simulations , we also determined the concentrations of c - particles and free o - particles as a function of position , for the times @xmath83 .",
    "these are @xmath29 respectively @xmath51 in equations .",
    "the resulting profiles of c - concentration are shown in fig .",
    "the c - density profile attains a sigmoid - like shape , which gradually moves deeper into the material . as the times of the curves",
    "are separated by a factor of two , and the depth increases with the logarithm of time , the curves are more or less equidistant .    the concentration profile of free o - particles is shown in fig .",
    "the general shape is that of an exponentially decaying curve up to the interface position @xmath6 , after which it decays again exponentially , but with a much steeper slope .",
    "once the interface has significantly moved into the material , the gradient of free o - concentration at the surface becomes constant even though we applied dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this confirms our earlier analytic observation that the behavior for dirichlet and von neumann conditions soon becomes indistinguishable .    .",

    "note that the top panel has a linear vertical scale , while the lower panel has a logarithmic vertical scale.,height=377 ]      an important ingredient is to understand the influence of the diffusion constant @xmath45 on the temporal behavior of the interface .",
    "after all , the porosity and the architecture of the material can modify exactly that diffusive behavior .",
    "we repeated the simulations with different values for the diffusion coefficient : @xmath84 and 4 .",
    "3 shows the rescaled interface position @xmath85 , indicating that the main effect of variations in @xmath45 is a rescaled amplitude : @xmath86 , as expected from the linear model in .",
    "it appears therefore that we understand the influence of the connectivity of the porous material on the time - dependence of the interface .     as a function of time , for simulations in which @xmath84 and 4 . for longer times , the curves fall on top of each other , indicating that asymptotically @xmath87.,height=377 ]      the adsorption of the free o - particles and the chemical annihilation of the free o - particles with the bound o - particles ( e.g. to create a @xmath88 molecule which is chemically neutral for c - particles ) and with the c - particles is the reactive content of our model .",
    "obviously the c - particles must remain to define an interface at all , but we can imagine lowering very much the adsorption of the free o - particles . in the extreme case",
    "we exclude the adsorption of free o - particles by setting @xmath89 .",
    "then , we have @xmath90 always and everywhere which simplifies somewhat . in the case of dirichlet type - boundary condition @xmath91 , we basically have transport of o - particles through a layer of size @xmath6 with difference in concentration fixed ( and equal to 1 ) : we thus expect from fick s law that the current @xmath92 is proportional to the concentration gradient which gives us @xmath93 .",
    "we have checked that this behavior is indeed found for very small adsorption rates , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "4 shows the numerical evidence .",
    "+ on the other hand , with von neumann boundary condition @xmath96 and for very small absorption rates @xmath94 and @xmath95 , there is a continuous influx of free o - particles leading to a concentration of them at the surface which increases in a power law fashion . that can be understood from the following calculation",

    "we thus conclude that @xmath104 grows as @xmath5 .",
    "numerically , we find that the lack of saturation of free o - concentration at the exposed surface does not alter the asymptotic behavior of the interface , but it does lead to a logarithmic correction .",
    "the behavior is consistent with @xmath105 . also for von neumann boundary conditions , numerical evidence is presented in fig .",
    "4 .     as a function of time , for simulations in which the adsorption of free oxygens is excluded .",
    "with dirichlet boundary conditions , the asymptotic behavior can be well fitted by @xmath93 ; with von neumann boundary conditions , this becomes @xmath106.,height=377 ]",
    "low dielectric constant ( low-@xmath2 ) materials are typically used in semiconductor manufacturing to compensate for the rc - delay and power consumption increase in microelectronic devices associated with their continuing scaling - down @xcite .",
    "the microelectronics community has adopted @xmath2 as a representation of the relative permittivity or dielectric constant in contrast to the scientific communities using @xmath107 . nowadays ,",
    "porous low-@xmath2 dielectrics based on silica and silsesquioxanes with 10 - 15% of organic hydrophobic groups are the most favoured class of materials for advanced interconnect technology nodes @xcite .",

    "is needed ( the @xmath2-value of air is close to 1 ) @xcite .",
    "advanced low-@xmath2 materials have a porosity of 25 - 50% and a typical pore size being close to 22.5 nm .",
    "although the matrix of these materials has properties similar to traditional sio@xmath111 , their chemical stability and reactivity strongly depend on porosity .",
    "materials with interconnected pores are chemically active because of the high diffusion rate of active chemicals .",

    "+ during device fabrication , the porous low-@xmath2 dielectrics are exposed to various plasmas that might degrade their properties .",
    "the most challenging plasma treatment is related to plasmas based on oxygen- or hydrogen containing chemistries that are used to remove organic photo - resist masks used for pattern transfer from the low-@xmath2 films @xcite .",

    "two commonly known approaches are used for the photo - resist mask removal : ( i ) a low temperature , low pressure anisotropic plasma , where the photo - resist is removed by an ion - assisted process , oxidizing or reducing plasma chemistries at low temperatures @xcite and ( ii ) hydrogen - based downstream plasma ( dsp ) where the resist is removed at high temperatures by a thermally activated chemical process @xcite . according to recent publications @xcite ,",
    "both approaches remove c from low-@xmath2 materials . however , ion - assisted processes remove hydrophobic si - ch@xmath112 groups and graphitized - c ( residual - c that remains after film fabrication ) , while a thermally activated chemical process with hydrogen plasma removes only graphitized - c from low-@xmath2 dielectrics . in both cases",
    "the depth of c - carbon removal can be directly measured with spectroscopic ellipsometry @xcite .",
    "various experimental results have shown the typical time - dependence of the depth of c - removal .",
    "in particular the typical logarithmic time - dependence was observed , as the one we have derived in the present paper .",
    "+ the depth of the plasma radical penetration in the low-@xmath2 pores determines the extent of plasma damage .",
    "clearly then , the role of knudsen diffusion is important and our analysis in section [ difro ] clarifies some aspects .",
    "for example , the extent of plasma damage can be a few times higher for mesoporous dielectrics with high porosity levels in comparison with nanoporous dielectric with low porosity levels @xcite .",
    "+ as a word of caution and limitations of our approach , plasma damage of low-@xmath2 materials is a complex phenomenon that results in changes of their bonding structure and pore morphology @xcite .",
    "the complexity also increases due to the fact that porous low-@xmath2 dielectrics are usually amorphous materials with a random pore structure @xcite .",
    "our set of reaction - diffusion equations can be generalized to include some of these aspects but soon a more detailed simulation analysis becomes necessary .",
    "the propagation of damage when a pristine material is exposed to diffusing and reacting particles saturates logarithmically .",
    "the initial position of the interface is diffusive @xmath115 but soon saturates @xmath1 when reactions prohibit the propagation of the damage .",
    "the problem can be modeled as a reaction - diffusion system of coupled differential equations where the position of the interface can be determined by viewing it as a stefan problem .",
    "we have discussed dirichlet and von neumann boundary conditions , solved a linear approximation and we have found the detailed influence of reactivities and diffusivity .",
