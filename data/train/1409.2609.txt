    "electron properties in two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional disordered media @xcite , crystalline lattices with structural defects @xcite , spin glasses with random interactions @xcite and systems exhibiting criticality modified by the presence of disorder @xcite , are all instances of pronounced disorder effects in the bulk of the materials that can fundamentally change the behavior of idealized model systems .",
    "apart from their fundamental importance in modifying the bulk properties , disorder effects at surfaces and interfaces are particularly important in the context of the solid - electrolyte interphases @xcite relevant also for energy generation and storage technologies @xcite . the structural disorder in the charge distribution and/or dielectric response spatial profile in the vicinity of the material interfaces couple to long - range electrostatic interactions , leading effectively to long - range disorder effects as well @xcite , that can not be understood in terms of the usual assumptions of piecewise homogeneous charge distribution and/or dielectric properties , underpinning so much of colloid science and electrochemistry @xcite .",
    "the coupling between electrostatic interactions and disorder has been already noted and discussed in other important cases @xcite , including surfactant - coated surfaces @xcite , random polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes @xcite , and contaminant adsorption onto macroscopic surfaces or in amorphous films showing grain structure after being deposited on crystalline substrates @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the charge distribution often shows a fundamentally disordered component that often remains unaltered after the assembly or fabrication of the materials , thus exhibiting a frozen , or _ quenched _ , type of disorder ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for examples of surfaces with _",
    "annealed _ charge distributions that will not be considered in this paper ) .",
    "this charge disorder coupled to the long - range electrostatic interactions can then leave its fingerprint also on the interactions between macromolecular surfaces that in their turn can play a fundamental role in the stability of colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , this coupling between disorder and coulomb interactions has been suggested to underly the anomalously long - ranged interactions observed in ultrahigh sensitivity experiments on casimir - van der waals interactions between surfaces _ in vacuo _ @xcite .",
    "the intricate experimental details of accurate measurements of these interactions can be properly accounted for only if one considers also the disordered nature of charges on and within the interacting surfaces by invoking the so - called _ patch effect _",
    "@xcite , where the disorder stems , for instance , from the adsorption of charged contaminants and/or impurities that can give rise to monopolar random surface charges , and/or the variation of the local crystallographic axes of the exposed surface of a clean polycrystalline sample and the corresponding electron work function that can cause a variation of the local surface potential .",
    "such random distributions of surface charges can be measured directly by kelvin force microscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "the salient features of electrostatic interactions themselves , even for homogeneous charge distributions in the absence of any disorder , are however quite involved ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been recognized some time ago that electrostatic interactions in fact come in several varieties , depending on the strength of electrostatic coupling in the system @xcite . in the presence of mobile monovalent counterions , they are standardly described by the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory stemming from the mean - field , collective description of coulomb fluids @xcite that gives rise to pronounced repulsive interactions between like - charged macromolecules ( such as polymers , colloids and nano - particles ) . on the contrary , in the presence of multivalent counterions , electrostatic interactions exhibit basically a single - particle character and mediate strong attractive interactions between like - charged macromolecules",
    "this attraction led to a new understanding of the theory of electrostatic interactions in colloidal domain based on the _ strong - coupling ( sc ) limit _",
    "@xcite , devised to describe the equilibrium properties of coulomb fluids when charges involved become large . in the simple case of a counterion - only system , the transition from the mean - field pb description , dubbed also the _ weak - coupling ( wc ) limit _ , to the sc limit",
    "is governed by a single dimensionless _ electrostatic coupling parameter _ @xcite , being a ratio of the bjerrum length , which identifies coulomb interaction between counterions themselves , and the gouy - chapman length , which describes electrostatic interaction between the counterions and the charged ( macromolecular ) surfaces .",
    "the emerging picture of equilibrium properties of coulomb fluids has thus become much richer than conveyed for many years by the standard dlvo paradigm of colloid science @xcite .",
    "however , this is still not the complete story .",
    "the most relevant case of a coulomb fluid is in fact not a counterion - only system , but an asymmetric mixture of multivalent ions in a bathing solution of monovalent ions , a particularly relevant situation specifically in the context of bio - macromolecules , where multivalent ions together with the screening properties of the monovalent salt are believed to play a key role in the stability of macromolecular aggregates such as liquid crystalline mesophases of semiflexible biopolymers @xcite , or dna condensates that form in the bulk @xcite or within viruses or virus - like nano - capsids @xcite .    in an asymmetric mixture , multivalent counterions and monovalent ions",
    "are coupled differently to the macromolecular charges : multivalent ions strongly , while monovalent ions only weakly , as evidenced from their respective electrostatic coupling parameters .",
    "since usually multivalent ions are present at very low concentrations , e.g. , around just a few mm , their behavior is expected to be properly described within the virial expansion in powers of their fugacity ( or bulk concentration ) @xcite . a _ dressed multivalent - ion theory _ then emerges naturally within this context @xcite since the degrees of freedom due to weakly coupled monovalent ions can be traced out from the partition function , leading to an effective formalism based on screened interactions between the remaining dressed multivalent ions and fixed macromolecular charges .",
    "the dressed multivalent - ion theory for complicated asymmetric mixtures of multivalent ions in a bathing solution of monovalent ions can then seamlessly bridge between the standard wc and sc limits @xcite .",
    "these baroque features of electrostatic interactions furthermore give their imprint also on the effects of disordered charge distribution along macromolecular interfaces @xcite . while on the wc level and for homogeneous planar systems the quenched disorder effects are nonexistent @xcite , they can lead to qualitative changes in the stability properties of the system once the dielectric contrast between the solution and macromolecular interfaces ( or the inhomogeneous distribution of salt ions ) is taken fully into account @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is in the sc limit that the coupling between electrostatic interactions and the quenched disorder in the external interfacial charge distributions gives rise to fundamentally novel and unexpected phenomena @xcite .",
    "while studying the interaction between two disordered charged surfaces it was noticed @xcite that disorder can in fact lead to a lowering of the effective temperature of the system , engendering a distribution of the multivalent counterions between the interacting surfaces that is characterized by less effective entropy .",
    "this is intuitively difficult to foresee , as one would perhaps naively assume that thermal and externally imposed charge disorder would somehow enhance one another .",
    "in order to properly understand and identify all salient features of the coupling between quenched charge disorder and long - range electrostatic interactions , we now proceed to characterize more closely the consequences of coupling between charge disorder and _ electrostatically strongly coupled _",
    "multivalent counterions immersed in a monovalent salt solution bath . in particular , we will identify the defining feature of this strongly coupled , disordered system as belonging to the _ anti - fragility _ @xcite exhibited by this system . in the present context",
    ", anti - fragility simply refers to the fact that an externally imposed , quenched charge disorder , effectively diminishes the intrinsic thermal disorder in the system , forcing its behavior to be more ` ordered ' .",
    "we will show that this behavior stems from the interplay between the _ translational entropy _ of the multivalent counterions and the _ configurational entropy _ due to the averaging over different realizations of the quenched disorder . in the particular example of the counterion - only model ( with no monovalent salt ions and no interfacial dielectric discontinuity ) ,",
    "we show that multivalent counterions experience an additional logarithmic attraction towards the surface due to the presence of the surface charge disorder in a way that their density profile exhibits an algebraically singular behavior at the surface with an exponent that depends on the disorder strength ( variance ) .",
    "this behavior persists also in the presence of a monovalent salt bath and results in significant violation of the contact - value theorem @xcite . in the presence of an interfacial dielectric discontinuity",
    ", depleting the counterion layer at the surface , the charge disorder still generates a much enhanced counterion density further away from the surface .",
    "likewise , the charge inversion and/or overcharging of the surface are predicted to occur more strongly and at smaller bulk concentrations of multivalent counterions when the surface carries quenched charge disorder .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce our model and then in section [ sec : formal ] present the theoretical formalism that will be used to study the distribution of multivalent counterions next to a randomly charged dielectric interface .",
    "we then proceed to present our results in section [ sec : results ] , where we discuss the case of counterion - only systems and the effects due to the presence of a bathing salt solution , an interfacial dielectric discontinuity , and also the overcharging and charge - inversion phenomena in the system .",
    "we conclude our discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our model is comprised of an infinite , planar dielectric slab of thickness @xmath0 and dielectric constant @xmath1 , immersed in a bathing ionic solution of dielectric constant @xmath2 ( see fig . [",
    "f : schematic ] ) .",
    "the ionic solution is assumed to consist of a mixture of a monovalent 1:1 salt of bulk concentration @xmath3 as well as of a multivalent @xmath4:1 salt of bulk concentration @xmath5 .",
    "the dielectric slab is assumed to be impermeable to mobile ions and occupy the region @xmath6 with its surface normal oriented in the direction of the @xmath7-axis .",

    "the multivalent counterions are in contact only with the charged surface ( right).,width=302 ]    in what follows , the general formalism is valid for an arbitrary shape of the charged boundaries , but for the later developments in this paper we shall delimit ourselves to the specific example of a planar slab as noted above . in this case , the mean charge distribution and its variance are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath18 and , for the multivalent counterions , @xmath19 . the monovalent salt is assumed to be present on both sides of the slab while the multivalent counterions are restricted to the right half - space @xmath20 .",
    "this spatial constraint can be taken into account formally by introducing the indicator functions @xmath21 for the multivalent counterions , and @xmath22 for the monovalent ions , where @xmath23 is the heaviside s step function .",
    "this constraint can be realized by enclosing the region on the left side of the slab in a membrane impermeable to multivalent ions ; such a constraint will be relevant in our analysis only in the situations where the slab thickness is small relative to the salt screening length and will otherwise have vanishing impact on the distribution of multivalent counterions next to the charged surface in the regime of parameters that will be of interest in this paper .",
    "for the most part , however , we shall focus on the case of semi - infinite slabs .",
    "another point to be noted here is that , for the sake of simplicity , we model the monovalent and multivalent ions as point - like particles . since the monovalent ions will be treated implicitly ( section [ sec : formal ] ) , the generalization of our formalism to include a finite size for the multivalent counterions ( which can have a relatively large size as compared with the monovalent ions ) is quite straightforward and we shall return to it in section [ subsec : ion - size ] , where we also analyze its consequences .",

    "this leads to a complex situation where different components of the coulomb fluid couple differently to the same surface charges , thus making the analytical progress and , in particular , obtaining exact solutions @xcite , very difficult .    nevertheless , progress is possible and systems of this type can be treated using a combined weak - strong coupling approximation , which has been discussed in a series of recent works @xcite .",
    "it was shown , by employing both analytical approaches as well as implicit- and explicit - ion simulations that , in a wide range of realistic system parameters , the monovalent ions can be treated safely within the debye - hckel ( dh ) framework , while the multivalent ions can be handled by means of a standard virial expansion scheme @xcite of the strong coupling approximation .",

    "it thus seems appropriate to refer to this type of behavior of the multivalent counterions as _ anti - fragile _",
    "@xcite , since introducing an external ( quenched ) disorder source effectively diminishes the intrinsic thermal disorder in the system and drives it towards a more ` ordered ' state .    another interesting point to be noted here is that the internal energy of the system also decreases due to the presence of disorder but in such a way that leads to a decrease in the free energy of the system as can be seen from the free energy difference , @xmath102 .",

    "<S> we study the distribution of multivalent counterions next to a dielectric slab , bearing a quenched , random distribution of charges on one of its solution interfaces , with a given mean and variance , both in the absence and in the presence of a bathing monovalent salt solution . </S>",
    "<S> we use the previously derived approach based on the _ dressed multivalent - ion theory _ that combines aspects of the strong and weak coupling of multivalent and monovalent ions in a single framework . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of quenched charge disorder on the charged surface of the dielectric slab is shown to substantially increase the density of multivalent counterions in its vicinity . in the counterion - only model ( with no monovalent salt ions ) , the surface disorder generates an additional logarithmic attraction potential and thus an algebraically singular counterion density profile at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior persists also in the presence of a monovalent salt bath and results in significant violation of the contact - value theorem , reflecting the _ anti - fragility _ effects of the disorder that drive the system towards a more ` ordered ' state . in the presence of an interfacial dielectric discontinuity , depleting the counterion layer at the surface , the charge disorder still generates a much enhanced counterion density further away from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the charge inversion and/or overcharging of the surface occur more strongly and at smaller bulk concentrations of multivalent counterions when the surface carries quenched charge disorder . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the presence of quenched surface charge disorder leads to sizable effects in the distribution of multivalent counterions in a wide range of realistic parameters and typically within a distance of a few nanometers from the charged surface . </S>"
