    "in recent years , color centers in diamond have been investigated as solid state light emitters especially in the context of single photon sources ( e.g. , refs .  ) or , if incorporated into nanodiamonds , as fluorescence labels for _ in vivo _ imaging ( e.g. , refs .  ) . for these applications , color centers in diamond stand out owing to feasible room temperature operation as well as a high photostability . for applications in _ in vivo _",
    "imaging , biocompatibility @xcite of the nanodiamonds and a large variety of possible surface functionalizations @xcite add to the advantages .",
    "the majority of previous experiments utilizes the well known nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) color center in diamond .",
    "nevertheless , nv centers suffer from a major disadvantage , namely their broad room temperature emission bandwidth of about induced by strong electron - phonon coupling.@xcite recently , silicon vacancy ( siv ) centers emerged as a promising alternative.@xcite in contrast to nv centers , siv centers enable narrow bandwidth room temperature single photon emission with a linewidth down to and a high brightness ( up to ) .@xcite the narrow bandwidth results from low electron - phonon coupling leading to a significant concentration ( exceeding 70% ) of the luminescence in the narrow , purely electronic transition , i.e. , the zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) , at approx .  .",
    "furthermore , single siv centers enable fully linearly polarized single photon emission,@xcite which is advantageous for applications in quantum cryptography @xcite or in the frequency conversion of single photons.@xcite siv centers can be efficiently produced _ in situ _ by incorporation of si impurities during chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) of diamond.@xcite furthermore , the production of colloidal solutions of fluorescent nanodiamonds containing siv centers from polycrystalline cvd diamond films has been demonstrated.@xcite thus , siv centers are also promising candidates for fluorescence labels especially due to feasible excitation with red laser light as well as their narrow emission in the red / near - infrared spectral region.@xcite for single photon emission as well as fluorescence labels , a further extension of color center emission into the longer wavelength near - infrared spectral range is of interest . despite the promising applications introduced above , several fundamental characteristics of the siv complex are still unsettled : the charge state of the siv center responsible for the zpl as well as the spatial symmetry of the complex are still under debate.@xcite in addition , a generally accepted suggestion for the electronic level scheme of the siv center is still lacking .    in this work ,",

    ", absorption measurements of single crystal cvd diamond samples containing high densities of siv centers are reported : the authors found absorption lines in a wavelength range ( 830860 nm ) similar to the wavelength range of the nir pl we observe here .",
    "the detection of a transition in absorption indicates that it involves the ground state of the system and only for purely electronic transitions , absorption and emission occur at the same wavelength .",
    "one thus might suspect that the nir pl is attributed to an electronic transition from the shelving state to the ground state .",
    "similarly , for nv centers , radiative transitions between shelving states ( singlet states ) have been reported at .@xcite however , in the context of single color center spectroscopy , one has to make sure that the sharp pl lines do not belong to other color centers incorporated together with the siv centers during cvd growth ( e.g. , nickel - related centers emitting between and ) .@xcite in this work , we prove exemplarily for a single siv center with pronounced nir emission that the nir line arises from an additional , independent purely electronic transition that can not be explained within the established three level model .",

[ g2simulations](a ) and ( b ) ] , @xmath64 raises to a constant value of one within several as the rate coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath40 are much smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the simulated @xmath64 is in stark contrast to @xmath23 measured on the line [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : g2](c ) ] .",
    "the @xmath0 measurements thus exclude that the line arises due to a transition between the shelving state ( state 3 ) and the ground state ( state 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath23 measurements exclude that the nir line arises due to the transition @xmath78 : for a process involving state 2 as an intermediate state , @xmath55 should be at least as long as @xmath34 .    ,",
    "width=257 ]    we emphasize that the zpl and nir line can not arise from a cascaded emission as the cross - correlation measurements do not reveal a bunching , thus we can exclude that one of the transitions populates the excited state of the other transition.@xcite furthermore , the photon energy of the excitation laser is which is well below the sum of the energies for both transitions ( and ) .",
    "additionally , the linear dependence of the fluorescence on excitation power for both transitions excludes multi - photon processes for the excitation .",
    "as the @xmath18 measurements prove that the nir line and the zpl originate from the same emitter , we propose an extended level scheme including the nir transition as depicted in fig .",
    "[ 5levelscheme ] . on the basis of the evidence presented above",
    ", we assume that the nir line originates from an independent electronic transition , i.e. , a second zpl .",
    "we introduce the nir transition @xmath79 as a third relaxation path into the level scheme ( fig .",
    "[ 5levelscheme ] ) .",
    "as @xmath20 matches the @xmath0 function of a three level system , state 5 should not accumulate population ( as it is the case for state 3 ) : this would induce deviations from the three level @xmath0 function . the short antibunching time constant @xmath55 supports the assumption of a fast decay path .",
    "thus , this pathway , similar to fast non - radiative decay paths , might not lead to a deviation from the @xmath0 function of a three level system .",
    "we assume that the relaxation to state 5 occurs from the intermediate pumping level in the off - resonant pumping process : for a process involving state 2 as an intermediate state , @xmath55 should be at least as long as @xmath34 , as the filling of state 5 from state 2 would limit the antibunching time constant .",
    "the relaxation rate coefficients from the pumping level are not directly accessible in our measurements .",
    "we assume these rate coefficients significantly exceed any other coefficients in the system ensuring that the pumping level does not accumulate population .",
    "this assumption is justified , as the vibrationally excited states that are most probably responsible for the pumping transition used here feature very short lifetimes in the picosecond range.@xcite the ratio of the relaxation rates from the pumping state to state 5 and to state 2 should influence the branching ratio for the zpl and the nir line . however , taking into account also a potentially differing quantum efficiency , we can not use the intensity ratio of the lines to deduce the branching ratio .",
    "for a two level system at low excitation powers , @xmath34 indicates the lifetime of the excited state of the radiating transition assuming no longer lived states are populated in the excitation process .",
    "thus , from the @xmath0 measurements , one might expect a very bright emission from the line due to a short lifetime .",
    "however , the fraction of the population available for the line is unsettled taking into account the unknown branching ratio of the transition from the pumping level to states 2 and 5 . in principle",
    ", the lower brightness might be linked to a more efficient quenching mechanism for the nir luminescence resulting in a low quantum efficiency.@xcite non - radiative quenching of low energy transitions has been reported for nv@xmath58 centers : the infrared emission at is four orders of magnitude weaker than the visible emission despite the fact that 30% of the population is available for the infrared transition.@xcite    in the following , we further analyze the @xmath18 measurements and infer the switching dynamics of zpl and nir line .",
    "@xmath18 reveals a fully symmetric antibunching .",
    "an asymmetric antibunching would indicate that the time elapsing between the emission of an nir photon and a zpl photon is different from the time elapsing for the reverse order of events.@xcite in our model , the two lines are populated via the same pumping transition and share the same ground state , consistent with the observation of a symmetric cross - correlation . for the interpretation of the cross - correlation time constant @xmath80 , we consider ref .   where @xmath18 measurements between disjunct spectral windows of the pl transition of a single quantum dot have been introduced .",
    "the emission line is broadened by spectral diffusion , consequently a change of the emission wavelength from one spectral window to the other requires a spectral jump of the emitter . @xmath18",
    "exhibits an antibunching , where @xmath80 reveals the characteristic time @xmath81 for the spectral jumps . interpreting our measurements analogously",
    ", @xmath80 reveals the characteristic time for the siv center to change its emission between the nir and zpl transitions . as @xmath80 is comparable to the lifetime of the excited state ( state 2 )",
    ", the changes occur in between successive excitation and emission cycles of the zpl .",
    "this short characteristic time also supports the assumption of an alternative decay path connecting the pumping levels and the ground state of the center without involving the long lived shelving state : the longer time windows , in which the emitter resides in the shelving state ( state 3 ) do not influence the measured @xmath18 function between the zpl and the nir lines if the level scheme in fig .",
    "[ 5levelscheme ] is applicable .",
    "additionally , @xmath18 indicates that the siv center changes between the two emission lines frequently instead of undergoing a larger number of transitions on either the zpl or the nir line before changing its emission wavelength again .",
    "photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of single siv centers frequently feature very narrow room temperature pl lines in the near - infrared spectral region , mostly between and .@xcite in this work , we clearly prove for a single siv center , that this pl ( at ) is due to an additional electronic transition ( besides the well known zpl here at ) .",
    "we find a linewidth of ( ) for the nir line .",
    "the nir line saturates at similar excitation power as the zpl .",
    "however , despite a shorter excited state lifetime deduced from the @xmath0 measurements , it delivers a factor of four lower fluorescence intensity .",
    "a @xmath18 measurement between the zpl and the nir line reveals anti - correlated emission , thus proving that the emission originates from the same emitter .",
    "the short antibunching time constant in the @xmath18 measurements indicates a fast switching between the transitions .",
    "@xmath0 auto - correlation measurements exclude that the nir emission arises due to a transition from / to the shelving state of the siv center .",
