    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model postulate the existence of fermionic partners for all standard model bosons , scalar bosonic partners for all standard model fermions , and at least two complex higgs doublet fields , each containing a charged and a neutral component  @xcite .",
    "the partners of the @xmath97 weak hypercharge field @xmath98 and the neutral component of the @xmath99 weak isospin field @xmath100 ( gauginos ) , and of the two neutral components of the higgs fields ( higgsinos ) , mix to form the four neutralinos @xmath101 , where the index increases with the neutralino mass .",
    "the higgsino partners of the charged components of the higgs fields and gaugino partners of the charged components of the weak isospin field mix to form the charginos @xmath102 , where the index 1 indicates the lighter chargino .",
    "susy particles couple to the same standard model particles as their standard model partners .",
    "the lightest charginos may thus be pair - produced at lep in @xmath103-channel @xmath104 or @xmath105 exchange .",
    "their gaugino components can also be pair - produced in @xmath106-channel scalar electron neutrino ( @xmath107 ) exchange if the @xmath107 is sufficiently light .",
    "the chargino pair production cross - section is expected to be large  @xcite .",
    "it is typically a few picobarns ( pb ) and depends on the mass and mixing parameters of the susy model ; however , the interference between the @xmath103-channel and @xmath106-channel processes is destructive , so if there is a light @xmath107 the cross - section can be small . if r - parity conservation is assumed , as it is throughout this paper , the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , which is expected to be either the @xmath108 or a @xmath109 , is stable and undetectable .",
    "if the lsp is the @xmath108 , neutralinos are most likely to be detected in associated production of @xmath110 , either through @xmath103-channel @xmath104 or @xmath105 exchange or by @xmath106-channel @xmath111 exchange if there is a light scalar electron .",
    "neutralino cross - sections are comparable to those for chargino pair production only if the higgsino component is predominant ; however , if charginos are too massive to be pair - produced , neutralino associated production may be the only susy process with a visible signature at lep  @xcite .",
    "in such cases , the neutralino search can be used to rule out regions of susy parameter space which are not accessible to the chargino search .",
    "a list of the chargino and neutralino production and decay modes considered in this paper , along with a few final states which were not considered , is given in table  [ tab : processes ] .",
    ".principal production and decay modes for the lightest charginos and neutralinos in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "all detectable final states consist of missing energy and jets or charged leptons or both .",
    "the final states above the horizontal line in each category are considered in this paper .",
    "the chargino three - body leptonic decays are analyzed in  @xcite , and the efficiencies , background estimates , candidates and likelihood distributions from that analysis are used in this paper to set cross - section limits on chargino production .",
    "chargino two - body decays and neutralino invisible and leptonic decays listed below the lines are not considered here when setting limits , although the chargino two - body leptonic decays with the stable @xmath109 in the final state are analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "[ tab : processes ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the fractional contribution of each background was then calculated for the rest of the mass grid and the relative errors on each background scaled according to the contribution of that background at each point .",
    "the systematic errors for each background at each grid point are then added in quadrature and eventually summed in quadrature with the statistical error on the background .",
    "the efficiency errors are summed in quadrature and a total relative systematic error of 7% is applied to the signal efficiencies and summed in quadrature with the statistical uncertainties .",
    "once the systematic errors have been evaluated for the signal efficiency and background expectation at every point on the mass grid for all energies , the limit setting code is run twice more over the data : once with all the efficiencies decreased by their errors and all background expectations increased by their errors to give the worst expected sensitivity , and once with the efficiencies increased and backgrounds decreased to give the best expected sensitivity .",
    "there are then three limits for each point in the grid : the standard one , @xmath112 , the one standard deviation `` worst case '' one , @xmath113 , and the one standard deviation `` best case '' one , @xmath114 .",
    "all are evaluated at a centre - of - mass energy of 208  gev .",
    "a gaussian - weighted average of these gives the limit convolved with the systematic errors : @xmath115 this is a three - point integral ; it is a simple and robust way to deal with large errors , which tend to make more complex methods unstable . despite the large relative errors on the background expectation , the limits typically change by only about 0.0010.02  pb , with an increase of about 0.1  pb for the hadronic channel in the `` @xmath116 '' region where @xmath117 and an increase of several picobarns along the @xmath118  gev `` two - photon '' strip for the semileptonic channel .",
    "in order to give a visual impression of what the limits might look like in the absence of a signal , `` expected '' limits are calculated . for each point on the mass grid ,",
    "an average is made of the cross - section limits from a hundred toy monte carlo experiments . in each experiment ,",
    "a random number of `` events '' is generated using a poisson distribution with a mean value of @xmath119 , the expected number of background events for the mass grid point .",
    "each `` event '' is assigned a random likelihood @xmath120 from the background likelihood distribution @xmath121 .",
    "the signal cross - section limit is then calculated just as it is for the data .",
    "the limit observed is in general slightly higher than the expected limit ; however , the 95% confidence level limit on @xmath122 ( shown in figure  [ fig : hadron ] ) is below about 0.3  pb almost up to the kinematic limit for @xmath123  gev and well below 0.1  pb in most of the parameter space explored , whereas a chargino signal would be expected to have a cross - section of several picobarns .",
    "the observed limits are not as stringent as the expected ones ; however , the 95% confidence level limit on @xmath124 ( shown in figure  [ fig : semilep ] ) is below about 0.3  pb almost up to the kinematic limit for @xmath123  gev and well below 0.1  pb in much of the parameter space explored .",
    "the observed 95% confidence level limits on @xmath125 taken from  @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : lepton ] and are slightly better than the expected limits .      if the lightest neutralino is the lsp , chargino branching ratios to final states containing @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the @xmath126 decay branching ratios , except for very low values of @xmath129 where the leptonic branching ratio increases rapidly .",
    "the three channels are combined according to @xmath126 branching ratios and these results , which are generally valid in the absence of light scalar leptons and scalar neutrinos , are shown in figure  [ fig : wstar ] .      since",
    "only the hadronic channel was analyzed for neutralino associated production , the results are presented both as a limit on @xmath130 ( figure  [ fig : neuthad ] ) and as a limit on @xmath131 assuming 100% @xmath132 branching ratios for @xmath5 decay ( figure  [ fig : neutral ] ) . the 95% confidence level limit on the cross - section is less than 0.1  pb for @xmath133  gev to within about a gev of the kinematic limit .",
    "there is no value of @xmath134 for which a significant excess is observed .    despite the small general excess which results in larger than expected cross - section limits in the hadronic and semileptonic channels ,",
    "there is no indication of chargino or neutralino production in the opal data .",
    "the experimental information required to obtain limits in any particular model is contained in the cross - section limit for chargino production as a function of the leptonic branching ratio and in the cross - section limit for neutralino associated production as a function of the invisible branching ratio . comparing the limits with the cross - section and leptonic branching fraction predicted by any specific model",
    "allows that model to be tested with the opal data .    in this section ,",
    "the results are interpreted in the context of the contrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "this is a model inspired by minimal supergravity , in which it is assumed that at some large grand unification ( gut ) scale all of the gauginos have a common mass @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that there is a fixed relation between the three gaugino masses at the electroweak scale , @xmath136 for @xmath137 partners , @xmath138 for @xmath99 partners , and @xmath139 for @xmath140 partners , so a single free parameter , taken to be @xmath138 , generates all the gaugino masses .",
    "it is also assumed that the sfermions ( but not all scalars as in true minimal supergravity ) have a common mass at the susy - breaking scale , denoted by @xmath141 . with these constraints , there are only six free parameters not present in the sm : @xmath138 , @xmath141 , the common trilinear sfermion - higgs coupling at the planck scale @xmath142 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values for the higgs doublet fields coupling to down- and up - type quarks @xmath143 , the mass mixing parameter of the higgs fields @xmath144 , and the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath145 . with these six parameters ,",
    "it is possible to calculate cross - sections for @xmath146 and @xmath147 production .",
    "the properties of the charginos and neutralinos depend chiefly on @xmath138 , @xmath144 and @xmath143 .",
    "if @xmath148 , then the lightest neutralino is higgsino - like and @xmath106-channel contributions are negligible ; the @xmath149 and @xmath150 are all close in mass and the cross - section for @xmath147 production is similar to that of @xmath146 production .",
    "if @xmath151 then the @xmath152 is gaugino - like ; @xmath106-channel processes are important and may interfere destructively with the @xmath103-channel .",
    "scans over @xmath138 and @xmath144 are done at several values of @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath141 and @xmath142 parameters determine the masses of the sfermions .",
    "results here are shown for @xmath153 , implying that there are no light sleptons or sneutrinos , and two - body decays of charginos to @xmath154 can be ignored , and for @xmath155 , which generally means that mixing of left- and right - handed sfermion eigenstates is assumed to be small .",
    "a scan is performed with susygen  @xcite over the region @xmath156  gev , @xmath157 at @xmath158 .",
    "the granularity of the scan depends on the region and is generally between 1 and 5  gev in @xmath138 and @xmath144 .",
    "the simplest thing to do with the cross - section limits obtained in the previous section and the results of the cmssm scan is to see what regions of the parameter space are excluded . by construction , the three chargino channels do not use the same events , so the best way to use this information is to sum the limits for the three channels according to the branching ratios predicted by susygen for a particular set of @xmath159 values and compare with the susygen prediction for the chargino total cross - section .",
    "the events selected in the neutralino associated production search may overlap with the events selected in the chargino search , so the optimal way to include both searches is to calculate whether the expected limit for the chargino or the neutralino search would give the better exclusion for a particular @xmath159 , and use the channel which is expected to be better . exclusions in the @xmath160 plane are shown in figure  [ fig : m2mu ] for the five values of @xmath143 studied .",
    "these exclusions are valid only for @xmath161  gev and for @xmath155 .",
    "the regions which are shown as kinematically accessible but not excluded correspond to regions where @xmath110 production is possible , but with an expected cross - section too small to be excluded .",
    "the final step is to see what masses of charginos and neutralinos are excluded in the cmssm .",
    "the kinematically accessible regions of the @xmath162 and @xmath163 planes are divided into a 1 by 1  gev grid .",
    "all of the scanned @xmath164 points are examined to see what masses they predict for the lightest chargino and two lightest neutralinos .",
    "the smallest cross - section predicted in any 1 by 1  gev grid square is compared with the cross - section limit .",
    "the cmssm exclusions for the chargino mass plane are shown for the five values of @xmath143 in figure  [ fig : charmassexcl ] and the neutralino mass plane exclusions are shown in figure  [ fig : neutmassexcl ] .    assuming that @xmath161  gev and @xmath155 , the following conclusions can be made .",
    "for @xmath133  gev , charginos with masses less than 101  gev are excluded for all @xmath143 . for @xmath133  gev ,",
    "@xmath5 with masses less than 78  gev and @xmath108 with masses less than 40  gev are excluded for all @xmath143 .",
    "no hint of charginos or neutralinos was observed in the data from opal .",
    "the cross - section limits presented in this paper for charginos or neutralinos decaying to particular final states may be regarded as completely model - independent and can be used to set limits on any model .",
    "limits are set on the cross - section for chargino pair production by combining the three chargino final states under the assumption that all charginos decay to a virtual @xmath165 , which then decays with the usual branching ratios to leptons and hadrons .",
    "limits are calculated for the specific example of the constrained mssm in the absence of light sfermions or mixing between right- and left - handed sfermions .",
    "charginos are excluded almost up to the kinematic limit set by the maximum lep beam energy of about 104  gev .",
    "we particularly wish to thank the sl division for the efficient operation of the lep accelerator at all energies and for their close cooperation with our experimental group .",
