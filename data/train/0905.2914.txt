    "an important application of atomistic - to - continuum coupling methods is the study of the quasistatic deformation of a crystal in order to model instabilities such as dislocation formation during nanoindentation , crack growth , or the deformation of grain boundaries  @xcite . in each of these applications",
    ", the quasistatic evolution provides an accurate approximation of the crystal deformation until the evolution approaches an unstable configuration .",
    "this occurs , for example , when a dislocation forms or moves or when a crack tip advances .",
    "the crystal will then typically undergo a dynamic process until it reaches a new stable configuration . in order to guarantee an accurate approximation of the entire quasistatic crystal deformation , up to the formation of an instability , it is crucial that the equilibrium in the atomistic / continuum hybrid method is stable whenever the corresponding atomistic equilibrium is .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate whether the quasicontinuum ( qc ) method has this property . in technical terms , this requires sharp estimates on the stability constant in the qc approximation .",
    "the qc method is an atomistic - to - continuum coupling method that models the continuum region by using an energy density that exactly reproduces the lattice - based energy density at uniform strain ( the cauchy - born rule )  @xcite .",
    "several variants of the qc approximation have been proposed that differ in how the atomistic and continuum regions are coupled  @xcite . in this paper , we present sharp stability analyses for the main examples of conservative qc approximations as a means to evaluate their relative predictive properties for defect formation and motion .",
    "our sharp stability analyses compare the loads for which the atomistic energy is stable , that is , those loads where the hessian of the atomistic energy is positive - definite , with the loads for which the qc energies are stable .",
    "it has previously been suggested and then observed in computational experiments that inconsistency at the atomistic - to - continuum interface can reduce the accuracy for computing a critical applied load  @xcite . in this paper , we give an analytical method to estimate the error in the critical applied load by deriving stability criteria in terms of the derivatives of the atomistic potential .",
    "although we present our techniques in a precise mathematical format , we believe that these techniques can be utilized in a more informal way by computational scientists to quantitatively evaluate the predictive capability of other atomistic - to - continuum or multiphysics models as they arise .",
    "for example , our quantitative approach has the potential to estimate the reduced critical applied load in qc approximations such as the quasi - nonlocal qc approximation ( qnl ) , that are consistent for next - nearest interactions but not for longer range interactions .",
    "since the longer range interactions are generally weak , such an estimate may give an analytical basis to judging that the reduced critical applied load for qnl with finite range interactions is within an acceptable error tolerance .",
    "the accuracy of various qc approximations and other atomistic - to - continuum coupling methods is currently being investigated by both computational experiments and numerical analysis  @xcite .",
    "the main issue that has been studied to date in the mathematical analyses is the rate of convergence with respect to the smoothness of the continuum solution ( however , see  @xcite for analyses of the error of the qc solutions with respect to the atomistic solution , possibly containing defects ) . some error estimates have been obtained that give theoretical justification for the accuracy of a qc approximation for all loads up to the critical atomistic load where the atomistic model loses stability  @xcite , but other error estimates that have been presented do not hold near the atomistic limit loads .",
    "it is important to understand whether the break - down of these error estimates is an artifact of the analysis , or whether the particular qc approximation actually does incorrectly predict an instability before the applied load has reached the correct limit load of the atomistic model .",
    "two key ingredients in any approximation error analysis are the consistency and stability of the approximation scheme . for energy minimization problems",
    ", consistency means that the truncation error for the equilibrium equations is small in a suitably chosen norm , and stability is usually understood as the positivity of the hessian of the functional . for the highly non - convex problems we consider here , stability must necessarily be a local property : the configuration space can be divided into stable and unstable regions , and the question we ask is whether the stability regions of different qc approximations approximate the stability region of the full atomistic model in a way that can be controlled in the setup of the method ( for example , by a judicious choice of the atomistic region ) .    in this work ,",
    "we initiate such a systematic study of the stability of qc approximations . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate conservative qc approximations , that is , qc approximations which are formulated in terms of the minimization of an energy functional . in a companion paper @xcite ,",
    "we study the stability of a force - based approach to atomistic - to - continuum coupling that is nonconservative .    in computational experiments ,",
    "one often studies the evolution of a system under incremental loading .",
    "there , the critical load at which the system `` jumps '' from one energy well to another is often the goal of the computation .",
    "thus , we will also study the effect of the `` stability error '' on the error in the critical load .",
    "we will formulate a simple model problem , a one dimensional periodic atomistic chain with pairwise next - nearest neighbour interactions of lennard - jones type , for which we can analyze the issues layed out in the previous paragraphs .",
    "it is well known that the uniform configuration is stable only up to a critical value of the tensile strain ( fracture ) .",
    "we use analytic , asymptotic , and numerical approaches to obtain sharp results for the stability of different qc approximations when applied to this simple model .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    ", we describe the model and the various qc approximations that we will analyze . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we study the stability of the atomistic model as well as two consistent qc approximations : the local qc approximation ( qcl ) and the quasi - nonlocal qc approximation ( qnl ) . we prove that the critical applied strains for both of these approximations are equal to the critical applied strain for the atomistic model , up to second - order in the atomistic spacing .",
    "a similar analysis for the inconsistent qce approximation is more difficult because the uniform configuration is not an equilibrium .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec : ana : qce ] , we construct a first - order correction of the uniform configuration to approximate an equilibrium configuration , and we study the positive - definiteness of the hessian for the linearization about this configuration .",
    "we explicitly construct a test function with strain concentrated in the atomistic - continuum interface that is unstable for applied strains bounded well away from the atomistic critical applied strain .    in section  [ sec : discus ] , we analyze the accuracy in predicting the critical strain for onset of instability . for the qcl and qnl approximations , this involves comparing the effect of the difference between their modified stability criteria and that of the atomistic model . for qce , since the solution to the nonlinear equilibrium equations are non - trivial",
