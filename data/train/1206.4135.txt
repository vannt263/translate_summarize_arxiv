    "there are many known and proposed sources of transient radio wave emission in the universe  from well - known terrestrial , solar system and galactic sources to a menagerie of hypothesised sources covering a broad range in terms of potential detectability and plausability .",
    "many of the known sources recur , e.g. solar radio bursts occur every day  @xcite and the pulses from some radio pulsars repeat so reliably that they can be used as ` cosmic clocks ' to detect the stochastic gravitational wave background  @xcite .",
    "some bursts however are less regular in their recurrance , and indeed several radio transients have never been observed to repeat .",
    "this latter group are of particular interest , especially as a number of the postulated sources are one - time - only events which would never repeat , and as the numbers detected should rise dramatically with the onset of the ` all - sky transient monitoring ' capabilities of lofar  @xcite , the vla  @xcite , meerkat  @xcite , askap  @xcite and ultimately the ska  @xcite .",
    "the numerous radio pulsar surveys constitute a rich , and perhaps the best available , data archive for exploring the parameter space of potential radio transients  especially at millisecond to second scales .",
    "many have never been searched for transient bursts .",
    "in one such search of the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey ( pmps , @xcite ) , a highly - dispersed single burst of radio emission was discovered  @xcite .",
    "this burst , which was detected , in a beam with @xmath7  arcmin half - power radius , in the direction of ra @xmath8 18:52:05 , dec @xmath8 @xmath908:29:35 , i.e. l @xmath8 @xmath10 , b @xmath8 @xmath11 , is the subject of this paper . in   [ sec : pulse ] we describe the properties of the pulse . in   [ sec : solutions ] we consider possible solutions as to its origin . throughout",
    ", we present the corresponding discussion for the ` lorimer burst ' ( lb from herein ) reported by @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : conc_disc ] we present our conclusions and a discussion on these matters .",
    "the pulse in question was received in the pmps on june 21st 2001 ( mjd 52081 ) in observation pm0141_017a1 , i.e. in beam a ( the 10th beam , in the outer hexagonal ring of the receiver ) in the 17th pointing recorded on survey tape 141 .",
    "the observation started at 12:57:32 utc ( mjd @xmath12 utc ) and the pulse was detected @xmath13 seconds into the observation , i.e. at 13:02:10.795 utc ( mjd @xmath14 utc ) .",
    "the simbad astronomical database lists only 7 sources within a radius of @xmath7 arcmin : six are optical / ir stars , and one is an x - ray source .",
    "there are no h@xmath15 or hi anomalies at this position .",
    "_ characteristics _ : the pulse was detected in only one of the 13 beams of the receiver , with a peak signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : sweep ] shows the pulse as a function of observing time and sky frequency .",
    "a frequency - dependent delay is evident . the dispersion measure ( dm ) which produces the highest s / n ,",
    "when dedispersed with respect to the standard relation for a cold ionised interstellar medium @xmath17 , is @xmath18 .",
    "testing how well such a law is obeyed by fitting for a frequency - dependent delay function which is proportional to @xmath19 gives @xmath20 .",
    "this is robust to dividing the 96-channel data into as many as 16 parts , before obtaining a time - of - arrival ( using standard pulsar timing methods ) at each sub - band and then fitting . for 16 sub - bands",
    "the average s / n per sub - band is @xmath21 .",
    "finer frequency resolution results in unacceptably low s / n in the sub - bands .",
    "the observed pulse width , when the data are dedispersed to @xmath22  mhz ( the top of the band ) using a dm of @xmath0 , is @xmath2  ms , ( the pmps time resolution is @xmath23s ) .",
    "the pulse width is @xmath24  ms in the top half of the band ( dedispersed to @xmath22  mhz ) and @xmath25  ms in the bottom half of the band ( dedispersed to @xmath26  mhz ) .",
    "finer frequency resolution shows the pulse width to be constant ( within the limits of what can be determined for the s / n ) as a function of frequency across the entire @xmath3-mhz band .",
    "the pulse is barely resolved ( if at all ) , as the dispersive smearing time within the @xmath27-mhz frequency channels is @xmath28  ms ( @xmath29  ms and @xmath30  ms ) at the middle ( bottom and top ) of the band . removing this contribution from the observed pulse width",
    "reveals that any intrinsic width , combined with any scatter broadening , amount to no more than @xmath27  ms .",
    "a steep power law , e.g. the kolmogorov scenario with @xmath31 can be ruled out , as can the predicted scatter broadening time of @xmath32  ms from the empirical estimate of @xcite , although the latter is known to be uncertain to at least 2 orders of magnitude . with a measure of s /",
    "n as a function of frequency , we can , with a knowledge of the sensitivity of the instrument , determine the radio spectrum of the pulse .",
    "this results in peak flux densities , for the _ observed _ pulse width , ranging from as low as @xmath33 to as high as @xmath34  mjy across the band , with a slight dip in flux density in the middle of the band ( see figure  [ fig : sweep ] ) . within the error in this estimation ( expected to be at least @xmath35 ) and the limits of the available s / n",
    ", this is consistent with a flat spectrum .",
    "another factor , potentially the dominant source of uncertainty , is the angular and frequency dependence of the telescope gain .",
    "the pulse is unlikely to have been detected along the central axis of the beam corresponding to maximum sensitivity , where the gain is @xmath36  k / jy  @xcite .",
    "the beam responses are well described as gaussian , with half - power - beam - widths ( hpbws ) of @xmath37  arcmin at the central frequency of @xmath4  mhz .",
    "in addition to this angular dependence the hpbw will scale linearly with frequency so that at the top of the band , at @xmath38  mhz , it will be narrower than at the bottom of the band , at @xmath39  mhz , in proportion to the ratio of these frequencies . clearly the spectrum of any incident astrophysical signal will be made steeper by this effect if detected off - axis . @xcite",
    "discuss empirical measurements of this effect where a positive intrinsic spectral index @xmath40 can appear as steep as @xmath41 .",
    "thus there is an extra ( perhaps very large ) uncertainty in the spectrum of the source , and the spectrum is likely to be flatter than observed .",
    "below we take the peak flux density of the pulse ( at the observed pulse width ) to be @xmath1  mjy .",
    "the intrinsic fluence , @xmath42 , of the @xmath2-ms burst is thus : @xmath43 _ distance _ : the distance to the source of the pulse , whatever it may be , is uncertain .",
    "the only available estimate is to invert the relationship between dm and distance : @xmath44 .",
    "this requires a model of the free electron density .",
    "the current best model is ne2001  @xcite which predicts that a maximum of @xmath45 of the dm is contributed by the galaxy , towards the total value of @xmath0 .",
    "the six pulsars within a radius of two degrees of this line of sight have dms of no more than @xmath46 .",
    "to estimate the distance there are two options : ( i ) assume that the ne2001 model is incorrect along this line of sight , so that all of the dm contribution is due to galactic material , and the source is then within our galaxy at a distance of @xmath47  kpc ( this being where the ` galaxy ends ' according to the ne2001 model ) ; ( ii ) take the ne2001 estimate to be correct , in which case the excess dm of @xmath48 would be due to the intergalactic medium and any putative host galaxy for the source . in the second scenario , repeating the analysis of @xcite , an extremely large distance of @xmath49  mpc results .    _ re - observations _ : deciding between these two possibilities is crucial as the implied luminosities , and therefore likely progenitors , depend on it .",
    "motivated by this we performed follow - up observations using the parkes telescope to test the hypothesis that the source is galactic ( i.e. ne2001 is incorrect ) and a pulsar which emits giant pulses ( the most likely galactic solution ) . in this scenario",
    "many more weaker pulses would be expected to be easily detected .",
    "we used analogue filterbanks , the same backend as was used in the original survey  @xcite , with @xmath50-mhz and @xmath51-@xmath52s frequency and time resolution respectively , recording stokes i with 1-bit digitisation .",
    "concurrently we recorded stokes iquv data , with the digital filterbanks with 8-bit digitisation , with the aim of looking more closely at this data , with polarisation information , and with more dynamic range , if a second event was detected in the total intensity data . in @xmath53 hours of follow - up",
    "only two events were detected which were inconsistent with radiometer noise , both of which were clearly due to narrow - band radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "no further pulses from j1852@xmath908 were seen in a total of @xmath54 hours of observation . in the following section",
    "we investigate the implications of this .",
    "_ radio frequency interference _ : the strongest signals detectable by any radio telescope are often of terrestrial origin . in searches for isolated astrophysical bursts",
    "there are several steps we can follow to minimise the effects of rfi . for instance , the zero - dm subtraction technique can be used to remove broadband rfi , using the fact that it will be strongest at a dm of zero  @xcite .",
    "narrow - band rfi can be removed by keeping an account of the bandpass as a function of time and excising anomolously high or variable channels .",
    "furthermore , for pulsar surveys performed at parkes using the 13-beam 21-cm receiver , boresight sources are not expected to appear in more than 4 beams at once .",
    "most astrophysical signals are detected in only one beam , and many rfi signals are detected in several beams , i.e they are detected in the sidelobes of the beams gain patterns , so that a multi - beam coincidence test can be used to discriminate against these undesired signals .",
    "this can take the form of a post - facto comparison of detected events  @xcite or , as has recently been implemented by @xcite , a full cross - correlation of the signals from each beam .",
    "the pulse under consideration here survives all of these checks which leads us to conclude that it is astrophysical in origin . as stated in ",
    "[ sec : pulse ] the pulse follows the theoretical @xmath55 dispersion law without deviation , and is detected in only one beam of the 21-cm receiver .",
    "this clearly contrasts with typical rfi signals , but also with less commonly encountered rfi signals such as the `` peryton '' signals  @xcite .",
    "these signals are detected in most / all beams , but with atypical frequency - dependent delay .",
    "this delay is somewhat quadratic , but with ` kinks ' where @xmath56 .",
    "these authors also noted that the inferred dm for these signals , if one fits for the theoretical quadratic dispersion law , is , in the case of 15 of the 21 perytons reported , within @xmath57 of @xmath58 , the dm for the lb .",
    "other curious characteristics of the peryton signals include that : they all occured in the utc range @xmath59 , have a tendency to appear in the latter @xmath60 of each second , and are separated by gaps of @xmath61 seconds . in the light of the disimilarity between these signals and the burst discussed in this paper",
    "we are confident that the two phenomena are not linked .",
    "furthermore we agree with the conclusion of @xcite that the lb originated from a boresight astrophysical source , as originally concluded by @xcite .",
    "_ pulsar giant pulse _ : pulsar spectra are typically steep : their mean spectral index is @xmath62 , with values steeper than @xmath63 being very uncommon  @xcite . nevertheless , despite the flat spectrum of the pulse , we consider this possibility as , on a pulse - by - pulse basis pulsar spectra can vary dramatically  @xcite , and because the radio - emitting magnetars show flat spectra ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this scenario presupposes that the ne2001 model is sufficiently uncertain , i.e. the free electron content is underestimated by more than 50% along the line of sight to the source .",
    "this is possible ; see e.g. @xcite who showed errors of a factor of two at high galactic latitutes , and @xcite for a comparison with vlbi - derived distances .",
    "the most likely galactic source to consider is that of a ` giant pulse ' ( gp ) from a pulsar at the edge of the galaxy .",
    "gps are sometimes ( arbitrarily ) defined to be those pulses where the pulse ` energy ' ( i.e. the product of the peak flux density and the effective pulse width ) is more than 10 times the mean  @xcite .",
    "there are at least 14 pulsars known to exhibit gps , the most notable being the crab pulsar , which we will use as a template below .",
    "the pulse energy distributions for gps follow power - laws such that the number of gps with energy @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath65 . the measured value of @xmath15 in the most recent analysis of the main pulse gps of the crab is @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "the lowest measured value is @xmath67 for the millisecond pulsar b1937@xmath6821  @xcite and the highest is @xmath69 for the 0.9-s pulsar b0031@xmath907  @xcite .",
    "the detected pulse had a s / n of @xmath16 , whereas we would have been capable of easily detecting pulses at s / ns as low as 5 .",
    "for a gp - emitting pulsar this means that we might have expected @xmath70 weaker pulses ( this is @xmath71 for the crab s @xmath72 ) assuming similar pulse widths , or that the probability we get a pulse @xmath73 in a given ( unknown ) pulse period @xmath74 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total number of periods observed and @xmath77 is the observation time .",
    "thus the probability of not seeing a single weaker pulse for @xmath78 periods in a row is @xmath79 which ( assuming @xmath80 , which it no doubt will be for any reasonable pulsar period ) is just @xmath81 .",
    "this has the ( perhaps counter - intuitive ) implication that the limit on @xmath15 is independent of the duration of the followup , as long as @xmath80 and there are no re - detections .",
    "so , a probability of @xmath82 implies @xmath83 ( such as for the crab ) is ruled out and for a probability of @xmath84 , the range @xmath85 is ruled out .",
    "very flat distributions with @xmath86 are not ruled out .",
    "although the limit on @xmath15 is no better for the @xmath54 hours of followup as compared to the 35-minute pmps observation alone , the limit on the gp rate is much stronger .",
    "the rate per period is @xmath87 , whereas pulses with the same energy ( @xmath88 ) occur with a much higher probability of @xmath89 in the case of the crab s main - pulse gps ( see the top panel of figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we should consider the intrinsic fluence , @xmath90 , for a fair comparison",
    ". taking @xmath91  kpc as the distance to j1852@xmath908 , and recalling that the distance to the crab is @xmath92  kpc , we see that we must consider the rate of pulses with energy @xmath93 which is @xmath94 for the crab .",
    "this is not excluded by our rate limit , however we know @xmath95 , not @xmath66 as for the crab .",
    "also , this implicitly assumes that the gp rate is identical to the crab at an intrinsic fluence of @xmath96 .",
    "if we consider the rates to be identical at an intrinsic fluence @xmath51 times lower and utilise our @xmath15 limit , we get a rate of @xmath97 .",
    "choosing a lower intrinsic energy as a reference point gives an even more constraining limit , although it is unclear where this point should be chosen .",
    "we can see that a long period pulsar with ( say ) @xmath98  s , or one with a gp burst rate @xmath99 times less than the crab , or , equivalently , a source with a high nulling fraction , is not ruled out . in the past 6 years",
    "a number of long - period pulsars have been discovered which might fit these criteria .",
    "the first group are the three radio - emitting magnetars .",
    "these sources show large modulation in single pulse flux density , and flat radio spectra  @xcite . however , unlike the j1852@xmath908 pulse , they are seen to be ` on ' for very long timescales and have been tracked over several years .",
    "the so - called `` rrats '' emit detectable pulses at a rate per period of between @xmath100 .",
    "it is unclear , in most cases , whether or not these sources null , but the lower limit on the ratio of peak to average flux densities can be @xmath101 ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the pulse energy distributions of these sources are not yet well studied , although some seem to show log - normal distributions  @xcite whereas the two sources with power - law distributions show @xmath102 and @xmath27 respectively ( miller et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . with a single pulse it is impossible to pass comment on the likelihood of a log - normal ( or any other @xmath92 parameter ) distribution .",
    "we applied the same analysis to the lb , where 40 hours of followup observation have been reported without a further detection  @xcite . in this case , we rule out @xmath103 with a probability of @xmath104 ( and @xmath105 with a probability of @xmath106 ) , where we have adopted lorimer et al s s / n of @xmath51 .",
    "the limit on the gp rate per period is @xmath107 . in the case of the lb , where the dm in excess of the ne2001 value is so much larger than in the j1852@xmath908 case , and",
    "hence that the distance is apparently @xmath108  kpc , this rate can be easily scaled to @xmath109 . however , using the nominal distance of @xmath110  mpc , the inferred radio luminosity is @xmath111 orders of magnitude brighter than the brightest pulse ever detected from the crab , which seems much too luminous to be due to the same mechanism . for both bursts",
    ", we note that the above calculation of the limit for @xmath15 implicitly assumes a rate of 1 per @xmath77 , whereas the best estimate for the rates , in both cases , can be taken to be @xmath112 per @xmath77  @xcite , with corresponding probability of @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "if the true rate were lower than the nominal rate used , the @xmath15 limit would be less constraining than stated above , whereas if the rate is in fact higher the @xmath15 limit would be even stronger .",
    "_ annihilating black holes _",
    ": one theorised source of ` single event ' radio signals are annihilating mini black holes . evaporating black holes with @xmath115  kg can create electron - positron pairs ( as @xmath116 ) .",
    "if evaporation can only proceed down to a mass @xmath117 , at which point the energy of @xmath118 is released , then pairs with ( initial ) lorentz factors of @xmath119 are created . as first pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "such a `` fireball '' of relativistic pairs , which would have energy @xmath120  j and contain @xmath121 pairs , expanding into the surrounding magnetic field of the interstellar medium , will produce surface currents and a radio burst .",
    "@xcite showed that the pairs will be sufficiently energetic to do this , while avoiding annihilation , in the range @xmath122 , and calculated the energy spectrum of the radio pulse to be : @xmath123 where @xmath124 describes the shape of the spectrum , a power - law with spectral index @xmath125 up to @xmath126 , a critical frequency @xmath71  ghz , above which the spectrum steepens significantly .",
    "substituting in the earlier expression for @xmath127 and parameterising @xmath128 , and @xmath129 this becomes : @xmath130 such a pulse occurs in a single radio frequency cycle ( and so is broadband ) at a frequency of @xmath131  ghz .",
    "the observed pulse width @xmath132 is smeared with respect to the intrinsic width , so that the _ inferred _ ` radio pseudo - luminosity ' of the radio pulse @xmath133 is simply : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , so in our parameterisation we have @xmath136 . but we know that , by definition , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is flux density and @xmath139 is distance .",
    "thus , assuming the burst under consideration here is due to such an annihilating black hole we can infer a distance from the observed @xmath138 , @xmath132 and expected @xmath140 value .",
    "this yields a distance of @xmath141  kpc .",
    "larger values of @xmath142 or the lower sensitivity of an off - axis detection both lower the distance . in theory ,",
    "this estimate for distance in the black hole scenario can be compared with the dm estimate for the distance as a check of consistency .",
    "we again have two scenarios : ( i ) if the ne2001 model is correct then the distance is much too short and inconsistent with the dm distance ; ( ii ) if the ne2001 model is sufficiently incorrect , so that we can attribute essentially all the dispersion to the @xmath143  kpc of galactic material along the line of sight , the scenario is not inconsistent .",
    "in the case of the lb , repeating this analysis we infer a distance of @xmath144  kpc , which is , regardless of whether or not ne2001 is hugely incorrect along that particular line of sight , much too short . thus this scenario is not a consistent explanation for the lb .",
    "_ other solutions _ : in double neutron star systems , one star will be recycled to millisecond periods , whereas the second will have a longer period ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite consider such a binary , on the verge of merging due to the emission of gravitational waves , where the longer period star has a magnetic field of @xmath145  g and a period of @xmath146  s. the millisecond pulsar fuels a flow of plasma in the light cylinder of the long - period pulsar , within which it is completely enclosed , resulting in the loss of orbital and spin energy to a broadband coherent millisecond radio burst .",
    "the flux density detected at earth for such an event , occuring at a distance @xmath139 , is @xmath147 where @xmath148 is an efficiency factor , and @xmath149 is the magnetic field strength of the long period neutron star in units of @xmath150  g. applying this to the pulse under consideration here implies a distance of @xmath151  mpc ( @xmath152  kpc ) for magnetic field strengths of @xmath150  g ( @xmath153  g ) , which is not inconsistent with the observed dispersion , for a sufficiently incorrect ne2001 estimate along this line of sight . in the case of the lb ,",
    "this yields a distance of @xmath154  kpc ( @xmath155  kpc ) , which is too small a distance to be consistent , regardless of the corrrectness of ne2001 for the line of sight .",
    "however , it is highly uncertain as to whether the signal could propagate through the `` plasma shroud '' of the system , and the volumetric merger rate suggests that these events are unlikely to occur at distances @xmath156  mpc  @xcite .",
    "a confirmation would neccessarily require a detection of the gravitational wave counterpart signal , but as both pulses under discussion here occured before the ligo and geo600 detectors came online , no such check is possible .",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered the case of a supernova shell expanding into the magnetic field of the pre - existing star .",
    "the shell `` combs '' the magnetic field into the radial direction , producing a current sheet and an associated coherent radio burst . as for the merger scenario ,",
    "given the expected rates , the distance such events are expected to occur at is @xmath157  mpc .",
    "furthermore , for a volumetric supernova rate of @xmath158  @xcite , the number of supernovae expected in the pmps would be just @xmath159 assuming it would be sensitive out to @xmath110  mpc in all directions , which itself is highly optimistic given the effects of dispersion and scattering on sensitivity .",
    "the predicted allowable pulse energies cover a large range : @xmath160  j , with the 1970s limits just probing the upper end of this range for sources at 100  mpc  @xcite . taking the pulse under consideration here to be due to such an event the implied energy at @xmath51",
    "mpc is @xmath161  j. the same calculation for the lb gives @xmath162  j for the same distance .",
    "the wide ( and therefore unconstraining ) range of allowable energies mean that a distance consistent with the dispersion can easily be found .",
    "given the wide range of lorentz factors possible ( @xmath163 ) , one might also devise a relativistic source to fit the observed distance and flux density , e.g. a precessing jet from a microquasar ( r. spencer , private communication ) .",
    "all of the other known types of radio transient signals can be dismissed due to either their timescales , their lack of dispersion ( as nearby sources ) , or both  @xcite .",
    "the pulse discussed here is consistent with a number of scenarios . it is consistent with a ` giant pulse ' from either a young pulsar with a burst rate perhaps @xmath99 times less than the crab , or a long period pulsar , albeit with quite a steep cumulative pulse energy distribution with @xmath164 , and a flat radio spectrum more like those of the radio - emitting magnetars .",
    "a second scenario involving the radio signal from an annihilating mini black hole is also consistent .",
    "it is interesting that the two possibilities can only apply if the ne2001 model is sufficiently incorrect along the line of sight to the source that all of the dispersion is due to the galaxy .",
    "it is also noteworthy that neither of these two scenarios give a consistent solution for the lb , regardless of ne2001 s precision .",
    "we can use the lack of other detections in the pmps to set an upper limit on @xmath165 , the cosmological density of mini black holes which produce radio bursts ( i.e. primordial black holes within a certain mass range ) . from one event within a ( say ) @xmath91  kpc radius , detected during the pmps , whose duration was",
    "@xmath166  y and field - of - view was @xmath167 , we can extrapolate to obtain a limit of @xmath168 .",
    "although , amongst other things , this assumes that all such black holes produce radio bursts at the end of their lives , the implication is that annihilating black holes are an insignificant contribution to the matter density of the universe .",
    "next we considered radio bursts from ns - ns mergers , which , although the rate is uncertain , can be consistent with an extragalactic source for the pulse , although again not for the lb .",
    "a burst associated with an expanding supernova shell allows solutions for both pulses , although the predicted energy range for the pulse ( which spans 8 orders of magnitude ) means a meaningful comparison with dm - derved distances is not possible .",
    "an important point is that the intrinsic timescale is unknown for the pulses discussed here . in both cases the pulse widths are of the order of , and just slightly larger than , the dispersion smearing time within a single @xmath27-mhz frequency channel . we can not account for any contribution due to scattering in the interverning medium , as our knowledge of this effect along specific lines of sight through the galaxy",
    "is very poor .",
    "however , this could be used to decide between the consistent solutions .",
    "for instance , if there is zero ( or very little ) scattering then we would know that the intrinsic pulse timescale is @xmath131  ms and the annihilating mini black hole ( and supernova ) scenarios would be ruled out .",
    "all we can say is that for the pulsars closest to the line of sight monitored by the lovell telescope it is difficult to decipher scattering from intrinsic profile features , although the recent successful work by @xcite in this area provides cause for optimism .",
    "transient signals detected in the future with lofar , and other next generation wide field - of - view telescopes , where rapid localisation , classification , multi - wavelength followup , and the detection of any associated gravitational wave signal ( e.g. with advanced ligo ) will be possible , lead us to believe that unambiguous identification of the sources of such energetic events will become routine in the ska era .",
