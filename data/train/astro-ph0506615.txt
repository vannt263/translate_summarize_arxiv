    "in a universe where cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominates structure formation , the haloes of galaxies and clusters are assembled via the hierarchical merging and accretion of smaller progenitors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this process causes structures to relax violently to a new equilibrium by redistributing energy among the collisionless mass components .",
    "early stars formed in these progenitors behave as a collisionless system just like the dark matter particles in their host haloes , and they undergo the same dynamical processes during subsequent mergers and the buildup of larger systems like massive galaxies or clusters .",
    "it is of crucial importance in galaxy formation studies to explore the efficiency of the mixing process and see if any spatial or kinematical signatures exist in material that collapses at different epochs and within peaks of the primordial gaussian density field of different rarity .    in this paper",
    ", we use a suite of high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations to analize the distribution and kinematics within present - day galaxy haloes of dark matter particles that originally belonged to selected branches of the merger tree .",
    "these properties are particularly relevant for the baryonic tracers of early cdm structures , e.g. the old stellar halo which may have originated from the disruption at high redshift of numerous dwarf protogalaxies @xcite , the old halo globular clusters , and also giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the end product of the entire merger tree is a triaxial cuspy dark matter halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) : a small fraction of early progenitor systems survive the merging process and end up as dark matter substructures @xcite . since rare , early haloes",
    "are strongly biased towards overdense regions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , i.e. towards the centers of larger scale fluctuations that have not collapsed yet , we might expect that material originating from the earliest branches of the merger tree is today much more centrally concentrated than the overall halo .",
    "indeed , a `` non - linear '' peak biasing has been discussed previously by several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    here",
    "we show that the distribution and kinematics of `` old material '' within present - day galaxy haloes depends primarily on the rareness of the peaks of the primordial density fluctuation field it originally belonged to",
    ". specifically , today s properties of objects that formed in old rare density peaks above @xmath3 [ where @xmath4 is the _ rms _ fluctuation in the density field linearly extrapolated to redshift @xmath5 smoothed with a top - hat filter of mass @xmath6 .",
    "a `` one @xmath7 peak '' corresponds to the characteristic mass `` @xmath8 '' and @xmath9 , depend largely on @xmath10 and not on the particular values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "such centrally concentrated components are isotropic in the inner part , just like the host galaxy haloes , but rapidly become more radially anisotropic further out .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in   2 we describe the numerical simulations and how to define and trace high-@xmath7 particle subsets . in ",
    "3 we analyse the present - day distribution of these subsets .",
    "we derive a simple empirical fitting formula for @xmath11 , the mass density profile of all progenitors above @xmath12 , which approximates the results of our n - body cosmological simulations for @xmath13 .",
    "  4 discusses the implications of our findings for old stellar populations .",
    "we argue that such centrally concentrated components are predicted to be isotropic in the inner part , just like the host galaxy halo , but to rapidly become more radially anisotropic further out .",
    "this is quantitative with the radial velocity dispersion profile of galaxy halo stars from @xcite and with the anisotropic orbits of nearby halo stars ( @xmath14 , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in   5 .",
    "we identify collapsed high-@xmath7 peaks at different epochs within high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations , mark them , and analyse the distribution and kinematics of this material at redshift zero .",
    "details about the simulations and halo finding method are given in the next two subsections .",
    "the simulations have been performed using pkdgrav , a parallel n - body treecode written by stadel and quinn @xcite : cosmological and numerical parameters are the same as in @xcite .",
    "the present - day haloes that we analyse are labeled `` d12 '' ( cluster ) and `` g0 '' to `` g3 '' ( galaxies ) .",

    "first the inertia tensors of the particles within a sphere of a given radius is calculated and diagonalized , then the same is done iteratively for particles within the triaxial shape found in the previous step , until the procedure converges .",
    "note that the shape at a given radius depends on all particles within this radius , but for density profiles less steep than @xmath18 the outer particles dominate over the inner ones in the contribution to the inertia tensor .",
    "the average axis ratios of the four galaxy haloes g0-g3 at the virial radius ( @xmath19 ) are close to the mean values of large samples of haloes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . figure [ avgfofmom ] shows the average shapes of 2 , 3 , and 3.5@xmath7 material at the present epoch .",
    "both axis ratios become smaller for higher-@xmath7 material at all radii.(this is also true for each of the four galaxies individually , not just for the average . )",
    "this result is consistent with the finding of @xcite that the average axis ratios decrease with redshift , although our 2@xmath7 haloes formed at higher redshift and lower virial mass than the range probed by @xcite .",
    "the origin of the extremely prolate shape of the high-@xmath7 subsets ( @xmath20 for the 3.5@xmath7 material ) could be a series of correlated head - on ( i.e. low - angular momentum ) mergers along a filament aligned with the long axis @xcite .",
    "for the total dark matter halo the axis orientations change with radius , as found in @xcite , and a similar behavior is observed for the high-@xmath7 subsets .",
    "the highest @xmath7 subsets show a slightly better alignment which is simply explained with the fact that inner particles dominate the shape calculation due to the very high concentrations of these subsets . between the different subsets the axes are generally well aligned only when they have many particles in common , i.e. in the inner parts .",
    "as the fraction of high-@xmath7 material drops with increasing radius , the alignment with the shape of the whole halo becomes worse .",
    "it is well known that high-@xmath7 peaks at early times are biased towards overdense regions where larger haloes will form later ( see figs . [ 4 ] and [ 200 ] ) . but how large is the mass fraction of such peaks within present - day haloes , and how does this fraction depend on the mass of the @xmath21 parent host ?",
    "do haloes which correspond to higher-@xmath7 peaks today ( like massive clusters ) contain a larger fraction of early high-@xmath7 material ?",
    "this question is not well defined , since the fraction of particles from peaks above 2@xmath7 in a present - day galaxy halo grows when the peaks are selected with a larger mass threshold at lower redshift ( see upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ avg2sig ] ) .",
    "here we use fixed mass threshold / redshift pairs to select progenitors and compare the mass fractions they contribute to parent haloes of different sizes .",
    "the selection of a fixed progenitor mass may be motivated in studies of old stellar populations if , for example : a ) population iii stars form in `` minihaloes '' above a _ molecular cooling mass _ , i.e. massive enough to allow efficient gas cooling via roto - vibrational levels of h@xmath22 , @xmath23^{-3/2}\\,\\msun$ ] ( virial temperatures @xmath24k ) ; and b ) metal - poor halo stars ( population ii ) and globular clusters form in haloes above an _ atomic cooling mass _ , i.e. massive enough to allow efficient gas cooling and fragmentation via excitation of hydrogen ly@xmath25 , @xmath26^{-3/2}\\,\\msun$ ] ( virial temperature @xmath27k ) .    to test",
    "whether , at the present epoch , massive clusters contain a different fraction of high-@xmath7 material than field galaxies , we have used a lower - resolution n - body simulation ( @xmath28 particles in a 90 mpc box , for a resolution of @xmath29 ) in order to obtain a larger galaxy / cluster sample .",
    "we have selected ten parent hosts at @xmath21 with fof masses close to @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , for a total of fourty haloes .",
    "we have then marked fof groups with more than 100 particles at redshifts 7.0 , 4.3 , 3.1 and 0.8 , and determined the fractions of the virial mass of the parent belonging to a fixed progenitor mass / redshift ( @xmath34 ) pair .",
    "the values obtained are given in table [ sigmafr ] : the mass fractions are practically constant for all parents which host any of the selected progenitors .",
    "as we select parents of lower masses , the number of parents hosting rarer ( higher-@xmath7 ) progenitors drops from 10 to 0 within about a decade in mass .",
    "we have shown that the final distribution and kinematics of dark matter particles selected from early branches of the merger tree are systematically different than those of the parent halo as a whole .",
    "these properties are also relevant for old stellar populations if these form predominantly in early low - mass progenitor haloes , as stars behave essentially as collisionless systems just like the dark matter particles in our simulations . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss a number of possible applications .",
    "numerical simulations performed in the context of hierarchical structure formation theories suggest that the first ( population iii ) stars may have formed out of metal - free gas in dark matter minihaloes of mass above @xmath35 ( abel et al .",
    "2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ; yoshida et  al .  2003 ; kuhlen & madau 2005 ) condensing from rare high-@xmath7 peaks of the primordial density fluctuation field at @xmath36 , and were likely very massive . barring any fine tuning of the initial mass function ( imf ) of population iii stars , intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs )  with masses above the 520@xmath37 range of known ` stellar - mass ' holes",
    " may be one of the inevitable endproduct of the first episodes of pregalactic star formation ( madau & rees 2001 ) .",
    "5.5 truein    5.5 truein    where do relic pregalactic imbhs lurk in present - day galaxy halos ? to shed some light on this question , we have populated our 3@xmath7 ( 3.5@xmath7 ) simulated progenitors at @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) with one seed imbh for every @xmath40 solar masses of halo material . as discussed by volonteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , these imbhs will undergo a variety of processes during the hierarchical buildup of larger and larger haloes , like gas accretion , binary hardening , black hole mergers , triple interactions . while we neglect all of these effects here",
    ", our dark matter simulations do correctly model the bias in the formation sites , the accretion into larger haloes , and the competing effects of dynamical friction and tidal striping within larger potential wells , as these complicated dynamical processes are dominated by the dark haloes that host the black holes .",
    "therefore , in our toy model , the distribution of 3 or 3.5@xmath7 material at @xmath21 describes the properties of holes wandering through within today s galaxy haloes .",
    "the predicted imbh number density and mass density profiles are shown as circles in figures [ avg3sig ] and [ avg3.5sig ] : the former may be regarded as an upper limit since we have neglected black hole mergers , while the latter have been estimated assuming that these off - muclear black holes have grown by accretion to a mean mass of @xmath41 , which is a rough estimate obtained from figure 14 of @xcite .",
    "depending on the imf of population iii objects , some first - generation low - mass stars may have survived until today .",
    "their number density profile @xmath42 within the milky way can again be read following the circles in figure [ avg3sig ] , under the assumption that @xmath43 metal - free star survives for every @xmath40 solar masses of 3@xmath7 progenitor halo material at @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy then to scale up the predicted value of @xmath42 if @xmath44 such stars were to survive instead . on average",
    ", we find that about 1/3 of these remnants would lie today in the bulge , i.e. in the inner 3 kpc .",
    "this fraction fluctuates between 24% and 45% in the four galaxies g0-g3 .",
    "the density in the solar neighborhood is of order @xmath45kpc@xmath46 , three orders of magnitude lower than in the bulge .",
    "the number density of remnants would be lower and more concentrated toward the galactic center if population iii stars only formed within rarer 3.5@xmath7 peaks ( fig .",
    "[ avg3.5sig ] ) . on average ,",
    "about 59% of them would now lie within the bulge ( range is 38%-84% ) and the local number density would be only @xmath47kpc@xmath46 . even for @xmath48 , this is an extremely small value , many orders of magnitude below the local number density of halo stars . _",
    "the above results suggest that the very oldest stars and their remnants should be best searched for within the milky way bulge .",
    "_    5.5 truein      material from @xmath49 peaks has today a density profile that is very similar to the stellar halo around the milky way @xcite .",
    "it contributes a few percent of the total virial mass , and therefore contains enough baryons to build up a @xmath50 stellar halo with a reasonable star formation efficiency .",
    "the assumption of a common pregalactic origin between such a stellar component and the surviving local group dwarf galaxies provides an additional constraint and allows us to determine the progenitor mass threshold / redshift pair which best fit the data . from this argument",
    "@xcite identified hosts above @xmath51 at @xmath52 as the progenitor haloes which the bulk of halo stars originally belonged to .    to check whether this simple model reproduces the kinematics as well as the radial distribution of halo stars , we have compared the predicted radial velocity dispersion profile with recent data from @xcite ( see fig . [ mwhalo ] ) .",
    "all haloes were rescaled ( i.e. @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) to produce a local circular velocity of 220 km / s after taking into account the increase in circular velocity due to baryonic contraction [ @xmath56 found by @xcite for our halo g1 .",
    "the rescaled virial masses are given in figure [ mwhalo ] .",
    "the predicted @xmath57 are close to the observed ones , especially for halo g0 and g4 .",
    "our model predicts a radial anisotropy that grows with radius ( see lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ mwhalo ] ) : in the solar neighborhood it gives @xmath58 and @xmath59 , in good agreement with the observed values @xcite .",
    "the declining velocity dispersion near the center is characteristic of haloes containing _ only _ dark matter . in the galaxy",
    "we expect a flatter profile in the inner , baryon - dominated regions .    both a high concentration ( @xmath60 ) , highly anisotropic halo like g4 and a @xmath61 halo with smaller anisotropy like g0 fit the data equally well .",
    "a detailed comparison requires knowledge of the tangential components of the velocity dispersion , in order to determine the concentration and virial mass of the milky way halo .",
    "the recently discovered stellar halo of m31 has a similar density profile than that of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion observed in m31 is mostly due to tangential motions : preliminary results yield a constant @xmath62 of about 80 km / s for @xmath63 kpc @xcite , close to the value expected for the g0 scenario but much higher than that of the g4 model .",
    "more data for m31 will hopefully soon become available , and many radial velocities of milky way halo stars will be obtained by surveys like rave and sdss - ii . in the next decade",
    "the planned gaia satellite will provide very detailed phase - space positions .",
    "another interesting feature of our model is that it predicts significant deviations from the simple radial velocity dispersion profiles expected for a smooth stellar halo in an nfw potential ( like the models in @xcite , fig .",
    "4 ) . these deviations are evident in the upper right panel of figure [ mwhalo ] ( but not in the lower left panel where we show an average over four haloes ) .",
    "profiles . in haloes resolved with more particles like g0-g3 and d12 , the ` stellar ' radial velocity dispersions are clearly inconsistent with smooth profiles . ]",
    "the fluctuations are not an artifact of our analysis : with our usual choice of 30 logarithmic spherical bins out to the virial radius [ similar to the binning of the observed @xmath57 ] the fluctuations often extend over various bins with each bin containing thousands of ` stars ' . to show fluctuations of @xmath57 on smaller scales we have binned ` stars ' in halo g0 using linear spherical bins , and have ploted the resulting @xmath57 profile in the same radial range of the observations ( circles with error bars in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ mwhalo ] ) .",
    "the linear bins contain at least 108 stars , the error bars represent poisson noise .",
    "we have also plotted @xmath65 of halo g0 twice using different bin sizes .",
    "note that the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo as a whole ( instead of the material belonging to the @xmath49 @xmath52 subset ) in our simulated galaxies is generally a smooth function of radius , with small deviations becoming apparent only at @xmath66 kpc . as fluctuations in the stellar @xmath57",
    "are not caused by mass bound to subhaloes ( the mass fraction is much too small particularly within the inner halo ) , this leaves tidal streams as the most probable cause of such deviations .",
    "the entire dark halo is assembled from about @xmath67 resolved progenitors , the tidal debris of which are well mixed and smooth . in our model , the stellar halo is made up instead from only a few hundred building blocks ( and a significant fraction of it comes from the most massive ones ) , and is therefore expected to show some granularity . a more detailed study of tidal features in our model stellar haloes is left to a future paper .      during the completion of this work two related models for the formation of the stellar halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ) came to our attention . both studies are more detailed than our in the sense that they try to model the effect of star formation and chemical evolution . @xcite",
    "use a semi - analytic approach combined with n - body simulations of satellite disruption in an external , growing galaxy potential .",
    "like in this work the number of luminous satellites and the mass of the final stellar halo is adjusted to match the observations by assuming that reionisation suppresses star formation in later - forming small progenitors .",
    "our stellar haloes , however , seem to be more concentrated than those of @xcite . this may due to the fact that we only trace old stellar populations , while @xcite also allow for more recent episodes of star formation in their protogalactic building blocks .",
    "they also model the disruption of satellites assuming an external spherical potential : this is probably a good approximation to recent accretion events which build up the outer stellar halo .",
    "the inner stellar halo , however , is built up through a series of early , major mergers : these cause rapid potential fluctuations ( violent relaxation ) which are not accounted for in the spherical potential approximation .",
    "this limitation was also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the cosmological sph simulations of @xcite , while not including any global mechanism for suppressing star formation in later - forming small progenitors , do lead to similar stellar halo profiles and kinematics as our model . they seem to produce , however , far too many halo stars : recent sph simulations at higher resolution and without strong feedback effects also overpredict the number of satellites by a large factor @xcite and tend to produce even more halo stars .",
    "the similarity of the profile shape and kinematics of stellar haloes in all these models suggests that they are a robust and generic outcome of hierarchical structure formation ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) and do not depend on the detailed formation history .",
    "note that this does not contradict our argument about the possibility to use the radial extent of collisionless tracer populations to learn about their formation epoch and sites .",
    "it just illustrates how this arguments is limited to fossil records from very high redshift ( @xmath68 , see also   [ region ] ) . at lower redshifts",
    "the typical haloes are larger and the exact star formation sites must be taken into account .",
    "efficient cooling ( and/or numerical losses of gas angular momentum to the dark matter in under - resolved progenitors ) can produce a population of stars at some intermediate redshift with a distribution that is similar to much older populations from early high-@xmath7 peaks .",
    "by @xmath21 the two subsets would have very similar concentrations and kinematics , which might explain the similar results found here and in @xcite .",
    "the clustering properties of metal - poor globular clusters contain clues on their formation sites and the epoch when star formation was suppressed by feedback processes ( e.g. reionisation , supernova - driven winds ) in low - mass haloes . in the milky way metal - poor globular clusters follow the same radial profile as halo stars , suggesting within the framework of our model a common origin within early 2.5@xmath7 peak progenitors at @xmath69 .",
    "observations of the distribution of globular clusters within present - day haloes of different masses could provide information on feedback effects as a function of environment @xcite .",
    "the suppression of globular cluster formation at some early epoch may also explain the bimodality observed in cluster metallicities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the widely used assumption that globular cluster formation is a fair tracer of star formation , combined with the suppression of the formation of metal - poor globulars after reionisation , imply that the amount of high-@xmath7 material in a halo is proportional to the number of metal - poor globular clusters . from the results in ",
    "[ fraction ] it follows then that a simple universal reionisation epoch would lead to a constant abundance of metal - poor globular clusters per virial mass .",
    "deviations from this simplest case may provide information about the local reionisation epoch , and whether regions with more ( less ) metal - poor globulars per virial mass were reionised later ( earlier ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the projected luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies follow the r@xmath70 law and resemble rescaled versions of projected cdm halo density profiles ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , similar to the @xmath21 profiles of our high-@xmath7 subsets .",
    "ordinary elliptical galaxies may form by multiple mergers or by the major merger of two disk galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "early formation ( @xmath71 ) in a large number of progenitors followed by a series of gas - poor , essentially collisionless mergers could build up the giant ellipticals ( cd ) in the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "these mergers might undo some of the early dissipational contraction of the total mass distribution @xcite .",
    "5.5 truein    5.5 truein    figure [ allsig ] shows the distribution of material belonging to different @xmath7 peaks in a @xmath21 cluster halo .",
    "the inner cluster regions are entirely made up of material from @xmath72 peaks , and this selection contributes about 10% to the cluster virial mass .",
    "the central brightest galaxies in sdss clusters have an average effective radius of @xmath73kpc and presumably about 10% of the clusters luminosity @xcite .",
    "our @xmath74 subsets contain enough mass to account for the observed cd luminosities but they are more extended .",
    "if the cd stars formed early in the inner parts of all progenitor haloes above 2@xmath7 then they would be found closer to the cluster center today ( see section [ region ] ) .",
    "a simple way to select the inner parts of 2@xmath7 progenitors is to mark higher-@xmath7 peaks at earlier epochs .",
    "our 3@xmath7 selections have a realistic effective radius of about @xmath75 kpc .",
    "therefore we predict the kinematics of the average brightest cluster galaxies to follow the 3@xmath7 selections shown in figure ( [ allsig ] ) if ( or where ) the real cluster potentials are similar to the uncontracted potentials formed in dissipationless cosmological simulations ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "the anisotropy of a @xmath21 subset depends mostly on its density profile shape ( or @xmath10 ) and not on the selection redshift or the number of mergers it has undergone ( figures [ avg1sig ] to [ avg3.5sig ] ) a few mergers are enough to establish the general @xmath76 profile ( [ bemp ] ) and the slope ",

    "their average anisotropy at the half mass radius of the old stellar component is @xmath78 , which is lower than our average of @xmath79 , but considering the very different initial conditions of the stars and the larger numbers of mergers in our cosmological context the results are surprisingly similar .",
    "therefore we argue that our collisionless results are relevant both for giant elliptical galaxies which formed in a series of dissipation - less mergers @xcite and also for the old stars in smaller ellipticals .",
    "the general relation between density pofile slope and anisotropy for high sigma subsets @xmath80 can be applied to elliptical galaxies to infer @xmath76 from the observed stellar profile .",

    "for example , the @xmath21 density , shape , anisotropy , and velocity dispersion profiles of material originating from early 3@xmath7 peaks is independent of the redshift / minimum mass pair used to select it .",

    "<S> in present - day haloes , material from the rarer early peaks is more centrally concentrated and falls off more steeply with radius compared to the overall mass distribution , it has a lower velocity dispersion , moves on more radial orbits , and has a more elongated shape . </S>",
    "<S> population ii stars that formed within protogalactic haloes collapsing from @xmath1 fluctuations would follow today a @xmath2 density profile with a half - light radius of 17 kpc and a velocity anisotropy that increases from isotropic in the inner regions to nearly radial at the halo edge . </S>",
