    "it is widely known that gcs are a useful tool for studying the origin and evolution of galaxies , in the case of isolated galaxies as well as for those within groups or clusters .    in our first wide - field ccd study of the gcs around ngc1399",
    ", at the centre of the fornax cluster @xcite , we found that there are gcs out to the very limits of the studied field ( field 3 in fig .  1 ) , corresponding to a projected galactocentric distance of 100kpc . in a later run",
    ", we obtained images of three adjoining fields , using the same observational set up , which is described in sect .  2 .",
    "we added one field to the west ( field 4 in fig .",
    "1 ) and two fields to the east of ngc1399 ( fields 1 and 2 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "as there were several low - luminosity early - type galaxies with their own gcss in the western field ( ngc1374 , ngc1379 and ngc1387 ) , we decided to keep this field to study them @xcite , and we used the eastern fields , where there were no conspicuous galaxies , to study the ngc1399 gcs over a larger field @xcite .",
    "the observations were performed with the mosaic camera and 4m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter  american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the mosaic wide - field camera has a field of view of 36 @xmath2 36arcmin ( 200 @xmath2 200kpc at the fornax distance ) . for more information on the mosaic camera",
    "we refer to the homepage _ http://www.noao.edu / kpno / mosaic / mosaic.html_.    kron  cousins @xmath1 and washington @xmath0 filters were used .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath1 and washington @xmath3 magnitudes are very similar , with a very small colour term and zero - point difference @xcite . for more details on the point source selection , photometric calibration , and the identification of gc candidates",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "statistical subtraction of the contamination by the background was performed in all cases .",
    "it is shown , for the first time , that the colour distributions of these three low - luminosity galaxies are clearly bimodal , with very similar colours for the blue gc peaks @xcite .",
    "the red peak in ngc1387 , the galaxy located closer to ngc1399 ( see fig .  1 ) , is redder than the others and its whole colour distribution is atypical : the red clusters are much more numerous than the blue ones and the separation of the peaks is very pronounced .",
    "in fact , the fraction of blue clusters , with respect to the total gc population is low for the three systems , but even lower for ngc1387 ( 43% , 45% , and 24% for ngc1374 , ngc1379 and ngc1387 , respectively ) .    with regard to the radial distributions ,",
    "the blue gcs in these systems show flatter distributions than the red ones , while the respective galaxy light profiles follow the density profiles for all gcs .    by means of the luminosity functions we estimate the total gc populations in ngc1374 , ngc1379 and ngc1387 between 200 and 400 clusters , and obtain specific frequencies @xmath4 = 2.4 , 1.4 and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "these specific frequencies are rather small when compared to the typical value @xmath4  =  4 found for elliptical galaxies in dense environments @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows the specific frequencies and fractions of blue clusters versus distance from ngc1399 , including the data for ngc1404 @xcite and ngc1427 @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the specific frequencies seem to decrease with decreasing distance from ngc1399 and a similar trend is present in the fraction of blue clusters .",
    "these behaviours support the idea that galaxies closer to ngc1399 , in projected distance , might be losing their blue gcs as a result of some interaction process , like tidal stripping of clusters by the giant elliptical ngc1399 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "the large - scale study of the projected radial distribution of gcs around ngc1399 @xcite shows that the blue clusters extend up to 250kpc from the galaxy centre ( 45 @xmath5 5arcmin ) while the red ones show a steeper radial profile that reaches a radius of 140kpc ( 25 @xmath5 5arcmin ) . to our knowledge , this is one of the largest gcss ever studied and , as our limiting magnitude is @xmath6 , we can not assure that there are no more gcs further out .",
    "the colour distributions at different radial ranges confirm that the red gcs are more centrally concentrated than the blue ones , and show that the blue peak gets bluer with increasing galactocentric radius ; a similar gradient was found in the ngc1427 gcs by @xcite .",
    "the colour distributions in different magnitude ranges show that the distribution is unimodal for the brightest bin ( magnitudes similar to that of @xmath7cent ) , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , we found no evidence for a  blue tilt \" ( e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. the blue peak does not get redder with increasing luminosity .    the azimuthal distribution of the smoothed projected number density of blue clusters around ngc1399 ( fig .  9 in @xcite ) shows two tails : one towards ngc1404 and another towards ngc1387 . in the case of ngc1404",
    "one might wonder if this is just an overlapping of the two gcss but it has been proposed , and tested by numerical simulations @xcite , that its gcs are probably being stripped by ngc1399 .",
    "the other tail , towards ngc1387 can not be just an overlapping of gcss due to the small size of the gcs of ngc1387 ( r = 3arcmin @xcite ) as compared to the projected distance to ngc1399 ( 19arcmin ) .",
    "such overdensity of blue gcs may be understood as evidence that blue clusters , the less bound ones , are being lost by ngc1387 due to some interaction process with the central cluster galaxy , like tidal stripping .",
