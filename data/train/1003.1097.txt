    "crystallographic methods of structure solution are the gold - standard for determining atomic arrangements in crystals including , in the absence of single crystals , structure solution from powder diffraction data  @xcite . here",
    "we show that crystal structure solution is also possible from experimentally determined atomic pair distribution functions ( pdf ) using the liga algorithm that was developed for nanostructure determination  @xcite .",
    "the pdf is the fourier transform of the properly normalized intensity data from an isotropically scattering sample such as a glass or a crystalline powder .",
    "it is increasingly used as a powerful way to study atomic structure in nanostructured materials  @xcite .",
    "such nanostructures do not scatter with well defined bragg peaks and are not amenable to crystallographic analysis  @xcite , but refinements of models to pdf data yield quantitatively reliable structural information  @xcite . recently _ ab initio _ structure solution was demonstrated from pdf data of small elemental clusters  @xcite .",
    "here we show that these methods can be extended to solve the structure of a range of crystalline materials .    whilst it is unlikely that this kind of structure solution will replace crystallographic methods for well ordered crystals , this work demonstrates both that structure solution from pdf data can be extended to compounds , and that robust structure solutions are possible from the experimentally determined pdfs of a wide range of materials .",
    "we also note that there may be an application for this approach when the space - group of the crystal is not known , as the liga algorithm does not make use of such symmetry information .",
    "in fact , the space group can be determined afterwards analyzing the symmetry of the solved electron density map @xcite . however , this approach is promising for the case where the local structure deviates from the average crystallographic structure , as has been observed in a number of complex crystals , for example the magnetoresistive la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 system  @xcite or ferroelectric lead - based perovskites  @xcite .",
    "the pdf contains this local information due to the inclusion of diffuse scattering intensities in the fourier transform and it is possible to focus the modeling on a specific length - scale when searching for matching structure models , allowing in principle structure solutions of local , intermediate , and long - range order to be obtained separately .",
    "the procedure assumes a periodic system with known lattice parameters and stoichiometry , otherwise there is no information on location or symmetry of the atom sites in the unit cell . to solve the unit cell structure the technique constructs a series of trial clusters using the pdf - extracted distances .",
    "the tested structures are created with a direct use of distance information in the experimental data giving it significantly better performance than procedures that search by random structure updates such as monte carlo based minimization schemes  @xcite .",
    "the extended liga procedure has been tested with experimental x - ray pdfs collected from inorganic test materials .",
    "powder samples of ag , batio@xmath3 , c - graphite , catio@xmath2 , cdse , ceo@xmath4 , nacl , ni , pbs , pbte , si , srtio@xmath2 , tio@xmath4 ( rutile ) , zn , zns ( sphalerite ) and zns ( wurtzite ) were obtained from commercial suppliers .",
    "samples were ground in agate mortar to decrease their crystallite size and improve powder averaging .",
    "the experimental pdfs were measured using synchrotron x - ray diffraction at the 6id - d beamline of the advanced photon source , argonne national laboratory using the x - ray energies of 87 and 98  kev .",
    "the samples were mounted using a thin kapton tape in a circular , 10  mm hole of a 1  mm thick flat plate holder , which was positioned in transmission geometry with respect to the beam .",
    "the x - ray data were measured using the `` rapid acquisition '' ( ra - pdf ) setup , where the diffracted intensities were scanned by a mar345 image plate detector , placed about 20  cm behind the sample  @xcite .",
    "all measurements were performed at room temperature .",
    "the raw detector images were integrated using the fit2d program @xcite to reduce them to a standard intensity vs.  @xmath5 powder data .",
    "the integrated data were then converted by the pdfgetx2 program  @xcite to experimental pdfs . the conversion to pdf",
    "was conducted with corrections for compton scattering , polarization and fluorescence effect , as available in the pdfgetx2 program .",
    "the maximum value of the scattering wavevector @xmath6 ranged from 19  @xmath7 to 29  @xmath7 , based on a visual inspection of the noise in the @xmath8 $ ] curves .",
    "the pdf function @xmath9 was obtained by a fourier transformation of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and provided a scaled measure of finding a pair of atoms separated by distance @xmath12 @xmath13 the @xmath9 function has a convenient property that its peak amplitudes and standard deviations remain essentially constant with @xmath12 and is thus suitable for curve fitting .",
    "a detailed discussions of the pdf theory , data acquisition and applications for structure analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the structure solution procedure was carried out in three separate steps , as described in the sections below .",
    "the first step consists of peak search and profile fitting in the experimental pdf to identify prominent inter - atomic distances up to a cutoff distance @xmath14 .",
    "we have developed an automated peak extraction method which eases this task . in the second step these distances",
    "are used as inputs for the liga algorithm , which searches for unit cell positions that give structure with the best match in pair lengths .",
    "if the sample has several chemical species , a final `` coloring '' step is necessary to assign proper atom species to the unit cell sites .",
    "this can be done by making use of pdf peak amplitude information .",
    "however , we have found that coloring can be also solved by optimizing the overlap of the empirical atom radii at the neighboring sites , which is simpler to implement and works with greater reliability .    to verify the quality and uniqueness of the structure",
    ", the liga algorithm has been run for each sample multiple ( at least 10 ) times with the same inputs , but different seeds of the random number generator . for most samples",
    "the resulting structures were all equivalent , but sometimes the program gave several geometries with similar agreement to the pdf - extracted pair distances .",
    "in all these cases the correct structure could be resolved in the coloring step , where it displayed significantly lower atom radii overlap and converged to known structure solution",
    ". a small number of structures would not solve by this process and the reasons for failure are discussed below .      in the pdf frequent pair distances generate sharp peaks in the measured @xmath9 curve with amplitudes following equation  ( [ eq;grassum ] ) .",
    "the peaks are broadened to approximately gaussian shape that reflects atom thermal vibrations and limited experimental resolution .",
    "additional broadening and oscillations are introduced to the pdf due to the maximum wavevector @xmath6 that can be achieved in the measurement .",
    "this cutoff in @xmath6 in effect convolutes ideal peak profiles with a sinc function @xmath15 thus creating satellite termination ripples .",
    "recovering the underlying peaks from the pdf is not trivial .",
    "the experimental curve can have false peaks due to termination ripples .",
    "nearby peaks can overlap and produce complicated profiles that are difficult to decompose . to simplify the process of extracting inter - atomic distances we have developed an automated method for peak fitting that adds peak profiles to fit the data to some user - defined tolerance , while using as few peaks as possible to avoid over - fitting .",
    "this method grows peak - like clusters of data points while fitting one or more model peaks to each cluster .",
    "adjacent clusters iteratively combine until there is a single cluster with a model that fits the entire data set .",
    "this allows a steady growth in model complexity by progressively refining earlier and less accurate models .",
    "furthermore , most adjustable parameters can be estimated , in principle , from experimental knowns .",
    "a full description of the peak extraction method will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the present work uses the simplest model for peaks , fitting the @xmath9 data with gaussian peaks over @xmath12 and using an assumed value of @xmath16 .",
    "this model ignores the effect of termination ripples , but for our data the spurious peaks due to these ripples were usually identifiable by their small size .",
    "furthermore , the liga algorithm is not required to use every distance it is given , and should exhibit a limited tolerance of faulty distances .",
    "the peak fitting procedure returns positions , widths and integrated areas of the extracted peaks , of which only the peak positions were used for structure determination .",
    "the peak extraction procedure was implemented in mathematica 6 and tested on both the experimental and simulated data .",
    "a typical runtime was about 5 minutes .",
    "since the structures are known we can compare the results of the peak extraction with the expected results .",
    "for both experimental and simulated pdfs of the tested structures these compared qualitatively well to the ideal distances up to @xmath1710 - 15   , including accurate identification of some obscured peaks .",
    "past that range the number of distinct , but very close , distances in the actual structure is so great that reliable peak extraction is much more difficult . for this reason we only performed peak extraction up to 10   before running the trials described in section  [ results ] .",
    "apart from removing peaks below a noise threshold in order to filter termination ripples out , and one difficult peak in the graphite data , all distances used in the structure solution trials below come directly from the peak extraction method .      in the second step the liga algorithm searches for the atom positions in the unit cell that make the best agreement to the extracted pair distances .",
    "the quality of distance match is expressed by cost @xmath18 defined as a mean square difference between observed and modeled pair distances .",
    "@xmath19 the index @xmath20 goes over all pair distances @xmath21 in the model that are shorter than the cutoff length @xmath14 and compares them with the nearest observed distance @xmath22 , while @xmath23 is the number of model distances .",
    "this cost definition considers only distance values as extracted from the pdf peak positions , and ignores their relative occurrences . for multi - component systems",
    "there is in fact no straightforward way of extracting distance multiplicities , because it is not known what atom pairs are present in each pdf peak .",
    "nevertheless , the cost definition still imposes strict requirements on the model structure , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2dlattice ] .",
    "a site in the unit cell must be at a good , matching distance not only from all other cell sites , but also from all of their translational images within the cutoff radius .    .",
    "to achieve low @xmath18 a unit cell site needs to be at a correct distance from other cell sites and from their translational images .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig2dlattice ]    to find an optimum atom position in the unit cell structure the liga algorithm uses input pair distances in an iterative build - up and disassembly of partial structures  @xcite .",
    "the procedure maintains a pool of partial unit cell structures at each possible size from a single atom up to a complete unit cell .",
    "these `` candidate clusters '' are assigned to `` divisions '' according to the number of sites they contain , therefore there are as many divisions as is the number of atoms in a complete unit cell .",
    "the structures at each division compete against each other in a stochastic process , where the probability of winning equals the reciprocal distance cost @xmath18 , and a win is thus more likely for low - cost structures .",
    "the winning cluster is selected for `` promotion , '' where it adds one or more atoms to the structure and thus advances to a higher division . at the new division a poorly performing high - cost candidate",
    "is `` relegated '' to the original division of the promoted structure , thus keeping the total number of structures at each division constant .",
    "the relegation is accomplished by removing cell sites that have the largest contributions to the total cost of the structure .",
    "both promotion and relegation steps are followed by downhill relaxation of the worst site , i.e. , the site with the largest share of the total cost @xmath18 . the process of promotion and relegation is performed at every division in a `` season '' of competitions .",
    "these seasons are repeated many times until a full sized structure attains sufficiently low cost or until a user - specified time limit .",
    "a complete description of the liga algorithm details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the liga algorithm used in the structure solution step has no notion of chemical species and therefore returns only coordinates of the atom sites in the unit cell . for a multi - component system an additional step ,",
    "dubbed coloring , is necessary to assign chemical elements over known cell sites . to assess the quality of different assignments we have tested two definitions for a cost of a particular coloring .",
    "the first method uses a weighted residuum , @xmath24 , from a least - squares pdf refinement to the input pdf data  @xcite .",
    "the pdf refinement was performed with a fully automated pdffit2 script , where the atom positions were all fixed and only the atomic displacement factors , pdf scale factor and @xmath25-resolution damping factor were allowed to vary .",
    "the second procedure defines coloring cost @xmath26 as an average overlap of the empirical atomic radii , so that @xmath27 the index @xmath20 runs over all atom pairs considering periodic boundary conditions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the empirical radii values of the first and second atom in the pair @xmath20 , and @xmath30 is the number of atoms in the unit cell .",
    "considering an @xmath30 atom structure with @xmath31 different atom species , the total number of possible assignments is given by the multinomial expression @xmath32 .",
    "for a 1:1 binary system the number of possible assignments tends to @xmath33 with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "such exponential growth in possible configurations makes it quickly impossible to compare them all in an exhaustive way .",
    "we have therefore employed a simple downhill search , which starts with a random element assignment .",
    "the initial coloring cost @xmath26 is calculated together with a cost change for every possible swap of two atoms between unit cell sites .",
    "the site flip that results in the largest decrease of the total coloring cost is accepted and all cost differences are evaluated again . the site swap is then repeated until a minimum configuration is achieved , where all site flips increase the coloring cost .",
    "the downhill procedure was verified by repeating it 5 times using different initial assignments . in nearly all cases these runs converged to the same atom configurations .",
    "the downhill procedure was performed using both definitions of the coloring cost . for the coloring cost obtained by pdf fitting",
    "the procedure was an order of magnitude slower and less reliable , as the underlying pdf refinements could converge badly for poor atom assignments .",
    "the second method , which calculated cost from radii - overlap , was considerably faster and more robust .",
    "for all tested materials , the overlap - based coloring assigned all atoms correctly , when run on correct structure geometry .",
    "the overlap cost was evaluated using either the covalent radii by  @xcite or the ionic radii from  @xcite for more ionic compounds .",
    "for some ions the shannon table provides several radii values depending on their coordination number or spin state .",
    "although these variants in ionic radii can vary by as much as about 30% , the choice of particular radius had no effect on the best assignment for all studied structures .",
    "the experimental x - ray pdfs were acquired from 16 test samples with well known crystal structures . to verify that the measured pdf data were consistent with established structure results structure refinements of the known structures",
    "were carried out using the pdfgui program  @xcite .",
    "the pdf fits were done with structure data obtained from the crystallography open database ( cod )  @xcite .",
    "the structure parameters were all kept constant in the refinements , which modified only parameters related to the pdf extraction , such as pdf scale , @xmath25 resolution dampening envelope and a small rescaling of the lattice parameters .",
    "these refinements are summarized in table  [ tab;pdfrefinements ] , where low values of the fitting residual @xmath24 confirm good agreement between experimental pdfs and expected structure results .",
    "the pdf datasets were then subjected to the peak search , liga structure solution and coloring procedures as described above . to check the stability of this method , several structures were solved using an enlarged periodicity of 1@xmath341@xmath342 , 1@xmath342@xmath342 or 2@xmath342@xmath342 super cells .",
    "the lattice parameters used in the liga crystallography step were obtained from the positions of the nearest pdf peaks . in several cases , such as for batio@xmath3 where peak search could not resolve tetragonal splitting ,",
    "the cell parameters were taken from the respective cif reference , as listed in table  [ tab;pdfrefinements ] .",
    "the structure solution was considered successful if the found structure displayed the same nearest neighbor coordination as its cif reference and no site was offset by more than 0.3   from its correct position .",
    "the solution accuracy was evaluated by finding the best overlay of the found structure to the reference cif data .",
    "the optimum overlay was obtained by an exhaustive search over all symmetry operations defined in the cif file and over all mappings of solved atom sites to all reference sites containing the same element .",
    "the overlaid structures were then compared for the differences in fractional coordinates and for the root mean square distortion @xmath35 of the solved sites from their correct positions .",

    "such results were caused by a poor quality of the extracted distances , which contained significant errors and omissions with respect to an ideal distance list .",

    "such a cost definition would steer the liga algorithm away from faulty structures found for catio@xmath2 and tio@xmath4 rutile , because both of them had huge atom overlaps @xmath26 .",
    "another improvement is to perform pdf refinement for a full sized structure and update its cost formula so that the pdf fit residuum @xmath24 is used instead of distance cost @xmath18 .",
    "such modification would prevent the cost advantage for wrong structures due to errors and omissions in the extracted distances .",
    "the assumption is that the distance data are still good enough to let the liga algorithm construct the correct structure in one of its many trials .",
    "finally , the cost definition for partial structures can be enhanced with other structural criteria such as bond valence sums ( bvs ) agreement  @xcite .",
    "bond valence sums are not well determined for incomplete intermediate structures and thus can not fully match their expected values .",
    "however , bvs are always increasing , therefore a bvs of some ion that is significantly larger than its expected value is a clear sign of such a partial structure s poor quality .",
    "we have demonstrated the liga algorithm for structure determination from pdf can be extended from its original scope of single - element non - periodic molecules  @xcite to multi - component crystalline systems .",
    "the procedure assumes known lattice parameters and it solves structure geometry by optimizing pair distances to match the pdf extracted values , while the chemical assignment is obtained from minimization of the atomic radii overlap .",
    "the procedure was tested on x - ray pdf data from 16 test samples , of which in 14 cases it gave the correct structure solution .",
    "these are promising results , considering the technique is at a prototype stage and will be further developed to improve its ease of use and rate of convergence . the procedure can be easily amended by a final pdf refinement step .",
    "such an implementation could significantly reduce the overhead in pdf analysis of crystalline materials , because its most difficult step , a design of suitable structure model , would become fully automated .",
