    "recently @xcite studied the mid- and far - infrared emission from an evolving stellar population formed as a burst with a salpeter imf .",
    "infrared emission at @xmath7 m arises from warm dust in the stellar winds of evolved giant stars ; emission at shorter wavelengths @xmath8 m can be largely photospheric @xcite .",
    "most of the time variation of mid - infrared emission from an evolving stellar population results from the declining rate of stellar mass loss from red giants , but @xcite include many additional details .",
    "the mid - infrared emission is far less sensitive to stellar metallicity than age .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility that the mean stellar ages in elliptical galaxies can be determined directly from mid - infrared observations .",
    "we explore this possibility here using archival iso observations at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "the mean ages of stars in elliptical galaxies can be estimated optically from the strength of the stellar balmer lines ( e.g. gonzalez 1993 , worthey 1994 , tantalo et al .",
    "1998 , trager et al .",
    "2000 , kuntschner et al .",
    "these mean age determinations , accurate to 20 - 30 percent , are often interpreted by comparing optical spectra with computed time - dependent spectral energy distributions a single burst of star formation .",
    "most of the stars in elliptical galaxies are thought to be very old , possibly @xmath9 gyrs , but unexpectedly young ages have been found for many ellipticals ( e.g. @xmath2 gyrs ) . evidently the mean stellar age has been skewed downward by the addition of a relatively small component of young stars that may result from a recent merger or internal star formation .",
    "using archival iso data at 15@xmath0 m for 17 early - type galaxies , mostly ellipticals , we explore the possibility that warm circumstellar dust can be used to determine stellar age or the likelihood of a recent merger .",
    "balmer line stellar ages are known for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "we begin by verifying that the surface brightness profiles at 15@xmath0 m are similar to those in the i - band which we assume to be stellar , unaffected by dust emission .",
    "since optically obscuring dust is often observed in the cores of elliptical galaxies , including some in our sample , we used both the integrated ( within @xmath5 ) flux ratio @xmath4 and the surface brightness ratio @xmath1 at a larger radius ( @xmath10 ) as a measure of the mean stellar ages .",
    "the two methods give similar results .",
    "in fact we find that the flux ratio @xmath4 within @xmath5 is similar to the ratios @xmath1 at @xmath10 for all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "apparently , optically obscuring dust in the galactic cores  which could in principle contribute to the emission at 15@xmath0 m  can not be easily detected at the sensitivity and resolution of iso .",
    "as we show below , a plot of @xmath4 against optically determined ages shows that the mid - infrared emission is indeed sensitive to stellar age provided the galaxies are no older than @xmath11 gyrs .",
    "abnormally large @xmath4 or @xmath1 ratios , suggesting the presence of younger stars , are found in elliptical galaxies that ( 1 ) are thought to have suffered a recent merger ( 2 ) have strong optically obscuring dust , or ( 3 ) have hi or non - thermal radio emission .",
    "the infrared camera isocam on board the iso satellite ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) observed about 60 elliptical galaxies in the 4 - 15@xmath0 m region with narrow and wide band filters .",
    "> from these observations we selected 22 early - type galaxies , 17 of which have optically determined stellar ages ( terlevich & forbes 2002 ) . the relevant data for the galaxies in our sample are listed in table 1 . for these sample galaxies",
    "we consider only those observations taken with the smallest pixel scale to maximize the accuracy of the radial and azimuthally averaged mid - infrared emission .",
    "mid - infrared fluxes within small radii are required to detect emission from dust in the galactic cores .",
    "the selected observations were performed in raster mode in the lw3 ( @xmath12 m ) filter .",
    "individual galactic images have been taken with the @xmath13 si : ga array camera with 3@xmath14 pixel scale .",
    "the total on - source integration times for the si : ga array are typically 300 - 600 seconds .",
    "each observation consists of a collection of exposures , each taken with the target galaxy centered at several positions on the array .",
    "two galaxies , ngc 4552 and ic 1409 , have been observed at a plate scale of @xmath15pix and with larger pointing offsets among the individual exposures , allowing raster maps of approximately @xmath16 .",
    "data reduction has been performed using the camera interactive analysis ( cia ) package , version 5.0 @xcite .",
    "the procedure to reduce isocam data starts with the dark current subtraction , for which we used the _ model _ option to take into account the long term drift in the dark current which occurred during the iso mission .",
    "then we removed cosmic ray hits using a sigma clipping filter or multi - resolution method .",
    "this removes most glitches of short duration .",
    "we also visually inspected the frames to manually remove glitches with very long time constants that may affect more than one frame .",
    "si : ga devices are also affected by transient effects in which the response time to any change in illumination depends on the incident photon flux .",
    "this transient behavior needs to be characterized for our specific data set and properly allowed for in recovering the `` stabilized '' electronic signal .",
    "the transient correction was performed using the fouks - schubert method @xcite in which a model of the detector response to incident radiation is used to reconstruct the stabilized fluxes .",
    "we then flat - fielded the data using standard library flats and applied the conversion from electronic units to jy / pix using the standard _ cal ",
    "_ calibration data that accompanies the data products .",
    "after each single exposure has been properly reduced , the final image was produced by registering and coadding each frame .",
    "all 22 galaxies were detected at 15@xmath0 m with a s / n in excess of @xmath17 . in all cases",
    "the field of view was larger than the size of the galaxy , allowing an evaluation of the background flux directly from the galaxy maps .",
    "the sky background was calculated by taking the median pixel value from several blank regions in the reduced frames .",
    "we used the reduction routines in the iraf package to perform both the aperture photometry and the azimuthally averaged radial profiles .",
    "one of the goals in this study is to test the sensitivity of mid - infrared surface brightness profiles to the age of the old stellar population in elliptical galaxies using the known age measurements from optical studies . in principle",
    "it might be possible to determine the stellar age at any galactic radius by comparing the surface brightness profiles at 15@xmath0 m and optical wavelengths .",
    "our measurements of the 15@xmath0 m surface brightness profiles may allow us to detect emission from dust whose spatial distribution does not follow the galactic starlight .",
    "complementary observations of the 15@xmath0 m flux through a small aperture centered on the galactic core are designed to detect emission from optically obscuring dusty clouds observed near the centers of many elliptical galaxies in our sample .",
    "we used the task _ ellipse _ in the iraf _ stsdas _ package to perform elliptical isophote analysis .",
    "the isophote fitting algorithm , described by @xcite , computes best - fitting elliptical isophotes .",
    "it applies iterative corrections to the geometrical parameters of a trial ellipse by projecting the fitted harmonic amplitude onto the image plane .",
    "the output provides all geometrical parameters for the ellipse including the semi - major axis @xmath18 and mean isophotal intensity .",
    "the left panels in figure 1 show the 15@xmath0 m surface brightness profiles for each galaxy as a function of the semi - major axis to the 1/4 power .",
    "most galaxies have surface brightness profiles @xmath19 that are generally in very good agreement with a de vaucouleurs profile , which is a straight line in these plots .",
    "the downward curvature of @xmath19 at small @xmath18 arises because the pixel size becomes too large to properly track the steep de vaucouleurs profiles there .",
    "it has been recognized for some time that mid - infrared emission from relatively warm dust in elliptical galaxies closely follows the de vaucouleurs @xmath20 profile of optical starlight @xcite , indicating that the warm dust is photospheric or circumstellar .",
    "the arrows in the profile plots show the location of @xmath5 for each galaxy where @xmath21 is the effective radius .",
    "the right panels in figure 1 show the ratio of the surface brightness at 15@xmath0 m to that in the i  band where dust emission is not expected .",
    "i  band profiles ( not shown here ) are taken from the studies of @xcite and @xcite . to avoid complications",
    "when comparing the 15@xmath0 m and i - band profiles due to sampling with very different instruments and pixel scales , we discarded the innermost part of the profile of @xmath1 in figure 1 .",
    "the radial profiles for @xmath1 are also truncated at large radii where the low s / n precludes a proper isophotal fit . in the range plotted  where high s / n , low geometrical distortion , and reasonably large number of pixels ensure the most reliable data  the ratio @xmath1 is approximatively constant with radius for most of the galaxies .",
    "although the stellar metallicity ( and dust production ? ) is expected to decrease with galactic radius , this trend is not reflected in the @xmath1 profiles , which are either flat or increase slowly with projected radius .",
    "this insensitivity to stellar metallicity is consistent with the models of @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite observe decreasing 15@xmath0m/7@xmath0 m with galactic radius , but dust may contribute at both these wavelengths .",
    "two galaxies  ngc 5866 and ngc 5044  have discordant 15@xmath0 m surface brightness profiles .",
    "ngc 5866 is an approximately edge - on s0 galaxy with an extensive dusty disk .",
    "the increase in @xmath1 for @xmath22 visible in figure 1 is due to a slope change in @xmath23 that presumably arises from the bulge - disk transition .",
    "azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles for this galaxy are of limited value .",
    "it is debatable if this dusty s0 galaxy should be included in our sample of elliptical galaxies , but we have retained it to see if the dust is visible at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "the @xmath24 profile for ngc 5044 also has a feature visible in figure 1 at @xmath25 caused by asymmetric emission toward the east and southeast that is discussed in more detail below .      at visual wavelengths stellar ages and metallicities in elliptical galaxies",
    "are evaluated from an analysis of spectral indices , assuming single stellar populations ( ssp ) .",
    "since line index strengths in early - type galaxies have radial gradients @xcite , the representative mean ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies refer to a fixed aperture . following @xcite and other authors , we compare 15@xmath0 m and i - band fluxes within an aperture of radius @xmath5 .",
    "photometric data reduction of the 15@xmath0 m maps has been performed using the _ apphot _ package in iraf .",
    "these routines are well suited to compute accurate centers and integrated fluxes within the specified circular aperture .",
    "some galaxies in our sample have relatively small effective radii , requiring an accurate centering algorithm .",
    "it is also essential to account for pixels that span across the @xmath5 aperture to retrieve reliable photometry just within @xmath21/8 .    whenever possible , i - band fluxes within @xmath5 for our sample galaxies are found by integrating published @xmath26 profiles to this radius . for galaxies without published @xmath26 profiles we used",
    "the total apparent corrected i - magnitude from the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) .",
    "then , assuming a de vaucouleurs i - band distribution , we integrated over the @xmath20 profile to determine the flux within the @xmath5 aperture using the appropriate effective radius @xmath21 for each galaxy .",
    "the aperture and surface photometry results are presented in table 2 .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath4 ratios based on the photometry inside @xmath21/8 plotted against the average stellar population age of the galaxies as tabulated by @xcite for this same aperture .",
    "most optical ages have errors less than 20% ; age errors are not plotted for clarity .",
    "the lines in figure 2 show the expected evolution of @xmath4 produced by ssp models from @xcite for metallicities z = 0.02 ( solar ) , z = 0.04 and z = 0.008 .",
    "the predicted flux ratios @xmath4 from @xcite are very insensitive to metallicity variation and vary only weakly for stellar ages @xmath3 gyr .",
    "the observed @xmath4 for galaxies with ages @xmath3 gyr suggest that the variation with stellar age is even less than that predicted by @xcite and that the normalization of the theoretical curves may be a bit too low at ages @xmath9 gyrs .",
    "recently @xcite have provided independent optical ages for a large number of the galaxies in our sample , using models for stellar absorption indices computed with variable stellar @xmath27/fe abundance ratios . while their ages tend to be slightly larger than those quoted by @xcite , our conclusions are unaffected if galactic ages from @xcite were used instead .",
    "some of the galaxies with ages @xmath3 gyr are known to contain central dust clouds and disks ( see table 1 ) , but there is only a limited correspondence with the incidence of optically visible dust and the position of galaxies in figure 2 .    to illustrate the lack of significant 15@xmath0 m emission from central dust , we plot in figure 3 the relationship between @xmath5 aperture flux ratios @xmath4 and the corresponding surface brightness ratios @xmath1 evaluated at @xmath10 , regarded as the ratio for the stellar emission alone .",
    "if central dust clouds contribute to the 15@xmath0 m emission , this would be revealed in @xmath4 but not in @xmath1 .",
    "the data points in figure 3 lie along the 1:1 line with very little scatter , suggesting that the vertical spread of the data showed in figure 2 can not be explained by central dust clouds .",
    "one of the elliptical galaxies with the largest positive deviation in figure 3 is ngc 5831 which contains no dust visible with hst .",
    "if small , centrally located dust is present in these galaxies , its effect on the 15@xmath0 m emission is not prominent .    for stellar ages",
    "@xmath28 gyr the @xmath4 curves in figure 2 from @xcite are very sensitive to stellar age and in general terms this is supported by our observations .",
    "three galaxies in figure 2  ngc 5866 , ngc 6776 and ngc",
    "1316  lie far above the predicted lines for their optically determined ages .",
    "three additional galaxies  ngc 1453 , ngc 4278 and ngc 4261  are marginally higher .",
    "we have already mentioned the unusual s0 galaxy ngc 5866 , a galaxy with a massive dusty disk of cold gas that has been detected in hi and co emission ( roberts et al .",
    "1991 ; welch & sage 2003 ) , so it is not surprising that it has an additional component of non - circumstellar mid - infrared dust emission . of the remaining galaxies , four  ngc 1316 , ngc 1453 , ngc 4261 and ngc 4278  show evidence of recent mergers , have significant hi ( which is unusual for elliptical galaxies ) or have strong radio emission and dusty disks",
    ". however , the remaining galaxy , ngc 6776 , seems to be rather normal but does have a faint shell that may be merger - related . on balance , therefore , it appears that 15@xmath0 m observations can be used to identify post - merger ellipticals but the theoretical ssp flux ratios plotted in figure 2 may unfortunately be too simplistic to fully describe the complexities of post - merger dust formation .",
    "the agreement of ngc 5018 with the @xcite predictions may be fortuitous since there is some evidence of hi and radio emission from this galaxy .",
    "however , it appears to be significant that all four of the ellipticals with the lowest values of @xmath4 in figure 2  ngc 5831 , ngc 720 , ngc 2300 and ngc 4649  have been observed with hst and found to contain no visible central dust .",
    "in figure 4 we show 15@xmath0 m images of six galaxies from our sample that have low luminosity extensions in various directions from the emission peak which is coincident with the optical galaxy . with a pixel scale of 3@xmath14",
    "the isocam beam size in the lw3 filter is approximately 5@xmath14 fwhm .",
    "thus , some of the features in the central 30@xmath14 of ngc1316 and ngc1453 are clearly resolved . in the remaining galaxies ,",
    "other non - axisymmetric emission features are apparent but are not resolved by these observations . apart from ngc 5044",
    ", the azimuthally averaged 15@xmath0 m surface brightness profiles tend to wash out the faint isophotal extensions visible in figure 4 . in general ,",
    "we have been unable to find emission at other frequencies that correlates with these mid - infrared features .",
    "the exception to this is ngc 1316 ( fornax a ) a galaxy thought to have had recent merger ( schweizer 1980 ; geldzahler & fomalont 1984 ) . dust and gas appear to be falling into ngc 1316 , forming a disk - like pattern @xmath30 in radius in the se - nw direction , roughly parallel to the jet radio axis @xcite . the extended emission in our 15@xmath0 m image is entirely consistent with emission from optically visible dust in these same regions , confirming the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "recently the spitzer space telescope @xcite has observed ngc1316 with the irac @xcite instrument in four mid - infrared bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 m . the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of the camera allow us to better resolve the emission in the central @xmath31 of the galaxy .",
    "the 8@xmath0 m image in figure 5 ( left panel ) shows in great detail and at higher s / n the same asymmetrical features present in the iso 15@xmath0 m image ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "many bright knots and an arc - like structure are prominent and well resolved by irac .    the right panel in fig .",
    "5 shows a contour plot of the emission at 8.0@xmath0 m once the stellar continuum is subtracted using a scaled 3.6 @xmath0 m image . the non  stellar emission",
    "is then superimposed to a b ",
    "i hst image ( grayscale ) ( press release stsci - pr99 - 06 , grillmair et al .",
    "1999 ) where the dust distribution is shown in dark extended features .",
    "the correspondence of the non ",
    "stellar 8@xmath0 m emission features with the dust seen in absorption by hst is remarkable .",
    "almost every feature visible in the optical absorption study , included the central one , has 8@xmath0 m emission associated .    the 8.0@xmath0 m broadband filter sample the emission band centered at `` 7.7@xmath0 m '' from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) molecules .",
    "much of the excess emission in this band must then be attributed to pahs , but the coincidence of the bright spots with the 15@xmath0 m image in the region where the spitzer and iso data overlap is indicative that warm small dust grains also contribute to the mid - infrared emission .",
    "perhaps young , luminous stars are forming in the infalling dusty gas , raising the dust temperature sufficiently to emit at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "it is interesting that dust located at large radii in ngc1316 is associated with 15@xmath0 m emission , while optically visible dust in the galactic cores is not .",
    "this may occur because only stars of rather low ( jeans ) mass can form near the galactic cores where the gas pressures are very high .",
    "but the mass of molecular hydrogen in the dusty patches along the central se - nw direction in ngc 1316 , @xmath32 @xmath33 @xcite , exceeds by @xmath34 the mass of dusty cold gas typically observed in elliptical galaxy cores , and this may be the best explanation for the associated star formation .",
    "finally , it seems odd that the low luminosity extensions in the 15@xmath0 m image of ngc 5044 , which we believe to be real , are strong enough to alter the surface brightness profile but still have no easily identifiable correlated emission at other frequencies .",
    "we have found that the infrared emission at 15@xmath0 m from elliptical galaxies , normalized by the i - band emission , can provide an approximate measure of the mean age of galactic stars .",
    "similar to the predictions of @xcite , the central flux ratios @xmath4 generally increase for ( 1 ) ellipticals known to have stellar ages @xmath2 gyrs and particularly for ( 2 ) ellipticals that exhibit unusual attributes associated with recent mergers : dusty disks , hi emission , non - thermal radio emission , shells , etc .",
    "however , if only normal , non - merging galaxies are considered , the central flux ratios @xmath4 for galaxies in our sample shows little or no convincing variation with optically determined stellar ages . since reliable estimates of the dust mass in elliptical galaxies",
    "are not available , it is not possible to quantify the excess 15@xmath0 m emission expected from a given amount of dust .",
    "however , the four ellipticals having the lowest observed values of @xmath4 all appear to be dust - free in hst observations .",
    "some individual galaxies seem inconsistent with these general trends .",
    "ngc 6776 has an unusually large @xmath4 , but only modest optical evidence for a recent merger .",
    "ngc 7626 and ngc 4374 have optically obscuring central dust and double radio lobes but rather normal @xmath4 .",
    "the strong correlation between the flux ratio @xmath4 measured within @xmath5 and @xmath1 evaluated at @xmath10 indicates that 15@xmath0 m emission from optically visible dust in the cores of some of our sample galaxies is not detectable with iso .",
    "this contrasts with the more distant dust in the merging galaxy ngc 1316 which is a local source of 15@xmath0 m emission .",
    "evidently , massive dust - heating stars are forming in ngc 1316 , but not in the dusty cores of many other ellipticals .",
    "as in ngc 1316 , five additional elliptical galaxies show non - stellar extended features in their 15@xmath0 m images . while we believe these features are real , they do not appear associated with emission at other wavelengths",
