    "one of the most significant products of redshift surveys is a map of large scale structure .",
    "this in turn allows us to calculate the velocity field induced by density contrasts over cosmic time . for this",
    "we often use the linear approximation that the acceleration of a galaxy does not change much over time and that velocities are not just dimensionally equivalent to acceleration multiplied by the hubble time , but also proportional to it .",
    "regions of high overdensity are to be avoided when using the linear approximation , as turnaround and virialization follow the rise of galaxy density to high levels . in the era of precision cosmology , when measuring the hubble constant to 1% is our aspiration ( bennett et al 2014 , suyu et al 2012 ) for a variety of compelling physical reasons , peculiar velocities need to be better measured and calculated by local redshift surveys .",
    "the state of the art is illustrated by lavaux & tully ( 2010 ) and magoulas et al ( 2012 ) . the fact that approximately 70% of the universe is dark energy and that dark energy is not physically understood ( bintruy 2013 ) suggests that we should not ignore alternatives to newton s gravity and einstein s gravity at scales larger than those of classical gr tests .",
    "modified gravity laws can not yet be ruled out . in this paper",
    "we explore one such gravity law applied to the 2mrs density distribution ( huchra et al 2012 ) , namely milgrom s modification of newtonian gravity ( mond ) ( milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "we find that , while well motivated for kpc scales , it predicts a velocity field different from what we have observed , for example in the 6df galaxy survey ( jones et al 2009 ) .",
    "the unification of mond with space expanding on mpc scales with a scale factor @xmath2 is a work in progress .",
    "close to 40 years history of mond has been reviewed by sanders ( 2015 ) and bothun ( 2015 ) .",
    "there is a general problem with all attempts to address large scale structure problems within the mondian framework : the framework does not exist !",
    "there is no cosmological mond theory is the standard answer of mondian aficionados .",
    "be that as it may , the growth of density inhomogeneities ( @xmath3 ) in that theory has been studied by nusser ( 2002 ) and llinares ( 2008 , 2014 ) .",
    "we note that the peculiar acceleration due to an overdensity in newtonian gravity is given by peacock ( 1999 )    @xmath4    where peculiar velocity * v * = a * u * and by nusser ( 2002 ) as    @xmath5    in the curl - free mondian case with @xmath6 the present matter density . to avoid ambiguity",
    "we write the mond acceleration parameter a@xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "our purpose in this paper is not to join this development of mond or teves ( bekenstein 2004 ) to deal with groups of galaxies or cosmological simulations ( angus et al 2013 ) ; rather we wish to motivate the extension of peculiar velocity surveys beyond 6dfgs by illustrating the power of peculiar velocities to investigate both structure and gravity on the largest scales .",
    "for calculating peculiar velocities from 2mrs we have followed erdodu et al ( 2006 ) and used the formulation by peebles ( 1980 ) and davis et al ( 2011 ) in the usual notation with * g(r ) * representing the gravitational acceleration at * r *    @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 the bias parameter .",
    "on mpc scales we are in the ` deep - mond ' regime ( zhao et al 2013 ) beyond the interpolation formulae between mond and newtonian gravity used in the internal dynamics of galaxies , so that the gravitational acceleration under mond can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a newtonian r@xmath0 acceleration field and @xmath15 = @xmath16 with @xmath17 10@xmath18 m / s@xmath19 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) of zhao et al with @xmath20 yields this definition of @xmath21 .",
    "our calculation therefore proceeds by substituting the mondian acceleration for the newtonian one in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath22 is calculated from the bias factor , measured for this sample to be @xmath12 = 1.48 @xmath23 0.27 ( beutler et al 2012 ) .",
    "nusser ( 2014 ) has pointed out that not only are we assuming the linear approximation in doing this , and thus erring in high density regions , but also we are neglecting velocities generated at early times , where @xmath24 is the time spent in the newtonian regime and @xmath25 is time spent in the mond regime .",
    "@xmath26 depends on the amplitude of the initial fluctuations . ] .",
    "such initial peculiar velocities are subject to adiabatic decay , however , over the age of the universe ( davis et al 2011 ) .",
    "in this calculation , and generally in n - body codes , each particle communicates with every other particle . in the mondian case every grid point that looks at the shapley supercluster , sees an overdensity not fully attenuated , as the luminosity field is , by r@xmath0 and wants to move towards shapley .",
    "the outcome of this is figures 1 and 2 , which depict the velocity field . in figure 1",
    "we see a smooth flow with a coherence length as large as the volume .",
    "it is quite unlike the observed velocity field , and there is no free parameter to remedy it .    in figures 3",
    "& 4 we see the predicted velocity distribution functions in the sgx coordinate .",
    "these figures are not the problem .",
    "there are two free parameters @xmath22 and , to some degree , @xmath8 that can be adjusted to bring the speed everywhere into the range that we observers see in the cosmic microwave background rest frame . by contrast , figures 2 and 4  for the newtonian case do resemble the observed velocity field , and can be brought into agreement with it with @xmath27 0.6 ( magoulas et al 2012 , 2015 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows both the density and velocity fields for standard model cosmological parameters .",
    "a formal comparison of the prediction of mond and 6dfgs observations is made in figure 6 .",
    "here we show bulk flow velocity as a function of scale . to calculate this",
    ", we create a large number of spheres of particular radii and average the velocities within each .",
    "to reconcile mond and observations in this plot would require a four order of magnitude change in @xmath8 , which would disrupt the agreement between mond predictions and galaxy rotation curves ( swaters et al 2010 ) .",
    "the mismatch between our observations and mond rules out mond . as we see below , the standard erdodu r@xmath0 model , on the other hand , agrees with the observations within the uncertainties .",
    "we have also calculated the velocity angular correlation function as follows . for every pair of galaxies in the 6dfgs peculiar velocity sample the angle between the radial peculiar velocities",
    "is calculated .",
    "figure 7 shows the probability that this angle @xmath28 is small ( @xmath29 0.9 ) as a function of separation . in mond small misalignments continue to large galaxy separations . in the erdodu model",
    "the fall off is more rapid .",
    "again , the data are most inconsistent with mond",
    ". for galaxy separations between 20/h and 100/h mpc @xmath30 per degree of freedom is over five times larger for mond than it is for the @xmath31 prediction .",
    "absolute values of @xmath30 are hard to calculate exactly because of the expected failure of the linear approximation at separations smaller than 20 mpc and the non - gaussian probability distributions of 6dfgs peculiar velocities ( springob et al 2014 ) .",
    "the coherence length of velocity structure measured as an e - folding scale for this function is 2600 km / s for 6dfgs , 2700 km / s for the newtonian 2mrs model and 3300 km / sec for the mond model .",
    "peculiar velocities are not a unique probe of modified gravity at the 10 mpc scale .",
    "weak lensing coupled with galaxy redshifts also provides a good constraint ( reyes et al 2010 ) .",
    "focussing on peculiar velocities , however , we conclude + ( 1 ) mond predicts a velocity field overwhelmingly dominated by the largest overdensities on the largest scales ( 100 mpc ) that we have tested here",
    ". the velocity angular correlation function shows markedly worse agreement with 6dfgs in the mondian case than in the acceleration @xmath32 case .",
    "+ ( 2 ) smaller well established features observed in the flow field such as the infall into the great attractor ( e.g. lynden bell et al 1987 , mathewson & ford 1994 ) and into the perseus pisces supercluster ( e.g. han & mould 1992 ) are not seen in the mond flow field .",
    "+ ( 3 ) if we consider modified gravities more broadly than mond , those with accelerations that fall off more slowly than r@xmath0 will tend to run into similar problems , but these would need to be statistically tested for a mismatch with peculiar velocity data .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the velocity power spectrum ( johnson et al 2014 ) is a fine basis for such tests .",
    "evidence for more power on large scales than @xmath33cdm predicts under the linear approximation and standard gravity is at the 2@xmath34 level currently ( feldman et al 2011 ) .",
    "larger scale coherence than discussed here is seen ( tully 1989 , tully et al 2014 ) .",
    "the relevance of modified gravity to such observations remains to be seen .",
