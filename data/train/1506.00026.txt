    "graphene is a two dimensional crystal composed of carbon atoms which are packed in a honeycomb ( hexagonal ) lattice @xcite .",
    "it attracts considerable interest because of its unique electronic properties ; most of them are related to existence of two conical points in the electron energy spectrum ( fermi points ) and `` massless dirac fermion '' character of charge carriers with energy and momentum close to the fermi points @xcite .",
    "it results in numerous quantum relativistic phenomena such as klein tunneling , minimal conductivity through evanescent waves , relativistic collapse at a supercritical charge , etc . , establishing an interesting and fruitful relation between fundamental physics and materials science @xcite .",
    "the effective `` velocity of light '' ( fermi velocity ) for the dirac fermions in graphene is relatively small , @xmath0 , and the interaction between the quasiparticles in graphene can be approximated by the instantaneous coulomb potential with the effective coupling constant ] @xmath1 .",
    "this interaction is therefore quite strong , which results in a rich variety of phenomena @xcite . within the dirac model , before the experimental discovery of graphene , it was shown that the long - range character of coulomb interaction results in a renormalization of the fermi velocity which is divergent at zero temperature and zero doping leading to a non - fermi - liquid behaviour @xcite ; this prediction has been recently confirmed experimentally @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", dirac model gives us many - body renormalization of electronic properties only for small coupling constant and only with the logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the higher - order terms were considered in refs . @xcite but still within the dirac model . to calculate quantitatively",
    "correctly these properties one needs to work with the lattice model and with a realistic potential of electron - electron interaction @xmath2 taking into account its screening by the @xmath3-electrons .",
    "the corresponding first - principle results @xcite can be parametrized by the phenomenological potential .",
    "this modification of the interaction potential at small scales in comparison with the bare coulomb potential was proved to affect some graphene properties significantly ( for instance , the phase diagram of graphene @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of papers @xcite carried out the monte - carlo study of graphene properties based on the tight - binding hamiltonian without the expansion near the fermi points . within this approach",
    "one can introduce an arbitrary phenomenological potential @xmath2 . using the tight - binding hamiltonian on the hexagonal lattice",
    ", we are going to build the perturbation theory in @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that the theory built in this way is important and interesting for the following reasons .",
    "the theory based on the tight - binding hamiltonian has more common features with real graphene physics than the effective theory based on the expansion in the vicinity of dirac points .",
    "for instance , the tight - binding hamiltonian `` remembers '' graphene properties such as geometry of hexagonal lattice or the natural energy scale such as @xmath4-bandwidth , which are absent in the effective dirac theory .",
    "moreover , one can include a phenomenological potential in this theory , which is closer to the real graphene physics than the bare coulomb potential .",
    "in addition , the theory based on the tight - binding hamiltonian and the phenomenological interaction @xmath2 can be easily improved .",
    "for instance , one can study the effects appearing due to the inclusion of the next - to - the - nearest - neighbour hopping or nonzero chemical potential .",
    "note that such study can not be carried out within the monte - carlo simulation because of the well known sign problem .",
    "finally , if the electron properties of other nanomaterials are formulated in terms of the tight - binding hamiltonian and the phenomenological potential , it makes no difficulties to apply the results of this paper to study these materials .",
    "lattice simulation of graphene were proved to be a very efficient and quickly developing approach for studying the properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "an important feature of all these simulations is that they are conducted at the finite lattice , at the finite temperature and with the finite discretization errors . in order to check the lattice results and estimate the discretization uncertainty in the weak coupling region",
    "it is very useful to develop the perturbation theory which accounts all these effects .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the theory with the arbitrary phenomenological potential is not renormalizable since it contains four - fermion terms .",
    "however , lattice formulation provides the ultraviolet ( spacing between carbon atoms ) and the infrared ( the finite size of the lattice ) regulators . for this reason the theory on the hexagonal lattice is well defined .",
    "finally , one should mention that the interaction in graphene is strong , so the application of the perturbation theory is questionable .",
    "however , we believe that even at the one - loop level one can study some important physical effects .",
    "one can also expect that the perturbation theory built in this paper can well describe graphene many - body effects similarly to the rpa based on effective theory of graphene@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we built the perturbation theory which is based on the tight binding hamiltonian and arbitrary interaction potential between electrons . in the section 3",
    "we calculate one - loop corrections to the electron propagator .",

    "we choose the vacuum state that satisfies the following conditions : @xmath29 so there is an electron with spin @xmath30 at every lattice site and no electrons with spin @xmath31 . as our main goal is to calculate the partition function @xmath32 , which contains summation over all states , the specific choice of @xmath33 will not affect any physical results .",

    "the nlo value of the dielectric permittivity for suspended graphene is approximately by 30 % smaller than the lo result , which is not very large .",
    "moreover , the monte - carlo results @xcite tell us that the higher order corrections to the lo result can be even smaller than 30 % .",
    "for this reason one can expect that the accuracy of formulas ( [ epsilonr ] ) , ( [ polarization ] ) is rather good .",
