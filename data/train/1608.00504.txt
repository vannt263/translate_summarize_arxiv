    "the hilbert space for the proximized double - dot system has the dimension 16 .",

    "in this section , we give an overview of how the local and nonlocal proximization affects quantum transport in absence of interdot tunneling . in particular , we start discussing the two limits @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "both limits feature a resonant current originating from the car process .",
    "the former case of weak interdot coulomb energy is typically realized in experiments.@xcite the limit of strong interdot coulomb energy additionally permits to study resonant currents which are entirely characterized by lar . throughout this work , we consider identical quantum dots , i.e. @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we limit to the case of equal orbital levels in the two quantum dots , @xmath87 , and equal chemical potentials @xmath88 .          in fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru](a ) , we show a density plot of the current in the right lead @xmath90 as a function of the dots level @xmath91 , which can be tuned by gate voltages , and the chemical potential @xmath92 of the normal leads .",
    "we notice that the current in the normal leads obeys the symmetry @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "this symmetry is due the particle - hole ( ph ) symmetry of the hamiltonian eq .   in the absence of interdot tunneling .",
    "we focus on the situation @xmath95 which corresponds to the transport of cooper pairs from the superconductor to the double - dot system .",
    "two resonances can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru](a ) : one at @xmath96 that is caused only by car and another at @xmath97 which originates from both car and lar .",
    "the current is asymmetrical with respect to the chemical potentials @xmath92 .",
    "the bias asymmetry of the car peak is due to the triplet blockade : for @xmath98 tunneling of electrons from the leads can bring the double - dot in a triplet state whose spin symmetry is incompatible with the bcs superconductor , hence blocking the car.@xcite    along the level position axis , the car resonance is centered at @xmath99 and its broadening is @xmath100 .",
    "this can be seen in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru ] ) , which shows the current at constant @xmath101 for two different values of the nonlocal coupling : @xmath102 ( dashed line ) and @xmath103 ( solid line ) .",
    "the car broadening is proportional to the nonlocal coupling @xmath37 but its height does not depend on it .",
    "the car resonance instead follows the singlet population , i.e. @xmath104 , as can be seen in panel ( d ) .",
    "the states involved in the car process are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and in fact one only observes the corresponding populations , @xmath108 . on the contrary ,",
    "the resonance at @xmath109 is mainly due to the lar , but involves also car as indicated by the non - vanishing singlet population at the lar resonance [ see panel ( d ) ] .",
    "we will discuss now that strong superconducting coupling may also generate negative differential conductance ( ndc ) when single electron tunneling events with the normal leads are accompanied by a simultaneous exchange of a cooper - pair .",
    "for instance if one of the dots is doubly occupied , while the other is singly occupied , it can occur that an electron leaves the system through a normal - metal lead and the two remaining electrons tunnel ( locally or nonlocally ) to the superconductor .",
    "if the process is energetically admissible the total current is reduced instead of increased by the opening of the new resonance and ndc is observed .",
    "this is indeed observed in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru ] having defined the conductance as @xmath110 .",
    "we show @xmath111 as function of the chemical potential , for a fixed level position @xmath112 .",
    "the differential conductance becomes negative around @xmath113 ( leftmost peak ) .",
    "this extra resonance corresponds energetically to the transition from the triply occupied states to the empty state , @xmath114 , where two electrons tunnel in the superconductor and the remaining electron tunnels in one of the normal leads .",
    "this involves _ only _ the exchange of a nonlocal cooper pair and is no longer present in the absence of nonlocal coupling [ dot - dashed line in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru ] ] . in order to increase the visibility of the ndc we have chosen a stronger nonlocal coupling @xmath115 ( by increasing @xmath116 ) to obtain a higher peak value and slightly higher temperatures to increase the linewidth of this resonance in comparison to other figures .      for finite interdot coulomb energy the lar dominated resonance in fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru](a ) splits into two resonances at gate voltages @xmath117 and @xmath118 as can be seen in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_uapproxgs ] . the former current resonance is purely affected by lar involving the states @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , in panel  [ fig.:limit_uapproxgs](d ) one observes that only the corresponding populations are non vanishing , i.e. @xmath120 and that the current is proportional the population of the doubly occupied state , @xmath121 .",
    "we still observe the asymmetry of the nonlocal - current resonances in the chemical potential due to the triplet blockade . additionally , one notices an asymmetry of the lar resonances , which can be explained partly by the triplet blockade mechanism and partly by energy considerations .",
    "the central resonance at @xmath118 is affected both by the lar and the car processes . for an intermediate value of the chemical potentials",
    "[ see dashed line in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig.:limit_uapproxgs ] ) ] its width is roughly proportional to @xmath122 and vanishes if @xmath37 becomes maximal . in panel ( c )",
    "we demonstrate the effect of the nonlocal cooper - pair tunneling on the current resonances , for an intermediate value of the chemical potentials and for different values of the nonlocal coupling @xmath37 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the dashed line in panel ( b ) .",
    "when @xmath115 approaches its maximum , the width of the central resonance ( left peak ) tends to zero while its height remains unaffected .",
    "we suspect that the behavior of the width of this central resonance is due to the mutual exclusion of the local cooper - pair tunneling process and the nonlocal one , and originates from a destructive interference of the two channels ( see also later ) . on the contrary , if both processes were independent , the linewidth would be the sum of both contributions . in conclusion this regime of finite interdot coulomb energy can be helpful to assess the strength of the nonlocal coupling @xmath37 in comparison to the local terms .",
    "( a ) current @xmath123 through the right lead as a function of the gate voltage @xmath124 and chemical potential @xmath125 for finite interdot tunneling with @xmath126 and the so angle @xmath127 .",

    "( b ) current @xmath123 for the same parameters as in panel ( a ) but for finite so interaction with an so angle of @xmath132 . ]    in this section , we consider the effect of finite interdot tunneling and so interaction on the current @xmath123 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider in the following only the case @xmath127 ( no so coupling ) and @xmath133 ( finite so coupling with @xmath134 ) .",
    "let us first focus on the general behavior of the current as a function of the level position and chemical potential as shown in the density plots of fig .",
    "[ fig.:finite_so ] . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case without interdot coulomb energy , @xmath128 , which describes well the situation of @xmath82 . finally , in order to see stronger signatures of the interdot tunneling term we generally consider @xmath135 .    in the top panel",
    "we show the case of finite interdot tunneling in the absence of so coupling , i.e. @xmath127 , which can be directly compared with the density plot of fig .",
    "[ fig.:limit_gsbiggeru](a ) where the interdot tunneling was absent .",
    "one immediately sees that the andreev resonant lines ( black solid lines ) are generally split in comparison to the case without interdot tunneling , giving rise to an even richer andreev - bound - state spectrum .",
    "the most general observation is that the ph symmetry of the transport properties , as discussed in section [ sec.:transportoverview ] , is broken , i.e. @xmath136 with @xmath94 .",
    "the breaking of the ph symmetry in transport is observed if both the quantities @xmath137 . on the other hand if one of these quantities vanishes the ph symmetry is restored .",
    "we discuss ph - symmetry breaking in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec.:breakingph ] .        in the bottom panel of figure [ fig.:finite_so ] , instead",
    ", we show how the current is affected by tunneling in the presence of the so coupling , for the case @xmath132 .",
    "we see that in this case the ph symmetry is again restored for any value of of @xmath37 and @xmath116 .",
    "note that the andreev addition energies spectrum becomes also quite intricate and it is not so useful to enter in the details of the behavior of any resonant line .",
    "in general one can see that in comparison to the top panel crossings and avoided crossings occur between different pairs of andreev levels .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the different symmetry of the tunnel coupling between the two dots in the two cases .",
    "finally , for @xmath137 , the car peaks are split along the level - position axis and an extra resonance appears .",
    "we will discuss in detail the nature of this extra resonance in sec .",
    "[ sec.:carshift ]      to investigate the ph symmetry breaking , we apply the ph transformation @xmath138 to eq .",
    "( [ eq.:heff ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that indeed this transformation leaves obviously unaffected the local and nonlocal pairing terms but is equivalent to a change of sign of the interdot tunneling term , i.e. @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the symmetry obeyed by the current is @xmath140 which we have numerically verified .",
    "notice that the sign of @xmath141 in the tunneling hamiltonian _ can not _ be gauged away only if _ both _ the local and nonlocal pairing terms are present in eq .",
    "( [ eq.:heff ] ) .",
    "finally , we notice that for @xmath142 the sign of @xmath141 is unessential due to kramer s degeneracy and therefore the ph symmetry is restored in this special case .",
    "it remains the question why the sign and more generally a phase of @xmath141 is detectable in the transport properties of the system .",
    "this is essentially due to the interference between two paths connecting the empty state with the singlet state .",
    "one path is the nonlocal andreev tunneling with rate @xmath37 while the other is the process where a cooper - pair virtually tunnels into one of the dots bringing it in the doubly occupied state and subsequently this state is converted into a singlet state by interdot tunneling .",
    "the interference between the two paths is clearly affected by the phase ( not only the sign ) of @xmath141 . in order to observe this interference effect the doubly occupied state of a single dot needs to be accessible .",
    "we have verified that , for @xmath143 , an overall phase of @xmath141 does not affect the transport properties of the system .",
    "we focus on the effect of the interdot tunneling on the car resonance . in fig .",
    "[ fig.:carpeak ] ( a)-(c ) we show the evolution of the car current peak for different values of @xmath144 for @xmath127 . for increasing strength of the interdot tunneling , the position of the car resonance shifts to the right and at the same time the resonance linewidth changes .",

    "so interaction ( @xmath151 ) leads instead to a level repulsion between the unpolarized triplet state @xmath152 and the symmetric state @xmath153 .",
    "the symmetric state , virtually occupied by local cooper - pair tunneling , plays the role of a dark state . ]    these observations can be explained by making use of a reduced hilbert space which describes well the system in the vicinity of the car resonance .",
    "this simplified model is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig.:eff_level_struc ] .",

    "therefore , the linewidth can be approximated by @xmath184 which fits ( solid lines ) well the numerical results based on the full hamiltonian , see fig .",
    "[ fig.:carpeak](e)-(f ) .",
    "interestingly eq .",
    "explains also why for positive ( negative ) sign of @xmath141 the linewidth can decrease ( increase ) due to destructive ( constructive ) interference .",
    "this is seen comparing the results for @xmath185 in panel ( e ) and ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig.:carpeak ] . finally , one intriguing consequence of the virtual - state process involving the state @xmath153 is that it generates nonlocal entangled electrons even in the absence of a direct nonlocal coupling .",
    "current @xmath123 in the car resonance as a function of the gate voltage for different values of the tunneling amplitude , @xmath186 , @xmath132 for @xmath187 ( solid line ) and @xmath188 ( dashed line ) keeping fixed the @xmath189 .",
    "other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig.:carpeak ] . ]",
    "we now turn our attention to the case with the so coupling and @xmath133 .",
    "we see in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig.:finite_so ] that the car resonance splits into two lines , one at @xmath190 and the other shifted towards higher values of @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.:so_peak ] we show the behavior of the car peak with increasing values of @xmath141 for constant values of @xmath189 and @xmath37 .",
    "first we notice that for @xmath188 ( dashed lines ) the car peak does not split but it shifts to the right for increasing values of @xmath149 and no resonance is present at @xmath190 .",
    "instead , for @xmath191 , the resonance splits into two resonances , one fixed at @xmath190 and the other right - shifted with @xmath192 .",
    "this demonstrates the connection with the nonlocal term @xmath37 of the car peak at @xmath190 .",
    "we numerically observed that the current of the right - shifted peak follows the population of the unpolarized triplet state , @xmath193 .",
    "these observations suggest that a resonant mechanism involving the virtual occupation of the @xmath153 is established with the unpolarized triplet state @xmath152 , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig.:eff_level_struc ] .",
    "this mechanism is analogous to the one induced by the nonlocal singlet proximity in the case of interdot coupling where @xmath127 .",
    "we refer to this resonance as triplet car resonance , since it generates nonlocal entanglement with triplet symmetry .",
    "the position and linewidth of this right - shifted resonance are described by eq .",
    "and eq .   setting @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a @xmath2-wave superconductor can not induce directly triplet correlations .",
    "this shows how the presence of so coupling can nevertheless induce nonlocal triplet superconducting correlations even when the only superconducting lead has @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry.@xcite",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of a cooper - pair splitter based on a double - quantum dot . employing a master - equation description , in the framework of fcs",
    ", we have calculated the current injected into the normal leads .",
    "we have considered a finite intra - dot interaction which allows the local transfer of cooper - pairs from the superconductor to an individual quantum dot .",
    "we have studied the signatures of local and nonlocal andreev reflection in the current injected in the normal leads .",
    "the interdot coulomb interaction separates the local and nonlocal resonances .",
    "the effect of interdot tunneling both with and without so coupling has been considered , too .",
    "in particular , we find that the interdot tunneling can induce nonlocal entanglement starting from local andreev reflection .",
    "furthermore , a process including the virtual doubly - occupied states of the individual dots leads to modifications of the position and linewidth of the current resonances . for the case with so coupling , we find that a nonlocal triplet pair amplitude can be generated in the system .",
    "this mechanism involving the virtual occupation of the doubly occupied states is active only for finite intradot coulomb interaction .",

    "in this section we provide the decomposition of the system hamiltonian @xmath42 into sectors with even and odd parity .",
    "we assume the single particle level spacing in the quantum dot to be large compared to @xmath8 , @xmath194 and the interdot tunneling @xmath141 , so the total dimension of the system hilbert space reduces to @xmath195 states ( @xmath196 even @xmath197 @xmath196 odd ) . here",
