    "a large variety of independent astronomical observations have revealed that most of the mass in the universe is some form of non - baryonic , non - luminous , cold dark matter of as yet unknown composition .",
    "understanding the fundamental nature of dark matter is one of the biggest outstanding problems in cosmology and particle physics ( for a comprehensive review , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "compelling particle candidates for the dark matter , collectively termed weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , exist in several well - motivated theoretical extensions of the standard model of particle physics like supersymmetry ( lightest supersymmetric particle , for a review see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and universal extra dimensions ( lightest kaluza - klein particle , for a review see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . a signal from dark matter could be detected in astronomical observations from wimp pair annihilation or decay .",
    "for example , wimp annihilation or decay generically leads to the production of gamma - rays ( as well as of other high energy particles ) , potentially at a detectable level with current telescopes @xcite .",
    "the unparalleled sensitivity of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) at gev energies makes it an excellent instrument to look for this gamma - ray signal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the recent detection by pamela of a positron excess relative to cosmic - ray secondary production in the galaxy @xcite and a gentle but clear feature in the _",
    "fermi_-lat positron - electron ( @xmath0 ) spectrum @xcite has led to intense discussion of the possibility that one or both of these signals are due to dark matter .",
    "if true , we expect a corresponding signal in gamma - rays stemming from both the annihilation or decay event itself , as well as from the secondary inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattering of background radiation by the high energy @xmath1 and @xmath2 produced .",
    "as far as dark matter annihilation is concerned , first year _ fermi _ observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies , clusters of galaxies , the extragalactic gamma - ray background , and searches for gamma - ray lines have placed some of the strongest constraints yet on the possible wimp pair annihilation cross - section and have already excluded some annihilation models that might explain the pamela positron excess @xcite .",
    "in addition , several authors have recently pointed out that gamma - ray data ( including early _ fermi _ results ) also put constraints on the dark matter decay explanation of the pamela data , excluding some , but not all , of the relevant parameter space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these studies typically utilize _",
    "fermi_-lat measurements of the diffuse galactic and isotropic gamma - ray emission or _",
    "fermi _ sky maps and require that the expected decay signal from the milky way halo or the summed contribution from extragalactic dark matter not overproduce the observed gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "limits on the dark matter lifetime from the observation of dwarf galaxies with atmospheric cherenkov telescopes have also been derived in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these analyses indicate that current gamma - ray constraints on the decaying dark matter scenario are generically weaker than those on annihilating dark matter , with respect to the regions of parameter space providing an explanation to the cosmic - ray electron - positron anomalies .",
    "moreover , as we review in the next section , several theoretical arguments imply that dark matter lifetimes in the range needed to explain the cosmic - ray anomalies are at least plausible , specifically in the context of supersymmetric grand unification @xcite .    beyond the interest in scenarios where",
    "decaying dark matter might be related to the cosmic - ray anomalies , several particle physics frameworks feature dark matter candidates with a long , but finite , lifetime .",
    "we provide an overview of some of these models in the next section .",
    "the present study targets this general class of theories as well , and we consider here decay final states that can be regarded as representative for a wide range of scenarios",
    ". searches for dark matter decay with gamma ray observations are therefore not only phenomenologically motivated , as they can test the dark matter interpretation of the observed cosmic - ray anomalies , but they also probe theoretically compelling extensions to the standard model of particle physics .",
    "while already significant , much can be done to improve the current limits on decaying dark matter models . in this work ,",
    "we show that novel and significant constraints can be placed on the dark matter decay lifetime for both quark - antiquark decay final states as well as for leptonic final states giving a good fit the cosmic - ray anomalies using _",
    "fermi_-lat observations of isolated dark matter dominated objects like nearby clusters of galaxies , dwarf spheroidal galaxies , and m31 .",
    "in fact , the simulations of @xcite which compared the gamma - ray flux from dark matter annihilation and decay in nearby large - scale structures as reconstructed from constrained cosmological simulations predict that nearby clusters and filaments are good targets for searches for and constraints on a signal from dark matter decay , and here we derive such constraints with recent _ fermi _ observations . in  2 , we discuss and introduce selected dark matter decay models , in  3 we discuss the selection of targets and the modeling of their dark matter content , and in  4 we present our results on the constraints on the decay lifetime .",
    "while stable on the scale of cosmological structure formation , the particle making up the universal dark matter might well have a finite lifetime , @xmath3 .",
    "if this is the case , and if the dark matter particle decays into ( visible ) standard models particles , the decay process can be _ indirectly _ detected .",
    "depending on the particle lifetime , non - thermal secondary particles resulting from dark matter decay can affect key `` episodes '' in the early universe such as the synthesis of light elements or the decoupling of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . in turn , light elemental abundances and the cmb spectrum can be used to set constraints on particle models where the dark matter is unstable ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is no shortage of particle models where the universal dark matter is unstable , including unstable supersymmetric particles , moduli as dark matter particles , super - heavy dark matter candidates , axinos and sterile neutrinos @xcite . interestingly ,",
    "particle candidates that would otherwise be completely un - detectable , such as gravitinos in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , can in principle provide indirect clues on their nature if they decay @xcite . among the decay particle debris ,",
    "gamma rays and antimatter ( such as energetic cosmic - ray positrons , anti - protons and anti - deuterons ) are ideal signals for indirect dark matter detection .",
    "as such , gamma - ray and cosmic - ray antimatter data have been extensively used to set constraints on the lifetime of meta - stable particle dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of an exceptionally large flux of high - energy cosmic - ray positrons ( @xmath4 gev ) , compared to conventional models of galactic secondary positron production , reported by the pamela space - borne experiment @xcite prompted great interest in possible non - standard sources .",
    "another recently launched satellite experiment , _",
    "fermi_-lat , also showed the existence of a gentle but clear feature in the spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons - plus - positrons at energies of several hundreds of gev , especially when supplemented with even higher energy data from the h.e.s.s .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescope @xcite . while possibly pointing to nearby astrophysical sources such as mature ( characteristic age @xmath5 yr ) pulsars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the feature detected by _ fermi_-lat and the rise in the pamela positron fraction might share a common , more exotic origin : galactic dark matter @xcite .",
    "a large number of studies have , in fact , demonstrated that particle models can be constructed to accommodate both the positron rise and the _ fermi _ `` feature '' ( for short , we will hereafter dub these two as the `` cosmic - ray anomalies '' ) , invoking either the pair - annihilation or the decay of dark matter particles ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a dark matter annihilation interpretation of the cosmic - ray anomalies requires a very large pair - annihilation cross section , one or more orders of magnitude larger ( depending on the dark matter particle mass ) than the one that would explain via thermal decoupling the observed universal matter density @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of the thermal relic dark matter scenario must therefore be traded - off , within this scenario , for large annihilation rates in today s cold universe , unless a very strong velocity dependence in the annihilation cross - section is invoked , ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dark matter decay as the source of the cosmic - ray lepton anomalies , on the other hand , requires the fine - tuning of the decay time - scale @xmath3 , but is otherwise a phenomenologically perfectly viable scenario .",
    "the required lifetimes are on the order of a few @xmath6 s , for particle masses in the tev range .    in the broader picture of particle model - building , several scenarios predict that the symmetry that preserves the stability of the dark matter particle on scales much larger than the age of the universe is violated by sufficiently suppressed higher - dimension operators ( i.e. operators with mass - dimension greater than 4 ) that mediate the subsequent , slow particle decay . similarly to the generic prediction of proton decay , in the context of supersymmetric grand unification , operators with mass dimension 6 are expected to make supersymmetric dark matter unstable , with a natural time - scale @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy scale of grand unification interactions , as recently pointed out by @xcite and , subsequently , by @xcite .",
    "interestingly this yields the prediction @xmath9 which is precisely in the ballpark needed to explain the cosmic - ray anomalies .",
    "notice that gut - suppressed dimension-5 operators would produce lifetimes on the order of a second @xcite , and must thus be suppressed to avoid dark matter decaying long before structure formation .",
    "in addition to grand unification , another compelling reason to expect dark matter to decay with a lifetime on the order of @xmath10 s is provided by models , such as those elucidated in the analysis of @xcite , where the lightest supersymmetric particle is a gravitino and @xmath11-parity is ( very weakly ) broken ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this class of models , not only is the supersymmetric gravitino problem naturally solved , but the correct baryon asymmetry can naturally be generated by @xmath11-parity violating interactions via leptogenesis .",
    "another scenario that might in principle combine the origin of both the baryonic matter and the dark matter via leptogenesis , and provide a mechanism to explain neutrino masses and mixing is that of sterile neutrinos ( for a review see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent analyses also pointed to hidden - sector gauge bosons and gauginos as natural particle frameworks where tev - scale particle dark matter decays with lifetimes on the order of @xmath6 s. a scenario featuring leptonic decay final states and a sufficiently long - lived dark matter as a consequence of a global symmetry broken by instanton operators originating from a non - abelian gauge group in the dark sector was also discussed in @xcite .    if the decay of particle dark matter is to explain the cosmic - ray lepton anomalies , the required dominant decay final state must be close to one ( or more ) muon pairs , as shown e.g. in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , among many of the scenarios mentioned above , the decay products will likely follow hadronization chains that are typically well reproduced in their major features by decay final states such as a quark - antiquark pair ( even though for instance in the scenario of @xcite the final state might be that resulting from @xmath12 or @xmath13 decay , the hadronic decay modes would still produce a gamma - ray spectrum qualitatively similar to that of a quark - antiquark pair ; see also @xcite for a discussion of weak corrections to annihilation or decay final states ) .",
    "for this reason , in the present study we will focus on two specific decay final states : @xmath14 as representative of those scenarios that offer a particle dark matter decay interpretation to the cosmic - ray anomalies ; and @xmath15 for more conventional decaying dark matter scenarios .",
    "for these two decaying dark matter final states , we will consider in detail the produced gamma - ray spectrum as a function of the dark matter particle mass , and model this spectrum with the dmfit package @xcite as implemented in the _",
    "fermi_-lat data analysis pipeline .",
    "the consideration of different decay final states will be coupled to the choice of the best targets , as one particular target does not necessarily give the strongest constraints for all dark matter models .",
    "an important effect , as shown in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , is the diffusion of the high - energy electrons and positrons produced by dark matter decay . for sufficiently massive dark",
    "matter candidates , in fact , these particles copiously up - scatter low - energy background photons ( inverse compton  ic  emission ) into gamma rays detectable by the lat @xcite .",
    "the ic photon flux is however strongly dependent upon the electron diffusion and leakage out of the observed target , an effect that impacts both the spectrum and the predicted flux - intensity .",
    "we discuss this and other target - dependent considerations in the next section .",
    "a number of astrophysical targets are potentially good sources to search for a signal from dark matter annihilation or decay , including the galactic center , the milky way halo , nearby galaxies and dwarf spheroidal galaxies , nearby clusters of galaxies , and the summed contribution from unresolved extragalactic dark matter ( for a review in the context of the lat performance , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "underpinning which is the `` best '' target depends , however , on the type of signal ( annihilation or decay ) , on our understanding of the dark matter density in different objects , on the gamma - ray backgrounds , and on the dominant gamma - ray emission mechanism for a given dark matter particle model ( for instance prompt gamma - ray production versus secondary ic emission ) .",
    "extragalactic objects like clusters of galaxies and local group dwarf galaxies are particularly attractive targets for dark matter searches as they are highly dark matter dominated , isolated objects , and many of them lie in regions of low diffuse gamma - ray background , being located at high galactic latitudes . in addition , with the exception of m31 , the objects we discuss do not themselves host detectable gamma - ray emission , making them clean targets of study to constrain emission from dark matter .",
    "previous studies looking at constraints on dark matter models using _ fermi _ observations of dwarfs and clusters have focused on dark matter annihilation @xcite , while constraints on dark matter decay with _ fermi _ have primarily compared the observed diffuse gamma - ray backgrounds to the total summed emission expected from dark matter decay in the milky way halo or from unresolved extragalactic dark matter @xcite . in this paper , we constrain dark matter decay models using , instead , isolated extra - galactic dark matter sources , specifically nearby clusters , dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way , and the nearby galaxy m31 ( the andromeda galaxy ) . in some cases , these targets provide significantly stronger constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime than have been previously published , particularly for the case of nearby clusters ( see also the simulations of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive collapsed objects in the present - day universe and are highly dark matter dominated .",
    "apart from the central bright active galactic nuclei in a couple of clusters , clusters have thus far not been detected in gamma - rays , a fact that allows one to place limits on their possible dark matter related emission @xcite .",
    "we consider here the same sample of six , nearby clusters of galaxies as we studied in @xcite .",
    "these clusters are among the best candidates for dark matter searches and have published upper limits on their potential gamma - ray emission from dark matter ( annihilation ) based on the first 11 months of _",
    "fermi_-lat observations for two illustrative ( annihilation ) final states , @xmath15 and @xmath14 , and for a grid of dark matter particle masses .",
    "remarkably , the expected gamma - ray spectral shape from dark matter decay for a given particle mass is the same as the gamma - ray spectrum from annihilation for a particle of half the mass with the same assumed final state ( although certain final states can only be available to decay processes , such as e.g. @xmath12 plus charged leptons , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we use the corresponding flux upper limits from @xcite to take into account the spectral dependence of the broad - band _ fermi_-lat upper limits .",
    "clusters are particularly good targets when considering decay to leptons , as is the case for models fitting the cosmic - ray anomalies , because in this case much of the gamma - ray emission stems from ic scattering of background radiation by the energetic @xmath16 produced @xcite . in clusters ,",
    "@xmath16 lose energy through ic much faster than they can diffuse out of the system , unlike in smaller systems like dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat effective area is a strong function of energy and increases by nearly an order of magnitude from 100 mev to 1 gev , increasing more slowly at energies above 1 gev .",
    "in addition , the lat psf decreases with increasing energy ( effectively reducing the background for detection ) and the gamma - ray backgrounds are relatively soft .",
    "given the expected spectral shape for the dark matter decay models we consider , these facts mean that the tightest constraints come from the _ fermi _ data around @xmath17 gev ( for more detail see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at these energies the _ fermi_-lat point - spread function ( psf ) is around one degree , a radius which contains most of the virial mass of the clusters we consider .",
    "following @xcite , we assume an nfw profile for the cluster dark matter density distribution with cluster masses taken from @xcite and the concentration - mass relation of @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the expected gamma - ray flux from dark matter decay @xmath18 is    @xmath19    where we integrate the dark matter density @xmath20 along the line of sight ( l.o.s . ) in the direction @xmath21 over a solid angle @xmath22 corresponding to a radius of one degree .",
    "the @xmath18 values for our cluster sample are listed in table 1 along with the masses , radii , and concentrations we employ .",
    "the choice of density profile and integration radius only matters at the level of a factor of a few in the derived @xmath18 since , as already mentioned , the size of the _ fermi _ psf includes much of the cluster virial mass ( see column 6 of table 1 ) and since compared to annihilation , which is proportional to density squared , decay is relatively insensitive to the inner dark matter density profile .      local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies are very nearby objects which , in some cases , are even more dark matter dominated than clusters @xcite .",

    "if we relax our conservative assumptions on gamma - ray emission from high - energy muon pairs , the constraints shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : dwarfs ] become considerably stronger , as shown in figure [ fig : dwarfsys ] for ursa minor ( we employ this specific dwarf galaxy as it gives the strongest constraints among the dwarf sample ) . in the left panel of figure",
    "[ fig : dwarfsys ] , we consider the limits on the dark matter decay lifetime if we include the expected ic gamma - ray emission for a @xmath14 decay final state for different assumed diffusion coefficients .",
    "following @xcite , the blue lines show the constraints for diffusion coefficients of @xmath46 @xmath47 s@xmath48 ( dot - dashed line ) and @xmath49 @xmath47 s@xmath48 ( dashed line ) which bound the values found for the milky way . in both cases , the energy dependence of diffusion is assumed to have a power - law dependence given by @xmath50 .",
    "the red line shows the constraints in the limit of no diffusion ( i.e. in the limit where the electrons and positrons loose all of their energy via ic prior to diffusing away from the system ) .",
    "the inclusion of ic emission significantly strengthens the constraints from ursa minor , but for reasonable diffusion coefficients these are still weaker than previous limits on the decay lifetime .",
    "in addition for our nominal constraints in figure [ fig : dwarfs ] , we conservatively assumed dwarf masses equal to @xmath23 even though the dwarf half - light radii are smaller than 1 degree . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : dwarfsys ] , we compare the constraints for ursa minor for different assumptions on the mass profile . for illustration",
    "we show the limits on the decay lifetime for a @xmath14 final state with a diffusion coefficient of @xmath46 @xmath47 s@xmath48 , but of course the same relative offset also holds for other cases . employing the best - fit nfw profile parameters from fits to the stellar velocity data for ursa minor published in @xcite to calculate @xmath18 for a radius of 1 degree yields the dot - dashed line in figure [ fig : dwarfsys ] ( right panel ) , a factor of a few stronger than for @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite find that all of the milky way dwarf spheroidals are consistent with having the same total halo mass ( within the scatter ) of around @xmath51 m@xmath52 for a @xmath53cdm cosmology .",
    "looking for example at their figure 3 , for a range of two orders of magnitude in total halo mass between @xmath54 m@xmath52 and @xmath55 m@xmath52 and for an nfw profile consistent with a wmap5 cosmology , would give a mass within 1 degree for ursa minor between a few times @xmath56 m@xmath52 and a few times @xmath57 m@xmath52 .",
    "the decay constraints for this range of masses is reflected in the two dashed lines in figure [ fig : dwarfsys ] , where we show the results for the specific values of @xmath58 m@xmath52 and @xmath59 .",
    "depending on the assumptions on mass and diffusion , the ursa minor constraints become comparable to or stronger than previous limits .",
    "although faintly , the nearby spiral galaxy m31 is detected at gamma - ray frequencies , as recently reported by the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration @xcite .",
    "the detected gamma - ray emission is compatible with a point - source , although a slightly higher test - statistics was reported if a spatial template based on the infra - red surface brightness was employed @xcite . here , to set constraints on the emission from dark matter decay",
    "we simply consider the 2-@xmath60 upper limit on the observed emission , conservatively summing the statistical and systematic uncertainties quoted by the _ fermi_-lat collaboration .",
    "a more in - depth study would resort to either attempting to subtract the astrophysical emission from m31 as expected from cosmic - ray interaction with the inter - stellar medium ( in analogy to the diffuse gamma - ray emission from our own milky way ) , or to utilize , for instance , a region of interest that cuts out the gamma - ray emitting region ( e.g.  an annulus around the m31 central region ) .",
    "we defer such a study for a forthcoming analysis .",
    "m31 is an extremely interesting object to search for a signal from dark matter decay , as was for instance suggested , for the case of sterile neutrinos ( producing a monochromatic line at x - ray frequencies from the two - body decay into an active neutrino and a photon ) by @xcite . to estimate the object s brightness in gamma rays from dark matter decay",
    ", we employ the nfw dark matter density profile proposed by @xcite : table 1 shows that we obtain a @xmath18 value ( 1 degree radius ) for m31 which exceeds by almost a factor 2 the largest normalization factor for galaxy clusters , and by more than an order of magnitude the largest one we find among dwarf galaxies .    despite being a potentially extremely bright source of gamma rays from dark matter decay ,",
    "the constraints we derive from m31 are not as strong as those we found for clusters  the reason evidently being that m31 is actually detected as a gamma - ray source , and we conservatively do not attempt to subtract off any astrophysical background .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : m31 ] illustrates the constraints we obtain for a @xmath15 decay final state .",
    "the black line refers to the nfw profile with the gamma - ray flux obtained with the assumption of a point - like source and @xmath18 as listed in table 1 .",
    "the green dashed line assumes the isothermal profile of @xcite and the same gamma - ray flux limit  the closeness of the two lines illustrates the small uncertainty that stems from using two entirely different functional forms for the dark matter density profile .",
    "finally , for the blue dotted line we employ the extended source _ fermi_-lat flux and assume that the relevant mass coincides with the virial mass of m31 ( which we set to @xmath61 , from * ? ? ?",
    "the limits we obtain , while an improvement over what we get from dwarf galaxies and over previously available limits , are a factor of a few worse than those implied by the non - detection of galaxy clusters for the @xmath15 final state .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : m31 ] shows our results for the @xmath14 final state .",
    "we compare again with the regions favored by a dark matter decay interpretation of the cosmic - ray anomalies ( green and red shaded regions ) and with the current constraints ( grey region ) .",
    "the black lines refer to the nfw plus point - like source assumption , while the red lines refer to the case where we employ the virial mass and the extended source gamma - ray flux .",
    "given the relevance of diffusion for cosmic - ray electrons and positrons in the milky way , we do expect leakage of secondary @xmath16 out of m31 as well , and we model this process again in analogy to our own galaxy . we show with solid lines our results for the relatively small diffusion coefficient @xmath62 @xmath47/s , and with dashed lines the more conservative case of @xmath63 @xmath47/s ( as for dwarf galaxies , we set the rigidity dependence power to 1/3 ) . in either case",
    ", the limits we obtain do not improve over previous constraints nor do they approach the phenomenologically relevant regions for the cosmic - ray anomalies .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed how early _ fermi _ limits on the gamma - ray flux from clusters of galaxies , from nearby dwarf galaxies and the _ fermi _ detection of m31 impact the possible lifetime of a meta - stable particle dark matter .",
    "we showed that limits from dwarf galaxies and from m31 improve over previous constraints , for certain ranges of masses and final states .",
    "the best limits are however derived in the case of galaxy clusters , where we obtain an improvement of about a factor of five on the allowed decay lifetime for hadronic decay final states for a wide range of particle dark matter masses between 10 gev and 1 tev .",
    "furthermore , models where dark matter decays into muon pairs and explains the so - called cosmic - ray anomalies ( the positron excess reported by pamela and the feature observed by _",
    "fermi _ in the electron - positron spectrum ) are found to over - produce gamma rays from clusters of galaxies compared to _ fermi _ observations for large regions of the best - fitting parameter space .",
    "while we can not completely exclude the possibility , our results imply that the dark matter decay interpretation of the cosmic - ray anomalies is in tension with gamma ray observations , especially if both the _ fermi _ and pamela anomalies are jointly explained , and this scenario may be ruled out completely if fermi does not detect gamma - ray emission from clusters in the next few years .",
    "_ fermi_-lat continues to take data in all - sky survey mode , and in the future longer exposures and a better understanding of the astrophysical backgrounds will continue to improve constraints on dark matter models and perhaps even reveal a signal from this elusive component of the universe .",
