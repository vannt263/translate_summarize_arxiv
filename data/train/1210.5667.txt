    "neutron stars are fascinating objects of study for theoretical physics because their densities are many times greater than that of matter found on earth ( imagine a boeing 747 compressed to a grain of sand ) , and rather little is known about their inner structure and their properties . due to this lack of knowledge , physicists have to speculate using theoretical models . for a given equation of state ( eos ) , there are structure equations known as tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations which relate the mass and radius of a neutron star . the equation of state is related to and depends upon the composition of the neutron star .",
    "the problem at hand is to find an equation of state that , when supplemented with the tov equations , models the structure of a neutron star .    to solve this problem",
    ", we try different equations of state to model neutron stars .",
    "since the composition of neutron stars is not uniform , multiple equations of state `` stitched together '' are required to maintain accuracy and validity .",
    "for example , a neutron star is known to have two distinguishable layers of crust and a nuclear matter core .",
    "it is generally accepted that a neutron star has an outer crust , an inner crust , a nuclear matter core , and likely a quark matter core .",
    "the composition of a neutron star is vital to modeling a neutron star , and intuitively affects the equation of state .",
    "we first consider the composition of the star , and their corresponding eoss .",
    "then , we calculate the threshold pressures for the phase transitions between different types of matter that make up a neutron star .",
    "thus , we have a comprehensive equation of state that is valid and defined throughout the star .",
    "finally , we solve the tov equations using the comprehensive eos to produce a graph relating the mass and radius of a neutron star .",
    "one question we seek to answer is whether quark matter can exist in the core of a neutron star , whilst achieving a maximum mass that is greater than 2 solar masses in light of the discovery of pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 , which has been observed to be @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the discovery of the pulsar sets a lower limit to the maximum mass for a neutron star , as pictured in figure 3 of the paper by demorest et al . [ 3 ] .",
    "many theoretical equations of state can be ruled out simply from this criterion .",
    "the central density of neutron stars is known to be 5 to 10 times higher than the nuclear density , so baryonic matter ( such as neutrons and protons ) should become quark matter . however , previous research has shown that quark matter renders an equation of state to be `` softer '' , ie . to have a lower maximum mass .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see whether an eos with quark matter is still viable . in the quark matter equation of state",
    "there are a few constants that can be manipulated to fit the 2-solar - mass condition [ 1 ] . in this research",
    "it is shown that one of the manipulable parameters more significantly affects the maximum mass value relative to the other parameters .",
    "the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff equations are structure equations used to relate the mass and radius of a neutron star .",
    "it is worth noting that the tov equations can be solved completely once we establish @xmath1 , or the equation of state .",
    "one can consider a neutron star as a fluid under gravitational pressure .",
    "in other words , the upper layers of the star compress the lower layers ; therefore , the pressure and density are greatest at the center . for a newtonian system",
    ", mathematically one can establish that such system could be described by @xmath2 . in dwarf stars and other stars",
    "less massive than neutron stars , it is usually permissible to ignore relativistic effects because they are negligible and simply use the newtonian relationship . for neutron stars ,",
    "however , it is necessary to make corrections ; for example , the intuitive equation @xmath2 must be corrected to become equation 1 . in astrophysics ,",
    "the set of equations to model the physical structure of spherically symmetric stars in hydrostatic equilibrium is called the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations .",
    "the set of tov equations incorporate general relativistic effects due to the immense density of a neutron star .",
    "we apply them to find the mass and radius of a neutron star given an equation of state ( discussed later in this paper ) , which is dictated by the composition of the neutron star .",
    "derived from einstein s equations of general relativity , the tov equations are    @xmath3\\left[m(r)+4\\pi r^{3}\\frac{p(r)}{c^{2}}\\right]\\left[1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{c^{2}r}\\right]^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the pressure at @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the mass density at @xmath6 , @xmath8 is the mass enclosed by the sphere of radius @xmath6 .",
    "the former equation refers to the hydrostatic equilibrium and the latter describes mass balance .",
    "these equations , when appended with an equation of state ( relating the pressure and density ) @xmath1 , can be solved for @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , the last of which provides information about the maximum mass , given an equation of state .",
    "it is straightforward to note that inside the star , @xmath9 and the pressure decreases monotonically as we move away from the center .",
    "the boundary conditions needed to solve the tov equations are @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ( unknown ) central density , and @xmath12 mass of neutron star , where @xmath13 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "the central density value affects the mass and corresponding radius of a neutron star . by varying the central density ,",
    "the maximum mass of neutron stars can be found for a given equation of state .",
    "in the previous section , we alluded to the missing component that needs to supplement the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff equations in order to solve them and find the mass - radius relationship .",
    "an equation of state is most usually in the functional form @xmath1 relating the pressure and the mass density .",
    "if for a given density @xmath14 an eos can sustain a larger pressure , then the eos is considered `` harder '' and produce a larger maximum mass .",
    "the opposite is true for a `` softer '' eos .",
    "equations of state vary depending on the composition of a neutron star .",
    "thus , the equations of state required are distinct for different distances @xmath6 from the center . for example , a neutron star s equation of state will differ at the outer crust , inner crust , and at various depths of the core .",
    "the most interesting eos , which is unknown , is at the densest part of the core , the composition of which we can only speculate .",
    "the speculations on the composition of the core revolve around meeting certain observational restraints , such as maximum mass values .",
    "for example , an equation of state that produces a maximum mass less than 2 solar masses is essentially ruled out .      at the lowest densities of the neutron star",
    ", we find the outer crust .",
    "it is mostly made up of atomic nuclei .",
    "the equation of state of the outer crust is well - known and has been tabulated by haensel and pichon ( 1994 ) .",
    "given the set of tabulated data @xmath15 , we can use mathematica or similar computational software to interpolate the data points into an approximate function for @xmath1 .",
    "the tabulated equation of state for the outer crust is provided from pressures @xmath16 dyn @xmath17 to @xmath18 dyn @xmath17 in an eos table from the book by haensel et al [ 7 ] . for pressures less than @xmath16 dyn @xmath17",
    "we safely ignore those @xmath15 points because the mass contribution relative to the overall mass is negligible .",
    "the next phase of the neutron star , at pressures above @xmath19 dyn @xmath17 , is the inner crust , composed of a plasma of nuclei and electrons .",
    "the inner crust has a characteristic abundance of neutron - rich nuclei in a `` neutron fluid '' of free neutrons that have dripped from nuclei .",
    "this neutron fluid differentiates the inner crust from the outer crust .",
    "roughly the same computational steps apply here , where we take the tabulated results for @xmath15 from the sly inner crust eos model seen in table 3 of douchin & haensel ( 2001 ) [ 4 ] and interpolate using software to produce an equation of state .",
    "the pressure values for this stage are roughly from @xmath19 dyn @xmath17 to @xmath20 dyn @xmath17 .",
    "nuclei can not exist at densities above @xmath21 g @xmath22 [ 7 ] which corresponds to roughly to the pressure @xmath23 dyn @xmath17 ; at such high densities , nuclei become a plasma of mostly neutrons and some protons . in the inner crust , protons clustered to form nuclei . in the core ,",
    "it is energetically favourable for protons to not cluster , hence the plasma of neutrons and protons instead of nuclei .",
    "the precise calculation of the equation of state at this phase is a difficult problem .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculations is larger in the core than in the crust , simply because the matter in the core is at much higher densities than anything observed .    for the neutron core",
    ", we use the eos provided by gandolfi et al [ 5 ] .",
    "the results of their quantum monte carlo method ( qmc ) , a sophisticated and accurate calculation , can be parametrized by @xmath24 the energy per particle of neutron matter    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the ( neutron ) number density , coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are sensitive for the low density range of the equation of state , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 for higher densities . here",
    "the nuclear saturation density @xmath31 @xmath22 .",
    "there are a few options for the coefficients , based on different ways of calculating the three - body 3n interactive forces which contribute to the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "we shall use the parameters of urbana ix ( uix ) : @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 mev , @xmath34 , @xmath35 [ 5 ] .    from the energy per particle @xmath24 we can calculate the chemical potential per particle for",
    "the neutron core @xmath36    @xmath37    and finally calculate the pertinent two equation of state quantities : the neutron matter mass density @xmath38 and pressure @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the mass of a neutron and @xmath43 is the speed of light in a vacuum [ 5 ] .",
    "the equation of state function @xmath1 is clearly parameterized by the variable @xmath26 , and by evaluating both eq . 5 and eq .",
    "6 for a large range of values for @xmath26 , say from @xmath44 to @xmath45 we can obtain the equation of state for the hadronic part of the core .",
    "lastly , at the densest part of the core , the physical composition is still unknown . it has been predicted that at high enough density , the nucleic and neutron matter becomes a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) [ 2 ] .",
    "however , the exact transition point ( threshold for phase change ) is not known .",
    "the eos of quark matter has a different form than that of neutron matter .",
    "since we are working with qgp , we avoid using number density as a parameter because there are no neutrons in quark matter . instead , we can use the chemical potential @xmath46 as the parameter .",
    "we define the energy density @xmath47 for the quark matter core as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a constant parameter and @xmath50 are the number of colours and flavours of the quark matter , respectively [ 1 ] .",
    "@xmath51 is known as the bag constant .",
    "now , we define the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath52 which form the basis for the quark matter equation of state [ 1 ] :    @xmath53    @xmath54    again , the equation of state function @xmath1 can be obtained by evaluating equations 8 and 9 for various values of @xmath46 .",
    "recall that there are three parameters @xmath55,@xmath56 and @xmath51 that we have yet to define .",
    "theorists essentially try to change these parameters to fit observations such as the two - solar - mass maximum mass requirement which is discussed in the next section .",
    "we can roughly estimate the order of magnitude of these parameters , but the precise calculation is difficult .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to experiment with a few values within a reasonable range to understand the properties of quark matter .",
    "a set of values for these parameters is also provided in the next section to illustrate the effects of the parameters on the resulting graphs .",
    "thus , the eos for the quark matter is an unsolved problem .",
    "given all the equations of state @xmath1 that cover all the values of pressure possible within a neutron star , the theoretical neutron star model is then constructible using the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff equations . for pressure values between @xmath16 dyn @xmath17 and @xmath20 dyn @xmath17 , we easily use the well - defined equations of state of the outer crust and inner crust . for the crust to core phase transition",
    ", we use the condition that the pressure is the same at the transition for the crust eos and core eos .",
    "the density of the core at the crust - core interface is around @xmath57 .    for the core transition between neutron matter ( nm ) to quark matter ( qm ) , we consider two possibilities .",
    "first that there is no transition to quark matter ( represented by dashed red line in the figures ) . for the second case",
    "that there is a transition into a qm core , we need to find the phase transition between nm and qm .",
    "the procedure for determining the boundary pressure between the nm eos and qm eos is two - fold .",
    "firstly , let us note that @xmath58 mev)/3 where @xmath59 is the chemical potential of the neutron core at the same boundary pressure value , for some number density @xmath60 .",
    "so the first condition is that the chemical potential of the quark matter at the boundary pressure @xmath61 must equal ( @xmath62 - 938 mev)/3 .",
    "the rest mass of a neutron is 938 mev .",
    "secondly , the pressure value calculated by equation 6 @xmath63 must equal @xmath64 from equation 9 .",
    "we now consider the coordinates @xmath65@xmath66 and @xmath67938 mev)/3@xmath68 . since @xmath60 is defined to be such that @xmath67938 mev)/3 @xmath69 ( condition 1 ) , and @xmath70 ( condition 2 ) , the phase transition occurs where @xmath65@xmath66 is equal to @xmath71 mev)/3@xmath68 . to find such coinciding coordinates , we can graph @xmath65@xmath66 for various values of @xmath61 and graph @xmath67938 mev)/3@xmath68 for various values of @xmath60 .",
    "then , if @xmath65@xmath66 is equal to @xmath67938 mev)/3@xmath68 , then the threshold pressure value between the neutron core and the quark core is @xmath72 .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , there are a few unknown parameters which make the quark matter eos uncertain .",
    "recall that there were three undefined parameters @xmath55,@xmath56 and @xmath51 for the quark matter core .",
    "let us try with the following definitions :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      recall equation 1 of the tov equations .",
    "there are terms @xmath7 that are unknown without an equation of state and prevent the solving of the tov equations . now with a complete all - in - one equation of state , as well as the threshold pressure for the phase transition between qm and nm , we fully know @xmath1 so we can write @xmath7 as @xmath73 .",
    "the tov equation becomes @xmath74\\left[m(r)+4\\pi r^{3}\\frac{p(r)}{c^{2}}\\right]\\left[1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{c^{2}r}\\right]^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath75    the two functions @xmath5 and @xmath8 can be solved by mathematica easily , if we know @xmath10 and @xmath76 , which is the central pressure .",
    "since the central pressure is unknown , and the value that we give to @xmath76 affects the solving of the functions @xmath5 and @xmath8 , we will get a distinct neutron star with a unique mass and radius for every distinct value we assign to the central pressure .",
    "so if we wanted to find the maximal mass possible for any neutron star given our set of equations of state , we simply need to try a wide range of central pressure values and see which one generates a neutron star with highest mass .",
    "the graph generated from computing such maximum mass is seen in figure 2 .",
    "this tov - solving procedure is done for the case in which we do not have quark matter in the core ( dashed red ) , as well as for the 4 different types of quark matter .",
    "figure 2 : the mass vs. radius graph shows the maximum mass possible for the different equations of state .",
    "the highest valued maximum mass belongs the equation of state without quark matter ( dashed red ) , which clearly shows that quark matter in the core `` softens '' the overall eos .",
    "the next highest valued maximum mass corresponds to the equation of state that has quark matter with the parameters of d ) in table 1 ( black ) . in general , to interpret the mass vs. radius graphs such as figure 2 , the central density value @xmath11 used to solve the tov equations increases as you follow the curves from right to left .",
    "one of the more recent neutron star discoveries was that of the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 , the mass of which was determined to be @xmath0 using shapiro delay calculations by demorest et .",
    "this revived interest in the research on the equations of state that met the mass measurement of the psr j1614 - 2230 , and eliminated many possible equation of state candidates .",
    "in other words , the discovery of the two - solar - mass neutron star became a new benchmark for testing the validity of a given equation of state .",
    "one of the prominent questions that emerged was whether a hybrid equation of state with quark matter like the one described in this paper would meet the two - solar - mass criterion .",
    "the doubt arises from the fact that quark matter equation of state is a `` softer '' eos , meaning it produces a smaller maximum mass compared to any eoss such as the neutron core eos .    as we can see from figure 2 above",
    ", the hybrid equations of state with the softer quark matter eoss mostly produce maximum masses that do not seem to meet the psr j1614 - 2230 two - solar - mass criterion , whereas the eos without quark matter easily reaches 2.5@xmath77 .",
    "the most interesting hybrid eos that still gives quark matter in the core is the one given the parameters of d ) in table 1 , which is represented in figure 1 and figure 2 in black .",
    "this eos with @xmath78 ( 150 mev@xmath79 and @xmath80 mev produces a maximum mass that safely meets the 2-solar - mass criterion .",
    "the other three quark eoss do not meet the 2-solar - mass criterion .",
    "both the blue and green mass vs radius curves ( corresponding to parameters a ) and b ) respectively ) have a maximum mass of around 1.5@xmath77 .",
    "the dark yellow curve , which uses parameters c ) , is even closer at roughly 1.85@xmath77 these chosen values for the parameters were inspired by alford et .",
    "al in their paper [ 1 ] .",
    "we can draw some strong conclusions simply from these five curves representing four quark hybrid eoss and one quark - free hybrid eos .",
    "the blue and green parameters suggest that the @xmath56 parameter does not affect the maximum mass significantly .",
    "the blue curve uses @xmath81 , while the green curve uses @xmath82 ( 150 mev@xmath79 . yet",
    ", there is no practical difference in the maximum mass between the blue and the green curves .",
    "parameter @xmath56 mainly affects where nm transitions to qm in the core .",
    "the green curve has a much higher threshold pressure for the phase transition from nm to qm : the blue curve transitions at 2.11e34 dyn @xmath17 while the green curve transitions at 8.651e34 dyn @xmath17 .",
    "the main distinction between the dark yellow curve and the blue and green curves is that the dark yellow curve has the parameter @xmath83 , while the blue and green curves have @xmath84 .",
    "so this result strongly suggests that the @xmath55 parameter is highly relevant in determining the maximum mass of a neutron star with quark matter at its core . to further support this conjecture , we consider the black curve , produced with the set of parameters d ) .",
    "the black curve uses the same value for @xmath56 and @xmath85 as the dark yellow curve .",
    "the only value for which they differ is for @xmath55 : black uses @xmath86 while dark yellow uses @xmath83 .",
    "this supports the thought that the lower the @xmath55 parameter , the higher the maximum mass .",
    "so it would seem intuitive to simply use a relatively low @xmath55 parameter value and expect to get a hybrid eos with quark matter to produce a maximum mass value of at least 2-solar masses . however , this intuitive hypothesis is not exactly true .",
    "when we try a lower @xmath55 parameter , the @xmath64 curves seen in figure 1 may not intersect reasonably , thus we would not have a defined phase transition . with the knowledge that the @xmath55 parameter most significantly affects the maximum mass value for a given eos , it will be worth looking into whether we can manipulate @xmath56 and @xmath51 such that the @xmath64 curves do intersect with the @xmath63 curve thus establishing the phase transition threshold pressure .",
    "so far we have found one set of parameters that meet the two - solar - mass criterion . with the knowledge that the @xmath55 parameter is important , further research may shed light on precisely calculating the parameters and finding the corresponding equations of state .",
    "i thank dr . rishi sharma from triumf laboratory for particle and nuclear physics for his mentorship , advice and infinite support in this research project .",
    "i also thank the canadian young scientist journal for their support by accepting this paper for publication in the february 2013 issue ."
