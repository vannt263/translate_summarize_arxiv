    "the hoffmeister family was identified in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite with a family identification number ( fin ) equal to 519 . as originally observed by novakovi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , this family is characterized by its interaction with the @xmath0 nodal secular resonance with ceres , whose effect is to significantly spread the distribution in inclination of family members for semi - major axis lower than @xmath6  au . @xcite",
    "also identified this family as one of the eight groups characterized by having the most leptokurtic distribution of the @xmath1 component of terminal ejection velocities field , that is closely related to the inclination through the third gauss equation ( see , for instance , eq .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "while most families are formed with an originally leptokurtic distribution of ejection velocities ( see @xcite for an explanation of the role that escape velocities from parent body have in creating originally leptokurtic distributions of terminal ejection velocities ) , in the absence of dynamical mechanisms able to change the inclination of family members , the distribution of @xmath1 tends in time to become more mesokurtic , or gaussian .",
    "this , however , is not the case for the hoffmeister family , whose interaction with the @xmath0 nodal secular resonance significantly shaped its inclination distribution .",
    "the peculiar nature of the hoffmeister family allows for the use of techniques of family dating not available for other asteroid groups .",
    "in particular , the study of the time behavior of the kurtosis of the @xmath1 component of the ejection velocity field ( @xmath2 ) , as performed by @xcite for the astrid , gallia , barcelona , and hansa families , could provide invaluable constraints on the family age and on the @xmath3 parameter describing the standard deviation of the initial ejection velocity field , assumed as gaussian . by observing by what time",
    "the current value of @xmath2 is reached , for fictitious hoffmeister families with different values of @xmath3 , and by imposing constraints on the most likely value of this parameter , based on the current inclination distribution of the part of the hoffmeister family not affected by the @xmath0 secular resonance , we can then obtain constraints on both the most likely values of family age and @xmath3 , not available for regular families .",
    "as a first step in our analysis , we selected the ( 1726 ) hoffmeister family , as identified in @xcite using the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm , @xcite ) and a cutoff of 45  m / s .",
    "1819 members of the hoffmeister dynamical group were identified in that work .",
    "@xcite identified 1905 members of the hoffmeister family , with an @xmath7 and @xmath8 distribution very similar to that observed for the @xcite group . for the sake of consistency , in this work we will use the data from @xcite , but we will discuss any significant difference with results from @xcite , when appropriate . using the criteria defined in @xcite we defined as objects in the local background of the hoffmeister family as those with synthetic proper elements , 2016 .",
    "] , whose values of proper @xmath9 and @xmath10 are in a range from the family barycenter to within four standard deviations of the observed distribution for the hoffmeister family , namely from 0.0300 to 0.071 in proper @xmath9 and from 0.054 to 0.102 in @xmath10 .",
    "the minimum value of proper @xmath11 was chosen from the minimum value of hoffmeister members minus 0.02 au , the averaged expected orbital mobility caused by close encounters with massive asteroids over 4 byr @xcite .",
    "the maximum @xmath11 value was taken at the center of the 5j:-2a mean - motion resonance .",
    "namely , this corresponds to an interval in @xmath11 from 2.730 au to 2.825 au .",
    "overall , we found 4781 asteroids in the local background of the hoffmeister family so defined , also including known members of other families .",
    "@xcite , in his analysis of the ( 363 ) padua family found that the main asteroid families in the local background of the hoffmeister cluster are the ( 847 ) agnia and padua groups , both characterized by their interaction with the @xmath12 secular resonance @xcite .",
    "this analysis was essentially confirmed by @xcite .",
    "apart from the cited agnia and padua families , these authors also identified the ( 2732 ) witt family at higher inclinations .",
    "other families in the region , such as the groups of ( 128 ) nemesis , ( 1668 ) hanna , and ( 1222 ) tina , do not have family members in the local background of hoffmeister defined according to our criteria . concerning the two major other families in the region , padua and agnia , despite some difference in terms of family membership between the nesvorn and milani groups for the padua family , that has 1087 and 864 members in these two classifications respectively , the corresponding distributions in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 planes are similar",
    ". the only significant difference in the distribution in the @xmath8 plane for the two padua families is that the nesvorn group has a small population of objects at @xmath15  au not visible in the milani group .",
    "the case of the agnia family is a bit more problematic .",
    "this family has 3033 members in milani et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and only 2125 members in nesvorn et al .",
    "most of the difference in family memberships is caused by the presence of multi - opposition objects in the milani group , that are not accounted for in the nesvorn family .",
    "also , the milani agnia family extends beyond the 3 - 1 - 1 three - body resonance , while the nesvorn one does not .",
    "quite interestingly , @xcite and @xcite identify the ( 3395 ) jitka sub - family inside the agnia family , that is quite distinguished in term of physical properties from the rest of the agnia family , and that will be further discussed in the next section .",
    "these differences in family memberships for the agnia and , in a lesser measure , the padua groups can a bit affect the determination of the local background , but should not change our overall conclusions . therefore , since there is a good agreement between the two hoffmeister families , in terms of family membership and other properties , in this work we will use the families as determined in @xcite .            after removing members of the padua , agnia , and witt groups , the local background consisted of 1721 objects .",

    "a significant fraction of hoffmeister members ( about 3% ) reached values of inclination large enough to allow for capture into the @xmath12 resonance .",
    "we expect that some of the past members of the hoffmeister family could have been drawn to the region of the padua family and be current interlopers of that group .",
    "after revising the effect of the local dynamics , we now turn our attention to the taxonomic properties of local objects . @xcite",

    "concerning objects in the background of the hoffmeister family , as defined in this section , we found 287 objects with photometric data in the sloan digital sky survey - moving object catalog data , fourth release ( sdss - moc4 hereafter , @xcite ) in thi s region , 71 of which are members of the hoffmeister dynamical family .",

    "as can be seen from the figure , the hoffmeister family is compatible with a c - type composition , the padua family was probably originated from the break - up of an x - type asteroid , and most of the members of the agnia family are s - type , which also confirms the analysis of @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , the jitka sub - family in the agnia family",
    "is characterized by higher albedo values than that of the rest of the family .",
    "while most of agnia members have @xmath28 , members of the jitka sub - family have @xmath29 .",
    "the witt family , not visible in the figure , is a s - type group . the mean albedo value for the hoffmeister , padua , and agnia family is of @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .            concerning halo objects , in the local background of the hoffmeister family only the hoffmeister family itself",
    "is associated with a c - type composition .",
    "it is reasonable therefore to conclude that the 95 asteroids with a sdss - moc4 c - type compatible composition in the region ( see fig .  [ fig : backround_sdss_wise ] could all be potentially associated with the hoffmeister family .",
    "c - type objects in the region of the padua family could be potential former members of the hoffmeister family that reached this region with the mechanism of dynamical diffusion ( capture in the @xmath0 resonance and then in the @xmath12 ) discussed in the previous section . if we consider the albedo data , fig .",

    "vertical red dashed lines show the 1-sigma range of albedo values for the hoffmeister family .",
    "there is a region of overlapping for asteroids belonging to the hoffmeister and padua family , ( at 1-sigma level the padua family covers the range of @xmath32 , so that it is not possible to distinguish objects originating from one of these two families only based on albedo ( the contribution from the agnia family in this 1-sigma interval is essentially negligible ) . if we limit our data to asteroid in the 1-sigma @xmath25 interval ( @xmath33 , fig .",
    "[ fig : wise_halo ] , panel b ) , then we can safely conclude that objects at inclination lower than that of the hoffmeister barycenter should be most likely originate from this family .",
    "however , no conclusion could be safely reached for objects at higher inclinations .",
    "@xcite estimate the age of the hoffmeister family to be @xmath34 myr , while @xcite , using a v - shape criteria , evaluate the family to be @xmath35 myr old , and found no asymmetry between the left and right side of the family semi - major axis distribution , concerning the estimation of the group age . as discussed in @xcite monte carlo methods @xcite that simulates the evolution of the family caused by the yarkovsky and yorp effects , where yorp stands for yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack effect ,",
    "could also be used to obtain estimates of the age and terminal ejection velocities of the family members ( these models will be referred as `` yarko - yorp '' models hereafter )",
    ".    however , the age estimates from these methods depend on key parameters describing the strength of the yarkovsky force , such as the thermal conductivity @xmath36 and bulk and surface density @xmath37 and @xmath38 , that are in many cases poorly known . before attempting our own estimate of the family age and terminal ejection velocity field , here we analyze what constraints could be obtained on the possible values of terminal ejection velocities of the original hoffmeister family from its current inclination distribution .",
    "assuming , in first approximation , that the original ejection velocity field of the hoffmeister family could be approximated as isotropic ( see @xcite for a discussion of the caveats on this hypothesis ) , we can model the distribution of ejection velocities of asteroids with a gaussian distribution whose standard deviation follows the relationship :    @xmath39    where @xmath3 is the terminal ejection velocity parameter to be estimated , and @xmath40 is the asteroid diameter .",
    "@xcite estimated that the ratio of the radius of the parent body with that of the largest fragment was of 0.14 , which yields an estimate of 90.85 km for the parent body diameter , and an escape velocity of 39.6  m / s , assuming a mean density for the parent body of 1300  kg / m@xmath41 , typical of c - type asteroids .",
    "if we only consider objects with @xmath42  au , so as to eliminate the asteroids that interacted with the @xmath43 resonance , then the currently observed minimum and maximum values of @xmath10 of family members are 0.0742 and 0.0782 , respectively . neglecting possible changes in @xmath10 after the family formation , which is motivated by the fact that the local dynamics does not seems to particularly affect asteroids in this region",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : map_ai_cpv ] ) , these values set constraints on the possible terminal ejection velocity parameter @xmath3 with which the family was created .",

    "based on these considerations , it seems unlikely that the ejection velocity parameter @xmath3 was larger than @xmath47  m / s , or a larger number of asteroids outside the hoffmeister family at @xmath42  au would be visible today .",
    "as previously discussed , the hoffmeister family is one of the seven families identified in @xcite as being characterized by having a very leptokurtic distribution in the orthogonal component @xmath1 of the currently estimated terminal ejection velocities , and , therefore , of the asteroid inclinations . as observed in sect .",
    "[ sec : fam_ide ] , this is mainly caused by the interaction of this family with the @xmath0 secular resonance that strongly affects the distribution in proper inclination of family members at lower values of semi - major axis , and , therefore , their @xmath1 values .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated how the time evolution of @xmath1 values could be used to set constraints on the initial values of the @xmath3 parameter for the astrid family using the same approach , here we simulated fictitious hoffmeister families with the currently observed size - frequency distribution , values of the parameters affecting the strength of the yarkovsky force typical of c - type asteroids according to @xcite , i.e. , bulk and surface density equal to @xmath48  kg / m@xmath41 , thermal conductivity @xmath49   w / m / k , thermal capacity equal to @xmath50  j / kg / k , bond albedo @xmath51 and infrared emissivity @xmath52 .",
    "the fictitious families had values of @xmath53 , and @xmath54  m / s , the most likely values of this parameter , according to the analysis of the previous section ( values of @xmath3 larger or equal to 25  m / s were deemed to be incompatible with the current inclination distribution of the hoffmeister family at large @xmath11 ) .",
    "particles were integrated with @xmath55 , the symplectic integrator developed by @xcite that simulates the diurnal and seasonal versions of the yarkovsky effect , over 400 myr and the gravitational influence of all major planets plus ceres .",

    "results from @xcite show that the shape of the @xmath1 distribution is generally not strongly dependent on the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , except for values of @xmath60 close to @xmath62 ( which does not seems to be the case for the hoffmeister family , since these values would have produced a very small inclination distribution ) .",

    "we will try to further refine our family age estimate .",
    "now that the analysis of the current inclination distribution and our @xmath66 test provided independent constraint on the values of the @xmath3 parameter , we can try to obtain an independent age estimate for this family .",

    "more details on the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "essentially , the semi - major axis distribution of simulated asteroid families is evolved under the influence of the yarkovsky effect ( both diurnal and seasonal version ) , the stochastic yorp force , and changes in values of the past solar luminosity .",
    "distributions of a @xmath67-target function are then obtained through the equation :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the asteroid absolute magnitude , and @xmath70 is the distance of each asteroid from its family center , here defined as the family center of mass . for the hoffmeister family",
    "this is essentially equal to the semi - major axis of 1726 hoffmeister itself .",

    "good values of the @xmath76 function are close to the number of the degrees of freedom of the @xmath71-like variable .",
