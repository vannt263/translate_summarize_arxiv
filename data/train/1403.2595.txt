    "it is reasonable to expect that large - rapidity - distance jets are more decorrellated in azimuth than jets placed close in rapidity .",
    "about 25 years ago mueller and navelet predicted strong decorrelation in relative azimuthal angle @xcite of such jets due to exchange of the bfkl ladder between quarks ( partons ) .",
    "the generic picture is presented in diagram ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . in a bit",
    "simplified picture quarks / antiquarks / gluons are emitted forward and backward , whereas gluons emitted along the ladder populate rapidity regions in between . due to diffusion along the exchange ladder the correlation between the most forward and the most backward jets is small .",
    "this was a simple picture obtained within leading - logarithmic bfkl formalism @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite so - called consistency constrain was imposed in addition .",
    "recent higher - order bfkl calculation slightly modified this simple picture @xcite leading to smaller azimuthal decorrelation in rapidity .",
    "recently the nll corrections were calculated both to the green s function and to the jet vertices .",
    "the effect of the nll correction is large and leads to significant lowering of the cross section .",
    "so far only averaged values of @xmath4 over available phase space or even their ratios were studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies are necessary to verify this type of calculations . in particular",
    ", the approach should reproduce dependence on the rapidity distance between the jets emitted in opposite hemispheres and more detailed associated dependences on transverse momenta of the jets .",
    "large - rapidity - distance jets can be produced only at high energies where the rapidity span is large due to kinematics . a first experimental trial of search for the mn jets",
    "was made by the d0 collaboration @xcite . in their study rapidity distance between jets",
    "was limited to 5.5 units only .",
    "nonetheless they have observed a broadening of the @xmath5 distribution with growing rapidity distance between jets .",
    "however , theoretical interpretation of the broadening is not clear .",
    "the dijet azimuthal correlations were also studied in collinear next - to - leading order approximation @xcite .",
    "the lhc opens new possibility to study the decorrelation effect quantitatively .",
    "first experimental data measured at @xmath2 = 7 tev are expected soon @xcite .            on the other hand recent studies of multiparton interactions",
    "have shown that they may easily produce objects which are emitted far in rapidity .",
    "good example is production of @xmath6 @xcite or inclusive production of two @xmath7 mesons @xcite . here",
    "we wish to concentrate on four - jet double - parton scattering ( dps ) production with large distances between jets ( see diagram ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "several suggestions how to separate four - jet dps contribution from sps contribution at midrapidities were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the present first exploratory study we shall make first estimate of the dps effects for jets with large rapidity separation within leading - order collinear approximation . already this approximation will allow us to nicely illustrate the generic situation .",
    "we shall focus on distribution in rapidity distance of the most - rapidity - distant jets .",
    "the dps result will be compared to the distribution in rapidity distance for standard 2 @xmath8 2 single parton scattering ( sps ) pqcd dijet calculation .",
    "we shall identify the dominant partonic subprocesses important to understand the situation in the small but interesting corner of the phase space .",
    "the calculation of distributions in rapidity distance will be supplemented by the analysis of correlations in the two - dimensional space of the transverse momenta of the two widely separated jets or by calculation of distributions in transverse momentum imbalance of the jets or correlations in azimuthal angle between them .",
    "in the present calculation all partonic cross sections ( @xmath9 ) are calculated in leading - order only .",
    "the cross section for dijet production can be written then as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are rapidities of the two jets ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 is transverse momentum of one of them ( they are identical ) .",
    "the parton distributions are evaluated at @xmath16 and @xmath17 is used as factorization and renormalization scale .    in our calculations",
    "we include all leading - order @xmath9 partonic subprocesses ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath18-factor for dijet production is rather small , of the order of @xmath19 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but can be easily incorporated in our calculations .",
    "below we shall show that already the leading - order approach gives results in sufficiently reasonable agreement with recent atlas @xcite and cms @xcite data .",
    "this simplified leading - order approach can , however be , used conveniently in our first estimate of dps differential cross sections for jets widely separated in rapidity . in analogy to the production of @xmath6 ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) one can write : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and partons @xmath22 .",
    "the combinatorial factors include identity of the two subprocesses .",
    "each step of the dps is calculated in the leading - order approach ( see eq.([lo_sps ] ) ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 has dimension of cross section and has a simple interpretation in the impact parameter representation @xcite . above @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath24 , @xmath25",
    "are rapidities of partons in first and second partonic subprocess , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respective transverse momenta .    experimental data from the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite",
    "provide an estimate of @xmath23 in the denominator of formula ( [ dps ] ) .",
    "as in our recent paper @xcite we take @xmath23 = 15 mb . a detailed analysis of @xmath23 based on various experimental data can be found in refs .",

    "we have also shown some recent predictions of the mueller - navelet jets in the ll and nll bfkl framework from the literature .",
    "for the cms configuration our dps contribution is smaller than the sps dijet contribution even at high rapidity distances and only slightly smaller than that for the nll bfkl calculation known from the literature .",
    "the dps final state topology is clearly different than that for the sps dijets ( four versus two jets ) which may help to disentangle the two mechanisms experimentally .",
    "of course sps three- and four - jet final states should be included in more refined analyses of distributions in rapidity distance .",
    "we have shown that the relative effect of dps could be increased by lowering the transverse momenta of jets but such measurements can be difficult if not impossible . alternatively one could study correlations of semihard pions distant in rapidity .",
    "correlations of two neutral pions could be done , at least in principle , with the help of zero - degree calorimeters present at each main detectors at the lhc .",
    "this type of studies requires further analyses taking into account also hadronization effects .",
    "the dps effects are interesting not only in the context how they contribute to distribution in rapidity distance but _ per se_.",
    "one could make use of correlations in jet transverse momenta , jet imbalance and azimuthal correlations to enhance or lower the contribution of dps .",
    "further detailed monte carlo studies are required to settle real experimental program of such studies .",
