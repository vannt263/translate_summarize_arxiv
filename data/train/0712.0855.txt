    "we have explored two avenues for the _ ab initio _ calculations of nuclear - reaction properties starting from the nuclear structure of the ncsm  @xcite : i ) the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) approach  @xcite , and ii ) the resonating - group method ( rgm )  @xcite . in sect .",

    "@xcite , and the nnn interaction at the highest order presently available ( n@xmath3lo )  @xcite .",
    "the two low - energy constants that parameterize the short - range nnn interaction were selected as discussed in ref .",
    "the microscopic treatment of the continuum problem is achieved by means of the lit method , applied within the ncsm approach .",
    "accurate convergence of the ncsm expansions is reached using three - body effective interactions for both the nn and nnn terms of the potential .",
    "the results , presented in fig",

    "the experimental situation in the near - threshold region is controversial  @xcite : we find an overall good agreement with the photo - disintegration data from bremsstrahlung photons of nilsson et al . and the indirect measurements of nakayama et al .",

    "they can be determined by solving the many - body schrdinger equation in the hilbert space spanned by the basis functions ( [ rgm_basis ] ) : @xmath10\\varphi_{\\nu}(\\vec{r}\\,)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the full hamiltonian of the system , and the two integration kernels are defined as @xmath12    in the ncsm / rgm approach we use _ ab initio _ ncsm wave functions for each of the two clusters , and ncsm effective interactions derived from realistic forces .",
    "the most challenging task is to evaluate the hamiltonian and norm kernels : so far we have developed formalism for cluster states with a single - nucleon projectile and we have applied it to the scattering of low - energy neutrons on @xmath0he . in fig .",
