    "one of the most important definitions in euclidean geometry concerns the norm of a vector and the distance between two points : they are defined using the pythagoras theorem . in the xix century , riemann generalized ideas of gauss , introduced the concept of manifold and constructed the riemannian geometry , in which pythagoras theorem would be only valid at a point or along a line , but would no longer be the way of measuring distances in an open set in the manifold ; instead , such measure would be performed using a general metric field .",
    "euclidean geometry was the background of newtonian mechanics and was invariant by galilean boosts and rotations , but the advent of special relativity and a new kind of invariance group inspired the use of a geometry that unified space and time in a way that could keep invariant the interval between two events : such was minkowski geometry , in which the interval represents a distance in such spacetime , that is measured by a formula similar to the euclidean one , however allowing for positive , null or negative norms of vectors : this is a pseudo - euclidean space .",
    "the next generalization , that is responsible for a relativistic description of gravity was performed by einstein by writing general relativity using a generalization of the minkowski space by the same terms of the generalization from euclidean to riemannian geometry : spacetime was defined as a differential manifold endowed with a pseudo - riemannian metric .",
    "in the geometries just described , one uses a metric to define the norm of vectors and co - vectors and , then defines the length of curves and the distance between points .",
    "an important feature of special relativity that gains a geometrical interpretation is the dispersion relation of particles , _ i d est _ the equation that relates energy , momentum and mass , it is defined as the norm of the four - momentum in minkowski spacetime",
    ". therefore the pseudo - euclidean nature of the minkowski metric is what allows us to have a dispersion relation of the form @xmath0 .",
    "such relation can be generalized to a curved spacetime , where the dispersion relation is defined as the norm with the curved metric , and the minkowskian form is achieved in normal coordinates .",
    "on the other hand , some approaches to quantum gravity phenomenology refers to the possibility of having a modified dispersion relation ( mdr ) as a property of the semi - classical limit of quantum gravity theories , for example @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a deformation parameter that depends on the model ( which in some cases can be assumed to be proportional to the planck length @xcite ) .",
    "so , in this context , an immediate question arises : may a mdr be a manifestation of a departure of the riemannian nature of spacetime at a scale sensible for quantum gravity ?",
    "if the situation was the spacetime being non - riemannian in a sense that could afford for a non - quadratic norm of vectors , then we would have a mdr , but the inverse is not necessarily true , therefore we can only speculate about it .",
    "a known branch of differential geometry that fits perfectly into this property is the so called _ finsler geometry _ @xcite . basically , it is a rigorous formalization for possible non - quadratic norms of vectors , which is achieved through a four - velocity - dependent metric , but still preserving the parametrization invariance of the arc - length of curves in the manifold through the requirement of having a homogeneous in the velocities metric .",
    "the relations between finsler geometry and some approaches to the quantum gravity problem have been widely investigated @xcite , with special interest in models introducing some modification to particles dispersion relation ( see for instance ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , in @xcite girelli , et al . pointed out that phenomenological models that implement some kind of departure from lorentz symmetries can be systematically formalized within the framework of finsler geometry , hypothesizing that such a formalism may be also the correct mathematical framework to describe the so called  rainbow metrics \" approach @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear whether the introduction of momentum - dependent  rainbow \" metrics imposes some sort of breakdown of lorentz symmetry or otherwise they may be suitable for a scenario with a deformation of ( local ) spacetime symmetries through a deformed poincar group as in the deformed special relativity approach @xcite .",
    "this issue was preliminarily treated by the authors of ref.@xcite for what concerns the fate of spacetime symmetries in mdr - inspired finsler geometries and was explicitly considered in ref.@xcite , in which it was shown that it is possible to obtain a description of modified relativistic particle kinematics satisfying both finsler geometry and deformed special relativity prescriptions within the so called @xmath3-poincar framework @xcite , at least at first order in the deformation parameter @xmath4 , where ( in units such as @xmath5 ) we can expect @xmath6 to be of the order of planck scale @xmath7 .",
    "however satisfactory for what concerns the description of particles kinematics in the flat - spacetime limit , ref.@xcite leaves open the question whether this approach can be generalized to describe deformed relativity particles phenomenology @xcite within a curved background .",
    "we would like here to implement this aspect , using as guidance some previous approaches @xcite to @xmath2-deformed particles kinematics in a totally - symmetric curved spacetime , where we will denote the parameter of spacetime curvature as @xmath8 .",
    "a clear aspect presented in @xcite is the lack of a finsler metric that would be probed through spacetime inferences with massless particles , because the massless limit of the presented metric is ill - behaved . for example , this behavior prevents us from having a metric probed by neutrinos , since , even being massive , for most practical reasons they are considered massless due to their tiny rest mass . in this paper , besides generalizing some results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we propose a different way of calculating a four - velocity - dependent ( and still partially homogeneous in the velocities ) metric , that can reproduce the main features of the standard finsler case , like the dispersion relation , the geodesics as worldlines , the presence of dsr symmetries and , furthermore , presents a well - behaved massless limit , thus allowing for a _",
    "generalized finsler metric _ for any type of particle .",
    "such generalization will allow us to propose an expression that deepens the one of jacob and piran @xcite for the mdr - induced time delay for particles with different energies , and to analyze the finsler nature of spacetime using photons / neutrinos as probes .",
    "furthermore , we will study in the last section the law of interaction between elementary particles compatible with dsr models , furnishing a description in terms of the tangent space , thus being compatible with the finsler formalism .      in this paper , in order to connect with the previous literature @xcite and express the mathematical and physical concepts in an effective and comprehensible way",
    ", we will need to rely on different notations and coordinate sets .",
    "+ the first one is the comoving relative locality coordinate set for momentum - space @xmath9 and spacetime flat slicing coordinates @xmath10 , which satisfy the relation @xmath11 in this coordinate set the hamiltonian , which formalizes the physics of particles embedded in a de sitter - like curved spacetime , with @xmath8 the parameter of curvature and @xmath2 the deformation parameter due to planck - scale effects , can be written as @xmath12 we stress that for sake of simplicity we are working in @xmath13 dimensions at first order in @xmath2 ( since the same kinematical results are preserved in a higher number of dimensions ) . in order to describe physics in an intuitive way",
    ", we will also consider the so called _ conformal time coordinatization _ expressed by coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the relation between the previous coordinate set and this latter one is @xmath16 one can verify the effectiveness of expressing physics in conformal - time coordinates by noticing that the spacetime line - element in this coordinatization can be expressed simply as @xmath17 .",
    "previous works analysing such deformed physical frameworks ( see ref.@xcite ) , express this same hamiltonian ( [ flathamilt ] ) depending on canonical variables @xmath18 , deformation parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , deformation parameter @xmath21 and cosmological constant @xmath8 .",
    "we define the energy and momentum respectively as @xmath22 and spacetime coordinates as @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in conformal coordinates we have @xmath24 it is also easy to verify that @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( as well as @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) still are conjugate variables . + the last couple of variables which will have some importance along this article is the one composed by the so called natural momenta , _ i d est _ those that have the same functional dependence of the charges of the translation generators of our spacetime : @xmath29 using those variables the expression of the hamiltonian ( [ flathamilt ] ) becomes : @xmath30 the physics of particles described by the deformed hamiltonians defined in this section was widely explored in ref.@xcite , however many aspects of the formalization of those phenomena seem to lack in such approaches to the study of deformed relativistic frameworks , such as metric formalism , killing vectors and particle interactions .",
    "we would like here to provide a first exploration on how the integration of elements borrowed by the so called deformed momentum - space framework and finsler geometry could enrich this kind of approaches to the study of deformed relativity theories , providing solid theoretical foundations to the formalism and also new suggestions on the phenomenological side .",
    "finsler geometry has been introduced in previous articles @xcite to formalize deformed relativistic frameworks defining a so called finsler norm , a homogenous function @xmath31 on tangent space . starting from the particle action in the hamiltonian formalism in flat spacetime , performing a legendre transform in @xmath32 where @xmath33 is hamiltonian ( [ flathamilt ] ) in the limit @xmath34 , and @xmath35 some lagrange multiplier . in general a semi - classical metric structure",
    "is effectively encoded in finsler geometry . on the other hand",
    "it turns out that @xmath3-poincar group ( that we are here using as foundation of a planck - scale deformed particle dynamics in a maximally symmetric spacetime ) does describe the symmetries of particles living on a de sitter curved momentum - space @xcite and flat spacetime ( see appendix for more details on momentum - space dynamics ) .",
    "the two different metric formalisms finsler metric @xmath36 and momentum - space metric @xmath37 could lead to confusion on the metric structures we refer to when we will introduce concepts such as geodesics and invariant line - element . therefore we may need here to briefly review deformed - relativistic lagrangian formalism and the role that those different metrics play in it , in the massless case for sake of simplicity .",
    "+ the minimization of ( [ genaction ] ) provide the relation between momentum and four - velocity ( here in 1 + 1d ) : @xmath38 then at first order in @xmath2 is not hard to invert this relation , finding some @xmath39 , which makes possible to re - express the casimir in terms of four - velocities : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the inverse of momentum - space metric expressed in terms od @xmath42 .",
    "it is also possible now to find an explicit solution for @xmath43 , by imposing @xmath44 . in the massive case this leads to @xmath45 in the massless case , in general , it is not possible to solve @xmath44 with respect to @xmath35 , however taking into account ( [ cxpunto ] ) and ( [ lambxpunto ] ) we can find very naturally that in the limit @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in this limit then ( [ hameq ] ) in 1 + 1d become @xmath48 and their inversion gives @xmath49 using those last results we find that the lagrangian of our theory can be expressed as @xmath50 where the lagrangian metric @xmath51 is not univocally determined , as we will better discuss later , and should be chosen according to the requests of the theory .",
    "as we can see from ( [ genlag ] ) in this kind of deformed - symmetry theories we loose the uniqueness of the metric for spacetime and momentum - space .",
    "those different metrics play a different role in the theory and one should be always careful to use the right one in the right formula .",
    "for instance for euler - lagrange derived relations , such as geodesic equations or killing equations we are referring to metric @xmath51 .",
    "the light cone structure is instead characterized in terms of momentum - space metric , since the on - shell relation is @xmath52 .",
    "intriguingly , this defines the invariant ( see refs@xcite ) element for flat spacetime as @xmath53 .",
    "+ it may be disappointing to have lost the possibility to express our theory with a unique metric , however from ( [ genlag ] ) we can still identify a couple of interesting relations : @xmath54 which highlight the duality between spacetime and momentum - space of this theory , widely discussed in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "+ in order to fully understand whether deformed relativistic frameworks and finsler geometry are physically equivalent , in @xcite were introduced symmetry transformations derived within the finsler framework with the ones generated by a deformed - poincar group .",
    "we want to show here how those generators can be obtained _ a priori _ using finsler killing equations with metric @xmath51 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will here find the boost @xmath55 representation in the limit @xmath34 and then generalize this result to the case at all orders in @xmath8 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ flathamilt ] ) at order zero in @xmath8 is of course invariant under translations since @xmath56 however if we try to find the representation of the boost imposing @xmath57 we obtain two possible solutions : @xmath58 or maybe some combination of the two .",
    "which one should we choose ?",
    "a solution to this problem can be provided by the powerful finsler formalism already explored in the formalization of deformed relativistic frameworks in ref.@xcite . in finsler geometry",
    "it is , in fact , possible to define a deformed killing equation , which for flat spacetime has the form @xmath59 we can solve those equations for a generic four - velocity - dependent metric such as @xmath60 obtaining ( see appendix for further details ) a generic representation of the boost generator of the form @xmath61 whose hamiltonian can be obtained though the contraction of momenta with the metric @xmath62 : @xmath63 the deformed poincar algebra is therefore characterized by the following poisson brackets @xmath64 in equation ( [ gencasimir12 ] ) we can recognize the limit for @xmath34 of ( [ flathamilt ] ) , under the condition @xmath65 , which introduces a freedom that we will have to constrain based on the requests of the theory . in general",
    "an approach based on curved momentum - spaces work perfectly fine with a diagonal metric , _ i d est _ @xmath66 as well as with other choices . on the other hand , in order to formalize our theory ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as a finsler geometry we will need a homogeneous - like metric , which will force us to the choice @xmath67 , as we will discuss further in this article .      now that we have obtained the representation of the boost generator in the @xmath34 limit , knowing the form of the classical de sitter generator @xmath68 it is not so difficult to find its generalization al first order in @xmath2 , _ i d est _ : @xmath69 therefore the algebra of spacetime symmetry generators @xmath70 at all orders in @xmath8 is characterized by the following poisson brackets : @xmath71 of course those relations are , by definition , coherent with the poisson brackets between generators and hamiltonian ( [ hamtrasl ] ) : @xmath72 it should be noticed that the algebra described in this section is compatible with the well - known q - de sitter algebra @xcite , at first order in @xmath2 , under the choice @xmath73 .",
    "we started with a non - trivial local structure of spacetime that could be modeled by a curved momentum - space , which is responsible for the definition of a modified dispersion relation and a deformed picture of interactions ( that will be discussed in section [ comp_rule ] ) .",
    "now , we can analyze how a spacetime can emerge from these considerations , _ i d est _ how the local structure can interfere on the geometry of the effective manifold that these high - energetic particles probe .",
    "we will follow a procedure that resembles the one presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these references",
    ", the authors perform a legendre transformation that links the action of a particle from the hamiltonian to the lagrangian formalism .",
    "since in special and general relativity one identifies the action of a massive particle with the arc - length of its trajectory , the authors generalized this assumption to the case of mdrs , defining a non - quadratic norm of the particle s four - velocity vector . which can be modeled by the well studied finsler geometry , that is defined by a four - velocity - dependent norm .",
    "the finsler norm satisfies the usual properties : @xmath74 the second one is rather important , since it expresses the homogeneity property of the norm , which in general implies @xmath75 in @xcite it was formalized that a mdr theory can be well expressed in terms of finsler geometry , identifying the finsler norm from the action integral as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is of course the finsler metric .",
    "as we will see , this metric depends on the four - velocity and mass of the particle , however , it will not have a smooth limit for massless particles .",
    "therefore , we propose an intermediate procedure that allows to define an action that serves both for the massive and massless cases , thus allowing a well - defined , unique metric that may describe a generalized finsler spacetime , that is probed by high - energetic particles .      in order to generalize",
    "the procedure just described to fully symmetric curved spacetimes , our starting point is the particle action in conformal coordinates with modified dispersion relation @xmath78 , @xmath79=\\int d\\tau [ \\dot{\\eta}\\omega+\\dot{x}\\pi-\\lambda ( { \\cal h}_\\omega - m^2)].\\ ] ] this is the simple generalization of covariant mechanics in de sitter spacetime .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath80 following the same procedures of @xcite , _ i d est _ performing the legendre transformation , substituting @xmath81 , the lagrangian is @xmath82 minimizing this lagrangian with respect to @xmath35 we get @xmath83 and thus we can identify the finsler norm related to hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as @xmath84 at this point we can make contact with geometry , identifying the semi - classical metric structure effectively encoded in the finsler formalism .",
    "the finsler metric is defined through a homogenous function on tangent space @xmath85 so @xmath86 it furnishes the de sitter metric if @xmath87 and furnishes the metric of paper @xcite for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the analysis done so far is valid for the case of massive particles , @xmath91 , since the limit @xmath46 corresponds to a singularity , implying that observables measured with such metric involving observations with particles with tiny mass , like neutrinos , would not be well defined .",
    "despite this fact , it is possible to solve the geodesic equation for massless particles by making @xmath92 in the geodesic solution just like was done in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fact , now that we have a metric for a massive particle , we can minimize the arc - length to find its world line . this way , just as it is done in @xcite , even though the massless limit does not exist for the definition of the metric , it is well - behaved for the expression of the geodesics .",
    "in fact , one could solve the geodesic equation that arises by extremizing the action , which furnishes : @xmath93=\\frac{\\dot{{\\cal f}}}{{\\cal f}}\\left[\\dot{q}^{\\alpha}+\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\dot{q}^{\\mu}}g_{\\gamma\\beta}\\right)\\dot{q}^{\\gamma}\\dot{q}^{\\beta}\\right],\\ ] ] for @xmath94 using the known expressions from the finsler geometry literature , that follow from euler theorem for homogenous functions @xmath95 we can write the geodesic equation as @xmath96    as this finsler function does not depend on the coordinate @xmath28 , we conclude that @xmath97 is a first integral to this problem , this is equivalent to equation ( [ p1 ] ) . as this formalism is invariant by reparametrization of the solution , we can choose the gauge @xmath98 .",
    "doing it and substituting in the first constrain , we can solve the equation @xmath99 integrating this equation with initial condition @xmath100 we obtain its simple solution in which incoming photons have signature @xmath101 : @xmath102 the same worldline with spatial origin in @xmath103 can as well be obtained upon integration from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , imposing the on - shell relation to the finsler norm . for a massless , on - shell particle , @xmath92 , @xmath105 , the above equation is @xmath106",
    "this is exactly the worldline found in the literature from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite . as this is the straightforward generalization of refs .",
    "@xcite , it also possesses the same kind of formal difficulties with respect to the massless metric .",
    "however , it has been argued , for example in ref @xcite , that physical observables calculated by a macroscopic observer should be performed using the classical , riemannian metric , and in this case , there would be no problem in having such ill - defined metric , because its effects ( apart from its geodesics ) would be unobservable .",
    "but we raise the possibility that the natural metric  seen \" by a particle , like the one we found with a finsler structure , could be the one considered for the calculus of observables in the new geometrical framework . which allows us to a deeper conclusion that observations performed with particles with a non - trivial dispersion relation ( no matter the origin of this deformation ) would indicate a possible non - riemannian structure of the spacetime in which they propagate .",
    "thereby , by generalizing the geometrical structure with which one describes a spacetime , the physical observables would change reciprocally .      in the previous section we performed a legendre transformation on the action of a particle with a mdr until we found a version of the action that we could identify with the arc - length of the particle s trajectory in a certain geometry .",
    "since this was a non - quadratic function , but still invariant under reparametrizations , we could identify a finsler function and derive a metric from it . for the massive case",
    ", there was no problem in the definition of the metric , but for the massless one , the metric was ill - defined .",
    "such behaviour is due to the fact that the arc - length is the nambu - goto - like version of the action and it is well - known that it can only properly describe and only makes sense its extremization for the massive case and since the metric that would be found should depend on the mass of the particle , it is natural that such kind of approach would be problematic for @xmath46 ( which was not the case in riemannian geometry .",
    "a possible solution for such impasse is the use of an unique action for both cases .",
    "therefore , we propose to read a metric from the _ polyakov - like action _ of a point particle @xcite .",
    "such formalism was initially explored in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , by performing the legendre transformation in ( [ ham_action ] ) , we ended up with the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) .",
    "as the lagrangian is an analytic function , the action can be uniquely expressed by a taylor expansion in the four - velocities @xmath107 = \\int d\\tau\\left[{\\cal l}{\\big |}_{\\dot{q } = 0 } + \\frac{\\partial \\cal l}{\\partial   \\dot{q}^{\\mu}}{\\bigg |}_{\\dot{q } = 0}\\dot{q}^{\\mu } + \\frac{1}{2!}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\cal l}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{\\mu}\\partial \\dot{q}^{\\nu}}\\bigg|_{\\dot{q } = 0}\\dot{q}^{\\mu}\\dot{q}^{\\nu } + \\frac{1}{3!}\\frac{\\partial ^3 \\cal l}{\\partial     \\dot{q}^{\\mu}\\partial\\dot{q}^{\\nu}\\partial\\dot{q}^{\\gamma}}\\bigg|_{\\dot{q } = 0}\\dot{q}^{\\mu}\\dot{q}^{\\nu}\\dot{q}^{\\gamma } + ... +",

    "since we are hypothesizing that the spacetime probed by such particles is deformed with respect to the standard riemannian one by means of a momenta - dependent metric , if an observer alice that makes inferences using these particles intends to preserve the equivalence principle , she should assign such metric structure to the spacetime manifold .",
    "for example , the geometrical locus of the photon sphere of a black hole ( bh ) is a property of the photon s worldlines , and if she wants to preserve the equivalence principle by representing them as geodesics , they would need to be compatible with the metric structure of the spacetime surrounding a bh , which would need to be of rainbow nature . in other words ,",

    "equivalently , in this model , depending on the energy of the probed particle , the induced metric will be the ordinary de sitter one induced by a standard dispersion relation or will manifest a first order correction if the particle is sufficiently energetic , induced by the corresponding mdr , which is similar to the first order correction in the mass that deforms the flat metric in the shapiro delay . in our case ,",
    "the parameter is not the mass of the schwarzschild metric , but it is the planck length @xmath2 .",

    "it was explained in @xcite , using an argument already introduced in @xcite , that if one assumes deformed spacetime symmetries , then if we assume that whenever two particles interact , different observers must agree on the existence of the interaction vertex , this latter may be deformed too .",
    "this feature is formalized in the @xmath3-poincar framework , introducing a deformed composition law for momenta @xmath173 which we can imagine as describing the decaying of a particle with momentum @xmath174 in two different particles with momenta @xmath175 and @xmath176 . at first order in the deformation parameter @xmath2",

    "then , in order to determine which coalgebric sector can be compatible with our deformed boost generator ( [ boostrepresentation ] ) , we need to find some condition which would allow us to find some relations between the composition rule parameters .",
    "those relations can be found by requiring the composition of the boosted momenta to be invariant under the action of the boost @xmath181 however , before checking whether different ( boosted ) observers agree on the existence of the particles vertex , we should pay attention to the possibility to have the so called _ backreaction _ effect @xcite , since the rapidity parameter @xmath182 can in general change in a momentum - dependent way , compatible with the coproducts of momenta and the action of lorentz transformations on momenta themselves .",
    "this effect is defined as the right action @xmath183 , that we can parametrize as @xmath184 therefore , in general we will have @xmath185 now , imposing the complete parametrization of vertex transformation ( [ rightsumrule ] ) with ( [ boostaction ] ) and ( [ rightactions ] ) , we are able to find four relations between our eight parameters @xmath186 , which ensure the existence od the vertex for any observer : @xmath187 those relations are perfectly compatible with the hamiltonian invariance under boost : @xmath188 which shows _ a posteriori _ the coherence of those composition laws with the curved momentum - space framework . the problem is if also finsler geometry can be compatible to such  deformed sum \" . in finsler geometry , in fact , the particle trajectory depends on spacetime coordinates @xmath189 and four - velocities @xmath190 , which live in a flat tangent space to the curved spacetime . on the other hand , in relative locality",
    "@xcite momenta are the fundamental observables and spacetime is defined as the cotangent bundle to the curved momentum - space .",
    "if the deformation of momenta composition law fits very well with the curved momentum - space framework , one should not give for granted for this to happen also in the finsler case .",
    "however in this section we showed that non trivial composition laws are imposed by the deformation of spacetime symmetries that arise from our theory .",
    "the impossibility to express this feature also for finsler formalism would then jeopardise our entire argument .      from our perspective",
    ", the problem of the tangent space flatness is not a real problem .",
    "in fact every local observer is flat , and curvature arises only when confronting observations between different reference frames .",
    "assuming then ( [ nontrivcomp ] ) , we are treating different particles as different reference frames in momentum - space , which can be characterized also as a non - trivial composition for four - velocities , formalizing the relations between the different locally - flat reference frames .",
    "this feature can be obtained taking into account a two - parameters family of coproducts and momenta compositions that we can obtain from ( [ rappparamgener ] ) : @xmath191 and @xmath192 then , using the expression of four - velocities with respect to momenta ( [ uxoux1 ] ) with ( [ composition0 ] ) and ( [ composition1 ] ) , in the massless case , we can easily obtain the composition laws for @xmath42 : @xmath193 those laws satisfy the relation @xmath194 where the backreaction has the exact same form of the one described in the previous section .",
    "a nice property that we can find _ a posteriori _ in the massless case is @xmath195 in which @xmath196 is the velocity that we already found in our massless worldlines ( [ solmassless ] ) .",
    "this structure of relations between different tangent spaces allows us to identify the phase - space invariant element as : @xmath197    the doubt we had at the beginning of this section was whether it is possible to express departures from poincar symmetries , often formalized in the literature as a deformed hamiltonian framework ( @xmath2-deformed phase space ) , within the context of the lagrange - finsler geometry ( tangent space ) .",
    "as commented in @xcite finsler geometry could be used to describe both breakdown and deformation of spacetime symmetries .",
    "however we have showed here that this symmetry deformation implies the necessity to characterize velocities as living in a tangent space with non - trivial translation laws .",
    "those laws moreover result to be compatible with the phase - space deformation of the theory ( [ flathamilt ] ) .",
    "the question of what may be the nature of the spacetime emerging from a semi - classical limit of a quantum description of the gravitational degrees of freedom is still open .",
    "possibly , we may have a dimensional reduction coming from cdt , hoava - lifshitz gravity and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) , non - local metrics @xcite , rainbow - like metrics coming from a quantization of geometrical and matter - like degrees of freedom @xcite and , as we have shown , a possible finsler nature coming from a mdr",
    ". in all these cases there exists a common point : the non - riemannian nature of spacetime . which is not a complete surprise , after all there is no _ a priori _",
    "request for nature of spacetime to be limited to riemannian geometry at all scales , despite the abundance of well - defined geometrical structures ( not to mention those that are still to be discovered ) .    in this paper , we analyzed the possibility of having a deformed dispersion relation within a curved background , investigating what kind of manifold could be the most natural to `` host '' them .",
    "we generalized the results presented in @xcite and we proposed a solution for the massless limit problem , _ i d est _ we found a candidate partially - homogeneous metric using , which are possible to formalize , the most important properties that a proper geometrical model for the description of elementary particles should provide , such as the geodesic equation and the dispersion relation .",
    "the presence of such unified finsler structure that an observer would assign to spacetime , when performing measurements observing high - energetic particles , allowed us to formalize the usual phenomenology of time delays of photons from grbs due to the energy - dependent speed of light presented in @xcite , plus a correction of the order of the planck length originated from the non - riemannian structure of spacetime , with these both contributions having the same geometrical origin .",
    "we also estimated the correction that such a model could bring to the cosmological redshift effect . in this context",
    ", it would be extremely interesting to test such effect using cosmological data , however unfortunately the best observations on some kind of energy dependence for the cosmological redshift yet published @xcite do not have the sensitivity to discriminate the kind of effect we found here .",
    "the authors found no energy dependence with a precision of @xmath198 , whereas in the visible range of electromagnetic radiation ( @xmath199 ) the effect we take into account would be of the order of @xmath200 on the redshift magnitude . in any case",
    ", we need phenomenological analysis with more energetic particles .",
    "the last open issue we explored is the deformation of velocities composition law in the finsler tangent space that symmetrical @xmath2-deformed theories require ( as already pointed out in @xcite ) , in order to allow to different observers to agree on the occurrence ( or not ) of some interaction event .",

    "<S> in recent years , planck - scale modifications to particles dispersion relation have been deeply studied for the possibility to formulate some phenomenology of planckian effects in astrophysical and cosmological frameworks . </S>",
