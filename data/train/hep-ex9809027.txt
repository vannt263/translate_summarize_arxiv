    "the zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite experiments , studying deep - inelastic positron proton scattering ( dis ) at hera , recently reported an excess of events in the region of high bjorken-@xmath6 and large negative photon virtualities ( @xmath7 )  .",
    "this excess may result from the production of a r - parity violating squark @xmath0 or of a leptoquark @xmath1 via the fusion of a positron and a quark ( see fig .",
    "[ f : lqdiag ] ) , @xmath8    for the purpose of this note , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are interchangeable .",
    "the symbol @xmath1 will be used to denote either one of them .",
    "the data indicate for the mass of the @xmath1 a value around @xmath9 200230  gev which corresponds to a proton momentum fraction @xmath6 carried by the fusing quark of @xmath10 0.450.60 , where @xmath11 is the square of the total @xmath12 c.m .",
    "energy and @xmath13 are the positron and proton beam energies .",
    "the possible existence of @xmath0 or @xmath1 in this mass range prompted us to study the @xmath2 production rate as a function of the hera beam energies .",
    "the lowest order cross section for producing a scalar r - parity violating squark @xmath0 or leptoquark @xmath1 in @xmath12 collisions can be written as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the standard dis variables and @xmath17 is the momentum density of the quark of type @xmath18 in the proton fusing with an electron or positron , generically denoted by @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is a coupling constant which depends on the type of quark and lepton that form the @xmath2 state .",
    "the large value of @xmath6 plus the small production cross section combined with the absence of a signal in the electron - proton data favors the assumption that the fusing quark is an up or down quark ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since the density of anti - sea quarks is small at large @xmath6 we expect that the @xmath1 production cross section is proportional to the momentum densities of the quarks , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , which are steeply falling with @xmath6 at high @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason , a large increase of the production cross section can be obtained by a moderate increase of the hera beam energies .",
    "this note presents the expected increase of the @xmath2 production cross section and the @xmath2 search range for various combinations of positron and proton beam energies .",
    "also given are the number of background events predicted by the standard model ( sm ) for neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) @xmath5 scattering .",
    "the data reported in  @xcite were taken at the ( nominal ) beam energies of @xmath24  gev , @xmath25  gev .",
    "the range explored in this study is @xmath3 27.535  gev and @xmath4 8201100  gev .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath26  gev and @xmath27  gev should be considered as extreme upper limits for hera .",
    "the scalar @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) production cross sections were calculated from eq .",
    "( [ e : lqxsec ] ) for the processes @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the quark momentum densities were taken from the parton distribution set mrsa  @xcite . in order to fix the production rate of @xmath1 events",
    "the @xmath1 cross section was integrated over @xmath31 and normalized such that the number of @xmath1 candidates accepted in @xmath32 nc scattering as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is approximately reproduced .",
    "taking @xmath33 gev and assuming 10 @xmath1 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath34  pb@xmath35 at the nominal beam energies @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) = 27.5 ( 820 )  gev yields for the coupling constant @xmath20 the values 0.045 , 0.021 , 0.7 for the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 states , respectively . for simplicity , we assume that the acceptance for @xmath1 candidates does not depend on whether a nc or a cc event sample is selected .",
    "the background from the standard nc processes , @xmath41 , was estimated by calculating the differential cross sections @xmath42 taking into account the contributions from @xmath43 interference and @xmath44 exchange  @xcite . likewise the cross sections @xmath45 were calculated for the cc processes @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in eqs .",
    "( [ ncxsec ] ) and  ( [ ccxsec ] ) @xmath48 is the fine structure constant , @xmath49 the fermi constant , @xmath50 the mass of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the structure functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 were calculated in leading order with the parton distributions of the proton taken from mrsa .",
    "the contribution from @xmath55 in this region of high @xmath6 is expected to be small and was neglected .",
    "the cross sections were integrated over @xmath31 and over the band @xmath56 which corresponds roughly to @xmath57 2 standard deviations for the @xmath1 mass measurement of  @xcite .",
    "the number of background events was obtained by normalizing the @xmath32 nc cross section to a yield of 0.675 accepted events in the bin @xmath58 , @xmath31 and @xmath59  pb@xmath35  @xcite . in this way the acceptance quoted in  @xcite for @xmath32 nc scattering is approximately taken into account .",
    "the same acceptance was assumed for @xmath60 nc and @xmath5 cc scattering .",
    "tables  [ t : tab1 ] and  [ t : tab2 ] give the estimated event yields ( @xmath62 ) for @xmath63 , @xmath64 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath34  pb@xmath35 for various combinations of @xmath3 27.535  gev , @xmath4 8201100  gev and @xmath61 = 200230  gev . also given are the expected number of @xmath32 and @xmath60 nc and cc background events ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath32 scattering the cc background is about a factor of five lower than the nc background whereas in @xmath60 scattering the cc and nc contributions are roughly equal in size .",
    "the total background in @xmath32 scattering is about a factor of four lower than in @xmath60 .",
    "tables  [ t : tab3 ] and  [ t : tab4 ] present the gain in @xmath1 production , defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69 ( 820 )  gev denote the nominal beam energies . also listed",

    "[ f : gaind ] and  [ f : gainu ] we show the gain in @xmath1 events with respect to production at nominal beam energies for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the gain is larger for larger leptoquark masses mainly because the shift towards smaller @xmath73 is larger when @xmath61 increases , see tables  [ t : tab1 ] and  [ t : tab2 ] . comparing figs .",
    "[ f : gaind ] and  [ f : gainu ] it is seen that a larger gain is obtained for the @xmath38 as compared to the @xmath39 case .",
    "this is so because the @xmath74 distribution is considerably steeper at high @xmath6 than the @xmath75 distribution as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : dus3e4]a . for @xmath76 production",
    "the gain is particularly large ( see fig .  [",
    "f : gains ] ) because the strange quark distribution is a very steep function of @xmath6 at large @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : dus3e4]b , where the distribution from mrsa is compared with those from cteq3 m  @xcite and grv  @xcite : the gain in @xmath1 production from @xmath77 quarks is about a factor of 1.5 lower if cteq3 m instead of mrsa parton distributions are used .",

    "the reduced nc and cc cross sections at fixed @xmath7 above the masses squared of w , z increase with @xmath77 while for @xmath83 scattering they decrease .",

    ", we assumed @xmath88 . assuming that a @xmath2 signal can be established with 10 events , a minimum cross section of 50 fb is required for an integrated luminosity of 200 pb@xmath35 . for the nominal beam energies ( @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 gev ) this condition limits the search range to masses of 225 - 235 gev . by raising the beam energies to ( 32.5 gev , 1000 gev )",
    "the search range is extended by about 40 gev to 270 - 280 gev . if the beam energies are raised even higher to ( 35 gev , 1100 gev ) the search range increases to @xmath89 gev .",
