    "physical properties of galaxies depend on the formation conditions and evolution .",
    "in addition to intrinsic evolution , galaxies are exposed to environmental influence ( among others dressler 1980 , lewis et al .",
    "2002 , gomez et al .",
    "2003 , einasto et al .",
    "2003 , blanton et al .",
    "2005 , weinmann et al .",
    "2006 , martinez et al .",
    "2006 , park et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "the density of galaxies ( number of galaxies per volume unit ) or luminosity density as well as the number of galaxies in group / cluster or distance to the nearest galaxy is often implied as regarding the environment .",
    "the influence of an environment can be found till 1 mpc and even farther ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 , blanton et al .",
    "2005 , park et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , where small galaxy groups are observed .",
    "the study of `` enviromental effects '' in such poor galaxy groups is helpful for understanding the galaxy evolution on intermediate scales between isolated galaxies and rich groups / clusters .",
    "the isolated galaxies that have not sufficiently undergone the influence of environment allow us to consider them as the `` autonomous laboratories '' for studying evolutionary processes in the galaxies .",
    "individual properties of isolated galaxies ( mass , luminosity , morphology , colour - index etc . ) can be served as the standard when studying galaxies in the different environment ( see , for example , karachentseva 1973 ( kig ) , prada et al .",
    "2003 , reda et al .",
    "2004 , stocke et al .",
    "2004 , verley et al .",
    "for studing of galaxies properties in different environment it is also important to define the galaxy s isolation degree which is suitable to describe by some parameter .",
    "for example , karachentsev and kasparova ( 2005 ) used the tidal index for each galaxy to study global properties of nearest galaxies in different environments .",
    "verley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) quantified the isolation degree of kig galaxies by two parameters : local number density and tidal strength .",
    "it is known that with the increase of galaxy systems richness from individual galaxies to clusters , their mass increases more quickly than luminosity ( karachentsev et al .",
    "1966 , girardi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the dark matter in small groups seems to be distributed in the whole volume of system in the case of compact groups and to be concentrated in the halo of individual galaxies in the case of loose groups ( mulchaey et al .",
    "2003 , melnyk & vavilova 2006 , da rocha et al .",
    "2008 ) . at the same time",
    "the amount of dark matter in galaxy groups is not enough for standard cosmological model ( makarov & karachentsev 2007 ) .    as a rule , for identifying groups by different selection methods , the principle of overdensity in comparison with background",
    "the richer the group population , the overdensity is more strong and therefore more likely that such a group is physically bound .",
    "poor groups identification depends strongly on the limiting parameters of the method .",
    "these systems can be easily confused with the random physically not bound systems . for this reason ,",
    "many authors prefer to study rich groups / clusters only .",
    "that is why the elaboration of the reliable methods for identifying small groups will allows us to pay more attention these structures .",
    "karachentsev ( 1972 , 1987 ) and karachentseva et al . ( 1979 , 2000 ) used 2d method for pairs and triplets selection taking into account the isolation degree in comparison with the foreground and the background .",
    "the environment of each pair and triplet was inspected using possi , possii and eso / serc plates .",
    "this method selects effectively the isolated systems , which are compact in a projection with characteristic distance between galaxies @xmath1 kpc .",
    "with appearance of the large databases and surveys ( leda , ned , sdss , cfa2 , ssrs2 , deep2 , 2df ) and information about the radial velocities of galaxies the application of three - dimensional methods of selection became generally accepted .",
    "3d methods of group s identification use as a rule two limited parameters : projected distance between galaxies @xmath2 and radial velocity difference @xmath3 . for example , barton et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) , geller et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , woods et al .",
    "( 2006 ) selected close pairs of galaxies from cfa2 catalogue with @xmath4 50 kpc and @xmath51000 km  s@xmath6 , isolation criterion was ignored .",
    "patton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) investigated galaxy pairs from ssrs2 .",
    "they considered all pairs with @xmath7100 kpc and did nt find pairs with the signs of interaction with @xmath8 600  km  s@xmath6 , but most of pairs with interaction signs had @xmath9 kpc and @xmath10 500 km  s@xmath6 ( see also patton et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 , xu et al .",
    "2004 , de propris et al .",
    "nikolic et al .",
    "( 2004 ) obtained similar results for sdss pairs .",
    "the authors found that a star - formation rate is significantly enhanced for the projected separations less then 30 kpc .",
    "lambas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and alonso et al .",
    "( 2004 ) considered galaxy pairs with @xmath4 1 mpc and @xmath10 1000 km  s@xmath6 from 2df survey .",
    "they analyzed the star formation activity in the pairs as a function of both relative projected distance and relative radial velocity and found that the star formation activity in galaxy pairs is significantly enhanced over that in isolated galaxies at similar redshifts for @xmath4 25 kpc and @xmath10 100 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "soares ( 2007 ) showed that more than half of the simulated pairs with projected distance @xmath11 kpc have 3d separations greater than 50 kpc .",
    "therefore for the selection of real physical pair it is important to take into account the signs of interaction , but that is not always possible .",
    "triplets of galaxies are less studied than pairs .",
    "mainly triplets have been selected from the catalogues of groups of different population ( trofimov & chernin , 1995 ) .",
    "for example , vavilova et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , karachentseva et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , melnyk ( 2006 ) , melnyk & vavilova ( 2006 ) compared the kinematic , dynamical , configurational and morphological properties of triplets from the samples formed by different methods .",
    "they showed that physical properties of galaxy groups strongly depend on selection criteria .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to provide the uniform selection of the single galaxies , pairs and triplets from sloan digital sky survey for later analysis of their properties : mass - to - luminosity ratio , colour indices , morphology and others .",
    "such investigation can be helpful for study the environmental influence and dark matter content on small scales ( galaxy  pair  triplet ) . to meet this goal we made not only selection of the most isolated galaxies and systems , but also single galaxies , pairs and triplets with different isolation degrees .",
    "most authors mentioned above used simple selection alghorithms for pair identification : they consider all pairs with the fixed limitation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which describe properties of galaxy pair only as a separate system , without information about their neighbours .",
    "contrary to this we propose another approach .",
    "we use the second - order voronoi tessellation for galaxy pairs identification where the fundamental elements are pairs and the third - order voronoi tessellation for galaxy triplets identification where the fundamental elements are triplets .",
    "the geometric properties of the high - order tessellations give information about relative location of neighbouring galaxies .",
    "this allows us to analyse the correlations of group properties with environment .",
    "the high - order ( second or third -order ) voronoi tessellation method has not been applied earlier for groups detection , unlike the first - order voronoi tessellation .",
    "using the galaxies from sdss dr5 survey with known redshifts allows us to realize the 3d approach .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the method and parameters .",
    "the sample of galaxies is described in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with other works .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "voronoi diagram was introduced by g. voronoi in 1908 .",
    "the most popular is the first - order voronoi diagram ( so called voronoi tessellation ) , fig .",
    "it is a geometric method of space partition on regions .",
    "each region consists of one nucleus and all the points of space that are closer to a given nucleus than to other nuclei ( matsuda & shima 1984 , lindenbergh 2002 ) .",
    "kiang ( 1966 ) found analytic function of voronoi cell volume distribution for random points in 2d and 3d space .",
    "a voronoi tessellation is used widely in astrophysics , especially for modelling the galaxy and voids large - scale structure distribution ( icke & van de weygaert 1987 , van de weygaert & icke 1989 , van de weygaert 1994 , zaninetti 2006 , van de weygaert & schaap 2007 ) , for studying periodicities in deep pencil - beam sky surveys ( van de weygaert 1991 , williams et al .",

    "2000 ) , extragalactic radiosources distribution ( benn & wall 1995 ) , for modeling of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( coles & barrow 1990 , subbarao et al . 1994 ) etc .",
    "ebeling & wiedenmann ( 1993 ) were the first who applied voronoi tessellation for finding groups and clusters of galaxies in 2d case .",
    "later such approach was used by ramella et al .",

    "3d voronoi tessellation for galaxy groups identification was realized by marinoni et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and cooper et al .",
    "the application of 3d voronoi tessellation to deep2 survey was introduced by gerke et al .",
    "melnyk et al .",
    "( 2006 ) applied the first - order 3d voronoi tessellation for the identification of galaxy groups in the local supercluster .",
    "the authors demonstrated that the first - order tessellation is more useful for searching the rich clusters of galaxies than the small groups . in the first - order voronoi",
    "tesselation the key parameter is the volume of galaxy s voronoi cell @xmath12 .",
    "this parameter characterizes a galaxy environmental density .",
    "the condition of cluster / group membership of certain galaxy is the relatively small value of @xmath12 .",
    "this condition is true when the galaxy is surrounded by close neighbouring galaxies .",
    "that is why the first order voronoi tessellation is not corrected for the identifing small isolated galaxy systems ( see melnyk et al .",
    "2006 for details ) . in this paper",
    "we propose the high - order 3d voronoi tessellation method for pairs and triplets identification .",
    "let us consider this method below .",
    "contrary to the first - order tessellation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) the second - order tessellation for set @xmath13 distribution of nuclei is the partition of the space which associates a region @xmath14 with each pairs of nuclei 1 and 2 from @xmath13 in such a way that all points in @xmath14 are closer to 1 and 2 than other nuclei from @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "region @xmath14 is a _ common cell _ for nuclei 1 and 2 .",
    "and they do not lie in this cell .",
    "] in such a way the second - order voronoi tessellation is available for the identification of single galaxies and pairs .",
    "the third - order voronoi tessellation is appropriate for the triplets identification .",
    "it is the partition of the space which associates a region @xmath15 with each triplet of nuclei 1 , 2 , 3 in such a way that all points in @xmath15 are closer to nuclei 1 , 2 , 3 than other nuclei from @xmath13 ( lindenbergh 2002 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig1]c .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath16 maximal distance",
    "@xmath2 correlates with @xmath17 : @xmath18 , the correlation coefficient is 0.87 for triplets , and @xmath19 for pairs .",
    "an observable agreement with previous results is additional evidence of the correctness of applying the high - order voronoi tessellation method for identification of pairs and triplets .",
    "for the first time we introduced and applied the high - order 3d voronoi tessellation method for identification of isolated galaxies , pairs and triplets .",
    "we used volume - limited sample of 6786 galaxies from northern part of the sdss dr5 spectroscopic survey ( 3000 km  s@xmath6 @xmath20 9500 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we select single galaxies and pairs by the second - order voronoi tessellation , as well as triplets by the third - order voronoi tessellation method . as a result we formed 2196 geometric pairs , 1182 triplets and 2394 single galaxies .",
    "then we introduced parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 to characterize the isolation degree of pairs , triplets and single galaxies , respectively .",
    "we did not do a clear division between physical gravitationally bound systems and non - physical ones , following supposition , that than system is more isolated , the more probability that it is physical .",
    "we named the quaters of our single galaxies , pairs and triplets with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , respectively , as `` isolated '' ( i.e. with highest isolation degree ) .",
    "the values of quartiles see in table  [ tab1d ] .",
    "so , we consider the properties of single galaxies , pairs and triplets in dependence of their isolation degree ( in different environment ) .    our main conclusions .    compact pairs ( @xmath27 150 kpc ) and triplets ( @xmath27 200 kpc )",
    "are more isolated in average than systems in geometric samples , thus they are characterized by different isolation degree . the wider pair ( triplet ) , the smaller isolation degree is observed .",
    "small values of parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the evidence of loose environment of these systems ( they have not a `` free space '' to be the isolated groups ) .",
    "thus , we consider wide geometric pairs and triplets as accidental ones in the common field .",
    "we compared the luminosities of single galaxies and galaxies in geometric pairs and triplets .",
    "it was shown that galaxies in isolated pairs and triplets are two times more luminous than isolated galaxies .",
    "on one hand it is the evidence of our geometric method accuracy . on the other hand",
    ", we can conclude that in such small groups as pairs and triplets the luminosity - density relation is observed .",
    "we considered dark matter content in our groups .",
    "the median values of @xmath30 for our samples limited by different criteria are 12 @xmath0 for isolated pairs , 44 @xmath0 for isolated triplets , 7 ( 8) @xmath0 for most compact pairs ( triplets ) with @xmath4 50 ( 100 ) kpc .",
    "note , that for most compact ( close or interacting ) systems is not very large difference in dark matter content for pairs and triplets , but for isolated triplets the @xmath30 is larger in 3 times than for pairs .",
    "these results are in agreement with works of other authors .",
    "we also found that the pair / triplet is less isolated system ( in denser environment ) , when @xmath30 greater .",
    "this relation testifies that galaxy systems in denser environment have greater rms velocity ( because of @xmath31 at fixed distance between galaxies ) .",
    "the @xmath32- @xmath30 dependences are observed only for compact systems ( up to 150 - 200 kpc for pairs and up to 250 - 300 kpc for triplets ) .",
    "we concluded that 3d voronoi high - order tessellation method is the effective tool for small groups identification and studying their properties in dependence on environment . in the next paper",
    "we will present results on morphological content and colour indices of galaxies in pairs and triplets in comparison with isolated galaxies and their environment .",
