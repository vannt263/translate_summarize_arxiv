    "recent wide area photometric and spectroscopic surveys of large numbers of stars in local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) have resulted in major progress in our knowledge of these objects and a more complete picture of their characteristics .",
    "they appear to be the most dark matter ( dm ) dominated objects known to date , with mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios larger than 100 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; their kinematic status is generally believed to be undisturbed by interactions with the milky way ( mw ) , with the exception of carina ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , botes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and perhaps ursa minor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases",
    "a number of spatial and kinematic substructures have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* , hereafter b07 ) , which are perhaps the remnants of accreted subunits ( stellar clusters or smaller galaxies ) .",
    "furthermore , the combination of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and kinematic information have unveiled the presence of multiple stellar components in the sculptor ( scl ) and fornax dsphs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t04 ) , where the metal rich ( mr ) stars have a more centrally concentrated , less extended spatial distribution , and show colder kinematics than the metal poor ( mp ) stars .    the presence of multiple stellar populations may require a modification in the way these systems are dynamically modeled to derive their mass content .",
    "traditionally , their mass distribution has been derived from the jeans analysis of the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "velocity dispersion obtained considering all stars as a single component embedded in an extended dm halo .",
    "this analysis is subject to the well known degeneracy between the mass distribution and the orbital motions of the individual stars in the system ( mass - anisotropy degeneracy ) , which prevents a distinction amongst different dm profiles .    in this letter",
    "we show that it is possible to partially break this degeneracy by modeling scl as a two-(stellar)component system embedded in a dm halo .",
    "as part of the modeling of scl , we also analyzed its dynamical status , and for the first time , we determine the presence of ( statistically significant ) intrinsic rotation in the stellar component of a dsph .",
    "we acquired photometric data from the eso/2.2 m wide field imager ( wfi ) at la silla , and spectroscopic follow - up data in the ca  ii triplet ( cat ) region from flames at the vlt .",
    "our spectroscopic targets were chosen from the wfi imaging to have the colors and magnitudes consistent with red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "we acquired data for 15 different fields in scl ( 7 fields in addition to those presented in t04 ) .",
    "for details of the data reduction and analysis see @xcite . from the imaging we obtained the surface density profile of the different stellar populations in scl and from the spectroscopy we measured line - of - sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "velocities , and cat metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) calibrated using the relation derived in @xcite .    using an iterative procedure we measure a systemic velocity @xmath10 km  s@xmath2and a dispersion @xmath11 km  s@xmath2for scl . a simple kinematic membership selection ( stars with heliocentric l.o.s .",
    "velocity within 3@xmath12 from @xmath13 ) produces 470 probable scl members , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation]a .",
    "we use this sample when investigating the kinematic status of scl ( sect .",
    "[ sec : kinematicstatus ] ) , and adopt a more accurate membership criterion when deriving the l.o.s.dispersion profile ( sect .  [ sec : dispersion ] ) .",
    "we first focus on the kinematic status of scl in terms of tidal disruption and intrinsic rotation , as both these factors can inflate the observed l.o.s .  velocity dispersion profile .",
    "no signs of tidal disruption such as tidal tails and s - shaped contours are found in our photometric data - set ( battaglia et al .",
    ", in prep ) , although they are not necessarily expected as shown in n - body simulations by @xcite .",
    "the presence of a velocity gradient along the direction of the galaxy s orbital motion ( indicated by the proper motion direction ) is another possible sign of tidal disruption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will call such a velocity gradient `` apparent rotation '' to distinguish it from intrinsic rotation . fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation]b shows the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) velocities of the probable members of scl found within @xmath10.15 deg from its projected major axis ( position angle pa@xmath14 ) . at a projected radius @xmath15  deg the median velocity is @xmath16 km  s@xmath2larger than the systemic and at @xmath17  deg it is @xmath18 km  s@xmath2lower . the best - fitting straight - line gives a velocity gradient of @xmath19 km  s@xmath2deg@xmath2 . for comparison ,",
    "no velocity gradients are found along the minor axis ( pa@xmath20 ) and other two explored axes at intermediate pa ( 45@xmath21 , 135@xmath21 ) .",
    "other techniques such as bisection @xcite support these results .",
    "this signal is unlikely to be significantly affected by the foreground since at a projected distance from scl s center of 0.5 - 0.7 deg the expected fraction of mw contaminants in the 3@xmath12 membership range is only @xmath010% .    if the measured velocity gradient is caused by tidal disruption , then it should arise along the direction of scl s proper motion , which appears not to be the case according to the measurements by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the errors on the proper motions are large , it is encouraging that both works agree on the amplitude along the north - south direction , indicating that it is unlikely that more accurate measurements will lead to an orbit aligned with the major axis of scl . in fig .",
    "1a we also show the resulting orbits obtained by integrating these proper motions and the l.o.s .",
    "velocity of scl in a galactic potential .",
    "if the tidal debris is aligned with the orbit , then approaching velocities would be detected on the east side of the galaxy , and receding on the west side , opposite to what is observed .",
    "furthermore , the simulations by @xcite also show that velocity gradients due to tidal disruption usually appear at larger projected radii , equal to the king limiting radius ( @xmath0 1.3 deg for scl , see irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) with amplitudes of @xmath222 km  s@xmath2 , much smaller than measured here . from these arguments we conclude that it is more likely that the detected velocity gradient is due to intrinsic rotation than to tidal disruption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a different interpretation based mostly on photometric data )",
    ". this would therefore be the first time that statistically significant rotation has been found in the stellar component of a dsph .    in the following analysis we use rotation - subtracted gsr velocities .",
    "the rotational velocity subtracted to each star is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 km  s@xmath2deg@xmath2 and @xmath25 is the projected abscissa on the sky .",
    "scl hosts two stellar populations with distinct spatial , metallicity and kinematic distributions ( t04 and references therein ) .",
    "our spectroscopic sample of rgb stars shows that mr ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) stars are less extended spatially and have colder kinematics than mp ( [ fe / h]@xmath27 ) stars[fe / h]@xmath28 to limit kinematic contamination between the two populations . ] .",
    "mr and mp rgb stars appear to trace , respectively , the red horizontal and blue horizontal branch populations ( rhb and bhb , respectively ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : density ] . the number surface density profile of rgb stars from our photometry is well approximated by a two - component fit , where each component is given by the rescaled best - fitting profile derived from our photometry for the rhb and bhb stars .      in the following",
    "we derive the observed velocity dispersion profiles of mr and mp rgb stars and use them jointly to constrain the scl mass content . however , we first need to take into account the presence of mw interlopers which might contaminate our sample and affect the dynamical modeling .",
    "the probability of a mw interloper within the 3@xmath12 kinematic sample increases with the projected distance from the scl center as a consequence of the decreasing ratio of the stellar density of scl versus the mw .",
    "as we can not directly weed out these interlopers using our photometry or spectra we take them into account in a statistical way using a maximum likelihood method .",

    "@xmath39 is the velocity distribution of mw stars , which we assume does not change across the face of scl , and is derived from the besanon model @xcite selecting stars along the l.o.s .  and with magnitudes and colors similar to the scl rgb stars .",
    "we assume that the scl velocity distribution is a gaussian whose peak velocity @xmath40 and dispersion @xmath12 ( the quantities we want to derive ) are allowed to vary with projected radius .",
    "we derive the normalization factors , @xmath41 and @xmath42 directly from the observed rgb surface density profile and relative foreground density . to estimate the fraction of mw interlopers in the mr and mp sub - samples",
    "we simply count how many stars with velocities @xmath43 ( i.e. the non - membership region more populated by foreground stars ) are classified as mr and as mp on the basis of their cat derived [ fe / h ] value .",
    "the likelihood of observing a set of velocities @xmath30 with @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "we consider two dm mass models : a pseudo - isothermal sphere , typically cored , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an nfw profile , cusped @xcite . since the contribution of the stars to the total mass of the system is negligible for reasonable stellar m / l ratios , we do not consider it further .",
    "as @xmath54 is unknown we explore two hypotheses : a velocity anisotropy constant with radius , and an osipkov - merritt ( om ) velocity anisotropy @xcite . for the latter profile ,",
    "the velocity anisotropy is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the anisotropy radius .",
    "we explore a range of core radii @xmath59 for the pseudo - isothermal sphere ( @xmath60 kpc ) and a range of concentrations @xmath61 for the nfw profile ( @xmath62 ) . by fixing these",
    ", each mass model has two free parameters left : the anisotropy and the dm halo mass ( enclosed within the last measured point for the isothermal sphere , at 1.3 deg @xmath63 1.8 kpc assuming a distance to scl of 79 kpc , see mateo 1998 ; the virial mass for the nfw model ) .",
    "we compute a @xmath64 for the mr and mp components separately ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ) by comparing the various models to the data .",
    "the best - fitting model is obtained by minimizing the sum @xmath67 .",
    "we quote as errors in the individual parameters the projections of the @xmath68 region ( corresponding to the region of 68.3% _ joint _",
    "probability for a three free parameters @xmath64 distribution ) .    the models with constant velocity anisotropy yield poor fits for both a cored and a cusped profile .",
    "the best - fitting models in the hypothesis of an om velocity anisotropy are shown in figure  [ fig : sigmalos]a , b and provide very good fits for both the mr and mp components , simultaneously .",
    "we find that a pseudo - isothermal sphere with @xmath40.5 kpc , @xmath69 m@xmath6 , @xmath70 kpc and @xmath71 kpc gives an excellent description of the data ( @xmath72 , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "this gives an m / l ratio for scl within 1.8 kpc of 158@xmath133 ( m / l)@xmath7 , an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates @xcite .",
    "also an nfw model is statistically consistent with the data ( @xmath8 , virial mass @xmath75 m@xmath6 , @xmath76 kpc and @xmath77 kpc , @xmath78 , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) , but tends to over - predict the central values of the mr velocity dispersion , and this tendency is accentuated for larger concentrations .",
    "this model gives a mass within the last measured point of @xmath81 m@xmath6 , which is consistent with the mass predicted by the best - fitting isothermal sphere model .",
    "[ fig : sigmalos]c clearly shows the mass - anisotropy degeneracy present when modeling scl as a single stellar component system : both a cored profile with om velocity anisotropy and an nfw model with constant velocity anisotropy give a very good fit to the observed l.o.s .  velocity dispersion profile ,",
    "and they are indistinguishable .",
    "we have explored the kinematic status and mass content of the scl dsph using accurate line - of - sight velocities and cat [ fe / h ] measurements from vlt / flames spectra of 470 scl probable members .",
    "the large spatial coverage and statistics of this data - set , combined with the accurate velocity measurements , allowed us for the first time to detect in the stellar component of a dsph a statistically significant velocity gradient likely due to intrinsic rotation .",
    "this gradient is @xmath19 km  s@xmath2deg@xmath2 along the scl projected major axis .",
    "the presence of rotation in dsphs could support scenarios in which the progenitors of these objects were rotationally supported , disky systems , tidally stirred by the interaction with the mw ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the efficiency of the transformation from this kind of systems into dsphs , which are spheroidal in shape and have a pressure supported kinematics , is dependent on the eccentricity of the orbit and pericentric distance with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "it is likely that objects which have not been efficiently stirred could retain some of their initial kinematic characteristics , such as for example rotation .    under the hypothesis that scl is not tidally disrupted",
    "we have determined its mass using the jeans equations , which assume dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the combined fit of mr and mp stars allows us to to partly relieve the mass - anisotropy degeneracy present in modeling scl as a single stellar population and to exclude the models with constant velocity anisotropy ( battaglia et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
