    "since the pioneering works that founded loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , this field of research has undergone an impressive progress .",
    "its application to the quantization of homogeneous cosmologies reveals that , while the behavior in semiclassical regions agrees with general relativity , the loop quantization effects change drastically the dynamics around the planck regime , making gravity repulsive .",
    "this behavior leads to the resolution of classical strong singularities , such as the big bang , since they get replaced by a quantum bounce @xcite where energy densities reach a finite maximum critical value @xcite . for details about the quantization of homogeneous models in lqc",
    ", we refer to the reviews and references therein .    despite the success in the quantization of homogeneous models",
    ", a realistic quantum cosmology applicable to our universe asks for the introduction of inhomogeneities .",
    "inhomogeneous models are technically much more complicated than homogeneous ones because they possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom , or in other words , they are described by field theories . in order to face their quantization within the framework of lqc , a hybrid canonical approach has been proposed .",
    "it consists in quantizing the ( global ) zero - modes of the geometry following the lqc methods , while applying more conventional representation methods for the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "this allows one to consistently deal with the field complexity of the system .",
    "more concretely , the zero - modes of the possibly existing matter fields are quantized  la schrdinger , while the inhomogeneities of the geometry and of the matter fields ( if present ) are quantized  la fock .",
    "the hybrid approach extends to inhomogeneous situations the procedure that was already adopted in homogeneous lqc with a ( homogeneous as well ) massless scalar field , for which only the geometry is quantized  la loop , while the scalar field is treated in a conventional schrdinger representation @xcite . in this homogeneous case ,",
    "the discrete quantum nature that the geometry acquires owing to the loop quantization is enough to solve the singularity problem .",
    "the hybrid quantization of inhomogeneous models rests on a similar assumption , namely , that the zero - modes of the geometry already encode the main quantum geometry features , and then it is meaningful to apply a quantum - gravity inspired representation to them , while the rest of degrees of freedom can be treated in a conventional way .",
    "the hybrid approach ought to provide a suitable framework for a regime in between standard quantum field theory on curved spacetimes and the full loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) regime .",
    "the zero - mode of the hamiltonian constraint couples the homogeneous and inhomogeneous sectors , and because of the loop quantization of the homogeneous gravitational sector , it retains the main quantum geometry effects .",
    "one then expects that physical states display singularity resolution , in the same way as it happens in the homogeneous case .",
    "the first model that was quantized following this hybrid lqc approach was the gowdy model in vacuo , with three - torus ( @xmath0 ) topology , and linear polarization @xcite .",
    "gowdy models are midisuperspaces with compact spatial sections and two axial killing fields @xcite .",
    "the model with the three - torus topology for the spatial sections and linearly polarized gravitational waves provides the simplest inhomogeneous cosmologies . after a partial gauge fixing",
    ", the reduced system can be regarded as gravitational waves propagating in one axial direction over a bianchi i homogeneous background .",
    "two global constraints remain in the model : a global momentum constraint on the inhomogeneities , and the zero - mode of the hamiltonian constraint , so that the model is not completely deparameterized .",
    "this latter constraint is formed by the hamiltonian constraint of the bianchi i model , plus another term coupling the homogeneous and inhomogeneous sectors .",
    "therefore , the hybrid quantization of this gowdy model combines the quantization of the bianchi i model in lqc @xcite with a fock quantization for the inhomogeneities of the gravitational field .",
    "as usual in field theories , there is an infinite ambiguity in the fock representation chosen to quantize th e field .",
    "remarkably , previous studies on the fock quantization of the completely deparameterized gowdy model proved that two physically natural criteria select a unique ( up to unitary equivalence ) fock representation for the gravitational waves @xcite . in the completely deparameterized model there only remains a field propagating in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime with circular spatial sections .",
    "the criteria needed to single out the representation are : a ) invariance of the vacuum under the symmetries of the background where the field propagates , namely translations in the circle , and b ) unitary implementability of the quantum dynamics .",
    "with this result at hand then , in the hybrid quantization , the same fock representation as in the deparameterized model is chosen .",
    "the hybrid quantization of the @xmath2gowdy cosmology with linear polarization was later extended by including the presence of a massless scalar field with the same symmetries as the geometry @xcite . the main motivation to consider this model is that its homogeneous sector , the bianchi i model with a homogeneous massless scalar , admits as isotropic solutions flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , that at certain scales give a good approximation to the dynamics of our universe . in a convenient parameterization",
    ", the matter field contributes to the constraints in the very same way as the gravitational waves @xcite . as a consequence , the uniqueness results mentioned above for the fock quantization @xcite apply to this nonvacuum case as well , and there is a preferred fock description also for the inhomogeneities of the matter field .",
    "this model has served as a testbed to develop approximation methods to solve the resulting dynamics .",
    "these analyses show that the hybrid gowdy model admits approximate solutions with a remarkable property : even if they are intrinsically inhomogeneous and anisotropic quantum states , they effectively satisfy the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic frw model @xcite , possibly coupled to a perfect fluid @xcite , and with possible modifications to the geometry @xcite . the properties of the frw geometry in lqc , specially the occurrence of the quantum bounce , are at the core of the approximations carried out when constructing such quantum states .",
    "the hybrid approach is of course not limited to the gowdy model , and has been applied as well to more realistic scenarios , such as inflationary frw cosmologies with a scalar field and cosmological fluctuations .",
    "@xciteunlike for the gowdy model , where inhomogeneities are dealt with exactly , here the fluctuations are treated perturbatively and the action of the system is truncated at quadratic order in these perturbations .",
    "again , the zero - mode of the hamiltonian constraint couples the homogeneous sector with the inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore , in this framework the fluctuations are a priori not treated as a test field propagating on a fixed background , but their back - reaction on the background is retained at the considered perturbative order in the action . the perturbed spacetime geometry is treated as a fully quantum entity . remarkably , these analyses can be based on a covariant formulation of the system ( at the perturbative order considered in the truncation ) , inasmuch as no gauge fixing needs to be adopted @xcite .",
    "its hybrid quantization is obtained by employing an lqc representation for the degrees of freedom of the frw geometry @xcite , a schrdinger representation for the zero - mode of the scalar field , and a fock representation for the gauge - invariants that describe the inhomogeneous sector , that contains the mukhanov - sasaki ( ms ) field commonly used in standard cosmology.@xcite    as in the case of the gowdy model , in principle there is an infinite ambiguity in the fock representation chosen to quantize the gauge - invariant fluctuations .",
    "luckily , for this case there exist as well uniqueness results fixing an equivalence class of fock representations .",
    "these are again selected by the criteria of vacuum invariance under the spatial isometries of the background ( that is considered to have compact spatial sections ) and unitary implementability of the quantum dynamics@xcite .",
    "these results are obtained when the homogeneous sector is viewed as a fixed classical background , and the fluctuations as a test quantum field on it , namely , when back - reaction is neglected and only the fluctuations are quantized .",
    "this is the description employed in standard cosmology.@xcite any element of the equivalence class of fock representations selected in this way can be taken to provide the representation for the inhomogeneous sector in the hybrid quantization .    within the hybrid scheme ,",
    "one can analyze the influence of the quantization of the homogeneous sector on the dynamics of the perturbations at the level of truncation adopted in the action .",
    "this can be attained by applying a born - oppenheimer approximation , based on an ansatz for quantum states that separates the dependence on the homogeneous geometry from that on the inhomogeneous degrees of freedom , permitting the variation of both parts with respect to the zero - mode of the matter scalar field .",
    "@xcite in this way one can arrive at a scenario of quantum fields propagating on a quantum - corrected background , often called _ dressed metric _ approach that , under some additional assumptions , like e.g. the choice of a particular adiabatic vacuum , has allowed one to compute quantum gravity corrections to the primordial power spectra @xcite .    the structure of this work is the following . in sec .",

    "in order to present the main construction underlying the hybrid approach in lqc , we detail it for the simplest inhomogeneous cosmologies . these are gowdy midisuperspaces , which are globally hyperbolic spacetimes , with compact spatial sections , and two axial killing vectors @xcite .",
    "the case with three - torus topology for the spatial sections is the simplest one .",
    "we consider this model with linear polarization , namely the two killing vectors are hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "in addition , we couple a massless scalar field with the same symmetries as the geometry . for further details",
    "one can consult ref .",
    ", that in turn builds on the construction for the vacuum model @xcite .",
    "we choose coordinates @xmath3 adapted to the symmetries , such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the killing vectors .",
    "then , the fields describing the model only depend on time and on the spatial coordinate @xmath6 . after performing a symmetry reduction and a partial gauge fixing @xcite",
    ", we obtain a reduced phase space formed by a pair of point - particle degrees of freedom , a gravitational field , and the massless scalar field . using fourier decomposition",
    "we split this phase space in two sectors .",
    "the mentioned point - particle degrees of freedom and the zero - modes of the remaining fields are global modes forming the _ homogeneous sector_. it coincides with the phase space of the bianchi i model coupled to a homogeneous massless scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "the nonzero fourier modes of both the gravitational and matter fields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , form the _",

    "first we describe it in terms of the ashtekar - barbero variables of the bianchi i model with three - torus topology . in an internal diagonal gauge",
    "these variables are given by the three components of the densitized triad @xmath15 and of the @xmath16-connection @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the immirzi parameter and @xmath21 is the newton constant .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the kinematical hilbert space for the bianchi i model in lqc @xcite .",
    "notice that for the zero - mode of the matter field , @xmath7 , we choose a standard schrdinger representation where the canonical conjugate momentum of @xmath7 acts as a derivative , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the planck constant .",
    "the construction of the geometry sector @xmath25 mimics that of lqg in the sense that the connection is not defined in the quantum theory but only its holonomies .",
    "the inner product is discrete , so that the operators @xmath26 have a point spectrum equal to the real line , and their mutual eigenstates @xmath27 form an orthonormal basis of @xmath25 .",
    "we denote the basic holonomy operators proposed in ref . by @xmath28 .",
    "their action on the states @xmath27 is quite involved .",
    "it is convenient to relabel these states as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is proportional to the physical volume of the bianchi i universe , or _ homogeneous _ volume .",
    "the operators @xmath28 scale the label @xmath32 in such a way that the label @xmath33 is simply shifted by one.@xcite    in order to implement a fock quantization of the inhomogeneous sector , we need to single out a preferred fock representation .",
    "the completely deparameterized @xmath2gowdy model with linear polarization has been thoroughly studied and it has been proven that it admits a unique ( up to unitary equivalence ) fock quantization @xcite .",
    "this result is quite relevant , inasmuch as it removes the freedom to choose among the infinite number of inequivalent fock representations that may lead to different physics . refs .",
    "impose natural criteria to select a unique equivalence class of representations .",
    "these criteria consist in imposing vacuum invariance under translations in the circle , that is the symmetry generated by the only constraint present in the totally deparameterized model , @xmath11 , and in demanding that the dynamics can be implemented as a unitary operator in the quantum theory .",
    "unitarity of the dynamics also imposes a concrete parameterization for the nonzero modes of both the gravitational field @xmath8 and the matter field @xmath9 . in this parameterization ,",
    "both fields contribute to the system in the very same way .",
    "then we represent the inhomogeneous sector of our hybrid model choosing the fock space @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) of refs . . an orthonormal basis is given by the _",

    "we can now represent the constraints as operators , densely defined on this hilbert space .",

    "in constructing the quantum hamiltonian constraint , for the operators acting nontrivially on the inhomogeneous sector , we choose , e.g. , normal ordering again.@xcite for the operators acting on the homogeneous sector we choose a convenient symmetrization @xcite . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian constraint operator decouples the states of zero homogeneous volume @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , we can remove from our kinematical theory the states which are the analog of the classical singularity ( those with vanishing @xmath33 ) .",

    "the criteria of imposing invariance of the vacuum under the isometries of the spatial sections of the homogeneous sector , together with demanding a unitary implementability of the dynamics in the quantum theory , select a unique equivalence class of fock representations .",

    "<S> in the framework of loop quantum cosmology , inhomogeneous models are usually quantized by means of a hybrid approach that combines loop quantization techniques with standard quantum field theory methods . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on a splitting of the phase space in a homogeneous sector , formed by global , zero - modes , and an inhomogeneous sector , formed by the remaining , infinite number of modes , that describe the local degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> then , the hybrid quantization is attained by adopting a loop representation for the homogeneous gravitational sector , while a fock representation is used for the inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - mode of the hamiltonian constraint operator couples the homogeneous and inhomogeneous sectors . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid approach , therefore , is expected to provide a suitable quantum theory in regimes where the main quantum effects of the geometry are those affecting the zero - modes , while the inhomogeneities , still being quantum , can be treated in a more conventional way . </S>",
    "<S> this hybrid strategy was first proposed for the simplest cosmological midisuperspaces : the gowdy models , and it has been later applied to the case of cosmological perturbations . </S>",
