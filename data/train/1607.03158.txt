    "electron - impact fine - structure excitation of low charged ions is an important cooling mechanism in most interstellar environments , especially in regions with significant ionization fraction where electron - impact excitation is a strong populating mechanism for the excited states .",
    "the lines from these fine - structure transitions can be observed from the infrared ( ir ) to the submillimeter ( submm ) by a range of telescopes ( e.g. , the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) , the _ herschel space observatory _ , the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , etc . ) .",
    "further , fine - structure excitation due to electron - impact is an important diagnostic tool for the density , pressure , temperature , and/or ambient radiation field , if sufficiently accurate rate coefficients can be obtained .",
    "electron impact fine - structure excitation has been studied fairly extensively for many ions over the past few decades ( pradhan 1974 ; butler & mendoza 1984 ; johnson et al .",

    "; abdel - naby et al . 2013 ; abdel - naby et al . 2015 ) . however , almost all of these studies have primarily focused on high energies / high temperatures relevant to collisionally - ionized plasmas and some of the existing fine - structure excitation rate coefficients in current astrophysical codes are still based on a simple model developed by bahcall & wolf ( 1968 ) , which may lead to inaccurate results .    for the plasmas of importance in this paper , we require rate coefficients down to approximately 10  k , appreciating that achieving the accuracy in the underlying cross section at this temperature is difficult . therefore it is important for astrophysical models that collisional calculations are performed down to lower energies and that the associated rate coefficients are updated .",
    "the fine - structure line emissions , ne ii and ne iii , due to electron - impact excitation of ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath1 , respectively , are observed in the ir and known to be very important for probing h ii regions .",
    "previous work ( glassgold et al . 2007 ; meijerink et al .",
    "2008 ) has proposed that ne ii and ne iii fine - structure lines are appropriate to serve as diagnostics of the source of an evaporative flow , as well as of signatures of x - ray irradiation , so - called x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) .",
    "this is because hard x - rays have sufficient energy to generate multiple ionization states of neon which can then be collisionally excited .",
    "the rate coefficients used in most applications are based on the approximations of bahcall & wolf ( 1968 ) .",
    "however , @xmath2-matrix methods have been available for these and neighboring ion stages of ne .",
    "specifically , collision strengths for the 1s@xmath42s@xmath42p@xmath5 ( @xmath6p@xmath7 ) - ( @xmath6p@xmath8 ) transition of ne@xmath0 have been calculated using a @xmath2-matrix method via the jj omega ( jajom ) approach ( johnson & kingston 1987 ; saraph & tully 1994 ) .",
    "the collision strengths of the transitions among levels of the lowest configurations for ne@xmath1 were evaluated by pradhan ( 1974 ) and butler & mendoza ( 1984 ) , also with an @xmath2-matrix method .",
    "mclaughlin et al . ( 2000 , 2002 ) extended this approach to a large configuration - interaction representation of the target , supplemented by a few extra pseudo - orbitals to improve the target description further . here",
    ", we have re - investigated these two ne ions for several reasons .",
    "previous work has focused primarily on higher electron - impact energies than considered here with only a few of their maxwellian averaged effective collision strengths going below 800 k. this leads naturally to the second focus of the paper , which is the exploration of uncertainty in the rate coefficients at very low temperatures . to this end",
    ", three different theoretical level - resolved @xmath2-matrix approaches have been applied : the intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) approach ( griffin et al . 1998 ) , the breit - pauli ( bp ) approximation ( berrington et al . 1987 ) , and the fully relativistic dirac method ( norrington et al . 1981 ; dyall et al .",
    "obstensively , if the underlying electronic structure adopted in each approach was exactly the same there would be little expectation of differences in the collision strengths .",
    "however , with the use of different atomic structure codes and the choices made in their use , this invariably leads to small differences in a - values and subsequently , dynamical quantities such as collision strengths .",
    "thus , we are interested in the sensitivity of the effective collision strengths to the threshold energy position , the target wave - functions , resonance positions , and anything that can affect the background cross section .",
    "we appreciate that the height and position of a single resonance can dramatically affect the results at these temperatures .",
    "we shall explore the variation in results to threshold energy and resonance positions by calculating collision strengths where the target energies have been shifted ( or not ) to nist energies ( kramida et al .",
    "furthermore , we explore the sensitivity of the target wave - function via different target expansions within the bp @xmath2-matrix , icft @xmath2-matrix , and darc @xmath2-matrix methods . after investigating the differences between all calculated effective collision strengths for the same transition",
    ", we recommend one based upon our findings .",
    "we focus on excitation at low temperatures in this paper .",
    "so for ne@xmath0 , only rates for the transition between the two lowest levels 1s@xmath42s@xmath42p@xmath5 ( @xmath6p@xmath7 ) - ( @xmath6p@xmath8 ) are presented .",
    "also , the transitions between the three lowest fine - structure levels of ne@xmath1 ( see energy diagram in figure [ ne2+_dia ] ) are investigated here .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the three theoretical methods used in this paper .",
    "the calculated results , target energies , einstein a coefficients , collision strengths , effective collision strengths and excitation rate coefficients for ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath1 will be discussed in sec .",
    "3 . sec . 4",
    "provides a summary of the results .",
    "level - resolved electron - impact excitation calculations using @xmath2-matrix theory , employs a similar formalism whether semi - relativistic or relativistic implementations are used .",
    "ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath1 are not highly charged , therefore both semi - relativistic and fully relativistic methods are equally applicable .",
    "the main differences arise from the choices made in the determination of the target orbitals .",
    "the atomic structure code autostructure ( badnell 1986 ) generates non - relativistic orbitals whereas the general relativistic atomic structure package ( grasp ; dyall et al . 1989 ) formulates and diagonalizes a dirac - coulomb hamiltonian to produce the relativistic orbitals .",
    "the former is used in the bp / icft ( berrington et al .",
    "1995 ) collisional calculations and the latter in the dirac atomic @xmath2-matrix code ( darc ; chang 1975 ; norrington & grant 1981 ) calculations .",
    "the bp @xmath2-matrix method is a set of parallel codes developed from modified serial versions of the rmatrx  i codes ( berrington et al .",
    "both the bp and icft models recouple underlying @xmath9 coupling calculations , the former transforms several @xmath9-resolved hamiltonians into a @xmath10-coupled hamiltonian , pre - diagonalisation , as opposed to the icft approach that transforms unphysical @xmath9-resolved @xmath11-matrices into level - resolved collision strengths . in general there has been very good agreement between the icft and bp @xmath2-matrix methods ( griffin et al . 1998 ; munoz burgos et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the implementation of various flavours of @xmath2-matrix theory are used in this study .",
    "the review book of burke ( burke 2011 ) provides an excellent overview of non - relativistic ( @xmath9 coupling ) , semi - relativistic ( bp / icft ) and relativistic ( darc ) electron - impact excitation .",
    "the comparison of bp and icft results benefits from the use of a completely consistent atomic structure as opposed to multiconfiguration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) results from grasp , though in all cases every effort has been made to optimize the orbitals on the fine - structure levels of the ground term .",
    "the darc calculation employs relativistic orbitals from the initial atomic structure calculations throughout the remainder of the computation .",
    "it should be restated that low temperature astrophysical constraints on both our ne systems means we are pursuing only transitions between the fine - structure levels of the ground term , and that any excited states are included for the main purpose of improving the energy levels of those low - lying states through configuration interaction .",
    "given that the energy separation between the ground state @xmath12 and the excited @xmath13 levels for either ne@xmath0 or ne@xmath1 exceeds 2 ryd . , it is unlikely that rydberg states attached to the @xmath13 levels would perturb our @xmath12 results .",
    "given the low temperature focus of this paper , only small scale calculations are required for the fine - structure transitions within the ground term . furthermore , we would like to explore the variation of our results in relation to various configuration - interaction ( ci ) expansions .",
    "thus , we consider both a small and larger ci expansion for ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath1 , with the configurations described in table [ target ] .",

    ", we only perform calculations for one target expansion , and the included configurations are the same as bp / darc @xmath13 .",
    "this will be used to explore the difference between the bp and icft methods .",

    "we use the thomas - fermi - dirac - amaldi potential , with appropriate scaling parameters .",
    "the orbital scaling parameters are @xmath14=1.0 , @xmath15=1.3 , @xmath16=1.09 , @xmath17=1.13 , @xmath18=1.15 , @xmath19=1.11 for ne@xmath1 , taken from mclaughlin et al .",
    "we refer to these calculations as bp(op ) @xmath20 and icft(op ) @xmath13 in the following sections .      here",
    "we only present details specific to the current @xmath2-matrix calculations .",
    "the radius of the @xmath2-matrix sphere used for ne@xmath0 is 5.40 a.u . for darc @xmath12 , 19.83 a.u . for darc @xmath13 , 5.87 a.u . for bp @xmath12 , and 21.60 a.u .",
    "for bp @xmath13 .",

    "20 continuum basis orbitals for each angular momentum are chosen for bp / bp(op)/darc @xmath12 for both ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath1 , which is more than sufficient to converge the results for the low temperature calculations .",
    "all of our models include partial waves from @xmath21 to 10 , which is more than sufficient to converge the cross sections for the energy region for our calculations .",
    "an energy mesh of 2.5@xmath2210@xmath23 rydbergs for ne@xmath0 and 3.125@xmath2210@xmath23 rydbergs for ne@xmath1 ensured resonances were resolved , particularly for the lowest temperatures of subsequent effective collision strengths .",
    "we calculate collision strengths up to 0.107 ryd . for ne@xmath0 and 0.1658",
    "ryd . for ne@xmath1 , and effective collision strengths from 10 - 2000 k for both ions .",
    "all these parameters are listed in table [ parameter ]      the effective collision strength ( seaton 1953 ; eissner et al .",
    "1969 ) can be calculated from the collision strengths via : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the collision strength for the transition from level @xmath26 to @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the energy of the scattered electron , @xmath29 the electron temperature , and @xmath30 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the maxwellian excitation rate coefficient @xmath3 is the coefficient used widely in astrophysics .",
    "the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath34 the speed of light , @xmath35 the bohr radius , @xmath36 the hydrogen ionization potential , @xmath37 the energy difference in the fine - structure levels , and @xmath38 the degeneracy in the lower level .",
    "compared with @xmath3(@xmath29 ) , @xmath39(@xmath29 ) is a smoother function and can be more accurately interpolated .",
    "astrophysical plasma modelers who study ir / submm observations of low temperature plasmas , such as the interstellar medium , require atomic rate coefficients down to temperatures as low as 10 k. this will place very stringent tests on the accuracy of the atomic structure and collisional calculations .",
    "the excitation rate coefficients will be very sensitive to small changes in the atomic structure . as a result , the structure will impact the rate coefficients through changes in the threshold energy , resonance strengths and positions , and changes in the background cross section .",
    "for this reason , we have performed a range of calculations using different methods ( bp @xmath12 , darc @xmath12 , bp @xmath13 , darc @xmath13 , bp(op ) @xmath13 ) .",
    "these will be used to explore the variation of the effective collision strengths , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "the purpose of including the @xmath13 configurations is to improve the energies and transition probabilities for the levels within the ground term .",
    "our recommended dataset shall be the model that minimizes the difference between that calculation and the nist a - values and level energies ( kramida et al .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ energy ] and [ a - value ] . the percent error shown",
    "is calculated by @xmath40@xmath22@xmath41 with the nist data providing the accepted values .    the bp / darc @xmath12 and @xmath13 target expansions give rise to 3 and 108 levels for ne@xmath0 , and 10 and 226 levels for ne@xmath1 .",
    "the energies for the levels within the ground term are presented in table [ energy ] and the associated a - values in table [ a - value ] . in general , the percent errors show that the agreement between theoretical and nist values is reasonable . the @xmath13 target expansion results in marginally better energies for both ions and different @xmath2-matrix methods compared to the @xmath12 expansion . for ne@xmath0 , the average percentage error for the bp @xmath12 , bp @xmath13 , darc @xmath12 , and drac @xmath13 target expansions are 1.41% , 0.96% , 3.6% and 0.42% , respectively .",
    "while for ne@xmath1 , the corresponding average percent errors for target energies are 8.13% , 6.95% , 3.72% and 3.33% .    optimized bp calculations are also performed for ne@xmath1 , giving average percentage errors of 3.34% for bp(op ) @xmath12 and 3.20% for bp(op )",
    "the darc @xmath2-matrix method produces better energies than the bp @xmath2-matrix method for ne@xmath1 for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the optimized bp calculation for ne@xmath1 dramatically increases the accuracy of the energies .",

    "the darc @xmath12 calculations produce the closest agreement with nist values .",
    "the remainder of the dataset shall be used to gauge the variation between the different calculations .",
    "the accuracy of the einstein a coefficient is not only related to the precision of the target energies , but also depends on the reliability of the target wave - functions .",
    "the optimized bp @xmath13 calculation does give better target energies and a - values compared with the bp(op ) @xmath12 , showing an improvement with ci expansion .",
    "this trend is not reflected in the darc results , see tables [ energy ] and [ a - value ] .",
    "we conclude that our recommended dataset is the darc @xmath12 calculation which has the most accurate target energies and a - values , and will provide the most accurate collision strengths , effective collision strengths and excitation rate coefficients .",
    "we also investigated the differences between an icft(op ) and the bp(op ) calculation for ne@xmath1 using the same structure , noticing no differences in the effective collision strengths .      to our knowledge , there are no experimental results for the collision strengths for transitions within the ground complex for either of these ion stages .",
    "our goal is to determine the variation in effective collision strengths between our best models as we progress to the very low temperatures required by the astrophysical applications .",
    "we have adopted two different approaches to calculating meaningful representative percent differences in our work .    in the first approach",
    "we calculate a percentage uncertainty on the effective collision strengths simply using the standard deviation of our three most accurate models as determined from the accuracy of the energy levels and the associated a - values , given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the standard deviation .",
    "secondly , we obtain a percent difference comparing results from our semi - relativistic and fully - relativistic @xmath2-matrix methods employing exactly the same set of non - relativistic target configurations . in this case , the percentage difference is calculated by the formula @xmath44@xmath22100@xmath45",

    "sampling a range of calculations allows us to more objectively explore the variation of collision strength in regards to the size of the different ci expansions .",
    "as stated earlier , the sizeable energy separation between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels precludes the possibility of interloping resonances attached to the @xmath13 levels perturbing the cross sections from transitions amongst the @xmath12 levels .",
    "the influence of resonance contributions to effective collision strengths is only expected for the case of ne@xmath1 due the 2p@xmath46 subshell supporting 3 levels within the ground state complex , whereas the resonances attached to the upper @xmath47 levels of ne@xmath48(2p@xmath5 ) lie in the elastic cross section of the ne@xmath48 ground state .",
    "figure [ ne+ ] shows collision strengths ( top ) and effective collision strengths ( bottom ) for the ne@xmath0 2s@xmath42p@xmath5(@xmath6p@xmath7 ) - ( @xmath6p@xmath8 ) transition .",
    "the largest collision strengths are from the bp @xmath12 calculation , the next lower one is from the darc @xmath12 calculation , then from bp @xmath13 and darc @xmath13 .",
    "the darc @xmath12 calculation is our recommended data set based upon a - value comparisons with the nist database values .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of experiment , the mcdf approach would be our recommended theoretical model .",
    "subsequent effective collision strengths were generated from the respective collision strengths of each calculation .",
    "we note that beyond the current work , a previous large - scale bp @xmath2-matrix calculation for ne@xmath0 has been carried out griffin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . however , the focus of that work was to provide a large comprehensive data set across a wide range of temperatures , but not at the very low temperatures required by our study . at 1000 and 2000",
    "k , the darc @xmath12 effective collision strengths were in best agreement with this previous work .",

    "the uncertainty are the bp @xmath12 , bp @xmath13 , and the darc @xmath12 results , providing an uncertainty from 19.1 - 19.6@xmath45 for our recommended darc @xmath12 effective collision strengths , as shown in figure [ ne+ ] .",

    "we note that , perhaps counterintuitively , the darc @xmath13 results drift from the recommended values , however the explanation lies in the fact that the darc code will endeavour to optimise all orbitals on an equal footing , when in fact we should focus only on the @xmath12 optimisation at the expense of the @xmath13 levels .",

    "<S> collision strengths for electron - impact of fine - structure level excitation within the ground term of ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath1 are calculated using the breit - pauli , intermediate coupling frame transformation , and darc @xmath2-matrix methods . </S>",
    "<S> maxwellian - averaged effective collision strengths and excitation rate coefficient @xmath3 are presented for each . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the current calculations is to very low temperature astrophysical plasmas , thus we examine the sensitivity of the effective collision strengths down to 10 k. the use of the various theoretical methods allows us to place estimated uncertainties on the recommended effective collision strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the sensitivity of the collision strengths to the resonance positions and underlying atomic structure . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is found with previous @xmath2-matrix calculations at higher temperature . </S>"
