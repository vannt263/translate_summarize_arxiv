    "the sensitivity of one - dimensional ( 1d ) correlated electron systems  so called luttinger liquids ( ll ) @xcite  to local single - particle inhomogeneities ( e.g.  a single impurity ) leading to a ( back- ) scattering of electrons with momentum transfer @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 being the fermi momentum ) was recognized several decades ago @xcite .",
    "the density - density response function at zero frequency shows a power - law singularity when the momentum transfer @xmath2 approaches @xmath0 with an exponent determined by the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath3 ( for repulsive interactions ; @xmath4 in the noninteracting case ) .",
    "it was computed for a specific field - theoretical model  the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model  after mapping the interacting fermionic problem onto a free bosonic hamiltonian using the bosonization method @xcite .",
    "the tl model is known to describe the low - energy physics of a large class of 1d metals @xcite .    at the beginning of the 90 s it became apparent that the realization of sufficiently well defined 1d quantum wires and thus the possibility to experimentally investigate ll physics",
    "would only be a matter of a few more years of research .",
    "this was one of the reasons for a renewed theoretical interest in such systems .",
    "the understanding of the role of local impurities was further sharpened by renormalization group ( rg ) studies within the bosonized model @xcite . in these studies",
    "the tl model was supplemented in two ways . in a first step a term solely describing the @xmath1 to @xmath5 ( and vice versa ) backscattering ( of amplitude @xmath6 )",
    "was added to the hamiltonian . using bosonization",
    "this leads to a term @xmath7}$ ] , with @xmath8 being the bosonic field and @xmath9 the position of the impurity .",
    "the resulting field - theoretical model is known as the local sine - gordon model . in a rg procedure perturbative in @xmath6",
    "it was shown that @xmath6 grows and is thus a relevant perturbation ( for repulsive interactions with @xmath3 ) . at a sufficiently low energy scale",
    "the perturbative rg breaks down . in a second step",
    "the opposite case of two semi - infinite tl chains with a weak link of amplitude @xmath10 was studied .",
    "this was shown to scale to zero .",
    "based on these insights and an exact solution at @xmath11 it was speculated that for repulsive interactions even a weak single impurity will scale towards the strong impurity limit implying that at low energies observables show power - law scaling with exponents characterized by the scaling dimension of the `` open chain fixed point '' @xmath12 . e.g.  the local spectral function @xmath13 close to the impurity will vanish as @xmath14 and the conductance @xmath15 across the impurity as @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the temperature . for small @xmath6 the corrections to `` perfect '' @xmath18 conductance @xcite",
    "are given by the scaling dimension @xmath19 of the ( unstable ) `` perfect chain fixed point '' , @xmath20 within the local sine - gordon model the above conjecture was later confirmed using numerical @xcite and exact @xcite methods .",
    "the physics of spinless inhomogeneous lls and systems with spin is quite similar in many respects and for simplicity we here mainly focus on the spinless case .",
    "the scaling exponents just given are slightly different if the spin is included . towards the end of this article",
    "we briefly explain how the spin can be included in the two fermionic rg approaches described here and discuss a novel feature which results from it .    in parallel to the bosonization approach",
    "a fermionic poor man s rg method was developed which does not rely on the mapping onto a bosonic field theory @xcite . in this approach",
    "the single - particle impurity scattering problem is first solved exactly within the 1d electron gas model .",
    "next , the hartree and fock terms [ leading order perturbation theory in the two - particle interaction @xmath21 are computed with the scattering states .",
    "the hartree diagram produces a potential term which oscillates as @xmath22 , decays as @xmath23 , and has a prefactor given by the reflection amplitude of the ( bare ) impurity . scattering off",
    "the hartree potential leads to a logarithmically diverging correction to the transmission amplitude @xmath24 if @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a characteristic spatial scale of the interaction and @xmath28 is the relevant amplitude of the ( fourier transform of the ) interaction , with @xmath29 being the fermi velocity .",
    "the authors argue that one can iterate this procedure and produce divergent terms of higher order @xmath30^n$ ] .    to resum these terms a real space rg method is suggested . at scale",
    "@xmath31 the scattering potential @xmath32 is considered only for @xmath33 $ ] with a spatial cutoff @xmath34 .",
    "this way the logarithmic divergence is regularized .",
    "then the region @xmath35 $ ] with its renormalized reflection and transmission amplitudes is viewed as an effective barrier from which the hartree potential and the fock term for the region outside @xmath35 $ ] can be computed .",
    "one next considers @xmath36 and iterates the above steps .",
    "this leads to a single differential equation for the transmission amplitude at momentum @xmath1 . for the following analysis it is essential to note that the nontrivial spatial dependence of the scattering potential at each step is @xmath32 and does not change during the rg procedure",
    "it was argued that , in contrast to the bosonic rg method which is perturbative in the impurity strength , this fermionic procedure , although being applicable only for sufficiently small @xmath37 ( weak two - particle interaction ) , can be used to describe the full crossover from the weak to the strong impurity limit .",
    "further down we challenge this statement .",
    "a detailed analysis for the single impurity case shows that the poor man s approach heavily relies on a subtle relation between the scaling dimensions of the `` perfect '' and `` open chain fixed points '' .",
    "the method is commonly regarded as being very intuitive and has been generalized to study transport through two barriers ( resonant tunneling ) @xcite , through y - junctions of three lls @xcite , and through regular networks of lls @xcite as well as transport across a ll - superconductor junction @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the lack of a formal framework from which the poor man s flow equations can be deduced led to a dispute about their correct form for the double barrier case @xcite .    in both the fermionic rg as well as the field - theoretical description only the scaling of the backscattering amplitude @xmath38 ( and vice versa )",
    "was considered .",
    "undoubtedly the backscattering component @xmath39 of a general scattering potential with matrix elements @xmath40 is ( i ) the one which grows the fastest when the infrared cutoff @xmath41 is lowered and is ( ii ) the component which at the end of the rg flow determines the conductance across the impurity .",
    "but in more elaborate rg procedures all scattering channels @xmath42 will couple and also the amplitudes @xmath40 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 not equal to @xmath45 will grow .",
    "even if the matrix elements with momentum transfer different from @xmath0 are absent in the original hamiltonian generically they will be generated during the rg procedure .",
    "one might speculate that this feedback will lead to intermediate fixed points not captured by the local sine - gordon model ( as no other matrix elements than @xmath46 are kept in the model ) and the poor man s rg ( as the feedback is neglected ) .",
    "motivated by this reasoning an alternative fermionic rg procedure was developed starting from the rather general functional rg ( frg ) framework @xcite .",
    "it allows for a description of the full functional form of the renormalized effective impurity potential .",
    "using truncated frg flow equations it was shown that indeed _ no _ intermediate fixed points are realized @xcite . as a further advantage",
    "this rg method can directly be applied to microscopic lattice models and does not require a mapping onto the 1d electron gas or an effective field theory .",
    "it is rather straightforward to extend the frg approach to study resonant transport through a double barrier @xcite , transport through a wire with three and four impurities @xcite , and junctions of more than two lls @xcite .    in the frg formalism one",
    "derives an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential flow equations for the cutoff dependent one - particle irreducible vertex functions .",
    "in practical applications this hierarchy must be truncated . to study the physics of local inhomogeneities in spinless",
    "lls up to leading order in the two - particle interaction it is sufficient to keep the flow of the frequency independent self - energy ( one - particle vertex ) @xcite .",
    "the quantitative agreement to the results derived by bosonization in the limits of weak and strong impurities as well as to numerical results obtained for small systems can be improved if the flow of the static part of the effective two - particle interaction ( two - particle vertex ) is kept @xcite .",
    "details are given below .",
    "the frequency independent self - energy can be interpreted as an effective , renormalized impurity potential . for strong bare impurities",
    "it spatially oscillates with frequency @xmath47 and decays as the inverse distance from the inhomogeneity up to a scale @xmath48 , beyond which it dies off exponentially . scattering off this effective impurity",
    "then leads to the power - law decay of the conductance as a function of @xmath17 . for weak bare impurities and not too low temperatures",
    "the oscillatory effective potential only decays with exponent @xmath19 . for lower temperatures a crossover to the strong impurity behavior",
    "can be observed and the system flows to the `` open chain fixed point '' .",
    "below we give more details on the truncated frg procedure and the basic equations for the poor man s rg ( sec .",
    "[ methods ] ) .",
    "we discuss the most important results and compare the outcomes of the two fermionic rg approaches ( sec .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the truncated frg can be used to describe the full crossover from the weak to the strong impurity limits while the poor man s rg seems to have difficulties close to the `` perfect chain fixed point '' .",
    "we show that a single rg equation  as derived in the poor man s",
    "rg for the effective transmission at momentum @xmath1  is in general not enough to describe the crossover behavior .",
    "we then briefly comment on how the spin degree of freedom is included in both methods ( sec .",
    "[ spin ] ) . finally , the comparison of the two fermionic rg methods for the single impurity case is summed up and briefly extended to y - junctions of three lls ( sec .  [ summary ] ) . in the appendix we discuss the additional approximations necessary to derive the poor man s rg equation within the frg framework .",
    "in this section we present the basic equations of the frg approach and the poor man s rg .",
    "we focus on the simplest situation of a single impurity in an otherwise `` perfect '' chain which is coupled `` adiabatically '' to two semi - infinite noninteracting leads @xcite .",
    "the frg was recently introduced as a powerful new tool for studying interacting fermi systems @xcite .",
    "it provides a systematic way of resumming competing instabilities and goes beyond simple perturbation theory even in problems which are not plagued by infrared divergences . in our application the interacting quantum wire will be coupled to noninteracting leads as it is the case in systems which can be realized in experiments .",
    "the leads are modeled as 1d tight - binding chains with hopping matrix element @xmath49 .",
    "as we are interested in the effect of a single impurity in the bulk part of the wire and not the role of the contacts the latter are modeled as being perfect , that is the conductance through the interacting system of length @xmath50 in the absence of the impurity is @xmath51 ( up to our numerical accuracy ) .",
    "this implies that the interaction must be turned on spatially smoothly close to the contacts ( `` adiabatic contacts '' ) @xcite . before setting up the frg scheme we integrate out the noninteracting leads using a standard projection technique so that we only have to deal with an interacting system of size @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the energy scale @xmath52 related to the length of the interacting part will provide an infrared cutoff for power - law scaling as a function of other energy variables .    in the frg procedure",

    "the flow of the self - energy ( one - particle vertex ) is determined by @xmath66 itself and the two - particle vertex , while the flow of @xmath67 is determined by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and the flowing three - particle vertex @xmath68 .",

    "@xcite .    in practical applications",
    "the hierarchy of flow equations has to be truncated and @xmath69 only provides an approximation for the exact @xmath70 . as a first approximation we neglect the three - particle vertex .",
    "the contribution of @xmath68 to @xmath67 is small as long as @xmath67 is small , because @xmath68 is initially ( at @xmath71 ) zero and is generated only from terms of third order in @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath67 stays small for all @xmath41 if the bare interaction is not too large .",
    "this approximation leads to a closed set of equations for @xmath67 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we here do not give these equations but instead implement a second approximation : the frequency dependent flow of the renormalized two - particle vertex @xmath67 is replaced by its value at vanishing external frequencies , such that @xmath67 and hence @xmath72 remains frequency independent . since the bare interaction is frequency independent , neglecting the frequency dependence leads to errors only at second order for the self - energy , and at third order for the two - particle vertex at zero frequency .",

    "<S> we compare two fermionic renormalization group methods which have been used to investigate the electronic transport properties of one - dimensional metals with two - particle interaction ( luttinger liquids ) and local inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a poor man s method setup to resum `` leading - log '' divergences of the effective transmission at the fermi momentum . </S>",
    "<S> generically the resulting equations can be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the second approach is based on the functional renormalization group method and leads to a set of differential equations which can only for certain setups and in limiting cases be solved analytically , while in general it must be integrated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> both methods are claimed to be applicable for inhomogeneities of arbitrary strength and to capture effects of the two - particle interaction , such as interaction dependent exponents , up to leading order . </S>",
    "<S> we critically review this for the simplest case of a single impurity . </S>",
    "<S> while on first glance the poor man s approach seems to describe the crossover from the `` perfect '' to the `` open chain fixed point '' we collect evidence that difficulties may arise close to the `` perfect chain fixed point '' . due to a subtle relation between the scaling dimensions of the two fixed points </S>",
    "<S> this becomes apparent only in a detailed analysis . in the functional renormalization group method the coupling of the different scattering channels </S>",
