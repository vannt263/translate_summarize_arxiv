    "the family of iron oxyarsenide @xmath5feaso@xmath6f@xmath7 ( @xmath5 = lanthanide element ) exhibits superconductivity with a maximum @xmath8 up to 56 k @xcite . additionally , the iron - arsenide compounds @xmath9fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath9 = alkaline earth element ) , crystallizing in the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type structure , are known to become superconducting with @xmath8 s up to 38 k upon alkali metal substitution for the @xmath9 element @xcite , or partial transition metal substitution for fe @xcite .",
    "in contrast to undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 with a magnetic ground state , superconductivity with relatively low @xmath8 s was reported in the undoped alkali metal iron - arsenides kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath10 k ) and csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath1 k ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is known to exist as well @xcite , although its physical properties have not been reported so far . here",

    "a relative shift of the onset of superconductivity of 0.15 k is observed . an additional magnetic moment in the normal state in the 200 mt measurement , originates from a major normal state magnetic contribution . ]",
    "polycrystalline samples of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 were synthesized in two steps . first , rbas and fe@xmath0as were prepared from pure elements in evacuated and sealed silica tubes . then , appropriate amounts of rbas and fe@xmath0as were mixed , pressed into pellets and annealed at 650 @xmath12c for several days in evacuated and sealed silica ampoules .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction analysis revealed , that the synthesized rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is single phase material with lattice parameters @xmath13   and @xmath14  .",

    "a polycrystalline sample of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 was studied for its low temperature magnetic properties . in fig .",
    "1 the magnetic moment in the field - cooled state ( fc ) and in the zero - field cooled state ( zfc ) in a magnetic field of 1 mt are shown .",
    "the data are indicative of bulk superconductivity .",
    "the distinct onset of diamagnetism due to superconductivity is observed at @xmath11 k. due to the limited temperature range of the equipment , the full development of the meissner state could not be recorded .",
    "nevertheless , the observed zfc diamagnetic response mirrors bulk superconductivity and is consistent with the sample dimensions . the pronounced difference between the zfc and fc curves stemms from remarkable flux - pinning in the sample , suggesting rather high critical current density .",
    "+ the upper critical field @xmath15 was estimated from magnetization measurements performed at various magnetic fields in the mixed state . in fig . 2 ,",
    "two representative measurements of the magnetic moment versus temperature are displayed for @xmath16 mt and for @xmath17 mt . we defined the upper critical field @xmath15 as the magnetic field @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is located .",
    "an obvious shift of the onset of superconductivity of 0.15 k is observed between the respective fields .",
    "in addition to the diamagnetic signal due to superconductivity , a distinct paramagnetic response develops due to the normal state magnetic contribution , rendering an accurate determination of @xmath2 rather difficult . nevertheless ,",
    "since a clear downward curvature is observed due to the onset of superconducting diamagnetism , the trend of @xmath2 can be followed down to 2 k. figure 3 shows a summary of the results up to a field of 0.8 t , anticipating a linear slope close to @xmath8 of @xmath3 t / k . assuming a simple whh temperature dependence @xcite , which is known not to be applicable for the fe pnictide superconductors with much higher transition temperatures",
    ", one would extrapolate @xmath4 t , in comparision to the lower critical field @xmath20 mt , as we estimated from field dependent initial magnetization curves , and the thermodynamic critical field @xmath21 mt .",
    "superconductivity is , obviously , of type ii .",
    "+ the solid solution ( rb , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 offers a particularly simple example where the interrelation between magnetic and superconducting ground states in the fe pnictides can be studied through the controlled shift of the fermi level .",
    "bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 shows antiferromagnetic ordering competing with superconducting state .",
    "appearently , doping of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with ba leads to a natural picture of enhancing @xmath8 in the superconducting state , as the charge carrier concentration is varied .",
    "the appearence of superconductivity in rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 opens up the window for a new interpretation of the occurence of superconducting state in ( rb , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .     for rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath4 t is made using the whh - approach . ]",
    "superconductivity is observed in undoped rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with a @xmath11 k. in this sense , it is useful to consider rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 as a superconductor , located at the opposite end to the nonsuperconducting compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 in the ( rb , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system",
