    "during the last decades , the micromechanics of heterogeneous materials , which is an area of very fertile research at the boundary between physics and mechanics of materials , evolved from the so - called mean - field approaches  @xcite to full - field schemes such as finite element method ( fem )  @xcite or more recently fast fourier transforms ( fft ) methods initiated by moulinec and suquet  @xcite .",
    "the aim of these approaches is to predict the local and the effective behaviors of materials which are strongly influenced by their microstructure ( constituents properties , volume fractions , shapes , orientations , etc . ) .",
    "in reinforced composite materials , inclusions can have several morphologies with different geometrical orientations . to accurately describe the effective behavior of such materials , a highly detailed description of the microstructures",
    "is required .",
    "the full - field approach used in this paper is the fast fourier transform - based ( fftb ) homogenization technique  @xcite where an iterative scheme is used for computing effective properties of each given rve .",
    "one of the main advantages of this approach is its low time and memory consumption in comparison for example with finite element method .",
    "the application of the fftb methods to the study of the overall behavior of materials involves a preliminary step of 3d rve generation .",
    "another important feature of this method is that the generated rve well approximates , at least in certain aspects , the real microstructure of the material .",
    "mean - field homogenization methods rely on a statistical analysis of the microstructure .",
    "several mean - field homogenization models have been developed for predicting the mechanical properties of ellipsoidal fibers reinforced composites ( as well as spherical particles reinforced composites ) , such as the dilute solution of eshelby  @xcite , the hashin shtrikman bounds  @xcite , the self - consistent scheme  @xcite , the mori - tanaka model  @xcite and lielensmodel  @xcite , among others .",
    "several works were conducted to highlight the validity domains of these mean - field micromechanical models ( by comparing them to full - field approaches ) when predicting the elastic properties of various rves with different microstructures .",
    "most of these studies have been focused on spherical particles reinforced composites  @xcite , aligned fibers reinforced composites  @xcite , randomly oriented fiber reinforced composites  @xcite or microstructures with aligned or randomly oriented clay platelets  @xcite .",
    "this work deals with spherical particles and ellipsodal fibers reinforced composites and is extended to microstructures consisting of both shapes within the same rve . in the mean - field approaches , these different shapes ( sphere and ellipsoid ) were taken into account via the eshelby s tensor .",
    "eshelby @xcite has shown that the strain field within a homogeneous ellipsoidal inclusion in an infinite elastic matrix is uniform , if the eigenstrain in the inclusion is uniform .",
    "he also stated that among finite inclusions the ellipsoidal alone has this convenient property .",
    "the absence of the eshelby s property for non - ellipsoidal property was confirmed by lubada and markenscoff @xcite .",
    "many works @xcite have been conducted considering complex shapes ( non - ellipsoidal ) using different eshelby s tensors but these latter were limited to 2d problems .",
    "thus , only spherical and ellipsoidal inclusions ( and a mixture ) were investigated in this paper , as we are interested in 3d volumes .",
    "the effective material properties obtained using the numerical fftb homogenization techniques were compared with three different analytical methods : the normalized self - consistent scheme ( nsc )  @xcite , the mori - tanaka model ( mt )  @xcite and lielens model  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the inclusions morphology on the accuracy of these homogenization techniques to predict the mechanical properties of reinforced composites was investigated .",
    "since the fftb method requires a complete description of the rves , the numerical results obtained with this method have been considered as baseline data to quantify the discrepancies with analytical methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section briefly recalls the rve generation methods proposed in  @xcite .",
    "then , we present the fft - based homogenization technique and the mean - field homogenization models used in this work . afterwards , effective properties predicted by analytical models are compared to those obtained numerically in order to rigorously validate the investigated models and to highlight the influence of the inclusion volume fraction on their accuracy and their sensibility to the inclusions geometrical orientation .",
    "representative volume elements are a powerful tool to model media with inhomogeneities .",
    "it consists of a representative pattern the size of which must respect several criteria .",
    "it can be defined as a volume @xmath0 large enough to provide accurate informations on the microstructure of the medium  @xcite but also not too big to remain elementary and limit the computation cost and respect a minimum scale ratio with the macroscopic material  @xcite .",
    "generating digital samples for computation is a key step in the process of modelling of the behavior of composite materials .",
    "taking into account the morphology of composites is rather a complex task and this is a nice challenge to design an algorithm to model the network and shape of inclusions . on the one hand",
    ", the algorithm should be able to approach rather complex geometries ; on the other hand the algorithm has to be reliable and fast enough . roughly speaking the generation step must be shorter than the computation of the effective mechanical properties in itself .",
    "many studies were conducted with inclusions represented by simple geometric objects like spheres or ellipsoids ( see for example ,  @xcite ) . for more complicated geometry , which is a challenging task ,",
    "the problem is how to manage the intersection between inclusions .",
    "several approaches which are less or more efficient for various geometries can be adopted to generate an rve . historically the first one is known as rsa which stands for random sequental adsorption ( rsa , see for example @xcite ) - a series of parameters of the geometry are randomly generated and some verifications are made on these parameters to satisfy some imposed constraints like interections .",
    "practically , the algorithm starts with an empty box in which all the inclusions are added one after the other while rejecting those that do not satisfy the constraint of non - intersection . in the case of the rsa algorithm ,",
    "the process is usually achieved at low volume fraction of inclusions , otherwise the generating process may take some time or even get stuck while the rve is still far from the desired fraction voume inclusions .",
    "the rsa method needs an efficient algorithm in order to verify intersection between the geometric objects whereas the second method based on molecular dynamics necessitates an algorithm to predict the time of intersection of moving objects , which exists for a very limited class of shapes and often amounts to a difficult minimization problem .",
    "more description for interested reader on the classical rsa and a time - driven version of md applied to the mixture of inclusions of spherical and cylindrical shapes can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the key point in both approaches is the explicit formulation of algebraic conditions of intersection of a cylinder with a sphere and of two cylinders .",
    "algorithm 1 in  @xcite )    the rsa approach is extremely efficient for relatively small volume fractions of inclusions ( up to @xmath1 ) .",
    "the md - based method is powerful for higher volume fractions ( of order @xmath2 ) : md generates a configuration in about a second whereas the rsa can get stuck .",
    "figure [ fig : rve3d ] exhibits two samples with a mixture of non - intersecting spherical - cylindrical and spherical - ellipsoidal inclusions .",
    "3d view of a generated rve : spherical - cylindrical and spherical - ellipsoidal inclusions with periodic boundary conditions.,title=\"fig : \" ]   3d view of a generated rve : spherical - cylindrical and spherical - ellipsoidal inclusions with periodic boundary conditions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the outcome of these algorithms is a list of data of all inclusions such as coordinates of centers , radii , and eventually axes of symmetry of inclusions .",
    "this is appropriate for fft - based homogenization procedures applied to the pixelized samples , as well as finite element computations on the mesh constructed from this pixelization .    in the case of molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "another approach is used : basically , in the first step , all inclusions are added simultaneously and they are allowed to interact with each other , which means that the principle of non - intersecting is violated .",
    "the algorithm starts moving the inclusions such that they get their right place in the box so that all the inclusions satisfy the non - intersecting contraint . in @xcite we explain how the above mentioned methods can be used in order to generate the rves with cylindrical and spherical inclusions .",
    "we describe in details the random generation of non - intersecting inclusions , as well as the relaxation procedure allowing us to produce non - intersecting configurations from the intersecting ones .",
    "the section 2 in @xcite focuses on the intersection conditions of two kinds of geometries : sphere with cylinder and the case of two cylinders .",
    "moreover the format of the output of the algorithms is very convenient , namely all the information about the rve are encoded in the concise vector form .",
    "we can on the one hand pixelize it to have a natural discretization of the analyzed sample , and on the other hand keep track of orientations of the inclusions .    in the sequel , in the prospect of a large number of rves we have chosen to generate them with the help of rsa or md based procedures .",
    "the inclusion network is generated according to different morphological features such as the orientation , the aspect ratio or the dispersion of ellipsoids .",
    "the previous paragraph has briefly presented the two main procedures to generate rves . considering an efficient scheme to generate samples of rves we can now proceed to the evaluation of the effective mechanical properties of reinforced composites . in practice , we set some parameters of the material such as volume fraction , shape of inclusion like spheres , ellispoids and the aspect ratio of inclusion .",
    "we then generate a database of samples of rves of composite material with these parameters .",
    "one should keep in mind that all these parameters can be randomly managed .",
    "thereafter one can perform an accurate computation of the effective properties on this database of rves with the help of a deterministic homogenization technic either using a classical finite element method analysis for example or solving the lippmann - schinger equation with the fft technique for instance . in the sequel and in the present study",
    ", we focus on particular rves for each different situation examined and for which the rves are supposed to be a typical sample that can be encountered in practical situations .",
    "let us now describe the homogenization procedure .",
    "let @xmath0 be a volume element , and let us note @xmath3 the displacement field defined at any point @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the strain tensor in the model of small deformations , and let @xmath6 be the stress tensor , subject to the condition @xmath7 . in the linear case we have @xmath8 with the stiffness tensor @xmath9 .",
    "+ note that for a composite material , the stiffness tensor depends on the point @xmath10 : which belongs to the matrix or to the inclusion .",
    "we assume that the averaged strain @xmath11 is prescribed , and decompose @xmath12 in two parts : @xmath13 , which is equivalent to representing @xmath14 , for @xmath15 being periodic on the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the mechanical problem which has to be solved reads @xmath16 the solution of ( [ pb1 ] ) is the tensor field @xmath6 , taking its average one can obtain the homogenized stiffness tensor @xmath17 from the equation @xmath18    to obtain all the components of @xmath17 in 3-dimensional space one needs to perform the computation of @xmath19 for six independent deformations @xmath20 , which morally correspond to usual stretch and shear tests . in order to solve the problem ( [ pb1 ] ) : one can employ the finite elements method , or discretize ( basically voxelize ) the rve to use the fft - based homogenization scheme  @xcite .",
    "our choice has gone to the last one . in the case of a homogeneous isotropic material ,",
    "the equations of ( [ pb1 ] ) have in the fourier space a green operator and basically produce an exact solution .",
    "the computation leads to an iterative procedure described and summerised in  @xcite.once the above algorithm has converged , we compute @xmath19 which has to be inserted into the equation ( [ average ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the mean - field homogenization models investigated in this work .",
    "a detailed description can be found in the references mentioned in the texts .",
    "the main idea of homogenization models is to find a globally homogeneous medium equivalent to the original composite .",
    "we restrict the composite to the matrix - inclusion type with perfect interfacial bonds between inclusions and their immediate surrounding matrix . because the local frame of reference @xmath21 attached to the inclusions main axes are not always identical to the global one @xmath22 attached to rve coordinate system , subscripts @xmath21 and `` @xmath22 ''",
    "are added , for the sake of clarity , to each tensor to indicate the coordinate system in which it is expressed .",
    "one can note that the subscripts `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' are not necessary when the inclusions are spherical or all aligned , because in this case @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the same . for randomly oriented inclusions reinforced composites , the geometrical orientation of each inclusion",
    "is described by three euler angles @xmath23 .",
    "the transition between the local coordinate system @xmath21 of the inclusion and the rve system @xmath22 is made by these three euler angles in the bunge convention  @xcite where the transformation matrix is given by @xmath24 defined as follows .",

    "the strain - localization tensor @xmath31 in this relation differs from one model to another .",
    "the next sections present the expression of the strain- localization tensor of the mean - field models studied in this paper .",
    "the self - consistent model ( sc ) assumes that each inclusion is embedded in a fictitious homogeneous matrix possessing the composite s unknown stiffness @xmath27 .",
    "generally , the model gives good predictions for polycrystals but is less accurate in the case of certain composites .",

    "it was shown by li  @xcite that all micromechanical approaches should provide a diagonally symmetric stiffness tensor , give identical thermal and mechanics stress tensors using two equivalent methods , satisfy the internal - consistency relationships between the effective moduli , and exhibit the correct behaviors at dilute and unitary concentration limits .",
    "unfortunately , the application of traditional scale transition models such as self - consistent models or mori - tanaka to the case of multi - phase materials containing heterogeneities of different shapes does not simultaneously satisfy all these five fundamental criteria .",

    "fig : results7 ] , [ fig : results8 ] and [ fig : results9 ] show the evolution of the normalized effective bulk , shear and young s moduli as function of the young s modulus contrast for the 6 rves investigated . in this study",
    ", we extended our computations to the cases when the inclusions are much stiffer .",
    "so , the young s modulus contrast varies from 1 to 400 .",
    "note that the rve@xmath77 of the previous section and the one containing 30% of ellipsoidal inclusions in this section have the same volume fraction of inclusions and the ellipsoids exhibited the same aspect ratio .",
    "the difference between these latter is the geometrical orientation of the inclusions . in others words ,",
    "the orientation factors of the two rves are not the same .",
    "this explains the slight difference between the results showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : results4 ] for rve@xmath77 and those obtained for the rve containing 30% of ellipsoids in figs .",

    "one can notice that lielensmodel is the most accurate when predicting all the effective properties .",
    "the mean - field analytical models are more sensitive to the ellipsoidal inclusions volume fraction .",
    "when the volume fraction of the inclusions increases , the prediction of the analytical models becomes less accurate . up to about 20% of inclusions ,",
    "both lielens and mori - tanaka models deliver accurate estimates of the homogenized properties whatever the contrast .",
    "however , the models are more accurate when predicting the effective bulk modulus than the prediction of the other effective properties . from a volume fraction of 30% of inclusions ,",
    "the models deliver accurate estimates only for low contrasts : up to 200 for lielens model when predicting the normalized effective bulk modulus ( @xmath80 = -9.4% ) and up to only 60 for the prediction of the normalized effective shear ( @xmath81 = -9.1% ) and young s ( @xmath75 = -11.5% ) moduli .",

    "the influence of the inclusions morphology on the estimation and the discrepancy between some classical mean - field approximation methods and a full - field computational method based on numerical homogenization techniques to predict the mechanical properties of these materials were investigated in this paper . several representative volume elements containing spherical , ellipsoidal inclusions and",
    "a mixture of both were studied . for low volume fractions of inclusions ,",
    "the results of the mean - field approximations and those of the fast fourier transform - based ( fftb ) full - field computation are very close , whatever the inclusions morphologys are . in this case",
    ", both lielens and mori - tanaka models can be a good alternative to the fftb homogenization methods . for rves consisting of spherical , ellipsoidal or a mixture of ellipsoidal and spherical inclusions",
    ", when the inclusions volume fraction becomes higher , one observes that lielens model and the fftb full - field computation give almost similar estimates .",
    "the accuracy of the computational methods depends also on the shape of the inclusions and their volume fraction .",
    "the contrasts between the fibers and the matrix remain the most influent parameters on the homogenization models accuracy.the ellipsoids aspect ratio has also some influence on the estimates and the discrepancies between models but this one is lesser than the influence of the volume fraction and the contrast . for microstructures with a mixture of ellipsoidal and spherical inclusions , lielens and mori - tanaka models could be a good alternative to the fftb model when the total inclusions volume fraction is about 12% . in this case , the normalized self - consistent model could also be an alternative to the fftb model with an error less than 5% .",
    "the normalized self - consistent model is less reliable for matrix - based composite when the inclusion volume fraction is high .",
    "although the full - field computation based on fft are more sensitive to the contrast rather than mean - field computation , the homogenization procedure based on the resolution of the lippmann - schwinger equation with fft gives a fast , reliable and an efficient way to determine the effective mechanical properties of composites reinforced with ellipsoidal and spherical particles due to less computational time consumption compare with mean - field homogenization computation .",
