    "over the past few years the idea of integrating the concepts of spintronics and molecular electronics has developed into a new research field dubbed _",
    "molecular spintronics_.@xcite progress has not only been stimulated by technological interests but has also been accompanied by the realization that magnetic single - molecule transistors exhibit various fundamental quantum phenomena.@xcite among many promising ideas discussed in the literature , particular attention has been paid to current - induced spin reading and writing , spin relaxation , entanglement , quantum computation , and kondo correlations .    an experimental realization of spintronics devices may be achieved by using single - molecule magnets in combination with metallic ( nonmagnetic or ferromagnetic ) leads . for molecular - memory applications ,",
    "long spin - relaxation times are advantageous , which may be realized in molecules with large magnetic anisotropy , such as molecules based on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2.@xcite    controlling and detecting the molecular spin by means of electronic tunneling into source and drain electrodes poses a major challenge .",
    "while some approaches rely on break junctions , others are based on a scanning tunneling microscope . in both cases ,",
    "the coupling between the molecule and the leads can vary by several orders of magnitude , thus giving rise to strikingly different transport regimes .    in the regime of weak molecule - lead coupling , many experimental features such as coulomb blockade",
    ", spin blockade , sequential tunneling , and cotunneling can be described within a master - equation or rate - equation approach treating the electronic tunneling perturbatively.@xcite however , for strong coupling , low - order perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "it is then advantageous to treat the electronic tunneling exactly , at the price of introducing approximations elsewhere .",
    "recently , the kondo effect in single - molecule magnets with easy - axis anisotropy has been studied by romeike _ _ et al.__@xcite their model describes an anisotropic spin coupled to metallic electrodes by an exchange interaction , in the absence of a bias voltage .",
    "this differs from the model studied here , in which the electronic spin in the relevant molecular orbital is coupled to an additional local , anisotropic spin via an exchange interaction @xmath3 , i.e. , charge fluctuations are explicitly taken into account .",
    "in addition , we include a nonzero bias voltage .",
    "the presence of a kondo effect for an anisotropic spin is at first glance surprising since it requires two approximately degenerate low - energy spin states connected by a term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian for an anisotropic spin @xmath4 with @xmath5 exchange - coupled to an electronic spin @xmath6 @xmath7 does not provide such a term . using a renormalization - group approach , romeike _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite could show that quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment , which is described by higher - order anisotropy terms not included in eq .",
    "( [ basich ] ) , may give rise to a kondo peak in the linear conductance , centered at zero bias voltage .",
    "the kondo temperature is found to depend strongly on the ratio of the applied magnetic field and the anisotropy barrier .",
    "further , gonzlez  _ _ et al.__@xcite have derived a kondo hamiltonian of the type studied in ref .   from an electronic model",
    "they have shown that a transverse magnetic field can induce or quench the kondo effect .",
    "this is due to berry - phase interference between different quantum tunneling paths of the spin .",
    "koerting _ _ et al.__@xcite consider the nonequilibrium kondo effect for a double quantum dot with four leads . by removing the leads coupled to one of the dots one would obtain a model similar to ours .",
    "the main difference is that we include charge fluctuations on the dot which is coupled to the leads , whereas koerting _ _ et al.__@xcite work in the regime of weak tunneling and coulomb blockade , where both quantum dots act as local spins .    in the present paper",
    ", we address the question of spin - dependent resonant tunneling and kondo tunneling through molecular magnets .",
    "as noted above , we consider a resonant - tunneling model where the electron spin on the quantum dot or molecule is coupled to an additional local , anisotropic spin via an exchange interaction @xmath3 .",
    "we assume this interaction to be weak , which allows us to employ perturbation theory for small @xmath3 .",
    "the stationary current through the left and right leads is identical and is related to the local electronic spectral function @xmath8 on the molecule by the meir - wingreen formula@xcite @xmath9    \\ , a_{\\sigma}(\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the spin , @xmath11 is the broadening of the molecular level due to the hybridization with lead @xmath12 , to be defined below , and @xmath13 denotes the fermi distribution function of lead @xmath14 .",
    "the spectral function is determined by the imaginary part of the retarded green s function , @xmath15 .",
    "if transport is dominated by a single molecular level of energy @xmath16 , the coupling to the leads gives rise to a lorentzian form of the spectral function , @xmath17 $ ] with @xmath18 , which manifests itself as a peak in the differential conductance .",
    "for single - molecule devices , the excitation of additional degrees of freedom due to the electronic tunneling is expected to translate into additional characteristic features in the current .",
    "we consider two complementary situations .",
    "the first is the case of arbitrary gate and bias voltages but excluding the region where the kondo contribution to the current is large . within a master - equation approach treating the local exchange interaction",
    "perturbatively to second order , we calculate the transition rates between local - spin states , showing that the spin can be driven out of equilibrium even for strong molecule - lead hybridization .",
    "signatures of inelastic tunneling such as the fine - structure splitting of the differential - conductance peaks persist in the regime where the hybridization energy exceeds the thermal energy .",
    "the second case concerns the regime of a large kondo contribution to the differential conductance , which only occurs for small bias voltages on the order of @xmath19 , as we shall see . here",
    ", transport is studied using a diagrammatic approach .",
    "we consider the case that the molecular orbital is far from resonance so that the resonant - tunneling contributions are negligible .",
    "in addition , this allows us to obtain analytical expressions .",
    "we find that the magnetic anisotropy gives rise to the appearance of two kondo peaks in the differential conductance at finite bias voltages @xmath20 .",
    "this intrinsically nonequilibrium kondo effect is quite different from the zero - bias peak studied by romeike _",
    "et al._,@xcite which relies on higher - order anisotropies absent from our model . in our case ,",
    "the magnetic anisotropy acts like a magnetic field in that it gives rise to a splitting of the kondo peak .",
