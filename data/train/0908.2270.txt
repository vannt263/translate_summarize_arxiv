    "studies of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes over the last few decades have revealed an intriguing variety of physical phenomena such as vacuum polarization , particle production etc . , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews . in particular , the discovery of hawking radiation by black holes has led to deep and fundamental issues , which have played an important role in attempts to formulate a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however , much of this discussion is rooted in the study of free field theories in curved spacetimes .",
    "the details , and even what one might call the basic physical processes , are much less clear when the field theory interacts strongly . gaining some insight into the strong coupling case will be the primary focus of the current work .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the situation for free fields on a fixed black hole spacetime .",
    "as is well known , the black hole radiates and absorbs field theory quanta in a manner much like an ideal black body at the hawking temperature @xmath1 , with absorption and emission coefficients modulated slightly by grey - body factors which depend on the details of the black hole geometry @xcite .",
    "several states for the field theory are commonly discussed .",
    "in particular , the so - called hartle - hawking vacuum describes radiation in equilibrium with the black hole , so that the ingoing and outgoing fluxes are balanced .",
    "the renormalized stress tensor in this state is regular on both future and past horizons , and the state is conveniently defined by a euclidean path integral periodic in imaginary time .",
    "however , one can also consider the time - asymmetric unruh vacuum which describes only the outgoing flux of hawking quanta from the black hole , or one may directly study the radiation emanating from a black hole formed in a gravitational collapse process .",
    "this radiation rapidly approaches precisely what one would expect from the above grey - body description at temperature @xmath1 @xcite . in any of the above settings , it is straightforward to compute occupation numbers and the expected stress tensor far from the black hole , though",
    "this becomes more difficult close to the horizon .",
    "if we now allow the field theory quanta to interact weakly , one expects this basic picture to hold at least in perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast , for strongly interacting theories it is a challenge to obtain even a qualitative understanding of hawking radiation .",
    "one can still formally define the hartle - hawking state via a euclidean path integral and , due to periodicity in euclidean time , it will satisfy the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition . in this sense",
    "the state is thermal ; see e.g. @xcite for reviews and references .",
    "in addition , since this construction reduces to the thermal path integral in flat space in the region far from the black hole , the stress tensor in this region will again be thermal . however , more detailed information is sorely lacking .",
    "in particular one has little knowledge of the corresponding unruh states or other out - of - equilibrium situations .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for further comments .",
    "one tool that can be used to probe field theories at strong coupling is the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "this correspondence maps the dynamics of the field theory to string theory ( or classical gravity ) in a higher dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "the field theories in question are typically non - abelian gauge theories ; denoting the rank of the gauge group by @xmath0 and the t hooft coupling by @xmath2 , in the limit of large rank and strong t hooft coupling ( @xmath3 ) the dual description of the field theory reduces to classical gravitational dynamics in the higher dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "super yang - mills dual to ads@xmath4 , the t hooft coupling @xmath2 controls the curvature radius of the ads spacetime in string units , while the string interactions are governed by @xmath5 .",
    "classical gravity is a good description when string interactions are suppressed and the curvatures are small .",
    "more generally , the field theory degrees of freedom are measured by a central charge @xmath6 and for the field theories with known holographic duals @xmath7 for some @xmath8 . ] following standard convention , we refer to ads / cft as a holographic duality due to this difference in dimensions and refer to the field theory as living on the conformal boundary of ads",
    ".    we should be clear that unruh - like and other out - of - equlibrium states remain challenging to describe even in the context of ads / cft and may require significant numerical work . in this paper , we restrict explicit constructions to configurations which , at least in the large @xmath0 , strong coupling limit , describe equilibrium states .",
    "these states are hartle - hawking - like in the sense that there is no net transport of heat in this limit .",
    "because hartle - hawking states do not exist for rotating asymptotically flat black holes @xcite , we focus on non - rotating black holes below .",
    "the rotating case will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . however , as the reader will see , the dual ads description of these hartle - hawking - like states strongly suggests that novel behaviors arise for nearby out - of - equilibrium states .",
    "interestingly , as we review in , studies of strongly coupled hawking radiation performed to date via ads / cft suggest that the effects of hawking radiation may be _ parametrically _ smaller as a function of @xmath0 at strong coupling than in free theories with the same field content . naively one would expect the energy density of hawking radiation to scale with some positive power of @xmath0 , since the black hole can radiate any of the microscopic field theory degrees of freedom with equal probability . however , an explicit analysis using the bulk gravitational description reveals an @xmath9 energy density .",
    "this conclusion is arrived at by studying known black hole solutions in ads spacetimes which asymptote to the given black hole metric on the boundary of ads , as this is the black hole background on which the field theory lives @xcite .",
    "a partial explanation of this feature was offered in @xcite , which noted that the field theories under study exhibit confined phases gauge theories which do not exhibit a dynamical mass gap ( unlike qcd ) . the notion of confinement versus",
    "deconfinement is simply the statement about the free energy ; it is @xmath9 in the confined and @xmath10 in the deconfined phases . ]",
    "where , even at large @xmath0 , the density of propagating modes remains only @xmath11 and does not grow with @xmath0 .",
    "in such a phase , hawking radiation far from the black hole would be correspondingly reduced .",
    "however , the field theories also exhibit deconfined phases , where the density of propagating modes is much larger ( of @xmath12 for some @xmath13 ) .",
    "furthermore , at high temperatures the confined phase is thermodynamically unstable or , at best , meta - stable and decays to the deconfined phase .",
    "it therefore remains to understand hawking radiation in the deconfined phase , as well as transitions between the two phases in the presence of black holes .",
    "for example , to what extent does a hot black hole tend to  melt \" the confined phase and to catalyze a transition to a deconfined phase ? these are the questions we begin to explore below .",
    "the previous literature on this subject has largely focussed on the case where the large @xmath0 field theory is coupled to dynamical gravity .",
    "this situation is holographically dual @xcite to randall - sundrum braneworld models @xcite , and much of the interest centered on possible implications for brane - world phenomenology .",
    "in particular , it was argued in @xcite that considerations of hawking radiation in the large @xmath0 theory implied that black holes in such a brane - world setting would rapidly disappear from the brane .",
    "the point here was that , if free field theory could be used as a guide , the timescale for black hole evaporation would be a certain function of @xmath0 and the black hole mass ( @xmath14 ) times the effective newton constant ( @xmath15 ) on the brane , @xmath16 , which , under the holographic duality , maps to a classical timescale in the bulk gravitational description .",
    "as a result , even at the purely classical level in the bulk , refs .",
    "@xcite argued that there should be no static black hole solutions in these braneworld scenarios .",
    "while the above argument was later countered by the observation of @xcite that the large @xmath0 theory might be in a confined phase , many issues remain open ; see e.g. @xcite for summaries and recent progress .",
    "although the braneworld questions continue to be of interest , we find it useful at both the conceptual and practical level to focus on the limit in which gravity on the brane decouples and the field theory propagates on a fixed non - dynamical black hole background . from the bulk perspective , this is the limit where the brane recedes to the ads boundary and the metric on the brane becomes simply a boundary condition that one imposes by hand .",
    "we focus on this limiting case throughout most of this work , though we mention implications for dynamical braneworld black holes in .",
    "we begin by using ads / cft to give a heuristic picture of hawking radiation for strongly coupled large @xmath0 field theories in , where we also review the relevant known results . in a deconfined phase",
    ", we argue that two possible behaviors may result , depending on the size @xmath17 and the hawking temperature @xmath1 of the black hole in relation to various scales in the field theory .",
    "note that since our field theory lives on a fixed background spacetime in which gravity is non - dynamical , we are free to consider arbitrary black hole geometries which need not satisfy any equations of motion . as a result , we may regard @xmath17 and @xmath1 as completely independent quantities . in terms of more familiar examples",
    ", one may think of reisner - nordstrom black holes where one may adjust the relative size of @xmath17 and @xmath1 by changing the charge .",
    "we refer to these arbitrarily specified black holes as either _ field theory black holes _ or _ boundary black holes _ to distinguish them from _ bulk _ black holes that arise in the dual ads description ; the latter will satisfy einstein s equation with a cosmological constant as well as a boundary condition determined by the field theory black hole metric .    at given @xmath1",
    ", we will argue that large asymptotically flat field theory black holes couple strongly to the deconfined plasma .",
    "here we use the term coupling in a loose sense that characterizes how excitations around the hartle - hawking state interact with the ( non - dynamical ) black hole .",
    "strong coupling means that deviations from the hartle - hawking state relax back to equilibrium on a timescale set by the black hole size , while weak coupling means that such deviations decay much more slowly .",
    "consider first strongly coupled large field theory black holes as defined above .",
    "for these the bulk ads duals of the corresponding hartle - hawking states will be novel spacetimes having a single connected horizon which we dub _ black funnels _",
    "( see a ) . in this case , performing work on the system or introducing additional heat sources or sinks will result in heat exchange with the field theory black hole at a rate typical of heat flow through deconfined plasma . in the bulk , this heat will simply flow along the horizon from the boundary black hole down the throat of the funnel and out along the shoulders .",
    "in contrast , we argue that the hartle - hawking states of smaller asymptotically flat black holes will be dual to bulk ads solutions containing two disconnected horizons .",
    "one bulk horizon reaches the ads boundary , where it ends on the horizon of the boundary black hole .",
    "we refer to this bulk horizon as a _ black droplet _ , as we expect this horizon to cap off smoothly in the bulk ( see b ) . the other horizon will asymptotically approach that of a planar black hole , in which case this bulk horizon approaches that of the black holes discussed in @xcite . ] . in a slight abuse of language",
    ", it will be convenient to overlook this distortion and continue to refer to this horizon as a planar black hole .     and horizon size @xmath17",
    "( the top line corresponds to the boundary , the dots denote the horizon of the boundary black hole ) .",
    "here we fix @xmath1 and vary @xmath17 ; ( a ) for sufficiently large @xmath17 , we expect the bulk solution to have a single connected horizon in a  funnel \" shape , while ( b ) for small @xmath17 , we expect two disconnected horizons , a  droplet \" and a planar black hole .",
    "the shaded regions are those inside the bulk horizons . ]",
    "the lack of connection between the two bulk horizons for small boundary black holes suggests that performing work on the system or introducing additional heat sources or sinks results in rather little heat exchange between the two bulk black holes , and thus rather little exchange between the field theory black hole and the field theory plasma . as a result",
    ", the amount of heat and other quantities transported outward from the field theory black hole will be similar to what one would expect in a confined phase , even if @xmath1 is far above the temperature @xmath18 of any deconfinement transition . from the field theory point of view",
    ", we interpret the weak coupling between the black hole and plasma as being due to the finite ( and large ) physical size @xmath19 of plasma excitations relative to the black hole , @xmath20 .",
    "following this heuristic discussion , we construct examples of black funnels in low spacetime dimensions for various classes of boundary black holes .",
    "in we consider asymptotically flat 1 + 1 field theory black holes . as we discuss below , all 1 + 1 black holes",
    "should be thought of as having a large size @xmath17 in comparison with any other scale . as a result",
    ", only black funnel solutions will be expected from the arguments of and this is indeed what we find .",
    "we then turn to higher dimensional examples ; considers 2 + 1 black holes on the boundary of asymptotically spacetimes exploiting the known ads c - metric solutions . here",
    "our particular method of constructing the solution generates 2 + 1 boundary black holes which are asymptotic to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ( riemannian - signature ) hyperbolic plane . in this context",
    "we find both black funnels and black droplets suspended above disconnected horizons .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion of the implications for braneworld black holes in .",
    "as described in the introduction , we wish to investigate strongly interacting quantum fields in a black hole spacetime . to this end",
    "we will employ the ads / cft correspondence in the planar limit .",
    "thus , at least for the moment , we restrict attention to field theories for which this correspondence applies . our goal , however , is to extract certain general lessons which we hope will be applicable to a much wider set of models .",
    "the essence of the ads / cft correspondence is that the strongly coupled field theory dynamics is recorded in terms of string theory ( or classical gravity if the field theory admits an appropriate planar limit ) with appropriate asymptotically anti - de sitter boundary conditions .",
    "if the bulk ads spacetime geometry is some negatively curved @xmath23-dimensional lorentzian manifold , @xmath24 , with conformal boundary @xmath25 , then the field theory lives on a spacetime @xmath26 of dimension @xmath27 in the same conformal class as @xmath25 . choosing an appropriate conformal frame , one may identify @xmath26 and @xmath25 and speak of the field theory as living on the ads boundary . from the standpoint of the bulk theory",
    ", the choice of metric on @xmath26 fixes a boundary condition that the bulk solution must satisfy .. ] the correspondence is simplest to state for conformal field theories in dimensions where the trace anomaly vanishes , but with appropriate care the correspondence also holds in the presence of a trace anomaly and it can accommodate non - conformal deformations",
    ".    given this set - up we can probe the details of hawking radiation in the strongly coupled field theory .",
    "more interestingly , as described in , if the field theory under consideration exhibits non - trivial phase structure we should be able to ascertain the holographic duals of each distinct phase . to consider field theory in a black hole background , we merely choose @xmath26 to be a black hole spacetime .",
    "the space of field theory states on @xmath26 then corresponds to the space of asymptotically ads states of string theory subject to the boundary condition above . in the planar limit of the field theory ,",
    "the latter is essentially the solution space of classical ( super-)gravity with the given boundary condition .",
    "the different phases of the cft on @xmath26 should thus correspond to different bulk spacetime geometries @xmath24 in this solution space .",
    "we work in a universal sector of the ads / cft correspondence , wherein the bulk spacetime @xmath24 is a solution to einstein s equations with a negative cosmological constant . the bulk action is therefore taken to be to denote the bulk metric on @xmath24 with uppercase latin indices indicating the bulk spacetime dimensions .",
    "the metric on @xmath26 will be denoted as @xmath28 with lowercase greek indices labeling boundary directions . ]",
    "@xmath29 where we can express the cosmological constant as @xmath30 in terms of the ads@xmath31 radius @xmath32 . from the field theory side we concentrate on the response of the energy - momentum tensor to the non - trivial background on @xmath26 .",
    "let us consider the simple case where the boundary spacetime @xmath26 has a killing field @xmath33 which generates the black hole horizon and which is timelike in some asymptotic region far from the black hole . for simplicity",
    "we also take the black hole horizon in @xmath26 to have a single connected component , although this is not imposed on us by any equations of motion .",
    "field theory states that are stationary with respect to @xmath33 are dual to bulk solutions with a killing field @xmath34 which agrees with @xmath33 on the boundary",
    ". we will focus on equilibrium states so that , as with the hartle - hawking vacuum , the field theory stress tensor should be regular on both future and past horizons . as a result",
    ", the bulk spacetime should also have a regular killing horizon .",
    "the problem at hand thus reduces to finding distinct black hole solutions for a gravitational theory in @xmath35 spacetime dimensions , all of which obey the prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "the phase structure of the cft on @xmath26 is just the classical phase structure of the corresponding black hole spacetimes .    after a brief review of deconfinement transitions in ads / cft in ,",
    "we give a heuristic discussion of the desired bulk black hole spacetimes in below .",
    "the main conclusion is that bulk solutions dual to field theory black holes in equilibrium with a deconfined plasma may display two possible behaviors .",
    "the bulk killing horizon may be connected , a case we refer to as a black funnel , or it may be disconnected .",
    "which possibility is realized is determined by the size @xmath17 and the temperature @xmath1 of the boundary black hole in comparison with certain scales set by the field theory .",
    "a sharp phase transition is expected as one tunes the values of @xmath36 though the critical values .",
    "and @xmath1 involves changing the metric on the boundary manifold @xmath26 .",
    "we will treat the background spacetime as an external parameter for the field theory and describe the different possibilities as distinct phases of the field theory . ] in we interpret our conclusions in field theory language : in the connected case the black hole couples strongly to the deconfined plasma while there is no such coupling in the disconnected case . in this latter situation",
    "it appears that this coupling is prohibited by the intrinsic size of the field theory excitations which have condensed to form the plasma .",
    "this discussion sets the stage for the rest of the paper , which focusses on constructing such solutions .",
    "it is useful to begin by reviewing the ads / cft description of the confinement / deconfinement transition ; we will first discuss the case where there is no black hole on the boundary .",
    "moreover , we take @xmath26 to have compact spatial sections where there is a sharp transition in the planar ( large @xmath0 ) limit . for instance , one can consider a cft on the einstein static universe , i.e. , @xmath37 , which is the boundary of the global ads spacetime . as a prototype example , the reader can keep in mind the phase structure of the four dimensional @xmath38 super - yang mills ( sym ) in @xmath39 , but the discussion extends analogously to other dimensions .    at low temperature",
    "we have the confined phase with @xmath9 free energy and at high temperatures a deconfined phase with @xmath40 free energy , where @xmath6 is the central charge can be defined either from the two point function of the energy momentum tensor , or by looking at the entropy density of a cft at finite temperature , which from dimensional analysis scales as @xmath41 .",
    "] of the cft which we take to scale as @xmath7 . in the case of @xmath38 sym , @xmath42 , reflecting the non - abelian gluon degrees of freedom . in the holographic dual",
    "this transition is the hawking - page transition @xcite where the thermal geometry exchanges dominance with the spacetime @xcite .",
    "gauge theories on compact spatial manifolds @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for analogous results for three dimensional chern - simons matter theories . ]",
    "the phase transition occurs at the deconfinement temperature @xmath18 which is set by the curvature radius of the @xmath43 ( which is the only other dimensionful parameter in the problem if we consider conformal field theories ) .",
    "one can also consider the situation where the boundary is just a minkowski space , @xmath44 , which is of greater relevance to our immediate considerations . in this case",
    "there is nt a phase transition since the only scale in the problem is the temperature .",
    "as we will describe below , at any non - zero temperature the field theory always prefers to live in the deconfined phase .",
    "formally , however , one can consider the two distinct phases and their dual geometries to gain intuition for the physics of the field theories .",
    "the relevant bulk solutions are i ) pure spacetime expressed in a conformal frame such that the boundary metric just the flat minkowski metric , e.g. , @xmath45 which is dual to the confined phase , and ii ) the planar black hole , @xmath46 dual to the deconfined phase . here and below we use @xmath47 to denote coordinates along the boundary at @xmath48 . in this sense , @xmath49 is a radial coordinate in ads .",
    "in addition we have @xmath50 so that the horizon is located at @xmath51 and has temperature @xmath52 .",
    "the stress tensor of the large @xmath0 field theory is given by the boundary stress tensor ( aka `` holographic stress tensor '' ) of the bulk solution @xcite , which is readily computed ( following , say , @xcite ) from the fefferman - graham expansion @xcite",
    "; i.e. , by expanding the metric in powers of @xmath49 in the above coordinates .",
    "one finds ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath53 in particular , we should note that the correspondence relates the central charge of the field theory to the ads radius measured in planck units , i.e. , @xmath54 , providing the desired mapping between the field theory and the gravitational parameters . in the case of @xmath38 sym in four dimensions we have @xmath55 .",
    "the planar black hole corresponds to a field theory state with stress energy of order @xmath6 , consistent with the interpretation as a deconfined phase .    comparing the free energies of the corresponding euclidean spacetimes",
    ", one finds that the planar black hole has lower free energy for any @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath56 the confined phase is thermodynamically unstable .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the horizon of ( [ planarads ] ) is degenerate . as a result , while the thermal circle in the euclidean solution shrinks to zero size near the horizon , it remains non - contractible .",
    "this means that strings wrapped on the thermal circle have a tachyon near the horizon @xcite , rendering the phase unstable .",
    "in contrast , the planar black hole is thermodynamically stable .",
    "it is an interesting fact that , for the only known asymptotically locally ads solutions with asymptotically flat boundary black holes , the boundary stress tensor vanishes far from the black hole @xcite .",
    "these solutions are essentially the schwarzschild black string solution of @xcite up to minor modifications",
    ". numerical investigations to date @xcite also suggest solutions of this sort ; see however @xcite . as a result",
    ", these solutions appear to represent a confined phase of the dual field theory in the black hole background .",
    "in contrast , we wish to study hartle - hawking - like states of the field theory on black hole spacetimes . for concreteness",
    ", we suppose that @xmath26 is asymptotically flat and contains a single connected horizon .",
    "other cases where @xmath33 becomes asymptotically constant are similar , though the ads - like case where the norm grows asymtotically is more subtle and will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . as noted in , for the asymptotically flat case",
    "the euclidean path integral tells us that @xmath57 should approach the stress tensor of a thermal fluid in the asymptotic region . as a result",
    ", the bulk dual should approach the planar ads black hole ( [ planarbh ] ) at large @xmath58 , with a corresponding horizon localized near @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , in any region near the boundary ( @xmath48 ) , there must be a horizon , whose restriction to @xmath26 coincides with that of the boundary black hole .",
    "there are clearly two possibilities : either these two horizons join to form a single connected horizon , or they are disconnected , see .",
    "we now argue that which possibility occurs is primarily determined by the size @xmath17 of the boundary black hole and its temperature @xmath1 . in particular , we expect disconnected horizons for @xmath60 , but connected horizons for @xmath61 , though the precise value of @xmath62 at the transition may depend on the details of both the black hole geometry @xmath26 and the particular field theory in question .",
    "the basic argument is quite simple .",
    "consider the planar black hole ( [ planarbh ] ) at some temperature @xmath63 .",
    "this solution is stable to small perturbations .",
    "we now wish to perturb this solution by adding a black hole of the same temperature @xmath1 to the boundary metric .",
    "our general experience with ads spaces suggests that the effect of a disturbance of size @xmath17 on the boundary falls off deep in the bulk and typically extends to @xmath64 .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in perturbative studies for some gauge invariant operator on the boundary . in the bulk",
    "this source will produce a field @xmath65 which can be determined using the bulk to boundary propagator @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation of convolving the gaussian waveform with the bulk to boundary propagator reveals that the bulk field penetrates down to @xmath64 . ] or , in perhaps a closer parallel to black hole horizons , studies of minimal surfaces which intersect the boundary in spheres of size @xmath17 , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "thus , since the planar black hole horizon is at @xmath66 , the effect on this horizon of adding the black hole to the boundary should be perturbative for @xmath67 . in this case",
    "we expect to find a static bulk solution with two disconnected horizons : one horizon will be a perturbed planar black hole , while the other should hang down into the bulk from the boundary black hole , with the horizon capping off smoothly far above the ( perturbed ) planar horizon .",
    "we refer to the first horizon as simply the planar black hole , while the second horizon we christen a _ black droplet .",
    "_ see b for a sketch of the solution .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath68 the horizon of the planar black hole will be strongly perturbed .",
    "if one imagined a two - horizon solution containing a black droplet and a separate planar black hole , the horizons would nearly touch .",
    "it is natural to assume that the horizons merge , resulting in a single connected horizon which we call a _ black funnel_. it is an interesting question whether black funnels also exist for @xmath69 and , if so , how their free energies compare to the corresponding two horizon ( droplet + planar black hole ) solution .",
    "we note that the above argument can be generalized in several ways .",
    "one could consider non - equilibrium solutions in which the horizons have different temperatures .",
    "so long as the horizons remain disconnected , this need not be a problem in classical gravity ; i.e.  in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "our argument suggests that only the size @xmath17 of the boundary black hole and the temperature @xmath70 of the planar black hole are relevant , and that the horizons should again remain disconnected for @xmath71 , and in particular in the limit @xmath72 , in which the planar black hole horizon becomes just the poincar horizon of planar ads .",
    "for @xmath73 we again expect the horizons to join .",
    "however , from the field theory viewpoint , any stationary non - equilibrium situation must have a constant flow of heat .",
    "such terms in the boundary stress tensor necessarily diverge on either the past or the future horizon , as is familiar from unruh states .",
    "thus , only in equilibrium states can the stress tensor be regular on both horizons . as a result , a bulk black funnel with a smooth bifurcate killing horizon should exist only when the temperature @xmath1 of the boundary black hole satisfies @xmath74 .",
    "the above discussion raises many interesting questions concerning both non - equilibrium black holes and the detailed phase diagram of equilibrium ads black holes when the boundary metric @xmath26 is a black hole spacetime .",
    "however , since these issues are a departure from our main focus , we save such discussion for .",
    "it is natural to ask what each class of ads solutions suggested above would imply for the dual quantum field theory .",
    "the black funnels are easy to interpret . on the field theory side ,",
    "they represent black holes in equilibrium with a deconfined plasma with which they interact strongly .",
    "in particular , the bulk horizon will conduct heat , charge , etc to the boundary black hole at a rate determined by an appropriate ( positive ) power of @xmath0 . from the field theory perspective",
    ", the state resembles a large-@xmath0 analogue of the free hartle - hawking state , with the energy density scaled up by an appropriate power of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , consider such a state at finite volume ( e.g. , on a torus ) . if the volume is either increased or decreased by a small amount , one expects heat to flow either out of or into the black hole so that the solution quickly settles down to a new hartle - hawking - like state at the same temperature .",
    "more dramatic non - equilibrium effects may also be possible and will be discussed in .",
    "in contrast , the two - horizon solutions present a greater surprise . they represent black holes in equilibrium with a deconfined plasma",
    "to which they are only very weakly coupled in the following sense : one notes that the plasma excitations , thought of as small deformations of the bulk planar black hole , can pass directly under the black droplet with minimal interaction .",
    "the two horizons can exchange heat only via the @xmath9 fields that propagate in the bulk .",
    "for example , suppose we have such a state for a field theory in finite volume and then either increase or decrease this volume by a small amount . at the classical level , the bulk ads solution clearly responds by increasing or decreasing the height of the planar black hole horizon ; i.e. , by heating or cooling the plasma so that its temperature @xmath75 no longer matches @xmath1 of the boundary black hole .",
    "it is only over very long time scales that quantum effects in the bulk ( which are suppressed by a factor of @xmath76 ) will return the plasma to the black hole temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this slow rate of heat exchange with the field theory black hole is more typical of what one would expect in a _ confined _ phase .",
    "the reader will note that such behavior is radically different from the hawking effect for free fields .",
    "we should thus give some explanation from the field theory perspective of how this weak coupling might arise .",
    "we believe that the answer is best understood by thinking of the plasma excitations as having a finite physical size @xmath19 , which happens to be rather larger than the size @xmath17 of the black hole",

    "this quotient is non - compact , but the metric shows that any region near @xmath202 has finite volume .",
    "now , conformal field theories on hyperbolic manifolds with finite volume are prone to instabilities , as conformally coupled scalars will pick up negative masses . in the gravity description the tunneling amplitude may be easily computed by looking for the nucleation probability of m2-branes @xcite . if were the full boundary metric , this would not be of concern as the field theory would live on a space of infinite volume even when @xmath209 has finite range , suppressing the rate for the scalars to tunnel out to infinity from a local minimum",
    ". however , a black hole horizon in cuts off this divergence , so that the field theory lives on a spacetime for which the volume outside the horizon is finite .",
    "we therefore expect our solutions to be unstable to bulk quantum processes ( boundary @xmath263 effects ) when the range of @xmath209 is compact",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if this feature is associated in an essential way with the properties of quadrant iv , and in particular with black droplets suspended above @xmath264 hyperbolic black holes .",
    "motivated by the desire to better understand hawking radiation in strongly coupled field theories , we have analyzed a dual formulation of the problem using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the field theory maps via this correspondence to the classical dynamics of einstein s equations in a bulk ads spacetime .",
    "given a field theory in a black hole background @xmath26 we are instructed to find all the negatively curved einstein manifolds @xmath24 whose boundary is @xmath26 .",
    "we have two distinct possible duals for the hartle - hawking state of the field theory in the boundary black hole background :    * the black funnel , which is a bulk solution with a single connected horizon . * a black droplet and a planar or hyperbolic ads black hole , i.e. , a solution with two disconnected horizons .",
    "a black hole spacetime @xmath26 typically has a horizon size @xmath17 and a temperature @xmath1 and , as we have argued in , general considerations indicate that at least for asymptotically flat boundary black holes the black funnel is preferred for @xmath61 while the multiple - horizon solution dominates for @xmath60 . in either case",
    "the bulk solution is dual to the deconfined phase of the field theory in the boundary black hole background , i.e. , the free energy and the quantum stress tensor of the field theory scales like the central charge @xmath6 of the cft . from the field theory point of view , which possibility occurs depends on the rate at which the field theory plasma equilibrates with the ( non - dynamical ) field theory black hole , a concept we refer to as the `` coupling '' of plasma excitations to the black hole in the sense that strong coupling means fast equilibration .",
    "we interpreted the weak coupling case as arising when the plasma excitations have a typical physical size @xmath19 which is greater than the size @xmath17 of the black hole .",
    "the size of such excitations is an analogue of the gravitational form factors discussed in @xcite .",
    "while pointlike particles display no sharp transition in the strength of their coupling to black holes , our arguments indicate a new kind of phase transition in the large @xmath0 , strong coupling ( @xmath265 ) limit . due to the change in connectivity of the bulk horizon",
    ", the on - shell action in the bulk will be non - analytic in parameters that control the size of the boundary black hole .",
    "this then implies that the partition function of the field theory in the boundary black hole background will exhibit non - analytic behavior characteristic of phase transitions .",
    "it would be very interesting to probe this transition , and in particular the regime @xmath266 which is relevant for the field theory in an asymptotically flat schwarzschild black hole background .",
    "it would be natural for this transition to be similar to the gregory - laflamme transition , and to display corresponding singular solutions with  pinched horizons \" connecting parts of the phase diagram with different topologies .",
    "we focussed here on constructing simple analytic examples of funnels and droplets in low dimensions .",
    "we showed that only funnels can arise for 1 + 1 boundary black holes , and constructed a corresponding solution in .",
    "we then explored the ads c - metric family of spacetimes in to find examples of funnels and droplets for 2 + 1 boundary black holes .",
    "both types of solutions were found , but only for boundary black holes that are asymptotic to @xmath267 .",
    "asymptotically flat boundary black holes simply do not arise in this family of spacetimes .",
    "also , due to the peculiarities of the c - metric family , the droplet solutions did not describe true equilibrium configurations .",
    "instead , the droplets were suspended above hyperbolic black holes of different temperatures @xmath135 .",

    "however , several factors make this difficult : i ) there is an extra scale from the curvature of the @xmath22 , ii ) our droplet solutions are not in equilibrium , and iii ) we have at hand only those solutions that belong to the c - metric family ; more general solutions will certainly exist . as a result , we content ourselves with the following observations :    * the only outer horizon whose temperature can be large is the @xmath212 horizon , which is a smooth horizon only in quadrants iii and iv of .",
    "high temperatures occur at large values of the parameter @xmath2 , for which quadrant iii contains a black funnel and quadrant iv contains a hyperbolic black hole which does not reach the boundary .",
    "the quadrant iv boundary metric has no horizon and contains no black hole .",
    "] thus , while we find high temperature black funnels , as predicted by there are no droplets suspended above high temperature hyperbolic black holes . *",
    "the only @xmath132 limit of a smooth outer horizon occurs for the @xmath225 horizon in quadrant ii for @xmath268 .",
    "this horizon is a black funnel , and not the droplet predicted by .",
    "this may be related to the @xmath22 curvature , which one expects to be relevant for small @xmath1 .",
    "it may also be that a droplet solution exists in some larger family of solutions , and that this droplet solution is thermodynamically preferred .",
    "* limits where the outer horizons horizons approach @xmath214 might be thought of as small black holes , i.e. , `` small r '' in the sense of , but this situation does nt arise within the ads c - metric family of solutions .",
    "* one might also wish to study `` large r '' limits .",
    "it might appear that @xmath142 provides such a limit , where the @xmath212 and @xmath225 horizons approach @xmath248 .",
    "however , we must take this limit holding the bulk ads scale @xmath174 fixed , so that @xmath269 and our metric degenerates .",
    "a @xmath142 scaling limit is described in .",
    "this limit yields boundary black holes of finite size , and bulk solutions corresponding to either black funnels or ( non - compact analogues of ) black droplets suspended above hyperbolic black holes .",
    "this time , however , the droplets and hyperbolic black holes are in equilibrium .",
    "the scaling limit takes an especially simple form ( [ adsclm1 m ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "while the ads c - metric family of solutions yields interesting examples of black funnels and droplets , these unfortunately do nt lend themselves to a detailed verification of the predictions of .    our work raises a number of interesting questions and suggests many directions for further research .",
    "these include exploring the above phase transition and a more thorough exploration of the space of solutions ( probably through numerical work ) in both 2 + 1 and higher dimensions . some particularly interesting further avenues for exploration are as follows :    * confining field theories , plasma balls , black funnels , and black droplets : * it is interesting to consider field theories with a first order deconfinement transition at some @xmath270 .",
    "these may be addressed using ads / cft @xcite by making a so - called scherk - schwarz compactification of the boundary field theory , for which @xmath26 asymptotes to @xmath271 with anti - periodic boundary conditions on any fermions along the @xmath272 .",
    "the presence of a new scale in the problem , viz .",
    ", the size of the @xmath272 ( call it @xmath273 ) ensures that one can have a proper phase transition as one varies the product @xmath274 .    when @xmath26 is precisely @xmath271 , the deconfined phase is again the planar black hole ( [ planarbh ] ) while the confined phase is the so - called ads soliton @xcite .",
    "the latter contains an  infra - red ( ir ) floor \" where the @xmath272 smoothly caps off at a finite value of the ads radial coordinate ( or the fefferman - graham coordinate @xmath49 ) without generating a horizon , so that the bulk spacetime looks like a cigar geometry .",
    "this situation leads to interesting new solutions with compact horizons localized near the ir floor @xcite .",
    "such solutions are called  plasma balls \" since they are dual to balls of deconfined plasma that nucleate from the confined state .",
    "they have a characteristic size which depends on how close the temperature is to the deconfinement temperature @xmath275 , and in fact their size diverges as the temperature approaches @xmath18 .",
    "we expect that similar solutions should arise when @xmath26 contains a black hole .",
    "in addition , this setting allows a simple smooth solution where the boundary metric is @xmath272 times any ricci - flat black hole ( e.g. , schwarzschild ) , where the bulk horizon is a string that extends from the ads boundary to the ir floor .",
    "this solution should probably be called the schwarzschild - black string ads soliton , but we will refer to it as the schwarzschild soliton string .",
    "one would like to explore the full phase diagram as one varies @xmath36 of the boundary black hole ( keeping the size of the circle @xmath273 fixed ) in order to understand how these schwarzschild soliton strings are connected to plasma balls , black funnels , black droplets , and so forth .",
    "one also wishes to understand which solutions are dynamically and/or thermodynamically stable .",
    "in particular , the schwarzschild soliton strings should be dynamically unstable for @xmath276 .",
    "one might expect that the instability leads to black droplets as originally conjectured by @xcite in the context of ads black strings , but the possibility of a rather more spectacular instability to black funnel formation has not been ruled out . indeed , even if this does not occur for schwarzschild soliton strings , it may occur for more general boundary metrics , providing contexts in which black holes in some sense `` melt '' confined phases dynamically and catalyze their transition to deconfined phases .",
    "* other field theory asymptotics : * it is also interesting to discuss the case studied in @xcite where the field theory itself lives in an asymptotically ads@xmath277 spacetime such as schwarzschild - ads@xmath277 or btz for @xmath278 . in such cases ,",
    "the bulk dual is an asymptotically ads@xmath279 spacetime whose boundary metric is asymptotically ads@xmath280 .",
    "this case appears to have additional subtleties ( owing to the norm of the timelike killing field growing on the boundary ) and will be discussed separately in a forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "* rotation : * rotating asymptotically flat field theory black holes do not admit well - defined hartle - hawking states @xcite due to features associated with super - radiance . from the bulk perspective",
    ", one expects that black funnels can not exist for rotating boundary black holes , since it is not possible for the funnels to be rigidy rotating . as a result , in this work we have focussed on non - rotating field theory black holes",
    "however , the rotating case will be explored in @xcite .",
    "* non - equilibrium solutions : * small disturbances of equilibrium solutions generally result in flows of heat .",
    "we suggested interesting examples in , based on placing black funnels , or droplets suspended above planar black holes , in finite volume . in the funnel case ,",
    "changing the volume should result in a large flow of heat along the horizon on short timescales .",
    "in the droplet / planar case , the planar horizon will respond rapidly to the change in volume by changing its temperature .",
    "it is only over very long timescales associated with hawking radiation in the bulk that it will re - equilibrate with the droplet , whose temperature is fixed to be @xmath1 by its connection to the boundary black hole .",
    "though we consider only deconfined phases , in this latter case the heat exchange with the black hole would be more typical of what one would expect in a confined phase of the field theory .",
    "the solutions from containing black droplets suspended above hyperbolic black holes with a different temperature provide some support for this picture .",
    "these solutions are static in the limit of a classical ads bulk , though they will feature a flow of heat when bulk quantum effects are included . it would be interesting to explore the space of such solutions more thoroughly , especially for asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "black funnel solutions displaying a constant flow of heat either into or out of the boundary black hole may also prove tractable , at least with numerical methods .",
    "one may be able to fix the temperature of the shoulder region of independently of the boundary black hole temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this is a stationary situation , in which one expects a stationary bulk ads solution .",
    "however , rather remarkably , the event horizon can not be a smooth killing horizon , as such horizons have uniform temperature .",
    "while stationary black holes without killing horizons are unfamiliar , there is no contradiction with the known rigidity theorems ( e.g.  @xcite ) which require a compactly generated horizon .",
    "furthermore , the constant flow of heat implies that the boundary stress tensor must diverge on the past horizon of the field theory black hole , suggesting that the bulk solution is also singular on the past horizon .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the considerations of the fluid - gravity correspondence @xcite where arbitrary fluid flows in the field theory were mapped to inhomogeneous , dynamical black holes in the bulk ads spacetime , albeit with a crucial distinction : since the fluid - gravity solutions are necessarily dynamical , no novel stationary solutions are known in that context .",
    "the possibility of such novel solutions raises many further questions about the relation between the boundary heat flow and the bulk horizon generators , compatibility with raychaudhuri s theorem , and the bulk description of the flows of negative energy across the horizon of the field theory black holes that one associates with hawking radiation in the field theory .",
    "after all , from the field theory perspective , it must be this hawking radiation that carries heat outward from the field theory black hole .",
    "* implications for braneworlds : * in this work we have concentrated on bulk solutions which extend to the ads boundary , where we can fix any metric as a boundary condition .",
    "however , one may imagine attempting to cut off such solutions with a so - called `` ultra - violet ( uv ) brane '' so that the solution instead ends on a dynamical boundary at finite distance .",
    "one expects this to be possible at least at the level of initial data , though because the uv brane is dynamical the resulting evolution may take a rather different form .",
    "nevertheless , it would be very interesting to understand the dynamics that result from cutting off any of the classes of solutions described above .",
    "one expects equilibrium solutions to remain static , but not necessarily stable .",
    "a primary question in this field remains the end - state of the instability associated with the ads black strings ( or equivalently the schwarzschild soliton strings from our discussion of confining theories ) .",
    "while one expects a decay to a stable droplet attached to the brane , an instability to the formation of a black funnel is not ruled out .",
