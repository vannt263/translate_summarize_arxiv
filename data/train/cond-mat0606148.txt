    "the effect of impurities on the transport properties of low - dimensional systems has attracted a great deal of attention during the last years . in a pioneer work ,",
    "kane and fisher showed that the transport of a one - channel luttinger liquid through a barrier is strikingly different from that in a fermi - liquid consisting of non - interacting electrons.@xcite using a renormalization group technique , they have shown that the behavior depends crucially on whether the electron - interactions are repulsive or attractive .",
    "for repulsive interactions , @xmath0 , the barrier is relevant , and arbitrary small ones lead to complete reflection at zero temperature . on the other hand , for attractive interactions , @xmath1 ,",
    "the barrier is an irrelevant perturbation and transmission is perfect through even the largest barriers .",
    "non - interacting electrons ( @xmath2 ) exhibit a behavior intermediate between these two limits because in this case the barrier is a marginal perturbation .",
    "later , the resonant tunneling of a single - channel interacting electrons through a double barrier was considered and the time - dependence of the width of the resonances was discussed.@xcite in addition , a hall bar with two weak barriers was proposed as an appropriate device for measuring the fractional charge in the quantum hall effect.@xcite however , in all those works , the barriers were considered to be static .",
    "recently , the transport in a luttinger liquid in the presence of a time - dependent impurity was considered.@xcite the model may describe a constricted quantum wire or a constricted hall bar at @xmath3 with a time - dependent voltage at the constriction.@xcite in particular , feldman and gefen @xcite have found an enhancement of the conductance beyond the value of the quantum of conductance , @xmath4 , for strong repulsive electron - electron interactions , @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of several _ time - dependent _ barriers on the transport in an otherwise perfect one - channel luttinger liquid .",
    "we find that due to the interference term between the impurities , the conductance can be enhanced _",
    "also for weak repulsive interactions _",
    ", @xmath6 . in the appropriate limits ,",
    "our work reproduces the previous known results for a _ single time - dependent _ impurity,@xcite and for _ several static _",
    "impurities.@xcite the model is based on the bosonization formalism and the calculations are performed using perturbation theory and the keldysh technique .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section ii we present our model and derive a general expression for the increase of the dc current beyond the quantized value @xmath7 .",
    "we consider only the backscattering contribution and restrict ourselves to the lowest order of the perturbation theory , in which , as it is well - known , forward scattering has no effect on the conductance of one - dimensional systems . in section iii we compare our results with the ones for a single impurity,@xcite and in section iv we discuss the multi - impurity case , with an emphasis on the simplest case of a double - barrier structure , where the novel features are already present .",

    "<S> we find the correction to the total current due to the backscattering of the electrons by the impurities in first order of perturbation theory for a general time - dependent impurity potential . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply this result to a single time - dependent impurity , and show that it reproduces the result obtained by feldman and gefen in ref .  , in particular that the current enhancement occurs only for strong repulsive electron - electron interactions . for the case of two impurities oscillating with the same frequency </S>",
    "<S> , we find a novel effect , namely , that the dc - component of the backscattering current is positive _ even for weak repulsive interactions _ , due to the presence of the interference term induced by spatial correlations in the luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the impurity frequencies at which the enhancement takes place form a band - like structure . in the case of several impurities , </S>",
    "<S> the bands become broader , because of interference effects . </S>"
