    "heavy quark pair and dijet production in electron - proton collisions offer direct probes of the gluons inside the proton .",
    "they allow to map out detailed information about the momentum distribution of the gluons , including the transverse momentum dependence  @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest in the case of transversely polarized protons , which are known to exhibit large left - right asymmetries .",
    "such asymmetries have not yet been studied in heavy quark pair or dijet production in electron - proton collisions , but form a prominent part of the physics case for an electron - ion collider ( eic ) proposed in the u.s .",
    "especially the study of the gluon sivers effect is of interest here .",
    "the sivers effect  @xcite refers to the transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized quarks and gluons inside a transversely polarized proton , where the transverse momentum forms a @xmath1 distribution around the transverse spin direction .    for transversely polarized protons",
    "there is a strong analogy between quark and gluon distributions . for both",
    "there is the sivers effect already mentioned , but there is also a parallel between the helicity flip distributions of transversely polarized quarks and of linearly polarized gluons inside transversely polarized protons , for which there are two each",
    ". even though the latter distributions have different chirality and t behavior , their transverse momentum structures are such that they lead to the same azimuthal asymmetries in certain processes .",
    "this parallel we will discuss explicitly for the quark asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) process ( @xmath2 ) and the gluon asymmetries in open heavy quark pair production ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the transverse momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) of gluons inside transversely polarized protons are also of interest because of their process dependence and their associated small @xmath0 behavior .",
    "tmds are inherently process dependent , expressed through their gauge link dependence . for the processes under consideration here ,",
    "the gauge links are exclusively future pointing , and can be related directly to the gluon tmds appearing at lhc in higgs or heavy scalar quarkonium production ( see section [ sec : links ] ) .",
    "this in principle allows to cross check the results obtained at lhc and eic for unpolarized protons and perhaps for transversely polarized protons too in case a polarized fixed target experiment , called after@lhc  @xcite , will be performed in the future at lhc .",
    "the gluon tmds appearing in these processes correspond to the weiszcker - williams ( ww ) distributions at small @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "recently it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that unlike the dipole gluon tmds ( which have one future and one past pointing gauge link ) , the ww gluon tmds for a transversely polarized proton are suppressed with respect to the unpolarized gluon tmd by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the transverse spin asymmetries in heavy quark pair and dijet production in electron - proton collisions will become suppressed in the small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "a test of this at eic would be very interesting , as the eic can probe both small and large @xmath0 regions . at rhic heavy quarkonia in the forward region are not accessible , but other processes can be studied that in the small-@xmath0 limit probe the dipole distributions that are not suppressed with respect to the unpolarized gluon tmd towards small @xmath0 .",
    "such processes may also be studied very precisely at large @xmath0 at after@lhc  @xcite . for a further discussion",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . obtaining a consistent picture among the various processes at small and large @xmath0 is important for testing our understanding of transverse spin effects and the tmd formalism in general .    in this paper",
    "we will restrict to the ww - type functions that appear in the heavy quark pair and dijet production at an eic .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : def ] we provide the definition of gluon tmds in terms of qcd operators and discuss some phenomenological models which are relevant in the small-@xmath0 region .",
    "details of the calculations of the cross section for heavy quark pair production in dis are discussed in section  [ sec : hq ] , together with the expressions for the azimuthal asymmetries and their upper bounds . in section [ sec : links ] we comment on the process dependence of the gluon tmds involved .",
    "our results for dijet production are given in section  [ sec : dijet ] .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "transverse momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) of gluons inside a proton with four - momentum @xmath4 and spin vector @xmath5 are defined through a matrix element of a correlator of the gluon field strengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 , evaluated at fixed light - front ( lf ) time @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a lightlike vector conjugate to @xmath4 .",

    "the longitudinal and transverse component of the proton spin are defined through the sudakov decomposition @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the proton mass . for an unpolarized ( @xmath18 ) and transversely polarized ( @xmath19 ) proton , the following parametrizations for the correlator in terms of gluon tmds",
    "will be employed : @xmath20 where we have introduced the symmetric and antisymmetric transverse projectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the symmetric part of the correlator @xmath24 , i.e.  @xmath25 , is parametrized by three gluon tmds that are all t - odd . the naming scheme used here for the gluon tmds",
    "is based on the analogy with the quarks  @xcite , but it should be emphasized that the quark and gluon tmds with the same name are not necessarily linked by evolution and can have quite different properties under symmetry operations .",
    "the @xmath26 functions for quarks are chiral - odd and do not mix with the chiral - even @xmath26 functions of the gluons . below",
    "we will make use of the combination @xmath27 which , despite its name , is not related to the well - known transversity distribution @xmath28 for quarks that has no gluonic analogue . although both @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote helicity flip distributions , the quark distribution is chiral - odd , t - even , and survives after transverse momentum integration , while the gluon distribution is chiral - even , t - odd , and vanishes upon integration over transverse momentum .",
    "both distributions require another helicity flip somewhere else in the process , which will require consideration of different types of processes . but as we will show , the angular dependences in such distinct processes can be the same , which in our view justifies the naming scheme .        in order to estimate the size of the asymmetries in the small-@xmath0 limit , we discuss here some aspects of the small-@xmath0 behavior of the various gluon tmds , starting with the linearly polarized gluon distribution .",
    "it has been shown that both the dipole and ww type linearly polarized gluon distributions can be studied in the small-@xmath0 formalism as they both have the same @xmath30 enhancement in the small @xmath0-region as the unpolarized gluon distributions .",
    "it is thus possible to compute them using a saturation model .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model  @xcite , the ww type linearly polarized gluon distribution is given by  @xcite @xmath31 where the saturation scale is defined as @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the transverse area of the nucleon / nucleus . in the mv model",
    ", there is a relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of nucleons inside a nucleus , which is 1 in our case .",
    "although the mv model is argued to work better for a large nucleus , its application to a nucleon target turns out to be quite successful phenomenologically  @xcite . for numerical estimations",
    "a regularized mv model expression is required for the small-@xmath0 ww type gluon tmds  @xcite , @xmath36 } \\left \\ { 1-e^ { - \\frac{r_\\perp^2 q_{s0}^2}{4}{\\rm ln } \\left [ \\frac{1}{r_\\perp^2 \\lambda^2_{qcd } } + e \\right ] } \\right \\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a starting saturation scale to be taken from fits to experimental data .",
    "the ratio between linearly polarized and unpolarized gluon distributions in the mv model is then given by @xmath38}\\ , \\left \\ { 1-e^ { - \\frac{r_\\perp^2 q_{s0}^2}{4}{\\rm ln } \\left [ \\frac{1}{r^2_\\perp \\lambda^2_{qcd } } + e \\right ] } \\right \\}}{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}r_\\perp}{r_\\perp}\\ ,   j_0 \\left ( | \\bm p_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}| r_\\perp \\right ) \\ , \\left \\ { 1-e^ { - \\frac{r_\\perp^2 q_{s0}^2}{4}{\\rm ln } \\left [ \\frac{1}{r_\\perp^2 \\lambda^2_{qcd } } + e \\right ] } \\right \\}}\\,.\\ ] ] numerically we find that @xmath37 should be larger than about 1.1 times @xmath39 , in order for the ratio to stay below 1 for all @xmath40 values ( this is contrary to the claim in @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively one could consider replacing @xmath41 in the numerator by @xmath42 , and take @xmath43 to be sufficiently larger than 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound - mv ] we show the ratio for the case @xmath44 gev@xmath45 at @xmath46 and @xmath47 gev . here",
    "the value @xmath48 gev@xmath45 is based on the gbw model fits to hera data @xcite . if one uses instead the value @xmath49 gev@xmath45 in combination with @xmath50 gev , as in  @xcite , the resulting function would violate the positivity bound in a restricted region of intermediate transverse momentum .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , unlike the dipole case for which the ratio is saturated for all @xmath40 @xcite , the ratio in this ww case is not saturated for @xmath40 values below 10 gev , but still sizeable except for very small @xmath40 values .",
    "sizeable asymmetries may thus also be expected at eic at small but not too small @xmath0 .",
    "now we turn to discuss the behavior of the ww type t - odd gluon tmds in the small @xmath51 limit . at large @xmath40 , three t - odd ww type gluon tmds inside a transversely polarized target can be perturbatively computed  @xcite following the standard collinear twist-3 approach  @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", these calculations have suggested that the ww gluon tmds are suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 as compared to the corresponding dipole type ones .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the asymptotic small-@xmath0 behavior of the ww gluon tmds is discussed in the context of the collinear twist-3 approach without giving the full expressions .",
    "below we present the complete results for these gluon distributions , which are relevant at moderately small @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath55 is the collinear twist-3 quark - gluon correlation function , commonly known as the qiu - sterman function  @xcite , while @xmath56 is a tri - gluon correlation function in which three gluons are in a symmetric color singlet state  @xcite .",
    "the tri - gluon correlation function has the symmetry properties : @xmath57 , which below will be used to simplify the expressions .",

    "the large-@xmath60 expression of the gluon tmd @xmath61 takes a similar form , @xmath62 where again the term proportional to @xmath63 is ignored .",
    "finally , the gluon tmd @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 where the tri - gluon correlation function @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67/z$ ] .",
    "with these results , we can study the small-@xmath0 asymptotic behavior of the ww t - odd gluon tmds .",
    "first of all , as observed in @xcite , there is a complete cancelation between the soft gluon pole contributions and the hard gluon pole contributions in the leading power of @xmath68 for the gluon distributions @xmath69 and @xmath61 in the small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the leading contribution to the gluon tmd @xmath64 also vanishes by invoking the burkardt sum rule  @xcite , @xmath70 which is stable under qcd evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , beyond the leading logarithm @xmath71 approximation , there is no exact cancellation among the various contributions . in the small-@xmath0 limit ,",
    "the subleading contributions to the gluon tmds are given by @xmath72 we emphasize that the calculation presented here is based on the large-@xmath40 dglap - type formalism . unlike the t - odd dipole type gluon tmds  @xcite , these t - odd ww type gluon tmds can not be treated in the small-@xmath0 formalism due to the lack of the leading logarithmic contribution , at least not in a conventional way  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will use these compact results as guidance for modelling the ww gluon tmds at small @xmath0 for all @xmath40 .",
    "for example , if we assume the burkardt sum rule were satisfied at each value of @xmath73 , i.e.  @xmath74 , one obtains the simple result @xmath75 if , on the other hand , we assume that the tri - gluon correlation were zero at some low initial scale and is purely dynamically generated by the qiu - sterman function @xmath76 , one would have ( note that @xmath77 ) @xmath78 finally , if for some reason it turns out that @xmath79 , one obtains : @xmath80 these models will be used below to obtain simple estimates for some ratio of asymmetries .",
    "all three models differ from the leading logarithmic result for the t - odd dipole functions @xmath81 .",
    "the t - odd gluon tmds have to satisfy the following positivity bounds  @xcite @xmath82 in none of the three models we presented , one can satisfy the bounds for all three functions at the same time .",
    "this is in contrast to the dipole model for which all bounds can be saturated simultaneously .",
    "it should be emphasized that for small @xmath0 the maximal values are not expected for the ww - type functions that are probed at eic in heavy quark pair or dijet production .",
    "as mentioned , the ww t - odd gluon tmds are suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 with respect to the ww unpolarized gluon tmd .",
    "the ww t - even gluon tmd @xmath83 is not suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 , but by a logarithm of @xmath84 in the region @xmath85 @xcite , whereas for @xmath86 it was found to saturate the bound .",
    "this is compatible with the sizeable but not maximal effects we obtained in the mv model , fig .",

    "<S> asymmetries in heavy quark pair and dijet production in electron - proton collisions allow studies of gluon tmds in close analogy to studies of quark tmds in semi - inclusive dis . here </S>",
    "<S> we present expressions for azimuthal asymmetries for both unpolarized and transversely polarized proton cases and consider the maximal asymmetries allowed . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are found to be rather sizeable , except in certain kinematic limits which are pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider the small-@xmath0 limit and expectations from a mclerran - venugopalan model for unpolarized and linearly polarized gluons and from a perturbative , large transverse momentum calculation for the t - odd gluon tmds . comparison to related observables at rhic and lhc is expected to provide valuable information about the process dependence of the gluon tmds . in particular this will offer the possibility of a sign change test of the gluon sivers tmd and two other t - odd gluon tmds . </S>",
    "<S> this provides additional motivation for studies of azimuthal asymmetries in heavy quark pair and dijet production at a future electron - ion collider . </S>"
