    "gravitational waves ( gw ) have been already predicted by a. einstein @xcite in 1918 , but they have not yet been observed directly because of the weakness of the signal . however , their existence has been indirectly established by the long - term study of the binary pulsar 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "the giant interferometers currently under development @xcite appear presently to be the most promising gw detectors .",
    "they should reach better sensitivities ( and over larger bandwidths ) than the network of existing resonant bars @xcite , which have already been taking data for years .",
    "+ yet , detecting gw signals will not be straightforward , at least with the first generation of interferometers @xcite .",
    "so , any amplification mechanism such as gravitational lensing ( gl ) should be studied accurately to estimate the improvements it could provide .",
    "+ gl of electromagnetic radiation has been already studied in details ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the same formalism can also be applied to gw , because gravitational radiations propagating on a gravitational background are affected in the same way than electromagnetic radiations @xcite .",
    "+ this topic has been addressed in the literature by many authors with various points of view : cosmological waveguides for gw @xcite , gw detection using gravitational lenses as detectors @xcite and finally , microlensing @xcite and macrolensing @xcite of gravitational radiation in the high frequency approximation as well as in the diffraction case @xcite . in this article",
    "we use the same approach as ref .",
    "+ gl produces magnified images of gw which could be detected more easily if their magnifications are high enough , it could be detected more easily .",
    "similarly , the magnification effect allows one to explore a larger volume of the universe , and thus it increases the number of potentially detectable sources .",
    "yet , we will see in the following that the increase in the number of events is limited for the lens models we study .",
    "but it depends significantly on the particular model of deflector considered .",
    "so , forthcoming papers should study more realistic and sophisticated models to get a more accurate conclusion .",
    "+ on the other hand , the successful amplification of one single signal may strongly help a first detection within a not too far future ; therefore , studying this problem is important , even if the probability of such a lensing event is small .",
    "in addition , it is important to see whether other lensing effects associated to the gw signal amplification ( e.g. delays between images ) can also be used .",
    "+ in the sequel , we analyze the gl effect of gw in the frequency domains which earth and space - based gw detectors are sensitive to .",
    "first , a comparison between electromagnetic waves ( emw ) and gw is reported .",
    "going to gl of gw , the diffraction limit is then estimated : from this computation , it turns out that geometrical optics can be used for earth - based detectors and even for lisa , the space - based interferometer project @xcite , provided that the mass of the deflector is big enough .",
    "then , we compute the increase in the number of gw signals due to gl , and we apply this computation to some lens models . the possibility to use the time delay between two images produced by gl",
    "is also investigated .",
    "finally , some conclusions and prospects for future analysis are reported .",
    "gw @xcite are ripples in the curvature of spacetime , which propagate at the speed of light like emw .",
    "gw are characterized by their wavelength @xmath0 , much smaller than the radius of curvature of the background space - time . as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : t1 ] , emw and gw are very different on many aspects . in particular , the latter are almost insensitive to matter , which makes them important probes for astronomy @xcite . moreover ,",
    "gw detectors are sensitive to the amplitude of the signal  scaling like 1 / distance  while emw are mostly detected through their power , scaling like the square of the distance . finally , the two frequency ranges are also very different : below few tens of khz for gw , above tens of million hz for emw .",
    "+ yet , as both are waves , we assume that all the formula for the gl of emw can be used for gw , provided that the geometrical optics approximation is valid",
    ". therefore , we estimate the validity range of this critical assumption in the following section , by computing the diffraction limit parameter and the diffraction cut - off frequency .",
    "the characteristic angular scale in the gl by a point mass @xmath1 is the einstein angle @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance parameter . the various parameters , such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    ", are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] and defined in the corresponding caption .",
    "+ lensing effects are expected to be significant only when the source , the lens and the observer are aligned within approximately the angle @xmath6 . when the angular size of the source is greater than @xmath6 , the relative influence of the lensing is reduced @xcite by dilution .",
    "wave effects in gl of emw by a point mass @xmath7 depend on the parameter @xmath8    y = = 2 10 ^ 4 ( ) ( ) = 6 10 ^ -5 ( ) ( ) [ eq : e1 ]    where @xmath9 is the wavelength and @xmath10 the frequency of the radiation . using the parameters of a point mass lens ,",

    "[ eq : e3 ]    the parameter @xmath8 measures the number of fresnel zones @xcite contributing to the lensing effect : when @xmath13 geometrical optics applies , while for @xmath14 severe effects of diffraction occur and more precise solutions of the wave equation are required .",
    "+ like in another similar computation @xcite , we estimate the diffraction limit in the case of gw with this formalism . to distinguish from emw ,",
    "the wavelength @xmath15 becomes @xmath16 and the frequency @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in the broad frequency domain of gw @xcite ,",
    "gw detection efforts focus on four frequency bands shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : t2 ] : the extremely low frequency ( elf ) , the very low frequency ( vlf ) , the low frequency ( lf ) and the high frequency domain ( hf ) .",
    "the probes used to search these gw are the following : the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation for the first range , the pulsar timing for the second one , the lisa experiment @xcite for the third one and finally the earth - based detectors ( interferometers and resonant mass ) for the last one .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] shows the diffraction parameter evolution in the full range of frequencies listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : t2 ] .",
    "the calculation has been made for two different values of the lens mass @xmath7 : @xmath19 ( massive black hole case ) and @xmath20 ( galaxy case ) respectively .",

    "+ from fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] we can deduce that @xmath25 in the frequency range sensitive for earth - based detectors ; so , geometrical optics is valid .",
    "this can be true also for lisa : in fact , the region where @xmath26 covers partially the lf range for @xmath27 ( galaxy case ) , but for @xmath28 ( black hole case ) , one is immediately in the diffraction regime . +",
    "we need to estimate a limit on the mass to be sure that geometrical optics is valid also in this domain .",
    "solving @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 gives @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : e1 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath34 , geometrical optics is always valid in the lf domain and so in the hf range , while for @xmath35 , diffraction can not be neglected .",
    "the black hole bh sgr a * is intermediate ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : t4 ] ) and so the lens formalism considered here does not apply in the whole gw lf region .",
    "of course , in the hf domain , the geometrical optics approximation extends to smaller masses .",
    "+ we also consider another method to compute the diffraction limit in the case of gravitational radiation .",
    "if we have a newtonian gravitational lens , i.e. a lens whose effects can be described by the weak field approximation , we can evaluate the diffraction limit for the lens , i.e. a cut - off frequency , @xmath36 , such as geometrical optics is valid at frequencies higher than @xmath36 , while diffraction effect near a caustic are possible at lower frequencies .",
    "+ the cut - off frequency is given by @xcite    _ c = ( ) ^-1 = ( ) ^-1 .",
    "[ eq : e4 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] shows the decrease of the cut - off frequency @xmath36 with the mass @xmath1 . for a mass @xmath1 bigger than @xmath37 ,",
    "the cut - off frequency is lower than @xmath38 considering tab .",
    "[ tab : t2 ] , it appears that geometrical optics is relevant for earth - based detectors because the corresponding relevant frequencies are higher than the cut - off .",
    "therefore , an amplification can be expected under conditions similar to the electromagnetic case . in the lf domain ,",
    "the relevant frequencies for lisa @xcite are lower than the cut - off for @xmath39 ; therefore diffraction effects are expected in suitable conditions for this value of the mass .",
    "however for @xmath40 , geometrical optics remains valid for gw potentially detectable in lisa .",
    "+ in conclusion , in most cases , geometrical optics is valid in particular for earth - based detectors . for this reason we will consider in the sequel that this is the case .",
    "we want to estimate how gl increases the number of detectable gw signals coming from a given direction : if the increase is relevant , gl can be considered as an important tool for gw detection .",
    "calling @xmath41 the number of detectable signals in the absence of gl , the presence of a gravitational lens increases this number by a quantity @xmath42 .",
    "+ first , we estimate the number of gw signals detectable without gl effect . to do this",
    ", we consider arbitrary sources of gw with wave amplitude @xmath43 at a fixed distance @xmath44 from the source scaled ; let @xmath45 be the amplitude at the distance @xmath46 .",
    "we also introduce a threshold , @xmath47 , to model the detection process : if @xmath48 , the signal is detected whereas one has a false dismissal in the other case . from the gw amplitude scaling law , this threshold can be converted in a distance @xmath49 . knowing the detection threshold @xmath47 from gw detectors sensitivity @xcite , we can write the detection condition @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "+ let @xmath52 be the gw pulse density , that is the number of signals per unit volume and per year .",
    "the total number of detectable sources per year up to a distance @xmath46 is @xmath53 , assuming a homogeneous distribution of the source , which is valid at large scale .",
    "+ now , we compute the number of gw signals which can be detected in the presence of gl .",
    "gw detectors are sensitive to the signal amplitude rather than to its intensity .",
    "the gw amplitude @xmath54 is proportional to the square root of the energy flux @xcite ; therefore the lensed amplitude , @xmath55 , on the detector is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the magnification factor and @xmath58 the unlensed gw amplitude .",
    "+ the magnification factor depends on the angle @xmath59 and on the distance @xmath46 of the source , @xmath60 . the function @xmath61 is model - dependent .",
    "the condition for the source to be detected is    r_s < r_0 = ( ) . [ eq : e5 ]    thus , the number of detectable signals in the presence of gl is    n = n _ 0^ ( _ 0^()2r^2dr )  d = n _ 0^^3 ( )  d. [ eq : e6 ]    using eq .",
