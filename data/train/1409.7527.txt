    "coupled oscillator models exhibit complex dynamics that has been observed in a wide range of different fields including physical @xcite and biological @xcite models .",
    "synchronization @xcite , clustering @xcite , chaos @xcite and spontaneous switching between different cluster states @xcite have all been observed in such systems .",
    "other studies have examined coupling between two or more systems that may individually be chaotic , and a wide variety of types of synchronization have been found and analysed ; see for example @xcite .",
    "we examine phase oscillator models that are appropriate if the coupling between oscillators is weak compared to the attraction onto the limit cycle ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the coupling structure and strength are important for the dynamical behaviour of the system , the exact coupling function ( which represents the nonlinearities in the oscillators and the coupling ) has a subtle effect on the collective behaviour of the system .",
    "research into the dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators has long explored the question `` what is the dynamics of a given system ? '' .",
    "a less frequently asked , but also very interesting , question is `` how can we design a coupled system to have specific dynamics ? '' .",
    "this latter question was considered by @xcite who designed cluster states with a prescribed clustering by giving explicit conditions on the coupling function and its first derivative to have a stable cluster state with a specific clustering .",
    "they demonstrate specific coupling functions that give stable cluster states for any partition of the oscillator into groups , regardless the number of oscillators and the size of each cluster .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond @xcite in four ways .",
    "firstly , we examine three - cluster states and show that not only stable cluster states , but also cluster states with specific transverse stability properties can be designed by suitable choice of coupling function . secondly , we give some results on how the transverse stability can be varied independently of the tangential stability and hence exhibit possible bifurcation scenarios from transversely stable clustering .",
    "thirdly , we show examples of how nontrivial cluster states with three inequivalent clusters can be joined into a heteroclinic network .",
    "finally , we generalize some of the bifurcation results to more general multi - cluster states with an arbitrary numbers of clusters .",
    "we use a fourier representation of the coupling function associated with a system of @xmath0 oscillators to design general three - cluster states , as in @xcite . the rest of the paper is organized as follows",
    "; for the remainder of this section we recall some of the notation and previous results on existence and stability of periodic cluster states .",
    "we define a notion of inequivalence of clusters within a cluster state and consider some sufficient conditions for clusters to be inequivalent .",
    "section  [ sec:3cluster ] recalls and extends some basic results on the appearance of tangentially stable but transversely unstable three - cluster states .",
    "we present in theorem  [ thm : transstab ] a characterization of transverse stability , and in corollary  [ cor : couplingfunction ] a result on transverse bifurcation of three - cluster states .",
    "section  [ sec : heteroclinic ] presents what we claim is the smallest possible cluster state with three inequivalent nontrivial clusters ( requiring at least @xmath2 oscillators ) and gives some examples how these may be connected into robust attracting heteroclinic networks @xcite .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] discusses some consequences of this work , including a generalization of corollary  [ cor : couplingfunction ] .      in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath0 phase oscillators that are all - to - all coupled and governed by the following generalization @xcite of kuramoto s model system of coupled phase oscillators : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the phase of the @xmath5 oscillator , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a @xmath8-periodic nonlinear _ coupling function _ that we assume is smooth and represented by a truncated fourier series as in @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the real coefficients and @xmath14 is the number of fourier modes .",
    "note that the coupling function @xmath1 derived from weakly coupled nonlinear phase oscillators will typically have several non - zero modes in its fourier series , even if the oscillators are close to hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "conditions on the coupling function and its first derivative that ensure the existence and stability of desired cluster states in the system ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) are derived in @xcite .",
    "note that the system is invariant under `` spatial '' symmetries @xmath15 acting by permutation of the components and `` temporal '' symmetries @xmath16 given by @xmath17 for any @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we now look at periodic cluster states in a bit more depth .",
    "consider a partition @xmath19 into @xmath20 clusters , where @xmath21 ; each of @xmath22 form a cluster of size @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we say a cluster is a _ multi - cluster _ if @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27th cluster is said to be _ nontrivial _ if @xmath28 .    a periodic orbit @xmath29 of ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) defines an associated _ clustering _ @xmath30 $ ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the same cluster @xmath22 if and only if @xmath33 for some @xmath34 .",
    "it is possible that periodic cluster states can have additional symmetries associated with non - trivial phase shift symmetry @xmath16 ; more precisely , it is known that they can be classified according to decompositions of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 are all positive integers .",
    "[ thm : asiso ] the subsets of @xmath37 that are invariant for ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) because of symmetries of @xmath38 corresponding to isotropy subgroups in the conjugacy class of @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes the semidirect product .",
    "the points with this isotropy have @xmath43 clusters that are split into @xmath44 groups of @xmath45 clusters of the size @xmath46 .",
    "the clusters within these groups are cyclically permuted by a phase shift of @xmath47 .",

    "] as noted in @xcite , a sufficient condition for this is that the phase differences are rationally independent of each other and of @xmath8 .",
    "the following more general statement follows from the definitions and theorem  [ thm : asiso ] ; note that if the phase differences are rationally independent this implies ( c ) .",
    "suppose @xmath56 is a cluster state .",
    "any of the following is a sufficient condition for all clusters to be inequivalent :    * @xmath0 is prime and at least one cluster is nontrivial . *",
    "no two clusters have the same size * the clustering is phase non - degenerate    * proof : * in case ( a ) , theorem  [ thm : asiso ] gives that the only possible factorizations @xmath57 have @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the latter case is ruled out if one of the @xmath60 . in case",
    "( b ) , this also implies that @xmath58 in theorem  [ thm : asiso ] .",
    "finally in case ( c ) , if @xmath61 then there will be clusters which can be chosen such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 if @xmath65 , otherwise we can choose @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that the clustering will be phase degenerate and conversely , phase non - degeneracy implies that @xmath58 and the clusters are inequivalent .       given a partition @xmath67 let us now define the subspace @xmath68 in which clustering occurs as follows :    @xmath69=@xmath70 : if there exists @xmath27 such that @xmath71 then @xmath72    because ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) is equivariant under the action of @xmath15 by permutation of the oscillators and by the circle group @xmath16 ( [ eq : tsymm ] ) , these cluster states @xmath69 are simply fixed point subspaces for groups conjugate to @xmath73 , i.e. with @xmath58 .    the system ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) can be simplified on @xmath69 as follows ; as if @xmath31 is in the @xmath27th cluster then we say @xmath74 and the system reduces to @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the dynamics of a periodic multi - cluster state can then be expressed as @xmath77 for @xmath24 where @xmath78 represents the relative phases of clustering and @xmath79 is the frequency of the periodic orbit .",
    "this means that : @xmath80 where @xmath24 .",
    "computing the difference between the first equation and the remaining ones gives : @xmath81 .",
    "defining @xmath82 as in @xcite means that we can rewrite ( [ eq : frequency ] ) as @xmath83 equations ( [ eq : existenceequations ] ) are conditions that that the coupling function should satisfy for existence of such a periodic cluster state .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for a discussion of stability where it is shown that a cluster state is linearly stable if and only if it is linearly stable in both of the following senses :    * * tangential stability : * ( also called inter - cluster stability @xcite ) to determine the stability of the state to the change in its phases that respects the clustering we consider the linearized stability for perturbations @xmath84 , and writing @xmath85 , gives the following : @xmath86 where , as stated in @xcite , @xmath87 is the matrix : @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the matrix @xmath87 has @xmath20 eigenvalues ( including one trivial value ) and for tangential stability we require that all the other tangent eigenvalues have negative real parts .",
    "this means that a @xmath90 cluster is tangentially stable if : @xmath91 * * transverse stability : * ( also called intra - cluster stability @xcite ) the stability of a periodic state to changes of phases that change the clustering and is obtained by linearizing ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) about @xmath92 , which gives the following : @xmath93 where ( as stated in @xcite ) @xmath94 is given by @xmath95.\\ ] ] this has @xmath96 real eigenvalues that are negative for a transverse stable cluster state ; put otherwise , a cluster state is transversely stable if : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of nontrivial clusters ( i.e. those with more than one oscillator ) .",
    "a coupling function associated with a stable cluster state will satisfy ( [ eq : existenceequations ] ) , ( [ eq : tangentstability ] ) , and ( [ eq : transversestability ] ) and we observe that the number of degrees of freedom on choosing the @xmath99 will always be surplus to requirements @xcite if enough fourier modes are chosen .",
    "note that the above holds for cluster states regardless of whether the clusters are inequivalent or not .",
    "if two clusters are equivalent then the transverse eigenvalues for those clusters will be equal ; if the clusters are inequivalent then generically the transverse eigenvalues for those clusters will be unequal .",
    "we now derive conditions for tangential and transverse stability of three - cluster states for the system ( [ eq : coupledoscillatorsystem ] ) of globally coupled phase oscillators .",
    "consider a periodic state where all clusters are nontrivial ( i.e. the clusters have sizes @xmath100 for @xmath101 , where @xmath102 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath103 ; we explore the special case @xmath2 in more detail in section  [ subsec : n=6 ] .",
    "recall from @xcite that the condition for existence of a three - cluster state is : @xmath104 the tangential stability is determined by ( [ eq : tangentstability ] ) , namely @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 transverse stability is determined by the eigenvalues : @xmath108 where the multiplicities of @xmath109 are @xmath110 respectively .",
    "our first new result is the following sufficient condition for tangential stability of three - clusters :    suppose there is a periodic three - cluster state such that @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",
    "then the cluster is tangentially stable with complex contracting eigenvalues .",
    "* proof : * if @xmath111 then all terms in ( [ eq : mueqn ] ) are negative and so @xmath113 .",

    ". hence the eigenvalues ( [ eq : tangenteigenvalues2004 ] ) are complex with negative real parts and so the cluster is tangentially stable .",
    "the next result demonstrates that the tangential and transverse stability can be set independently of each other .",
    "we define @xmath116 without loss of generality ( renumbering the clusters if necessary ) let us assume that @xmath117 and we demonstrate the following :    [ thm : transstab ] suppose that @xmath1 is such that there is a periodic three - cluster state with non - trivial clusters such that the clusters are tangentially stable and assume that @xmath118 .",
    "then we can classify the transverse stability as follows :    * if @xmath119 then @xmath120 ( all clusters unstable ) . *",

    "note that this is independent of the number of oscillators , although if one or more of the clusters are trivial , the transverse exponent for that cluster is not defined .",
    "if @xmath130 for any @xmath31 then the state will be at a bifurcation point and the stability is not determined at linear order .",
