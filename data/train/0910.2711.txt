    "as a superfluid , the dilute gas bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is a coherent quantum system and behaves in many respects like a single - particle quantum wave .",
    "stationary single particle bound states have wave functions with nodes , giving standing wave patterns . in a bec , nodal structures , such as the one pictured in fig .  [ figintro ] , could be imaged and manipulated directly since the experimental bec wave functions extend over tens of microns . can becs support such patterns as long - lived structures ?",
    "a fundamental difference between single particle and bec wave dynamics is the nonlinearity of the bec evolution that stems from the inter - particle interactions .",
    "this nonlinearity leads to stationary standing wave solutions such as kink states or dark solitons that have been created in bec experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the same nonlinearity also makes the kink states unstable in two and three dimensions @xcite , as has been observed in cold atom experiments @xcite .",
    "the work of this paper was motivated by the basic question : when and how can a bec support a long - lived standing wave induced by a local potential well in dimensions higher than one ? the standing wave gives a stationary interference pattern in the full single - particle density that vanishes @xcite on the surfaces at which the stationary bec wavefunction changes sign .",
    "the existence of such structures may , as we discuss below , impact fundamental science phenomena and cold atom applications .",
    "we analyze the nodal bec wavefunctions in a two - dimensional ( pancake shaped ) bec ; although the trends uncovered by our analysis , suitably generalized , are valid in higher dimensions .",
    "the 2d trap geometry , realized in cold atom experiments @xcite , offers unprecedented prospects for `` wavefunction engineering '' : focused laser - beams can , in principle , access and image each point of the bec wavefunction .",
    "we consider a large , dilute 2d bec in a homogeneous potential that is subjected to a superimposed attractive potential well of cylindrical symmetry with a radius comparable to the coherence length of the surrounding bec .",
    "we study the existence of cylindrically symmetric standing wave solutions of the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation , elucidating their nature and investigating their dynamical stability .",
    "our analysis reveals general trends : as the depth of the finite - ranged potential well increases near the resonance value ( though still above ) at which a single - particle bound state of @xmath0 nodes forms , a pair of @xmath0 node standing wave solutions to the time independent gross - pitaevskii equation appears , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite . upon further deepening of the well",
    ", the last node of one of the two new bec wavefunctions moves inside the well and the corresponding wavefunction resembles that of the single particle bound state .",
    "we refer to this solution as the `` atomic nodal bec '' state . at the same well depth ,",
    "the other @xmath0 node bec - wavefunction resembles the wavefunction of the @xmath1 node atomic bound state with an extra soliton pinned near the potential edge and we refer to it as the `` nonlinear nodal bec '' solution .",
    "of the two @xmath0 node bec wavefunctions , the nonlinear nodal bec state has the lower free energy , but we find that it is always dynamically unstable . if the atomic nodal bec wavefunction varies on a length scale comparable to or greater than the healing length of the surrounding bec , then the atomic bec solution is also unstable when it first forms .",
    "upon further deepening of the well , the stationary atomic nodal bec wavefunction can become stable , then go unstable again as the well depth is further increased  a phenomenon that we refer to as `` reentrant dynamical stability '' .",
    "we show that the stability analysis can be reduced to the simpler study of the spectrum of two distinct single - particle - hamiltonian - like operators .",
    "the size of the stability islands , in terms of the range of well depths , for the atomic nodal bec standing wave depends sensitively on the ratio of the potential range to the bec coherence length : the more the potential range exceeds the coherence length , the broader the regions of instability become .",
    "if the potential well is confined to a spatial region much smaller than the bec coherence length , the regions of instability are confined to narrow intervals of the well depth and the time scale at which the instability sets in increases markedly .",
    "the existence of stable , localized bec standing waves could impact many areas of cold atom physics .",
    "in cold atom traps standing waves could play a role in the physics of localized objects moving through a bec @xcite .",
    "if the object interacts strongly and attractively with bec bosons , the dynamics of object acceleration may bring the bec into an unstable nodal state , disturbing the system and possibly providing another mechanism of invalidating the picture of superfluid , dissipationless motion @xcite . a class of bec objects of particular , fundamental interest consists of a bec with self - localized polaron - like impurity atoms @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently strong impurity - boson attractions , a standing wave bec configuration combined with a localized , nodal impurity wavefunction may give more complex , localized excited state polaron objects .",
    "another class of bec objects that was proposed @xcite consists of mesoscopic ultra - cold molecules .",
    "localized potentials of ions embedded in the bec may capture cold atoms in micron - sized orbits .",
    "if the bec can be engineered to be in an atomic nodal bec state , a gentle lowering of the boson - boson interactions can bring the system into a true molecular state , assuming that no instabilities are encountered in the adiabatic dynamics .",
    "finally , we remark that long - lived , localized standing wave bec patterns may resolve the challenge of observing the bec response to external perturbations .",
    "for instance , a ring bec can sense rotation : as the trap rotates in the plane of the ring , the bec can not follow as such motion would imply vorticity .",
    "hence , in the rotating trap frame , the bec flows .",
    "how can we observe that flow ? if a local dip in the ring potential supports a standing wave bec with fringes ( across which the bec can not flow ) , the rotation would shift the position of the fringes , perhaps destroying the standing wave .    for a more whimsical application of standing wave nodal bec states",
    ", one could look to the hypothesized dark matter becs .",
    "if , as has been speculated , the dark matter haloes that surround most galaxies are scalar becs of ultra - light boson particles @xcite , steep gravitational potentials may support standing wave dark matter bec density patterns .    the relevance of any of the prospects for standing wave becs hinge on their stability . in this manuscript",
    "we study the standing wave patterns and their stability in a linear stability analysis ( dynamical stability ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the multiple , stationary solutions to the gross - piteavskii equation in the presence of an attractive potential well of finite radius .",
    "we describe the linear stability analysis in section iii and we analyze the dynamical stability of the standing wave solutions in section iv . in section",
    "v , we describe a general analysis based on the study of the spectrum of effective single - particle hamiltonians .",
    "section vi concludes .",

    "the natural length scale of the problem is the coherence length of the bec , @xmath23 , defined by @xmath24 . scaling the energy by @xmath5 , the length by @xmath23 , @xmath25 , and the density by @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 , we obtain the dimensionless form of the gross - pitaevskii equation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the scaled external potential @xmath30 , and the large distance boundary condition becomes @xmath31 .",

    "<S> we describe standing wave patterns induced by an attractive finite - ranged external potential inside a large bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . as the potential depth increases , the time independent gross - pitaevskii equation develops pairs of solutions that have nodes in their wavefunction . </S>",

    "<S> although we study the problem in a two - dimensional bec subject to a cylindrically symmetric square well potential of a radius that is comparable to the coherence length of the bec , our analysis reveals general trends , valid in two and three dimensions , independent of the symmetry of the localized potential well , and suggestive of the behavior in general , short- and large - range potentials . </S>",
    "<S> one set of nodal bec wavefunctions resembles the single particle @xmath0 node bound state wavefunction of the potential well , the other wavefunctions resemble the @xmath1 node bound - state wavefunction with a kink state pinned by the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the second state , though corresponding to the lower free energy value of the pair of @xmath0 node bec states , is always unstable , whereas the first can be dynamically stable in intervals of the potential well depth , implying that the standing wave bec can evolve from a dynamically unstable to stable , and back to unstable status as the potential well is adiabatically deepened , a phenomenon that we refer to as `` reentrant dynamical stability '' . </S>"
