    "interest in the electromagnetic production of strangeness from few nucleon targets , such as the proton and the deuteron , dates back to the 1960 s @xcite , but it is comparatively recently that high quality data , suitable for quantitatively testing theoretical models , has become available @xcite",
    ". the strangeness degree of freedom imparts to these reactions the potential to provide fundamental information concerning both the strong and electromagnetic interactions beyond that obtainable from reactions involving just the non - strange baryons . within an effective lagrangian model",
    ", one could use these reactions to search for baryon resonances that decay to strange particles and possibly test su(3 ) symmetry relations among the couplings of resonances within the same su(3 ) multiplets . by comparing photoproduction and electroproduction results",
    ", one might be able to extract information concerning the electromagnetic form factors of baryon resonances . finally , with the aid of a quantitative model for electromagnetic strangeness production from the proton , one could , within the impulse approximation , use results for strangeness production from the deuteron and other light nuclei to study final state interactions involving the @xmath9 and @xmath4 baryons .",
    "much of the theoretical work over the past 20 years or so has been based on effective lagrangian models @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been several coupled channel analyses @xcite that have revealed the need for resonances that had not been previously included in many of the effective lagrangian models . until recently , the fits and models were largely based on older data , and often combined photoproduction data and electroproduction data to generate the fits .",
    "more recent fits have made use of various combinations of recent data from the saphir @xcite , clas @xcite , leps @xcite , and graal @xcite collaborations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that the photoproduction data and the electroproduction data should _ not _ be fit together ; rather one should first generate a model for the basic reaction using photoproduction data alone and then use that model , in conjunction with electroproduction data , to obtain information concerning the electromagnetic form factors of the various resonances in the model .",
    "this consideration , along with the abundance of new data , particularly , polarization data , has motivated us to develop a new model for the reaction @xmath0 over the energy range from threshold up to a center - of - momentum ( c.m . )",
    "energy of 2.2 gev .",
    "although the clas data extends up to 2.6 gev , the lack of @xmath10-channel resonances in our model with masses above 2.2 gev precludes a reliable treatment of the higher energy data . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] , the fits involve a subtle interference between @xmath10-channel contributions to the reaction on the one hand and @xmath11 and @xmath12-channel contributions on the other hand , which , to be effective , requires that the @xmath10-channel resonances included in a particular fit have masses spanning the whole energy range of that fit .    the model is similar to that described in refs .",
    "@xcite , but has been expanded to include spin @xmath2 baryon resonances in both the @xmath10 and @xmath11-channels , in addition to the spin @xmath13 and spin @xmath14 resonances included in the earlier work .",
    "the present model also includes several higher energy , less well - established resonances in the @xmath10-channel that were not included in the earlier work . finally , the fits described here are much more elaborate than those described in refs .",
    "@xcite in that both single and double polarization data are included in the present fits .",
    "the reaction model is described in some detail in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] .",
    "two separate fits were generated .",
    "the first fit has su(3 ) symmetry constraints imposed on the born terms in all three channels .",
    "these constraints , along with inputted empirical values for the baryon magnetic moments , require particular relationships between the various born terms and also , in conjunction with other considerations , provide a range of values for the @xmath15 coupling .",
    "this is discussed more fully in sec .",
    "[ sec - fitting ] . in the second fit",
    ", the @xmath15 coupling was allowed to move outside the su(3 ) symmetry range and assume whatever value yielded the best fit to the data .",
    "the second fit obtained is nearly identical to the first fit and yielded a @xmath7 per degree of freedom that differs from that of the first fit by less than @xmath16 .",
    "for these reasons , only results derived from the first fit are presented here .",
    "we have used all recently published results for the spin observables , @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite in our fits . to avoid difficulties associated with inconsistencies between different data sets @xcite ,",
    "only the most recent cross section data from the clas collaboration @xcite were used in the fits .",
    "further details concerning the fitting procedure are contained in sec .",
    "[ sec - fitting ] .    the resulting fit , along with several figures illustrating the quality of the fits , are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] .",
    "[ sec - results ] also contains some concluding remarks and a brief discussion of future work .",
    "the reaction model incorporates contributions in the @xmath10-channel , @xmath11-channel , and @xmath12-channel .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - chan ] .",
    "the @xmath10-channel contributions include the born term with an intermediate proton and contributions in which an intermediate nucleon resonance is excited . similarly , the @xmath11-channel born contributions with the excitation of an intermediate @xmath9 or @xmath4 baryon are supplemented by contributions involving the excitation of an intermediate hyperon resonance . in the @xmath12-channel , contributions from both @xmath17 and @xmath18 exchange are included , as well as the born contribution involving ground state kaon exchange .    in the various channels ,",
    "the reaction amplitudes have the general forms @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the intermediate 4-momenta in the various channels , the @xmath25 s are the electromagnetic and strong interaction vertices , and the @xmath26 s are the associated intermediate baryon and meson propagators . in all channels",
    "the forms of both the electromagnetic vertices and the strong interaction vertices depend on the spin and the parity of the intermediate hadron that is excited .    in the @xmath12-channel ,",
    "the two vertices are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 for an intermediate ground state kaon ( the @xmath12-channel born term ) , by @xmath29 and @xmath30 for an intermediate @xmath17 resonance and by @xmath31 and @xmath32 for an intermediate @xmath18 resonance .",
    "here , @xmath33 is the photon polarization 4-vector and @xmath34 is a scaling mass , set equal to 1000 mev , that is introduced to make the electromagnetic coupling strengths dimensionless .",
    "the corresponding kaon resonance propagators both have the same form : @xmath35 where the label @xmath36 now refers to either of the two resonances .",
    "we note that the propagator employed here , in contrast with that used in refs .",
    "@xcite , does not contain a width since the intermediate energies in the @xmath12-channel lie well below the thresholds of any possible decay channels .    in the @xmath10 and @xmath11-channel",
    "born contributions and in those contributions arising from the excitation of intermediate spin @xmath13 resonances , we employ standard expressions for the electromagnetic vertices and use the pseudoscalar form for the strong interaction vertices . for positive parity intermediate baryons ,",
    "this gives @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined by its relation to the transition magnetic moment , @xmath41 @xmath42 is the mass of the incoming or outgoing baryon ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , and @xmath45 is the mass of the intermediate baryon .",
    "the corresponding expressions for negative parity intermediate baryons just have the @xmath46 factor transposed from the strong interaction vertex to the electromagnetic vertex . for intermediate protons",
    ", there is an additional term , @xmath47 arising from the proton s charge . for the spin @xmath13 propagator ,",
    "we employ , in agreement with other authors , a relativistic breit - wigner form , @xmath48 where the width @xmath49 is non - zero only in the @xmath10-channel resonance contributions .    in the @xmath10 and @xmath11-channel contributions from intermediate spin @xmath14 baryons ,",
    "a number of different forms have been employed for the vertices and the propagator .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a form for the spin @xmath14 propagator in the @xmath10-channel in which the intermediate baryon mass appearing in the numerator and projection operator of the rarita - schwinger propagator was replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "this was motivated by the desire to ensure gauge invariance off - shell .",
    "however , use of the same prescription in the @xmath11-channel leads to unphysical singularities .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the propagator employed in ref .",
    "@xcite does not satisfy the differential equation that defines the propagator as a green s function .",
    "for these reasons , we employ the standard rarita - schwinger form for the spin @xmath14 propagator and use forms for the corresponding vertices that are similar to those introduced in ref .",
    "however , in contrast to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , we make no attempt to include off - shell terms in the vertices .",
    "the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that these terms , as well as off - shell terms in the propagator , have a relatively modest effect on the calculated observables .",
    "the resulting vertices for positive parity spin @xmath14 intermediate baryons take the forms @xmath51 and @xmath52 \\gamma_5 , \\label{phv32}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the 4-momentum of the incoming or outgoing ground state baryon . as for the spin @xmath13 contributions , the negative parity vertices just have the @xmath46 factor transposed from one vertex to the other vertex .",
    "note in these expressions that the strong interaction coupling has been divided by the pion mass , rather than the kaon mass as in ref .",
    "this makes it easier to compare our coupling strengths with the corresponding pion couplings for the purpose of testing su(3 ) symmetry relations among the couplings .",
    "the rarita - schwinger propagator is obtained by multiplying the spin @xmath13 propagator given by eq .",
    "( [ rprop12 ] ) on the right by the spin @xmath14 projection operator @xmath54    with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , most of the earlier work on the photoproduction of strangeness does not include contributions from intermediate states with spin @xmath2 , even though there are several well - established baryon resonances with this spin below 2 gev .",
    "@xcite and some of the later work do include spin @xmath2 resonances in the @xmath10-channel but not in the @xmath11-channel . to our knowledge",
    ", the present work is the first analysis to include resonances with spin greater than @xmath14 in _ both _ the @xmath10 and @xmath11-channels .",
    "for the spin @xmath2 vertices , we employ forms similar to those given in ref .",
    "@xcite but modified so as to be consistent with the forms adopted here for the spin @xmath14 vertices .",
    "again , we do not include any off - shell terms in the spin @xmath2 vertices . for positive parity intermediate resonances ,",
    "the resulting vertices are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 \\frac{p_{\\gamma}^{\\nu}}{m_{\\pi}}.                  \\label{phv52}\\ ] ] as for the other @xmath10 and @xmath11-channel vertices , the corresponding negative parity vertices just have the @xmath46 factor transposed from one vertex to the other vertex .",
    "the corresponding propagator is constructed by multiplying the spin @xmath13 propagator on the right by the spin @xmath2 projector operator , @xmath57 [ p52 ] with @xmath58 where @xmath59      the intermediate nucleon resonances excited in the @xmath10-channel generally lie at energies above the thresholds for decay into various decay channels .",
    "thus , the propagators employed for the @xmath10-channel resonances need to include widths , and these widths are generally required rather far off the resonance mass shells .",
    "most previous studies have ignored the off - shell nature of the resonances and simply used the on - shell values of the widths . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model was proposed to dynamically generate widths off - shell by making use of partial width data summarized in the particle data tables @xcite .",
    "the full width is first decomposed into a number of different decay channels . in each such channel , the off - shell energy and momentum dependence of the partial width",
    "is then treated using an effective lagrangian model with the required coupling strength adjusted to yield the empirical on - shell branching ratio for decay into that channel .",
    "two types of decays are considered  two - body decays in which both decay products are stable under the strong interaction , and decays in which one of the decay products is itself unstable , so that ultimately more than two decay products result .",
    "decays of the first type all involve the decay of a nucleon resonance into a pseudoscalar meson and a spin @xmath13 ground state baryon . in the resonance rest frame , the corresponding widths are given by the expressions @xmath60 ,   \\label{gam12p}\\ ] ] @xmath61 ,   \\label{gam12m}\\ ] ] @xmath62 ,   \\label{gam32p}\\ ] ] @xmath63 ,   \\label{gam32m}\\ ] ] @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the pseudoscalar meson decays , where @xmath66 is the channel momentum , and @xmath42 and @xmath67 are the mass and energy of the baryon decay product . to obtain the total contribution to the width from two - body channels at a particular energy , the partial widths",
    "are summed over all two - body decay channels open at that particular energy .",
    "any part of the full on - shell decay width not accounted for by the two - body decays discussed above is attributed to decays in which one of the decay products is itself unstable under the strong interaction .",
    "these latter decays are approximated as decays into either a ground state baryon and a meson resonance or as a decay into a ground state meson and a baryon resonance . in practice , for the low lying nucleon resonances , only decays into the @xmath68 , the @xmath69 , and the @xmath70 channels are considered .",
    "the @xmath68 channel is treated as a decay into a nucleon and a scalar meson of zero width .",
    "the corresponding decay widths are the same as those for two - body pseudoscalar decays of resonances with the opposite parity .",
    "the two remaining channels both involve a stable ground state hadron and an unstable resonance which itself has a width .",
    "to treat such decays , we employ the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which involves an integration over the unstable decay product mass of the decay phase space factor multiplied by a breit - wigner distribution function .",
    "in particular , for decay into either channel , the partial width is given by the general expression @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the coupling strength , @xmath73 is the decay phase space factor , and the integration limits are defined by @xmath74 in the last expressions , @xmath75 is the threshold value of the center - of - momentum energy for decay into that channel , and @xmath76 is the stable decay product mass ( either @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) . the breit - wigner distribution function has the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the unstable decay product width , @xmath81 is the mass of the unstable decay product at the center of its mass distribution , and the parameter @xmath82 is defined by the normalization requirement @xmath83    the vertices for decays of spin @xmath13 resonances into the @xmath70 channel are related to those for decays of spin @xmath14 resonances into the @xmath84 channel by just the interchange of the initial and final baryon states .",
    "the vertices for decays of spin @xmath14 and spin @xmath2 resonances into the @xmath70 channel each involve two independent couplings , only one of which can be fixed by the on - shell partial width . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we keep , in each case , only the coupling of lowest order in the channel momentum . with that proviso ,",
    "the phase space factors for decays into the @xmath70 channel are given by @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mass that is integrated over in the mass distribution , @xmath66 is the channel momentum for that value of @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "like the decays of spin @xmath14 and spin @xmath2 resonances into the @xmath70 channel , decays into the @xmath69 channel generally involve vertices with two independent couplings . for the spin @xmath13 resonances",
    "decays , we adopt the same procedure as used in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the spin @xmath14 and spin",
    "@xmath2 resonance decays , we simply drop the couplings of higher order in the momenta and energies .",
    "this yields the phase space factors @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "this is generally not the case .",
    "hence , for these resonances , we employ energy - independent widths which are treated as parameters to be varied in the fits .",

    "as reflected in their particle data table listings , they are predicted by quark models @xcite , and some of them have been included in another recent analysis of photoproduction data @xcite . in accord with our philosophy",
    "to incorporate only resonances for which there is independent empirical evidence , we have _ not _ included the so - called `` missing '' @xmath115 resonance at 1900 mev in our final results .",
    "although this resonance has been predicted in quark models @xcite and has been included in several other analyses of strangeness photoproduction @xcite , there has so far been little evidence for its existence in any other reactions .",
    "we will comment on this further in sec .",

    "instead , their widths are treated as energy - independent parameters to be determined in the fits to the data .",
    "the complete set of varied parameters thus includes the coupling strength products in all three channels and the total widths of the resonances in table  [ tab - res2 ] .",

    "the parameter @xmath128 is also restricted by su(3 ) symmetry relations and by other considerations . a recent study by general and cotanch @xcite based on a generalized goldberger - treiman relation in conjunction with the dashen - weinstein sum rule , arrived at the pair of constraints , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    "first , it will be noted that the number of hyperon resonances appearing in this table is much smaller than the number appearing in table  [ tab - resonances ] .",
    "we found that attempts to incorporate all of the hyperon resonances listed in table  [ tab - resonances ] resulted in unacceptably large coupling products for many of these resonances accompanied by enormous parameter uncertainties .",
    "this clearly indicates that a model that incorporates all of the possible @xmath11-channel resonances is too rich ; i.e. , the photoproduction reaction is not sensitive to particular @xmath11-channel contributions and thus , can not be used to unambiguously determine individual @xmath11-channel coupling products .",
    "the reason for this is obvious once one notes that the kinematic variable @xmath11 in the photoproduction reaction is usually negative .",
    "this makes the denominators of the intermediate baryon propagators in the @xmath11-channel always large in magnitude and insensitive to the baryon mass .",
    "thus , individual contributions to the reaction amplitude in the @xmath11-channel are difficult to distinguish from one another and become highly correlated since many different combinations of the @xmath11-channel coupling products yield the same result in the reaction matrix element .",
    "two consequences of this are very large parameter uncertainties and the possibility of a run away effect in the fitting routine in which small increases in @xmath203 result from simultaneous huge increases in correlated couplings .    to avoid this difficulty , we systematically removed those @xmath11-channel resonances with the largest parameter uncertainties and then refit the remaining parameters , accepting the result if the resulting @xmath203 did not increase by more than a few percent over the value obtained with all resonances included .",
    "this procedure led to reduced values of the remaining @xmath11-channel coupling products and greatly reduced parameter uncertainties , finally culminating in the values listed in table  [ tab - results ] .",
    "attempts to further reduce the number of @xmath11-channel resonances incorporated in the model led to larger increases in @xmath203 ( @xmath204 or more ) than we deemed acceptable .",
    "as the procedure was carried out , the values obtained for the @xmath10 and @xmath12-channel coupling products did not shift significantly , indicating that these coupling products are not sensitive to the model employed for the @xmath11-channel .    even with the reduction in the number of @xmath11-channel resonances included in the fit , the parameter uncertainties associated with the hyperon resonances are still rather large , often larger than the magnitudes of the couplings themselves .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath11-channel couplings are still highly correlated and rather poorly determined . evidently , the photoproduction reaction is of limited value as a means for studying the couplings of hyperon resonances .",

    "detailed examination of the matrix elements in the model reveals that the @xmath10-channel matrix elements , the @xmath11-channel matrix elements , and the @xmath12-channel matrix elements , when taken individually , all increase monotonically with energy .",
    "this indicates that successful reproduction of the data results from a subtle interference between the matrix elements in different channels . because the mandelstam variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 are generally negative over the energy range of interest here , the individual resonance contributions in the @xmath11 and @xmath12-channel are only weakly dependent on the energy . by contrast",
    "the individual @xmath10-channel contributions are strongly energy dependent , especially at energies near the resonance masses .",
    "consequently , to successfully fit the data within a given energy range with reasonable parameter values , it is necessary to include nucleon resonances with masses that span the full energy range considered .",
    "since only nucleon resonances with masses up to 2.2 gev were included in the fits , attempts to fit the data beyond 2.2 gev resulted in a @xmath203 that increased rapidly with @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , because of the subtle interferences among the three channels that are fine tuned by the fit , fits obtained within a given range of energies can not be extended significantly beyond that range .",
    "indeed , one finds that beyond the energy range of the fit , the calculated cross sections increase precipitously with energy , in marked contrast with the data .",
    "in summary , we have presented a new fit of the kaon photoproduction data from the clas collaboration using an effective lagrangian model . in this fit",
    "the born terms were all fixed at values imposed by su(3 ) symmetry constraints and other considerations .",
    "a second fit , in which the value of the born parameter @xmath128 was allowed to vary while requiring the other born parameters to satisfy su(3 ) relations among the various born couplings , did not differ significantly from the first fit . in both fits , data for the unpolarized cross section , the hyperon polarization asymmetry , and two double polarization observables from threshold up to 2.2 gev",
    "were included .    in general , the new fit",
    "yields good representations of both the cross section data and the spin observables .",
    "one exception is the forward - angle cross section data around 1.9 gev .",
    "this suggests that our fit is perhaps missing one or more resonances in this energy range  a subject of future work .",
    "further improvements to our model should result from including other polarization observables .",
    "the clas collaboration expects to produce multiple spin observables in the near future @xcite including data with a polarized target and a linearly polarized photon beam .",
    "such data should provide more constraints and potentially enable inclusion of resonances that are not necessary in our present fit .",
    "the results of this work can be employed to study the electroproduction of kaons from the proton , i.e. , the reaction @xmath212 .",
    "the latter reaction involves a virtual , rather than a real , photon in the strangeness production interaction and thus , requires electromagnetic form factors at the photon vertices .",
    "if one uses the photoproduction fits described here to represent the underlying reaction mechanism in the electroproduction reaction , then one can use electroproduction data to study the electromagnetic form factors associated with the intermediate hadrons in the different reaction channels .",
    "of course , the electroproduction reaction involves longitudinal , as well as transverse , photons , but the corresponding contributions to the reaction amplitude are related through the lorentz structure of the interaction vertices , i.e. , through the fact that the photon polarization vector is a lorentz 4-vector .",
    "thus , it should be possible to extract important information concerning the electromagnetic form factors of hadronic resonances using the fits described here in conjunction with electroproduction data .",
