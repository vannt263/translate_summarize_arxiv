    "an epoch of accelerated expansion in the early universe , inflation , dynamically resolves many cosmological puzzles of the hot big bang model , such as homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the universe @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the generation of a spectrum of primordial fluctuations in the early universe is a crucial ingredient of all inflationary models .",
    "these fluctuations can explain the generation of all ( classical ) inhomogeneities that can be seen in our universe , from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies to the large scale structure ( lss ) in the form of ( clusters of ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "the inflationary paradigm therefore reconciles big bang cosmology with the appearance of an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "in addition , many models of inflation @xcite make accurate predictions allowing for observations of ever increasing variety and quality to discriminate between the various candidates .",
    "one such prediction concerns the possible formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "indeed , it was realized already some time ago that the spectrum of primordial fluctuations could lead to the production of pbhs @xcite . for this generation mechanism to be efficient",
    ", one typically needs a `` blue '' spectrum @xcite .",
    "this means that the amplitude of density fluctuations must be much higher at the small length scales relevant for pbh formation than at the much larger length scales probed by data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "this discrepancy of scales makes pbh formation also a unique probe of cosmological inflation ; in particular , the constraint that not too many pbhs should have been produced has been used to limit the power spectrum at small length scales , which in turn allows to constrain models of inflation @xcite . for single ",
    "field inflation models , the relevant parameter space is defined by the scalar spectral index @xmath5 ; the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations @xmath6 ; the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath1 ; and we will see that the `` running of running of the spectral index '' , @xmath4 , is also important for pbh formation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to make use of the recent observational bounds on these parameters derived from the combined cmb data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe seven year data ( wmap7 ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite , as well as data on the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite , the hubble constant @xmath7 @xcite , and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we will investigate a wide range of inflationary models , checking whether they still can give rise to significant pbh formation given these constraints .",
    "in so doing , we also check whether these models can account for a sizably negative running of the spectral index , as ( weakly ) favored by current data .",
    "we focus on models where the cosmic expansion was driven by a single , self  interacting scalar inflaton field @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we only consider models with simple potentials , which have been suggested for reasons not related to pbh formation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present a brief review of the press - schechter formalism @xcite describing pbh formation . in section 3",
    "we first summarize the current bounds on the observational parameters , and review their calculation from the potential of the inflaton field .",
    "we then systematically analyze three small  field and five large  field models . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "pbhs are black holes that result from the collapse of density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "they are very sensitive cosmological probes for physics phenomena occurring in the early universe .",
    "they could be formed by many different mechanisms , _",
    "e.g. _ , from initial density inhomogeneities @xcite , a softening of the equation of state @xcite ( _ e.g. _ in phase transition or during the preheating period after inflation ) , collapse of cosmic string loops @xcite , bubble collisions @xcite , collapse of domain walls @xcite , etc .",
    "the idea that large amplitude matter overdensities in the early universe could have collapsed through self  gravity to form pbhs was first studied by zeldovich and novikov @xcite , and then by hawking @xcite .",
    "this theory suggests that large amplitude inhomogeneities in the early universe overcome internal pressure forces and collapse to form black holes . a lower threshold for the amplitude of such homogeneities @xmath9 ,",
    "was first provided by carr @xcite , giving @xmath10 at the time of radiation domination ( rd ) .. we have shown @xcite that pbhs abundance is sensitive to the value of @xmath11 . ]",
    "the probability of pbh formation is a useful tool to constrain the mean amplitude of inhomogeneities on scales which can not be probed by any other method .",
    "since pbhs behave like matter , their contribution to the energy density increases with time during the rd epoch . for this reason ,",
    "the pbhs formed considerably before the end of rd are the most relevant to cosmology .",
    "we have focused in our study @xcite on these kind of pbhs and we also considered the standard case of pbhs formation , which applies to scales which have left the horizon at the end of inflation .",
    "we only consider gaussian and spherically symmetric perturbations and we assume that the mass of the pbh formed is proportional to the mass of the horizon mass at horizon entry , @xmath12 . during the radiation era @xcite . ]    generally , for gaussian primordial fluctuations , the probability density @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density contrast averaged over a sphere of radius @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 here , the dispersion ( mass variance ) @xmath17 is computed using a gaussian window function @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the power spectrum of @xmath14 which is related to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations on comoving hypersurfaces as follows @xcite : @xmath21 therefore the probability @xmath22 that a pbh with mass @xmath23 is formed on a scale @xmath15 when that scale reenters the hubble radius , is given by is such a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath14 above @xmath11 that the upper cutoff @xmath24 is not important . ]",

    "@xmath37 describes the _ slope _ of the power spectrum at scales @xmath39 , whereas @xmath38 fixes the _ normalization _ of the spectrum at @xmath40 .",
    "the two powers are identical if the spectral index is strictly constant , _",
    "i.e. _ if neither @xmath5 nor @xmath41 depend on @xmath15 . however , in this case cmb data imply @xcite that @xmath42 is close to unity .",
    "eqs.([sigmar ] ) and ( [ eqn ] ) then give a very small variance , leading to essentially no pbh formation .",

    "the result of this calculation is shown in figure  [ fig : pbh ] . here",
    "we have fixed @xmath56 , and show results for the threshold @xmath57 . due to hawking radiation @xcite , pbhs contributing to dark matter ( dm ) today must have @xmath58 g ; at this mass , they saturate the dm relic density if @xmath59 @xcite .",

    "current data favor a negative or at best slightly positive value of @xmath1 at the cmb pivot scale , as well as a spectral index at the pivot scale somewhat below @xmath47 .",
    "the first two terms in eq.([nofr ] ) can thus not lead to pbh formation ; so in the next section we study single ",
    "field inflation models by also considering the `` running of the running of the spectral index '' for pbhs formation .",
    "when possible , we will compare this to an exact calculation of the power of density perturbation at scales relevant for pbh formation .",
    "most models of inflation predict an approximately scale  free spectrum with a spectral index @xmath5 ( as well as @xmath41 ) close to the scale  invariant ( harrison  zeldovich ) case @xmath64 .",
    "as shown , a significant number of long  lived pbhs can only be produced for @xmath65 ( a `` blue spectrum '' ) , since these values lead to more power on small scales @xcite .",
    "observational limits ( both from hawking radiation and the fact that pbhs must not overclose the universe ) strongly constrain @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this , therefore , yields a constraint on inflationary models that is independent of the cosmological constraints from the cmb and lss .",
    "however , we will see below that in most simple models of inflation constraints on model parameters derived from the latter are far more stringent than the pbh constraint , to the point of making the formation of long  lived pbhs impossible .",
