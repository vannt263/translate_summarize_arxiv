    "mean - field approximations@xcite , such as the finite temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) , are standard for describing nuclei at finite temperature .",
    "collective excitations of the system are obtained by linearizing the time - dependent hf equations around the static hf solution , leading to the finite temperature random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "however , this treatment is inadequate for situations where various nuclear configurations compete and have comparable free energies , which causes observables to fluctuate widely about their mean values .",
    "this is the case , for example , in the vicinity of a shape transition from a spherical to a deformed nucleus , where various discontinuities predicted in the mean - field approach are smoothed in the finite nuclear system by the presence of fluctuations .",
    "large fluctuations in the nuclear shape also play an important role in giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) whose frequency is strongly coupled to the quadrupole deformation . in the adiabatic approximation , the observed gdr strength function is obtained by integrating the strength function that corresponds to each quadrupole configuration over all possible configurations weighted by their respective boltzmann factor @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a systematic description of fluctuations can be obtained in the framework of the auxiliary - field path integral ( hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite ) . in this framework",
    "the original many - body propagator ( in imaginary time ) is decomposed into a superposition of one - body propagators describing non - interacting fermions moving in a fluctuating external time - dependent potential ( auxiliary fields ) .",
    "the expectation value of any observable is represented as a weighted average of its expectation values in the corresponding non - interacting systems . applying the method of steepest descent one can obtain self - consistent mean - field approximations at finite temperature . by taking into account small amplitude time - dependent fluctuations of the auxiliary fields around the mean - field solution in the gaussian approximation one",
    "rederives the rpa @xcite .",
    "the path integral representation also constitutes a starting point for exact numerical solution of the many - body problem where the auxiliary field integration is performed by monte carlo techniques that were recently developed for strongly correlated electron systems @xcite and for the interacting nuclear shell model @xcite . in the latter case a practical solution to the monte carlo sign problem @xcite , which is generic to all fermionic systems , enables the study of nuclear properties in medium and heavy mass nuclei using realistic effective interactions .",
    "the auxiliary field formulation also suggests new approximation schemes which are non - perturbative , the simplest of which is the static path approximation ( spa ) @xcite @xcite . here",
    ", the path integral is approximated by summing over the time - independent fields only , weighted by the appropriate boltzmann factor .",
    "this amounts to averaging over all possible static mean - field configurations rather than the self - consistent ones alone .",
    "the spa has been used to calculate free energies and level densities in nuclei and was found to be superior to the mean - field approximation . in particular , it accounts for the enhancement of level density due to thermal fluctuations of the shape @xcite .",
    "more recently the approximation has also been applied to the calculation of strength functions @xcite . at high temperatures",
    "the spa partition function approaches the exact result .",
    "however , as the temperature decreases the spa becomes inaccurate since time - dependent fluctuations about the mean - field configurations can no longer be neglected .",
    "this is manifested especially in the strength function where even its first moment is significantly underestimated @xcite .    recently , a method to improve the spa has been proposed for the partition function @xcite . in this approach contributions from time - dependent fields in the neighborhood of each static field are incorporated perturbatively to the second order in their amplitudes .",
    "when one considers such time - dependent fluctuations around the equilibrium configuration only , one obtains the rpa corrections to the partition function .",
    "however , in the proposed approach such small amplitude time - dependent fluctuations are taken around each static configuration of the auxiliary fields and the static integration is still fully retained . at even lower temperatures some of these time - dependent fluctuations can become unstable and the approximation breaks down . however",
    ", this happens only at temperatures below the phase transition , when the temperature drops below the largest imaginary rpa frequency .",
    "we remark that as a saddle point develops in the nuclear free energy surface below the transition temperature , it is still possible that the imaginary rpa frequencies are small enough in magnitude that the time - dependent fluctuations are all stable ( although there is an unstable direction in the static free energy surface ) .",
    "this approximation scheme has been applied to free energy and level density calculations in simple models and shown to work well down to low temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether incorporating small time - dependent fluctuations provides a significant improvement over the spa evaluation of quantities other than the partition function .",
    "this paper will explore the validity and applicability of this scheme , which we term the perturbed static - path approximation ( pspa ) , for the calculation of expectation values of observables at finite temperature as well as of strength functions .",
    "previous work employed a formulation of the pspa based on ordinary quantum - mechanical perturbation theory @xcite , which was specialized for free energy calculations and is not easily extended to other quantities .",
    "we therefore reformulate it in a general way , using many - body methods , and apply it to the calculation of observables and strength functions . by testing the pspa in a solvable model",
    "we find that the pspa results agree closely with the exact solution for observable expectation values and for low moments of the strength function .",
    "the strength function itself is approximated well at high temperatures and also at low temperatures for a certain regime of the model s parameters , although the low - temperature results generally do not improve much on the spa .",
    "we discuss possible improvements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the auxiliary - field path integral formalism and in section iii we formulate the pspa for the partition function .",
    "section iv discusses the application of the pspa to the calculation of expectation values of one- and two - body operators .",
    "finally , in section v we present a treatment of the strength function and its lowest two moments in this framework .",
    "we illustrate the pspa and compare it to other approximations in a simple model whose exact solution is given in appendix b.",

    "we note that the gaussian approximation in ( [ dynz ] ) leads to a convergent integral only if @xmath124 for all @xmath125 , i.e. @xmath126 for all @xmath125 and @xmath127 . when all rpa frequencies are real , these conditions are always met .",
    "in particular this is the case if @xmath53 is a local minimum of the static free energy i.e. a stable mean - field configuration @xmath75 ( thouless theorem @xcite ) . at zero temperature @xmath128 and an imaginary rpa frequency",
    "would lead to a breakdown of the gaussian approximation .",

    "if the largest modulus of all imaginary rpa frequencies is below @xmath129 , then the quadratic fluctuations in @xmath37 are still stable .",

    "note that at @xmath136 instability occurs as soon as some @xmath113 becomes imaginary whereas at @xmath137 an instability develops only for a sufficiently imaginary @xmath113 .",
    "these instabilities can be ignored when they occur at fields for which the static free energy is large . in practical applications",
    "the pspa breaks down only at temperatures that are significantly below the shape transition temperature , when the saddle point in the static free energy surface becomes unstable to small amplitude time - dependent fluctuations .    in the case ( [ manyv ] ) where the interaction is a sum of several separable interactions we have an auxiliary - field variable @xmath56 for each @xmath57 . assuming @xmath138 ( this is always possible by redefining @xmath57 ) , expression ( [ averageu ] ) becomes @xmath139 with @xmath140 the correction factor @xmath78 is then generalized from ( [ dynzgauss ] ) into @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the @xmath11-dimensional matrix defined in ( [ absubr ] ) . as shown in appendix a @xmath143 where @xmath113 are again the rpa frequencies at finite temperature .",
    "we then obtain for the pspa partition function an expression similar to ( [ zpspa ] ) , except that the integral over @xmath53 is replaced by an integration over @xmath11 static fields @xmath144 .",
    "when one or more of the @xmath145 in ( [ manyv ] ) are negative and a representation of the type ( [ gaussidenneg ] ) is used in the hs transformation , the one - body hamiltonian @xmath46 in ( [ statbasis ] ) becomes non - hermitean , so that its eigenvalues @xmath146 are in general complex and the associated one - body partition function can be negative .",
    "it was recently pointed out @xcite that the static fields which correspond to these `` repulsive '' terms in the interaction do not represent large amplitude thermal fluctuations , and can simply be treated in a saddle point approximation .",
    "this amounts to keeping the exact integration over the static `` attractive '' fields but taking the mean - field solution for the static `` repulsive '' fields for every configuration of the `` attractive '' fields in the integrand .",
    "an alternative way to approach `` repulsive '' interactions is to subtract from the hamiltonian a term proportional to @xmath147 ( @xmath148 is the particle number operator ) with a coefficient large enough so that the two - body part of the hamiltonian becomes a negative - definite quadratic form ( as in the case where all @xmath145 in ( [ manyv ] ) are positive ) .",
    "however , by doing this we also increase the magnitude of `` attractive '' terms and it remains to be investigated whether the spa and pspa would still work well for such modified hamiltonians . note that the subtracted term is just a constant for a fixed number of particles .    to illustrate our results we apply the formalism to a simple many - body model ( a variant of the lipkin model @xcite ) based on a @xmath149 algebra which is defined and solved in appendix b. at each @xmath53 we have @xmath150 thus the single - particle hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath46 has two @xmath151-fold degenerate levels @xmath152 where @xmath153 , so @xmath154 . the matrix corresponding to @xmath155 is block - diagonal with @xmath151 @xmath156-blocks @xmath157 and the matrix @xmath158 diagonalizes the @xmath159-blocks of @xmath46 . for @xmath68 and @xmath78",
