    "<S> let us consider the probability amplitude that the electron is scattered in the backward direction , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : abs](a ) . in this case , the final wave function , @xmath1 , is given by rotating the wave vector of the initial state , @xmath2 , by @xmath3 , so that we have the relationship between the initial state and final state as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a rotational operator with angle @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : path1 ] ) and ( [ eq : path2 ] ) , we get @xmath10 now , the total backward scattering amplitude is given by the sum of @xmath1 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 \\phi_{\\bf -k}$ ] . because the wave function gets an extra phase shift of @xmath3 ( called the berry s phase  @xcite ) through a rotation of the wave vector around the dirac point , that is , @xmath13 is equivalent to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , a `` time - reversal '' pair of backward scattered waves cancels with each other , i.e. , @xmath16  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this , absence of backward scattering mechanism provides us with a simple solution explaining the high mobility , and the existence of a singularity at the dirac point is essential to the nontrivial phase shift of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not obvious whether the wave functions realizing in graphene nanoribbons can acquire a nontrivial berry s phase or not . </S>",
    "<S> the eigen state near the edge is the standing wave resulting from the interference between an incident wave and the edge reflected wave . </S>",
    "<S> if the berry s phase for the standing wave is trivial , then the scatters , such as a potential disorder created by charge impurities , may give rise to backward scattering . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the mobility of a graphene nanoribbon decreases considerably than that of a carbon nanotube .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the present paper , we study the berry s phases of the standing waves near the zigzag and armchair edges , and their effects on the local density of states and the transport properties of graphene nanoribbons .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit ] , we consider the zigzag edge parallel to the @xmath21-axis , by which translational symmetry along the @xmath22-axis is broken . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the incident state with wave vector @xmath23 is elastically scattered by the zigzag edge , and the wave vector of the reflected state becomes @xmath24 . by contrast , the armchair edge parallel to the @xmath22-axis breaks translational symmetry along the @xmath21-axis , so that the wave vector of the reflected state is @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> since the brillouin zone ( bz ) is given by rotating the hexagonal lattice by 90@xmath26 , one can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit ] that for the incident state near the k point , the reflected state by the zigzag edge is also near the k point , while the reflected state by the armchair edge is near the k@xmath27 point . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the scattering by the zigzag edge is intravalley scattering , while that by the armchair edge is intervalley scattering .     </S>",
    "<S> coordinate system is fixed as shown . </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) the hexagon represents the first bz of graphene , and the corners of the hexagon are k and k@xmath27 points . ]    to begin with , let us consider the scattering problem for the zigzag edge . since the zigzag edge is not the source of intervalley scattering , we focus on only the electrons near the k point . the incident and reflected waves are represented by the bloch states . </S>",
    "<S> the bloch state in the conduction energy band is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the area of sample , @xmath0 is the momentum measured from the k point , and @xmath30 is the polar angle between the vector @xmath0 and the @xmath31-axis . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bloch function acquires a nontrivial berry s phase of @xmath3 by a rotation of the wave vector around the k point as @xmath32    the standing wave modes arise from the interference between the incident waves and the reflected waves . </S>",
    "<S> let the wave vector of the incident wave be @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> then the vector of the elastically reflected wave is given by @xmath34 , and the standing wave near the zigzag edge is written as @xmath35 where the phase @xmath36 should be determined in such a manner that @xmath37 [ @xmath38 satisfies the boundary condition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take the following boundary condition for the zigzag edge  @xcite , @xmath39 which describes a situation in which the b - atoms located slightly above the horizontal dashed line at @xmath40 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit ] are separated from the lower semi - infinite graphene for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary condition of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : phib0 ] ) is satisfied when @xmath42 , and the standing wave is written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the length of the zigzag edge , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath48 is determined by the normalization condition . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the standing wave of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : zigwfsum ] ) reproduces the result of tight - binding lattice model ( see appendix b of ref . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we examine the berry s phase of the standing wave . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the case @xmath49 for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s - sol ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a normal incident process to the zigzag edge [ @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for this process does not vanish as @xmath52 this standing wave includes a backward scattering amplitude , and the existence of the backward scattering amplitude indicates that the berry phase of the standing wave vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since @xmath53 , the berry s phase of the reflected state is given by @xmath8 as @xmath54 while that of the incident state is @xmath3 [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : berry- ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the berry s phase of @xmath3 for the incident state is canceled by the berry s phase of @xmath20 for the reflected state , and hence the berry s phase for the standing wave vanishes in total . </S>",
    "<S> the trivial berry s phase can be understood from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s - sol ] ) , in which the bloch function of the standing wave is real  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the standing wave near the armchair edge . </S>",
    "<S> the k and k@xmath27 points need to be considered simultaneously in the case of armchair edge since the armchair edge is the source of intervalley scattering . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the wave vector of the incident wave measured from the k point is @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the wave vector of the elastically reflected wave measured from the k@xmath27 point is given by @xmath55 , and the standing wave is written as @xmath56 it can be shown that the bloch state near the k@xmath27 point is given by @xmath57  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may write @xmath58 where @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 otherwise . the relative phase @xmath62 can be determined by the boundary condition for armchair edge . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath62 must be @xmath63 , which will be derived elsewhere .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite note that the bloch functions for the k and k@xmath27 points are the same . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the berry s phase of the standing wave near the armchair edge is given by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , we can expect that the absence of backward scattering mechanism is valid near the armchair edge . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the absence of backward scattering mechanism for the armchair edge is not identical to that discussed so far for carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the notion of a `` time - reversal pair '' of scattered waves in the original argument  @xcite should be replaced to a true time - reversal pair of scattered waves near the armchair edge . </S>",
    "<S> the time - reversal state of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : armwf ] ) is given by  @xcite @xmath64 a magnetic field breaks time - reversal symmetry , so that it invalidates the new absence of backward scattering mechanism and leads to weak anti - localization . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to point out that the berry s phase for the standing wave near the armchair edge is robust against an ordinary mass term , while it is not robust against a topological mass term  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of a nontrivial berry s phase is related to a singularity in parameter space  @xcite . here , we show the relationship between the singularity at the dirac point ( @xmath65 ) in the momentum space and the standing wave . for the zigzag edge </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 is a continuous variable , and therefore the spectrum with @xmath66 may cross the dirac singularity . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq .  ( [ eq : s - sol ] ) shows that the standing wave with @xmath67 does not exist , that is @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dirac singularity seems to be separated from the spectrum of the standing wave . to explore this point further </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a zigzag nanoribbon by introducing another zigzag edge at @xmath69 , in addition to the zigzag edge at @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the edge atoms at @xmath69 are b - atoms , which imposes the boundary condition on the wave function at @xmath70 as @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the constraint equation for @xmath23 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this equation provides the solutions of @xmath74 which was obtained by brey and fertig in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> [ the minus sign in front of @xmath31 is a matter of notation ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath73 must be a nonzero integer because the equation does not possess a solution when @xmath75 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sflow ] , we plot the solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : const ] ) for the cases @xmath76 and 2 . the solution for @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> is given by shifting the curve for @xmath78 by @xmath79 , and only the solution with @xmath80 shows an anomalous feature . </S>",
    "<S> the curve with @xmath80 approaches a point on the @xmath31-axis . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be checked by setting @xmath81 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : const ] ) with @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> it is appropriate to refer to this state with @xmath82 and @xmath66 as the critical state  @xcite because this state is neither the standing wave nor the edge state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that no curve crosses the dirac singularity is consistent to the absence of a nontrivial berry s phase for the standing wave . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , an electron can not approach the dirac singularity due to the presence of the zigzag edge . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , an energy gap appears in the spectrum of the standing wave . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum energy gap is determined by the critical state as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the boundary condition for the zigzag edge , the boundary condition for the armchair edge does not forbid an electronic state cross the dirac singularity point , and therefore the electron can pick up a nontrivial berry s phase .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 which are allowed by the boundary condition for a zigzag nanoribbon . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac singularity is not located on the curves , which shows that there is no singularity at the parameter space of the standing waves . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the corresponding spectral flow in the energy dispersion relation . ]    here , we consider pseudospin of the standing wave in order to examine the local density of states ( ldos ) near the zigzag edge . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudospin for an eigenstate @xmath86 is defined by the expectation value of pauli matrices as @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) where @xmath89 is a pseudospin density defined by @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary condition of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : phib0 ] ) means that the pseudospin density is polarized into the positive @xmath91-axis locally near the zigzag edge , that is , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , by putting @xmath94 into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s - sol ] ) , we see that the standing wave near the zigzag edge has amplitudes only on a - atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this polarization of the pseudospin causes an anomalous behavior to appear in the ldos near the zigzag edge . </S>",
    "<S> to show this , let us first review the ldos for a graphene without an edge . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that electrons are non - interacting , the bulk ldos is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath97 , which results from the dirac cone spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos near the zigzag edge can be calculated by using the standing wave given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : s - sol ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos has the form , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is defined as @xmath100 by performing the integral with respect to the angle @xmath6 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rfac ] ) , we obtain the analytical result for @xmath99 as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a bessel function of order @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos is symmetric with respect to @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk ldos in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ldos_bulk ] ) can be reproduced by setting @xmath105 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ldos ] ) since @xmath106 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pspin ] , we plot the ldos at @xmath107 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6[nm ] . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the ldos depends on the distance from the zigzag edge . at the edge , </S>",
    "<S> that is , at @xmath107 , since @xmath108 and @xmath109 , we see that @xmath110 , and the slope of @xmath111 is half of that of @xmath112 [ @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> this results from the fact that the amplitudes at one of two sublattice disappears near the zigzag edge ( due to the pseudospin polarization ) , and only the half of the amplitude in the unit cell can contribute to the ldos .     is due to the edge states . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pspin ] , in addition to the ldos due to the standing wave , we plot the ldos ( at @xmath114[nm ] ) due to the edge states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the edge states produce a peak at @xmath104 in the ldos . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos of the edge states is calculated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function of the edge state is given by  @xcite @xmath115 note that the edge states appear for @xmath116 and @xmath41 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sflow ] ) . since the energy eigenvalue of the edge state vanishes </S>",
    "<S> , the ldos for the edge states is written as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a phenomenological parameter representing energy uncertainty of the edge states , for which we assume @xmath119 mev . substituting @xmath120 with @xmath121 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rhoes ] ) , and performing the integral for @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath122 this result has been used in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pspin ] to plot the ldos of the edge states . note that @xmath123 decreases as @xmath124 , which is a slowly decreasing function compared with the exponential decaying wave function of the edge state . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that @xmath125 can be derived from the fact that @xmath126 does not depend on @xmath22 for a large value of @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a sum rule for the total ldos consisting of the edge states and the standing waves , in which the density above ( below ) the fermi energy at @xmath104 must be position independent . </S>",
    "<S> this argument also shows that the singular behavior of the ldos for the edge states at @xmath40 is a consequence of the wave function of the standing wave .    by examining the standing wave near the graphene edge , </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that the armchair edge preserves a non - trivial berry s phase as in the bulk of graphene , on the other hand , such a non - trivial phase is absent for the standing wave near the zigzag edge . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the indication of this result with respect to the transport in graphene nanoribbons . in the argument for the absence of the backward scattering given in the introduction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : abs ] ) , we find , by replacing @xmath2 with the standing wave @xmath128 , that the backscattering amplitude , @xmath129\\psi_{\\bf -k}$ ] , is enhanced for zigzag nanoribbons ( due to @xmath130 ) , while it still vanishes for armchair nanoribbons ( due to @xmath131 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can expect that the conductance of a zigzag nanoribbon is smaller than that of an armchair nanoribbon , if we assume only scatters with long - range potential . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations performed by areshkin _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and yamamoto _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite show indeed that long - range potentials are ineffective in causing backscattering in a perfect armchair nanoribbon . for narrow metallic armchair nanoribbons , </S>",
    "<S> the linear energy dispersion originating from the dirac point provides a nearly perfect conduction , and this nearly perfect conduction might relate to the nontrivial berry s phase since the linear energy dispersion picks up the dirac singularity . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the standing wave for the armchair edge is a short - length intervalley mode , that is , the electronic wave length of the standing wave is order of the lattice constant . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the wave function can be very sensitive to a short - range scattering potential , such as irregular edges  @xcite and lattice vacancies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an armchair nanoribbon has both advantages ( non - trivial berry s phase ) and disadvantages ( intervalley mode ) for the transport as well as that a zigzag nanoribbon has both advantages ( intravalley mode ) and disadvantages ( trivial berry s phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in a realistic situation , it is reasonable to consider that a nanoribbon does not exhibit an electronic conduction comparable to a metallic carbon nanotube .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems that recent tight - binding numerical studies show that the conductance of zigzag nanoribbons is more robust than that of armchair nanoribbons against edge disorders .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the numerical studies , the transport given by the electrons which are located very close to the fermi level is concerned . for zigzag nanoribbons , </S>",
    "<S> the propagating modes in each valley contain a single one - way excess channel ( the states on the curve of @xmath80 which are close to the critical state shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sflow ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this feature causes a perfectly conducting channel to appear in the disordered system for the case that impurities do not give rise to intervalley scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this feature also seems to cause a robust conducting channel to appear in the edge disordered system .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for our discussion of the backscattering in zigzag nanoribbons , we assume that the initial state with momentum @xmath31 accompanies the corresponding final state with @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is not satisfied for the single one - way excess channel , for which our discussion for the berry s phase is useless . </S>",
    "<S> the single one - way excess channel plays a dominant role in zigzag nanoribbons of the widths up to several nanometers for a limited energy window .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite our result for the berry s phase may be useful in discussing transport of zigzag nanoribbons of the widths more than 10 nm , for which we have several number of channels having the final state with @xmath132 .    </S>",
    "<S> our result may have a relationship to the formation of a transport gap observed for graphene nanoribbons .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite note that the standing wave near a realistic rough edge can be described as the sum of the standing waves for zigzag and armchair edges .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since the standing wave for zigzag edge is a long - length intravalley mode and that for armchair edge is a short - length intervalley one , their characters do not interfere with each other and can coexist in the standing wave near a rough edge . </S>",
    "<S> this is also indicative of that a small portion of zigzag edge in a rough edge eventually governs the long - length transport behavior of a nanoribbon , as is numerically simulated by several authors .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite indeed , gallagher _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and han _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite observed that the source - drain gap has a strong dependence on ribbon s length . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to recognize that there are two distinct localized states ; the edge states and localized states which consist of the standing waves . since the localization length of the former is on the order of lattice constant , it is difficult to consider that the transport behavior of nanoribbons of the widths larger than @xmath133 nm is dominated by the edge states .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in contrast , the latter is caused by the scatters , such as a potential disorder created by charge impurities , giving rise to backward scattering . since the latter consists of the standing waves , </S>",
    "<S> there is a possibility that the localization length is the order of the width of a ribbon . </S>",
    "<S> han _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite measured electron transport in lithographically fabricated nanoribbons of widths @xmath134 nm with rough edge on the order of nanometers , and confirmed that the size of a transport gap is inversely proportional to the ribbon width .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the berry s phase for the standing wave near the zigzag edge is trivial . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum parameter space for the standing wave near the zigzag edge does not include the dirac singularity , which is essential to the absence of a non - trivial berry s phase . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the absence of backward scattering mechanism that works well in a metallic carbon nanotube can not be used for a zigzag nanoribbon . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the dirac singularity in the momentum space of the standing wave results in the peak in the ldos due to the edge states . </S>",
    "<S> an observation of the ldos peak near the zigzag edge is a direct evidence of the absence of the dirac singularity in the parameter space of the standing wave . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a non - trivial berry s phase survives the reflection by the armchair edge . for the standing wave near the armchair edge </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the new absence of backward scattering mechanism in which a real time - reversal pair of backward scattered waves cancels with each other . </S>",
    "<S> this absence of the backward scattering mechanism for the armchair edge is not robust against a short - range scattering potential since the standing wave is a short - length intervalley mode . </S>",
    "<S> an armchair nanoribbon has both advantage and disadvantage for the transport as well as a zigzag nanoribbon . </S>"
