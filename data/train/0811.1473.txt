    "there are currently two models proposed for ultraluminous x  ray sources ( ulxs ) . in one",
    "they are identified as intermediate  mass black holes ( imbh ) accreting at rates below their eddington limits . in the alternative model ,",
    "ulxs represent a very bright and unusual phase of x  ray binary evolution , in which the compact object is fed mass at a rate @xmath7 well above the usual eddington value @xmath8 . in the picture proposed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) radiation pressure becomes important at the spherization radius @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the schwarzschild radius of the accreting black hole of mass @xmath11 ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; see also begelman et al .",
    ", 2006 ; poutanen et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "within this radius the disc remains close to the local radiation pressure limit .",
    "matter is therefore blown away so that the accretion rate decreases with disc radius as @xmath12 . as the disc wind has the local escape velocity at each radius , we see from mass conservation that the wind is dense near @xmath13 and tenuous near the inner disc edge , and there is a vacuum funnel along the central disc axis through which radiation escapes .    in this model the large apparent x ",
    "ray luminosity @xmath14  erg s@xmath15 results from two effects of super  eddington accretion ( begelman et al . , 2006 ; poutanen et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "first , the bolometric luminosity is larger than the usual eddington limit by a factor @xmath16 , which can be of order @xmath17 for the high mass transfer rates encountered at various stages of the evolution of a compact stellar  mass binary .",
    "second , the luminosity of a ulx is collimated by a beaming factor @xmath18 via scattering off the walls of the central funnel .",
    "( note that here and thoughout this paper , ` beaming ' simply means geometrical collimation , and not relativistic beaming . )",
    "these conditions could occur in a state of high mass transfer ( cf king , 2001 , rappaport et al . , 2005 ) or conceivably a transient outburst ( king , 2002 ) .",
    "in this picture one would expect on physical grounds that the eddington ratio @xmath19 should determine the beaming factor @xmath18 .",
    "however current modelling has not yet derived this connection , allowing a spurious extra degree of freedom in comparing this picture with observations .",
    "a clue here comes from the fact that bright ulxs have spectra consisting of a power law plus a soft ( @xmath20  kev ) excess which can be modelled as a blackbody .",
    "this is usually taken as a multicolour disc with the maximum disc temperature as the reference value , but the fitted temperature is not very different if the blackbody is assumed uniform . feng & kaaret ( 2007 ) show that the luminosity @xmath21 and temperature @xmath22 of the blackbody component vary as @xmath23 with @xmath24 in the ultraluminous source ngc 1313 x2 .",
    "kajava & poutanen ( 2008 , hereafter kp ) ) have recently extended this result to a sample of nine ulxs ( including ngc 1313 x2 ) which have a power law continuum with a soft excess .",
    "these are essentially all the sources with inferred luminosities permanently above @xmath25  erg s@xmath15 .",
    "strikingly , kp find that all of these soft  excess objects cluster around the line @xmath26 at all epochs ( see the right  hand panel of their figure 3 ) . here",
    "@xmath27 is the temperature in units of 0.1  kev .",
    "kp caution that the agreement for the coolest and brightest may be affected by an incorrect subtraction of the hard emission component , but the overall trend ( [ kp ] ) is clear .",
    "kp also identify a distinct class of ` non  power  law ' ( or thermal ) type ulxs whose _ medium energy _",
    "spectra are fitted by harder multicolour disc blackbodies with reference temperatures @xmath28  kev rather than power laws plus a soft excess .",
    "all have inferred luminosities permanently below @xmath29  erg s@xmath15 . they do not obey ( [ kp ] ) , but instead follow individual luminosity  temperature correlations @xmath30 , just like standard ( non  ulx ) black hole binaries ( gierliski & done 2004 ) .    at first sight , as kp remark , the correlation ( [ kp ] ) for the soft excesses of bright , power  law ulxs seems counterintuitive , as one might expect a blackbody to vary as @xmath31 .",
    "however this assumes that the characteristic radius @xmath32 of the blackbody remains fixed as other parameters vary , and indeed that the inferred @xmath33 is not affected by beaming , which could itself also vary systematically .",
    "i shall show here that in the picture of ulxs as super ",
    "eddington accretors suggested by begelman et al ( 2006 ) and poutanen et al . (",
    "2007 ) , the correlation @xmath34 is actually expected , and results from a tight relation between the beaming factor @xmath18 and the eddington ratio @xmath1 of the form @xmath35 . using the observed relation ( [ kp ] ) we find @xmath18 and @xmath36 as functions of the eddington ratio @xmath1 for a given inferred disc luminosity . with @xmath1 taking values giving only modest beaming factors",
    "@xmath3 we find that the accretors in ulxs with soft components all have stellar masses @xmath37 .",
    "i suggest also that the non  power  law ulxs obeying @xmath31 actually have black hole masses sufficiently high ( @xmath38 ) that they are _ sub_eddington .",
    "king & puchnarewicz ( 2002 ) developed a general formalism for treating blackbody emission from the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "they allowed for geometrical collimation of this emission , but assumed that this did not change the blackbody luminosity @xmath40 or temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this is true for example of radiation subject to scattering by nonrelativistic electrons .",
    "king & puchnarewicz s main result ( their eqn ( 5 ) ) is @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the blackbody luminosity an observer would infer from the observed flux by assuming that it is isotropic , even though in reality it is collimated by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is the ratio of the intrinsic luminosity to the eddington limit @xmath44 ( which can exceed unity by the factor @xmath45 mentioned above ) , @xmath46 is a factor allowing for deviations from spherical symmetry in the source ( e.g. that it is actually plane and inclined to the line of sight ) and @xmath47 is the blackbody radius in units of the schwarschild radius .",
    "the derivation of the relation ( [ puch ] ) is simple .",
    "we express the intrinsic ( pre  collimated ) blackbody luminosity as @xmath48 where one writes the radius as @xmath49 at the first step , and the mass @xmath50 as @xmath51 at the second . solving this equation for @xmath40 we find @xmath52 .",
    "an observer assuming that the flux is isotropic with the observed value , rather than collimated , now infers a total blackbody luminosity @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 which gives ( [ puch ] ) when the proportionality constants are included .",
    "king & puchnarewicz ( 2002 ) used ( [ puch ] ) to argue that any source exceeding the normalization on the rhs must either be super ",
    "eddington for its mass ( @xmath55 ) , or emit from a region much smaller than the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath56 ) , or emit anisotropically ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "ultrasoft quasars and some ulxs lie close to this regime on the @xmath58 plane . here , setting @xmath59 , we see that the @xmath60 correlation ( [ kp ] ) for ulx soft excesses is reproduced provided that @xmath61    observation thus strongly suggests that @xmath62 .",
    "if the power of @xmath22 in ( [ kp ] ) were not precisely 4 , e.g. the value @xmath63 found by feng & kaaret ( 2007 ) , this would introduce a @xmath22dependence into the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 . since the fitted value of @xmath22 varies by a factor @xmath66 , while ( as we shall see ) the inferred beaming factor @xmath18 varies much more , we would make only a small error in adopting the approximate dependence @xmath67 here too .",
    "this scaling of @xmath18 thus seems to be required by observation .",
    "theoretically , a simple argument suggests that a @xmath68 dependence follows from the picture of ulxs proposed by begelman et al ( 2006 ) and poutanen et al . , ( 2007 ) , in which a wind from the accretion disc surface keeps the local accretion rate at the radiation pressure limit at each disc radius , as originally suggested by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "the outflowing wind is densest near @xmath13 , and has large optical depth both outwards along the disc plane , and in the vertical direction .",
    "thus most of the disc radiation emitted within @xmath13 must diffuse inwards by scattering , until it escapes through the central funnels parallel to the disc axis .",
    "the collimation results from the fact that the funnel is tall and thin , and has scattering walls .    to apply the formalism leading to ( [ puch ] ) we identify the blackbody radius @xmath32 as @xmath69 , with @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "the blackbody luminosity emitted by the disc within @xmath13 is the intrinsic luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "this diffuses inwards and is collimated by the funnels .    for the beaming factor @xmath18",
    "we consider a simple cylindrical funnel around the central disc axis .",
    "if the typical cylindrical radius of the funnel is @xmath72 , and its height is @xmath73 , the half  angle over which radiation escapes is @xmath74 .",
    "then the beaming fraction @xmath18 is simply the total fractional area of the two funnels , i.e. @xmath75 . close to the disc plane , the structure of the central region of the disc wind ( and thus the funnel radius @xmath72 ) is independent of the value of eddington ratio @xmath76 at large @xmath32 , since all such discs have the same central accretion rate behaviour @xmath77 .",
    "we expect that @xmath78 with @xmath79 , as @xmath80 sets the lengthscales in this region .",
    "however the funnel height @xmath81 _ is _ sensitive to @xmath82 , or equivalently @xmath83 , as at points far from the disc plane the wind flow pattern is set by @xmath1 , which is equivalent to saying that the large  scale flow pattern is self  similar and scaled by @xmath64 .",
    "in particular this requires @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , so that finally @xmath86 where @xmath87 stands for the dimensionless combination @xmath88 we see the the observational requirement ( [ num ] ) implies @xmath89 , so that the funnel height is only a few percent of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath90 .",
    "we get finally @xmath91 the reasoning of this paragraph assumes that @xmath1 is large enough that the two scales @xmath72 and @xmath13 are very different .",
    "the scaling of @xmath18 with @xmath1 is clearly more complex for smaller @xmath1 . in particular , unless @xmath92 , which requires @xmath93 , one would formally get @xmath94 .",
    "the last section dealt with those ulxs ( the majority ) for which soft components are seen , and obey the @xmath34 relation .",
    "we noted above that kp show that the remaining ( non  power  law ) ulxs follow opposed correlations @xmath4 for the medium  energy x  rays . here",
    "the normalization differs for each individual system .",
    "the luminosities of the two groups differ sharply : the power  law  soft ",
    "excess systems have inferred luminosities permanently above @xmath95  ergs@xmath15 , while the non  power  law systems are permanently below @xmath96  ergs@xmath15 .",
    "it seems likely that these fainter systems correspond to _ sub_eddington accretion on to black holes with masses @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that such systems must exist , and that there is no reason to expect the collimation leading to the opposite @xmath98 behaviour of the bright ulxs .",
    "the normalizations of the @xmath4 correlations are then fixed by the system inclinations and the inner disc radii .",
    "the latter are indeed of order a few schwarzschild radii for black holes of @xmath38 .",
    "we can now check whether the inferred behaviour of the beaming factor leads to sensible parameters for observed bright ulxs .",
    "although the relation ( [ beam ] ) for @xmath18 was derived using the inferred blackbody disc emission , its geometrical nature and the fact that electron scattering is independent of photon energy makes it probable that it holds for all forms of ulx luminosity , and indeed even in ulxs where no blackbody disc component has been identified , provided only that these correspond to super ",
    "eddington accretion .",
    "in particular we can use the @xmath99 scaling in considering medium  energy x ",
    "rays , which are generally assumed to carry most of the bolometric luminosity of a ulx .",
    "the effect of beaming is to cause an observer to infer a spherical luminosity    @xmath100    ( cf shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; begelman et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "eliminating @xmath18 using ( [ b ] ) ( or ( [ num ] ) gives @xmath101 we can re  express this as @xmath102 where @xmath103  ergs@xmath15 .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath104 and @xmath18 as functions of @xmath1 ( using equations [ mass ] and [ beam ] ) .",
    "we see that eddington ratios in the range @xmath105 imply stellar masses @xmath106 for the accretors if the disc luminosity is @xmath107  erg s@xmath15 , and beaming factors in the range @xmath108 .",
    "hence stellar  mass binaries with moderate eddington ratios and consequently modest beaming provide very good candidates for explaining ulxs .",
    "we note from ( [ lum ] ) that the inferred luminosity @xmath109 varies essentially only because of the sensitivity of the beaming factor @xmath18 to @xmath1 .",
    "thus the bolometric luminosity varies only logarithmically above @xmath44 ( assuming that the eddington ratio always exceeds unity ) , but is spread over a smaller or greater solid angle as @xmath1 increases or decreases , significantly altering the inferred luminosity .    since @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , the radiative efficiency , is similar ( @xmath112 ) for black holes and neutron stars ,",
    "i note that that some ulxs could contain neutron stars , and could even have lower absolute accretion rates for the same inferred luminosity . from fig .",
    "1 we see that a @xmath113 black hole with @xmath114 and a neutron star with mass @xmath115 and @xmath116 produce similar inferred luminosities , with the neutron  star system having an absolute accretion rate @xmath7 lower by a factor @xmath117 than the black hole .",
    "the origin of this apparently paradox is that the latter system has a smaller beaming factor .",
    "( put another way , on fig .",
    "1 the curves of constant @xmath7 are hyperbolae which cross the hyperbola describing @xmath18 . ) for ultrasoft ulxs with no detectable medium  energy x  ray component , even white dwarf accretors are possible , particularly since for them @xmath111 can be enhanced over the pure accretion yield by nuclear burning of the accreting matter ( cf fabbiano et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "population studies of ulxs have until now faced the difficulty that the beaming factor @xmath18 was not determined , introducing a spurious degree of freedom . given the connection ( [ beam ] )",
    ", we can now remove this .",
    "we consider a population of ulxs with host galaxy space density @xmath118  mpc@xmath119 and assume that each host contains @xmath120 ulxs , with radiation beams oriented randomly . to be in the beam of one such object one has to search through @xmath121 galaxies , i.e. a space volume @xmath122 .",
    "the nearest observed ulx is thus at a distance @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the apparent luminosity of the ulx is @xmath125 where @xmath126 , giving a maximum apparent bolometric flux @xmath127 these relations , together with the results of the previous section , agree with the fact that ulxs of apparent luminosity few  @xmath128  erg s@xmath15 are observed in the local group , and suggest that the typical intrinsic number @xmath120 per host galaxy is at most a few .",
    "this is in line with estimates of the numbers of high  mass x ",
    "ray binaries in phases of rapid mass transfer on thermal or nuclear timescales ( king et al . , 2001 ; rappaport et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that these systems offer good candidates for explaining most if not all ulxs .",
    "ultimately one needs a population synthesis calculation to verify that this picture produces the right numbers of systems with the required moderate eddington ratios to produce the nearby ulxs .",
    "it is unclear to what value of @xmath1 one may safely extrapolate the @xmath99 dependence inferred here .",
    "this is an interesting question , as we know ( cf begelman et al , 2006 ; king & begelman , 1999 ) that the well  studied object ss433 has @xmath129 .",
    "such values are typical for both thermal  timescale and nuclear  timescale mass transfer from massive donor stars ( rappaport et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "from the work of the previous section , now scaling @xmath1 as @xmath130 , the nearest such object would be at a distance @xmath131 where i have taken @xmath132  mpc@xmath119 as appropriate for @xmath133 galaxies .",
    "the apparent isotropic luminosity of such an object would be @xmath134 hence in distance and apparent luminosity the object would appear as an agn .",
    "however , unlike a genuine agn , there is no requirement that it should lie precisely in the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "a possible candidate for such an object is the bl lac system pks  1413 + 135 ( perlman et al . , 2002 ) . with redshift @xmath135",
    "it has distance @xmath136  mpc and isotropic luminosity @xmath137 , but lies at @xmath138  mas from the centre of the host galaxy .",
    "the work of this paper suggests that the beaming factor in super ",
    "eddington accretion varies as @xmath99 .",
    "this seems to be required by observations of the @xmath139 correlation , and is reasonable on general geometrical grounds .",
    "the existence of this scaling means that observable properties of ulxs depend essentially only on the eddington ratio @xmath1 .",
    "if this conclusion is valid , this removes the spurious degree of freedom allowing one to choose @xmath18 independently of @xmath1 which has made systematic parameter estimates difficult in the past ( e.g. king , 2008 , where these two quantities are not connected ) .",
    "it appears that most ulxs correspond to stellar mass systems accreting at eddington ratios of order 10  30 , with corresponding beaming factors @xmath3 .",
    "high  mass x ",
    "ray binaries containing black holes or neutron stars are excellent candidates , although population synthesis studies are needed to check this .",
    "the scaling inferred here suggests that ulxs vary mainly because the beaming factor is sensitive to the eddington ratio .",
    "if the scaling can be extrapolated to the eddington ratios found in ss433 , some objects currently identified as agn at modest redshifts might actually be ulxs .",
    "this may explain cases where the agn does not coincide with the centre of the host galaxy .",
