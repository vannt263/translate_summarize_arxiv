    ", we also consider @xmath0-differentials , that is differentials of the form @xmath3 .",
    "nonzero @xmath0-differentials define flat metrics as well but their holonomy can be nontrivial ( rotations of angle @xmath4).zeroes of arbitrary order and poles of order at most @xmath5 of a meromorphic @xmath0-differential are the conical singularities of the flat metric induced",
    ". poles of order at least @xmath0 are referred to as _ poles of higher order_. every neighborhood of a pole of higher order is of infinite area for the induced flat structure . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on saddle connections of flat surfaces with poles of higher order .",
    "a saddle connection is a geodesic segment joining two conical singularities and having no singularity inside it .",
    "translation surfaces ( corresponding to holomorphic @xmath2-forms ) and half - translation surfaces ( corresponding to meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles ) have been deeply studied , both from a geometrical and a dynamical point of view , see @xcite .",
    "they are flat surfaces of finite area.some surfaces of infinite area , such as the infinite staircase , have already been studied from a dynamical perspective , see @xcite .",
    "they are surfaces of infinite genus and their dynamics is very rich . however , our work is totally different .",
    "flat surfaces that correspond to meromorphic @xmath0-differentials have finite genus and their interest is much more geometric than dynamic .",
    "they have been connected with at least three different fields of study:- wall - crossing structures in spaces of stability conditions on triangulated categories,- spectral families of linear differential operators,- compactifications of strata of differentials corresponding to surfaces of finite area .",
    "one of the main motivations in the recent growth in interest for the study of spaces of meromorphic differentials is the connection with spaces of stability conditions on certain triangulated categories drawn in the paper of bridgeland and smith @xcite .",
    "they provide a way to construct a calabi - yau category of dimension three ( @xmath6 ) starting from a triangulated surface .",
    "there is a correspondance between quadratic differentials on the surface and stability conditions of the category .",
    "saddle connections of a quadratic differential are interpreted as stable objects of a category for a given stability condition.the study of spaces of stability conditions has physical motivations .",
    "donaldson - thomas invariants of calabi - yau threefolds can serve as counting functions of bps states in string theory .",
    "donaldson - thomas invariants depend on the choice of a stability condition but are constant under small enough deformations .",
    "they can change at real codimension one hypersurfaces of the space of stability conditions ( walls ) .",
    "wall - crossing formulas relate the values of the invariants on both sides of a wall , see the works of gaiotto - moore - neitzke and kontsevich - soibelman @xcite .",
    "donaldson - thomas invariants have been generalized from calabi - yau threefolds to the more general calabi - yau categories of dimension three ( @xmath6).saddle connections of flat surfaces are related to donaldson - thomas invariants and exhibit a wall - crossing phenomenon . as shown in the following , there is a walls - and - chambers structure in strata of differentials with poles of higher order .",
    "there is no such thing in strata of differentials corresponding to flat surfaces of finite area .",
    "the moduli spaces of these two kinds of objects have quite different geometric properties and are involved in distinct settings .",
    "differentials are also related to the asymptotic theory of various linear differential operators . according to a conjecture of boris shapiro @xcite ,",
    "each saddle connection of a meromorphic quadratic differential @xmath7 corresponds to an infinite series of eigenvalues for the wkb approximation of the schrdinger equation @xmath8.differentials of higher order , that is @xmath0-differentials for which @xmath9 , also appear in the study of the asymptotic root distribution for the eigenpolynomials of higher lam operators , see @xcite . in particular",
    ", shapiro developed a notion of jenkins - strebel differentials of higher order . if @xmath1 , a jenkins - strebel differential is a differential that induces a flat structure such that almost every horizontal trajectory is closed .",
    "recent results of eskin - mirzakhani - mohammadi and filip have shown that @xmath10-orbit closures of translation surfaces are quasiprojective subvarities of the ambient stratum , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of projective subvarieties of compactifications of strata can lead to further progress in the classification of orbit closures .",
    "meromorphic differentials naturally occur in compactifications of strata of abelian and quadratic differentials as possible degenerations @xcite .",
    "counting saddle connections of flat surfaces is a problem that could be very different depending if there are poles of higher order , see @xcite",
    ". translation surfaces ( corresponding to holomorphic @xmath2-forms ) and half - translation surfaces ( corresponding to meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles ) always have an infinite number of saddle connections . providing an asymptotic description of the set of saddle connections of such surfaces",
    "is an important part of the study of flat surfaces .",
    "let @xmath11 be a ( half-)translation surface of area equal to one .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the number of saddle connections of @xmath11 of length at most @xmath13 .",
    "it was proved by masur in @xcite that there exist constants @xmath14 such that for @xmath13 sufficiently large , we have:@xmath15 if we consider almost all flat surfaces of a connected component @xmath16 of a stratum @xmath17 , we get an exact asymptotic description of the number of saddle connections .",
    "it was proved by eskin and masur in @xcite that there is a siegel - veech constant @xmath18 such that for almost every ( half-)translation surface @xmath11 in @xmath16 , we have @xmath19 .",
    "when there are poles of higher order , strata do not display such uniformity . as will be described further in this paper , in many strata",
    "there are domains where surfaces have a finite number of saddle connections and domains where surfaces have an infinite number of them . for domains where surfaces have a finite number of saddle connections ,",
    "this number is not necessarily the same throughout the stratum .",
    "this lack of uniformity can be explained largely by the existence of a walls - and - chambers structure in those strata .",
    "there is a natural notion of discriminant in every stratum that allows to define walls ( hypersurfaces of real codimension one ) and chambers ( connected components of the complement to the discriminant of the stratum ) .",
    "many numbers related to saddle connections are constant in chambers but change as we cross a wall .",
    "this is especially true for the maximal number of saddle connections we can draw on the surface in such a way that two distinct saddle connections intersect at most in the endpoints.if @xmath1 , there is a natural action of @xmath10 on the stratum .",
    "this action is ergodic on strata of abelian differentials or strata of quadratic differentials with at most simple poles .",
    "because of the walls - and - chambers structure , the action of @xmath10 on strata of differentials with poles of higher order is almost never ergodic .",
    "this partly explains the great variety of behaviors we can find in a stratum of differentials with poles of higher order .    in this paper",
    ", we initiate the study of the counting problem in the case of strata of @xmath0-differentials with poles of higher order .",
    "our objective is twofold .",
    "first , we try to solve the problem as completely as possible for meromorphic @xmath2-forms and meromorphic quadratic differentials .",
    "as it turns out , many of our results equally hold for differentials of higher order and may be used as foundational results for a further study .",
    "let @xmath11 be a compact riemann surface .",
    "@xmath20 is the canonical line bundle on @xmath11 .",
    "a meromorphic @xmath0-differential @xmath21 is a meromorphic section of @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath21 has at least one pole of order at least @xmath0 , then @xmath23 is called a _ flat surface with poles of higher order_. when",
    "there is no ambiguity , it will be referred to as @xmath11 .",
    "flat surfaces with poles of higher order are infinite area surfaces with `` finite complexity '' @xcite.in the following , without further specification , we study differentials with at least one pole of order at least @xmath0 . if @xmath24 , we get translation surfaces with poles studied in @xcite .",
    "zeroes and poles of order at most @xmath5 of the @xmath0-differential are conical singularities for the induced flat metric @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the stratum in the moduli space of meromorphic @xmath0-differentials that correspond to differentials with conical singularites of degrees @xmath26 and poles of degrees @xmath27 .",
    "family @xmath28 is the _ singularity pattern _ of the stratum .",
    "the integer @xmath29 such that @xmath30 is the _ genus _ of the flat surface with poles of higher order .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , we will assume that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "besides , if @xmath33 , we will assume that @xmath34 because there is no saddle connections in surfaces with too few singularities . in order to simplify our study , there are no marked points in the surfaces we study .    in this paper , we prove several theorems about the number of saddle connections of flat surfaces with poles of higher order .",
    "we beforehand introduce some new tools in order to establish these results .",
    "the _ core _ of a flat surface with poles of higher order @xmath23 is the convex hull @xmath35 of the set of conical singularities of the @xmath0-differential for the locally euclidian metric , see the work of haiden - katzarkov - kontsevich for the case of meromorphic quadratic differentials @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath36 as the interior of @xmath35 in @xmath11 and @xmath37 as its boundary , see definition 4.1 for more details .",
    "the following lemma shows that @xmath35 separates poles of higher order from each other .",
    "we define the _ domain of a pole @xmath38 _ as the connected component of @xmath39 containing the pole of higher order @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a flat surface with @xmath40 poles of higher order , then @xmath41 has @xmath40 connected components .",
    "each of them is a topological disk that contains a unique pole of higher order .",
    "the _ core _ is said to be degenerated when @xmath42 , that is when @xmath35 coincides with graph @xmath43 . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , there is a natural action of @xmath10 on strata that provides a systematic way to construct flat surfaces whose core is degenerated .",
    "there are such surfaces in the @xmath10-orbit closure of every surface , see lemma 2.2 .",
    "it must be noted there is no natural action of @xmath10 on strata of @xmath0-differentials for which @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a flat surface with poles of higher order such that @xmath21 is a @xmath2-form or a quadratic differential .",
    "then , there is a surface @xmath44 in the @xmath10-orbit closure of @xmath23 inside the ambiant stratum such that all saddle connections of @xmath44 share the same direction and @xmath45 is degenerated .",
    "structure changes of the core define a walls - and - chambers structure on the strata ( see definition 4.10 ) .",
    "in other words , there is a _ discriminant _",
    "@xmath46 that is a hypersurface of real codimension one .",
    "_ chambers _ are the connected components of the complement to the discriminant .",
    "every topological property of the core is invariant in chambers ( see proposition 4.13 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , this walls - and - chambers structure is @xmath10-invariant .",
    "lemma 2.1 is proved in section 4 .",
    "lemma 2.2 is proved in section 5 .      the existence of a walls - and - chambers structure is not the only difference with usual flat surfaces of finite area .",
    "dynamics of flat surfaces with poles of higher order are also different from the usual case because most trajectories go to infinity , that is to a pole of higher order .    for every flat surface corresponding to a @xmath0-differential there is a canonical covering of degree @xmath0 by a translation surface .",
    "this construction typically introduced in the context of quadratic differentials with at most simple poles works with poles of higher order as well as with @xmath0-differential for arbitrary @xmath0 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , every result about the dynamics of the vertical flow for meromorphic @xmath2-forms can be transfered to flat surfaces with nontrivial holonomy .",
    "our first theorem is a classification of invariant components for the directional flow of translation surfaces with poles ( corresponding to meromorphic @xmath2-forms ) .",
    "its counterpart for classical translation surfaces only features cylinders and minimal components .",
    "the picture is a little more complicated for translation surface with poles .",
    "let @xmath47 be a translation surface with poles ( @xmath48 is a meromorphic @xmath2-form ) .",
    "cutting along all saddle connections sharing a given direction @xmath49 , we obtain finitely many connected components called _ invariant components_. there are four types of invariant components : - * finite volume cylinders * where the leaves are periodic with the same period , - * minimal components * of finite volume where the foliation is minimal , the directions are recurrent and whose dynamics are given by a nontrivial interval exchange map , - * infinite volume cylinders * bounding a simple pole and where the leaves are periodic with the same period , - * free components * of infinite volume where generic leaves go from a pole to another or return to the same pole.finite volume components belong to @xmath35.the number of infinite volume cylinders is bounded by the number of simple poles.the number of free components is bounded by the total number of poles .",
    "types of trajectories are the same regardess the order of the differential . in particular ,",
    "regular closed geodesics describe cylinders for flat structures defined by @xmath0-differentials .",
    "the aim is to show that existence of a finite volume cylinder is a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface to have an infinite number of saddle connections .",
    "the theorem below shows that existence of finite volume cylinders or minimal components corresponds to infinity of saddle connections .",
    "there is a similar result in the context of slit translation surfaces in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be a flat surface with poles of higher order .",
    "then the directions of the waist curves of finite volume cylinders and the directions of minimal components of @xmath23 are exactly the accumulation points of directions of saddle connections of @xmath23 considered as points of the unit circle ( up to a rotation of angle @xmath50 ) .",
    "combining the previous result with a theorem of @xcite , we get a very simple characterization of surfaces with infinitely many saddle connections .",
    "a flat surface with poles of higher order @xmath23 of a stratum @xmath17 has infinitely many saddle connections if and only if there is a finite volume cylinder in @xmath11 . besides , the locus in the stratum @xmath17 where @xmath51 is an open set .",
    "the previous corollary opens the way to a combinatorial characterization of the strata where we can find infinity of saddle connection for at least one surface .",
    "we provide such a characterization for strata of @xmath2-forms and strata of quadratic differentials in section 8 .",
    "theorems 2.3 to 2.4 and corollary 2.5 are proved in section 5 .      in order to get topological constraints on the number of saddle connections",
    ", we introduce another concept from @xcite.a _ geodesic arc system _ is a graph of noncrossing saddle connections , see definition 4.5 .",
    "it is maximal if it can not be complemented with another saddle connection without crossing the others .",
    "since it is possible for @xmath0-differentials with @xmath9 to exhibit saddle connections that intersect themselves , we consider only saddle connections without self-intersection.two maximal geodesic arc systems of a given surface have the same number of edges ( lemma 6.1 ) so we indistinctly use the terms `` number of noncrossing saddle connections '' and `` number of edges of maximal geodesic arc systems''.the number @xmath52 of edges of a maximal geodesic arc system of a flat surface @xmath23 is a minorant of the number of saddle connections of @xmath23 but is much easier to compute .",
    "in particular , every maximal geodesic arc system on a flat surface @xmath23 defines an ideal triangulation of @xmath35 , see lemma 4.6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath53 the number of ideal triangles in every triangulation of @xmath35 .",
    "we have @xmath54 , see lemma 4.8 .",
    "therefore , the number @xmath52 remains constant along each chamber.the following theorem provides lower bounds both on the number @xmath55 of saddle connections and the maximal number @xmath52 of noncrossing saddle connections .",
    "the bound is proved to be sharp in strata of @xmath2-forms and strata of quadratic differentials .",
    "in particular , this means that in the case @xmath1 , there are flat surfaces with a finite number of saddle connections in every stratum . on the contrary , for every @xmath9 , there are strata such that there is no flat surface whose core is degenerated .",
    "let @xmath52 be the number of edges of a maximal geodesic arc system for a flat surface with poles of higher order @xmath23 of genus @xmath29 belonging to @xmath25 , then : @xmath56 @xmath57 if and only if @xmath35 is degenerated .",
    "provided @xmath1 , there are such surfaces in the closure of every chamber in the ambiant stratum .",
    "following theorem 2.6 , the lower bound for @xmath52 and @xmath55 may be attained only on very singular surfaces .",
    "theorem 2.7 shows that staying away from the discriminant @xmath46 we may obtain different lower bounds for @xmath52 .",
    "we consider the specific example of @xmath0-differentials whose poles of higher order are all of order @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the number of edges of a maximal geodesic arc system for a flat surface with poles of higher order @xmath23 of genus @xmath29 belonging to @xmath58 , then:- if @xmath0 is odd , we have @xmath59,- if @xmath0 is even and @xmath60 , we have @xmath59,- if @xmath0 is even and @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 .",
    "proving an upper bound on the maximal number of noncrossing saddle connections requires some calculations involving the angular contributions of the domains of poles of higher order .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the upper bound does not depend on the degree of zeroes and poles but only on their number .",
    "let @xmath52 be the number of edges of a maximal geodesic arc system for a flat surface with poles of higher order @xmath23 of genus @xmath29 that belongs to @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .",
    "theorem 2.6 to 2.8 are proved in section 6 .",
    "the problem of infinity of saddle connections is first adressed at the level of chambers . in theorem 2.9",
    ", we prove a dichotomy between chambers where some surfaces have an infinite number of saddle connections and chambers where the number of saddle connections is globally bounded .",
    "in particular , the following theorem forbids existence of a chamber where every surface would have a finite number of saddle connections but where this number could be arbitrarily large .",
    "theorem 2.9 is only about strata of @xmath2-forms . since closed geodesics are very different if @xmath9 , a generalization of this theorem would require deeper insights .",
    "such a theorem would be easier in the case @xmath65 but we would need better combinatorial information about the core in order to get a sharp bound .",
    "just as in theorems 2.6 and 2.8 , we crucially use the triangulation defined by a maximal geodesic arc system to get an upper bound . for a given flat surface @xmath23 , the number @xmath53 of ideal triangles in a triangulation of @xmath35 is constant in the chamber",
    "@xmath23 belongs to , see lemma 4.8 . besides , the numbers @xmath66 of ideal triangles in every connected component of the interior of @xmath35 are also constant in the chamber .",
    "we have @xmath67 .",
    "for every stratum @xmath68 of flat surfaces of genus @xmath29 and for every chamber @xmath16 , exactly one of these two statements is true:- @xmath16 is a _ chamber of bounded type _ : for every surface @xmath23 in chamber @xmath16 , we have @xmath69.- @xmath16 is a _ chamber of unbounded type _ : there is a surface @xmath23 in chamber @xmath16 such that @xmath51 .    since there are @xmath70 geodesic segments in a convex flat @xmath71-gon , we can construct translation surfaces with poles ( in the case @xmath24 ) whose core is a convex flat @xmath71-gon and that realize the case of equality of the bound , see proposition 7.1 .",
    "therefore , our bound is sharp in a certain way .",
    "following theorem 2.8 , we get @xmath72 so we can easily convert our bound that depends on @xmath53 into a global bound that depends only on the singularity pattern of the stratum ( numbers @xmath73 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "chambers are defined as domains of strata where the core has the same topological structure so there should be a topological characterization of chambers of unbounded type .",
    "however , it is still an open problem .",
    "theorem 2.9 is proved in section 7 .      in a ( half-)translation surface , closed",
    "geodesics are simple curves .",
    "it is just the opposite of the case @xmath9 where generic closed geodesics may have self - intersection .",
    "therefore , in the case @xmath1 , cutting along a family of closed geodesics decomposes a surface into especially nice components connected by cylinders .",
    "such a decomposition defines what we denote by a _ graph representation _ , that is a graph where vertices correspond to components and edges correspond to cylinders .",
    "every singularity of the singularity pattern @xmath28 of a stratum @xmath25 is assigned to a vertex , see figure 1 .     and a flat realization . ]",
    "we define for every stratum of @xmath2-forms or quadratic differentials its _ reducibility index _ @xmath74 .",
    "this number quantifies to what extent the combinatorics of singularity pattern @xmath28 of stratum @xmath25 allows the surfaces to be decomposed into several components connected by cylinders .",
    "our goal is to making explicit the combinatorial obstruction for surfaces of a given stratum to include a finite volume cylinder , that is to have an infinite number of saddle connections . in theorem 2.12",
    ", we prove that the only obstruction is combinatorial .",
    "it allows us to provide a complete characterization of strata such that every flat surface has a finite number of saddle connections .    what follows in this section applies to flat surfaces with or without poles of higher provided .",
    "the only condition is that the differential must be a @xmath2-form or a quadratic differential .",
    "we have to be careful .",
