    "recent years have seen rapid progress in computing higher - order corrections to the standard model . in particular , there have been a large number of new computations of two - loop scattering amplitudes with more than a single kinematic variable ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ) . in the past decades",
    ", a number of new approaches have been developed to cope with this complexity , including helicity methods , color decompositions , recursion relations , ideas based on string theory , and the unitarity - based method , summarized in a variety of review articles  @xcite .",
    "much of the progress at two loops has been facilitated by new techniques for performing loop integrals ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "splitting amplitudes describe the universal singular behavior of amplitudes in the regions of phase space where momenta become collinear . in this",
    "talk we summarize the calculation of @xmath0 splitting amplitudes at two loops via the unitarity sewing method  @xcite .",
    "the two - loop splitting amplitudes , including the ones involving quarks , have also been extracted recently from explicit computations of four - point helicity amplitudes with a massive leg  @xcite . with the unitarity sewing method",
    "the simple factorization properties of light - cone gauge are retained , but the need for principal value or other such prescriptions  @xcite is avoided .",
    "we also discuss a variety of applications of two - loop splitting amplitudes .",
    "these include verifying amplitude calculations  @xcite or constructing anstze  @xcite for amplitudes with more than two kinematic variables .",
    "splitting amplitudes also enter into an alternative method  @xcite for computing corrections to the dglap kernel governing the @xmath1 evolution of parton distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "we have also used them in a proof  @xcite of catani s formula  @xcite for universal two - loop infrared divergences , complementing the proof based on resummation  @xcite .",
    "they have also been used to provide direct evidence that in maximally supersymmetric @xmath2 super - yang - mills theory , higher - loop planar amplitudes can be expressed in terms of lower - loop ones , suggesting that substantial portions of the theory may be solvable .",
    "2.9 truein",
    "-.7 cm    -.3 cm    for simplicity , here we consider only the leading color contributions .",
    "the full color structure of the two - loop splitting amplitudes may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . at @xmath3 loops",
    "the behavior of the leading - color contributions are given by  @xcite @xmath4 in the limit where the momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is an @xmath9-loop splitting amplitude .",
    "legs @xmath10 and @xmath11 carry helicities @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while the merged leg @xmath14 carries helicity @xmath15 , runs over the two helicities of the intermediate state . in the other sum , @xmath9 runs over the loop order . as a simple example",
    ", the collinear factorization of an @xmath16-point tree amplitude into a splitting amplitude and an @xmath17-point amplitude is depicted schematically in .",
    ".9 truein    -.8",
    "cm    -.3 cm [ treethreevertexfigure ]    at tree level , the splitting amplitudes are rather straightforward to obtain by evaluating diagrams . the splitting amplitude depicted in may be computed directly from the feynman three - vertex depicted in by multiplying by the off - shell propagator and saturating the external legs with helicity states  @xcite .    beyond tree level",
    "the analogous computation is more subtle . in covariant gauges",
    "there are additional ` non - factorizing ' contributions associated with soft - gluon emission , complicating the analysis  @xcite .",
    "one might be tempted to avoid this difficulty by using instead physical gauges such as light - cone gauge since they have simple factorization properties .",
    "unfortunately , light - cone gauge has another set of complications arising from the propagator , @xmath18 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the particle momentum , @xmath20 is the minkowski metric , and @xmath16 is a null vector ( @xmath21 ) defining the light - cone direction .",
    "the problem occurs in the region where @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "one common method for dealing with this singularity is the principal - value prescription which replaces @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a regulator parameter .",
    "another choice , better founded in field theory , is the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of any of these prescriptions in a splitting amplitude calculation is problematic for a number of reasons .",
    "the most serious problem is that results retain dependence on the regulator parameter @xmath24 .",
    "( in general these cancel only after combining virtual and real emission contributions . ) a calculation of the splitting amplitudes that retains this dependence can not match the splitting amplitudes extracted from the collinear limits of scattering amplitudes which are independent of such a parameter . thus one would not obtain the desired results .",
    "1.8 truein    -.9",
    "cm    -.5 cm    is the need for these prescriptions is an artifact of the gauge choice ? could they be avoided in a more physical construction of the splitting amplitudes ? yes ! as a concrete example , consider the two integrals in . in a light - cone gauge calculation of the one - loop @xmath25 splitting",
    "amplitudes both integrals appear .",
    "what distinguishes these two integrals ?",
    "the key is the unitarity cut shown in . on the left - hand - side of the cut is an on - shell gauge invariant amplitude which does not contain light - cone denominators .",
    "this leads one to suspect that the integral in ( a ) is spurious and should not appear .",
    "on the other hand , the light - cone denominator in integral ( b ) does appear in the physical state projectors of the unitarity cut suggesting that it can not be removed .",
    "integral ( b ) , however , is perfectly well defined using dimensional regularization and is therefore harmless .",
    "1.5 truein    -.8 cm    -.4 cm",
    "to avoid the appearance of ill - defined integrals we use the unitarity sewing method  @xcite . with this method",
    "the loop integrands are obtained algorithmically by constructing unrestricted loop momentum integrals with the correct cuts in all channels .",
    "the method is well - tested , having been applied to a variety of problems .",
    "for example it has been used to obtain analytic formulas for @xmath26 partons at one loop  @xcite and one - loop maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external legs in supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "more relevant for the discussion here , it has also been used to obtain one - loop splitting amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "-.7 cm    the two - loop splitting amplitudes for @xmath27 were constructed by combining the three contributing unitarity cuts shown in into a single integrand  @xcite .",
    "one simplifying feature of the @xmath0 splitting amplitudes is that the non - planar configurations do not contribute , because of color considerations .",
    "the resulting integrand was then evaluated in terms of 13 master integrals using the implementation of the laporta algorithm  @xcite due to anastasiou and lazopoulos  @xcite .",
    "the master integrals were computed by constructing and solving a set of differential equations , along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite .    the results for the two - loop qcd splitting amplitudes are too lengthy to include here , but are given in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite where they are expressed in terms in terms of a series expansion in @xmath28 , with each term containing ordinary logarithms and polylogarithms .",
    "the two - loop results for @xmath2 super - yang - mills theory have an especially intriguing feature . to expose this , it is convenient to first write the loop splitting amplitudes in terms of a ratio with the corresponding tree functions , @xmath29 where @xmath3 indicates the loop order .",
    "rather surprisingly the two - loop ratios are expressible in terms of the one - loop ratios  @xcite , @xmath30 the explicit values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 may be found in refs .",
    "this relation between the two - loop and one - loop splitting amplitudes may provide a hint to unraveling the theory .",
    "one use of splitting amplitudes is to provide checks on calculations of amplitudes with more than two kinematic invariants from the collinear constraints  @xcite . at two loops the @xmath0 amplitudes are consistent with the collinear limits of the two - loop @xmath34 helicity",
    "amplitudes  @xcite . in some cases the collinear constraints are sufficient for constructing anstze for @xmath16-point scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that after subtracting the divergences from an amplitude , the finite remainders also satisfy universal collinear constraints  @xcite , providing a direct check on these terms .",
    "another application of the two - loop splitting amplitudes is for a proof of catani s formula  @xcite for two - loop infrared divergences  @xcite .",
    "the proof is based on taking collinear limit of the @xmath16-point formula , and comparing it with the @xmath17-point formula .",
    "the proof does require the reasonable assumption that terms do not vanish in all collinear limits .",
    "this proof is complementary to the one based on resummation  @xcite , since it fixes the explicit form of the functions appearing in catani s formula , including the previously unknown @xmath16-point color non - trivial terms at order @xmath35 .",
    "the two - loop splitting amplitudes are also one of the ingredients to an alternative approach  @xcite to computing the dglap kernels at nnlo .",
    "these kernels have recently been computed by moch , vermaseren and vogt  @xcite using the mellin space approach of computing anomalous dimensions of leading - twist operators .",
    "the computation of these kernels are of great importance for precision extraction of parton distribution functions from experimental data . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the splitting amplitudes can straightforwardly be continued to the space - like region relevant for the evolution of parton distribution functions .",
    "a more theoretical application of splitting amplitudes is for investigating the form of the multi - loop scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "it has been 30 years since t  hooft suggested that qcd could be solved in the planar limit .",
    "unfortunately , this has not been achieved as yet , so a logical approach is to start with a simpler theory .",
    "the structure of maximally supersymmetric @xmath2 yang - mills theory is much simpler than qcd since it possesses superconformal symmetry .",
    "moreover , the maldacena conjecture  @xcite suggests that the strongly coupled limit of the theory should be much simpler than one might otherwise expect , since it is dual to weakly coupled gravity in anti - de sitter space .",
    "the two - loop splitting amplitudes and their associated collinear constraints lead to an ansatz for the planar contributions to the @xmath16-point two - loop amplitudes in terms of the @xmath16-point one - loop amplitudes of the form  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath33 is the same function as appearing in .",
    "the @xmath37 are @xmath16-point @xmath3-loop planar amplitudes , divided by the tree amplitudes .",
    "for @xmath38 explicit calculation  @xcite confirms this ansatz .",
    "more generally , for @xmath39 the ansatz ( [ twolooponeloop ] ) satisfies the correct collinear properties , using the splitting amplitudes ( [ onelooptwoloopsplit ] ) . for the maximally",
    "helicity - violating amplitudes it is likely that the ansatz ( [ twolooponeloop ] ) is correct , but for the non - maximally helicity violating amplitudes it would be important to also check multi - particle factorization . the crucial question is whether this iterative structure holds to higher loops and whether a resummation is possible .",
    "an important step to investigate the structure would be the computation of the three - loop four - point amplitude .",
    "this computation seems feasible  @xcite , especially since one of two required integrals  @xcite has already been evaluated by smirnov  @xcite .",
