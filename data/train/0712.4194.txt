    "relativistic oscillator models for the spin-1/2 particles are a subject of rather broad interest nowadays .",
    "apart from the academic interest in equations with exact solutions , the relativistic oscillator may serve as the first approximation to description of the more realistic systems in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "in contrast to the non - relativistic case , within the framework of the dirac equation , there exist various possibilities for introducing the oscillator interaction , such as the mixture of the quadratic in coordinate vector and scalar potentials with the equal magnitude and equal or opposite signs @xcite , or the use of the non - minimal coupling scheme ( the so - called dirac oscillator ) @xcite .",
    "note that the dirac equation with the oscillator interaction has been applied recently for explaining the pseudospin symmetry in nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , for the careful description of the relativistic effects in the two - body problem it is needed to go beyond the one - particle approximation . for this end , the breit - type equations @xcite , the barut method @xcite and the relativistic quantum mechanics with constraints @xcite are usually used . with these methods , the models for the relativistic two - boson @xcite and two - fermion @xcite",
    "oscillators have been offered .",
    "recently , a new approach to the relativistic two - body problem , based on the extension of the @xmath2 group to the @xmath3 one , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to construct the wave equation for the two - body system consisted of the spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles with interaction described by means of the lorentz - vector and lorentz - tensor potentials @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to find , in addition to the mentioned two - boson and two - fermion oscillator models , an exact oscillator - like solution to the obtained equation @xcite describing the fermion - boson system . in the lack of the lorentz - vector interaction ,",
    "this solution can be regarded as the generalization of the model of the one - body dirac oscillator @xcite to the fermion - boson case .",
    "in this section , for completeness of the discussion let us briefly consider the wave equation for a fermion - boson system derived with the extension of the @xmath2 group .",
    "it is well known that the homogeneous lorentz group @xmath4 is covered by the symplectic @xmath5 group . as a consequence , the relativistic field theory in the four - dimensional space - time",
    "can equivalently be formulated entirely within the framework of @xmath6 weyl spinor formalism @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the extension of the @xmath6 group to the @xmath3 one permits us to develop a procedure of constructing relativistic wave equations for the two - body systems .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the system consisted of a spin-1/2 fermion and a spin-0 boson which interact with each other by virtue of the lorentz - vector and lorentz - tensor potentials .",
    "the wave function of this system is represented by a dirac spinor or , in our treatment , by two @xmath3 weyl spinors @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the corresponding wave equation has the dirac - like form @xmath9\\bar{\\chi }                                            \\nonumber \\\\ & & = ( m_{+}+\\tau^1\\otimes i m_{- } -\\mathrm{i}i\\otimes\\sigma^m\\tilde{\\sigma}^n c_{mn } -\\mathrm{i}\\tau^1\\otimes\\sigma^m\\tilde{\\sigma}^n d_{mn})\\varphi , \\nonumber \\\\ % \\vspace{1.4 cm }   & & [ i \\otimes \\tilde{\\sigma}^m ( w_m+a_m)+\\tau^1\\otimes\\tilde{\\sigma}^m ( p_m+b_m)]\\varphi \\nonumber \\\\ & & = ( m_{+}+\\tau^1\\otimes i m_{- } -\\mathrm{i}i\\otimes\\tilde{\\sigma}^m\\sigma^n c_{mn } -\\mathrm{i}\\tau^1\\otimes\\tilde{\\sigma}^m\\sigma^n d_{mn})\\bar{\\chi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here four - momenta @xmath10 , @xmath11 and mass parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 are related to the quantities for the particles of the system by @xmath14 @xmath15 and the lorentz - vector potentials @xmath16 , @xmath17 as well as the lorentz - tensor ones @xmath18 , @xmath19 in general case are the functions of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the relative coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "the direct matrix products contain @xmath21 and @xmath22 that are the @xmath23 matrices from the one - particle dirac equation in the weyl notation , for which we use the conventional representation : @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unit @xmath23 matrix and @xmath27 are the pauli matrices .",
    "besides , the minkowski metrics @xmath28 is accepted .    note",
    "that the first multipliers in the direct products originate due to the group extension and are essential for obtaining the two - particle interpretation of the problem .",
    "the above equation ( [ eq10 ] ) should be supplemented with the subsidiary condition @xmath29 which must guarantee that in the case when the interaction is absent the particles are on the mass shell and eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) are reduced to the free dirac and klein - gordon equations .",
    "these free equations are derived with decomposing the spinor wave functions into the projections @xmath30 that are two - component @xmath6 weyl spinors .",
    "the projections labeled by plus ( minus ) sign describe the system in which the dirac particle has mass @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and the klein - gordon particle has mass @xmath32 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , the wave equation ( [ eq10 ] ) supplemented with the subsidiary condition ( [ eq4 ] ) describes two systems composed of the spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles , which differ from each other only in permutation of masses of the particles .",
    "it is to be pointed that in the presence of the interaction the wave equation ( [ eq10 ] ) and the subsidiary condition ( [ eq4 ] ) must be compatible .",
    "the demand of the compatibility imposes the following restrictions on the shape of the potentials @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , the potentials must depend on the relative coordinate only through its transverse part @xmath36 with respect to the total four - momentum @xmath10 , which is conserved and so can be treated as the eigenvalue rather than the operator .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in the presence of the only lorentz - vector potentials the discussed approach reproduces the known equation by krlikowski @xcite , which is also derived by reducing the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite , and the equations of the relativistic quantum mechanics with constraints @xcite .",
    "in addition , being important for the study of mesonic atoms @xcite , the problem of the description of the electromagnetic interaction in the system of a fermion with an anomalous magnetic moment and a boson was considered with the quasipotential @xcite and breit - type @xcite equations . in our approach ,",
    "the corresponding potentials for this problem are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total energy , @xmath39 is the coulomb potential , @xmath40 and @xmath31 denote the anomalous magnetic moment and the mass of the fermion . with these potentials",
    "inserted , the wave equation ( [ eq10 ] ) in the semirelativistic approximation coincides with that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , the equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , derived with the extension of the @xmath2 group to the @xmath3 one , together with the subsidiary condition ( [ eq4 ] ) restores the results obtained in other approaches .",
    "however , including the lorentz - tensor potentials in our equation , in addition to the lorentz - vector ones , permits us to treat more wide range of problems concerning fermion - boson interactions and to construct the new oscillator model involved potentials of both these types of the lorentz structure .",
    "now we will construct an oscillator model for the relativistic two - body system composed of the spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles , the word  oscillator \" being taken to include all equations that can be transformed into the second - order equation containing quadratic in relative coordinate potentials .",
    "such an oscillator - like second - order equation may arise from the first - order wave equation ( [ eq10 ] ) if both the lorentz - vector and -tensor potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) are linear in the relative coordinate .",
    "however , in the case of the lorentz - vector potentials , the purely linear in @xmath41 term can be removed by including this term into the phase factor of the wave function .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the lorentz - vector potentials involve not only the relative coordinate but also the relative four - momentum . a combination of these two quantities , having the structure of the multiplication of the orbital momentum with @xmath41 , will give rise to the desired oscillator interaction . in order to avoid the klein paradox , this lorentz - vector oscillator potential must have the space - like rather than the time - like structure .    for constructing a lorentz - tensor oscillator potential , we combine the linear in the relative coordinate term with the total four - momentum , which is the constant of motion , and set the potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) as follows @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants with the dimensionality of the string tension , and the term with imaginary unit is introduced for the hermiticity of the potential .",
    "note that the oscillator potentials @xmath16 and @xmath18 must be zero because , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq10])([eq3 ] ) , they are transformed under the permutation of the particles like @xmath10 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , but being linear in @xmath41 , as the oscillator potentials , they must be transformed with the opposite sign .    the wave equation ( [ eq10 ] ) with such an interaction proved to be exactly solvable . since this equation describes two fermion - boson systems which differ from each other only in permutation of masses of the particles , we accept that the system consists of a dirac fermion with the mass @xmath31 and a klein - gordon boson with the mass @xmath32 . to find the solution ,",
    "we pass to the spinor projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for which the wave equation ( [ eq10 ] ) and the subsidiary condition ( [ eq4 ] ) , being written in the center - of - mass frame ( @xmath50 ) , are reduced to the dirac - like equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the orbital momentum of the relative motion .    in the last equation ,",
    "the total angular momentum of the relative motion , @xmath56 , is conserved",
    ". then the spatial variables are separated and we can write @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the so - called spinor spherical harmonics @xcite and the normalization of dirac spinors imply that for the upper and lower radial functions we must have @xmath59 so that @xmath60 and @xmath61 should be square - integrable functions .",
    "the quantum number @xmath62 is related to the orbital quantum number @xmath63 by the expression @xmath64 -(l+1 ) & = -\\left ( j+1/2\\right ) , & l = j-1/2\\ \\ \\",

    "the lower radial function is obtained from eqs .",

    "it should be pointed that the appearance of the signum function in eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) imposes a restriction on the permitted values of the coupling constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "for example , if @xmath84 , there always exists a value of @xmath63 such that for @xmath85 we have @xmath86 whereas for @xmath87 we get @xmath88 . then from eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) it follows that for @xmath89 the level @xmath90 will be lower than the level @xmath82 . for avoiding this unphysical order of levels ,",
    "it is sufficient to demand that either @xmath91 or @xmath92 . in the following , only the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 which obey these conditions are considered .",
    "the derived energy spectrum of the fermion - boson system with the discussed oscillator interaction has proved to be essentially distinctive from that of the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "the reason is that both the lorentz - vector and -tensor potentials contribute to the strong spin - orbit coupling . in the expression ( [ eq37 ] ) for the eigenenergies , the spin - orbit coupling is described by the term containing @xmath93 [ note that @xmath94 .",
    "this term breaks the @xmath95-degeneracy , which is inherent in the spectrum of non - relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "moreover , in eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) a common factor @xmath96 , playing the role of an effective oscillator frequency , is @xmath62-dependent , too .",
    "this implies that the spectrum is not equidistant except for the case when the lorentz - vector interaction is absent ( @xmath97 ) .    if @xmath98 , the spacing of the energy levels depends on whether @xmath43 is positive or negative . for the case",
    "@xmath99 , a typical spacing of the first energy levels is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spek1 ] where the spectrum was evaluated with parameters @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in natural units . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spek1 ] it can be seen that the ground - state levels with @xmath104 and @xmath105 are degenerate and correspond to the lowest energy eigenvalue @xmath106 .",
    "in contrast to this , the degeneracy does not occur in the case @xmath107 , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spek2 ] , in which the energy levels are evaluated using @xmath108 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in natural units .",

    "the levels with the same @xmath83 which become degenerate when @xmath109 are connected by dashed lines.,width=340 ]    to proceed , let us consider a particular case when @xmath110 and @xmath109 , i.e. when the only lorentz - vector interaction is present .",
    "it should be noticed that in this case our model reduces to that offered within the framework of the relativistic quantum mechanics with constraints @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the subcase @xmath99 was considered and the corresponding energy spectrum was proved to display the parity - doubling phenomenon . however , we have found that in the other subcase ( @xmath107 ) not only the exact oscillator - like solution exists , but also the parity doubling has a different meaning .",
    "for @xmath99 the parity doubling means that the state with quantum numbers @xmath111 is degenerate with the state with the quantum numbers @xmath112 , as can be checked by putting @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) [ see also fig .  [",
    "fig : spek1 ] ] . on the contrary , for @xmath107",
    "the parity doubling reveals itself as the degeneracy of the states with @xmath111 and @xmath113 which correspond to the same value of @xmath114 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : spek2 ] ] .    a few remarks concerning the parity doubling are in order .",
    "there exists reasonably strong experimental evidence that orbitally excited baryons occur in pairs of nearly degenerate states of opposite parity ( for a review see @xcite ) . in our oscillator model",
    ", the parity doubling of this kind takes place in the subcase @xmath107 , whereas for @xmath99 the spectrum includes the degenerate ground states with @xmath104 and @xmath115 which are absent in the baryon spectra .",
    "in addition , the appearance of the parity doubling is closely related to the lorentz - structure of the involved potentials .",
    "so , in the generalized nambu - jona - lasinio model of hadrons the parity doubling occurs when the space - like lorentz - vector potential dominates over the lorentz - scalar one @xcite .",
    "analogously , in our approach the parity doubling appears when @xmath109 and the potential becomes a pure spatial lorentz vector .    now let us turn to the second particular case , in which @xmath92 , i.e. , the pure lorentz - tensor interaction is retained . in this case our oscillator - like solution can be treated as the generalization of the one - body dirac oscillator model @xcite to the fermion - boson case . recall that the dirac oscillator is obtained by replacing the momentum @xmath116 in the dirac equation by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the usual dirac matrix and @xmath119 is the oscillator frequency .",
    "it is obvious that eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) for the fermion - boson system transforms into the equation for the dirac oscillator after inserting @xmath92 , @xmath120 and passing to the one - particle limit , in which the boson has a mass much larger than the fermion .",
    "note that the passage to this one - particle limit does not affect the interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the case @xmath92 the spectrum of the fermion - boson system will have the same order of the energy levels as the spectrum of the dirac oscillator .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have constructed the relativistic oscillator model for the two - body system consisted of the spin-1/2 fermion and the spin-0 boson interacting by virtue of the lorentz - vector and lorentz - tensor potentials . for this model ,",
    "the analytical expressions for the wave functions and the energy eigenvalues have been obtained .",
    "the exact solubility of the oscillator model suggests it may be used as the first approximation in the study of more complicated systems in hadron and nuclear physics .",
