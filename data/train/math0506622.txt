    "[ main ] let @xmath1 be a complete @xmath0-factorial toric variety with dense torus @xmath13 , and let @xmath14 be a divisor on @xmath1 .",

    "let @xmath22 be the space of @xmath0-divisors on @xmath1 , modulo numerical equivalence .",
    "since the stable base locus of the sum of two divisors is contained in the union of their stable base loci , the set of classes in @xmath22 that are represented by divisors whose stable base locus has codimension greater than @xmath2 is a convex cone ( for a general numerical class , the stable base locus is independent of the choice of representative ( * ? ? ? * and 10.3 ) ) .",
    "we write @xmath23 for the closure of this cone in @xmath24 .",
    "this notation is suggestive of the fact that @xmath23 is also the closure of the cone of numerical classes of divisors that are ample in codimension @xmath2 , that is , the cone of numerical classes of divisors @xmath14 such that there is an open set @xmath25 , with @xmath26 ample , whose complement has codimension greater than @xmath2 .",
    "the cone @xmath27 of pseudo - effective divisors , the closure of the cone of numerical clases of effective divisors , is filtered by the cones @xmath28 : @xmath29    we have an analogous filtration of the cone @xmath30 of pseudo - effective curves , as follows .",

    "* theorem 1.19 ) ) .",
    "another heuristic reason to believe that equality should not hold for general @xmath2 comes from the consideration of small modifications @xmath40 , with @xmath12 complete and @xmath0-factorial .",
