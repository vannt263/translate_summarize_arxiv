    "observations pinpoint massive dark objects , conceivably supermassive black holes ( bhs ) with masses @xmath6 @xmath7 , at the center of most nearby bright galaxies ( see richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the space density of bright optical quasars ( qsos ) is found to be lower by some @xmath8 relative to the bright galaxies ( see , e.g. , boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "these observations support the view of the qsos as a short active phase ( lasting @xmath9 yrs ) of supermassive bhs which accrete surrounding gas at rates @xmath10 @xmath7/yr , see rees ( 1984 ) .",
    "if the accretion history starts from small primordial seeds ( madau & rees 2000 ) , the accretion rate sets not only the qso bolometric luminosities @xmath11 erg / s ( with standard mass - to - energy conversion efficiency @xmath12 , see , e.g. , yu & tremaine 2002 ) , but also the relic bh masses .",
    "additional observations relate the history of @xmath13 , and so the qso evolution , with the galaxy structure and formation . these include the very magnitude of @xmath14 that needs to be drawn from the whole bulge of the hosts , and the correlation of @xmath15 with the bulge luminosities ( see richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) , or better with the velocity dispersion @xmath16 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "relations of the sort have been explored in the framework of the hierarchical clustering scenario ; here the galaxies condense from gravitationally unstable regions in the primordial density field of the dark matter ( dm ) , then are assembled into poor groups and eventually into rich clusters .",
    "such attempts are based either on analytic approaches ( see cavaliere & szalay 1986 ; efstathiou & rees 1988 ; carlberg 1990 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; burkert & silk 2001 ; hatzminaoglou et al .",
    "2002 ) , or on semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation ( see kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; monaco , salucci , danese 2000 ; volonteri , haardt & madau 2002 ) .",
    "but the fraction @xmath17 actually accreted out of the galactic gas remained as a phenomenological quantity , described only in terms of scaling recipes , either containing tunable parameters or adjusted from the outset to the form of the observed correlations .",
    "yet , all such models hardly accounted for the observed dramatic drop of the qso population between @xmath18 and the present .    on the other hand , a physical law for the accretion has been proposed by cavaliere & vittorini ( 2000 , cv00 ) ; they suggested the amount of the cool galactic baryons accreted onto bhs to be given by the fraction @xmath19 destabilized and sent toward the nucleus by the gravitational torques arising either in major merging events ( at @xmath20 ) or in encounters of the host with other galaxies inside a common dm halo ( at @xmath2 ) .",
    "they use two analytic evaluations for the two regimes ; in the latter they derive declining encounter rates and fast gas exhaustion concurring to produce an interestingly steep evolution of bright qsos .    here",
    "we self - consistently compute halo and galactic quantities using a hierachical sam of the kind proposed by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; somerville & primack ( 1999 ) ; cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . specifically , we insert the cv00 model in the sam developed by menci et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; this includes galaxy interactions , and accounts for several statistical properties of the galaxy population like counts , @xmath0-resolved luminosity functions ( lfs ) , sizes .",
    "this will allow us to continuously link the accretion history @xmath13 and the qso evolution with a fiducial model of galaxy formation consistent with the stellar observables .",
    "the independent variables of our sam ( menci et al . 2002 ) are : the circular velocity @xmath21 of the host dm halos ( groups and clusters of galaxies with mass @xmath22 and virial radius @xmath23 ) containing the galaxies ; the circular velocity @xmath24 of the dm clumps associated with the individual member galaxies .",
    "the former grow hierarchically to larger sizes through repeated merging events ( at the rate given in lacey & cole 1996 ) , while the latter may coalesce either with the central galaxy in the common halo due to dynamical friction , or with other satellite galaxies through binary aggregations .",
    "the timescale for such galactic processes generally exceed the timescale for the merging of the host halos , so member galaxies accumulate in growing host halos .    at the cosmic time",
    "@xmath25 the sam yields the following dynamical quantities . @xmath26",
    "the distribution @xmath27 ( per mpc@xmath28 ) of galaxies with circular velocity in the range @xmath29 in host halos with circular velocity in the range @xmath30 .",
    "this is derived by computing iteratively the probability for a host halo to be formed from its progenitors , together with the probability that the member galaxies coalesce due to either dynamical friction or binary aggregations . as initial condition",
    "we assume a press & schechter distribution , and we assign one galaxy to each host halo . from @xmath27",
    "we derive the number @xmath31 of galaxies in a host halo ( membership ) , and the overall distribution of galaxy circular velocity @xmath32 irrespective of the host halo .",

    "these dynamical quantities are associated to the baryons contained in the galactic dm halos in the way standard for sams .",
    "initially the baryons contained in a galactic halo are in the amount @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 the dm mass of the galaxies ) and at the virial temperature ; the mass @xmath39 of cold baryons is that residing in regions interior to the `` cooling radius '' .",
    "stars are allowed to form with rate @xmath40 , with the disk dynamical time evaluated as @xmath41 .",
    "finally , a mass @xmath42 is returned from the cool to the hot gas phase due to the energy fed back by canonical type ii supernovae associated to @xmath43 .",
    "the feedback efficiency is taken to be @xmath44 .",
    "the values adopted for the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 km / s fit both the local b - band galaxy luminosity function and the tully - fisher relation , as illustrated by menci et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at each merging event , the masses of the different baryonic phases are refueled by those in the merging partner ; the further increments @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 from cooling , star formation and feedback are recomputed iterating the procedure described above .",
    "all computations are made in a @xmath51-cdm cosmology with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , a baryon fraction @xmath54 , and hubble constant @xmath55 in units of 100 km s@xmath56 mpc@xmath56 .",
    "here we just recall the key points of cv00 , and recast their main equations in a form suitable for implementation in our sam .    for a galaxy with given @xmath24 ,",
    "the accretion of a fraction @xmath19 of the cold gas onto the central bh is intermittently triggered by interactions occurring at a rate @xmath57 here @xmath58 , and the cross section @xmath59 is averaged over all partners with tidal radius @xmath60 in the same halo @xmath21 .",
    "to this effect , the sizes , the relative velocities of the galaxies and the distribution of galaxy circular velocities in a common halo are previously computed from the sam sector described in  2 .",
    "the fraction of cold gas accreted by the bh in each interaction event is computed in eq .",
    "a3 of cv00 in terms the variation @xmath61 of the specific angular momentum @xmath62 of the gas , to read @xmath63 here @xmath64 $ ] is the impact parameter , evaluated as the maximum between the galaxy @xmath65 and the average distance @xmath66 of the galaxies in the halo . also , @xmath67 is the mass of the partner galaxy in the interaction , and the average runs over the probability of finding a galaxy with mass @xmath67 in the same halo @xmath21 where the galaxy @xmath68 is located",
    ". the prefactor accounts for the probability ( 1/2 ) of inflow rather than outflow related to the sign of @xmath61 , and for the fraction ( 1/4 ) of the inflow actually reaching the nucleus rather than kindling circumnuclear starbursts , see mirabel & sanders ( 1996 ) .",
    "note from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that both the interaction rate @xmath69 and the accreted fraction @xmath19 decrease with time , since in the growing host halos the increasing membership @xmath70 is offset by the increasing @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath71 . in a group the values for @xmath19 range from a few @xmath72 to several @xmath73 .",
    "the above behaviour of the accreted fraction @xmath19 is illustrated in the top panel of fig .",

    "we take @xmath78 , and we obtain the blue luminosity @xmath79 by applying a bolometric correction of 13 ( elvis et al . 1994 ) .    the mass of the bh hosted in a galaxy with given @xmath24 at time @xmath25 is updated after @xmath80 assuming in all galaxies small seeds bhs of mass @xmath81 ( madau & rees 2001 ) ; our results are insensitive to the specific value as long as it is smaller than @xmath82 .",

    "bottom : the mass function of bhs for various values of the redshift @xmath0 .",
    "in fig . 1 ( bottom ) we plot the mass function of bhs at four different redshifts . note the mild evolution from @xmath84 to the present , due to the decrease of the accreted fraction @xmath19 ( see top of fig . 1 ) and of the related @xmath77 dut to the declining rate of merging and encounters ( see  3 ) , and to the simultaneous exhaustion of the galactic cold gas @xmath86 available for accretion ( see inset in fig.1 ) .    the relation we obtain between the bh mass and the central 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath16 of the host galaxy is shown in fig .",
    "we use the canonical relation @xmath87 approximately holding for an isothermal profile ( see binney & tremaine 1986 ) .",
    "the steep slope of our relation ( close to @xmath88 in the range @xmath89 ) is the combined result of two processes : the merging histories of the galactic dm clumps , which by themselves would imply the mass of cold available gas to scale as @xmath90 ; the destabilization of the cold gas by the interactions , which steepens the relation to @xmath91 .",
    "the further steepening to @xmath92 is provided by the supernovae feedback which depletes the residual gas content in shallow potential wells .",
    "no effort has been done to adjust the latter to match the relation to the data ; a slope steeper yet would be provided , especially in the upper range , by adding the feedback from the qso emission itself onto the host gas ( which does not alter the average galactic star formation in a group ) .",

    "the computed emissions , limited by the eddington luminosity @xmath103 , peak at @xmath104 ; such redshifts are those where our sam predicts the buildup of bright galaxy to peak ( see menci et al .",
    "note that if no eddinton limit were imposed , the density would be that represented by the dashed line in the bottom panel , which overshoots the data ; this shows that at @xmath105 the qsos do emit at their full @xmath103 , due to the high merging rate which provides abundant refueling . at later times , the fueling is triggered mostly by the interactions with encounter rate declining as discussed in  3 , and draws from scarce residual gas approaching exhaustion .",

    "it provides good fits to the observations concerning the @xmath5 correlation , the evolution of the qso luminosity function , and their space density selected at different optical magnitudes .",
    "the agreement holds in the full range @xmath112 _ continuously _ covered by our model , and supports the underlying picture that follows .    at @xmath105",
    "the qsos emit at their full eddington limit , because the high merging rate in this epoch of galaxy assemblage insures both a high baryonic content in their hosts and an abundant bh fueling . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , in this range the lfs are _ flat _ ( consistent with by recent data , see fan et al .",
    "2003 ) and _ rise _ with time . at @xmath113",
    "the _ steep drop _ we find for the population results from three concurring processes : 1 ) the declining rate of merging between early galaxies , which halts the acquisition of new gas available for accretion ; 2 ) the progressive exhaustion of the baryon reservoirs in the hosts , consumed by fast conversion into stars and by previous accretion episodes ; 3 ) the eventual decline of the fraction @xmath114 of residual cold gas which is destabilized and accreted onto the central bhs by the dwindling interactions between galaxies .",
    "the latter ( see fig.1 ) is at variance with the kauffmann & haehnel ( 2000 ) model , and is crucial in matching the observed strong evolution of qsos at @xmath115 ; as a consequence , our model predicts an average eddington ratio dropping from @xmath116 at @xmath18 to @xmath117 at @xmath4 , with a weak dependence on @xmath15 , consistent the with available data ( see woo & urry 2002 ) .",
