    "such ambiguity is discussed since a long time and recognized as the local - itinerant dilemma of ce-@xmath20 electrons @xcite , not completely elucidated yet .",

    "the unit cell volume dependence on sc concentration and the c / a lattice parameters ratio are shown in fig .",

    "the increase of the unit cell volume can be explained by the larger atomic volume of sc with respect to ti , whereas the reduction of the c / a ratio is due to the increase of the a parameter because the c one remains practically unchanged .",

    "the electrical resistivity measurements normalized at 300k of some representative concentrations between @xmath71 are presented in fig .",

    "the maxima of @xmath75 coincide with the respective transition temperatures extracted from magnetic measurements .",
    "a common feature along this concentration range is the lack of a @xmath32 jump at @xmath76 . instead",
    ", a tail in @xmath77 is observed , indicating the presence of magnetic fluctuations above the transition temperature .",
    "notably , in the low sc concentration samples ( @xmath78 ) the maximum of @xmath74 decreases as @xmath79 .",
    "this fact implies that the maximum of @xmath80 does not extrapolate to zero with @xmath81 in contradiction with the thermodynamic principles .",
    "such a sort of entropy bottleneck would have impede @xmath81 even if the cescsi - type structure would have extended to @xmath82 .",

    "another characteristic of this range of concentration is the decrease of @xmath84 extrapolation from @xmath85j mol@xmath86k@xmath87 to @xmath88j mol@xmath86k@xmath87 between @xmath58 and 0.65 .",
    "coincidentally , the increase of the low temperature curvature in @xmath89 indicates a progressive opening of a gap of anisotropy ( @xmath90 ) in the magnon spectrum that for @xmath65 reaches @xmath91k as shown by the fitting curve included in fig .",

    "[ f8 ] for samples @xmath65 and 0.80 . for the latter composition",
    "the computed gap is @xmath94k .",
    "the main difference with the alloys with lower sc concentration is the split of @xmath74 into two maxima , in agreement with the @xmath55 results .",
    "while the lower transition ( at @xmath95 ) shows a cusp - like anomaly between @xmath96 and 0.9 , the upper one identified as @xmath97 from @xmath55 measurements is associated to a jump in @xmath98 within this range of concentration .",
    "the cusp at @xmath95 can be related to the vicinity of the critical point accounting that in these policrystalline samples any eventual first order transition would be broadened in temperature because of the random direction distribution of crystals and some broadness in concentration . within this range of concentration ,",
    "the shape of the upper transition at @xmath97 is typical for a second order transition .    for @xmath99 ,",
    "a further change in @xmath89 is observed as depicted in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ f8 ] . the broad shoulder of @xmath89 in samples @xmath100 can be attributed to the increase of the gs degeneracy from @xmath101 to 4 as the contribution of the first exited cef doublet set on .",
    "also the transitions change their characteristics because while the one at @xmath102 transforms into a step like anomaly , that at @xmath97 becomes sharper and grows significantly .",
    "notice that the @xmath103 jump in @xmath104 is @xmath105j mol@xmath86k@xmath86 is between the values expected for a doublet ( @xmath106 ) and a quartet ( @xmath107 ) predicted in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "the small anomaly observed in @xmath108 at @xmath109k can be attributed to an extrinsic contribution of a small amount of ce - oxide .",
    "the @xmath110 hysteresis loops measured at @xmath111k on the alloys with @xmath52 reveal the fm character of the ordered phase ( see fig .",
    "[ f6]a ) concomitant with the increasing value of @xmath112 measured at @xmath113koe presented in fig .",
    "the saturation magnetization , extracted from fig .  [ f6]b as @xmath114 , increases from @xmath115 for @xmath116 up to 1.15@xmath117 for @xmath83 and then decreases to 1@xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , the coercive field increases from @xmath119koe for @xmath116 up to 2.6koe for @xmath83 , whereas for @xmath120 a metamagnetic transition occurs .",
    "the critical field @xmath121 increases with concentration up to our experimental limit of @xmath113koe with an initial ratio of @xmath122koe / sc@xmath123 .",
    "however @xmath110 measurements , performed on stoichiometric cescge @xcite , report the metamagnetic transformation around @xmath124koe with a weak associated hysteresis . measurements at higher magnetic field ( up to 30 t @xcite ) reveals anothe magnetic rearrangement at @xmath125koe . notably , the area of the hysteresis loop decreases as @xmath126 tends to its upper value , see fig .",
    "[ f6]b , and becomes quasi irrelevant at the cescge limit @xcite .      in order to evaluate the energy of the excited cef levels ,",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath127 dependence of the @xmath58 sample which shows the lowest ordering temperature .",
    "for that purpose we have fit the experimental data accounting that the cef splits the six fold hund s rule multiplet originated in the @xmath128 orbital momentum of ce into three doublets . due to the hybridization ( kondo effect ) acting on the first excited level , the standard schottky anomaly ( @xmath129 )",
    "can not describe the @xmath127 dependence properly .",
    "since a proper fit including usual hybridization effects ( @xmath130 ) between conduction and @xmath131 states acting on each excited level requires complex calculation protocols @xcite , a simple criterion to mimic the broadening of the levels was applied in this case . in this procedure",
    "the first cef exited doublet at @xmath132 is described using three single dirac levels equally distributed in energy around the nominal value of the non hybridized level .",
    "this procedure requires the strength of the hybridization to be smaller than the cef splitting ( @xmath132 ) , i.e. @xmath133 . for simplicity , the second excited cef level ( at @xmath134 ) was included without accounting for hybridization effects because @xmath134 largely exceeds our temperature range of analysis .",

    "the obtained parameters are @xmath139k and @xmath140k , with a broadening of the first cef level @xmath141k .",
    "this procedure was checked with the evaluation of the magnetic entropy ( @xmath142 ) , which for the two excited doublets reaches @xmath143 .",
    "this procedure can not be applied for higher sc concentrations because of the increase of @xmath60 .",
    "although no significant changes are expected in the cef levels splittings , the reduction of the electrical charges in the transition metal crystal sites from rich ti [ ar4s@xmath1443d@xmath144 ] to sc [ ar4s@xmath1443d@xmath146 may reduce the strength of the cef and reduce the @xmath147 .",
    "this variation may be at the origin of the increasing contribution of the first excited cef level to the magnetic ordering .",
    "the analysis of the thermal evolution of the magnetic contribution to the entropy @xmath148 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] normalized by the value of a kramer s doublet level : @xmath149 .",
    "this parameter provides relevant information to understand this magnetically complex system better .",
    "the alloy @xmath63 with the lowest ordering temperature at @xmath150k reaches @xmath151 slightly above @xmath152 , at @xmath153k , suggesting that only the gs doublet contributes to the magnetic order .",
    "however , since in the paramagnetic phase @xmath148 increases continuously ( i.e. without showing any plateau around @xmath149 ) one may infer that the tail of the first excited cef level also contributes to the entropy at low temperature .",
    "this fact confirms the cef level spectrum extracted from the fit of @xmath127 performed on this , presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] .",
    "although the contribution of that level may be marginal in the alloys with low sc content , it becomes significant for higher concentrations as @xmath154 increases with @xmath155 .",
    "this feature becomes evident for @xmath42 alloys , where @xmath156 clearly exceeds @xmath149 and , for @xmath104 practically reaches the value for two doublets , i.e. @xmath157 , in agreement with the corresponding value observed in @xmath103 .",
    "the comparison of the thermal distribution of the entropy above and below @xmath60 also provides a hint for the effective dimensionality of the magnetic system . according the theoretic predictions @xcite , in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems , the entropy accumulated between @xmath158 and @xmath76 is similar to that contained in the tail of @xmath159 . in this case , samples with @xmath160 sc concentration fulfil that property once the @xmath161 contribution is subtracted .",
    "such is not the case for the samples beyond the critical point for which the @xmath97 transition shows the characteristic @xmath103 jump of a 3d second order transition .",
    "the main parameters of this system are collected in the magnetic phase diagram presented in fig .",

    "according to the literature @xcite , this behavior is observed in itinerant systems where sdw develops , in agreement with the @xmath72 anomaly detected at @xmath170 in @xmath171 alloys .",
    "the main characteristic of this system is the rapid variation of the magnetic nature of its ordered phase with sc concentration , likely due to an increasing role of the first excited cef doublet into the gs properties .",

    "the evolution of the specific heat anomaly at the @xmath95 transition suggests a small discontinuity in the magnetic wave vector .",
