    "quantum state discrimination @xcite is a basic tool for many tasks in quantum information and quantum communication . in the prototype problem",
    "a quantum processor generates a quantum system as its output which is in one of a set of known states but we do not know which and want to determine the actual state . if the possible states are not orthogonal this can not be done with 100% probability of success since the cloning of quantum states is impossible .",
    "there are two basic strategies to accomplish state discrimination . in the first , every time a measurement is performed we want to identify the state of the output with one of the possible states .",
    "clearly , errors must be permitted and in the error minimizing strategy the optimum measurement is such that the probability of error is minimum .",
    "the case of discriminating with minimum error between two possible states was treated in the pioneering work by helstrom @xcite .",
    "more recently , the interest was focused on the unambiguous discrimination . in this strategy",
    "we are not permitted to make an erroneous identification of the state .",
    "the cost associated with this condition is that sometimes we fail to identify the state altogether . in the optimum strategy",
    "the probability of failure is a minimum .",
    "the optimal value of the failure probability for two known and equally likely pure states was obtained by ivanovic , dieks and peres ( idp bound , @xcite ) .",
    "later jaeger and shimony @xcite generalized the idp bound for arbitrary preparation probabilities of the states , i. e. for arbitrary prior probabilities of the two possible states .    the actual state - distinguishing device for two _ known _ states depends on the two states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i. e. these two states are `` hard wired '' into the machine .",
    "another approach is to supply the information about the states to be distinguished as inputs , in particular as quantum inputs .",
    "that is , one encodes the information about the states one wants to distinguish into a quantum state , which is then a kind of quantum program , that is sent into the discriminator at the same time as the particle whose state is to be identified .",
    "the first such device was proposed by duek and buek @xcite .",
    "this device distinguishes the two states @xmath4 , and the angle @xmath5 is encoded into a one - qubit program state in a somewhat complicated way .",
    "the performance of this device is good ; it does not achieve the maximum possible success probability for all input states , but the average value of its success probability , averaged over the angle @xmath5 , is greater than 90% of the optimal value . in a series of recent works fiurek _",
    "investigated a closely related programmable device that can perform a von neumann projective measurement in any basis , the basis being specified by the program .",
    "both deterministic and probabilistic approaches were explored @xcite , and experimental versions of both the state discriminator and the projective measurement device were realized @xcite .",
    "et al . _ developed a related device , which they called a quantum matching machine @xcite .",
    "its input consists of @xmath6 copies of two equatorial qubit states , which are called templates , and @xmath7 copies of another equatorial qubit state @xmath8 .",
    "the device determines to which of the two template states @xmath8 is closest .",
    "this device does not employ the unambiguous discrimination strategy , but optimizes an average score that is related to the fidelity of the template states and @xmath8 .",
    "programmable quantum devices to accomplish other tasks have been explored by a number of authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently two of us proposed an approach to a programmable state discriminating machine in which the program is related in a simple way to the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 that one is trying to distinguish @xcite .",
    "a motivation for this problem is that the program state may be the result of a previous set of operations in a quantum information processing device , and it would be easier to produce a state in which the information about @xmath2 and @xmath3 is encoded in a simple way than one in which it is encoded in a more complicated way .",
    "the program is the most elementary possible , it consists of copies of the states one is trying to distinguish .",
    "the device then performs optimally with the given program states or , in other words , it optimally identifies the data state with one of the two unknown program states , or reference states , respectively . despite the complete lack of classical information about the reference states , the identification is still possible due to symmetry properties that are intrinsically quantum mechanical , and are similar to those first employed by barnett _",
    "@xcite for the purpose of comparing unknown states .",
    "the original results in @xcite were for unambiguous discrimination and for qubit data and program states .",
    "they have recently been extended to qudits by hayashi _",
    "et al . _ , both for optimum unambiguous discrimination @xcite and for minimum error discrimination @xcite .",
    "their investigations are restricted to equal prior probabilities , where the data state equally likely matches each one of the program states , but they also dealt with the case in which an arbitrary number of copies is provided for each of the two program states .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the programmable state discriminator introduced in @xcite in several other directions and develop a comparative study of programmable state discriminators based on the two measurement strategies of minimum - error discrimination and optimum unambiguous discrimination . for this purpose in sec .",
    "ii we first reformulate the problem of programmable state discriminators as a problem of discrimination between two mixed quantum states .",
    "iii is devoted to the case that both of the pure states to be discriminated are unknown so we need a reference state for each . in part",
    "a we treat the error minimizing version of the programmable state discriminator , considering both a joint measurement on all three qubits , and also a measurement prescription that is restricted to two - qubit measurements only . in part b we rederive the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the unambiguous version of the programmable state discriminator partly for comparison s sake but also using the consistent approach based on the equivalent mixed state discrimination problem .",
    "it should be noted , in this context , that the results of ref . @xcite",
    "were obtained in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ manner and the current approach gives a solid foundation to those results .",
    "we also compare the optimal probabilities obtained in parts a and b for the programmable state discriminators based on the two possible strategies . in sec .",
    "iv we fill another gap and show how to construct devices that can optimally discriminate between one known and one unknown state using both minimum - error and optimum unambiguous strategies .",
    "that is , we know what @xmath9 is , but do not know @xmath3 .",
    "then we need a reference state only for the unknown state , which constitutes the program in this case .",
    "we can say that this line of investigation characterizes the quality of the source that produces the states to be discriminated , or the quality of our knowledge about the source , respectively .",
    "if both possible states are known ( the original idp and helstrom problem ) there is no need for a program , the states are hard wired into the optimal device .",
    "if one of the states is known we need a program for the unknown state while the other is hard wired into the device and if both states are unknown we need a program for both .",
    "we also take look at another aspect of the problem .",
    "namely , besides investigating the effect of the source quality on the optimal performance of this family of state discriminating devices , we also investigate the effect of the resources on the performance of these devices .",
    "suppose that instead of one copy of the state to be discriminated we are given @xmath0 copies , but we still only possess one copy each of the unknown state(s ) as the program state ( or none for two known states ) . in sec .",
    "v we therefore generalize the two unknown qubit scenarios of sec .",
    "iii for the case when @xmath0 copies of the input state , and one copy of the program states , are provided . in sec .",
    "vi we provide a similar generalization of the one unknown qubit cases treated in sec .",
    "iv . in each of these cases",
    "we determine the optimal measurement strategy both for minimum error and unambiguous discrimination of the data state .",
    "the devices that accomplish this are programmable , in the first case the program consists of two qubits , one in @xmath2 and one in @xmath3 , while in the second case the program consists of a single qubit in the state @xmath3 .",
    "note that in all cases , the program is extremely simple .",
    "it is what could be called a `` quantum list '' , a set of qubits , one in each of the states to be discriminated , or one each in some subset of the states to be discriminated . in sec .",
    "vii we conclude with a brief discussion of how these results can be used to characterize the preparation quality ( source quality ) and to quantify the available resources .",
    "let us begin by briefly reviewing the problem that was originally addressed in @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of three qubits , labeled @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , and assume that the qubit @xmath10 is prepared in the state @xmath2 , and the qubit @xmath12 is prepared in the state @xmath13 .",
    "qubit @xmath11 is guaranteed to be prepared in either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , with a probability @xmath14 of being in @xmath2 and a probability @xmath15 of being in @xmath3 .",
    "the states @xmath2 or @xmath3 are different and unknown .",
    "our task is to find whether the state of qubit @xmath11 is @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "one way of looking at this problem is to view the qubits @xmath10 and @xmath12 as a program .",
    "they are sent into the program register of some device , called a programmable state discriminator , and the third , unknown qubit is sent into the data register of this device .",
    "the device then tells us , with an optimal probability of success , which one of the two program states the unknown state of the qubit in the data register corresponds to .",
    "we can consider this problem as a task in measurement optimization .",
    "we want to find an optimal measurement strategy that , with a maximum probability of success , tells us which one of the two program states , stored in the program register , matches the unknown state , stored in the data register . in @xcite",
    "only unambiguous discrimination was treated , in which the measurement is allowed to return an inconclusive result but never an erroneous one . here",
    "we want to investigate the measurement strategy of minimum - error discrimination , as well . in general , we want to determine the best possible measurement for identifying the state of the qubit @xmath11 .",
    "our task is then reduced to the following measurement optimization problem .",
    "one has two input states latexmath:[\\ ] ]    where we introduced @xmath90 ( @xmath89 ) as the smaller ( larger ) of @xmath396 . according to eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) , the minimum error probability is reached with the help of the detection operators @xmath397 and @xmath398 , where we have to use the identity @xmath399 . clearly , the measurement that identifies the state of the data qubits with the smallest possible error is a joint projection measurement on the qubits @xmath364 ( for @xmath400 ) and @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath305 the formulas in this section reduce to those of sec .",
    "iv.a whereas for @xmath306 we have that @xmath401 since in this latter case the mixed states that we are trying to distinguish become essentially orthogonal .",
    "the vanishing of the error probability for @xmath402 is in accordance with the fact that the data state can be in principle exactly determined by tomographic methods , without any joint measurement , provided that an infinite number of copies is available . after the data state has been determined , it is of course possible to tell without error whether it is equal to the state @xmath21 or not .",
    "finally we want to determine the minimum failure probability for the unambiguous discrimination between the states given by ( [ sigma1l1 ] ) and ( [ sigma2l1 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we again use the method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "taking one of the reduction theorems derived in @xcite into account , the most general ansatz for the detection operators can be written as @xmath403 where @xmath404 and @xmath405 were given in ( [ vtwobar ] ) and ( [ utwobar ] ) , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath185 as required for unambiguous discrimination . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ qfail ] ) , these detection operators yield the failure probability @xmath406 which again has to be minimized under the constraint that @xmath187 is a positive operator , in complete analogy to our procedure in sec .",
    "iv a. for @xmath188 we obtain the expression @xmath407 the eigenvalues of @xmath132 are @xmath408 , @xmath409 for @xmath410 , and @xmath411 .",
    "they all are non - negative provided that @xmath412 . in order to minimize @xmath136 while keeping @xmath132 a positive operator we therefore choose @xmath413 upon substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ qfail21 ] ) the failure probability becomes a function of @xmath152 alone and it is easy to determine its optimum .",
    "taking into account that @xmath196 , we find that the minimum failure probability is obtained when    @xmath414    substituting these values into ( [ op41 ] ) yields @xmath415 . using @xmath416 and @xmath415 in eqs .",
    "( [ op11 ] ) and ( [ op31 ] ) yields an explicit expression for the optimum detection operators .    if @xmath417 , which implies that @xmath418 $ ] , we have @xmath111 and @xmath419 , which means that the optimum measurement is a projection measurement on the subspace orthogonal to the span of @xmath420 , i. e. a projection on its kernel . on the other hand , for @xmath421 , i.e.   @xmath422 , the optimum measurement is a joint projection measurement on the kernels of @xmath420 and @xmath391 , where @xmath423 and @xmath424 . in the intermediate parameter region",
    "the optimum measurement is a generalized measurement .",
    "the failure probability of these optimal measurements can be summarized as    @xmath425    we notice the the above expressions reduce to the corresponding expressions of sec .",
    "iv.a for @xmath305 , as they should .",
    "then , as in that section , it is also true here that the benefit of performing the generalized measurement is only marginal . to see the closeness of the best pvm ( projective valued measurement ) to the optimal povm",
    "we compare their performance in several ways .",
    "the two pvms ( first and last line in ( [ qfopt ] ) ) deliver the same result for @xmath426 .",
    "in fact , the reduction of the povm failure probability ( middle line ) compared to those of the projective measurements is largest for this value of @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "3 we display the pvm and povm failure probabilities for this value of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath0 . we see that the two curves remain close together for all values of @xmath0 .    the difference between these two curves as a function of @xmath0 reaches a maximum , however .",
    "it is maximal for @xmath427 as displayed in fig .",
    "4 .    finally , in fig .",
    "5 we display the ratio of the pvm failure probability to the povm failure probability as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "asymptotically , the povm outperforms the pvm by 50% , their ratio tending to the limiting value of @xmath428 .",
    "however , as we see from the figure , one needs about a @xmath429 copies of the data state to reach the asymptotic region . since the difference is maximal for five copies we can conclude that one does not need more than five copies in order to demonstrate performance enhancement due to the optimal povm .    to close this section",
    "we also notice that , in agreement with the general relation derived in @xcite , the optimal povm failure probability is always more than twice as large as the minimum error probability @xmath210 of the previous subsection .",
    "we have described a number of quantum devices that discriminate between two quantum states .",
    "we do not possess complete information about the states to be discriminated .",
    "our devices have two inputs , one for the qubit whose identity is to be determined , and the other for the copies of one or both of the possible states that it can be in . in the case",
    "that only one of the states is provided , it is assumed that the other state is known , and this knowledge is built into the device .",
    "the states sent into the second input can be regarded as a program . to change the set of states between which we are discriminating",
    ", we do not have to change the device , but merely supply it with a different program .",
    "we want to point out a striking feature of the programmable state discriminators in which copies of both of the states to be discriminated are provided .",
    "neither the optimal detection operators nor the boundaries for their region of validity depend on the unknown states .",
    "therefore , these devices are _ universal _ , they will perform optimally for any set of unknown states . only the probability of success for fixed but unknown states will depend on the overlap of the states . however , both this expression and its average over all possible inputs is optimal .",
    "the devices described here demonstrate the role played by _ a priori _ information .",
    "all of them have a smaller success probability than one designed for a case in which we know both of the input states , and the device for two unknown input states has a smaller success probability than one designed for the case when we know one of the input states .",
    "there is a trade off between flexibility and success probability .",
    "the more of the information about the states that is carried by a quantum program , the smaller the probability of successfully discriminating between the states , but the larger the set of states for which the device is useful .",
    "this flexibility suggests that programmable discriminators will be useful as parts of larger devices that produces quantum states that need to be identified .",
    "we conclude our paper by summarizing what we know about programmable discriminators with quantum programs in which the programs consist of copies of the states to be discriminated .",
    "the most general problem of this type is when we have @xmath430 copies of the state of the program system @xmath10 , @xmath431 copies of the state of the program system @xmath12 , and @xmath432 copies of the state of the data system @xmath11 . in this case ,",
    "the task is to discriminate two input states latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath12 refer to the program registers ( @xmath10 contains @xmath2 and @xmath12 contains @xmath3 ) , and the subscript @xmath11 refers to the data register . our goal would be to optimally distinguish between these inputs , keeping in mind that one has no knowledge of @xmath2 and @xmath3 beyond their _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "the problem in which the numbers of copies of the program states are equal and greater than one , but we have only one copy of the data state is solved for equal _ a priori _ probabilities @xcite .",
    "the problem in which we have only one copy of each program state , but an arbitrary number of copies of the data state has been solved here .",
    "the general problem remains open .",
