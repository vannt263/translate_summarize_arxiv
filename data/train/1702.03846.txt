    "quantized vortices @xcite are coherent excitations in bose - einstein condensates , which can arise due to the superfluid property of such a condensate .",
    "these are stationary flows characterized by their quantized circulation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the probability current velocity , @xmath3 the probability current density , @xmath4 the probability density , and @xmath5 the phase of the wave function @xmath6 .",
    "vortices in bose - einstein condensates have been studied theoretically @xcite since the introduction of mean - field theory for bose - einstein condensates .",
    "later on , several techniques to create vortices experimentally have been proposed and also realized like rotating traps @xcite , stirring condensates via laser beams @xcite , phase imprinting techniques @xcite or temperature quenching via the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite .    in this",
    "paper vortices are investigated in the presence of coherent balanced gain and loss of particles described via complex @xmath0-symmetric potentials .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics was introduced by bender and boettcher in 1998 @xcite , where they found that the requirement of a hermitian hamiltonian is not the most general condition to ensure real energy eigenvalues required for a physical theory .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that a hamiltonian which possesses an unbroken @xmath0symmetry has purely real eigenvalues . here",
    ", the unbroken @xmath0symmetry is defined in such a way that @xmath7 = 0 $ ] and in addition all eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are simultaneously eigenfunctions of the @xmath0operator .",
    "such a hamiltonian is called pseudo - hermitian @xcite and allows for complex potentials if the real and imaginary parts are symmetric and antisymmetric functions of the position vector @xmath8 , respectively .    an imaginary part of a potential is generally interpreted as an additional gain - loss term .",
    "this can be understood if one calculates the continuity equation for the ( non)linear schrdinger equation with a complex potential . after a short calculation one obtains @xmath9 the imaginary part of the potential acts as an additional source or drain term in the range where it overlaps with the wave function .",
    "a @xmath0-symmetric situation differs from a general complex potential in such a way that the gain and loss contributions are balanced .",
    "this allows for stationary states with real energies , and @xmath0symmetry is used as an effective theory for an easier description of this dynamical process within the framework of stationary equations .    since the discovery of bender and boettcher @xmath0symmetry has become important in many areas of physics .",
    "most theoretical studies are in the fields of quantum mechanics @xcite or quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems have been discussed for bose - einstein condensates described in a two - mode approximation @xcite , in position space @xcite , and in model potentials @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of @xmath0symmetry could also be studied in microwave cavities @xcite and electronic devices @xcite .    in optics ,",
    "the idea of @xmath0symmetry can be applied as well to describe wave guides with complex refractive indices @xcite , and it is possible to observe this experimentally @xcite .",
    "by contrast , an experimental confirmation of @xmath0symmetry in a quantum mechanical system is still lacking .",
    "however , if @xmath0symmetry is applied to the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation to describe a dilute bose - einstein condensate @xcite , the gain and loss can be interpreted as a coherent in- and outcoupling of particles , which may be possible to implement experimentally @xcite . therefore , bose - einstein condensates are a good candidate for the first quantum mechanical system to observe @xmath0symmetry .",
    "it is the goal of this work to demonstrate that stable vortex excitations in bose - einstein condensates with @xmath0-symmetric gain and loss can exist .",
    "we will study the influence of the in- and outcoupling strength on stationary states as well as on the dynamics of non - stationary states .",

    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model and explain the numerical techniques used . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] we show and discuss two qualitatively different spectra containing vortices arising due to different imaginary potentials .",
    "additionally , the transition from vortex to non - vortex states at a critical gain - loss parameter value and the influence of the interaction strength are explained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] we investigate the stability of states using the bogoliubov - de gennes formalism and a time evolution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] the dynamics of non - stationary vortex states in the presence of a @xmath0-symmetric potential is studied . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize the obtained results .",
    "we consider a dilute bose - einstein condensate with contact interaction , which is described in the mean - field limit by the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we assume that the condensate is confined in a harmonic oscillator trap , @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the condensate will be disc - shaped and the description can be effectively reduced to two dimensions @xcite . in addition , an imaginary potential @xmath12 is present , which describes the in- and outcoupling of particles . with the use of harmonic oscillator units , @xmath13 the dimensionless effectively two - dimensional stationary gross - pitaevskii equation reads @xmath14\\psi = \\mu \\psi\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 and the effective two - dimensional chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "the trap potential reads in these units @xmath17 and the interaction strength is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the effective two - dimensional repulsive s - wave scattering length .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 determines the strength of the gain and loss .",
    "we investigate several different imaginary parts @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , we will use three different potentials labeled a ) , b ) , c ) to discuss the observed properties .",
    "they read    [ eq : vi ] @xmath21    and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials ] .",
    "these potentials represent an incoupling on the right and an outcoupling on the left side .",
    "thus , we expect a current from right to left .",

    "the parameter is @xmath22 . ]    to solve the gross - pitaevskii equation numerically , this partial differential equation was discretized and expressed in a harmonic oscillator basis , in which the problem reduces to a high - dimensional nonlinear root search .",
    "this works quite well as the potential is mainly harmonic oscillator - like and we are considering not too large nonlinearities . here ,",
    "a 2d - harmonic oscillator product basis up to the quantum numbers @xmath23 was used , which results in @xmath24 basis states . for the calculation",
    "the quadratic field of view was set to @xmath25 $ ] and discretized with @xmath26 points .",
    "we are interested in low - lying excited states , therefore initial guesses for the root search are the harmonic oscillator ground state , the first excited state oriented in @xmath27-direction as well as its counterpart in @xmath28-direction .",
    "a superposition of the two first excited states , one as real and one as imaginary part to imprint a vortex phase , is used as an initial guess for a vortex state .",
    "first the interaction strength is fixed to @xmath29 and the parameter @xmath20 is varied to study the influence of the gain - loss effect .",
    "this results in two qualitative different spectra in dependence of the chosen imaginary part .",
    "exemplarily for potentials and the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_g1 ] .",
    "what is common for all investigated potentials is that there is a range of the gain - loss parameter @xmath20 , in which a vortex state exists .",
    "actually , there are two vortex states which are degenerate as their only difference is their direction of circulation . however , at a critical value of @xmath20 the vortex merges with the lowest excited state in a pitchfork - bifurcation .",
    "it depends on the potential with which state the vortex merges .",
    "if the in- and outcoupling peaks lie close to the origin , the excited state oriented parallel to the direction of the external current ( excited @xmath27-state ) has lower chemical potential than the excited state oriented perpendicular to the external current ( excited @xmath28-state ) . for larger distances from the origin the order of the energy values changes .",
    "in addition , the distance has an influence on a second tangent bifurcation of the excited state oriented in @xmath27-direction with the ground state . only for lower distances of the gain - loss peaks from the origin",
    "this bifurcation exists , for larger values there is no such bifurcation .      chemical potential ( top ) and the individual contributions e@xmath31 and e@xmath32 ( bottom ) of the excited states as a function of the gain - loss peaks position @xmath30 from the imaginary potential .",
    "the parameters are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "modulus squared of the wave functions of the excited states in potential ( upper two rows ) and the corresponding potentials ( lower row ) for different values of the gain - loss peaks position @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "let us first discuss how the two qualitatively different spectra arise . for this analysis we use the potential with the variable distance @xmath30 of the gain - loss peaks .",
    "we fix the gain - loss strength to @xmath34 and vary the distance @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_spectrum_d ] the chemical potential @xmath16 as well as the individual contributions of the average value of the kinetic and potential operator , @xmath35 are shown as functions of @xmath30 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_wave_function_d ] the excited states and the potential are shown for selected values of @xmath30 .    for this example the imaginary part vanishes for @xmath36 , as the in- and outcoupling peaks cancel each other .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27- and @xmath28-states become degenerate . for increasing @xmath30",
    "the in- and outcoupling peaks lie close to the origin at first .",
    "this causes a shift of the probability density of the @xmath27-state to the origin , which results in a decrease in the potential energy .",
    "as the gain - loss peaks are oriented in @xmath27-direction , the @xmath28-state does not experience such a shift and the potential energy does not drop .    at some value of @xmath30",
    ", the gain - loss peaks exceed the point at which the position of the @xmath27-state peaks without complex potential are located . behind this point the @xmath27-state probability density is shifted outwards again , which leads to an increase of the potential energy .",
    "the @xmath28-state is again not substantially affected .    eventually at a value of @xmath37",
    ", the increase in the potential energy of the @xmath27-state leads to a higher chemical potential @xmath16 than that of the @xmath28-state . for even higher @xmath30",
    "the peaks move out of the probability density range of the wave functions and the influence , i.e. , the in- and outcoupling , vanishes .",
    "the chemical potentials of the two states approach each other again .",
    "this explains also why the second bifurcation of the ground and an excited state only occurs for the excited @xmath27-state .",
    "the ground state resembles the excited @xmath28-state in @xmath27-direction and behaves similar to the excited @xmath28-state , i.e. , it is also less affected by the gain - loss . due to this similar behavior ,",
    "the distance between their chemical potentials can not change as much as between the excited @xmath27-state and the ground state , therefore , these states do not coalesce .",
    "now we discuss the transition of vortex to non - vortex states .",
    "the bifurcation point , at which the vortex changes to an excited state without vorticity , marks a so - called exceptional point @xcite . at this point",
    "not only the energies but also the states themselves coalesce .",
    "this is a feature which can not occur in hermitian systems but can result in non - hermitian or nonlinear hamiltonians .    to explain this transition it is useful to consider the wave function and phase as well as the probability current density calculated with @xmath38 these quantities",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_functions_g1 ] for the potentials and for different values of the gain - loss parameter @xmath20 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "i.e. , no gain - loss , the vortex solutions are totally symmetric and positioned at the origin .",
    "only the circular vortex current is present .    for increasing @xmath20",
    "the behavior slightly differs in dependence of the imaginary potential . in the case of the bifurcation with the @xmath27-excited state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_functions_g1 ] ( left ) ) , the vortex center shifts towards the bottom .",
    "for the ( not shown ) vortex with opposite circulation the center shifts towards the top . due to the additional current from right to left ,",
    "the shape of the vortex adapts itself in such a way that the probability density on the top is higher than that on the bottom by shifting the vortex center .",
    "therefore , the natural vortex current is enhanced from right to left at the top , while the current is suppressed from left to right at the bottom . the basic shape of the wave function becomes more and more asymmetric in @xmath28-direction .",
    "the whole solution is cut into two parts . finally , the vortex center is expelled in the region at the wave function s border , at which the probability density vanishes . at that point",
    "the vortex decays and changes into the first excited state with the two peaks on the left and right of the origin .",
    "the vortex current from left to right at the bottom comes to a halt as the external current is stronger than the vortex current .",
    "the transition from the vortex to the excited state in @xmath28-direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_functions_g1 ] ( right ) ) occurs in a different way . here",
    "the vortex center performs only a slight movement in @xmath28-direction but then returns back to the center .",
    "an ejection in @xmath27-direction , which would be the nodal line for the excited @xmath28-state , was not possible since a movement of the vortex center in this direction would break the @xmath0symmetry of the wave function .",
    "what happens is that the probability density nearly drops to zero in the lower half of the vortex , in which the current flows in opposite direction to the external current .",
    "this brings the circular vortex current to a halt and the vortex dies at its location .",
    "thus , the vortex does not vanish as a result of the center ejection but simply by stopping the current in one direction while the center stays on the nodal line of the excited @xmath28-state .      after having fixed @xmath29 in the previous examples , now the influence of higher interaction strengths",
    "will be discussed .",
    "what can we expect ?",
    "as we are considering repulsive interaction , a higher strength will spread the wave function more to the outside .",
    "we have shown that the type of spectrum we obtain depends on the position @xmath30 of the in- and outcoupling peaks relative to the natural wave function position without gain and loss .",
    "therefore , at a small fixed distance @xmath30 an increase of @xmath40 should not change the spectra qualitatively as the in- and outcoupling peaks are located inside the wave function s maxima anyway . in the case of the second spectra from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_g1 ] ( right side ) for large @xmath30 , a qualitative transition to the type of the first spectra may occur as the probability density of the wave function can be shifted beyond the in- and outcoupling peaks . however ,",
    "this is something which happens not in every case and depends on the actual form of the imaginary part .    for the example potentials and the spectra for different values of @xmath40",
    "can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_g ] . in both cases",
    "the separation between vortex and excited state increases for increasing nonlinearity .",
    "this results from the fact that , due to the two strongly located peaks of the excited states in comparison to the more blurred vortex , the interaction energy of the excited states increases stronger for higher interaction strength .",
    "therefore , the vortex states become energetically more favorable for increasing @xmath40 .",
    "the spectra for potential stay qualitatively the same , while for potential a transition of the spectra type can be observed .",
    "however , as already mentioned , this is nothing what happens in general .",
    "calculations with different potentials do not always show such a transition . to be precise , in these cases the excited @xmath27-state",
    "may be located below the excited @xmath28-state in some regions but eventually the positions switch again .",
    "in reality the system can not be perfectly isolated and there will always be small fluctuations .",
    "only if the states survive within such an environment and live for a sufficiently long time , they may be observed experimentally .",
    "therefore , it is important to check the stability of the states .",
    "first the linear stability is checked using the bogoliubov - de gennes formalism . within this formalism",
    ", a small time - dependent fluctuation @xmath41 is added to a stationary state @xmath42 @xmath43{\\mathrm{e}}^{-{\\mathrm{i}}\\mu t}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one uses the ansatz @xmath44 with a positive value @xmath45 . inserting this ansatz into the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation and neglecting terms in the order of",
    "@xmath46 one obtains the linear bogoliubov - de gennes equations , which can be written in matrix form as @xmath47 with @xmath48 this linear eigenvalue problem can again be expressed and diagonalized in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "if there are solutions with complex frequencies @xmath49 , the fluctuations will exponentially increase , which is a clear sign of an unstable state .",
    "due to the @xmath0symmetry , if @xmath49 is a solution , then @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are also solutions , therefore , it is sufficient to consider only @xmath49 with positive imaginary part .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdg_g1 ] the imaginary eigenvalues are shown for the two different spectra for the potentials and . in the first case , the ground and the vortex state are always stable .",
    "the excited @xmath27-state is unstable in the range where it coexists with the vortex but becomes stable after the bifurcation point . in the second case",
    "the vortex is not stable over the whole range in which it exists . only for smaller values of @xmath20",
    "it is stable , at a value of @xmath53 there is an unstable region until the end of the vortex existence .    to consider also nonlinear fluctuations and confirm the bogoliubov - de gennes analysis ,",
    "a time evolution is performed .",
    "we take the exact eigenstates , add random noise and let it evolve in time .",
    "if the state is stable , it will only perform small fluctuations or slightly oscillate but keep its basic shape over time , whereas an unstable state will completely deform or decay .",
    "the time evolution is performed using the split - operator method , where the time evolution operator @xmath54 is split symmetrically for a small time step @xmath55 as @xmath56 with @xmath57 this expression is evaluated with forward and backward fourier transforms @xmath58 \\right ] \\right]\\right]\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as we work with a finite grid , reflections at the border or wraparounds in the fourier space can occur .",
    "these artifacts can be reduced by increasing the discretization range or introducing absorbing borders @xcite . however , in this case it is not necessary to remove all the artifacts , as they can be considered as additional distortions .",
    "this confirms the stability of states even more if they survive under this condition .",

    "this time evolution confirms the result from the bogoliubov - de gennes analysis . for the potential",

    "vortex movement has already been discussed in literature @xcite and there are several facts known .",
    "the motion of a bose - einstein condensate with its center of mass positioned out of the trap center can be described like that of a classical single particle in an effective potential @xcite .",
    "the movement of the particle corresponds to the center of mass movement of the condensate .",
    "a movement of the vortex relatively to its background causes a magnus force on the vortex perpendicular to its velocity @xcite , which results in a precession around the trap center .",
    "the magnus force has a hydrodynamic cause created by a pressure gradient resulting from a suppression and an enhancement of the vortex current on the opposite sites .    for our study",

    "if this parameter exceeds a critical value , i.e. , the point at which the additionally introduced external current is stronger than the internal vortex current , the vortex decays . in the presence of the external current the stationary vortex adapts itself in such a way that it shifts its vortex center and changes the background shape such that a net current exists .",
    "if the vortex decays it changes into the energetically closest excited state , which manifests itself in a bifurcation and an exceptional point in the spectra .",
