    "<S> an alternative and highly successful description of a tagged particle is offered by the langevin equation @xcite . in this stochastic approach , newton s equation of motion for the particle </S>",
    "<S> is extended by a friction force and a fluctuating force that account for the interaction with the surrounding fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the langevin equation enables simple evaluation of the macroscopic properties of the diffusing particle , without the need to compute complicated collision integrals as in the boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is valid in the brownian limit of a heavy tracer particle , where the friction coefficient is independent of the velocity of the particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental studies of brownian motion have been reported in gases @xcite and liquids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the usual langevin equation with constant friction does not hold for light tracer particles in dilute gases @xcite .    here </S>",

    "<S> the high resolution of our setup further allows to detect the effect of a single collision on the dynamics of the tracer atom . </S>",
    "<S> discrete hard - sphere collision simulations reveal that only few collisions suffice to thermalize a cs atom to the cloud temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally demonstrate that the measured spatial distribution of tagged cs atoms is well described , without any free parameters , by a generalized langevin equation with a velocity - dependent friction coefficient @xcite . to our knowledge , this extension of the langevin equation has never been experimentally verified so far .        in our experiment , </S>",

    "<S> after entering the cloud , a cs atom undergoes collisions with the cold rb atoms and thermalizes . </S>",
    "<S> ultracold temperatures in the micro kelvin range lead to slow dynamics , both for the gas and the tracer atoms , with thermal velocities around @xmath13 mm s@xmath14 . while at room temperature , heavy tracer particles are bombarded at an extremely high rate ( of the order of @xmath15 hz in air @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> ultra low temperatures , a small mass ratio of the order of unity and low gas densities reduce this collision rate to values between @xmath16 hz at the center and @xmath17 at the edges of the gas cloud . </S>",
    "<S> hence the effective mean free time between two collisions is in the experimentally accessible range of @xmath18ms . </S>",
    "<S> for the finite size cloud , there is a non - zero probability that a cs atom does not collide at all and moves unperturbed through the cloud ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we have again accounted for three - body losses by removing tracer atoms at each time step with the probability @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> as before , the cloud density @xmath50 , and thus the friction coefficient @xmath59 , were evaluated at the position of the tagged atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the diffused fraction of cs atoms ( left ) is well described by the langevin simulations ( blue ) , without free parameters , for all values of the rb density . however , as expected , the unperturbed fraction ( right ) is not captured by the langevin approach which assumes that all test particles experience damping and fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between the simulated and measured spatial distributions for the diffused fraction is larger than @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we once more ascribe the small deviation to the experimental uncertainties of the reference measurements . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , langevin simulations with the usual velocity - independent friction coefficient ( brown ) yield overlaps as low as @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the following physical picture emerges from our experimental and theoretical investigations . </S>",
    "<S> our ability to accurately identify the effect of a single collision allows the distinction of two different types of dynamics : thus , cs atoms that do not experience any collision pass ballistically through the dilute rb cloud ( unperturbed fraction ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a single collision event dissipates on average more than half of the initial nonthermal kinetic energy and suffices to trap a tagged cs atom inside the cloud , leading to additional collisions ( diffused fraction ) . </S>",
    "<S> after few more collisions , a tracer atom will be thermalized with the rb cloud . </S>",
    "<S> its dynamics is correctly described , over a wide range of knudsen numbers , by a generalized langevin equation with a velocity - dependent friction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this unfamiliar speed dependence may be understood by noting that the velocity @xmath43 of a heavy brownian particle ( @xmath67 ) is much smaller than that of the gas atoms . as a result , both the collision rate and the friction coefficient are independent of  @xmath43 in this limit . by contrast , for an atomic tracer with a mass @xmath68 , both velocities are of the same order . here , an explicit velocity dependence of the collision rate and of the friction coefficient can no longer be neglected . however , as we have shown , in both cases , a highly successful continuous langevin description over a coarse - grained timescale larger than the mean free time between impacts is possible .    </S>",
