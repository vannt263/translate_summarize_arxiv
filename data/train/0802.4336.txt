    "some extensions of the standard model provide dark matter ( dm ) candidate particles with sub - gev mass ; in the following these candidates will be indicated as light dark matter ( ldm ) .",
    "light dark matter particles have been considered for example in warm dark matter scenarios such as e.g. kev - scale sterile neutrino @xcite , axino or gravitino @xcite . in addition , mev - scale particles ( e.g. axino @xcite , gravitino @xcite , heavy neutrinos @xcite , moduli fields from string theories @xcite , _ elko _ fermions @xcite ) have been proposed as dark matter and as source of 511 kev gamma s from the galactic center , due either to dm annihilation @xcite or to decay @xcite in the bulge . moreover , also supersymmetric models exist where the lsp naturally has a mev - scale mass and the other phenomenological properties , required to generate the 511 kev gammas in the galactic bulge @xcite .    in this paper the direct detection of ldm candidate particles is investigated considering the possible inelastic scattering channels either on the electron or on the nucleus target .",
    "we note , in fact , that  since the kinetic energy for ldm particles in the galactic halo does not exceed hundreds ev  the elastic scattering of such ldm particles both on electrons and on nuclei yields energy releases well below the energy thresholds of the detectors used in the field ; this prevents the exploitation of the elastic scattering as detection approach for these candidates .",
    "thus , the inelastic process is the only possible exploitable one for the direct detection of ldm .",
    "the following process is , therefore , considered for detection ( see fig.[fg : diagram ] ) : the ldm candidate ( hereafter named @xmath12 with mass @xmath13 and 4-momentum @xmath14 ) interacts with the ordinary matter target , @xmath15 , with mass @xmath16 and 4-momentum @xmath17 .",
    "the target @xmath15 can be either an atomic nucleus or an atomic electron depending on the nature of the @xmath12 particle interaction . as result of the interaction a lighter particle is produced ( hereafter @xmath18 with mass @xmath19 and 4-momentum @xmath20 ) and the target recoils with an energy @xmath21 , which can be detectable by suitable detectors .    [ !",
    "ht ]     the lighter particle @xmath18 is neutral and it is required that it interacts very weakly with ordinary matter ; thus , the @xmath18 particle escapes the detector . in particular",
    ", the @xmath18 particle can also be another dm halo component ( dominant or subdominant with respect to the @xmath12 one ) , or it can simply be a standard model particle ( e.g. @xmath18 can be identified with an active neutrino in the scenario of the mev axino of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the diagrams @xmath22 have been considered ) .",
    "the production mechanism of the @xmath12 ( and eventually of the @xmath18 ) in the early universe are beyond the scope of the present paper and can be investigated in the future ; however , since @xmath23 , it is important to require that the lifetime of the possible decay of the @xmath12 particle is longer than the age of the universe . in particular , we note that the detection process of fig.[fg : diagram ] also offers a possible ( unavoidable ) decay channel of @xmath12 into @xmath18 and @xmath24 pair if @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we remind that a ldm particle detection has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the possible light bosonic ( kev mass axion - like particles ) dark matter candidate has been studied , considering the total conversion of its mass into electromagnetic radiation . in the present case , because of the presence of the @xmath18 particle in the final state , the ldm can be either a boson or a fermion .    in the following ,",
    "the direct detection of ldm candidate particles is investigated , some theoretical arguments are developed and related phenomenological aspects are discussed .",
    "in particular , the impact of these dm candidates will also be discussed in a phenomenological framework on the basis of the 6.3 @xmath26 c.l .",
    "dama / nai model independent evidence for particle dark matter in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "we remind that various corollary analyses , considering some of the many possible astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics scenarios , have been analysed by dama itself @xcite , while several others are also available in literature , such as e.g. refs . @xcite .",

    "the interaction rate of the ldm particle with the target @xmath15 and for the studied process can be written as : @xmath67 where : i ) @xmath68 , with @xmath69 local halo density and @xmath70 fractional amount of @xmath12 density in the halo ; ii ) @xmath71 is the target number density in the detector ; iii ) @xmath72 is the differential cross section of the considered ldm particle inelastic scattering with the target @xmath15 ; iv ) @xmath73 is the velocity ( @xmath74 ) distribution of the @xmath12 particles in the earth ( laboratory ) frame .",
    "since the sub - gev ldm wavelength ( @xmath75 fm ) is much larger than the nucleus size , the targets can be considered as point - like and the form factors of the targets can be approximated by unity .",

    "we note that @xmath46 and @xmath45 depend on the target mass and slightly on the ldm velocity , @xmath79 .",
    "generally , @xmath77 can be a function of @xmath79 , depending on the peculiarity of the particle interaction . in the following ,",
    "we adopt a widely considered approximation for the non - relativistic case @xcite ( the subscript @xmath15 drops ) : @xmath80 there @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constant and depend on the peculiarity of the particle interaction with the target @xmath15 ; they will be considered as free parameters in the description of the process . in the following , in order to deal the direct detection process with more usual parameters , the cross sections @xmath83 and @xmath84 will be used as free parameters ; they are related to the @xmath81 and @xmath82 parameters rescaled with the dark matter local velocity , @xmath85 , @xcite .    thus , eq . ( [ eq : rate ] ) ,",
    "becomes : @xmath86 since : @xmath87 , the total rate @xmath88 can be written as : @xmath89 similarly as the light bosonic case discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath90 term provides an annual modulation of the expected counting rate for ldm interactions .",
    "in fact , the velocity of the ldm particle in the galactic frame can be defined as : @xmath91 .",
    "thus , one obtains for non rotating halo : @xmath92 .",
    "since the earth velocity in the galactic frame ( @xmath93 ) is given by the sum of the sun velocity ( @xmath94 ) and of the earth s orbital time - dependent velocity around the sun ( @xmath95 ) , neglecting the @xmath96 term one gets : @xmath97 in the last equation the angle of the terrestrial orbit with respect to the galactic plane has been considered to be @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , we consider @xmath99 with @xmath100 year , and the phase @xmath101 ( which corresponds to @xmath102 2nd june , that is , when the earth s speed in the galactic frame is at the maximum ) . the sun velocity can be written as @xmath103 km / s , where @xmath85 is the local velocity , whose value is in the range 170 - 270 km / s @xcite .",
    "the earth s orbital velocity is @xmath104 km / s .",
    "finally , @xmath105 depends on the halo model and on the @xmath85 value ( just for reference , in the particular simplified case of isothermal halo model : @xmath106 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the expected signal is given by the sum of two contributions : one independent on the time and the other one dependent on the time through , with relative amplitude depending on the adopted scenario .",
    "for atomic electron targets , the energy interval @xmath107 is always very narrow @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , using the approximation @xmath109 , the interaction rate with atomic electrons can be simply written as :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the electron number density in the target detector and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the average ( over all the atomic electrons ) cross section parameters for electrons in the target material .",
    "after the interaction the final state can have  beyond the @xmath18 particle  either a prompt electron and an ionized atom or an excited atom plus possible x - rays / auger electrons .",
    "therefore , the process produces x - rays and electrons of relatively low energy , which are mostly contained with efficiency @xmath114 in a detector of a suitable size .",
    "therefore , the differential counting rate can simply be written accounting for the detector energy resolution , by means of the @xmath115 kernel , which generally has a gaussian behaviour : @xmath116 there @xmath117 is the energy resolution of the detector and @xmath118 is the area of the gaussian peak centered at the @xmath44 value .",
    "finally , the expected differential rate is given by the sum of two contributions : @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the unmodulated and the modulated part of the expected differential counting rate , respectively .      as regards the interaction with target nuclei ,",
    "when considering the cases of heavy target and for relatively `` high '' ldm mass the energy interval @xmath107 can not be neglected .",
    "therefore , the interaction rate with the nucleus @xmath15 can be approximated as : @xmath122 where @xmath71 is the nucleus number density in the material and @xmath123 are the @xmath124 values for the nucleus @xmath15 calculated at @xmath125 .",
    "considering the case of a crystal detector target ( as e.g. the nai(tl ) ) , the possible channeling effect @xcite has also to be taken into account .",
    "the detection of a nuclear recoil of kinetic energy , @xmath21 , is , in particular , related to the response function @xmath126 @xcite , where @xmath127 is the released energy in kev electron equivalent .",
    "thus , the differential @xmath127 distribution for the nucleus @xmath15 when accounting for the channeling effect can be written as : @xmath128    hence , the expected differential counting rate for ldm interaction with nucleus @xmath15 can easily be derived accounting for the detector energy resolution kernel @xmath129 : @xmath130    finally , as for the electron interacting ldm , the expected differential rate is given by the sum of two contributions : @xmath131 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the unmodulated and the modulated part of the expected differential counting rate , respectively .",
    "in this section as template purpose , some examples on interaction rate of ldm particles in nai(tl ) detectors are given .",
    "in particular , since the expected energy distribution for electron kg@xmath132 in nai(tl ) . ] interacting ldm has a simple gaussian behaviour ( see eq .",
