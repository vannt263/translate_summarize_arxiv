    "the quantum rabi model ( qrm ) describes one of the simplest strongly coupled quantum systems : a single bosonic mode interacts with a two - level system .",

    "although the lower part of the spectrum of the qrm can be computed numerically to arbitrary precision using exact diagonalization on a truncated state space due to the convergence properties of the associated continued fraction  @xcite , it is by no means evident whether the properties of the numerically obtained eigenstates correspond to those of the true eigenstates of the untruncated model . even if the spectra of the truncated and the full model are close for a subset of the eigenvalues , the corresponding eigenvectors could still be related by a unitary transformation , which does not necessarily approach the identity .",

    "all of them implement a truncation procedure at some stage of the calculation and thus can not answer the basic question on the relation of the truncated to the full model .    beside this theoretical goal , there is a quite practical reason to investigate the true eigenbasis of the qrm : to compute the dynamics of the system on all time scales , not only the exact eigenvalues , but also the exact eigenstates are required . only then one may hope to predict reliably the behavior of qubits within a circuit qed setup  @xcite .    in this paper",
