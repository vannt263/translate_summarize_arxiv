    "the process of deuterium enrichment in molecules from hd , the main reservoir of deuterium in molecular clouds , is initiated by three exothermic ion - molecule reactions ( e.g.  millar et al .",

    "moreover , the freeze - out of co and other neutrals , particularly relevant in high - density gas ( @xmath4 ) , further boosts the deuteration process ( e.g.  bacmann et al .",
    "@xcite , crapsi et al .",
    "@xcite , gerin et al .",
    "therefore , in dense and cold cores the deuterated fraction , , defined as the abundance ratio between a deuterated molecule and its hydrogenated counterpart , is expected to be much higher than the average [ d / h ] interstellar abundance ( of the order of @xmath5 , oliveira et al .",

    "for example , dnc is produced in the gas from the same route reaction as , namely reaction ( [ eqa ] ) , so that ( hnc ) and ( ) are expected to vary similarly with temperature ( turner  @xcite ) .",
    "however , sakai et al .  ( @xcite ) have measured ( hnc ) in a sample of 18 massive cores including both infrared - dark starless cores and cores harbouring high - mass protostellar objects , and found that ( hnc ) in the starless cores is only marginally higher than that measured in the protostellar cores .",
    "this anomaly could be explained by the fact that the destruction processes of  are much faster than those of dnc : being an ion ,  can recombine quickly ( few years ) with co and/or electrons , while the neutral dnc has to be destroyed by ions ( such as  and/or h@xmath6 ) through much slower ( @xmath7 yrs ) chemical reactions ( sakai et al .",

    "we assume a static homogeneous cloud core with a h@xmath112 volume density of 10@xmath10 @xmath113 or 10@xmath114 @xmath113 . to mimic the protostar formation",

    "the two temperatures are consistent with the average kinetic temperatures measured in the targets of this work ( @xmath115  k and @xmath116  k for hmscs and hmpos , respectively , see table  [ tab_dfrac ] ) .",
    "our choice of 10@xmath114 yr is comparable to the timescale of high - mass starless - phase ( @xmath117 yr ) estimated by the statistical study of chambers et al .  ( @xcite ) , while parsons et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated it to be a few 10@xmath11810@xmath10 yr .    a comparison between model predictions and observational results is illustrated in fig .  [ models_data ] .",
    "in our model , in the pre - protostellar stage ( @xmath119 k ) the deuteration of both molecules increases similarly with time : this is due to the fact that the deuterium fractionation is initiated in both species by the same route reaction ( i.e. h@xmath6 isotopologues ) , as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] . on the other hand , if we assume that the deuterated fractions of the hmscs must be compared with the model predictions before the temperature rise , i.e. before @xmath120 yr , the measured ( hnc ) and ( ) can not be reproduced simultaneously in a single model : ( hnc ) can be well reproduced with @xmath121 @xmath113 , while ( ) is reproduced with @xmath122 @xmath113 .",
    "this discrepancy could indicate that the observed lines of dnc ( and hn@xmath11c ) arise from regions that , on average , are less dense than those responsible for the emission of  ( and ) .",
    "in fact , the observational parameters are averaged values measured over slightly different angular regions ( @xmath123@xmath12  for dnc , and @xmath124@xmath12for ) , so that the emission seen in dnc could be more affected than that seen in  by the contribution from the low - density envelope surrounding the dense cores , where the deuterium fractionation is expected to be less important .",
    "this can explain why the model with lower average gas density can reproduce ( hnc ) , but not ( ) , for which a higher average gas density is needed .",
    "another possibility is that we are missing something in the current chemical model .",
    "for example , we do not consider the ortho state of hydrogen molecules in this work .",
    "the presence of ortho - h@xmath112 suppresses the deuteration process of molecules , since the internal energy of ortho - h@xmath112 helps to overcome the endothermicity of reaction ( 1 ) in the backward direction ( flower et al .",
    "if we consider ortho - h@xmath112 , however , both the dnc / hnc and /  abundance ratios would be lowered .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ models_data ] also shows that an average ( ) @xmath125 in a starless core with @xmath122 @xmath113 is reached at a time close to @xmath126 yrs . assuming this as the time necessary for the starless core to collapse , as suggested by chambers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , this means that only cores relatively close to the onset of gravitational collapse , i.e. the so  called pre  stellar cores , can give rise to the observed high values of ( ) .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with the predictions of chemical models including also the spin states of the h@xmath112 and h@xmath6 isotopologues ( kong et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in which levels of ( ) larger than 0.1 are possible only in cores older than @xmath126 yrs .",
    "models with higher average density ( @xmath127 ) can reproduce such high deuterated fractions in shorter times , but these average densities are not realistic to represent regions with angular sizes of @xmath124@xmath12 , like those that we have observed .    in the protostellar stage",
    "( @xmath128 k ) , the /  abundance ratio sharply decreases in timescale of @xmath12910@xmath130 yrs , while the dnc / hnc abundance ratio decreases in @xmath12910@xmath10 yrs both in the model with @xmath121 @xmath113 and in that with @xmath131 @xmath113 .",
    "again , the measured ( hnc ) is better reproduced by the model with @xmath121 @xmath113 after 10@xmath1010@xmath114 yr from a temperature rise , while our model slightly underestimates ( ) , regardless of the average gas density , unless the protostellar cores are extremely young ( i.e. age shorter than @xmath132 yrs ) .",
    "it should be noted that once the gas temperature rises , not only the /  ratio , but also the  abundance decreases significantly in the models . also , according to models of spherical star - forming cores ( aikawa et al .",
    "@xcite , lee et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the central warm gas is still surrounded by a spherical shell of cold and dense gas during the early stages of collapse , in which both  and  are still abundant .",
    "this is not taken into account for simplicity in our one - box model .",
    "however , such residual emission from the cold envelope could explain the higher /  ratio still apparent after the sudden temperature rise .",
    "we have observed the dnc and ( 10 ) rotational transitions towards 22 massive star - forming cores in different evolutionary stages , towards which ( ) was already measured by fontani et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the work was to compare ( hnc ) to ( ) in the same sample of sources and with similar telescope beams , so that the comparison should not suffer from possible inconsistencies due to different sample selection criteria .",
    "the main observational result of this work confirms the predictions of the models of sakai et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , namely that ( hnc ) is less sensitive than ( ) to a sudden temperature rise , and hence it should keep more than ( ) of the thermal history of the cores , despite the chemical processes leading to the deuteration of the two species are similar . therefore",
