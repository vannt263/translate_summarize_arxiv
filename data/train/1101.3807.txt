    "the standard model ( sm ) can be extended by adding of three right - handed neutrino states , which would be singlets of the gauge group of sm , but coupled to matter just through the neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "but in minimal extensions of the standard model , considering a mass term for left - handed neutrinos purely of dirac is not theoretically favored , because it can not explain easily why neutrinos are much lighter than the charged leptons .",
    "thus , we assume that neutrinos have majorana masses and acquire their small masses through of the type i seesaw mechanism .    in both lepton and quark sectors of the extended standard model ,",
    "analogous fermions in different generations , say @xmath3 and @xmath4 or @xmath5 and @xmath6 , have completely identical couplings to all gauge bosons of the strong , electroweak interactions .",
    "prior to the introduction of the higgs boson and mass terms , the lagrangian is chiral and invariant with respect to any permutation of the left and right quark fields .",
    "the introduction of a higgs boson and the yukawa couplings give mass to the quarks and leptons when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken . the mass term in the lagrangian , obtained by taking the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field in the quark and lepton higgs couplings ,",
    "gives rise to mass matrices @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; @xmath11 therefore , we propose , as well as many other authors  @xcite , that the texture zeroes of the mass matrices of the quarks and leptons , are the result of a flavour permutational symmetry @xmath0 and its spontaneous or explicit breaking .    on the other hand , in the last ten years , important theoretical advances have been made in the understanding of the mechanisms for the mass fermion generation and flavour mixing .",
    "phenomenologically , some striking progress has been made with the help of the texture zeroes and flavour symmetries in specifying the quantitative relationship between flavour mixing angles and quark or lepton mass ratios  @xcite with a minimum of free parameters .",
    "in fact it , can be noted that different mass matrices with texture zeroes located in different positions may have exactly the same physical content .",
    "therefore the question arises , is there any relation between these matrices ? .",
    "we find an answer to this question through the similarity clases , recently proposed by branco  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we use the permutational symmetry @xmath0 as a flavour symmetry , in a unified treatment of masses and mixings of quarks and leptons . also , with the help of a real matrix representation of the group @xmath1 , as a basis for the transformation matrices of the similarity classes , we make a classification of the set of mass matrices with texture zeroes .",
    "a phenomenologically and theoretically meaningful approach for reducing the number of free parameters in the standard model is the imposition of texture zeroes  @xcite or flavour symmetries .",
    "recent flavour symmetry models are reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "also , certain texture zeroes may be obtained from a flavour symmetry . in particular , a permutational @xmath0 flavour symmetry and",
    "its sequential explicit breaking justifies taking the same generic form for the mass matrices of all dirac fermions , conventionally called a four texture zeroes form  @xcite . some reasons to propose the validity of a matrix with four texture zeroes as a universal form for the mass matrices of all dirac fermions in the theory",
    "are the following :    1 .",
    "the idea of @xmath0 flavour symmetry and its explicit breaking has been succesfully realized as a mass matrix with four texture zeroes in the quark sector to interpret the strong mass hierarchy of up and down type quarks  @xcite . also , the numerical values of mixing matrices of the quarks determined in this framework are in good agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "2 .   since the mass spectrum of the charged leptons exhibits a hierarchy similar to the quark s one , it would be natural to consider the same @xmath0 symmetry and its explicit breaking to justify the use of the same generic form with four texture zeroes for the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "3 .   as for the dirac neutrinos",
    ", we have no direct information about the absolute values or the relative values of the dirac neutrino masses , but the mass matrix with four texture zeroes can be obtained from an grand unified theory @xmath12 which describes well the data on masses and mixings of majorana neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from supersymmetry arguments , it would be sensible to assume that the dirac neutrinos have a mass hierarchy similar to that of the u - quarks and it would be natural to take for the dirac neutrino mass matrix also a matrix with four texture zeroes .      some authors have pointed out that realistic dirac fermion mass matrices results from the flavour permutational symmetry @xmath14 and its spontaneous or explicit breaking  @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath0 treats three treats three objects symmetrically , while its @xmath2 representation structure @xmath15 treats the generations differently and adapts itself readily to the hierarchical nature of the mass spectrum . under exact @xmath16 symmetry , the mass spectrum for either quark sector ( up or down quarks ) or leptonic sector ( charged leptons or dirac neutrinos ) consists of one massive particle in a singlet irreducible representation and a pair of massless particles in a doublet irreducible representation",
    ", the corresponding quark mass matrix with the exact @xmath16 symmetry will be denoted by @xmath17 with @xmath18 . here ,",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the up quarks , down quarks , charged leptons and dirac neutrinos , respectively .",
    "assuming that there is only one higgs boson in the theory , this @xmath23 doublet can be accommodated in a singlet representation of @xmath0.in order to generate masses for the first and second families , we add the terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 to @xmath17 .",
    "the term @xmath24 breaks the permutational symmetry @xmath16 down to @xmath26 and mixes the singlet and doublet representation of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath25 transforms as the mixed symmetry term in the doublet complex tensorial representation of @xmath27 .",
    "putting the first family in a complex representation will allow us to have a cp violating phase in the mixing matrix .",

    ", we expect @xmath35 to be very close to unity .",
    "the small parameter @xmath36 is a function of the flavour symmetry breaking parameter @xmath37  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "each possible symmetry breaking pattern is now characterized by the flavour symmetry breaking parameter @xmath37 , which is defined as the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "this ratio measures the mixing of singlet and doublet irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "the mass matrix ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) may be written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a real symmetric matrix and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "in this section we make a classification of mass matrices with texture zeroes in terms of the similarity clases .",
    "the similarity classes are defined as follows : two matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 are similar if there exists an invertible matrix @xmath44 such that @xmath45 the equivalence classes associated with a similarity transformation are called similarity classes .",
    "another way to see the similarity classes is that the matrices that satisfy the similarity transformation , eq .",
    "( [ similar : trans ] ) , have the same invariants ; trace , determinant and @xmath46 : @xmath47 + in this paper we will count the texture zeroes in a matrix as follows : two texture zeroes off- diagonal counts as one zero , while one on the diagonal counts as one zero  @xcite .",
    "but in the literature we find that a mass matrix has double number of texture zeroes than the number that we obtain with our rule .",
    "this is so , because in the literature the total number of texture zeroes counted in a mass matrix is the sum of the texture zeroes coming from the two mass matrices in the sector of quarks ( up and down quarks ) or leptons ( charged leptons and left - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "hence , to avoid confusion in the nomenclature of the matrices , we count the number of texture zeroes in a matrix with the rule previously enunciated , but when referring to this matrix we will follow the literature s rule and name it with the double of texture zeroes it actually has .",
    "+ now , from the most general form of the mass matrices of @xmath2 , symmetric and hermitian : @xmath48 we can see that only six of the nine elements of these matrices are independent of each other .",
    "therefore , in a certain sense the similarity transformation , eq .",
    "( [ similar : trans ] ) , realized the permutation of the six independent elements in the nine entries of the mass matrices .",
    "but if we want to preserve the invariants  ( [ invariantes:1 ] ) , the elements on the diagonal can only exchanged positions on the diagonal , while the off - diagonal elements can only exchange positions outside of the diagonal .",
    "thus we have that all these operations reduce to the permutations of three objects .",
    "so it is natural propose to as transformation matrices @xmath44 in the similarity clases , see  eq.([similar : trans ] ) , the six elements of the real representation of the group of permutations @xmath1 , which are : @xmath49 then , applying the transformations  ( [ similar : trans ] ) and taking the matrices  ( [ base : completa ] ) as matrices of transformation , we get the classification of mass matrices with texture zeroes , which is shown in the tables  1 ,  2 ,  3 and 4 . in this tables , the `` @xmath50 '' and `` @xmath51 '' denote an arbitrary non - vanishing matrix element on the diagonal and off - diagonal entries , respectively .     & & symmetric & hermitian i & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 +     & & symmetric & hermitian i & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + ii & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + iii & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + iv & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 +     & & symmetric & hermitian i & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 + ii & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 + iii & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 + iv & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 +     & & symmetric & hermitian i & @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + ii & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 +",
