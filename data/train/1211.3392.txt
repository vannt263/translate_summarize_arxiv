    "the pulsations are considered to play a role in the deep , irregular brightness declines of up to 8 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "these declines are attributed to clouds of dust ejected from their atmospheres , the evidence for which is an omnipresent ir signature around the star @xcite . such deep declines and ir excesses have not been observed in the otherwise chemically similar hydrogen - deficient carbon ( hdc ) stars or the hotter extreme helium ( ehe ) stars .",
    "other than the declines for which they were first noticed , rcb stars have been an enigma because of their anomalous chemical signatures and the possible evolutionary path ( or paths ) that may have led to their current state .",
    "the surface layers of rcbs are predominantly made of helium ( mass fraction @xmath10=0.98 ) and are carbon rich with c@xmath11n@xmath11o .",

    "this peculiar surface composition is indicative of material processed by h - burning and ( partial ) he - burning .",

    "rcb stars , as a class , have @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios between 1 and 20 @xcite , probably the lowest ones measured anywhere in the universe .",
    "the goal of this work is to construct post - merger models that can reproduce the unique chemical signatures of rcb stars , particularly their low @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios and f enhancements .",
    "the ehe stars have similar compositions ( barring a few exceptions ) as rcb stars , suggesting a common evolutionary origin and link .",
    "the surfaces of ehe stars are too hot to show co bands , therefore their @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios can not be measured . as one of our primary goals in this paper is to model the low @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios seen in rcb stars , we exclude ehe stars from our discussion .",

    "the expected number of rcb stars resulting from the merger of co and he wds is very close to the estimated @xmath18 rcb stars obtained by extrapolating the lmc rcb population @xcite , which implies that only a small fraction has been found so far .",
    "computational models and observational evidence also lean toward the dd model being the more plausible path out of the two scenarios to form rcb stars @xcite .",

    "a 1-d ` cold merger ' model involved mixing different proportions of masses of he and co wds , and a ` hot merger ' model was built by incorporating the results obtained in the sph simulations of he - co wd merger systems by @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the elemental abundances obtained from their mixing recipe , barring those of c , n and o ( and s in the hot merger model ) , fell short of the observed ones in rcb stars , particularly the s - process elements , which were assumed to originate exclusively from the progenitor agb star .",
    "they concluded that even additional nucleosynthesis that may occur during the actual merger of he and co wds can not help to reproduce the observed abundances of rcb stars .    continuing the work by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite ( paper i ) presented grid - based hydrodynamic merger simulations for a range of mass ratios ( @xmath37 ) of co and he wds ( of total mass @xmath38 ) .",

    "single - zone nucleosynthesis calculations using the @xmath39 , @xmath40 conditions of the sof of three cases were made for a range of initial abundance distributions derived from a variety of appropriate agb progenitor models .",
    "those were taken from the nugrid library of detailed post - processed , fully evolved models of solar metallicity that ranged from the early agb to the advanced thermal pulse stage ( set 1.2 , pignatari et al .",
    ", in prep ) . the composition of the he wd was taken to be uniformly mixed and was extracted from a low mass rgb star .",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite , we found that within the dynamic phase , the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratio in the sof was of the order of 1000 .",
    "the difference in the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios between the two simulations may arise from the difference in the total mass considered . in any case , according to our results , the low observed @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios of rcb stars can not originate from the dynamic merger phase , but if the temperature and density conditions were maintained for a longer period of time , then @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios between 4 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) to 30 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) could be obtained .",
    "following the results of paper i , we now explore the the long term post - merger evolution with the goal of identifying conditions under which this evolutionary phase could reconcile the present stark discrepancy between models and observed surface abundance of rcb stars .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that merging wds are considered to be paths to the creation of many other interesting stellar objects , such as type ia supernovae and neutron stars @xcite , sdb stars @xcite , am cvns @xcite and even planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "the rich and detailed observational picture available for rcb and hdc stars gives an opportunity to constrain dd merger and post - merger physics in general , thereby providing a quantitative understanding of the objects mentioned above .",
    "the long term evolution of such merged systems may be characterized by the formation of an accretion disk from the secondary wd @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the post - merger object may undergo a more viscous , star - like evolution with the keplerian rotation in the envelope eventually dying out @xcite .",
    "we follow the latter scenario for the post - merger evolution , and we assume the merged object to evolve as a hybrid c / o - he star undergoing rotation - driven mixing in its envelope . we construct spherically symmetric one - dimensional models of merged wds , with a range of initial conditions and follow their evolution into the domain of the hr diagram where rcb stars are observed to lie . along with convective mixing",
    ", these models also include an induced , continuous mixing profile assumed to result from the rotation of the merger - remnant .",
    "we then perform a multi - zone post - processing nucleosynthesis analysis of these models and compare their surface abundances with those of rcb stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes our simulation methods , where the progenitor evolution of the system , the construction of the initial models , a brief description of the codes we used , the formulation of the mixing profile , and the four post - merger evolution cases that we studied .",
    "this is followed by section  3 , where the stellar and nucleosynthesis processes of the model during its evolution are described and compared with each other and with the rcb star observations .",
    "we close with the discussion and conclusions in section  4 .",
    "the post - merger simulations are building on our previous dynamic merger simulations ( paper i ) .",
    "they involve the construction of appropriate initial models for the post - merger evolution , starting with the abundance profiles that take into account information for all observed species from realistic progenitor models as well as our best estimates of nucleosynthesis in the dynamic merger phase ( i.e.  in the sof ) .",
    "the initial abundance profiles are homologously imposed on a homogeneous zero - age main - sequence model of the same mass , so that within a thermal time scale the stellar structure is determined by and consistent with the post - merger abundance profile .",
    "the stellar evolution of these objects is followed into the rcb region of the hrd , and then post - processed with the same complete nuclear network ( using the nugrid ppn codes ) that has been used to generate the progenitor models . in this way our models take into account nuclear production during the progenitor evolution , the hot merger phase ( paper i ) as well as any production during the post - merger phase , which - as we show here - is essential to reproduce the observed abundances of rcb stars .",
    "the progenitor evolution of a double - degenerate merger evolves from a close binary of low- and intermediate - mass main sequence stars , and involves a common envelope ( ce ) event when the primary becomes a giant star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ce events are expected to have occurred in close binary systems with at least one wd component @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the second ce event is a close binary with co and he wds . this progenitor evolution matters here only in as much as it determines which rgb and agb models should be considered when constructing the initial abundance distribution out of their combined he and co cores , as described in @xcite .",
    "the final merging of the two wds takes place within a dynamic timescale of @xmath45@xmath46 and results in a structure consisting of a co core surrounded by a shock - heated layer and an envelope in keplerian rotation @xcite . in our hydrodynamic simulations reported in paper i , this hot and very dense sof lasted until the end of the simulations .",
    "the sof is the region where nucleosynthesis can occur within the dynamic time scale .",
    "the final nuclear production of the sof will depend on how long it lasts beyond the end of simulations .",
    "the post - merger evolution is determined by the interplay of thermal dissipation , angular momentum transport induced by rotational instabilities and magnetic fields , and the nuclear time scale of h- and he - burning shells .",
    "how these ingredients interact is still uncertain , and with regard to the influence that nuclear burning has on this phase differences may exist depending on the composition of the merging wds .",
    "considering the merger of two co wds the merger has been described as an accretion of the post - merger disk remnant onto the core over a timescale of either @xmath47years @xcite or few hours @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the post - merger object couples the rigid primary wd and the tidally disrupted secondary wd undergoing keplerian rotation through viscous mechanisms ( from magnetohydrodynamic instabilities ) that stimulate transport of angular momentum over a period between @xmath48 and @xmath49 seconds @xcite .",
    "these shearing forces may also increase the peak temperature of the sof / corona of the remnant by a factor of @xmath142 and work on expanding the material to larger radii . @xcite",
    "considered a range of wd combinations including he+co wd mergers .",
    "they show that , towards the end of such a viscous phase , the remnant evolves towards a spherically symmetric , almost shear - free steady state with a thermally - supported envelope in solid body rotation ( although the case with the smallest co to he wd mass ratio shows the largest asymmetries of all cases ) .",
    "these authors expect the subsequent evolution to be star - like , growing into a giant star , with the luminosity from its internal nuclear - burning driving convection in its cool extended envelope .",
    "such evolution represents a path from the merger of white dwarfs to the formation of rcb giant stars .    following the latter scenario , we construct the initial composition profile for our long - term post - merger simulations to be comprised of a co core , an sof , and an envelope with rotationally induced mixing , predominantly made of the former he wd .      the first step in building the internal composition of the post - merged object is to choose the progenitor agb and rgb stars of the co and he wds respectively .",
    "these progenitor models determine when the ce interactions will take place and therefore can not be uniquely determined _ a posteriori_. we consider two out of the three co - wd progenitor models introduced in paper i. accordingly , the co wd is the progeny of either an early - agb ( e - agb ) or advanced - thermal pulse agb ( a - tp agb ) star .",
    "the difference between these progenitors is in the amount of s - process elements in the outer layers of the co wd ] , as well as the thickness of the he - rich layer . in both cases",
    ", the co wd has a h - rich envelope of the order of @xmath50@xmath51 .",
    "the rgb model for the he wd has a more massive h - rich envelope of @xmath7@xmath52@xmath51 .",
    "these wd mass dependent amounts of h have been chosen according to stellar evolution simulation results ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig.8 , paper i ) and play - as we will show - an important role in reproducing both the cno elemental abundances as well as providing for the formation of the neutron source isotope @xmath25 .",

    ", a certain fraction of mass ( @xmath54 ) is dredged up from the co wd ( @xmath55 ) and mixed with the he wd ( @xmath56 ) material in the envelope .",

    "is pulled up to the envelope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig.11 of paper i ) , an equal mass of he wd makes its way into the co wd .",
    "thus a partially mixed zone is formed between the two wds .",
    "a major portion of the mass in this zone is occupied by the sof ( @xmath59 ) , while the rest is in the buffer zone between the core and the sof ( @xmath60 ) . a small fraction of the mass @xmath61 from the he wd ( that penetrates the co wd and forms the partial mixing zone ) resides in the sof ( @xmath62 ) , while a larger part finds itself located in the buffer zone .    the initial sof composition is thus dominated by the mass dredged up from the co wd ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "as in paper i , we assume that the exchange of masses during the dynamic merger phase occurs before the onset of burning in any given layer .",
    "correspondingly , the sof layer is subjected to nuclear processing according to the conditions in the sof derived from the merger calculations ( see section  [ sec : cases ] for two cases considered for sof processing ) .",
    "the result of this nuclear processing is then entered into the post - merger abundance profile .",

    "the isotopic abundances of that zone are averaged over its mass .",
    "the key parameters of the post - merger models are the pre - merger wd mass ratio , the amount of dynamic dredge - up from the co wd , the type of co - wd progenitor model , and the temperature and duration of the sof nuclear burning in the dynamic phase .",
    "we focus here on four representative combinations of these parameters .",
    "the dynamic merger simulations predict dredge - up depths ranging from 15% to 18% of mass into the co wd for the three low-@xmath37 cases . in the outer layers of the he - free",

    "if material is dredged up from these layers the star becomes more enhanced in oxygen than in carbon at its surface , which is not observed in rcb stars .",
    "the other problem of dredging up high amounts of oxygen is that the star would have much higher @xmath15 ratios than observed in rcb stars , even when post - merger nucleosynthesis effects are taken into account ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid an excessive surface enrichment in @xmath5 , the adopted mass of dredge - up from the chosen co wd models is lower than the values obtained in the hydrodynamic simulations .",

    "this choice may seem odd , since the irregular dust - ejections associated with the unusual c dominated surface composition represent a defining property of rcb stars . however , with our one - dimensional simulation approach for the post - merger phase we can not hope in any case to reproduce the irregular , and most likely aspherical mass ejection and dust formation processes . in our stellar evolution simulations",
    "mass loss is therefore only imposed via the blcker formula with an efficiency parameter choosen to obtain an order of magnitude appropriate mass loss rate .",
    "therefore , our choice of opacity will only have minor effects on the stellar temperature during the rcb phase .",
    "indeed , individual test runs with type ii opacities evolve to lower temperatures than their type i counterparts , but the nucleosynthesis and mixing evolution is in both cases the same .",

    "the reaction chain @xmath186 followed by @xmath187 further reduces ca and in the process increases the amount of ti .    from fig.[x_rcb ] , the range of na values from our models is consistent with the data trend , while those of al are in marginal agreement with the enrichment levels seen in rcbs .",
    "since there are only 6 stars which have mg measured and as they are well scattered , it is difficult to draw out a trend in this element ; we only barely get the upper limits and do not get the decrements , as seen in two of those stars .",
    "upper limits are also closely achieved in ti and ca , while our lower limits do not reach down to those found in some rcbs .",
    "ca is seen to be enriched in a few rcb stars with the lowest [ fe ] , which none of our models show .",
    "likewise , si and s hardly change in all four cases , as temperatures are not hot enough to produce them in the initial sof or in the star itself .",
    "thus our models do not show the overabundances of si and s observed in rcb stars with the lowest [ fe ] ( see discussion in section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "[ [ s - process - elements ] ] s - process elements : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the abundances of s - process nuclei depend on the seed fe nuclei available in the star .",
    "although the neutron source is primary , the main neutron poison is also primary , and therefore the s  process is secondary .",
    "thus , one would expect [ x ] of s - process elements to rise more or less in sync with [ fe ] .    among our simulations",
    "the low-@xmath37 case with a high-@xmath39 sof ( case 4 ) shows enhanced abundances of s - process elements from the neutron flux available during the post - merger evolution phase ( section  [ sec : sof ] ) , while the high-@xmath37 case with low-@xmath39 and long sof ( case 2 ) produce the s - process elements in the sof before the post - merger evolution ( section  [ sec : sproc - pmerg ] ) .",
    "cases 1 and 3 produce only small amounts of s - process elements .    with few exceptions",
    "almost all rcb stars show some enhancement in s - process elements on their surface , compared to the solar - scaled abundance level .",
    "the observed range of enhancements agrees with the range of our four cases , except for a few stars that seem to be depleted in s - process elements .",
    "our post - merger models are based on realistic progenitor evolutions with complete nucleosynthesis predictions and the dynamic merger history presented in paper i. these models adopt an envelope mixing model that is motivated by the rotation of the merged object . with these assumptions",
    "the models reproduce almost all the observed characteristics of rcb stars , in particular the anomalous isotopic signatures of o , as well as c and the f enhancements .",
    "model predictions are also in good agreement with the observed abundances of s - process elements .",
    "these do not originate in the progenitor agb star . depending on the mass ratio of the merging wds the s process originates either in the sof , which is a characteristic of the dynamic phase ( case 2 ) or in the post - merger phase ( case 4 ) . in the former case s - process enhancements",
    "are only seen if the sof is assumed to persist for more than @xmath188 ( long sof ) .",
    "the enhancements of c , n , o and f are due to nucleosynthesis in the post - merger evolution of the star .",
    "the initial abundances constructed from the progenitor agb and rgb models are important with respect to the amount of h available , and the profile of c and o into which dynamic and post - merger dredge - up mixing may reach . the amount of h is chosen according to predictions of stellar evolution calculations of the giant to white dwarf transition ( paper i ) , and it provides the protons for the neutron source isotope @xmath25 .",
    "being of the order of 0.001 is required to obtain the observed cno elemental values of rcbs .",
    "lower than this order of h , would cause the @xmath79 abundance to drop , and @xmath189 while higher than this causes @xmath79 to rise above o at the surface , leading to @xmath189 .",
    "the majority of rcbs have @xmath190 at the surface .",
    "the cno ratios will also depend on the abundance ratios in the outer layer of the progenitor agb stars core , and despite adopting a range of progenitor agb models , we find that the c , n , and o abundances are similar for all cases .",
    "our models also lie within the observed range of luminosity and effective temperature of rcb stars .",
    "the differences between the surface abundances when the models enter and leave the rcb phase are @xmath191 for c , n , o , and f , and @xmath192 for the other nuclear species ( this is less than the observational errors ) .",
    "thus , our models can also account for the four hot rcb stars between @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the models show a range of @xmath195 and f in agreement with observations and their @xmath178 ratios are higher than the observed lower limit for rcb stars .",
    "the model parameters are constrained by the diverse range of observational properties .",
    "in addition to the depth of mixing during he - shell burning phase of the post - merger evolution ( @xmath102 ) , the mixing limit @xmath90 depends on the agb progenitor . for an advanced agb progenitor model the depth of mixing",
    "must be limited to avoid an excessive @xmath196 dredge - up to the surface since the outer layers of the evolving agb co - core get increasingly o - rich .",
    "other parameters of the mixing model ( section  [ sec : mixing ] ) calibrated to reproduce the observed surface abundances are the width of the partially mixed region below the proper mixing regime in the envelope and the efficiency of mixing .",
    "the former needs to be large enough to produce enough f but small enough to avoid destruction of @xmath197 .",
    "the latter must be large enough to mix enough @xmath197 to the surface but small enough to avoid contamination with @xmath196 .",
    "surface abundances are also determined by the sof properties , which are mostly a result of the mass ratio of the merging wds .",
    "the duration of conditions for nucleosynthesis in the sof is uncertain and has been approximated by assuming two cases , a long and short sof . finally , our models suggest that the adopted additional envelope mixing should subside just before the rcb star phase is reached .",
    "without such a decrease of mixing efficiency with time , continuous mixing throughout the evolution of the star causes the star to become o - rich as against being c - rich .",
    "although in the end the choice of parameters ( progenitor model , sof assumptions , mixing model ) appears to have a lot of parameters , it turns out that all of these seem to be identifiable with unique nucleosynthetic and mixing signatures . due to large number of nucleosynthesis processes , each with their individual dependence on temperature and on other , related nucleosynthesis processes ( as for example the neutron production and consumption for the f production )",
    ", most of these parameters are therefore well constrained in our models .",
    "a legitimate question would be how degenerate our solutions are . in view of the many cases that we have investigated , many of them not described in detail in this paper , we are not aware of any alternative way to arrive at such a level of agreement between observations and models . however , one has to admit that significant uncertainties , especially regarding the properties and evolution of the sof as well as non - spherically symmetric aspects of the post - merger mixing model remain .",
    "observations of rcb stars show some diversity and our four cases reproduce a spread in abundance features .",
    "most of this spread in model predictions is in fact due to differences in the cases , such as the mass ratio of the wds , or the progenitor model , which represent a real source of diversity corresponding to the range of wd mergers that are expected to end up as rcb or hdc stars .    when comparing observations and model prediction it must be kept in mind that dust depletion may play a role @xcite , since after all the irregular variability of rcb stars",
    "is associated with dust enshrouding .",
    "this possibility can not be ruled out , in particular to explain the distinctly low [ fe ] values of the minority rcbs from the majority .",
    "it does not appear that the dust - gas separation in rcb stars .",
    "an ism - like dust depletion can explain the high [ s / fe ] and [ na / fe ] observed in rcbs , but not their [ al / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] values , both of which are much lower in the ism . in particular , the si in a carbon - rich dust environment is expected to condense into sic grains , thus severely reducing the si content .",
    "however all rcbs have high [ si / fe ] ratios .",
    "it should be noted however , that only amorphous graphite grains and no sic grains have been detected in rcbs .",
    "this maybe indicative of a different dust - gas separation mechanism from that of the ism .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the large si and s overabundances seen in the rcb stars with the lowest [ fe ] considers the mass of the merging wds .",
    "si and s are produced in o burning at @xmath198k , which could be achieved in the sof of a merger of more massive wds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath199 for combined mass @xmath200 ) .",
    "the theoretical initial - final mass relationship predicts , for a given initial mass , higher wd masses for lower metallicity @xcite . assuming the initial mass function does not depend on metallicity in the range relevant for rcb star progenitors , higher wd masses are expected for lower metallicity mergers , and this may be the reason for the larger enhancements in s and si for the rcb stars with the lowest fe content .",
    "such higher - mass rcb stars would naturally also be more luminous , and this hypothesis therefore predicts that rcb star luminosity is correlated with si and s enhancements .    on a preliminary note , we do see enhancements of @xmath21 on the surface of our models that seem to agree with the levels of @xmath201 found in ehes .",
    "a detailed comparison of our models with the observations of ehe is , however , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "finally , a few exceptions to the usual rcb star properties include those with higher than average h , including four rcb stars in which li is enhanced @xcite , as well as four other rcbs that have a relatively higher amount of @xmath13c at their surface @xcite , with @xmath12c/@xmath13c@xmath202 .",
    "neither of these properties are found in our models .",
    "recent sph simulation results of @xcite indicate that , to be preserved , any li that maybe produced in a dd merger will have to be ejected into the mass that forms clouds around the rcb star .",
    "since mass - ejection during the dynamic merger phase is not part of the hydrodynamic simulations of paper i , our models can not predict lithium abundances from such a scenario .",
    "thus , the question of whether li - rich rcbs are an outcome of the ff scenario or of the merger between wds remains open and needs a separate , more in - depth analysis .",
