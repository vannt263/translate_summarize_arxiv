    "the nuclear regions of active galaxies can harbor different energetic phenomena such as starbursts ( sbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which are responsible for producing the bright emission stemming from their central regions .",
    "the heating of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in nuclei with different type of activity is expected to be dominated by a variety of mechanisms , such as uv , x - rays , and/or shocks , which will ultimately drive their observed chemical richness ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . disentangling which of this mechanisms is the main power source of galactic nuclei",
    "is complicated by the high obscuration affecting these objects .",
    "this fact becomes critical in the case of ultra luminous galaxies ( ulirgs ) and high - z sources .",
    "therefore the observation of the dense molecular material has become an essential tool to get an insight in the evolution and classification of the nuclear activity in galaxies .",
    "finding appropriate molecular species to accurately trace each of these heating mechanisms is crucial to stablish the nature of the central engine .",
    "molecular species like hcn and hco@xmath4 , and in particular the ratios hcn / co and hcn / hco@xmath4 , have been claimed to be appropriate to differentiate between the sb and the agn contribution in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "similarly , species such as hnc and cn are thought to show enhanced abundances in extremely irradiated environments @xcite .",
    "a dichotomy still remains concerning the different evolutionary state of nuclear starburst .",
    "while at an early stage , the heating of the ism is thought to be dominated by shocks affecting the molecular clouds fueling the starburst , the late stages of starburst are vastly dominated by the uv radiation originated in the newly formed massive stars .",
    "this scenario has been inferred from the extensive observation of the prototype sources ngc253 and m82 in a number of key molecular tracers such as so@xmath5 , h@xmath5s , ocs @xcite , hoc@xmath4 , and co@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these tracers are generally too faint to be detected , but for the brightest prototypical nearby galaxies .    in a recent observational study carried out towards a sample of molecular clouds dominated by different heating mechanisms within the galactic center region @xcite",
    ", we have found that the cs / hnco abundance ratio is highly contrasted between molecular clouds illuminated by the uv radiation from massive star clusters and the giant molecular cloud complexes shielded from photodissociation and mostly heated by shocks .",
    "the origin of the large changes in the cs / hnco ratio is due to the enhancement of cs in photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) through reactions involving s@xmath4 @xcite as opposed to the highly photodissociable hnco , which is destroyed by the uv photons .",
    "both observations of photodissociation regions within our galaxy and photochemical models show the suitability of cs as a pdr tracer @xcite .",
    "in addition , hnco is enhanced in the presence of shocks due to its injection in the gas phase from the grain mantles @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a follow up study of the cs / hnco ratio towards a sample of prototype galaxies with different nuclear activity .",
    "although cs has been extensively observed in external galaxies @xcite , hnco had only been detected in four galaxies prior to this work @xcite .",
    "observations were carried out with the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta , spain , during three observing periods from summer 2005 through summer 2007 .",
    "table  [ tab : sourceandlines ] shows the sample of galaxies with their coordinates and the rest frequencies of the observed molecular transitions .",
    "observations were performed in symmetrical wobbler switched mode with a frequency of 0.5hz and a beam throw of @xmath6 in azimuth . as spectrometers we used the @xmath7mhz filter banks for the 3 mm transitions and the @xmath8mhz filter banks for those at 2 and 1.3 mm .",
    "pointing accuracy was estimated to be of @xmath9 from frequent continuum cross scans on nearby pointing sources .",
    "data were calibrated using the standard dual load system and main beam temperatures were obtained as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is tabulated in table  [ tab : sourceandlines ] and @xmath12 are 0.95 , 0.93 , and 0.91 for 3 , 2 , and 1.2 mm , respectively .",

    "for some of the sources with the larger observed linewidths , the hnco and c@xmath1o lines appear moderately blended . such is the case of ngc7469 , ngc1068 , and arp220 .",
    "gaussian shapes have been fitted to the observed profiles .",
    "table  [ tab.gaussfit ] compiles the derived fitted parameters . for the non - detected transitions ,",
    "upper limits are tabulated where it was considered a @xmath18 level and an approximate linewidth similar to those of the detected cs and hnco transitions , or that of c@xmath1o in the case of ngc5194 .",
    "rotational temperatures and molecular column densities have been derived assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and optically thin emission .",
    "as derived for cs @xmath19 in ngc253 @xcite we only might expect the emission of cs @xmath20 to be significantly optically thick . however , our observation of c34s will be less affected by the opacity effects .",
    "we have accounted for the dilution of the source in the telescope beam by assuming an averaged emission extent of @xmath21 for all sources .",
    "this simplification might affect the determination of the column densities for sources much smaller than @xmath21 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the abundance ratios between species dealt with in this paper ( sect .",
    "[ sec.csvshnco ] ) will not be significantly affected .",
    "thus , the main source of uncertainty will be due to possible different emission extents between molecules .",
    "table  [ tab.coldens ] shows the column density and rotational temperature derived for every source and species . from the lte analysis , we derive c@xmath1o rotational temperatures ( @xmath22 ) of @xmath23k for most of the galaxies except for m82 where we determine @xmath22=15k .",
    "the temperatures derived from the hnco line emission of @xmath24k are a factor of @xmath25 higher than those derived from c@xmath1o .",
    "whenever only one transition was observed , the average rotational temperature of 10k was assumed .",
    "we have also included the available observations towards ngc253 to derive its physical parameters shown in table  [ tab.coldens ] @xcite .",

    "not all sources in the sample were observed in the cs @xmath20 transition . the upper limit to the emission to this transition in ngc6946 @xcite allows to constrain the cs column density to @xmath27 .",
    "we have thus used the cs @xmath19 transitions available on ngc6946 and ngc5194 @xcite to estimate the column densities presented in table  [ tab.coldens ] . note that for ngc6946 we used the observed offset ( @xmath28 ) position in @xcite , which is located just @xmath29 away from our nominal position .",
    "similarly , their ngc5194 ( @xmath30 ) position is @xmath31 away from our observed position .",
    "the critical densities for cs and hnco transitions observed in this works are expected to be very similar since the einstein coefficients and collisional cross sections are estimated to be similar @xcite .",
    "thus , the hnco / cs ratio should reflect a reliable abundances ratio . in any case",
    ", the possible uncertainties introduced by slightly different critical densities will never account for the large difference in the abundance ratios measured in different galaxies .",
    "the differences in the derived molecular abundances might also be affected by molecular excitation differences of each individual source .",
    "however the detailed multitransition study and lvg modeling of dense gas tracers such as hcn and hco+ in a sample of galaxies by @xcite , shows how for several molecular transitions with similar critical densities , the derived abundances from the line intensities are really determined by real differences in abundances and not by excitation effects .",
    "the low excitation temperatures derived from c@xmath1o indicates that a substantial fraction of the column density will be dominated by relatively low density gas . since in our diagnostic diagrams in fig .",

    "we did not observe the central position towards m82 , but a position in the north - east molecular complex ( hereafter m82@xmath34 ) where most of the photodissociation regions are located as observed in the hco emission high - resolution maps @xcite .",

    "the agn is enclosed by a circumnuclear starburst ring with @xmath35 ( @xmath36kpc ) radius @xcite .",

    ", located just in one of the arms of the minispiral .",
    "we have derived the abundances of cs , c@xmath0s , and hnco relative to h@xmath5 . in order to estimate the h@xmath5 column density we have used the observed c@xmath1o emission , assuming a @xmath49o/@xmath1o abundance ratio of 150 , as derived in ngc253 @xcite and the standard co / h@xmath5 ratio of @xmath50 .",
    "the cs fractional abundance shows a narrow range of values within @xmath51 .",
    "similarly the c@xmath0s abundances are concentrated in the range of @xmath52 .",
    "there are only three exceptions to this trend , namely ic342@xmath34 , arp220 , and ngc5194 .",
    "the abundances of cs observed towards ic342@xmath34 is a factor of 6 below the average in the sample , while the c@xmath0s abundance is close to the average value .",
    "this is explained by the highly concentrated cs emission towards the nuclear region @xcite and the almost twice smaller beam size at the cs@xmath14 transition frequency compared to that at the c@xmath0s@xmath53 line ( see table  [ tab : sourceandlines ] ) .",
    "we did not detect neither cs nor c@xmath0s emission towards ngc5194 . while the c@xmath0s upper limit is still within",
    "the average value obtained for the other galaxies , the limit we derive in the main isotopologue is a factor of 3 below the sample average . on the other hand ,",
    "the galaxy arp220 is observed to have an abundance a factor of @xmath54 over the average in both isotopologues .",
    "this points out a real overabundance of cs towards this ulirg .",
    "[ fig.csc34s ] shows the c@xmath2s / c@xmath0s abundance ratio versus the fractional abundance of cs .",
    "this ratio is calculated with the 1 mm cs @xmath14 and the 2 mm c@xmath0 @xmath53 transitions which makes it dependent on the assumed rotational temperature to derive the column densities , and to a lesser extent ( up to a 30% for the smallest sources ) on the considered source size .",
    "however , the ratio derived for ngc4945 and ngc253 agree within a factor of 1.5 with the values derived from the complete study of cs by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "although the effects of line opacity have not been taken into account , we can consider the derived c@xmath2s / c@xmath0s abundance ratio as a rough representation of the @xmath55s isotopic ratio .",
    "it appears that almost all the sources in the sample have ratios around @xmath3 , in agreement with those previously derived for ngc4945 and ngc253 , and well below the value of @xmath56 measured in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "this result supports the idea of an @xmath0s overproduction in the nuclei of galaxies by massive stars .",
    "furthermore , we observe this ratio to be independent of the type of nuclear activity , both in agn and sb dominated galaxies .      in fig .",
    "[ fig.cshnco ] , we represent the fractional abundances of cs and c@xmath0s versus those of hnco .",
    "we observe that most of the galaxies in the sample are observed with hnco fractional abundances ranging from 10@xmath57 to 10@xmath58 , but for two sources , namely ngc5194 and m82 , showing remarkable low hnco abundances .",
    "for these sources we derived fractional abundance below the average derived from the rest of galaxies in our sample by a factor of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we do not observe major differences in the derived abundances among the agns and sbgs in our sample .",
    "this homogeneity suggests that the type of nuclear activity does not play a major role at large scales in the production / destruction of these species in the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "this effect is illustrated by the two positions observed in ngc1068 , where the hnco and @xmath0cs abundances decrease by less than a factor of two from the nuclear agn to the sb ring .",
    "of course we have to bear in mind that the two regions are not fully resolved by the beam of the iram 30 m telescope at these frequencies .",
    "if , as suggested by the observations in the galactic center region @xcite , the abundance of these species is mostly driven by the presence of shocks and strong uv radiation fields in the ism , then the observed differences are likely linked to star formation activity in these galaxies .",
    "significant differences are observed within the galaxies ic342 and maffei2 . in ic342 , the hnco / c@xmath1o ratio increases towards the position in the minispiral and decreases in the central region where ism is illuminated by the uv radiation from the central clusters .",
    "these chemical differences , smoothed to the @xmath61 single - dish beam size , are much more contrasted in the high - resolution interferometric maps by @xcite . although not spatially , we resolve the nuclear region of maffei2 by the two velocity components . as seen from the high - resolution maps of @xmath62co @xcite the lower velocity component ( @xmath63kms@xmath43 )",
    "is associated to the nuclear and northeastern molecular arm , while the higher velocity component ( 0kms@xmath43 ) will be mostly associated to the nuclear and southwest molecular arm .",
    "we clearly see a difference in the chemistry of both components with an increase of the hnco abundance towards the southwest molecular arm of a factor of @xmath64 as well as a decrease of the cs abundance of a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "overall , the hnco / cs ratio increases by almost an order of magnitude",
    ".    we can compare the ratios measured in galaxies with the abundances derived in the central region of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies show hnco abundances intermediate between those found in the shock dominated giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and the galactic pdr prototypes ( see dashed lines in fig  [ fig.cshnco ] ) .",
    "two sources in our sample , namely m83 and ic342@xmath34 clearly fall in the range of abundances found in gmcs . on the contrary",
    ", m82 represents the other extreme where hnco emission is utterly vanished . the upper limit to the detection derived after a deep 5.5 hours integration on the hnco @xmath14 is an order of magnitude lower than the previous limit to the detection in the central position @xcite , but still hnco remains undetected .",
    "interferometric maps with the bima array shows no emission anywhere in the nuclear region of m82 @xcite .",
    "this non - detection of hnco supports the idea that m82 is highly pervaded by a strong uv photodissociating radiation and depleted of dense molecular as also suggested by the low abundance of ch@xmath33oh and nh@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we would expect to observe a higher abundance of cs in this ne position where photodissociation is claimed to be dominant @xcite .",
    "however , we observe just a slightly higher cs abundance than in the whole sample , and not even that if we consider the isotopologue c@xmath0s . altogether with m82 ,",
    "the upper limit to the hnco abundance derived for ngc5194 are similar to those derived in the galactic center pdrs .",
    "most of the molecular studies of ngc5194 so far are restricted to the emission of co and hcn ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the results from this work point out the possible similarities between the chemistries of ngc5194 and m82 , both with very low abundances of hnco as compared with the rest of galaxies in this sample .",
    "this result agrees with the idea of ngc5194 being in a post starburst stage after the star formation event triggered by its interaction with ngc5195 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the hnco and cs abundances in ngc253 and ngc1068@xmath34 , a factor of 3 below the average , as well as the significantly high c@xmath0s abundance , could be explained by photodissociation .",
    "this would suggest that the uv radiation from the evolved sb plays a significant role in the chemistry of the nuclear ism in these galaxies .",
    "therefore ngc253 would contain a significant pdr molecular component , similar to what is observed in m82 . however , the amounts of dense molecular gas shielded from the uv radiation is still one order of magnitude larger than that observed in m82 .",
    "our observations of hnco confirm that this molecule is one of the best tracers to study the evolutionary state of nuclear starbursts in galaxies because of the high contrast shown between the uv pervaded evolved starbursts and the dense and well shielded molecular material in the early stages of star formation .",
    "this molecule shows a higher abundance variation in galaxies than other dense molecular gas tracer such as methanol @xcite . on the other hand , cs",
    "does not show a significant variation among the observed sources .",
    "this might be due to the fact of cs is not only enhanced in regions with strong uv radiation , but its emission also increases towards the densest molecular cores due to its high critical density .",
    "it is interesting to note that the similar fuv field derived by @xcite towards the nucleus of m83 and ngc5194 might explain the different abundances observed in our sample mostly as a consequence of the dense molecular fuel depletion and the molecular cloud structure in their nuclei , and not so much by the differences in the photodissociation fields affecting the nuclear ism .",
    "however , the cs variations in the galactic center clouds are more moderate ( a factor of @xmath66 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than those of hnco , and therefore it is likely to be averaged out over the central several hundred parsecs covered by the single dish beam .",
    "the highly contrasted variation of hnco abundances over the galaxy sample in this work allows us to trace the dense molecular gas available for fueling the nuclear starburst of these galaxies .",
    "this is equivalent to defining a chemical timeline in the evolution of the starburst event that could be read from right to left hand side in fig .",
    "[ fig.cshnco ] .",
    "it is important to note that the time scales for the chemical processess due to shocks and photodissociation by uv radiation ( @xmath67yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are extremely short as compared with the typical time scale of the starburst phenomenon ( @xmath68yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this scenario , at the onset of the starburst ,",
    "large amounts of dense molecular material are driven and compressed into the nuclear region of the galaxy unleashing the star formation .",
    "high abundances of hnco are injected into the gas - phase within these clouds due to shocks , likely as a consequence of the cloud - cloud collisions , as observed in the nuclear spiral arms of ic342 @xcite . from our galaxy sample",
    ", m83 is shown to have the highest abundances of hnco , and similar to those observed in the galactic center gmcs .",
    "subsequently , as soon as the first newly massive star clusters are formed , uv illumination begins to come on stage , photodissociating the material surrounding them .",
    "the hnco abundance in these regions will be quickly dissociated where the cs molecule will be formed .",
    "a sort of average equilibrium will be reached between the pdr and the dense gas contribution as long as the infall of molecular fuel keeps feeding the starburst .",
    "this is the status in which most of the starburst galaxies in our sample are observed .",
    "the agn dominated galaxies we have observed also show this average cs / hnco abundances similar to the intermediate state starbursts , suggesting the presence of a significant uv radiation field .",
    "once the galaxy gets closer to the end the short few 10myr starburst period , the fuel supply is cut off or stopped by superwinds . from our comparative study , this is apparently the point at which ngc253 stands , where photodissociation becomes more important and the fuel reservoir is being consumed by the last gasp of star formation .",
    "finally , as we observe in m82 and ngc5194 , most of the molecular gas is pervaded by the uv radiation field with barely no dense uv shielded molecular material left .",
    "the galaxy remains then waiting for a likely next burst of star formation @xcite .",
    "indeed , chemical enrichment in m82 points out to recursive starburst periods @xcite .",
    "from our study of the cs and hnco abundances in a selected sample of extragalactic sources , we have found differences of nearly two orders of magnitude in the hnco / cs abundance ratios among the starburst galaxies .",
    "these differences are in agreement with the results from the observations of galactic center clouds dominated by various heating mechanisms suggesting that the observed hnco abundances could be related to the evolutionary stage of their nuclear starburst .",
    "shocks affecting the massive dense molecular clouds in the early stages and strong uv fields in the evolved stages dominate the hnco abundance in galaxies .",
    "we do not find significant differences in the molecular abundances of hnco in galaxies with different type of nuclear activity ( i.e. agn or sb ) which implies this species are not affected differently by these processes at the scales observed by single dish beam telescopes .",
    "as derived from the hnco abundances we can point out prototypes of these nuclear starburst evolutionary stages .",
    "m83 and the nuclear spiral arms in ic342 would be representative of the early stage , while m82 and ngc5194 nuclei would be in the later stages of evolution . ngc253 , claimed to be a prototype of early starburst , shows abundances below the average suggesting an important influence of photodissociation in the heating of its ism , and therefore chemically closer to m82 than to m83 .",
    "the @xmath2s/@xmath0s isotopic ratio , derived from the c@xmath2s / c@xmath0s abundance ratio , is found to be @xmath3 , and thus similar for all the observed sources .",
    "this ratio , found to be well below the value of @xmath69 in the galactic disk , supports the idea of the @xmath0s isotope being enriched due to massive star formation events in the nuclear region of galaxies .",
    "the cs emission is suggested to be a good tracer of the molecular gas affected by photodissociation in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we do not observe a significant contrast in our sample .",
    "though its abundance is enhanced in uv radiated regions , its emission is also favored in high density molecular clouds .",
    "thus the overall emission over the central few hundred parsecs of galactic nuclei is averaged out , and no significant trends in the cs abundances is found in the observed galaxies .",
