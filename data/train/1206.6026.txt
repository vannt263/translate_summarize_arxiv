    "the last two decades have witnessed a phenomenal increase of the available cosmological data . analyzed in the framework of an flrw homogeneous cosmology , they have yielded the concordance model where more than 95% of the universe content is of unknown nature . among these 95% , around 75% of the universe energy density",
    "is ascribed to the influence of some rather exotic component called dark energy .",
    "but dark energy has never been directly observed neither in the universe , nor in laboratories , and it has very exotic properties , namely , it is a kind of fluid with negative pressure or a cosmological constant with an amplitude too small to account for the vacuum energy in the current standard model of particle physics .",
    "this has led some authors to studying whether the observations could not be given a more natural explanation in the framework of inhomogeneous models constructed with exact solutions of einstein s field equations without any dark energy component .",
    "the models most often found in the literature are roughly of two kinds : one patch large scale inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) models , spherically symmetric around the observer @xcite , and swiss - cheese models in which the patches can be either spherically symmetric ltb holes @xcite or non spherical szekeres patches @xcite .    since the ltb solutions are determined by two free functions of the radial coordinate plus a radial coordinate choice , two independent sets of data",
    "are necessary and sufficient to define them , e.g. angular distance and galaxy number counts @xcite . in the most recent works devoted to solve the dark energy problem with zero-@xmath0 ltb models ,",
    "such solutions have been constrained by two or more sets of data measured on our past light cone @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . by construction",
    ", we are thus left with a degeneracy as regards the @xmath0cdm model , because in both cases , homogeneous and inhomogeneous cosmology , the same data are reproduced without the possibility to discriminate between the models . however , it has been suggested that this degeneracy can only occur if the ltb model is not smooth at the center ; otherwise , the models are distinguishable @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy is even worse , when a few independent data sets are used , for models constructed with szekeres solutions which are determined by five free functions of the radial coordinate plus a radial coordinate choice in the most general case . even if this number can be reduced to three in the case of axial symmetry , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , the mere supernova data used to constrain the models in @xcite is far from being sufficient for fully determining them .",
    "this is the reason why tests using the redshift - drift have been recently proposed to deal with this issue .",
    "the redshift - drift is the temporal variation of the redshift of distant sources when the observation of the same source is done at observer s different proper times in an expanding universe .",
    "it allows one to make observations on the past light cones of an observer at different cosmological times , therefore giving access to a slice of space - time .",
    "it is thus a good discriminator between different cosmological models able to reproduce the observational data on our current past light cone .",
    "this effect has first been considered by sandage @xcite , then by mcvittie @xcite . in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw )",
    "models , when the universe expansion decelerates , all redshifts decrease with time . in flrw models",
    "where the expansion is recently accelerating , like in the @xmath0cdm model , sources with redshifts @xmath1 exhibit a positive redshift - drift . in @xcite",
    "this effect has been proposed to test the `` copernican principle '' and to close the reconstruction problem of an ltb model from the luminosity distance as inferred from the supernova data .",
    "other authors have since examined this effect for one patch zero-@xmath0 ltb models @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this effect is the only currently proposed one able to test , in principle , the ltb one patch models against the @xmath0cdm model `` outside the past light cone '' , provided spherical symmetry is but a mathematical simplification and one considers ltb models as exhibiting an energy density smoothed out over angles around us . however",
    ", other proposals designed to test specific ltb models considered as a single exact spacetime and relying on conditions inside the observer s light cone can be found in the literature , e.g. tests using the bao scale @xcite , the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite or the compton y - distortion of the cmb spectrum @xcite .    here , we want to study the redshift - drift in swiss - cheese models which seem to represent more closely our observed universe with its voids and filamentary patterns .    for voids ,",
    "the spherically symmetric shape of the holes can be considered as a good approximation since non spherical voids evolve towards a spherical configuration .",
    "actually , it has been shown , using the top - hat void model , that the smaller axis of an underdense ellipsoid stretches out faster than the longer one implying that voids become increasingly spherical as they evolve @xcite .",
    "conversely , overdense ellipsoids tend to form pancakes and filamentary structures which are what we observe in the universe .",
    "this is the reason why we choose to study a swiss - cheese with non spherically symmetric overdense patches .",
    "an inhomogeneous exact solution of general relativity with no symmetry at all ( no killing vector ) is the szekeres model @xcite . among its sub - classes ,",
    "the quasi - spherical szekeres ( qss ) case is best suited for our purpose since it possesses all three flrw classes of models as an homogeneous limit and can therefore be matched to any kind of flrw background .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that in a general szekeres model , generic light rays do not have repeatable paths ( rlps ) , i.e. two rays sent from the same source at different times to the same observer do not proceed through the same succession of intermediate matter particles , implying thus an angular drift of the source on the sky .",
    "this implies that , in such models , the light rays emitted from a source at different time coordinates are emitted in different directions and therefore reach different loci at the border of each patch .",
    "since we integrate the null geodesic and redshift - drift equations for a sequence of such different time coordinates for each source , i.e. for each redshift @xmath2 , this makes impossible the choice of the locus of the matching between two patches and thus impairs the construction of swiss - cheese models .",
    "there are only two szekeres classes , besides flrw models , where rlps exist , the most interesting for our purpose being the axially symmetric szekeres models , in which the rlps are the null geodesics intersecting every space of constant time on the axis of symmetry .",
    "actually , such a class of models have been used in @xcite ( hereafter bc ) to construct qss swiss - cheeses which can reproduce the supernova data .",
    "the model which we consider here is bc s model 5 which best reproduces these data and which is a model with overdense patches matched to a open flrw background . in this model ,",
    "the observer is located at the origin of the first patch and the sources , at redshifts ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , can be anywhere on null geodesics axially directed towards the observer .",
    "of course , this swiss - cheese model must be still considered as a very simplified toy - model since axial symmetry is not a generic property of structures in the observed universe .",
    "anyhow , it is important to compute the redshift - drift in such configurations and to compare it to the results in the @xmath0cdm model and other ltb models .",
    "inhomogeneous exact models have been sometimes criticized on the ground that they exhibit more degrees of freedom than flrw models and are thus able to fit more easily the data .",
    "another interesting question to be addressed is therefore : how many independent data sets do we need to fully reconstruct an axially symmetric qss model ?",
    "it has already been shown in @xcite that the combination of luminosity distance and redshift - drift data allows one to fully constrain a spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "this applies , in particular , to ltb models .",
    "it has also been shown in @xcite that , for any given isotropic observations of the apparent luminosity @xmath5 and of the galaxy number count @xmath6 , with any given source evolution functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a set of functions determining a zero-@xmath0 ltb model can be found to make the ltb observational relations fit the observations .",
    "we demonstrate here , as a first step towards a more general theorem to be applied to qss models without any symmetry , that an axially symmetric zero-@xmath0 szekeres model needs three independent observation sets to be fully reconstructed .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the szekeres models and the particular qss subclass used in this paper .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the derivation of the differential equation giving the redshift - drift . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we display our result for the computation of the drift in bc model 5 and we compare it to that of the @xmath0cdm model and other ltb models studied in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we discuss the issue of closing the reconstruction of our type of model with a sufficient number of data sets , and we propose a solution for axially symmetric qss models . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "the szekeres solutions @xcite are the most general solutions of einstein s equations one can obtain with a dust gravitational source .",
    "they have no symmetry , i.e. , no killing vector , and are therefore well - suited to describe a lumpy universe .",
    "their metric in comoving coordinates and synchronous time gauge is    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions of @xmath12 to be determined by the field equations .",
    "there are two families of szekeres solutions .",
    "the class ii family , where @xmath13 ( here the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath14 ) , is a simultaneous generalization of the friedmann and kantowski - sachs models .",
    "its spherically symmetric limit is the datt - ruban solution whose physical interpretation is not clear @xcite . the class i family of solutions is obtained when @xmath15 .",
    "they contain the ltb solution as a spherically symmetric limit .",
    "we choose therefore this class of solutions to study the redshift - drift in szekeres models . after solving the einstein equations , its metric",
    "can be written , after a change of parametrization more convenient for our purpose @xcite ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a function of @xmath19 and @xmath14 , @xmath20 is a function of @xmath14 , and @xmath21 , \\label{edef}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , functions of @xmath14 .      as it appears from ( [ metsz2 ] ) , only @xmath25 allows the solution to have the three friedmann limits ( hyperbolic , flat and spherical ) .",
    "this is induced by the requirement of a lorentzian signature for the metric . since we are interested in the friedmann limit of our model which we expect to become homogeneous at very large scales , i.e. , that of the last - scattering , we focus only on the @xmath25 case .",
    "it is called the quasi - spherical szekeres ( qss ) model .",
    "its metric , obtained with @xmath25 in eq.([metsz2 ] ) , becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27.\\ ] ]    applying the einstein equations to the metric ( [ ds2 ] ) and assuming the energy momentum tensor is that of dust , the einstein equations reduce to the following two :    @xmath28    where the dot denotes derivation with respect to @xmath19 , @xmath0 is the cosmological constant and @xmath29 is an arbitrary function of @xmath14 related to the density @xmath30 via @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",

    ". it can be easily noticed that ( [ vel ] )  ( [ weyl ] ) reduces to the ltb equations once @xmath36 is set to vanish .    since ( [ vel ] )",
    "is the same in this model as in the ltb model , the bang time function , @xmath37 , follows from ( [ vel ] ) in the same manner as @xmath38 .",

    "hence , each szekeres solution is fully determined by only five functions of @xmath14 . in the following ,",
    "we choose @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and we make the coordinate choice : @xmath47 .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] that only axially symmetric qss models possess rlps and are therefore more suited for an easy study of the redshift - drift in swiss - cheese models .",
    "moreover , in these models , the only rlps are axially directed null geodesics . since , in our swiss - cheese models , we use only radially directed light rays , this implies , as shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , that the szekeres model should be axially symmetric and that , accordingly , the rays we consider for the computation of the drift are rlps .",
    "the simplest axially - symmetric szekeres model obeys    @xmath48 in this case the dipole axis is along @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( or in spherical coordinates along the directions @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .    for the axially",

    "as seen above , in the case of axially directed geodesics the equations which describe light propagation and redshift - drift simplify significantly . moreover , density fluctuations ( [ rho ] ) and curvature fluctuations , ( [ 3dr ] ) and ( [ weyl ] ) , are the largest along the axial axis . when a light ray passes through the origin @xmath92 @xcite .",

    "the matching conditions across a comoving spherical surface , @xmath98 constant , are : the mass inside the junction surface in the szekeres patch is equal to the mass that would be inside that surface in the homogeneous background ( this mass is defined as the mass energy density @xmath30 integrated over the spatial volume inside the junction surface at a fixed time coordinate t ) ; the spatial curvature at the junction surface is the same in both the szekeres and friedmann regions , which implies @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; the bang time and @xmath0 must be continuous across the junction .",

    "given the rather high amplitude of the drift in our model , some cosmologists might be tempted to use it carelessly as an actual discriminator between qss swiss - cheeses and other models .",
    "it was indeed studied in @xcite how the drift could be measured in the future by the proposed e - elt instrument codex or in @xcite by the vlt instrument espresso .",
    "these were claimed in @xcite to be able to discriminate between @xmath0cdm and different ltb models in the course of an observation decade .",

    "decigo / bbo was put forward in @xcite where the experiment duration was estimated to be around 5 - 10 years .",
    "now , we want to stress that the swiss - cheese model we studied here is a mere toy model , not designed to be actually put to the test .",
    "we are not claiming that our universe is constructed with axially symmetric patches , nor that we might be located at the origin of one of such patches or that the light emitted by distant sources should come to us following axially directed geodesics .",

    "inhomogeneous cosmology is still younger and it needs to progress step by step .",
    "this is the reason why , even if after ltb models , szekeres ones are now coming slowly into play , their tricky properties lead us to begin with the study of the simpler qss models , hence axial symmetry and its mathematical simplifications .",
    "we are confident that the rather simple algorithm we display here to completely determine an axially symmetric qss model from background observations will be generalized in the future to the most general qss model , allowing therefore to obtain a very interesting representation of our universe from cosmological data .",
