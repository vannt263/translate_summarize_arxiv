    "fast magnetic monopoles with dirac charge @xmath0 are attractive objects to search for with deep underwater neutrino telescopes .",
    "the intensity of monopole cherenkov radiation is @xmath1 8300 times higher than that of muons .",
    "an optical module ( om ) of the baikal experiment could detect such an object from a distance up to hundred meters . propagating through the universe",
    ", a monopole could be accelerated by magnetic fields up to energies @xmath2 ev @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hence , monopoles with mass below @xmath3 gev are expected to be relativistic .",
    "the monopole energy loss is about 10 @xmath4 for a lorentz factor @xmath5 , but rises significantly with energy ( by a factor 1000 for @xmath6 ) .",
    "monopoles with such energy losses could not cross the earth .",
    "still , for a wide mass range of @xmath7 gev one may search for relativistic monopoles from the lower hemisphere , with significant suppression of the background caused by very energetic atmospheric muons .",
    "the monopole flux is limited by the chudakov - parker bound @xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10s@xmath11sr@xmath11 which results from the requirement that galactic magnetic fields must be conserved .",
    "the strongest experimental bounds on relativistic monopoles ( @xmath12 ) have been obtained by large cherenkov detectors : baikal @xcite and amanda @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the result of a search for relativistic monopoles with the baikal neutrino telescope nt200 , based on data taken in the years 1998 - 2003 ( 994 days ) .",
    "the present stage of the telescope nt200 @xcite takes data since april , 1998 and consists of 192 optical modules ( oms ) at 8 strings .",
    "the oms are grouped in pairs and each pair defines a channel .",
    "a trigger is formed by the requirement of @xmath13 fired channels within 500 ns . for such events amplitude and time of all fired channels within time window 2000 ns are digitized and sent to shore .",
    "the space - time pattern of light recorded from a monopole depends on the water optical characteristics .",
    "the absorption length of baikal deep water is @xmath14(480 nm ) @xmath15 m and slightly varies during years .",
    "scattering in baikal water is characterized by a strongly anisotropic function @xmath16 with a mean cosine of the scattering angle @xmath17 and a scattering length @xmath18 m. the om response to a fast monopole was calculated for a scattering length 30 m. oms facing the monopole path record about one photoelectron at 85 m distance , om turned away still see one photoelectron at 50 m. the uncertainty of the scattering length which varies between 15 m and 30 m leads to an uncertainty of nearly 20@xmath19 for the effective area for fast monopole registration .",
    "the processing chain for fast monopole starts with the selection of events with a high multiplicity of hit channels . in order to reduce the background from downward atmospheric muons we restrict ourself to monopoles coming from the lower hemisphere .",
    "for an upward going particle the times of hit channels increase with rising z - coordinates from bottom to top of the detector . to suppress downward moving particles , a cut on the value of the z ",
    "time correlation has been applied : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are time and z - coordinate of a fired channel , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are mean values for times and z - coordinates of the event , @xmath25 and @xmath26 the root mean square errors for time and z - coordinates .",
    "the requiments @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( cut 0 ) define the first selection stage and leave 0.015% of events that satisfy trigger @xmath29 on @xmath30 strings .",
    "this cut reduces the effective area for monopoles with @xmath31 by almost two times .",
    "the main background for monopole signatures are muon bundles and single high energy muons .",
    "the simulation chain of such muons starts with cosmic ray air showers generated with corsika @xcite .",
    "we use the qgsjet model @xcite and a primary composition according to @xcite . the mum program @xcite is used for muon propagation through water . in fig.1",
    "we compare experimenal data ( solid curve ) and simulated atmospheric muon events ( dashed curve ) with respect to all parameters which have been used for background rejection .",
    "one sees that the simulation describes experimental data quite well , even on the level of those rare events .    within 994 days",
    "live time , about @xmath32 events with @xmath33 have been recorded , with 20943 of them satisfying cut 0 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "all events have been reconstructed according to the standard algorithm @xcite .",
    "for further background supression we use additional cuts , which essentially reject muon events and at the same time only slightly reduce the area for registration of relativistic monopoles .",
    "1 .   @xmath34 and @xmath35 2 .",
    "the @xmath36 determined from reconstruction has to be smaller than 3 ( @xmath37 ) 3 .",
    "reconstructed zenith angle @xmath38 4 .",
    "reconstructed track distance from the center of nt200 @xmath39 m.    nt200 took data in various configurations , due to the different numbers of temporarily operating channels . the different cuts on @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "correspond to different configurations of nt200 . in table 1",
    "the rejection coefficient , i.e. the ratio of events passing cuts 1 - 4 to those passing cut 0 , is presented ( for a subset of configurations representing 50% of full statistics ) . also shown",
