    "nir surveys , such as 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",

    "2mass is currently completing a whole - sky survey to snr = 10 limits of j = 15.8 , h = 15.1 , and k@xmath22 = 14.3 ; at these magnitudes , it is capable of detecting objects like gl 229b out to distances of 12 , 8.3 , and 5.8 pc , respectively , although fainter sources are certainly attainable .",

    "figure 2 shows nir spectral data for a sample of 2mass t dwarfs , obtained at the keck 10 m using the near - infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) , along with data for gl 229b ( oppenheimer et al .",
    "1998 ) . molecular absorption bands of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath13o are clearly evident , while suppression of flux at k - band is also due to h@xmath13 cia .",
    "the slight bend in the j - band peak at 1.25 @xmath0 is due to an unresolved k i doublet , which is clearly evident in higher resolution data ( strauss et al .",
    "one striking feature of these spectra is that they are _ not _ identical .",
    "the prominent 1.6 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 band shows a gradual deepening from 2mass 0559 - 14 to gl 570d , as do combined ch@xmath1 and h@xmath13o absorption bands at 1.15 and 1.4 @xmath0 . at the same time , the 1.25 @xmath0 k i feature disappears , while the k - band peak changes from a sharp bandhead at 2.2 @xmath0 to a more gradual drop - off longward of 2.1 @xmath0 .",
    "we believe these spectral morphology changes are primarily due to temperature differences between the objects .",
    "deeper molecular bands initially result from increasing ch@xmath1 and h@xmath13o number densities in the photosphere via the reaction co + 3h@xmath13 @xmath28 ch@xmath1 + h@xmath13o . at lower temperatures ,",

    "gl 570d is the coolest brown dwarf so far detected ; but , because the gl 570 system is rather old ( @xmath36 @xmath4 2 - 10 gyr ) , it may actually be more massive than gl 229b .",
    "companion brown dwarfs such as these , including recent l dwarf companion discoveries ( kirkpatrick et al .  2000b ; wilson et al .",

    "2mass 1237 + 65 ( burgasser et al .  1999 ) is a faint ( j = 16.03 @xmath33 0.09 ) t dwarf undetected at k@xmath22-band by 2mass .",

    "the broad absorption responsible for the rapid ramp - up from 8000 to 10000  is likely due to the pressure - broadened k i doublet at 7665 and 7699  ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ; liebert et al .",
    "2000 ) .    also indicated in figure 3 is h@xmath12 emission at 6563  , clearly seen in 2mass 1237 + 65 .",
    "this emission line was observed to persist over three days , and subsequent observations have confirmed its presence over timescales exceeding 6 months . while h@xmath12 emission is prevalent in late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs , kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and gizis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that the incidence and strength of emission drops off precipitously beyond spectral type m7v , with no objects later then l5v showing h@xmath12 in emission .",
    "observations of other t dwarfs ( burgasser 2001a ) show a similar lack of activity as measured by the h@xmath12 line . by estimating the bolometric flux of 2mass 1237 + 65",
    ", we measure log(@xmath37 ) = log(@xmath38 ) = @xmath394.2 , consistent with the activity level of late dme field stars ( hawley et al .  1996 ) . given these clues",
    ", 2mass 1237 + 65 must have a unique activity mechanism in order to sustain its relatively high level of emission .",
    "we have proposed that 2mass 1237 + 65 may be a close , interacting binary , in which a lower mass secondary ( and thereby _ larger _ brown dwarf , as @xmath40 = -1/3 for degenerate dwarfs ) is losing mass to the primary via roche lobe overflow , causing shock heating in the latter s atmosphere . in order to sustain mass - loss ,",
    "the physical separation of the primary and secondary must be on the order of 10 jupiter radii ; thus , photometric monitoring will likely provide the best test for this scenario .",
    "regardless , the activity in 2mass 1237 + 65 remains an intriguing puzzle .",
    "the majority of t dwarfs identified by 2mass and sdss have j - band magnitudes between 15 and 16 , placing them between 6 pc ( for the coolest objects such as gl 570d ) and @xmath4 15 pc , depending on temperature and duplicity .",
    "nevertheless , we have identified one object , 2mass 0559 - 14 ( burgasser et al .",
    "2000c ) , which is significantly brighter , with j = 13.83 @xmath33 0.03 .",
    "this is over one magnitude brighter than any other 2mass t dwarf so far discovered , and nearly 0.4 mag brighter than gl 229b at j - band . in addition , 2mass 0559 - 14 is the reddest t dwarf identified in the june 1999 sample , with j - k@xmath22 = 0.22 @xmath33 0.06 .",
    "a rough estimate based on the absolute j - band magnitudes of the l8v gl 584c ( 15.0 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2000a ) and gl 229b ( 15.5 ; leggett et al .",
    "1999 ) , places 2mass 0559 - 14 at about 5 pc ( if it is single ) monotonically decreases from l8v through type t. this relation may not hold if ch@xmath1 and h@xmath13o bands strengthen significantly over a small t@xmath2 range , possibly redistributing flux into the j - band window . ] .",
    "nir spectral data for 2mass 0559 - 14 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the most striking feature about this object is its significant deviation in spectral morphology from the other t dwarfs shown . while cool brown dwarfs such as gl 229b and gl 570d show deep h@xmath13o and ch@xmath1 absorption bands at 1.15 , 1.4 , 1.62.0 , and 2.2 @xmath0 , 2mass 0559 - 14 has significantly shallower absorption troughs , most notably at the 1.6 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 band .",
    "we argue that these features , along with detectable 0.9896 @xmath0 feh ( which weakens toward the late l dwarfs ) and strong 1.2 @xmath0 k i , suggest that 2mass 0559 - 14 is significantly warmer than other 2mass discoveries .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently identified three sdss t dwarfs which have even shallower ch@xmath1 absorption at h- and k - bands , as well as a residual co bandhead at 2.3 @xmath0 .",
    "these objects are probably warmer still , right at the transition between the latest l dwarfs and the onset of ch@xmath1 absorption in the nir fundamental band of ch@xmath1 in objects as early as l5v , indicating that some conversion of co to ch@xmath1 may occur prior to the formation of the 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath0 overtone bands . ] .",
    "in just over one year , an entire population of cool t dwarfs has been discovered .",
    "a great deal remains to be learned about these objects , including absolute magnitudes , space motion , duplicity , variability , activity , space density , and ultimately their contribution to the stellar / substellar mass function and the mass budget of the galaxy .",
    "while over a dozen t dwarfs have been identified in 2mass data , more than one - half of the sky and a great deal of color space remains to be investigated .",
    "in addition , as sdss begins routine survey operations , the opportunity to cross - correlate 2mass and sdss data will allow more sophisticated and hence more complete searches for brown dwarfs in the field .",
    "given the estimates shown in table 1 , it is likely that we will find anywhere from 2 to 20 t dwarfs within 5 pc of the sun , significantly influencing the nearby star sample . finally , it is now possible to develop a new classification for t dwarfs , in analogy to the l dwarf spectral class derived by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "ironically , the future looks quite bright for brown dwarf research .",
