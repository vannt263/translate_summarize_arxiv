    "this turbulent interaction arises when two counterpropagating alfvn waves interact nonlinearly in the plasma medium .",
    "this nonlinear interaction , often referred to as a wave - wave collision , is the central component of astrophysical turbulence and is responsible for the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales.@xcite in order to gain insight into this fundamental building block of astrophysical turbulence , experimental or observational measurements of the nonlinear interaction between two colliding alfvn waves are essential .",
    "turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind @xcite and the interstellar medium @xcite have been measured for several decades . however",
    ", these measurements are mostly used to study the effect of turbulence on the plasma environment .",
    "although characterization of the effects of turbulence on these environments is important , they do little to explain the physical mechanisms comprising the turbulence . more importantly ,",
    "most of this data is limited by the fact that these are single - point measurements and , therefore , do not provide enough information about the 3-d structure of the turbulent fluctuations that leads to energy cascades from large to small scales .",
    "in contrast to observations by spacecraft missions and telescopes , the controlled nature of laboratory experiments allows for more detailed measurements of the small - scale nonlinear interactions between alfvn waves . in this paper , we provide detailed information about the experimental setup , experimental procedure , and data analysis of the first successful effort to confirm this nonlinear interaction , as outlined in @xcite in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the underlying theory",
    ". a more detailed theory can be found in the three companion papers by @xcite , hereafter paper i , @xcite , hereafter paper ii , and @xcite , hereafter paper iii . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the experimental approach , with an emphasis on the two antennas used to produce the two counterpropagating alfvn waves . in sec .",
    "iv , we present an analysis of the experimental results , directly comparing the measured nonlinear signal to the predicted results from the theory .",
    "as shown in paper i , the equations of incompressible mhd can be written in a symmetrized elssser form,@xcite @xmath0    @xmath1    where the magnetic field is decomposed into equilibrium and fluctuating parts @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the alfvn velocity due to the equilibrium field @xmath4 , @xmath5 is total pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) , @xmath6 is mass density , and @xmath7 are the elssser fields given by the sum and difference of the velocity fluctuation @xmath8 , and the magnetic field fluctuation @xmath9 expressed in velocity units .",
    "this symmetrized elssser form of the incompressible mhd equations lends itself to a particularly simple physical interpretation .",
    "an alfvn wave traveling down ( up ) the equilibrium magnetic field is represented by the elssser field @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the second term on the left - hand side of eq . ( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) is the _ linear term _ representing the propagation of the elssser fields along the mean magnetic field at the alfvn speed , the first term on the right - hand side is the _ nonlinear term _ representing the interaction between counterpropagating waves , and the second term on the right - hand side is a nonlinear term that ensures incompressibility.@xcite    as emphasized in paper iii , the mathematical properties of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) and ( [ eq : div0 ] ) dictate that the fundamental building block of turbulence in an incompressible mhd plasma is the nonlinear interaction between perpendicularly polarized , counterpropagating alfvn waves .",
    "additionally , the strength of the nonlinear distortion of an alfvn wave @xmath10 traveling down the equilibrium magnetic field is controlled by the amplitude of the counterpropagating alfvn wave @xmath11 traveling up the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , to measure the nonlinear energy transfer in an alfvn wave collision , one need only launch a single alfvn wave of large amplitude and then observe its effect on a counterpropagating alfvn wave of smaller amplitude .",
    "instrumental limitations on the amplitude of alfvn waves launched in the experiment lead to a situation in which the nonlinear terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) are small compared to the linear term on the left - hand side .",
    "therefore , the experimental dynamics falls into the weakly nonlinear limit , and we can exploit the developments in the theory of _ _ weak mhd turbulence__@xcite to optimize the experimental design , as discussed in detail in paper iii and briefly outlined in the remainder of this section .    consider the case of the nonlinear interaction between two counterpropagating plane alfvn waves with wavevectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 and amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we want to design an experiment that will lead to a measurable nonlinear energy transfer to a third _ daughter _ alfvn wave with wavevector @xmath16 .",
    "as shown in paper i , the application of perturbation theory to obtain an asymptotic solution for the nonlinearly generated daughter alfvn wave demonstrates that resonant three - wave interactions generate a daughter mode with an amplitude proportional to @xmath17 , whereas resonant four - wave interactions nonlinearly generate modes with amplitudes proportional to @xmath18 or @xmath19 . since instrumental limitations",
    "lead to alfvn wave amplitudes that are always small compared to the equilibrium magnetic field , @xmath20 , it is desirable to design an experiment that will create a resonant three - wave interaction between the primary alfvn waves .",
    "the theory of weak mhd turbulence demonstrates that , when averaged over an integral number of wave periods , resonant three - wave interactions must satisfy the resonance conditions@xcite @xmath21 given the linear dispersion relation for alfvn waves , @xmath22 , the only nontrivial solution to both constraints in eq .",

    "this alfvn wave nonlinearly distorts a higher frequency , smaller amplitude alfvn wave @xmath10 that is launched by an arbitrary spatial waveform ( asw ) antenna and travels opposite the direction of the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "the design of the experiment achieves a significant @xmath25 component to the large - amplitude alfvn wave @xmath11 by driving it with a sufficiently low frequency such that its parallel wavelength @xmath27 is longer than twice the physical distance @xmath28 over which the two counterpropagating alfvn waves interact , @xmath29 . in this case , the length of the loop antenna alfvn wavepacket with which the asw wave interacts contains a significant @xmath25 component , leading to a nonzero resonant three - wave interaction that transfers energy from the asw alfvn wave to a daughter alfvn wave with the same parallel wavenumber ( and , thus , the same frequency ) but with higher perpendicular wavenumber . in paper iii , this concept is demonstrated quantitatively , and the properties of the nonlinearly generated daughter alfvn wave are enumerated .    in this paper , we present a detailed analysis of the experimental measurements to identify unequivocally the nonlinear daughter alfvn wave through the verification of the following predicted properties :    1 .",

    "the nonlinear interaction is equivalent to the distortion of the asw alfvn wave as it propagates along this sheared magnetic field .",
    "the distorted asw alfvn wave is simply a linear combination of the initial asw alfvn wave and a nonlinearly generated daughter alfvn wave .",
    "it is the primary goal of this experiment to measure and identify definitively this daughter alfvn wave .",

    "the time in which the two counterpropagating alfvn waves may interact nonlinearly is @xmath88s , less than @xmath89 the loop antenna wave period , @xmath90s . over the time of the nonlinear interaction , the asw alfvn wave interacts with only a fraction of the wavelength of the loop alfvn wave .",
    "the resulting counterpropagating alfvn wave signal experienced by the asw alfvn wave therefore has an effective @xmath91 component as shown in fig . 3 of paper iii .",
    "the nonlinear daughter wave generated by the @xmath91 component of the loop alfvn wave and the asw alfvn wave is predicted theoretically to have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the spatial location of the nonlinear daughter wave should correspond to the position that can be predicted by the nonlinear term in els@xmath73sser form of the incompressible mhd equations .",

    "we predict that the daughter wave will have the same frequency as the alfvn wave produced by the asw antenna , @xmath97 khz .",
    "since the asw antenna produces a wave almost exclusively in the @xmath54 direction and @xmath98 falls between the third and fourth harmonic of the loop antenna signal , the only signal measured on @xmath95 component at @xmath98 should be the daughter wave signal .",

    "( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) . in this case , the maximum for the nonlinear signal will appear at the location where both the magnitude of the loop antenna and the gradient of the asw antenna are largest .",
    "this was clearly evident in the comparison of the measured spatial plot of the daughter wave , fig .",
    "[ fig : bx_diff_plot ] , and the colormap of the predicted location , fig .",
    "[ fig : dot_product_plot ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : halved_amplitude_plot ] , we saw that the daughter wave has a peak at the expected frequency of 270 khz , which corresponds to the frequency of the asw antenna wave signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kx_ky_plots ] , we observed that the perpendicular structure of the daughter wave is dominated by four wavevectors corresponding to @xmath94 .",
    "since the measured daughter wave signal satisfies the theoretical predictions , we conclude that we have measured the nonlinear interaction between two counterpropagating alfvn waves .",
    "this evidence supports the use of such idealized models , as discussed in paper i,@xcite for weakly collisional plasmas which are relevant to various space and astrophysical plasma environments .",
    "it is important to note that this procedure , of subtracting the parent wave signals and bandpass filtering the data , is not required to see the nonlinear daughter wave signal since the three waves are in different locations in the @xmath152-plane and vector orientation of @xmath153 in the plane is different .",
    "although the parent alfvn wave signals are much greater in magnitude then the daughter wave signals , the contributions of the parent waves to the daughter signal at the particular @xmath152-plane location , vector orientation , and frequency is very modest and well resolved given the rms noise level of @xmath154 mg .",
