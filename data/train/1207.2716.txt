    "in recent years there has been an intense study of several properties of classical wave chaotic systems , such as microwave cavities  @xcite and graphs  @xcite , elastic , acoustic , and optical resonators  @xcite .",
    "these systems inevitably exhibit energy dissipation ( absorption ) and many experimental and theoretical investigations have focused on the effect of this absorption on the scattering properties ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to losses of energy the scattering properties are also affected by the imperfect coupling of the antennas to the system , that gives rise to a prompt response due to direct reflections  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for chaotic systems the distribution of the _ sub - unitary _ scattering matrix , @xmath1 , is modulated by a generalization of the poisson kernel , poisson s kernel squared , in a single port , or one channel , configuration  @xcite .",
    "for an arbitrary number of channels , it was found that the poisson kernel squared is the jacobian of the transformation between a non - unitary scattering matrix with direct processes and a non - unitary one without such processes  @xcite .",
    "the poisson kernel was developed first for _ unitary _ scattering matrices . in the one channel ( one - dimensional ) case",
    ", it is obtained from the analytical structure of the scattering matrix @xmath2 and can be interpreted as the probability to find @xmath2 in a certain region of its space  @xcite . for an arbitrary number of channels",
    "the poisson kernel is the probability density of @xmath2 with maximum information entropy , where the only physically relevant parameter is the energy average @xmath3 , known as the _ optical @xmath2 matrix_. in the optical model  @xcite @xmath3 quantifies the direct processes  @xcite ; in the absence of such processes , @xmath4 and the probability density of @xmath2 is a constant .    in a stationary random processes the analyticity - ergodicity conditions yield the poisson kernel as the probability distribution of an ensemble of @xmath2 matrices determined by the ensemble average @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this ensemble represents an ensemble of macroscopically identical systems that describes the statistical fluctuations of scattering properties in chaotic cavities with direct processes  @xcite . when @xmath6 , @xmath2 is uniformly distributed .",
    "also , the poisson kernel appears as the jacobian of a transformation between scattering matrices , with and without direct processes  @xcite .",
    "a physical realization of that transformation was given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this realization was helpful to demonstrate the equivalence , in certain limit , between the imaginary potential model and the voltage probe model , both used to implement dephasing or absorption in ballistic chaotic cavities  @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to deep in the understanding of the poisson kernel .",
    "we study the non - unitary scattering matrix , @xmath1 , in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) problem with spatially localized losses or gains , in the presence of promt responses .",
    "we analyze the analytical structure of @xmath1 to find its probability of stay in a certain region of its space .",
    "it is worth mentioning that local losses or gains have been of theoretical and experimental interest in chaotic systems . in this way ,",
    "local losses have been used to model surface absorption in chaotic cavities  @xcite ; quasimodes in elastic cavities were measured when the absorption increase in a progresive way  @xcite .",
    "also , local gains were used to select scar modes in multimode cavities  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a waveguide terminated by a perfect absorber , was used to study fidelity in chaotic microwave cavities  @xcite . by the other hand",
    ", the nearest level spacing statistics were investigated in open chaotic systems , as a function of the coupling to the environment  @xcite .",
    "however , we recall that in the present work we leave chaos behind and we concentrate in the local character of the absorption or amplification .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in the next section we use the analytical structure in the unitary case to get the analyticity condition for non - unitary scattering matrices , in the one channel situation .",
    "this is done by adding an imaginary part to the energy .",
    "also , we apply that analyticity condition to non - unitary scattering matrices with constant modulus to obtain the poisson kernel . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] we consider a 1d problem with local absorption or amplification and find the probability of stay of the scattering matrix @xmath1 that describes it .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath7 of systems where the flux is conserved is a unitary one that depends on the energy @xmath8 . in the one channel case",
    "it is a @xmath9 matrix that moves on the unit circle as @xmath8 is varied , but it does not visit all points with the same frequency when the energy average @xmath10 of @xmath7 , does not vanish . using the fact that @xmath7 is an analytic function in the upper half of the complex-@xmath8 plane , it is shown that the energy average of the @xmath11-th power of @xmath7 coincides with the @xmath11-th power of @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath12 this result is known as analyticity condition .",
    "dissipation or amplification can be modeled by adding an imaginary part to the energy  @xcite , in which case the scattering matrix , denoted by @xmath13 , is no longer unitary , it is sub - unitary or over - unitary , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath13 can be obtained from an unitary @xmath7 by extending the energy to the complex plane , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and the plus ( minus ) sign holds for absorption ( amplification ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : condition1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : analyticity1 ] ) it is easy to prove that @xmath16 this means that , in the non - unitary case , the scattering matrix satisfies the same analyticity condition as in the unitary one .",

    "@xcite , we assume the existence of the measure @xmath22 which is the probability to find @xmath18 between @xmath18 and @xmath23 and @xmath21 between @xmath21 and @xmath24 .    a very particular situation is the one in which the non - unitary scattering matrix moves along the circle with constant radius , as a function of @xmath8 ; we denote this @xmath9 matrix by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 takes the fixed value @xmath27 . assuming that the energy average of @xmath28 is not null , we want to determine the probability to find @xmath29 in the interval between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this case , @xmath31 with @xmath32 this can be used to evaluate the average of the @xmath11th power of @xmath28 as follows , @xmath33 since @xmath34 is a periodic function of @xmath29 it can be expanded in a fourier series , @xmath35 where the @xmath36 s are constants that satisfy @xmath37 to ensure @xmath34 to be real . using the analyticity condition  ( [ eq : analyticity2 ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath38 with these coefficients the sum in eq .",

    "( [ eq : poisson - rq ] ) reduces to the poisson s kernel of ref  @xcite in the unitary case when we integrate it over the variable @xmath18 for @xmath41 .",
    "a simple model of a cavity with absorption or amplification and direct reflection consists of a dirac delta potential with complex intensity , located at a distance @xmath42 in front of an impenetrable barrier .",
    "the potential is @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are positive constants ; the minus ( plus ) sign corresponds to absorption ( amplification ) .",
    "notice the local character of the absorption or amplification .",
    "the incident waves to the potential suffer multiple scattering before they leave the cavity formed between the infinite barrier and the delta potential . the outgoing plane wave amplitude is related to the incoming one by the @xmath9 scattering matrix given by @xmath46 +   i(k/\\tilde{\\alpha})\\sin ka } { [ \\sin ka + ( k/\\tilde{\\alpha})\\cos ka ] - i ( k/\\tilde{\\alpha})\\sin ka } , \\label{eq : sub - unitario}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath18 is not fixed but it is distributed in a certain interval .",
    "this circle touch the unitary one in the point @xmath53 and @xmath57 where the delta potential is totally transparent because the wave function has a node just in the position of the delta potential .",
    "the real part of the potential affects only the distribution of the phase @xmath21 along the circle . to illustrate this , we present in fig .  [",
