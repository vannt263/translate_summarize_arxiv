    "a new process which is in mcfm version 5.8 is the production of a higgs boson in association with two jets .",

    "the calculations underlying our implementation are performed at nlo using an effective lagrangian to express the coupling of gluons to the higgs field  @xcite , @xmath31 where the trace is over the color degrees of freedom . at nlo",

    "we shall present new phenomenological results for the higgs + 2 jet process , based on analytic calculations of the one - loop higgs + 4 parton amplitudes which have recently been completed .",
    "the use of analytic results leads to a considerable improvement in the speed of the code .",
    "the effective lagrangian used in the calculation of the higgs + 4 parton amplitudes was simplified by introducing a complex scalar field  @xcite , @xmath37 so that the effective lagrangian , eq .",

    "the full higgs boson amplitude is written as a combination of @xmath40 and @xmath41 components : @xmath42    a nice summary of all the one - loop results for the higgs + 4 gluon amplitudes is given in ref .",
    "full references for the analytic calculations of the @xmath43 amplitudes can be found in ref .",

    "in addition to its importance at the lhc , the higgs + 2 jet cross section is also important at the tevatron .",
    "the experiments  @xcite analyze the events with different numbers of jets separately to make maximal use of the different kinematic structure . in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can refine the estimate of the theoretical uncertainty on the number of higgs signal events originating from qcd parton fusion processes    .comparison of calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the corresponding determination using the uncertainty derived from the lo result for the higgs  @xmath45 jet bin is @xmath46  @xcite , so the result in eq .",
    "( [ uncertain ] ) represents a modest improvement in the overall theoretical error , but one which will have implications for the higgs search at the tevatron .",
    "another new process which is included at nlo is the production of pairs of top quarks including the decay .",
    "the top quarks are kept strictly on their mass shell , so the processes of production and decay are separately gauge invariant , but full spin correlations are kept .",
    "although this is not a new result  @xcite , it is importantant to include it in the mcfm package because top pair production is such an important background for many processes at hadron colliders .",
    "we can assess the importance of including these spin correlations by looking at the angular separation of the two charged leptons coming from top decay .",
    "the expected data sample of top quark pairs at @xmath2  tev will be too small to observe these correlations , but they should be observable at @xmath47  tev .",
    "[ topphi ] shows the azimuthal angle @xmath40 in the transverse plane between the two charged leptons in top pair production events .",
    "in addition to standard lepton and jet cuts , @xmath48  gev , @xmath49  gev , @xmath50  gev , @xmath51 we apply the cut @xmath52  gev to constrain the top quarks to be produced close to threshold  @xcite .",
    "these specific cuts have been suggested by schulze  @xcite .",
    "the basic ratios of cross sections are governed by the parton luminosities .",
    "[ ratcomp ] shows the ratios of parton luminosities in @xmath53 collisions at @xmath54 and @xmath55  tev compared to the luminosity in @xmath56 collisions at @xmath1  tev .",
    "considering in detail the case of @xmath55 tev , in the range @xmath57  gev the @xmath58 luminosity goes up by a factor of @xmath59 whereas the @xmath60 luminosity grows by at least a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "this means that for @xmath62 induced processes the tevatron has a competitive advantage .",
    "that is , in a scenario where the tevatron has an accumulated luminosity of @xmath63  fb@xmath3 and the lhc has an accumulated luminosity of @xmath64  fb@xmath3 at @xmath2  tev , the tevatron still has a competitive advantage for @xmath65 induced processes .",
    "we now further discuss the situation if the tevatron were to run for three further years after 2011 ; after this period the experiments would have accumulated 16  fb@xmath3 per experiment of analyzeable luminosity .",
    "fig .  [ rate ] shows the number of events produced for various standard model processes , assuming 16  fb@xmath3 of accumulated luminosity for the tevatron and 1  fb@xmath3 of accumlated luminosity for the lhc .",
    "in this situation the tevatron would have a clear advantage for @xmath62 initiated processes .        the situation with regard to the standard model higgs boson is interesting , since at the tevatron the low mass higgs boson is sought in association with a vector boson @xmath66 in the @xmath67-initiated mode @xmath68 . if we take the precision standard model fits @xcite seriously , the standard model 2@xmath69-allowed region for the higgs boson mass is @xmath70   gev . in this region",
    "the primary decay of the higgs boson is into @xmath71 , a channel which is not expected to be observable at the lhc until @xmath72  fb@xmath3 have been accumulated at @xmath73  tev  @xcite .    if the tevatron were to accumulate 16  fb@xmath3 of analyzeable luminosity , per experiment it could provide @xmath74 evidence for the standard model higgs boson in the range @xmath75  gev  @xcite .",
    "this is an important goal , which would provide complementary information to the information on the decay @xmath76 which will be available from @xmath77  tev running at the lhc .",
    "this year has been mainly a consolidation period for mcfm , but with the introduction of two new processes at nlo , top pair production with decay and the higgs boson + 2 jet production at the lhc .",
    "using mcfm it has been shown that the tevatron can provide important information on @xmath62 initiated processes , and that for these processes it will be superior to the lhc until considerable data has been accumulated at @xmath73  tev .",
    "an important example is the higgs boson where the @xmath78 decay of the low mass higgs can be looked for .",
    "information in this channel is complementary to the information from the lhc and probably unique until at least 2015 .",
