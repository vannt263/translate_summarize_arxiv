    "we describe a search for a massive color - octet vector particle @xmath5 , which we call generically a `` massive gluon '' .",

    "we consider only the possibility of novel strong - sector production ; we assume that the weak decay of the top quark follows the sm .",
    "since the color and the current structures of @xmath5 and sm gluon ( @xmath13 ) are identical , interference between processes through massive gluon and massless gluon will produce a @xmath1 invariant mass distribution with an enhanced signal that has a characteristic form @xcite as shown later in fig .",

    "the cdf ii detector is a general purpose detector which is azimuthally and forward - backward symmetric .",
    "the detector consists of a charged particle tracking system composed of silicon microstrip detectors and a gas drift chamber inside a 1.4 t magnetic field , surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and enclosed by muon detectors .",
