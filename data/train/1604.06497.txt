    "these observations have renewed interest in cylindrical accretion geometries @xcite , `` sausage '' instabilities that form clusters with regular spacings along filaments @xcite , and hybrid scenarios involving accretion via cylindrical filaments onto dense , spherical molecular cloud cores , often observed at the nodal points where filaments intersect @xcite .",
    "one of the most visually striking irdc complexes in the galaxy is the m17 southwest extension , or m17 swex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pw10 ) .",
    "the morphology of m17 swex resembles a dark , flying dragon ( figure  [ fig : ised ] ) , extending 1@xmath5  ( 35 pc at @xmath6  kpc ) to the southwest from the bright m17 region , to which it is connected by a bridge of molecular gas @xcite .",

    "recent vlbi maser parallax measurements have both clarified and complicated the three - dimensional picture of the m17 complex @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a distance of @xmath11  kpc from parallax measurements to the water maser associated with the dense molecular core and ultracompact ( uc ) region g014.3300.64 , located in the midst of the m17 swex irdc lanes .",
    "this is highly discrepant with the kinematic distance .",
    "the m17 region itself has an associated methanol maser with a parallax distance of @xmath12  kpc @xcite .",
    "this parallax distance does not strongly depart from the kinematic distance and has become the generally accepted distance to the region and m17 sw .",
    "@xcite report a parallax distance of @xmath13  kpc to a water maser associated with g014.6300.57 , located at the end of m17 swex closest to the m17 region . as @xcite note ,",
    "the parallax distances to g014.6300.57 and m17 are in agreement , while the significantly nearer distance to g014.3300.64 indicates that this maser belongs to a foreground cloud .",
    "all three masers have similar @xmath14 and are assigned to the sagittarius - carina spiral arm by @xcite and @xcite , with m17 and g014.6300.57 on the far side and g014.3300.64 on the near side of the arm .",
    "this raises the possibility that the m17 complex consists of several overlapping clouds along the line of sight . for the g014.22500.506 irdc , the focus of this work , no maser parallaxes are yet available , so we assume @xmath6  kpc , the same distance as the m17 region .",
    "this choice is motivated by the observation that both the irdc and the m17 gmc are centered at the same @xmath15  km  s@xmath2  ( @xcite ; b13 ) , while the g014.3300.64 maser has multiple velocity components at 19 , 22 , and 26  km  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the components at @xmath16  km  s@xmath2  are by far the strongest emitters , and this is also the velocity peak of the surrounding , lower - density molecular cloud traced by co ( @xmath17 ) emission observed using the james clerk maxwell telescope , part of the highest - resolution co map obtained to date for the entire m17 complex ( c. beaumont 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "this supports the historical picture that the bulk of the m17 complex is at a similar distance , with g014.3300.64 belonging to a smaller , foreground cloud with a high peculiar velocity .",
    "we discuss the g014.3300.64 region in more detail in section [ sec : surprising ] .",
    "on 30 and 31 july 2011 , we obtained a 98.79 ks continuous /acis exposure centered at @xmath18 ( j2000 ) using the four detectors of the acis - i array plus the s2 and s3 detectors on the acis - s array (  observation i d 12348 , pi m. s. povich ) .",
    "acis - i has an approximately @xmath19 square field - of - view ( fov ) with 0.492  pixels @xcite .",
    "the point source catalog and analysis presented in this work are restricted to acis - i , because the angular resolution of the  grazing - incidence mirrors is poor at the large off - axis angles ( @xmath20 ) of the acis - s detectors , and the acis - s detectors covered a part of the sky far from the m17 swex irdc filaments .",

    "we use mid - infrared ( mir ) data at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath4 m  from glimpse and at 24  @xmath4 m  from mipsgal , covering the full @xmath21 m17 swex field studied by pw10 ( see figure  [ fig : ised ] ) .",
    "this `` ir wide field '' spans the entire irdc complex , and should not be confused with the much smaller acis fov .",
    "the glimpse data analysis pipeline produces a highly - reliable point source catalog that is a subset of a more - complete point source archive .",

    "our standard strategy ( see pw10 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to use the highly - reliable catalog to identify ir excess sources produced by the dusty , circumstellar disks and infalling envelopes of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and to use the more - complete archive to provide mir counterparts to x - ray sources , some of which will identify ysos that are not present in the more restricted catalog @xcite . our experience shows that using the archive instead of the catalog to search for ir excess sources produces a high false - positive rate , but by using x - ray selection to identify archive sources of interest we are able to retrieve reliable mir photometry for sources that are too faint or crowded to appear in the catalog . following pw10 and @xcite , we perform aperture photometry on the mipsgal 24  @xmath4 m  mosaics _ only _ for ir excess sources identified at shorter wavelengths ( see appendix  [ ire ] ) .",
    "this means we do not identify sources that show excess emission only at 24  @xmath4 m , for example transitional disks , because the high potential for source confusion in the inner galactic plane coupled with the lower , @xmath24 resolution of mips compared to irac and _ 2mass _ , generates significant numbers of false matches between 24  @xmath4 m  sources and field stars @xcite .",
    "the combination of unusually high interstellar reddening from the irdc and circumstellar reddening from protostellar envelopes produces significant differential extinction between nir and mir wavelengths .",
    "the _ 2mass _ photometry , used by pw10 , is therefore not deep enough to detect highly reddened stars or deeply embedded protostars detected by glimpse and mipsgal in irdcs such as m17 swex .",
    "we therefore produce deep , @xmath22 photometry catalogs by applying the optimal photometry method of @xcite to publicly - available ukidss data @xcite covering our full m17 swex field ( figure  [ fig : ised ] ) .",
    "the ukidss images provide sub - arcsec resolution and point - source sensitivity to @xmath25  mag .",

    "spitzer _ and _ chandra _ point sources .",
    "the results of our classifications for the 840 x - ray catalog sources ( described in appendix [ sec : classify ] ) are presented in figure  [ fig : xsed ] .",
    "+    the 564 x - ray - detected probable complex members ( pcms ) are generally distributed in a `` v''shaped pattern that follows the two main irdc lanes .",
    "the 72 foreground stars are more widely distributed across the field , but concentrated more toward the center where the x - ray point - source sensitivity is greater . the spatial distribution of the 203 remaining unclassified sources reflects the strong imprint of the varying x - ray point - source sensitivity , with @xmath26 of unclassified sources having @xmath27 , compared to @xmath28 of pcm and @xmath29 of foreground stars .",
    "k  s tests reveal that the foreground , pcm , and unclassified categories all have significantly different distributions with respect to @xmath30 , which supports the conclusion that our classification procedure has identified distinct populations of sources with different spatial distributions , correcting for the spatial variations in the x - ray point source sensitivity .",
    "spatial distributions that show clustering of sources within obscured star - forming complexes are one of the most powerful lines of evidence that x - ray sources and ysos trace young stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and `` nearest - neighbor analysis , '' a category that includes some types of point - source surface density measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we have used gaussian kernel surface density estimation to identify pcms detected as ysos with ir excess emission ( appendix [ ire ] , step 7 and table  [ tab : ised ] , columns 12 and 13 ) and nearest - neighbor distances to identify pcms detected only in x - rays by their proximity to other pcms ( appendix [ sec : pcmprox ] ) .",
    "we can use the spatial distribution of point sources with respect to the observed irdc filaments to evaluate the results of our x - ray and yso pcm classifications . if pcms are preferentially located near the irdc filaments , this is strong evidence for membership , whereas if they are preferentially located far from the irdc filaments , or in a distribution that appears uniform ( no evident relationship with the filaments ) , then this calls their membership into question .",
    "the fact that we have already used spatial clustering information in our pcm classifications might seem to bias the results from the start , however the observation that some pcms cluster near _ each other _ does not presuppose that these groupings should be projected on or near the irdc . furthermore , @xmath31 of the final x - ray pcm sample was identified using spatial clustering ( appendix  [ sec : pcmprox ] ) , and an insignificant fraction of ysos in the acis fov was _ not _ flagged as pcms on the basis of overdensity ( figure  [ fig : ised ] ) .",
    "we need not worry that our spatial analysis will have been biased by the sample selection .    measuring the distance of point sources from a set of predetermined ,",
    "linear extended features is a different problem from identifying clusters of point sources or compact extended sources with respect to each other , hence the standard approaches of minimal spanning trees or nearest - neighbor analysis are inappropriate .",
    "we have developed a `` filament  imprint '' analysis ( fia ) technique that parameterizes the degree to which the spatial distribution of a given source population bears the imprint of the various linear irdc filaments in the field .",
    "we represent the locations of the 8 dense filaments identified by b13 as 8 line segments ( figure  [ fig : xsed ] ) , each defined by its endpoints in galactic coordinates . for the various source samples of interest , we compute the set @xmath32 of _ minimum _ angular separations between each source and the _ nearest _ `` filament '' line segment ( using the idl routine pnt_line ) .",
    "we then define @xmath33 as the _ median _ value of @xmath32 , hence parameterizing the typical separation between that particular source sample and the filaments .",
    "to simulate a control sample that is not influenced by the presence of the filaments , we run a simple monte carlo experiment to generate @xmath34 uniform samples of coordinates , each with the same _ average _ surface density as the sources in @xmath32",
    ". then we compute @xmath35 , the analog of @xmath32 for _ each _ of the @xmath34 uniform samples .",
    "finally we define a dimensionless , `` filament imprint parameter , '' as @xmath36 hence @xmath37 is the _",
    "mean _ value of the _ median _ separation @xmath38 measured across the @xmath34 uniform samples .",
    "we have set @xmath39 for our simulations .",
    "the logic behind our definition of @xmath40 is made clearer by considering the astrophysical implications of the limiting cases .",
    "@xmath41 for @xmath42 , in which case the majority of sources lie on or near a linear filament , compared to a random distribution .",
    "astrophysically , this configuration would be approached if the irdc contained _ only _ ysos embedded in the centers of the filaments . in general",
    "@xmath43 indicates positive correlation between pcms and filaments .",
    "@xmath44 for @xmath45 , consistent with a random source distribution that bears no imprint of the filaments .",
    "only a foreground population , unaffected by absorption from the irdc , would be expected to be uncorrelated with the filaments .",
    "@xmath46 is possible for @xmath47 , in which case the target source distribution preferentially _ avoids _ the filaments ( negative correlation ) .",
    "thus , astrophysically , negative @xmath40 values would indicate a background source population strongly absorbed by the irdc ( a sample dominated by agn , for example ) .",
    "for the fia to provide evidence that a given sample of real sources `` knows about '' the irdc , we must determine whether its measured @xmath40 departs significantly from our null hypothesis of a uniform configuration .",
    "we do this by computing @xmath48 , the ( two - tailed ) statistical @xmath49-value of our measured @xmath40 with respect to the simulated distribution produced by replacing @xmath33 with @xmath38 in equation 1 .",
    "we consider source samples with @xmath50 to depart significantly from the null hypothesis , providing convincing evidence that the sources bear the imprint of the irdc filaments ( table  [ tab : fia ] ) .    for x - ray sources",
    ", the fia is complicated by the variation of point - source sensitivity with off - axis angle @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore follow the advice of @xcite and restrict our spatial distribution analysis to the subset of bright x - ray sources that would be detected over the full range of @xmath30 used in the fia .",
    "we find that we must use @xmath51 , encompassing nearly the entire acis fov ( figure  [ fig : xsed ] ) , because for the fia to work properly we must sample a relatively large area _",

    "the sample size in the second column reflects the number of sources within @xmath62 , and for samples of x - ray selected sources this number is further reduced by our @xmath52 cut to remove faint sources .",
    "because of these differing selection criteria , fia would not produce meaningful results for the combined pcm sample of x - ray and ir excess - selected sources .",

    "that we can estimate @xmath40 for such small numbers of sources , we find _ negative _ @xmath40 values , suggesting an tendency to avoid the irdc filaments , but the @xmath48-values are consistent with the null hypothesis of a uniform source density .",
    "we assume implicitly that the bright x - ray sources used for fia are representative of the spatial distribution of the full population .",
    "this assumption may not be valid , but we are comfortable making it because the fainter sources include many pcms that are highly - obscured by dust in the irdc lanes .",
    "hence we expect a bias toward _ higher _ filamentary clustering of fainter pcms , which would suggest that our @xmath40 values obtained for the brighter sources _ underestimate _ the true degree of clustering among the pcms .",
    "we see precisely this effect when applying fia to the ysos stratified by @xmath68 ; while both samples are significantly clustered , ysos with @xmath60  mag are _ more _ clustered , and at a higher significance level , compared to the less - obscured ysos ( table  [ tab : fia ] , and we further discuss this effect in section  [ sec : spatial ] below ) .",
    "we conclude that our combined ir - excess and x - ray source classification methodology , presented in appendix  [ append : pcms ] , works well to identify young stellar populations provided ( 1 ) there is sufficient foreground extinction toward pcms ( @xmath69  mag ) to allow separation of foreground stars from pcms , and ( 2 ) high background absorption screens out the majority of background stars and agn .",
    "any galactic irdc should fit these conditions , and our fia results show that they hold for m17 swex .",
    "the spatial distribution of less - obscured foreground sources does not bear an imprint of the irdc . a significant fraction of mis - classified background sources among the x - ray pcms would dilute or erase the observed clustering along the filaments .",

    "while the addition of diskless sources partially compensates for the steep ymf slope and brings the combined pcm mass function closer to the expected salpeter - kroupa slope , we do not expect completeness because our sample is biased against x - ray quiet , late b stars that lack ir excess and have neither detectable intrinsic x - ray emission nor x - ray bright companions . as previously noted by pw10 , the lack of massive , o - type stars is real , not a selection effect , and we will discuss its implications in section  [ sec : massive ] .",
    "we follow our standard procedure for measuring the number of stars ( above the hydrogen - burning limit at @xmath108  @xmath0 ) in a model stellar population @xmath109 and their total mass @xmath110 ( @xcite ; pw10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assume the actual mass function follows the salpeter - kroupa imf scaled to match the peak of the observed mass function ( figure  [ fig : ymfs ] ) .",

    "hierarchical filament collapse . _",
    "the less - massive halo population formed primarily from lower - mass clumps in the irdc filaments and perhaps also in lower - density `` streamers '' in the halo gas flowing onto the irdc filaments .",
    "the hierarchical collapse models of @xcite predict numerous , shallow gravitational potential wells surrounding a smaller number of deep potential wells .",
    "the shallower wells form lower - mass clusters early in the simulation , which subsequently can fall into the deep potential wells , increasing the gas mass collecting there and ultimately forming massive clusters . as @xcite point out",
    ", hierarchical collapse could explain observations that massive stars are among the last to form ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as they are born exclusively in the densest molecular cores .",
    "simulations of star formation generally predict dynamical relaxation and evaporation caused by dynamical encounters between stars and expulsion of gas by protostellar jets , stellar winds , and expanding  regions .",
    "@xcite further predicted that dynamical interactions could truncate circumstellar disks and limit the mass of stars ejected from clouds by removing them from their supplies of accreting gas .",
    "such a process could perhaps explain the filament - halo mass segregation observed in m17 swex .",
    "the cloud simulated by @xcite was 23 orders of magnitude less massive than m17 swex , and the ejected low - mass stars and brown dwarfs would be far below the detection limits of our observations , so it is not clear that their predictions of mass segregation can be extrapolated to the intermediate - mass stars in our pcm halo population .",
    "we note that `` diskless '' in our nomenclature refers to the lack of a mir excess from an _ inner _ dust disk .",
    "it is possible ( even likely ) that our `` diskless '' stars still possess debris disks with large inner holes and excess emission at ir wavelengths longer than 24  @xmath4 m . our mir data do not allow us to identify debris disks or to reliably constrain the outer radii of yso disks , so we can not make any statements about disk truncation . at present , hierarchical filament collapse models @xcite appear to provide a more natural explanation for the observed mass and age segregation in m17 swex .",
    "compared to irdc complexes dominated by a smaller number of long , linear filaments , for example the `` nessie '' nebula @xcite or g034.42 + 00.24 @xcite m17 swex may be a relatively low - density gmc .",
    "m17 swex may be similar to l1641 , the southern region of the orion a gmc , which is a very active star - forming region that has not produced massive stars @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite predict an imf weighted toward intermediate masses in lower - density clouds , in which case our low - mass imf extrapolations using a standard salpeter - kroupa model would overestimate the true stellar mass and hence sfr in m17 swex .",
    "such a model is more likely to apply to the less - obscured population in the lower - density halo than to the high - density irdc filaments themselves , suggesting that the extrapolated halo population could be overestimated .",
    "our extrapolations predict that the ( likely incomplete ) younger , clustered population represents @xmath142 of the _ total _ stellar population , hence we do not expect that our reported global sfr is significantly overestimated due to our assumption of a standard imf",
    ".      as pw10 pointed out , m17 swex seems poised to produce a large stellar association with a significant deficit of massive stars .",
    "the sfr measured within the acis fov is @xmath143  @xmath0  yr@xmath2 , _ at least _ four times the sfr of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , and the extrapolated sfr for the entire m17 swex complex ( recalling that only half of the ysos in m17 swex are concentrated in our acis fov ) rivals or exceed the @xmath144  @xmath0  yr@xmath2  sfr in ngc 6618 , the cluster ionizing the bright m17  region itself @xcite .",
    "this is not an artifact of time - averaging , since the durations of star formation in m17 swex , ngc 6618 , and the onc are approximately the same ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of o - type stars with @xmath145  @xmath0  anywhere in m17 swex hence remains difficult to explain in the context of a standard imf ( figure  [ fig : ymfs]b ) .",
    "as pw10 noted , o stars inevitably heat the surrounding gas and dust , producing regions that can not be missed in mir images , but we have either directly detected or included the equivalent masses of the ionizing stars responsible for all of the bright mir nebulae within the acis fov ( see figures  [ fig : xcat ] and [ fig : members ] ) , none of which is more luminous than an early b star .    the dearth of ob stars could be a statistical fluctuation , as the sfr of m17 swex falls within the range where we might not expect complete sampling of the upper imf @xcite . but based upon our modeling of the pcm population mass function ( figure  [ fig : ymfs]b ) the ob deficit appears to be statistically significant .",
    "using the lower - bound @xmath146 derived from the mass function , a salpeter - kroupa imf predicts between 11 and 50 ob stars with @xmath147  @xmath0  ( the range is due to the reported uncertainty on @xmath148 ; @xcite ) for the acis fov alone , and extrapolating to all of m17 swex predicts twice as many ob stars .",
    "the o - star deficit in m17 swex seems extreme when compared to the local volume of the galaxy within 500 pc of the sun .",
    "the orion molecular cloud , dominated by the onc , contributes more than half of the sfr in the local volume and contains multiple o stars @xcite .",
    "the sfr in m17 swex is at least four times the sfr in the local volume , yet has not produced any o stars .    because m17 swex contains active sites of massive star formation , we should not discount the possibility that its massive cores may yet form o stars .",
    "none of the cores in m17 swex appears completely quiescent ( even the least active core , g014.07700.558 , harbors at least one highly - embedded protostar , visible in the mipsgal 24  @xmath4 m  image , that is not detected at shorter wavelengths , and a dense grouping of three ysos and one x - ray source is found on its eastern edge ; figure  [ fig : members ] ) .",
    "the embedded star clusters ionizing compact regions ( ir - n , ir - s , and ir - se ) and malt90 molecular cores containing ysos and protostars seen only at 24  @xmath4 m  ( see table  [ tab : malt90 ] and figure  [ fig : members ] ) represent possible sites for massive cluster formation at a range of evolutionary development .",
    "@xcite resolve hub - n and hub - s into 26 fragmentary 1.3 mm continuum sources , ranging in mass from @xmath149  @xmath0  to 20  @xmath0 .",
    "none of these fragmentary sources _",
    "currently _ is massive enough to form an o - type star .",
    "however , the total mass @xmath150 of each hub is of the same order as very massive cores observed in other irdcs many of which harbor protoclusters with luminosities exceeding any of the protoclusters in m17 swex @xcite .",
    "the lower - density halo surrounding the irdcs represents an enormous mass reservoir containing the bulk of the @xmath151  @xmath0  measured by co observations of m17 swex @xcite . in other irdcs , there is mounting evidence that lower - density halo gas continually falls inward onto irdc filaments , flowing along the filaments and accreting onto the massive cores located at the filament nodes @xcite .",
    "b13 note that hub - n and hub - s are locations where gas at different velocities converges .",
    "if such a process is underway in m17 swex , the cores could rapidly gain mass , perhaps sufficient mass ultimately to form o stars in the protoclusters we already observe .",
    "the hierarchical collapse models of @xcite lend theoretical support to the idea that massive complexes form their most massive stars relatively late in their star - forming history . as smaller clusters and cores fall into the larger cores",
    ", the most massive ( proto)clusters can continue to grow , leading to an sfr that increases with time @xcite .",

    "ir counterparts to x - ray sources with photometry in a combination of @xmath206 bands _ other _ than @xmath22 have no sed fitting results available and can not be plotted on the color - color and color magnitude diagrams of figure  [ fig : jhk ] . for such sources we can not reliably distinguish between red colors caused by interstellar versus circumstellar reddening , but above a certain color threshold the distinction does not matter , as very red colors are evidence for pcm .",
    "we identified these thresholds by comparing the distributions of @xmath207 and @xmath208 colors for the remaining unclassified sources to those of sources previously classified as foreground versus pcm .",
    "we classified 23 new pcms with @xmath209  mag ( without @xmath83 detections ; not counting one pcms previously classified by x - ray variability ) and 7 new pcms classified with @xmath210  mag ( without @xmath179 detections ) .",

    "we also identified 16 previously unclassified pcms with mir counterparts but no nir counterparts ( excluding one previously classified by x - ray variability ) .",
    "these sources were classified as pcm because a detection in the glimpse archive but not in the deep ukidss observations implies a highly - embedded x - ray source .",
    "after all of the other classification steps were performed , we visually identified a number of unclassified x - ray sources located in several tight clusters that contained significant numbers of pcms , coinciding with several compact mir nebulae in m17 swex ( see figure  [ fig : xcat ] ) .",
    "two of these clusters are associated with `` hub - n '' and `` hub - s , '' dense nodes where multiple filaments intersect identified by b13 .",
    "the clusters are too dense or mir - bright to have point sources resolved by irac and too dense or embedded for all of the x - ray sources to have counterparts detected by ukidss .",
    "to identify x - ray mcpms within these small clusters or otherwise in close proximity to other pcms , we computed the mean separation @xmath211 of each remaining unclassified source to its four nearest pcm neighbors .",
    "we found that the distribution of @xmath211 among the 241 remaining unclassified sources was highly skewed toward larger values of @xmath211 .",
    "we thus rejected all @xmath211 values that were @xmath212-sigma outliers above the mean , and recomputed the mean and variance ( @xmath213 and @xmath214 ) from this sigma - clipped distribution .",

    "we set a somewhat arbitrary threshold of @xmath215 to assign the most highly - clustered unclassified sources to the pcm class ; this criterion identified 41 new pcm , or 17% of the remaining unclassified sources , in the closest proximity to pcms classified using other criteria .",

    "ideally , one would obtain spectra of the stellar populations to derive @xmath229 independently , and then sed fitting would provide strong constraints on extinction and luminosity , however at present it is prohibitively expensive to perform nir spectrocopy on hundreds of obhjects in distant , heavily - obscured regions such as m17 swex .",
    "we therefore leverage two pieces of _ external _ knowledge , namely the range of evolutionary ages consistent with a source being both _ diskless _ and _ detectible in x - rays _ to weight the probability distributions according to the @xmath221 model parameter .",

    "we use disk lifetimes to constrain ages of diskless pms stars to the extent that we assume inner disks that would produce detectible mir excess emission become disfavored for @xmath251 , where the disk lifetime is defined using the pw10 power - law parameterization as @xmath252 ( see section  [ sec : disks ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath253  @xmath0  with @xmath254  myr , the `` canonical '' disk lifetime for low - mass ysos @xcite and @xmath255  @xmath0  with @xmath256  myr for massive ysos @xcite .",
    "these constraints together yield the power - law index @xmath257 for the mass - dependent disk lifetime .",
    "we also adopt an uncertainty on @xmath117 of @xmath258 on the disk lifetimes , based on the allowable variation in @xmath259 that would still be consistent with our observed values of @xmath104 ( see figure  [ fig : ymfs ] and section  [ sec : disks ] ) .",
    "we assume that the actual lifetimes among real ysos are normally distributed relative to the mass - dependent average disk lifetime @xmath117 .",

    "@xmath0 ) we set @xmath269 ( no weighting ) regardless of @xmath260 , but in practice this step proved unnecessary , because effectively zero model fits to luminous , non - mires seds returned sufficiently young ages ( @xmath270  myr ) to produce @xmath271 according to equation  [ eq : diskweight ] .",
    "once a star arrives on the zams , it is impossible to place a useful upper bound on its age using broadband photometry alone . for all but the most massive stars , the main - sequence turnoff age ( the maximum @xmath221 allowed by our models )",
    "is many orders of magnitude older than the stellar population in a star - forming region such as m17 swex .",
    "this presents a problem , because if _ any _ main - sequence model provides an acceptable fit to a given source sed , then _ all _ main - sequence models at that mass will provide acceptable fits , biasing the distribution of @xmath260 toward unrealistically old ages .",
    "the fact that our sources have x - ray detections mitigates this sed model bias .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray luminosity of pre - ms stars in the mass range 0.5  @xmath0@xmath272  @xmath0  decays rapidly with age , as @xmath273 .",
    "this explains empirically why x - ray observations are so effective at detecting young stellar populations against overwhelming contamination from older field stars in ir images and also provides a useful , quantitative weighting constraint for interpreting our sed model fits .",
    "as with most relations between x - ray luminosity and other stellar properties , there is a very large scatter about the trend , of roughly an order of magnitude in @xmath274 .",
    "the relative probability , as a function of @xmath221 , that we can detect in x - rays a star of a particular mass at a given evolutionary age can hence be approximated as the _ fraction _ of stars with mass @xmath224 and age @xmath221 that happen to have @xmath274 above the sensitivity limit of the x - ray observation .",
    "this fraction decreases approximately as @xmath274 , and we hence model the time - decay in probability of an x - ray detection as @xmath275 where the constant @xmath276  myr is the evolutionary age beyond which the steep decay in luminosity reported by @xcite becomes clearly observable ( their fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is strictly appropriate to apply @xmath248 only for t tauri stars in the mass range 0.5  @xmath0@xmath272  @xmath0 .",
    "our ir observations are insufficiently deep to detect most such low - mass stars in m17 swex , as evidenced by figure [ fig : ymfs ] . but",
    "the intermediate - mass , a- and b - type zams stars in our sample are expected to be x - ray quiet , so we may assume that unresolved , t tauri binary companions to the ir - detected primary are responsible for the detected x - ray source @xcite .",
    "in such cases , @xmath248 is appropriate for modeling intermediate - mass stars , since young , secondary companions detected in x - rays provide age constraints on their coeval , intermediate - mass primaries .    because the x - ray emission processes for massive , ob stars are fundamentally different from low - mass , pre - ms stars , we set @xmath277 ( no weighting ) for all models with @xmath268  @xmath0 .",

    "<S> we present a catalog of 840 x - ray sources and first results from a 100 ks _ chandra x - ray observatory _ imaging study of the filamentary infrared dark cloud g014.22500.506 , which forms the central regions of a larger cloud complex known as the m17 southwest extension ( m17 swex ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the rich population of protostars and young stellar objects with dusty circumstellar disks revealed by _ spitzer space telescope _ archival data , we discover a population of x - ray - emitting , intermediate - mass pre  main - sequence stars ( imps ) that lack infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> we model the infrared spectral energy distributions of this source population to measure its mass function and place new constraints on the inner dust disk destruction timescales for 28  @xmath0  stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also place a lower limit on the star formation rate ( sfr ) and find that it is quite high ( @xmath1  @xmath0  yr@xmath2 ) , equivalent to several orion nebula clusters in g14.2250.506 alone , and likely accelerating . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud complex has not produced a population of massive , o - type stars commensurate with its sfr . </S>",
    "<S> this absence of very massive ( @xmath3  @xmath0 ) stars suggests that either ( 1 ) m17 swex is an example of a distributed mode of star formation that will produce a large ob association dominated by intermediate - mass stars but relatively few massive clusters , or ( 2 ) the massive cores are still in the process of accreting sufficient mass to form massive clusters hosting o stars . </S>"
