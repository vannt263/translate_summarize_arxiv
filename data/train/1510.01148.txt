    "[ sec : intro ]    visual tracking is an indispensable part of computer vision with wide ranging applications , such as video surveillance , vehicle navigation and medical imaging @xcite .",
    "while much effort @xcite has been made on object tracking in the last few years , it seems difficult to find lasting solutions to enduring problems due to intrinsic factors ( e.g. shape deformation and pose variation ) and extrinsic factors ( e.g. occlusions and varying illumination ) .",
    "recently , sparse representation @xcite has been successfully applied in visual tracking , early stemming from the @xmath1 tracker proposed by mei @xmath2 @xcite and their improved version @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 method represents a target by a sparse linear combination of the target templates and trivial templates , and then solves it using a @xmath1-regularized least squares method .",
    "the accelerated proximal gradient approach @xcite is used to solve @xmath1 norm minimization efficiently . however , because of adopting the global sparse appearance model , these methods are less effective in handling heavy occlusions . different from them , a local sparse appearance model @xcite is introduced to enhance target representation and tracking robustness .",
    "local patches inside a possible target candidate are sparsely represented with local patches in the dictionary templates .",
    "joint sparse appearance model @xcite exploits the intrinsic relationship among particles to represent the target jointly .",
    "locality - constrained linear coding ( llc ) @xcite is proposed to represent local appearance in tracking framework @xcite because of its excellent performance ( eg .",
    "similarity in feature space and close - form solution ) .",
    "it utilizes the sparse histograms of sparse coefficients and local optimal search scheme for object tracking .",
    "however , this method just uses a static local dictionary and does not provide additional constraint on encoding coefficients , leading to tracking drift easily .",
    "the spatial layout information is embedded in coding stage on appearance model @xcite .",
    "motivated by the previous work , we aim to develop a more robust approximated llc tracker , especially when the non - negativity constraint on encoding coefficients is taken into consideration .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) a @xmath0 norm regularization term is introduced into approximated llc , instead of the non - negativity constraint , to guarantee encoding coefficients nonnegative by choosing a regularization parameter .",
    "( 2 ) rather than using a static local sparse dictionary , a series of local dictionaries with pre - defined different numbers of nearest neighbors are provided .",
    "weights of a linear combination of these dictionaries are learned from approximated llc , and that is similar with solving encoding coefficients in the same framework .",
    "( 3 ) to mitigate drifting problem , the occlusion detection criterion depends on whether negative templates are used to represent the target .",
    "once negative templates are selected to reconstruct the target , we conclude that the target suffers from severe occlusion .",
    "experiments on some public sequences compared with several prevalent tracking methods show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracking algorithm .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : related ] gives the relevant related work of the proposed method .",
    "section [ sec : proposed ] gives the details of the proposed method .",
    "section [ sec : experiment ] shows the experimental results from the proposed method , with comparisons to eight existing state - of - the - art methods .",
    "finally , conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the implicit rationale behind particle filter @xcite is to estimate the posterior distribution @xmath3 approximately by a finite set of random sampling particles . given some observed image patches at @xmath4-th frame @xmath5 , the state of the target @xmath6 can be estimated recursively .",

    "@xmath12 , referred to as the motion model , denotes state transition between two consecutive frames .",
    "the observation model @xmath13 reflects the similarity between a target candidate and the target templates .",
    "thus , the optimal state at @xmath4-th frame is obtained by maximizing the observation model : @xmath14 in our method , the observation model is formulated from the reconstruction error by the multiple local dictionaries using approximated llc .",
    "llc applies locality constraint to select similar basis of local image descriptors from a codebook , and learns a linear combination weight of these basis @xmath15 to reconstruct each descriptor @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath21 is a scale factor parameter that controls the weight decay speed .",

    ", we can simply select @xmath22 nearest neighbors of @xmath16 as the local dictionary @xmath23 . in visual tracking process @xcite ,",
    "the candidate @xmath24 is represented by the linear combination of several local basis vectors as the dictionary @xmath23 with encoding coefficients @xmath25 sparsely .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a vector with all ones and the constraint @xmath28 ensures shift - invariant .",
    "the closed - form solution of ( [ allc ] ) is @xmath29^{-1}\\textbf{1}$ ] .",
    "some observed vectorization image patches(@xmath30 ) at @xmath4-th frame @xmath31 are sampled based on particle filter framework . in order to better capitalize on the distinction between the foreground and the background to locate the target , plenty of negative templates",
    "are collected .",
    "the positive and negative template sets are defined as @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the number of positive and negative template sets respectively .",
    "generally , the tracking result in the first frame is manually chosen as a rectangle box .",
    "define that @xmath36 is the center of the rectangle box , and the initial positive templates are sampled from an inner circular area that satisfies @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the center of the @xmath39-th sampled patch .",

    ".        it might be tempting to agree that approximated llc guarantees local sparsity and good reconstruction in visual tracking algorithm .",
    "however , ( [ allc ] ) overlooks some potential information on coefficients .",
    "norm regularization term leads to the good result ( in red ) by eight templates ( # 53 , # 54 , # 55 , # 56 , # 57 , # 58 , # 59 and # 60 ) in the right - hand .",

    "it is represented by by a linear combination of eight templates ( # 6 , # 7 , # 23 , # 32 , # 45 , # 47 , # 52 and # 53 ) with their corresponding coefficient vectors in green curves .",
    "the red one , as a good tracking result , is indicated by eight positive templates from # 53 to # 60 in red .",
    "although the good or bad tracking results are both dictated by the positive template set , the bad result suffers severe drifts and contains much background information . in this case",
    ", the only difference between these two tracking results is that some selected positive templates ( # 6 , # 32 and # 47 ) are with negative coefficients . in other words , positive templates with negative coefficients",
    "lead to an unreliable tracking result .",
    "it seems to be a little specious and negative coefficients lose the significance of data representation on the target .    just as the nonnegative matrix factorization(nmf )",
    "@xcite , the target appearance is modeled as nonnegative linear combinations of a set of nonnegative bases that implicitly captures structure information of the target . thus , for every candidate @xmath24 , its @xmath22 nearest neighbors from the template set @xmath47 $ ] is obtained to construct the local dictionary @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding encoding vector is obtained by : @xmath48      in most case , the number of nearest neighbors @xmath22 is specified manually with a fixed value . as such , this parameter is not automatically adjusted and only one local dictionary @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath24",

    "@xmath50 , how to combine these @xmath50 to the final encoding vector @xmath25 is an overriding concern in our tracking framework .",
    "let @xmath56^t$ ] be a weight vector , it implies @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the weight vector @xmath59 is obtained by the following objective function : @xmath60 let @xmath61 $ ] , ( [ multi ] ) is transformed into : @xmath62 this objective function is also an approximate llc problem with non - negativity constraint , similar to ( [ allcn ] ) and ( [ knn ] ) .        in the above analysis , @xmath25 and @xmath59",
    "are both obtained by solving the approximated llc problem with non - negativity constraint .",
    "there are many optimal iteration methods for the constraint linear quadratic programming problem , such as interior point method , the accelerated proximal gradient method ( apg ) @xcite , admm @xcite .",
    "however , the non - negativity constraint destroys the structure of analytic solution in approximated llc due to its non - differentiable character .    to tackle this problem",
    ", we introduce a @xmath0 norm regularization term to replace the non - negativity constraint .",
    "therefore , ( [ allcn ] ) and ( [ multillc ] ) are rewritten as : @xmath63 @xmath64 the solution of the objective function in ( [ allcr ] ) is @xmath65^{-1}\\textbf{1}$ ] .",
    "and the solution of @xmath59 is in the similar fashion . in this case , the structure of closed - form in coefficient vector @xmath25 and weight vector @xmath59 is preserved .",
    "we will illustrate these elements in @xmath25 and @xmath59 still remain nonnegative in the following sections .",
    "the rationale for this replacement is described in more details .      for the sake of mathematical convenience and",
    "easy to use in the subsequent description , we construct a local dictionary @xmath23 selected from @xmath24 s @xmath22 nearest neighbors ( temporary not consider multiple dictionaries @xmath66 with different nearest neighbors ) .    define @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the solution of ( [ allcr ] ) is rewritten as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 ( and @xmath71 ) is a positive definite matrix .",

    "is converted to how to guarantee @xmath71 as a strictly diagonally dominant matrix . _",
    "an intuitive idea is to make @xmath79 a strictly diagonally dominant matrix by choosing @xmath80 value ( @xmath81 ) . and then seek for the relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath71 in terms of strictly diagonally dominant character .",
    "it is easy to choose @xmath80 , and the lower bound of @xmath80 is given :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is an arbitrarily small positive constant . because @xmath84 is a positive semi - definite matrix , then @xmath85 is not only a positive definite matrix but also strictly diagonally dominant matrix by choosing @xmath80 to satisfy ( [ lambda ] ) .    in this condition ,",
    "_ the proposition that @xmath25 is nonnegative is transferred to prove a conclusion that @xmath71 is a strictly diagonally dominant matrix if and only if @xmath79 is a strictly diagonally dominant matrix . _    however , @xmath72 and its strictly diagonally dominant property can not guarantee @xmath71 is a diagonally dominant matrix in theory .",
    "this proposition is tenable only when @xmath86 , and a counterexample ( @xmath87 means the dimension of @xmath79 is @xmath88 ) is constructed as shown in below :",
    "@xmath89    in the above example , it is clear that @xmath71 is not a strictly diagonally dominant matrix despite that @xmath79 is .      in the above theoretical analysis",
    ", it seems to be unreasonable when the non - negativity constraint is replaced by @xmath0 norm regularization term on @xmath25 .",
    "however , in our practical application , some implicit information in @xmath23 , @xmath90 , and @xmath79 is overlooked .",
    "for example , these elements in these matrices are nonnegative ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 have been normalized , whose values are from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .    first , we need to analyse the property of @xmath79 and @xmath71 with respect to a growth tendency to @xmath80 .",
    "ostroski @xmath2 discusses the upper bound of these elements in a strictly diagonally dominant matrix s inverse matrix @xcite .",
    "let @xmath93_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath94 then elements in the dominant diagonal of @xmath71 satisfies : @xmath95    as with @xmath80 increases , @xmath96 tends to decrease . and",
    "the value range of @xmath97 will reduce .",
    "when @xmath80 tends to a sufficient constant , @xmath98 pales in importance compared with @xmath99 ( means @xmath100 ) .",
    "@xmath97 approximates to @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath71 is a diagonal matrix approximately . in this case , as a diagonal matrix , @xmath71 is definitely a diagonally dominant matrix . in a word , by choosing an appropriate @xmath80 , @xmath71 approximates to a diagonally dominant matrix to ensure @xmath25 nonnegative .",
    "now we should be confronted with how to select the proper @xmath80 . that @xmath80 is selected to a extremely large value ( e.g.,@xmath102 ) would make no sense to our practice application .",
    "the relatively proper @xmath80 is mainly determined by our image data .",
    "considering each column of @xmath23 and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 represents a @xmath105 image patch ) , elements in these matrices are quite small .        empirical statistic experiments in fig.[fig2 ] show that the mean gray value of each positive template is roughly @xmath106 , and those of negative templates seem to be relatively chaotic , from @xmath91 to @xmath107 .",
    "thus the mean gray value of @xmath23 selected from positive templates @xmath108 is approximately equal to @xmath106 . for candidates as shown in the right - hand of fig.[fig2 ] , their values range from @xmath109 to @xmath110 . in this condition , each element @xmath111 in @xmath112 .",
    "the upper bound of each element in @xmath113 is estimated to @xmath114 .",
    "after the upper bound of elements in @xmath113 are obtained , @xmath80 is easily solved .",

    "the lower bound of the proper @xmath116 is in a similar fashion .",
    "specially , with respect to different nearest neighbors @xmath117 in our experiment , @xmath118 is chosen .",
    "this value not only satisfies ( [ est_lambda ] ) but also is much larger than @xmath119 . in this condition",
    ", @xmath79 can be approximated to a diagonal matrix , accordingly , @xmath71 can be regarded as a strictly diagonal dominant matrix . moreover , because the * theorem 1 * is a sufficient and unnecessary condition , relatively smaller @xmath80 could also guarantee these elements in @xmath25 non - negative .",
    "we will analyze the tracking results with different @xmath80 values in section [ sec : conclusion ] .      from the above analysis ,",
    "it is reasonable to substitute the non - negativity constraint to @xmath0 norm regularization term in our image data . therefore @xmath120 is obtained by ( [ allcr ] ) with its corresponding local dictionaries @xmath121 .",
    "noting that the selected templates composed of @xmath66 need to be recorded .",

    "it means that the first adopted template is in the @xmath123-th of the whole templates set , and until the @xmath55 adopted template is in the @xmath124-th of templates set .",
    "subsequently , let @xmath125 be the uniform coefficient vector , whose dimension is equal to the number of templates .",
