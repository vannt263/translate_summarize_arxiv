    "the splashing of liquid drops on a solid surface has long been a subject of both visual appreciation @xcite and quantitative fluid mechanical studies @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have reinvigorated this subject , by showing that removal of the vapor surrounding a drop suppresses splashing , an effect commonly associated with the presence of a lubrication layer of gas beneath an impacting drop , and a number of papers discuss splash modeling taking account of the gas .",
    "recent examples , from which earlier literature may be traced , include @xcite .",
    "detailed flow measurements of splashing laboratory drops are challenging , due to the speed of the process and the small length scales involved , which motivates us to perform molecular dynamics simulations . here , control of the materials and initial conditions is straightforward and configurational information and flow fields at fine spatial and temporal resolution are relatively easy to obtain .",
    "a particular advantage of this method is that the initial presence and distribution of vapor outside the drop may be altered at will .",
    "the price of high resolution and control is that only relatively small systems may be studied in this way , and we have considered drops roughly 12 nm in radius . although many aspects of macroscopic fluid flows have been found to persist down to this scale , differences exist ( see below ) , and we find that nanodrop impacts only partially agree with recent laboratory observations",
    ". in particular , the presence of vapor does not appear to be necessary for nanodrops to splash .",
    "the simulations employ standard classical molecular dynamics techniques @xcite .",
    "the drops are composed of small liquid molecules containing either two or four lennard - jones ( lj ) atoms , bound into flexible linear chains by a fene interaction @xcite . the drops contain 157,126 atoms placed at the center of a box of dimensions @xmath0 and are initially equilibrated while floating freely using a nos - hoover thermostat at temperature t=0.8 @xmath1 .",
    "here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the length and energy parameters in the lj potential , and @xmath4 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the characteristic time unit in the simulations is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the atomic mass .",
    "representative physical values of these parameters are @xmath7 nm and @xmath8 ps . in the simulations ,",
    "newton s equations are integrated using a fifth - order predictor - corrector method with a time step of 0.0005@xmath9 .",

    "the `` edge '' of the drop is actually a sigmoidally - shaped transition region between liquid and vapor with a width of a few @xmath3 , and the ratio of vapor to liquid densities is about a half of that of air to water at room conditions .",
    "the tetramer system forms a similar drop of radius 35.8@xmath3 and density @xmath10=0.86 @xmath11 but in contrast to the dimers has very little vapor under these conditions , less than 1/10 the density of the dimer case .",
    "in addition , we have in some cases also considered two variant systems , one in which a drop of tetramer is surrounded by vapor of the dimer system , as a caricature of water drops in air , and the second a dimer system in which the vapor molecules are removed by hand at the moment when the drop is given its initial downward velocity .",
    "( we do not consider a monatomic liquid because its vapor pressure is so high as to obscure the shape of the interface after impact . )",
    "the simulation box is periodic in the transverse @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions while the bottom of the box has one layer of fcc cells of solid atoms , which are mobile but tethered to the lattice sites by stiff springs .",
    "the fluid atoms have a standard unit - strength lj interaction with each other , while in most cases the interaction between fluid and solid atoms has only a @xmath15 repulsive component , corresponding to a completely non - wetting system .",
    "we occasionally refer to a completely - wetting solid where the liquid - solid interaction has standard strength , but the effects of wettability and patterned surfaces are explored in more detail in subsequent paper .",
    "the combined liquid - vapor - solid system is equilibrated for 100@xmath9 , sufficient for the drop radii and densities to stabilize .",
    "the measurements were repeated for a monomer lennard - jones fluid as well as the tetramer fluid studied in the paper , and the results are summarized in table iii .",
    "the point of the monomer measurement is that this simulated material is a reasonable approximation to liquid argon , whose sound speed has been measured experimentally to be 853 m/s at 44.4mhz and 85k and atmospheric pressure @xcite , close to the simulation result for method i. the fact that the sound speed in dimer liquids is lower than in monomer liquids is consistent in trend with ideal gas theory where @xmath16 : the adiabatic index @xmath17 is lower for dimers than monomers ."

    "<S> equilibrated floating drops consisting of short chains of lennard - jones liquids with adjustable volatility are directed normally onto an atomistic solid surface where they are observed to bounce , stick , splash or disintegrate , depending on the initial velocity and the nature of the materials involved . </S>",

    "<S> the disintegration can be understood as either a loss of coherence of the liquid or as the result of a local temperature exceeding the liquid - vapor coexistence value . </S>",
