    "square - shaped ol can stabilize fundamental solitons and solitary vortices ( solitons with embedded vorticity ) in two dimensions @xcite . as concerns vortex solitons , the lattice breaks the isotropy of the embedding space and the related angular momentum conservation .",
    "nevertheless , the intrinsic topological charge of the vortex can be defined unambiguously as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the circulation of the phase of the respective complex wave function around the vortex pivot .",

    "crater - shaped \" vortices , in the form of a single density peak with an inner hole , trapped , essentially , in a single cell of the square lattice , is unstable @xcite .",
    "stable vortices with charge @xmath9 can be constructed , in the simplest form , as sets of four peaks , with phase shift @xmath10 between adjacent ones .",
    "two stable four - peak vortex structures are possible ,  rhombuses \" ( with a nearly empty cell in the middle ) @xcite and more compact  squares \" @xcite . for @xmath3 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath11 , these patterns are actually quadrupoles .",
    "higher - order stable vortices , up to @xmath12 , were found too , in the form of circular chains of @xmath13 or @xmath14 peaks @xcite . also found were  supervortices \" , built as ring - shaped chains of @xmath14 compact ( crater - shaped ) local vortices with individual vorticity @xmath15 , onto which global vorticity @xmath16 is imprinted @xcite .",
    "the supervortex is stable despite the instability of crater - shaped vortices in isolation .",
    "two - dimensional solitons , as well as vortices and quadrupoles of the rhombic type , can also be stabilized by the quasi-1d ols , i.e. , periodic potentials depending on a single coordinate @xcite .    for repulsive contact interactions , square - shaped ol can support 2d fundamental and vortical gap solitons @xcite .",
    "in addition , axisymmetric radial potentials may stabilize solitons , including vortical ones , in both cases of the attractive and repulsive interactions @xcite .    despite the theoretical progress ,",
    "2d matter - wave solitons have not yet been observed , vortex solitons being a still more challenging subject .",
    "therefore , the search for viable settings allowing the realization of such structures remains highly relevant . in parallel to bec , theoretical and experimental studies of multidimensional spatiotemporal solitons draw great interest in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "new possibilities for producing 2d solitons emerge in dipolar quantum gases , such as becs of magnetically polarized @xmath17cr atoms @xcite , dipolar molecules @xcite , or atoms with electric moments induced by strong electric field @xcite or laser illumination @xcite . of these systems , the gas of chromium atoms is the medium available for current experiments . for axisymmetric geometry , with dipoles polarized perpendicular to the 2d plane , the natural anisotropic dipole - dipole ( dd ) interaction gives rise to in - plane repulsion and axial attraction , which can support vortex lattices @xcite and , in principle , 2d gap solitons ( in the presence of the respective ol ) . on the other hand",

    ", we assume the axisymmetric configuration as in ref .",

    "the solitary vortex is stable , whereas the vortex soliton with @xmath3 splits via a quadrupole instability .",
    "since the only reported experimental demonstration of 2d spatial vortex solitons requires the presence of photonic lattices in photorefractive crystals @xcite , and because no observation of vortex solitons was reported in uniform media , the proposal to create such solitons in dipolar becs is pertinent to the experiment , especially in view of recent advances in tuning out the local nonlinearity via a feshbach resonance ( fr ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i , we apply a variational approximation to predict localized - vortex states yielding a minimum of the dipolar condensate energy . naturally , these states have a chance to represent stable vortex solitons . in section iii ,",
    "results of direct simulations of vortex solitons , performed in the framework of the full 3d  gp  equation , are summarized . for that purpose , we use both numerically exact profiles , which are generated from the variational _ anstze _ by means of the preliminarily simulated propagation in imaginary time , and the _ anstze _ themselves , the corresponding results being quite similar .",
    "the paper is concluded by section iv .",

    "the change of the sign of @xmath59 corresponding to the transition from @xmath50 to @xmath55 is due to the respective change of the relative strength of  side - by - side \" and  head - to - tail \" dd interactions , which dominate the prolate and oblate configurations , respectively .",
    "consequently , for @xmath60 and fixed @xmath61 , the integrated dd energy , @xmath62 , _ decreases _ both for @xmath63 ( since @xmath64 for large @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 ( because @xmath67 in this limit ) , leading to either expansion or collapse along @xmath68 .",
    "inversion of the sign of @xmath69 @xcite , converts the energy maximum at the prolate / oblate transition point , into a minimum .",
    "it is thus required to stabilize 2d isotropic patterns , with the dipolar moments polarized along the cylindrical axis .",
    "this requirement for @xmath69 inversion , in combination with the necessity to reduce the strong contact repulsion using the fr , is an experimental challenge .",
    "the existence of stable _ anisotropic _ fundamental ( non - topological ) solitons , with the dipoles polarized in the @xmath70 plane and the ordinary sign of the dd interaction ( @xmath60 ) @xcite , suggests that anisotropic topological ( vortex - like ) solitons may be found in the same setting .",
    "however , we leave the analysis of such complex patterns to a separate work , aiming here to retain the cylindrical symmetry , adopting the assumption of @xmath71 .    assuming the sign inversion of the dd interaction , the minimum in @xmath62 as a function of @xmath72 at @xmath73 will translate into a minimum of total energy @xmath74 ,",
    "provided that @xmath62 is large enough to offset the contact - interaction and gradient terms , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , both scaling linearly with @xmath72 .",

    "as expected , conditions ( [ ness ] ) can only be satisfied for @xmath71 . the required strength , @xmath84 , increases with @xmath9 due to the growing centrifugal contribution to the kinetic energy , which must be balanced by the attractive part of the dd interaction . in the strong - interaction regime , with @xmath85 , the kinetic term may be neglected , and eq .",
    "( [ ness ] ) simplifies to @xmath86 .",
    "condition ( [ ness ] ) only guarantees a minimum of the gp energy as a function of @xmath72 for fixed @xmath61 , which is not yet sufficient for a true minimum of @xmath87 in the @xmath88 plane .",
    "in particular , fixing @xmath65 and varying @xmath89 , one can see that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , so that kinetic energy @xmath76 can not balance interaction terms @xmath93 for large @xmath61 . since @xmath94 in the large-@xmath65 sector of the @xmath88 plane , this will lead to the 3d collapse , with @xmath95 , _ unless _ the vertical - confinement size @xmath96 is smaller than the effective healing length , determined by the interplay of the kinetic energy with the combined contact and dd interactions .    in fig . 1",

    "this results in a monotonic decrease of the energy as @xmath79 at fixed @xmath61 , causing the radial expansion of the bec . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dd interaction is too strong , the energy decreases monotonically for fixed @xmath65 as @xmath95 , implying the 3d collapse ( figs .",

    "the dd interaction is strong enough to offset the dispersive effect of the contact and kinetic terms , yet is not excessively strong to induce the 3d collapse .",

    "as mentioned above , the contact interaction may be experimentally controlled by means of the fr @xcite , and the dd interaction may be tuned using additional external fields reversal , zoller , or simply turned off by removing the polarizing field , which allows the dipolar order to frustrate . in fig .",

    "preliminary numerical simulations including a quintic loss term of this magnitude indicate that soliton behavior is not considerably affected by these losses . the remaining difficulty ( common with that for fundamental solitons predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the necessity to invert the sign of the dd interaction by means of the rapidly rotating magnetic field @xcite , a technique which still has to be experimentally demonstrated .    in conclusion ,",
    "using the variational analysis and direct simulations of the gp equation in three dimensions , we have predicted the existence of stable quasi-2d vortex solitons with topological charge @xmath2 in the dipolar bec with atomic moments polarized perpendicular to the 2d plane , and the inverted sign of the dipole - dipole interaction . while energy minima exist",
    "also for solitary vortices with @xmath3 , the resulting soliton is unstable and splits into a quadrupole set after the evolution in the course of a few trap periods .",
    "future work will explore the possibility of anisotropic solitary vortices with an in - plane polarization axis and the natural sign of the dd interactions .",
