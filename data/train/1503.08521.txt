    "there is a refinement of linear width known as _ thin position _ , which we discuss when we use it in section [ section : flow ] .      in order to bound morse area in terms of linear width we shall assume the following result announced by pitts and rubinstein @xcite ( see also rubinstein @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite [ conjecture : pr ] let @xmath1 be a riemannian @xmath0-manifold with a strongly irreducible heegaard splitting .",
    "then the heegaard surface is isotopic to a minimal surface , or to the boundary of a regular neighborhood of a non - orientable minimal surface with a small tube attached vertically in the i - bundle structure .",
    "a full proof of this result has not yet appeared in the literature , though recent progress has been made by colding and de lellis @xcite , de lellis and pellandrini @xcite , and ketover @xcite .",
    "we shall show :    [ theorem : morse ] there is a constant @xmath28 , such that for any closed hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold , @xmath29 where the right hand bound holds assuming theorem [ conjecture : pr ] .",
    "our methods are effective , and the constant @xmath30 may be estimated using a bound on the margulis constant for @xmath31 , though we omit the details of this calculation , as our methods seem unlikely to give an optimal constant .      in section [ section : metric bounds topology ] , we show how to bound linear width in terms of morse area .",
    "a bound on the morse area of @xmath1 gives a morse function @xmath7 , with bounded area level sets , but with no _ a priori _ bound on the topological complexity of the level sets .",
    "we use a voronoi decomposition of @xmath1 to give a polyhedral approximation of the morse function , which we now describe in a simple case .",
    "let @xmath32 be a voronoi decomposition of @xmath1 in which every voronoi cell @xmath33 is a topological ball , and has size bounded above and below , i.e. there is an @xmath34 such that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the center of the voronoi cell .",
    "let @xmath37 be the sublevel set of the morse function , i.e. @xmath38)$ ] .",
    "the sublevel sets are a monotonically increasing collection of subsets of @xmath1 , which start off empty , and eventually contain all of @xmath1 , so in particular , for each voronoi cell @xmath33 there is a @xmath39 such that the volume of @xmath40 is exactly half the volume of @xmath41 , and we shall call @xmath39 the _ cell splitter _ for the voronoi cell @xmath33 . furthermore , we may assume that the @xmath39 are distinct for distinct voronoi cells .",
    "this gives a linear order to the voronoi cells , and we wish to show that constructing the manifold by adding the voronoi cells in this order gives a bounded linear width handle decomposition for @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the union of the voronoi cells whose cell splitters @xmath39 are at most @xmath43 .",
    "each voronoi cell is a ball , with a bounded number of faces , so adding a voronoi cell corresponds to adding a bounded number of handles .",
    "it remains to show that the boundary of each @xmath42 has genus bounded in terms of the area of the level set @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath45 be two adjacent voronoi cells , with @xmath33 contained in @xmath42 and @xmath45 outside @xmath42 , so their common face is a subset of @xmath46 . consider the sequence of balls @xmath47 , as @xmath48 runs along the geodesic from @xmath36 to @xmath49 .",
    "at least half the volume of @xmath41 is contained in @xmath37 , and at most half the volume of @xmath50 is contained in @xmath37 , so there is an @xmath48 such that exactly half the volume of @xmath51 is contained in @xmath37 , and so there is a lower bound on the area of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , a bound on the area of @xmath53 gives a bound on the number of faces of @xmath46 . as each face has a bounded number of edges , this gives a bound on the genus of @xmath46 , and hence a bound on the linear width of @xmath1 , though this bound depends on @xmath54 .    in order to produce a bound which works for any compact hyperbolic manifold @xmath1",
    ", we use the margulis lemma and the thick - thin decomposition for hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "there is constant @xmath55 , called a margulis constant , such that any compact hyperbolic manifold may be decomposed into a thick part @xmath56 , where each point has injectivity radius greater than @xmath55 , and a thin part , where each point has injectivity radius at most @xmath55 , and which is a disjoint union of solid tori .",
    "if we choose @xmath54 sufficiently small , then we may choose a voronoi decomposition of the thick part in which each voronoi cell has size bounded above and below , and run the argument in the previous paragraph to control the genus of @xmath46 inside the thick part .",
    "we do not control the complexity of @xmath46 in the thin part , but as each component of the thin part is a solid torus , we may cap off @xmath57 with surfaces parallel to @xmath58 , while still obtaining bounds on the genus . in order to bound the number of handles corresponding to adding a voronoi cell , we use a result of kobayashi and rieck @xcite which gives bounds on the topological complexity of the intersection of a voronoi cell with the thin part .",
    "the key problem for the upper bound is that the techniques of pitts and rubinstein use sweepouts , so although their minimax construction produces a sweepout of bounded area , we do not know how to directly replace a bounded area sweepout with a bounded area foliation .",
    "however , the upper bound is obtained in recent work of colding and gabai @xcite , using work of colding and minicozzi @xcite on the mean curvature flow , and we describe their results in section [ section : flow ] .",

    "in this section we show that we can bound the scharlemann - thompson width of a hyperbolic manifold in terms of its morse area . we will approximate level sets by surfaces which are unions of faces of voronoi cells , and we start by describing the properties of the voronoi decompositions that we will use .",
