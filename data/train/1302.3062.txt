    "transition metal oxides@xcite are of great interest in condensed matter physics because they exhibit a rich variety of exotic phenomena which remain incompletely understood . while `` late '' transition metal oxides ( involving cu or ni ) have been very extensively studied due to their connection to high-@xmath2 superconductivity and mn - based compounds have attracted attention for their colossal magnetoresistance , the `` early '' transition metal oxides such as vanadium oxides have , despite some important studies , @xcite received less attention in recent years . however , following the pioneering work of ohtomo and hwang,@xcite early transition metal oxides are increasingly used as components of atomic - scale oxide - based heterostructures .",
    "@xcite one goal of heterostructure research is to design materials exhibiting phases not observed in bulk.@xcite an essential step towards realizing this goal is obtaining a clear understanding of the relationship between physical structure and observed electronic phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the relationship between lattice structure , correlation strength and electronic properties in the context of ferromagnetism in early transition metal oxides .",
    "ferromagnetism is a correlated electronic property which is both technologically important and ( because only a spin symmetry and not translation or gauge symmetry is broken ) more straightforward from the theoretical and computational points of view than other phases such as antiferromagnetism or superconductivity .",
    "we choose the early transition metal oxides in part because of the intriguing recent report@xcite of ferromagnetism in superlattice systems involving lavo@xmath3 and srvo@xmath3 .",
    "the report is of interest because ferromagnetism is reported for the superlattice even though no ferromagnetism is observed in bulk solid solutions of the form la@xmath4sr@xmath5vo@xmath3 .",
    "one possible explanation is that the superlattice enables a different crystal structure , more favorable to ferromagnetism than that found in the observed bulk structures .",
    "understanding whether this explanation is viable , and more generally being able to design superlattices with desired magnetic properties , requires deeper insight into the conditions    the conditions under which ferromagnetism may occur is a question of long - standing theoretical interest.@xcite the development of dynamical mean field theory @xcite has opened a new avenue of research , but apart from some pioneering investigations of the curie temperatures of fe and ni @xcite the studies have mainly been based on model systems .",
    "vollhardt , ulmke , and collaborators have studied the single - band hubbard model , finding that in this model ferromagnetism occurs at generic carrier concentrations only when there is a large density of states peak at or near the lower band edge.@xcite for a fixed value of the hubbard @xmath6 , the curie temperature @xmath2 was found to depend sensitively on the peak position , becoming unmeasurably small as the density of states peak was moved a small distance away from the lower band edge.@xcite however , many materials of physical and technological interest involve transition metals with partially filled degenerate ( or nearly degenerate ) @xmath7 levels , where the hund s interaction may play an important role . while the importance of the hund s interaction in partially filled @xmath7 levels has been appreciated for decades , the issue has been systematically studied only in the case of the bethe lattice @xcite in which the density of states has a simple semicircular structure .",
    "in this situation large values of the hund s coupling and correlation strength ( the hubbard @xmath6 ) are required for ferromagnetism .",
    "three possible magnetic phase diagrams for bulk solid solution la@xmath4sr@xmath5vo@xmath3 as a function of carrier density ( @xmath8 axis ) and tilt angle ( @xmath9 axis ) .",
    "the phase boundaries are the black curves .",
    "( a ) weak correlations : slater antiferromagnet at @xmath10 .",
    "( b ) intermediate correlations .",
    "( c ) strong correlations : mott insulator at @xmath10 .",
    "the notations are : fm for ferromagnetic , pm for paramagnetic , afm for antiferromagnetic order , and i for insulating state . ]    in this paper , we study the conditions under which ferromagnetism may occur in systems related to la@xmath4sr@xmath5vo@xmath3 ( lsvo ) . in this family of materials the key orbitals are vanadium @xmath7 levels . these are partly filled ( in la@xmath4sr@xmath5vo@xmath3 the mean number of @xmath7 electrons is @xmath11 ) and the electrons are subject to a strong hund s coupling , favoring magnetism .",

    "we treat the many body physics using the single - site dynamical mean field approximation,@xcite which is widely used in real - materials many - body physics calculations@xcite and in particular in studies of ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite    our main result is an understanding of the dependence of ferromagnetism on carrier concentration , octahedral rotation and correlation strength . at non - integer electron concentration",
    "we find that increasing the octahedral rotation amplitude increases the tendency to ferromagnetism .",
    "the physics underlying this result is a density of states effect related to that previously noted in the one - band hubbard model.@xcite we also find that at fixed rotation amplitude the carrier concentration dependence of ferromagnetism depends on the correlation strength . for",
    "weak to moderate correlations ( so that at the carrier concentration @xmath12 corresponding to lavo@xmath3 the paramagnetic phase is metallic in contradiction to experiment @xcite ) decreasing the carrier concentration below @xmath12 weakly decreases the tendency to ferromagnetism . for stronger correlations ( so that at the carrier concentration @xmath12 corresponding to lavo@xmath3 , the insulating phase is a mott insulator ) , doping away from lavo@xmath3 strongly increases the tendency towards ferromagnetism . an intermediate situation may also occur .",

    "[ fig : schematic_pd ] present schematic representations of these three cases .",
    "we remark that in the literature , the many - body physics properties of transition metal oxides have been modeled in two ways .",
    "one , which we refer to as the `` @xmath7 only model , '' treats the frontier orbitals ( in the case of the vanadium - based materials , antibonding bands derived mainly from v @xmath0-symmetry @xmath7 orbitals admixed with oxygen @xmath13 states ) as a multiorbital hubbard model .",
    "this approach is generally accepted @xcite as the relevant description of the early transition metal perovskites such as the systems we study here .",
    "a second approach is based on atomic - like @xmath7 orbitals which are subject to on - site correlations and are hybridized with the full @xmath14 manifold .",
    "this approach is used in the dft+u and dft+dmft @xcite approaches .",
    "it is generally believed to be essential to a correct description of the late ( e.g. cu - based or ni - based ) transition metal oxides @xcite but has been less widely used in the study of early transition metal oxides .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] is the summary and conclusion .",

    "we study systems derived from srvo@xmath3 and lavo@xmath3 .",
    "bulk srvo@xmath3 crystallizes in the ideal cubic abo@xmath3 perovskite structure.@xcite the crystal structure of lavo@xmath3 may be thought of as a cubic perovskite with an additional gdfeo@xmath3-type rotational distortion leading to a tilted structure with symmetry group @xmath16@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig : gdfeo3 ] shows the lattice structure of lavo@xmath3 .",
    "the basic structural motif of the perovskite structure is the oxygen octahedron . in the gdfeo@xmath3",

    "we now turn to the electronic structure .",
    "the large energy splitting between the transition metal @xmath7 bands and oxygen @xmath14 bands characteristic of early transition metal oxides such as la / srvo@xmath3 is generally believed@xcite to justify a downfolding to a model containing only the frontier bands , which in the present case are composed mainly of v - derived @xmath0 symmetry @xmath7 states with only a small admixture of oxygen @xmath14 states .",
    "we refer to this as the @xmath7 only model . in a subsequent section we present an examination of a more general `` charge transfer '' model in which the full @xmath14 @xmath7 complex is considered .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath7 only model is @xmath33 where @xmath34 describes the electron hopping between sites and @xmath35 describes the @xmath7 @xmath7 interactions , which we take to be on - site .",
    "the kinetic hamiltonian has the quadratic form @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are electron creation and annihilation operators in reciprocal space with wavevector @xmath39 . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are orbital indices , and @xmath42 is the spin index .    for the cubic structure , the @xmath43 describing the @xmath0-derived antibonding bands is easily constructed using phenomenological tight binding methods.@xcite for example , for calculations with only antibonding bands composed mainly of @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath43 is almost diagonal and well approximated by a two - dimensional energy dispersion with nearest neighbor hopping @xmath44 and next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath45 .",
    "the explicit form for the band arising from the @xmath46-symmetry orbital is @xmath47 and for the @xmath48-derived bands one relabels the momentum indices appropriately .    for the tilted structure , the form of @xmath43 is more difficult to express in the simple tight binding language used for the cubic perovskite structure .",
    "first , the natural basis for defining local @xmath7 orbitals is aligned with the axes of the local vo@xmath1 octahedron and so varies from site to site making the slater - kanamori procedure much more involved .",
    "second , the v - o - v bond is buckled , decreasing the hopping @xmath44 both in absolute terms and relative to @xmath45 , as well as opening many other channels of hopping from one v - site to another . for tilted structures we construct @xmath43 numerically from density functional theory ( dft ) band structure calculations using maximally - localized wannier function ( mlwf ) techniques.@xcite we have verified that when applied to the cubic structure the method reproduces the phenomenological tight binding model discussed above .",
    "we found that in the resulting mlwf band structures ( not shown ) , the bands derived from @xmath0 and oxygen @xmath14 orbitals agree very well with the dft results , but the @xmath49 antibonding bands do not because they are entangled with many other bands .",
    "however , the @xmath49 states derived from these bands are well above the fermi level and , in an appropriate local basis aligned with the symmetry axes of a vo@xmath1 octahedron , do not mix with @xmath0 bands",
    ". they therefore do not affect the final results significantly .    the on - site interaction term in the hamiltonian , @xmath35 ,",
    "is assumed to take the standard slater - kanamori form @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath6 is the on - site intra - orbital interaction , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are on - site inter - orbital interactions for electrons with the same and different spin respectively and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the exchange and pair hopping parts of the interaction . for a transition metal ion in free space",
    "the relations between these coefficients are : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57.@xcite it is generally believed that the relations also hold for the @xmath0 shell@xcite and we make this assumption here .",
    "we consider several values of @xmath6 and @xmath58 but focus most attention on the values @xmath59 and @xmath60ev .",
    "these values of @xmath6 and @xmath58 are similar to but slightly larger than those used in recent papers@xcite and are chosen to reproduce the crucial feature of the phase diagram , which is that lavo@xmath3 is a mott insulator .      to treat the on - site interaction terms we use single - site dynamical mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite which obtains the electron self - energy @xmath61 ( assumed to be site - local but dependent on spin and orbital indices ) from the solution of a quantum impurity model .",
    "we use the hybridization - expansion ctqmc solver@xcite to solve the quantum impurity model . in the present case ,",
    "the impurity model is a three - orbital model specified by the @xmath6 and @xmath58 interactions and by a hybridization function fixed by the self - consistency condition @xmath62^{-1}\\right\\}_{ii}.\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denotes the on - site green s function at vanadium site @xmath64 .    in applying the procedure to the gdfeo@xmath3-distorted structure ,",
    "it is important to formulate the impurity problem corresponding to a given v site in a local basis aligned to the v - o bond directions of the vo@xmath1 octahedron at this site .",
    "the self energy derived from solving the impurity problem for each octahedron is then rotated back to the global basis to define the lattice green s function used in the self - consistency condition .",
    "there are three advantages .",
    "first , the hybridization function is nearly diagonal in the local basis , which greatly reduces the sign problem in the quantum monte carlo solution of the impurity model .",
    "second , the @xmath0 and @xmath49 bands are clearly distinguished and well separated in the local basis , enabling removal of the @xmath49 bands from the many - body problem ( they can be neglected or treated in mean field ) so the dynamical impurity model involves three rather than five bands .",
    "third , the self - consistency conditions corresponding to the four inequivalent v - sites of @xmath16 lavo@xmath3 are related by rotations so only one impurity model needs to be solved .      in order to detect magnetic order ,",
    "one can allow for broken symmetry states in the dmft procedure and lower the temperature until an ordered state is reached . however , ordering temperatures are typically so low relative to the basic energy scales in the problem that our simulations become prohibitively expensive .",
    "we therefore compute the susceptibility which is found to have a curie - weiss form @xmath65 . extrapolation of @xmath66 to @xmath31 yields an estimate of the curie temperature @xmath2 .",

    "the sharp downturn in the wilson ratio at the lowest temperatures suggests that the decrease in intercept is a consequence of a lowered fermi liquid coherence scale and does not indicate stronger ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "we therefore conclude that for reasonable values of the bandwidth and correlation strength the crucial factor for ferromagnetism is the position of the density of states peak .",

    "[ fig : dos_bulk ] shows that it is only necessary for the density of states peak to be not too far above the fermi level .",
    "we believe that the difference arises from the `` double exchange '' physics of hund s coupling in partially filled @xmath7 shells .",
    "the hund s coupling favors high spin states , which means that hopping between two sites is optimal if the spins are parallel and is suppressed if they are not parallel .",

    "it is common to focus only on these bands , which are treated as a multiband hubbard model , while all other bands are neglected.@xcite however , it is generally believed that the fundamentally correct model of the transition metal oxides should be based on atomic - like @xmath7 orbitals coupled to weakly correlated oxygen @xmath14 states.@xcite in this section we examine the magnetic phase diagram of the vanadate system by applying the methods described in previous sections to the `` @xmath15 '' model which describes this situation and comparing the `` @xmath15 '' model results to those from the `` @xmath7 only '' model .",

    "further analysis is given in appendix  d.",
    "in this paper we have investigated the conditions under which ferromagnetism might be observed in bulk solid solutions derived from lavo@xmath3 .",
    "our theoretical studies used realistic band structures derived from maximally - localized wannier function fits to density functional ( typically pwscf / gga ) band structure calculations , along with the single - site dmft approximation which contains the local physics of partially filled orbitally degenerate @xmath7 orbitals with strong hund s coupling .",
    "our main theoretical finding is that for physically reasonable values of the hund s coupling ferromagnetism is driven mainly by density of states effects , being favored by a density of states peak lying not too high in energy .",
    "the dependence on correlation strength and carrier concentration is relatively weak except that if the correlation strength is large enough to drive a mott transition to an antiferromagnetic mott / charge transfer insulator , ferromagnetism is suppressed in the vicinity of the insulating state .",
    "an association between ferromagnetism and the density of states was previously noticed in studies of the one band hubbard model.@xcite however , there is a significant difference between ferromagnetism in the model studied here and that found in the single - band hubbard model . in the single - band hubbard model ,",
    "ferromagnetism only occurs when the dos peaks are located far below the chemical potential , and indeed very close to the lower band edge.@xcite in the orbitally degenerate , hund s coupled systems studied here , the requirements on the position of the density of states peak are substantially relaxed .",
    "we find that for physically reasonable correlation strengths , ferromagnetism can occur as long as the lowest density of states peak is at or below the fermi level of the fully polarized ferromagnetic state .",
    "the importance of orbital degeneracy and hund s coupling has been previously noted in studies of models with a semicircular ( bethe - lattice ) density of states@xcite and in the periodic anderson model@xcite but the important role played ( for reasonable values of @xmath58 ) by the near - fermi - surface density of states peaks seems not to have previously been noticed .    in the vanadate systems , the density of states",
    "is controlled by the amplitude of the gdfeo@xmath3 distortion away from the ideal cubic perovskite structure .",
    "we find that increasing the distortion amplitude favors ferromagnetism . indeed ,",
    "if the @xmath6 interaction were set to the unphysically small value @xmath120ev so that lavo@xmath3 were not a mott insulator , then the observed gdfeo@xmath3 distortion would be large enough to put the material at or very near to the ferromagnetic phase boundary .",
    "one may then ask why doping does not induce ferromagnetism in bulk solid solutions such as la@xmath4sr@xmath5vo@xmath3 .",
    "we believe that the answer is that in the physical system , the distortion amplitude and the carrier concentrations are both determined by the la / sr ratio in such a way that , as @xmath8 is varied , the distortion amplitude decreases so that the system follows a path in parameter space which remains outside the ferromagnetic region ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "we remark that while the general experience has been that the single - site dmft approximation provides a good qualitative representation of the physics , in particular of trends as material parameters are varied,@xcite its quantitative accuracy in producing magnetic phase boundaries has not been established .",
    "it is possible that single - site dmft underestimates magnetic order .",
    "the reports of ferromagnetism in vanadate superlattices@xcite where both the doping and the tilt angle may be locally large , suggests that the true ferromagnetic phase boundary may be shifted to lower tilt angle but still above the bulk lavo@xmath3 @xmath160 curve .",
    "increases in computer power and improvements in algorithms may soon make cluster dynamical mean field studies of realistic systems with orbital degeneracy and hund s coupling feasible , and it will be important to use these methods to assess the reliability of single - site dmft predictions .    the second point of materials theory is the issue of what is the relevant theoretical model .",
    "consistent with most theoretical literature on early transition metal oxides,@xcite we focused mainly on a @xmath7 only `` multiband hubbard model '' approach where the electrons in the near fermi surface @xmath7 derived bands were correlated by local @xmath161 interactions .",
    "the results are in reasonable accord with experiment .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a more generally valid description may be obtained from a model in which correlations are applied to atomic - like @xmath7 orbitals which are hybridized to the other orbitals , in particular to the oxygen @xmath14 orbitals . in this `` @xmath15 '' model approach ,",
    "a key parameter is the renormalized @xmath7 level energy , which is shifted from the band theory value by a `` double counting correction '' for which there is no generally agreed value .",
    "if the standard expression@xcite for the double counting correction is used , in the single - site dmft approximation lavo@xmath3 is found to be a ferromagnetic metal rather than an antiferromagnetic insulator and indeed the solid solution la@xmath4sr@xmath5vo@xmath3 is predicted to be ferromagnetic for a wide range of @xmath8 , in reasonable correspondence to the small @xmath6 calculation in the @xmath7 only model . if the double counting contribution is shifted such that the model for lavo@xmath3 is in its mott insulating regime , then the resulting phase diagram is very similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] for the @xmath7 only model .",
    "quantitative differences arise from the changes in density of states arising from the large renormalization of @xmath162 required to make the @xmath12 case a mott insulator and from the contribution of the ( small but non - negligible ) @xmath49 occupancy arising from the the @xmath14-@xmath7 bonding states . determining the appropriate theoretical approach for the early transition metal oxide is an important open question .",
    "our findings suggest several routes to creating ferromagnetism in artificially fabricated systems",
    ". the general aim should be to manipulate the band structure so as to move density of states peaks close to the fermi level . inducing octahedral tilts by compressive strain is an important route .",
    "further , in early transition metal oxides , increasing the @xmath14 @xmath7 hybridization clearly increases the effective @xmath7 moment and this provides a self - consistent amplification of the curie temperature .",
    "therefore manipulation of the @xmath14 @xmath7 energy difference can be used to control @xmath2 .",
    "we also observe that some transition metal oxides such as the ru - based perovskites and ruddlesden popper materials sr@xmath163ru@xmath164o@xmath165 involve holes in the @xmath0 bands and in a qualitative sense may be thought of as the particle - hole transforms of the models studied here . in this case for the physical sign of @xmath45 the van hove peaks are on the other side of the fermi level , suggesting that the theoretical models will be more likely to exhibit ferromagnetism .",
