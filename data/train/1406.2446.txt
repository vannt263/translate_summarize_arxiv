    "the incompressibility of the fluid is described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given injection and production sources .",
    "the concentration @xmath4 is governed by a convection - diffusion equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the porosity of the media and @xmath10 denotes the diffusion - dispersion tensor , which is given by @xcite @xmath11 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this formula , @xmath12 is a function of the local molecular peclet number @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are positive constants related to the porous media .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath19 for some positive constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "existence of weak or semiclassical solutions for the miscible displacement equations was studied in @xcite , and numerical analysis of the model has been done by many authors . in particular , a galerkin fem was studied by ewing and wheeler @xcite , and a galerkin - mixed fem was analyzed by douglas et al @xcite , where the galerkin method was used to solve the parabolic concentration equation and a mixed fem was applied to solve the elliptic pressure equation . for both methods ,",
    "a linearized semi - implicit euler scheme was used for the time stepping and optimal error estimates were presented roughly under the restriction @xmath23 . in @xcite , a characteristic method was applied to the parabolic concentration equation and the mixed fem was used to solve the elliptic pressure equation .",
    "optimal error estimates were established under the same condition , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "more recently , a galerkin method combined with a post - process technique was studied in @xcite , an euler  lagrange localized approximation method was studied in @xcite and a modified method of characteristics combined with mixed fem was studied in @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "error estimates were derived with certain restrictions on the grid ratio . to remove these restrictive conditions ,",
    "a new approach was introduced in @xcite to decouple the discretization errors from the temporal and spatial directions , and optimal error estimates of a galerkin - mixed fem was established without restriction on the grid ratio .",
    "the methodology of @xcite was later successfully applied to other nonlinear parabolic equations , such as the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , the thermistor equations @xcite and the navier - stokes equations @xcite . however , all the analyses presented in these works rely on the global @xmath25 regularity of the `` time - discrete solution '' ( the solution of the linearized pdes ) , which requires the permeability and porosity to be globally smooth in the miscible displacement model . in engineering computations , due to the existence of fault , filling - type karst caves or complex geological composition , the permeability and porosity are often discontinuous across some interfaces .",
    "it is desirable to solve the miscible displacement equations with discontinuous permeability and porosity by stable and accurate numerical methods . for this purpose ,",
    "numerical methods for flow in porous media with discontinuous permeability have been studied by many authors based on linear models .",
    "for example , see @xcite on the approximation of the elliptic pressure equation and see @xcite on the approximation of a parabolic pressure equation from the compressible model .",

    "a direct application of the traditional error estimates requires undesired restrictions on the grid ratio to control the numerical velocity . in order to avoid any restrictive conditions on the grid ratio",
