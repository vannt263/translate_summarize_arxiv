    "one of the most intriguing mysteries of modern physics is the principle of charge quantization . as dirac proved in 1931",
    ", the existence of only one magnetic monopole would be sufficient for all the electric charges to be multiple of a certain value @xcite . nevertheless , magnetic monopoles are yet to be found @xcite .",
    "this fact has a very important implication in electromagnetism and quantum electrodynamics : maxwell equations are not symmetric with respect to electric and magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast , it is well known that maxwell equations in free space are symmetric under duality transformations @xcite .",
    "this transformation mixes the electric and magnetic fields through a continuously varying parameter .",
    "therefore , we can define a generator of this transformation .",
    "indeed , in 1965 calkin found that the helicity of a light beam is the generator of duality transformations @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that duality symmetry is always broken for material media has mitigated the use of the helicity of light to probe light - matter interactions . in this research line ,",
    "a new finding was presented very recently in @xcite .",
    "it was proven that the macroscopic maxwell equations for isotropic and homogeneous media can be dual - symmetric if some conditions are fulfilled .",
    "microscopically , duality symmetry is still broken , but the collective effect of all the charges and currents in the medium restores the symmetry in the macroscopic approximation . in this work ,",
    "different samples were probed and the non - conservation of helicity was carefully quantified . in the same way as it happens with any other generator of symmetries , if the helicity of a light beam is preserved upon interaction with a material medium , this necessarily implies that the system is symmetric under its associated duality symmetry .",
    "we refer to these sort of media as dual.    in this paper , we propose a method to effectively convert a non - dual arbitrarily large dielectric sphere into a dual particle .",
    "this means that if we probe the system with light beams whose value of the helicity is well defined , the helicity of these light beams will be preserved upon interaction .",
    "our method to restore duality is based on an analytical description of spheres in terms of mie coefficients and multipolar modes . using a method to control the scattered field introduced in @xcite",
    ", we are able to effectively induce duality symmetry on the particle , regardless of its size and index of refraction . recently",
    ", dielectric particles are starting to gather a lot of interest in metamaterial sciences @xcite .",
    "their lack of losses , their directional properties @xcite and their ability of induce both electric and magnetic dipoles @xcite are thought to be applicable not only in metamaterials , but also in nanophotonics and stealth technology .",
    "indeed , it has been proven in recent experiments that the so - called first kerker condition of zero backward scattering can be achieved both in the microwave and optical regime @xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown in @xcite that a dual and cylindrically symmetric system has zero backscattering , whereas an anti - dual and cylindrically symmetric system has zero forward scattering , although this last one could only be achieved with active particles @xcite",
    "in this section , we will provide the reader with the basic concepts and formulae necessary to understand the methods used in the forthcoming sections . to begin with",
    ", we will introduce the generator of duality transformations - the helicity .",
    "the helicity is defined as the projection of the angular momentum ( am ) onto the normalized linear momentum , _ i.e. _ @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it can also be expressed for monochromatic fields as a differential operator : @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it has two eigenvectors with respective eigenvalues @xmath2 and it commutes with all the components of the linear and am operators , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "finally , in the fourier space , the helicity measures the handedness in all the plane waves .",
    "if all the plane waves have the same circular polarization with respect to their own propagation direction , then the beam will have a well defined helicity , otherwise it will not .",
    "now , since we will be working with the scattering of spheres , we will use the generalized lorenz - mie theory ( glmt ) to solve the scattering problem @xcite .",
    "the glmt solves the interaction between an arbitrary incident em field propagating in a lossless , homogeneous , isotropic medium and a homogeneous isotropic sphere .",
    "the problem is described with three em fields : the incident ( @xmath5 ) on one hand , and the scattered ( @xmath6 ) as well as the interior ( @xmath7 ) on the other hand .",
    "the three fields in the problem are decomposed into multipolar modes @xmath8 and then the boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the multipolar modes are a complete basis of maxwell equations and they are particularly suitable for problems with spherical symmetry .",
    "they are eigenvectors of the total am operator @xmath9 and one of its projections such as @xmath10 , with respective values @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they are eigenvectors of the parity operator @xmath13 with values @xmath14 for a @xmath15 parity , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for magnetic and electric multipole",
    ".    we will excite the dielectric spheres with cylindrically symmetric beams , _",
    "i.e _ excitation beams @xmath5 with a well defined value of the z component of the am , @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we will also want our beams to have a well - defined helicity value , so that it can be easily characterized if the particle is dual or not by computing the helicity transfer from the incident component to the opposite one .",
    "the decomposition of these beams into multipoles can be done analytically when they are paraxial @xcite , or semi - analytically in the general case @xcite .",
    "once the decomposition of the incident beam is found , the expression of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is given by the glmt . actually , the formal expression of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is almost the same one as @xmath5 .",
    "the only difference comes from the fact that each of the multipolar modes is modulated by a coefficient that depends on its am and parity .",
    "these are the so - called mie coefficients @xcite . also , it is worth noticing that in order to fulfil the boundary conditions the radial functions in the multipolar modes of the scattered field must be hankel functions , while in both the incident and interior fields are bessel functions @xcite .",
    "the general expression for the three fields in the problem is the following one : @xmath20   \\\\ { \\mathbf{e}^\\mathrm{sca}}&=&\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=\\vert m_z \\vert}^{\\infty } i^j ( 2j+1)^{1/2 }   c_{jm_zp } \\left [ b_j\\textbf{a}_{jm_z}^{(m)}+ipa_j\\textbf{a}_{jm_z}^{(e ) } \\right ]   \\\\ { \\mathbf{e}^\\mathrm{int}}&=&\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=\\vert m_z \\vert}^{\\infty } i^j ( 2j+1)^{1/2 } c_{jm_zp } \\left [ c_j\\textbf{a}_{jm_z}^{(m)}+ipd_j\\textbf{a}_{jm_z}^{(e ) } \\right ] \\end{array } \\label{fields}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the helicity of the incident beam , @xmath12 is the angular momentum projection on the @xmath22 axis of the incident beam , and @xmath23 is a function that modulates the multipolar content of the incident field . as such ,",
    "@xmath23 is a function of the incident beam properties : @xmath12 and @xmath24 , but also its transversal momentum profile .",
    "the mathematical expression for @xmath23 is given in @xcite .",
    "the mie coefficients @xmath25 only depend on the size parameter of the problem ( @xmath26 ) , the relative permeability ( @xmath27 ) and permittivity ( @xmath28 ) of the sphere with respect to the surrounding medium . here ,",
    "@xmath29 is the radius of the particle and @xmath30 the wavelength in free space .",
    "now , as it has been discussed and proven in @xcite , it is crucial to note that even though the incident field has a well - defined helicity , the scattered and interior fields do not generally have it .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the two pairs of mie coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not generally equal .",
    "in fact , we can split the total energy of the scattered field ( @xmath33 ) on a control sphere into two parts .",
    "these two parts account for the energy scattered in modes with the same helicity as the incident field ( @xmath34 ) and with the opposite helicity ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 note that in general the scattered field will always carry energy in modes with the opposite helicity , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath37 . however , if @xmath38 the particle only scatters energy with the same helicity as the incident beam , conserving the helicity of the electromagnetic ( em ) field and therefore behaving as a dual medium . note also that if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the scattered field has the opposite helicity to the incident one .",
    "we refer to such scatterers as anti - dual @xcite .",
    "it can be proven that a spherical particle will only be dual if @xmath41 .",
    "also , as it has been stated in the introduction , it has been proven that a dielectric material can not be anti - dual @xcite and that such materials could only be made of active media @xcite .",
    "these two facts have been experimentally verified in the dipolar approximation @xcite , experimentally achieving @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "below we show how to extend those conditions to other regimes and also we show that there are situations where one can even approximately fulfil the anti - dual condition .",
    "in this section we propose a method to induce duality symmetry on dielectric spheres .",
    "our method is based on the following idea .",
    "suppose that we have a single isotropic and homogeneous dielectric sphere with a given size @xmath29 and index of refraction relative to the surrounding medium @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetic permeability can be set to 1 for simplicity .",
    "we will describe the em response of the sphere with the glmt . now let s suppose that the behaviour of the particle could be described by only two mie coefficients of the same order @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a certain range of the size parameter @xmath47 .",
    "if in that range @xmath45 is equal to @xmath46 , then the particle will be dual @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the em response of a particle can not usually be only described with two mie coefficients . and even when that is the case , it is not clear that @xmath45 can be equal to @xmath46 in that regime .",
    "for example , in the dipolar or rayleigh approximation @xcite , the em response of the particle can be described with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "nonetheless , the dipolar approximation is only valid for @xmath50 .",
    "that is , if we fix the size of the particle , the approximation will only be valid for wavelengths such that @xmath51 . in this regime ,",
    "the electric dipolar moment is typically much larger than the magnetic one .",
    "then , if there are certain values of the parameters where @xmath52 , we would still have to validate that all the higher multipolar moments are small .",
    "( in red ) and @xmath53 ( in blue ) for @xmath54 in a ) , b ) and c ) , respectively as a function of the size parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the relative index of refraction is @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen that all of them start being significantly different from zero when @xmath57 .",
    "[ ajbj],width=340 ]    in this section , we will show that by using cylindrically symmetric modes , a particle can be described with only two mie coefficients ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) for certain regimes .",
    "also , we will show that the duality condition @xmath58 can be achieved for arbitrary large @xmath59 .",
    "this duality condition is achieved in three steps . in the first place , the lower @xmath60 mie coefficients are not excited .",
    "then , the excitation wavelength is chosen so that @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we only choose the situations where the helicity change due to the higher order mie coefficients is negligible .    in order to fulfill this program",
    ", we will first describe the behaviour of the mie coefficients for dielectric particles , _",
    "i.e. _ when the relative index of refraction @xmath44 is real , in order to get a deeper understanding of the phenomena involved . in this case , the mie coefficients , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , that is the multipolar moments of the sphere , are complex and their absolute values are bounded between zero and one , @xmath63 .",
    "a multipolar moment of order @xmath59 is very close to zero for small @xmath47 , and they start to grow for a value of @xmath47 which is proportional to the order of the mode @xmath59 .",
    "the proportionality value depends on @xmath44 .",
    "for example , when @xmath56 , it can be computationally verified that the mie coefficients approximately start to grow when @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . then , if @xmath64 the multipolar moments of order @xmath59 are negligible . for @xmath65 their absolute values",
    "oscillate between 0 and 1 .",
    "hence , on one hand , it is always true that it exists an interval around @xmath66 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 start growing and the higher mie coefficients are approximately zero ( as they start growing for @xmath67 ) .",
    "but on the other hand , it is impossible that all the first @xmath60 mie coefficients are zero when @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not , as they start growing for smaller @xmath47 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are plotted for @xmath54 . it can be observed that all the mie coefficients follow the pattern described above : their absolute value is 0 until @xmath57 , and then they oscillate between 0 and 1 .",
    "because of this behaviour , it would seem that condition @xmath58 can not be met .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that the first @xmath60 mie coefficients ( and its associated multipolar modes ) can be removed from the scattered field when a beam with @xmath68 is used to illuminate a sphere .",
    "this is a consequence of the conservation rules for the am .",
    "thus , we can isolate an arbitrary pair of mie coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 around @xmath57 : the first @xmath60 mie modes can be removed from the scattering using a beam with @xmath68 , and the higher modes are naturally attenuated .",
    "the only remaining point that needs to be discussed is the helicity change induced by the higher order modes .",
    "as we have stated previously , if a light beam with @xmath68 is used , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are going to be the dominant mie modes around @xmath57 .",
    "however , generally the condition @xmath69 will be met for a particle such that @xmath70 . if this value @xmath71 is close to @xmath72 , the mie coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 can not be ignored .",
    "thus , as stated above , what needs to be carefully studied is the helicity change induced by @xmath73 , @xmath74 and the higher orders when the condition @xmath58 is met .",
    "this is studied in the next subsections for spheres of different sizes and materials .",
    "the wavelength will be fixed at @xmath75 nm unless the contrary is stated .       as a function of the radius of the sphere @xmath29 ( horizontal axis ) and the relative index of refraction @xmath44 ( vertical axis ) .",
    "it can be observed that there are three major regions where @xmath76 .",
    "[ a1b1],width=529 ]    in this subsection , our method to induce duality symmetry in a dielectric sphere is tested with a gaussian beam . nonetheless , in order to get some intuition , we first plot @xmath77 as a function of the radius of the particle @xmath29 , and the relative index of refraction @xmath44 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "it can be observed that for any value of the refractive index , multiple radius of the sphere satisfy @xmath78 .",
    "this is a consequence of the oscillating behaviour of the mie coefficients seen in fig .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the larger the refractive index is , the smaller the particle is when @xmath79 . nonetheless , looking at fig .",
    "2 , one does not know how good the approximation of only describing the sphere with the @xmath48 and @xmath49 is - we are missing all the information due to the higher modes . to capture this behaviour",
    ", we define the transfer function @xmath80 : @xmath81 this function gives the fraction of scattered light going to modes with opposite helicity with respect to the incident light ( @xmath35 ) , compared with the fraction of scattered light going to modes with the same helicity ( @xmath82 ) , for a given angular momentum ( @xmath12 ) and helicity ( @xmath24 ) of the incident beam .",
    "hence , @xmath83 varies from 0 to infinity .",
    "when @xmath80 tends to zero , the particle is dual and all the scattered light has helicity @xmath24 : in other words , it fulfils the first generalized kerker condition @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath83 tends to infinity , the particle is anti - dual and all the scattering is transferred to the cross helicity , @xmath84 : it fulfils the generalized second kerker condition @xcite .     of the transfer function @xmath83 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath87 , as a function of the radius @xmath29 of the particle ( horizontal axis ) and the relative index of refraction @xmath44 ( vertical axis ) .",
    "the radius of the particle is varied from 100 nm ( left ) to 300 nm ( right ) and the relative index of refraction goes from @xmath88 .",
    "[ t11],width=529 ]    figure [ t11 ] shows the value of @xmath87 , i.e. for a focused gaussian beam with well defined helicity .",
    "we use the same range of parameters , @xmath89 , used in fig .",
    "the logarithm is applied to stand out the dual behaviour of the particle .",
    "it can be observed that now there is only one region in the @xmath90 space where the dual condition is fulfilled , in contrast to fig .",
    "[ a1b1 ] where three different regions had @xmath91 .",
    "this fact was expected due to the behaviour of the mie coefficients explained in fig .",
    "indeed , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the higher orders are no longer negligible for large values of @xmath29 and therefore they induce a helicity transfer from @xmath24 to @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to see how the induced duality strongly depends on the relative index of refraction .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ t11 ] that the dielectric sphere gets closer to the dual condition when @xmath44 gets larger .",
    "that means that the helicity of the incoming beam will be better preserved when particles with a high refractive index embedded in a low refractive index medium are used .",
    "in addition to the duality considerations mentioned above , fig . 3 also depicts the anti - dual behaviour of the particle .",
    "two main features can be observed .",
    "first , as it can be deduced from the colorbar , the anti - dual condition is not achieved as finely as the dual is .",
    "that is , the generalized second kerker condition is more difficult to achieve . hence , the forward scattering is never reduced as much as the backward is .",
    "this is consistent with the few experiments done until now @xcite and with the fact that dielectric particles can not be anti - dual @xcite .",

    "as mentioned earlier , this will depend not only on the eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath24 , but also on its transversal properties .",
    "in particular , the value of the amplitudes @xmath23 will vary depending on how much the beam is focused @xcite .",
    "an example is provided by fig .",
    "[ cjmzp ] . in fig .",
    "[ cjmzp](a ) , a circularly polarized gaussian beam is focused with two different numerical apertures ( na ) . in yellow ,",

    "hence , we will use the same na@xmath98 for the rest of the article .",

    "however , as we did in the previous subsection , the helicity change induced by the mie modes whose order is higher than @xmath105 has to be carefully studied .     as a function of the radius @xmath29 of the particle ( horizontal axis ) and the relative index of refraction @xmath44 ( vertical axis ) .",

    "5(a ) has a similar shape to @xmath110 , some differences can be found .",
    "the range of sizes for the particles to achieve the dual condition @xmath111 has increased for the same interval of @xmath112 $ ] . before , it spanned 200 nm , whereas now it spans 500 nm .",
    "as previously discussed , though , this plot does not enables us to see how dual - symmetric ( or anti - dual ) the particle is .",
    "therefore , we have plotted @xmath113 in fig .",
    "5(b ) to capture this behaviour . as in the @xmath114 case , an increase in @xmath44",
    "is linked to an increase of the dual properties of the sphere .",
    "also , it can be inferred from a comparison between fig .",
    "5(b ) and fig .",
    "3 , the dual and anti - dual conditions are fulfilled with a better approximation in this new occasion .",
    "indeed , the minimum value of the colorbar drops almost an order of magnitude , and the maximum value increases more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "that is , for some certain combinations of @xmath29 and @xmath44 , the energy of the scattered field in the modes of opposite helicity is @xmath115 times smaller than the energy going to the original helicity of the incident field ; whereas for some other certain conditions , the scattered field energy is dominated by modes with the opposite helicity with a ratio of 500 to 1 . as in the incident",
    "gaussian beam case , an increase in @xmath44 is linked to an increase of the dual and anti - dual properties of the sphere .",
    "to summarize , some very general conclusions can be reached after a careful look into these results :    * the larger the relative refraction index of the particle @xmath44 is , the more accurately the two generalized kerker conditions can be achieved . * for a constant @xmath44 , the bigger the particle is , the more dual ( and anti - dual ) the particle can become if high am modes at the adequate wavelength are used to excite it .",
    "* fixing the index of refraction and size of the particle , we can always approximately induce the duality symmetry by choosing a right combination of am and optical frequency of our laser , regardless of how big the sphere is with respect to the wavelength .",
    "we have confirmed these conclusions by doing calculations similar to the ones presented with different sizes , wavelengths , refractive indexes , and excitation beams .",
    "the results are always consistent with the conclusion above .",
    "finally , note that in our simulations @xmath116 and @xmath117 nm . with these two conditions , the smallest",
    "a particle can be to induce duality symmetry is 120 nm . this size could be reduced down to 81 nm if a @xmath118 nm was used .",
    "in the previous section , we have compared different scenarios where the em duality symmetry can be induced with dielectric spheres and arbitrarily high am modes .",
    "we have seen that it is possible to induce dual and anti - dual behaviours for certain incident beams @xmath5 , regardless of the nature of the particle . in this section ,",
    "we quantify two hypothetical experiments that are feasible in the laboratory where the duality condition can be achieved .",
    "we will consider spheres made of silica and alumina .",
    "their respective refractive indexes at @xmath75 nm are @xmath119 @xcite and @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "we will suppose that they are embedded in water , therefore their respective relative refractive index will be @xmath121 and @xmath122 . the way to proceed to induce helicity conservation will be the following .",
    "we consider the particle and its embedding medium as a given system .",
    "then , we will see that we can achieve helicity conservation regardless of the nature of the particle ( size and index of refraction ) , as long as it is approximately spherical , the surrounding medium is homogeneous , lossless and isotropic , and considering a tunable laser with a broad enough wavelength modulation .",
    "once the two parameters @xmath29 and @xmath44 are known , we can always compute the range of size parameters @xmath47 that could be achieved with a tunable laser .",
    "supposing that the tunable laser can offer wavelengths spanning from 700 nm to 1000 nm ( that would be the case of a ti : sapphire laser , for example ) , the achievable @xmath47 will belong to the interval @xmath123 .",
    "now , as it has been proven in the previous section , there also exist a large number of radii @xmath124 ( and consequently , @xmath125 ) for which the dual condition is achieved .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that given @xmath44 , there exist different radius of particles @xmath126 that make the particle dual provided adequate excitation beams with angular momentum @xmath12 are used .",
    "hence it is highly probable that regardless of @xmath29 and @xmath44 the dual condition @xmath58 can be achieved .",
    "in fact , this statement is even more true inasmuch as @xmath29 gets bigger . to be more specific ,",
    "suppose that we have four different spheres .",
    "two of them are made of silica and the other two are made of alumina .",
    "for each of the materials , suppose that the radius of the spheres are @xmath127 nm and @xmath128 nm . now , given these sizes and their respective index of refraction , we can transform the @xmath29 dependence on the x axis in fig . 3 and fig .",

    "it can be observed that regardless of the size and the material , the duality condition can be achieved if a proper excitation beam is used .",
    "moreover , we see that when the particle is larger , we need higher order beams to reach the duality condition , as long as we want to use visible wavelengths .",
    "finally , it can also be observed that when the relative refractive index @xmath44 is increased , the duality condition is pushed to longer wavelengths .",

    "we have shown that the em duality symmetry can be induced in dielectric spheres thanks to the use of higher am modes .",
    "our results show that the increase of relative index of refraction @xmath44 of the sphere and the order @xmath12 of the am mode of the incoming beam help to achieve a dual sphere .",
