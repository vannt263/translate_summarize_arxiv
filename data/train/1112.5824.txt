    "wire array z - pinches proved to be one of the most efficient and practical way to generate multi - terawatt pulses of quasi - thermal x - rays with duration of a few nanoseconds @xcite .",
    "this implies reach potential for many applications , in particular , as an attractive driver for inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite . from theoretical point of view",
    ", the wire array z - pinch is a complex physical phenomenon : its adequate modelling requires sophisticated multi - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of a complex plasma - metal configuration , whose dynamics at a later stage is strongly influenced by radiative processes @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is on a single specific aspect of this phenomenon , namely , on the physics of conversion of the kinetic energy of the imploding pinch into the emerging pulse of x - rays .",
    "we solve an idealized one - dimensional ( 1d ) problem where a high - velocity cylindrical implosion of tungsten plasma is stopped according to the laws of pure radiation hydrodynamics , with a possible role of mhd effects neglected .",
    "we believe that , despite a seemingly oversimplified statement of the problem , thus obtained results will prove to be useful for interpretation and subsequent modelling of the x - ray pulses and their spectra in wire array z - pinches optimized for maximum x - ray power .",
    "the emission that we calculate should primarily refer to the main part of the observed pulses , i.e.   to the x - ray flux in a narrow time window around the peak of the x - ray power with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) roughly equal to its rise time ( @xmath1  ns in a typical 1819  ma shot on the z machine at sandia @xcite ) .",
    "note that thus defined main pulse may only contain about 50% of the total x - ray emitted energy @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the assumption that practically all the energy radiated in the main pulse originates from the kinetic energy of the imploding plasma .",
    "such a premise is corroborated by the latest 3d mhd simulations of imploding wire arrays @xcite . to simplify the treatment",
    ", we do not consider the acceleration stage of the plasma implosion and start with an initial state at maximum implosion velocity .",
    "hence , we do not have to consider the @xmath2 force which drives the implosion ( i.e.  accelerates the plasma but generates little entropy ) because the entire kinetic energy of the implosion can be simply prescribed at the initial state .",
    "the resistive ( ohmic ) dissipation of the electromagnetic energy was found to be negligible anyway @xcite .",
    "more difficult is to justify our neglect of the mhd effects at the final stage of plasma deceleration and x - ray generation .",
    "although some additional arguments to this point are given in the summary , we must admit that full clarification of this issue remains for future work .",
    "under the assumptions made , we find that the kinetic energy of the implosion is converted into radiation when the plasma passes through a stagnation shock near the axis . in wire arrays with powerful x - ray emission",
    "the stagnation shock falls into the category of `` supercritical '' radiation - dominated ( rd ) shock fronts @xcite .",
    "such fronts are characterized by an extremely small width , and their thermal structure is primarily controlled by emission and transport of thermal radiation .",
    "our results imply that adequate modelling of the temperature and density profiles across the narrow stagnation shock front is key to understanding the x - ray spectra emitted by powerful wire array z - pinches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : pr ] we describe the initial state of the simulated plasma flow ; section  [ s : code ] elaborates on the two numerical codes used for simulations .",
    "section  [ s : shock ] is devoted to the detailed analysis of the stagnation shock structure : we construct an approximate analytical model , which is corroborated by numerical simulations and allows simple evaluation of the key plasma parameters in the shock front . in section  [ s : ph ]",
    "we present the calculated spectra of the x - ray pulses , radial profiles of the spectral optical depth , spectral x - ray images of the plasma column .",
    "the emergent x - ray spectra have been calculated for two values of the linear pinch mass , 0.3  mg  @xmath0 and 6  mg  @xmath0 , by employing a newly developed two - dimensional ( 2d ) radiation - hydrodynamics code ralef-2d .",
    "we choose the simplest initial configuration that allows reproduction of the principal characteristics of the observed x - ray pulses .",
    "we start with a cylindrical shell of tungsten plasma , converging onto the pinch axis @xmath3 with an initial implosion velocity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) constant over the shell mass .",
    "the imploding shell is supposed to have sharp boundaries at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "once the radial velocity peaks at @xmath8 , the implosion can be treated as `` cold '' in the sense that the plasma internal energy is small compared to its kinetic energy , the role of pressure forces is negligible , and the shell thickness freezes at a constant value @xmath9 .",
    "we begin our simulations at time @xmath10 when the inner shell edge arrives upon the axis , i.e.  when @xmath11 .",
    "the density distribution across the imploding shell is assumed to have been uniform at earlier times , when the inner shell radius was @xmath12 . in a cold implosion",
    "this leads to the initial radial density profile of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the linear ( per unit cylinder length ) mass of the shell .    in this paper we present simulations for two cases , namely , case  a ( referring to the 5-ma angara-5 - 1 machine in troitsk , russia ) and case  z ( referring to the 20-ma z accelerator at sandia , usa ) . in both cases we used the same values of the implosion velocity and shell thickness , @xmath15 the peak implosion velocity of 400  km  s@xmath16 has been inferred from the experimental data for optimized shots on both the angara-5 - 1 @xcite and the z machines @xcite , and confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite . for the given @xmath8 , the shell thickness @xmath9 is set equal to 2  mm to conform with the observed x - ray pulse duration of 5  ns ( fwhm ) @xcite . note that if , in addition , we assumed a 100% instantaneous conversion of the kinetic energy into x - rays , we would obtain a rectangular x - ray pulse of duration @xmath17 with the top nominal power @xmath18 ( per unit cylinder length ) .    thus , the only parameter that differs between the cases a and z is the linear mass @xmath14 of the imploding shell . in simulations we used the values",
    "@xmath19 which are representative of a series of optimized ( with respect to the peak power and total energy of the x - ray pulse ) experiments at a 3  ma current level on angara-5 - 1 @xcite , and at a 19  ma current level on z @xcite .",
    "these two values of @xmath14 correspond to the nominal powers @xmath20 which are close to the peak x - ray powers measured in the corresponding experiments .",
    "the final parameter needed to fully specify the initial state is the initial temperature @xmath21 of the imploding plasma . in both cases",
    "we used the same value @xmath22  ev , which falls in the 1030  ev range inferred from the theory of plasma ablation in multi - wire arrays @xcite and confirmed by direct mhd simulations of the wire - corona plasma @xcite .",
    "the sound velocity in a 20-ev tungsten plasma , @xmath23  cm  s@xmath16 , implies implosion mach numbers as high as @xmath2480  which fully justifies the above assumption of a cold implosion .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed with two numerical codes that are based on different numerical techniques and include fully independent models of all physical processes , namely , with a 1d three - temperature ( 3 t ) code @xcite , and a 2d radiation - hydrodynamics code ralef-2d @xcite . because of strongly differing physical models and numerical capabilities , the results obtained with these two codes are to a large extent complimentary to one another .",
    "the 2d code was used to simulate our 1d problem simply because we had no adequate 1d code with spectral radiation transport at hand .",
    "the 1d 3 t code was originally written to simulate icf targets @xcite .",
    "it is based on one - fluid lagrangian hydrodynamics with a tensor version of the richtmyer artificial viscosity and different electron , @xmath25 , and ion , @xmath26 , temperatures .",
    "included also are the electron and the ion thermal conduction , as well as the ion physical viscosity .",
    "the model for the electron and the ion conduction coefficients is based on the spitzer formula , modified in such a way as to match the experimental data near normal conditions @xcite .",

    "the absorption coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are evaluated in - line as a combined contribution from the free - free , bound - free and bound - bound electron transitions plus the thomson scattering . for the bound - bound and bound - free transitions , an approximate model , based on the sum rule for the dipole oscillator strengths @xcite , is used .",
    "the subset of the three energy equations is solved in a fully implicit manner by linearizing with respect to the three unknown temperatures @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath28 .",

    "the original mesh rezoning scheme , based on the winslow equipotential method @xcite , proved to be quite efficient for the interior of the computational domain , if the mesh is smooth along the boundaries ; in ralef , a new high - order method for rezoning block boundaries has been implemented to this end .",

    "correct transition to the diffusion limit is achieved by special combination of the first- and second - order interpolation schemes in the finite - difference approximations to equations  ( [ eq : r - transp= ] ) and ( [ eq : q_r= ] ) .",
    "more details on the numerical scheme for radiation transfer are to be published elsewhere .    in the present work we used the equation of state , thermal conductivity and spectral opacities provided by the code @xcite , which has been developed at the keldysh institute of applied mathematics ( moscow ) .",
    "the spectral opacities are generated by solving the hatree - fock - slater equations for plasma ions under the assumption of equilibrium level population . in combination with the equilibrium planckian intensity @xmath41 , used in ( [ eq : r - transp= ] ) as the source function",

    "[ f : deia ] and [ f : deiz ] this discontinuity is smeared out ( roughly over 3 mesh cells ) by the artificial richtmyer - type viscosity , present in the code .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath25 , which exhibits a prominent hump over the virtually constant radiation temperature @xmath28 , is continuous because the electron thermal conduction plays a significant role .",

    "( colour online ) density and temperature profiles across the stagnation shock in case  a as calculated with the code for @xmath68  ns .",
    "the effective width @xmath71 of the shock front is defined as the fwhm of the local peak of the electron temperature @xmath25 . the velocity profile in the shock frame",
    "can be easily restored from the density plot and the condition @xmath76 , which is quite accurately observed in the displayed region.,width=302 ]     ( colour online ) same as figure  [ f : deia ] but for case  z.,width=302 ]    figures  [ f : deia ] and [ f : deiz ] demonstrate prominent peaks of the ion temperature @xmath26 , whose maximum values @xmath77  kev significantly exceed the peak electron temperature @xmath78 . this fact , however , turns out to be rather insignificant for the radiative properties of the imploding plasma . indeed , if we assume that the kinetic energy of the infalling plasma is fully converted into the ion thermal energy within a density - temperature discontinuity and ignore the plasma preheating before the shock , we calculate an after - shock ion temperature of @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the adiabatic index of the ideal gas of plasma ions , @xmath81 is the mass of a tungsten ion .",
    "the simulations demonstrate much lower peak ion temperatures because the preheating of the pre - shock plasma electrons , followed by their adiabatic compression in the density jump , consumes a large portion of the initial ion kinetic energy ( in a collisionless manner via ambipolar electric fields ) . as a consequence , even before the collisional electron - ion relaxation sets in , the post - shock electrons with a temperature of @xmath82  kev already contain almost twice as much energy as the post - shock ions with a temperature of @xmath83  kev .",
    "hence , the subsequent collisional electron - ion relaxation does not significantly affect the @xmath25 profile .",
    "this fact has also been verified directly : having performed additional runs in the 2 t mode ( i.e.  assuming @xmath84 ) , we obtained @xmath69 profiles that were hardly distinguishable from the @xmath25 profiles in figures  [ f : deia ] and [ f : deiz ] ( the difference between the peak values @xmath85 and @xmath78 did not exceed 3% ) .",
    "thus , the approximation of a single matter temperature @xmath86 , used in the 2d code , is well justified for our problem .      the theory of rd shock fronts , developed by yu .",
    "raizer @xcite and described in his book with ya .",
    "b.  zeldovich @xcite , applies to planar shock waves in an infinite medium , which eventually absorbs all the emitted photons .",
    "we , in contrast , are dealing with a finite plasma mass , which lets out practically all the radiation flux generated at the shock front .",
    "in addition , the electron heat conduction , ignored in raizer s treatment , plays an important role in formation of the temperature profile across the shock front .",
    "hence , we have to reconsider certain key aspects of the raizer s theory in order to obtain an adequate model for the stagnation shock in imploding z - pinch plasma .",
    "to construct an analytical model of the plasma flow , we have to make certain simplifying assumptions .",
    "first of all , we assume a single temperature @xmath69 for ions and electrons and employ the ideal - gas equation of state in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the pressure , @xmath89 is the mass - specific internal energy , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constants .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the tungsten plasma in the relevant range of temperatures and densities are reasonably well reproduced with @xmath92    at each time @xmath93 the entire plasma flow can be divided into three zones : the inner stagnation zone ( the compressed core ) at @xmath94 behind the shock front , the shock front itself confined to a narrow layer around @xmath95 , and the outer layer of the unshocked infalling material at @xmath96 . in the stagnation zone the plasma velocity is small compared to @xmath8 , while the temperature and density are practically uniform and have the final post - shock values of @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "because the plasma flow in the stagnation zone is subsonic , pressure is rapidly equalized by hydrodynamics , while temperature is equalized by efficient radiative heat conduction ; note that typical values of the mean rosseland optical thickness of the stagnant core lie in the range @xmath99100 .",
    "numerical simulations confirm that spatial density and temperature variations across the compressed core do not exceed a few percent .",
    "we identify the shock radius @xmath100 with the density ( and velocity ) discontinuity , which is always present in sufficiently strong shocks once a zero physical viscosity is assumed @xcite . here and below the term `` shock front ''",
    "is applied to a narrow layer with an effective width of @xmath101 , where the matter ( electron ) temperature @xmath69 exhibits a noticeable hump above the radiation temperature @xmath28 ; see figures  [ f : deia ] and [ f : deiz ] . outside the shock front at @xmath102 lies a broad preheating zone , which extends virtually over the entire unshocked material and has a width well in excess of the shock radius @xmath103 . in this region",
    "the infalling plasma is preheated due to interaction with the outgoing radiation ; in the process , it is also partially decelerated and compressed .    to analyze the structure of the shock front , we use the three basic conservation laws @xmath104 governing a steady - state hydrodynamic flow without viscosity across a planar shock front @xcite ; here @xmath105 is the specific enthalpy , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the energy fluxes due , respectively , to the electron thermal conduction and radiation transport . equations ( [ bal - m=])([bal - e= ] ) are written in the reference frame comoving with the shock front : in this frame the plasma velocity @xmath108 . to avoid confusion , we use symbol `` @xmath109 '' for the plasma velocity in the shock frame , and symbol `` @xmath110 '' for the plasma velocity in the laboratory frame .",
    "the velocity of the shock front in the laboratory frame is @xmath111 .",
    "clearly , the planar conservation laws ( [ bal - m=])([bal - e= ] ) can be applied over a narrow front zone with @xmath112 but not across the broad preheating zone , where the effects of cylindrical convergence become significant .",
    "we begin by deriving a system of equations , from which the parameters of the stagnant plasma core can be evaluated .",
    "although the sought - for quantities formally depend on time @xmath93 , time appears only as a parameter in the final equations .",
    "the final post - shock plasma state can be determined in the approximation of zero thermal conduction , which redistributes energy only locally , in the immediate vicinity of the shock front . without thermal conduction ,",
    "the density and the temperature should have profiles shown qualitatively in figure  [ f : rdshock ] : the density jump from @xmath113 to @xmath114 is accompanied by the jump in temperature from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "immediately behind ( in the downstream direction ) the temperature peak @xmath117 lies a narrow relaxation zone to the final state @xmath118 , where the excess thermal energy between the @xmath117 and @xmath119 states is rapidly radiated away .",

    "how does @xmath121 compare with @xmath119 , depends on whether the rd shock is subcritical or supercritical .",
    "a critical amplitude of an rd shock front corresponds to the condition @xcite @xmath122 that the one - sided radiation energy flux @xmath123 becomes comparable to the hydrodynamic energy flux @xmath124 behind the shock front ; here @xmath125 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . in our case",
    "the rd shock becomes supercritical when the post - shock temperature exceeds the critical value of @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the initial density ( [ rho_0= ] ) at @xmath128 in g  @xmath45 .",

    "raizer @xcite , when a supercritical rd shock wave propagates in an infinite medium , it has @xmath129 .",
    "if the optical thickness of the unshocked material is not exceedingly small , this is also true in the case of a finite plasma size ; the latter applies to all configurations considered in this paper and is directly confirmed by the profiles in figures  [ f : deia ] and [ f : deiz ] .    to avoid treatment of the non - planar preheating zone",
    ", we make a simplifying assumption that partial deceleration of the infalling plasma in the preheating zone can be neglected , i.e.  that one can set @xmath130 and @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is calculated from ( [ rho_0= ] ) at @xmath128 , and @xmath133 is the plasma velocity at the entrance into the jump in the shock front frame . as is demonstrated in  16 of chapter  vii in @xcite , for @xmath134 this approximation is accurate to the second order with respect to the small parameter @xmath135 in fact , it has already been used in condition ( [ crit= ] ) .",

    "a subtle point here is that we can not directly use equation ( [ bal - e= ] ) of the energy balance across the shock front .",
    "quasi - uniform density and temperature profiles in the stagnation core ensue from the rapid redistribution of thermal energy over the entire mass of this zone by means of radiation .",

    "we analyzed the structure of the stagnation rd shock by using two independent radiation - hydrodynamics codes , and by constructing an approximate analytical model .",

    "the hard component of the x - ray spectrum with a blackbody temperature of @xmath2600.6  kev is shown to originate from a narrow peak of the electron temperature inside the rd stagnation shock .",
    "our approximate model clarifies how the width and the amplitude of this temperature peak depend on the imploding plasma parameters .",
    "the softer main component of the x - ray pulse is generated in an extended halo around the stagnation shock , where the primary emission from the shock front is absorbed and reemitted by the outer layers of the imploding plasma .    in reality ,",
    "due to flow non - uniformities , the narrow front of the stagnation shock will almost certainly have a much more irregular shape than in the present 1d picture .",
    "but its main characteristics  the transverse thickness @xmath71 and the peak electron temperature @xmath78  are controlled by the plasma flow parameters ( the implosion velocity @xmath8 , the mass flux density @xmath261 , the plasma thermal conductivity @xmath180 and the spectral absorption coefficient @xmath42 ) that are not expected to be dramatically affected by moderate flow perturbations .",
