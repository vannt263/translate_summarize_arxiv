    "the development of thermoelectric devices for the efficient conversion of heat into electrical energy or for refrigeration would be an important step towards a more environmentally friendly use of energy .",
    "engineered nanostructures are promising materials in this respect,@xcite and molecular junctions are presently moving into the focus of research.@xcite they seem to be good candidates for achieving high thermoelectric figures of merit as a result of the discrete energy level structure of the molecules@xcite and because molecular properties can be controlled by chemical synthesis .",
    "already the measurement of the thermopower alone provides important insights into the electronic structure of molecular junctions , not accessible by conductance measurements.@xcite thus , electron and hole conduction can be distinguished@xcite and the alignment of molecular levels with respect to the fermi energy can be determined.@xcite it turns out that the experiments are described by a combination of electronic structure and transport calculations.@xcite for instance , the linear increase of the thermopower with molecule length in the typical off - resonant transport situation has been found in both experiment@xcite and theory.@xcite    while molecular junctions appear promising from a device - oriented point of view , metallic electrodes are typically used to contact the molecules.@xcite metallic atomic contacts hence constitute important reference systems . until now their thermopower has been studied experimentally in the single - atom contact regime only by ludoph and van ruitenbeek.@xcite the authors discuss mostly their results for au contacts , but measurements for ag and cu contacts have been performed as well.@xcite    motivated by pioneering experiments with high - mobility two - dimensional electron gases,@xcite theoretical studies have described the thermopower of quantum point contacts in two and three dimensions using the free - electron - gas approximation for adiabatic constrictions.@xcite indeed , such studies have successfully predicted maxima of the thermopower at the transition between quantized conductance plateaus.@xcite the fermi wavelength of several 10 nm for the two - dimensional electron gases ( see ref .   for instance ) is much larger than the atomic dimensions . for metals ,",
    "in contrast , the fermi wavelength is on the order of the interatomic distance.@xcite therefore , disorder - related effects due to the atomic structure are expected to play a more important role than for the two - dimensional electron gas devices , and material - specific chemical properties enter as an additional aspect . to describe the metallic atomic contacts , it is hence necessary to take into account both the atomic and the detailed electronic structure.@xcite    recent theoretical studies of the thermopower of nanocontacts have considered separately the effects of disorder and material - specific parameters .",
    "thus , thermoelectric effects for structures with atomically - thin one - dimensional wires connected to two - dimensional electrodes were studied in refs .   for various geometries and with disorder , but without material - specific parameters .",
    "in contrast in refs .",
    "material - specific parameters were employed , while crucial disorder - related effects , resulting in the statistical nature of the experiments,@xcite were neglected by treating only ideal wire geometries .    based on molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of many junction stretching processes",

    "we observe that also here the thermopower fluctuates around zero , but with absolute values roughly one order of magnitude larger as compared to ag and au .",
    "the occurrence of these strong fluctuations , seen also in the conductance , is due to the important contribution of @xmath25 states at @xmath31 .",
    "they give rise to a pronounced energy dependence of the transmission especially for the narrow contacts , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "also , due to the higher anisotropy of these states as compared to the spherically symmetric @xmath0 valence orbitals of ag and au the junction transport properties exhibit a high sensitivity to changes in the atomic positions.@xcite while we are not aware of any measurements of the thermopower for atomic pt contacts , we observe that the conductance for the single - atom and dimer contacts is at around @xmath32 ( see the electrode displacements above @xmath33 nm ) . the multivalent electronic structure and hence the contribution of several channels to the transmission at @xmath31 typically lead to conductance values above @xmath27 for one - atom - wide constrictions , in agreement with the interpretation of measured opening traces and conductance histograms.@xcite      collecting the data of many stretching processes , we perform a statistical analysis similar to the experiments.@xcite for this purpose , we use the 50 simulated opening events of the nanowires for each metal .",
    "typically the contacts break via the single atom ( ag : 12% ; au : 8% ; pt : 4% ) or dimer ( ag : 82% ; au : 68% ; pt : 60% ) configurations mentioned before , with a single atom or a chain of two atoms in the narrowest part , respectively . as visible from the percentage of occurrence",

    "such structures are rare . out of the 50 stretching events , we find at rupture only three chain configurations with chain lengths varying from three to five atoms .",
    "while such structures are generally believed to be unlikely,@xcite they have been observed in transmission electron microscopy studies.@xcite for au and pt atomic chains occur more frequently in our simulations , and they are longer .",
    "we have decided to exclude the junctions breaking with chains of 10 atoms or more in length from our analysis , since experiments indicate maximum lengths of up to eight atoms.@xcite for au we have additionally excluded an opening process leading to a chain with six atoms , because the thermopower exhibits peculiar features before contact rupture related to @xmath25 states .",
    "for this reason we present below the statistical analysis of the transport properties with 50 stretching events for ag , 46 for au , and 41 for pt .",
    "the thermopower - conductance ( @xmath4-@xmath3 ) plots are presented in fig .",

    "negative sign is expected.@xcite we can not exclude such an origin for the trend , but our results with thermopower values of both positive and negative sign demonstrate that it is necessary to go beyond these simple free - electron - gas models with idealized wire geometries to describe even the @xmath0-valent metallic atomic contacts .",
    "furthermore , within the standard deviation the results for @xmath36 are consistent with a vanishing thermopower . from fig .",
    "[ fig : agaupt - sghistos](a - c ) we also observe that the variations of @xmath4 tend to increase for a decreasing minimum cross - section of the contacts .",
    "consistent with the sample opening traces discussed above , the variations of the thermopower around zero are predicted to be one order of magnitude larger for pt than for ag and au .    with respect to @xmath37 and increasing @xmath38 for decreasing @xmath3 ,",

    "possible reasons for the deviations , such as the limited ensemble of considered junction geometries or the approximations inherent to our method , have been discussed in ref .  .",
