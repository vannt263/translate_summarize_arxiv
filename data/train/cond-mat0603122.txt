    "for practical applications of superconducting ( sc ) materials , the increase and , more generally , control of the critical current in sc samples are of great importance . in recent years",
    "much attention was given to the investigation of superconducting films patterned with a regular array of microholes ( antidots ) , which have a profound influence on both the critical current and the critical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "due to the collective pinning to the regular antidot array , vortices are forced to form rigid lattices when their number `` matches '' integer and fractional multiples of the number of pinning sites at fields @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 are integers ) respectively , where @xmath7 is the flux quantum , and @xmath8 is the area of the unit cell of the antidot lattice .",
    "this locking between the pinning array and the vortex lattice is responsible for the reduced mobility of the vortices in applied drive and consequently the increased critical current at integer and fractional matching fields , was confirmed both by experiments ( imaging @xcite , magnetization and transport measurements @xcite ) and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "however , regardless on the imposed pinning profile , the vortices at interstitial sites always have high mobility @xcite , show different dynamic regimes from the pinned ones , and their appearance is followed by a sharp drop in the critical current @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the maximal occupation number of the antidots ( saturation number @xmath9 ) becomes very important for any study of the critical current . in an early theoretical work , mkrtchyan and schmidt @xcite",
    "have shown that @xmath9 depends only on the size of the holes . however , in the case of periodic pinning arrays this number depends also on the proximity of the holes , on temperature and on the applied field @xcite .",
    "besides the pinning strength of the artificial lattice , vortex - vortex interactions are crucial for vortex dynamics .",
    "most of the experiments on perforated superconducting films are carried out in the effective type - ii regime ( @xmath10 , with @xmath2 being the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter , and @xmath11 being the thickness of the sc film scaled to the coherence length @xmath12 ) , where vortices act like charged point - particles , and their interaction with the periodic pinning potential can be described using molecular dynamics simulations ( mds ) @xcite .",
    "however , the overlap of vortex cores ( with sizes @xmath13 ) , and the exact shape of the inter - vortex interaction ( depending on the material properties reflected through @xmath2 ) , which are neglected in mds , may significantly modify the equilibrium vortex structures and consequently the critical current .",
    "in the present letter we investigate the critical current @xmath14 of superconducting films with regular arrays of square antidots , taking into account all parameters relevant to the sc state , within the non - linear ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "this formalism allows us to analyze the @xmath14 dependence on the geometrical parameters of the sample , material ( even type - i ) and temperature , and compare our results with existing experiments .",
    "we consider a thin superconducting film ( of thickness @xmath11 ) with a regular lattice of square holes ( side @xmath15 , period @xmath16 ) immersed in an insulating media with a perpendicular uniform applied field @xmath1 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to describe this system",
    ", we solved the nonlinear ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations for the order parameter @xmath17 and the vector potential @xmath18 ( in dimensionless units , and with temperature @xmath19 taken explicitly in units of the zero field critical temperature @xmath20 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) :    @xmath21    @xmath22    the magnitude of the applied field @xmath1 is determined by the number of flux quanta piercing through the simulation region @xmath23 . on the hole - edges we used boundary conditions corresponding to zero normal component of the superconducting current .",
    "periodic boundary conditions @xcite are used around the square simulation region : @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are lattice vectors and @xmath28 is the gauge potential .",
    "we use the landau gauge @xmath29 for the external vector potential and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , being constants . generally speaking , depending on the geometry of the antidot lattice",
    ", one must minimize the energy with respect to the latter coefficients .",
    "the size of the supercell in our calculation is typically @xmath34 unit cells ( containing 16 holes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 ) .",
    "we solved the system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) self - consistently using the numerical technique of ref . @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the critical current , first we determine the ground vortex - state for a given applied magnetic field after multiple starts from a randomly generated initial cooper - pair distribution .",
    "then the applied current in the @xmath36-direction is simulated by adding a constant @xmath37 to the vector potential of the applied external field @xcite .",
    "note that the current @xmath38 in the sample resulting from the applied @xmath37 is obtained after integration of the @xmath36-component of the induced supercurrents ( calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) over the @xmath39 cross - section of the sample . with increasing @xmath37 ,",
    "the critical current is reached when a stationary solution for eqs .",

    "of the superconducting film at matching fields for different periods of the antidot lattice .",
    "the inset shows the antidot occupation number @xmath40 as a function of @xmath16 at different matching fields . ]",
    "the enforced stability of the vortex lattices in periodically perforated superconducting samples @xcite at integer and fractional matching fields leads to pronounced peaks in the critical current @xcite .",
    "however , the exact shape of these lattices , and consequently their stability when locked to the pinning arrays , strongly depend on the parameters of the sample .",
    "for example , while small antidots can pin only one vortex , in larger holes multi - quanta vortices may become energetically preferable @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of interstitial vortices , whose higher mobility affects strongly the critical current of the sample .",
    "therefore , in this section we investigate the critical current of our sample for different sizes of the antidots @xmath15 and antidot lattice period @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the critical current density @xmath0 of the sample as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath1 for three different values of the antidot size : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the lattice period is @xmath44 , the film thickness @xmath45 and gl parameter equals @xmath46 ( corresponding roughly to pb , nb , or al films ) .",
    "note that , following the suggestion of wahl @xcite , we took into account the influence of the perforation on the effective gl parameter @xmath47 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in the absence of applied field the samples with smaller antidots always have larger @xmath0 simply due to more superconducting material ,",
    "_ i.e. _ larger screening .",
    "however , for @xmath48 , the critical current depends on the vortex structure in the sample . for small antidot - size @xmath41 , where only one vortex can be captured by each hole ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the @xmath3 curve shows the expected maxima at integer matching fields @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and at some of the fractional matching fields . as",
    "observed before @xcite , the peaks of the critical current at matching fields decrease with increasing magnetic field .",
    "however , a novel phenomenon is found for @xmath53 : _ the critical current at the @xmath54 matching field is larger than the one at the @xmath55 matching field_. moreover , the critical currents for @xmath56 are higher than those obtained for fields @xmath57 .",
    "the explanation for this counterintuitive feature of @xmath14 lies in the hole occupation number @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of vortices inside the hole , and , consequently , in the saturation number @xmath9 of the holes ( @xmath58 for larger fields ) . for holes with @xmath59 , @xmath9 is equal to 1 ( @xmath60 @xcite )",
    ". therefore , at @xmath61 , all vortices are captured by the antidots .",
    "analogously , at @xmath62 , besides the pinned vortices , one vortex occupies each interstitial site .",
    "if the same analogy is followed further , one expects two vortices at each pinning site at the @xmath54 matching field .",
    "however , this depends also on the distance between neighboring holes .",
    "namely , the period @xmath16 determines the distance between the interstitial vortices . in other words , for small @xmath16 ,",
    "this distance is small , vortex - vortex repulsion is large , and it may become energetically more favorable for the system to force one more flux - line into the hole rather than have two vortices at interstitial sides ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1](b , c ) ) .",
    "therefore , our results show that the occupation number @xmath40 of the holes in a lattice _ depends not only on the size of the hole @xmath15 , but also on the period @xmath16 and the number of vortices per unit - cell of the hole - lattice_. for the parameters given above , @xmath63 at @xmath64 , _",
    "i.e. _ only one vortex is located at each interstitial site , as for the case of @xmath62 .",
    "note that this interstitial vortex interacts repulsively with the pinned ones .",
    "this interaction is roughly twice as large at @xmath64 than at @xmath62 , and the interstitial vortex becomes effectively `` caged '' .",
    "this `` caging '' effect has been found for @xmath65 for the radius @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , @xmath40 and @xmath68",
    "become independent of @xmath16 and for @xmath69 , the larger suppression of superconductivity around the holes at @xmath70 becomes more significant than `` caging '' , and @xmath14 reverses again in favor of @xmath62 .    with further increase of hole - size @xmath15 ,",
    "more vortices are captured by the holes .",
    "consequently , in order to observe the `` caging '' effect , one needs to consider higher magnetic fields , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath71 , at least @xmath72 is needed . in any case",
    ", this effect can always be realized at a given magnetic field by an adequate choice of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the critical current density of our sample for different periods of the antidot lattice @xmath16 at @xmath42 . for clarity",
    ", we plotted only the critical current at the matching fields . at @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( when there are no interstitial vortices )",
    "the critical current is an increasing function of @xmath16 , because of the stronger screening by larger quantities of the superconducting material . for higher magnetic fields interstitial vortices",
    "nucleate more easily in a sample with larger @xmath16 , which leads to a reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 ( and thus also saturation number @xmath9 ) on @xmath16 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : @xmath40 decreases from @xmath75 to @xmath76 at @xmath77 , when we increase @xmath16 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "for a superconducting film containing an antidot array , at temperatures @xmath80 . the period of the antidot - lattice is @xmath81 m , the antidot size @xmath82 m , film thickness @xmath83 nm , and @xmath2 equals @xmath84 . ]",
    "so far , we presented results of our calculations at fixed temperature , where all units were temperature dependent ( e.g. distances were expressed in @xmath85 ) . in",
    "what follows , we consider a superconducting film with thickness @xmath83 nm , interhole distance @xmath81 m , and antidot size @xmath82 m .",
    "we choose the coherence length @xmath86 nm and the penetration depth @xmath87 nm , which are typical values for pb films .",
    "we study the influence of temperature with the help of the right - side term of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which actually describes the temperature dependence of the coherence length @xmath88 and penetration depth @xmath89 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the calculated critical current density of the sample as a function of the applied field normalized to the first matching field at temperatures @xmath900.86 , 0.88 , 0.9 , 0.92 , 0.94 , 0.96 and 0.98 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the @xmath3 curve shows pronounced maxima at matching fields with a substantial drop after the number of vortices per unit - cell exceeds the hole - saturation number ( in our case , for @xmath91 ) .",
    "as expected , decreasing temperature results in an increase of the critical current for given magnetic field .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior of the @xmath92 characteristics changes .",
    "although the @xmath93 ratio remains the same , the size of vortices and the occupation number of the holes may change with temperature ( as @xmath85 changes ) .",
    "actually , we found the same vortex structure at all temperatures @xmath94 , but @xmath95 is found to be larger than @xmath96 only in the temperatures range @xmath97 . at higher temperatures vortices become larger and suppression of superconductivity around the holes `` masks '' the critical current enhancement by the `` caging '' effect .",
    "this decrease of cooper - pair density around the holes is also responsible for the decreased @xmath98 ratio with increasing temperature . at temperatures lower than @xmath99",
    ", the peaks of @xmath14 again decrease with magnetic field , since @xmath100 significantly increases and its influence on @xmath101 diminishes ( see previous section ) .",
    "interestingly enough , this @xmath102 vs. @xmath103 reversing behavior _ was recently found experimentally , but not noticed_. in fig .  6 of ref .",
    "@xcite a clear enhancement of the critical current at @xmath104 was found which is larger than the one at @xmath105 as is similar to the behavior found in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath106 .",
    "a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment is difficult because of the different determination of @xmath0 . in our calculations",
    "we assume normal state as soon as vortices are set in motion , whereas in transport measurements a certain value of threshold voltage determines the critical current .",
    "as a function of the applied magnetic field for different thickness of the sample .",
    "remaining parameters are listed in the figure . ]    in the previous sections we have shown that higher mobility of interstitial vortices leads to a dramatic decrease of the critical current .",
    "therefore , keeping the interstitial sites of the superconductor vortex - free is essential for an improvement of @xmath14 . in this respect , we consider effectively type - i superconductors , where ( i ) the screening of the magnetic field is enhanced ( _ i.e. _ vortices will be compressed in the holes ) , and ( ii ) the interaction of vortices becomes attractive ( depends on @xmath107 ) . as an example we considered a sample , with antidot size @xmath108 m , lattice period @xmath109 m , @xmath110 nm and @xmath111 nm . we fine - tuned the effective vortex - vortex interaction by varying the thickness of the sample , _",
    "i.e. _ changing from type - ii to type - i behavior with increasing @xmath11 . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the critical current of the sample for four values of the film thickness : @xmath112 nm ( solid dots ) , @xmath113 nm ( open dots ) , @xmath114 nm ( solid squares ) and @xmath115 nm ( open squares ) at @xmath116 . for @xmath112 nm ,",
    "the sample is still in the type - ii regime ( @xmath117 ) , and the critical current shows a peak - like behavior at the matching fields . the drop in the critical current for @xmath91",
    "is caused by the interstitial vortices which is larger with increasing @xmath118 .",
    "note that the `` caging '' effect is also present for these values of the parameters . when the film thickness is increased ( @xmath113 nm , @xmath119 ) the critical current density is higher for @xmath120 . for @xmath121 , this increase is achieved due to a stronger meissner effect . at fields @xmath122",
    "the increase of @xmath14 is more apparent , as all vortices are captured by the holes ( except for @xmath112 nm , where @xmath76 ) .",
    "as soon as interstitial vortices appear in the sample ( @xmath123 ) , @xmath0 becomes even smaller than the one for @xmath112 nm .",
    "this inversion of @xmath0 clearly demonstrates the higher mobility of interstitial vortices in type - i superconductors .",
    "looking at the @xmath92 curve as a whole for @xmath113 nm , we observed a pronounced _ step - like behavior_. note that in type - i samples the matching between the number of flux - lines and the number of antidots does not lead to a peak - like increase of the critical current .",
    "namely , regardless of their number , additional flux lines are doubly pinned by the attractive hole - potential and the attractive interaction with previously pinned vortices .",
    "the `` step '' in @xmath92 occurs only when the number of vortices per hole @xmath40 changes ( more vortices and consequently a larger suppression of @xmath17 around the hole ) , or when interstitial vortices appear .",
    "the effect of an increase of @xmath40 diminishes as @xmath11 increases ( _ i.e. _ @xmath118 decreases and screening increases ) , or when temperature is lowered ( as discussed before ) .",
    "this tendency is illustrated by solid and open dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and ultimately leads to a _ two - step @xmath92 curve _ , with larger critical current for @xmath124 , and smaller @xmath14 for @xmath125 , where @xmath126 .",
    "we studied the critical current of a superconducting film containing an array of antidots in a uniform magnetic field , as a function of all relevant parameters .",
    "we found that the well - known @xmath0 enhancement by artificial vortex pinning strongly depends on the antidot occupation number @xmath40 .",
    "the latter is determined not only by the size of the antidots as commonly believed , but _ also by their spacing and the applied field_. as a consequence , when the parameter conditions are met , the critical current becomes larger _ at higher matching fields _ , contrary to the conventional behavior .",
    "such a feature is a result of the `` caging '' of interstitial vortices between the larger number of pinned ones .",
    "this effect is strongly influenced by temperature , which agrees with a recent experiment .",
