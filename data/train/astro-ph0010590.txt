    "at the present time the value adopted for @xmath2 depends directly on the calibration of local distance indicators .",
    "these local calibrators should have a number of rather obvious characteristics .",
    "their absolute magnitudes should be derivable with good accuracy .",
    "the methods used to obtain these absolute magnitudes should be based on sound empirical results and be as free as possible from assumptions based on theory .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the calibrators should ideally be free from a dependence on either the age or the metallicity of the objects involved .",
    "but if there are age and metallicity effects , these must be known empirically and measurable in both the calibrating and programme stars .",
    "+ 3 . the interstellar reddenings and absorptions of both calibrating and programme stars must be measurable with good accuracy .",
    "+ considerable emphasis has been put on point 1 in much of the current literature . however , points 2 and 3 are of equal importance , especially if one is hoping to establish scales to 5 or 10 percent .",
    "in fact , problems relating to these two latter points seem to account for some of the conflicting scales that have been recently proposed . +",
    "in the following it will be assumed that the primary interest at this symposium is the calibration of the scale to be used in the study of cepheids ; particularly the scale to adopt with the hst work on extragalactic cepheids .",
    "the way in which the hst data are analysed differs slightly from one group of workers to another . however , the analysis is basically equivalent to using a period - luminosity relation at ( johnson ) @xmath0 , pl(@xmath0 ) , with a measured @xmath0 to obtain an apparent distance modulus .",
    "the reddening , and hence the absorption , @xmath3 , is derived from the @xmath4 colour together with a period-@xmath5 relation , pc(@xmath6 ) .",
    "+ a galactic pc(@xmath6 ) relation can be obtained from local cepheids with individual reddenings derived from three colour @xmath7 photometry , e.g. @xmath8 this is derived from caldwell & coulson ( 1987 ) ( see feast 1999 , appendix d , where a somewhat more accurate procedure is given ) .",
    "the zero - point of the @xmath7 reddening system is set by the reddenings of cepheids in open clusters whose reddenings are derived from non - cepheid cluster members . however , it is important to note that in the most secure estimates of the cepheid zero - point , the reddening zero - point is immaterial so long as one is consistently using the same zero - point for both calibrating and programme cepheids .",
    "this is a major advantage of cepheids over other distance indicators where this differential method can not , or as yet has not been , applied . + the cepheid pl(@xmath0 ) relation can be written : @xmath9 the slope of the relation is taken from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( caldwell & laney 1991 ) .",
    "this is the only use made of lmc data in deriving a cepheid calibration .",
    "the slope may be estimated in a number of ways , none of which give significantly different values ( see feast 1999 for a discussion of this point and for a more detailed discussion of many of the points mentioned in the present paper ) .",
    "values of @xmath10 can be obtained in a number of ways .",
    "the most direct , empirical method is to use parallaxes of galactic cepheids .",
    "a bias free analysis of cepheid parallaxes from the hipparcos catalogue ( esa 1997 ) gives , + @xmath11 + ( feast & catchpole 1997 , feast 1999 ) . this result and its bias free nature has been confirmed either directly or through monte carlo simulations by several groups ( pont 1999 , lanoix et al .",
    "1999 , groenewegen & oudmaijer 2000 ) .",
    "proper motions from hipparcos can be combined with radial velocities in a statistical parallax type solution for @xmath10 .",
    "this requires a galactic model .",
    "both the proper motions ( feast & whitelock 1997 ) and the radial velocities ( e.g. pont et al . 1994 ) show clearly and independently the dominant effect of differential galactic rotation on cepheid motions and this is then the required model . in this way feast ,",
    "pont & whitelock ( 1998 ) obtained , + @xmath12 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath10 can be obtained from pulsation parallaxes ( the baade - wesselink method ) . in most current forms of this method a radius derived from radial velocities and photometry",
    "is combined with a colour - surface brightness relation to give an absolute magnitude .",
    "laney ( 1998 ) recently obtained results which imply : + @xmath13 + ( see feast 1999 ) .",
    "if this method is applied consistently the internal errors can be very small .",
    "however , it is not yet possible to estimate realistically possible systematic errors in the derived radii or in the surface brightness estimates .",
    "progress should be possible in this area when accurate interferometric observations of cepheid radii ( and their variation with phase ) are obtained .",
    "though even then systematic effects in the interpretation of the results may be difficult to estimate .",
    "unlike the first two methods discussed above , the reddening zero - point is of importance when absolute magnitudes are derived in this way .",
    "cepheid luminosities can be calibrated somewhat less directly using those cepheids that are members of open clusters .",
    "however , the direct determination of distances to some open clusters by hipparcos has raised a number of problems ( e.g. the large change in the distance of the pleiades from the value inferred pre - hipparcos ) .",
    "there are indications ( see , e.g. feast 1999 , van leeuwen 2000 , robichon et al .",
    "2000 ) that these problems arise though a combination of photometric errors , errors in adopted reddenings and errors in assumed metallicity , all of which can have a significant effect because of the steepness of the main sequence .",
    "there is also a suggestion that the shape of the upper main sequence as a function of age may not agree entirely with theoretical predictions ( van leeuwen 2000 ) .",
    "evidently these questions will need to be sorted out , both for the nearby clusters with hipparcos parallaxes and the clusters containing cepheids before this method of obtaining cepheid luminosities can be fully trusted .",
    "it seems best at the present time to base a cluster distance scale on the hyades for which there is an excellent hipparcos parallax ( yielding @xmath14 , perryman et al .",
    "1998 ) and a metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = + 0.13 ) which seems well accepted ( e.g. pinsonneault et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the metallicity corrections of these latter authors then show that the hyades main sequence in @xmath15 corresponds to that expected for a solar metallicity cluster at @xmath16 , or 3.12 if the metallicity corrections of robichon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are used .",
    "a mean of 3.14 is adopted . since most work on cepheids in clusters is referred to turner s ( 1979 ) pleiades main - sequence we need to see how this is affected by this hyades result . the pleiades - hyades magnitude difference in a @xmath15 diagram , corrected for reddening but",
    "not metallicity , is 2.52 mag .",
    "( pel 1985 ) .",
    "thus the turner sequence is that expected for a solar metallicity cluster at @xmath17 .",
    "if we assume that the clusters and associations containing cepheids which are listed in table 1 of feast ( 1999 ) are in the mean of solar metallicity , then the results given there lead to : + @xmath18 + the external error of this result will be higher , partly due to the uncertainties in the metallicity correction .",
    "note that , as with the baade - wesselink determinations , this result depends on the zero - point of the reddening scale adopted , unlike the first two results discussed in this section .",
    "+ a straight mean of these four zero - point determinations gives : + @xmath19 .",
    "+ this value is adopted here , although it should be noted that the two determinations which are most securely grounded ( 1 and 2 above ) give a slightly brighter zero - point ( 1.45 ) the real uncertainty in the adopted value is likely to be somewhat less than 0.1 .",
    "the implied distance scale is about 7 percent greater than that used by the hst cepheid workers . but this estimate may require revision when the details of the revised scale reported briefly by freedman at this meeting , are available .",
    "possible metallicity effects in deriving cepheid distances from @xmath20 data were considered in some detail in feast ( 1999 ) .",
    "there are three possible causes of such effects .",
    "+ 1 . a change of temperature at a given period .",
    "a change of atmospheric blanketing at a given temperature .",
    "+ 3 . a change in bolometric luminosity at a given period .",
    "+ items 1 and 2 affect the bolometric corrections at the wavelengths in question .",
    "laney ( 1998 , 1999 and private communication ) discussed baade - wesselink radii and colours of cepheids in the galaxy ( @xmath21 \\sim 0 $ ] ) , the lmc ( @xmath21 \\sim -0.3 $ ] ) , and the smc ( @xmath21 \\sim -0.6 $ ] ) , which lead ( feast 1999 ) to an effect in the derived distance moduli ( in the @xmath22 system ) of @xmath23^{-1}$ ] .",
    "kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found the effect to be , @xmath24^{-1}$ ] from a study of cepheids in regions of different metallicity in m101 .",
    "both these estimates are in the sense that without the correction the distance of a metal - poor cepheid would be overestimated . + further tests can be made by comparing the cepheid distance modulus of the lmc , where the cepheids have @xmath21 \\sim -0.3 $ ] ( luck et al .",
    "1998 ) , with independent estimates of the lmc modulus . in carrying out such a test one must bear in mind that none of the non - cepheid distance indicators are free from problems of one kind or another .",
    "in addition the relative reddenings of these indicators and the cepheids is a source of added uncertainty .",
    ".non - cepheid lmc moduli [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     table 2 contains mean lmc moduli as derived from each of the indicators in table 1 .",
    "where several estimates for a given indicator are listed in table 1 , a straight unweighted mean has been taken except that the trigonometrical parallax result for rr lyraes has been given half weight because of its large standard error .",
    "( note that the statistical parallax result for the rr lyrae stars has been given full weight although reasons were given in section 3.1 for regarding it with some suspicion . )",
    "+ the first three entries of table 2 are probably the most reliable and their mean is 18.58 .",
    "a mean of all six entries is 18.54 which is negligibly different .",
    "these values may be compared with the cepheid values which are also given in table 2 .",
    "these depend on the the use of @xmath22 photometry and the pl zero - point derived in section 2 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "no metallicity correction has been applied to the first entry whilst the others have been correction according to the results of laney or of kennicutt et al . as discussed in section 3 .",
    "these results suggest that the lmc test provides some additional evidence that the use of the cepheid @xmath22 method is slightly metallicity dependent in the same sense as shown by the results of laney and of kennicutt et al .",
    "however , in view of the various uncertainties an effect in the lmc of about 0.1 mag must be considered marginal .",
    "galactic calibration of the cepheid pl(@xmath0 ) and pc(@xmath6 ) relations indicate that the scale used by hst workers ( at least prior to mid-2000 ) needs increasing by about seven percent .",
    "various tests suggests that there is a small metallicity effect when using @xmath0 and @xmath1 data in the manner adopted by the hst workers .",
    "the size of this effect is still rather uncertain .",
    "it is possibly @xmath26 or @xmath27^{-1}$ ] in the sense that the corrected distances of metal - poor cepheids are smaller than the uncorrected ones .",
