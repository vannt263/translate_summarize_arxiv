    "due to important technical progress , the field of molecular electronics , born in the mid 70s with the proposal of aviram and ratner to use single organic molecules as rectifiers @xcite , receives rapidly growing interest @xcite .",
    "indeed , new fabrication methods and probes now enable individual molecules or small numbers of them to be connected to macroscopic electrodes @xcite . among these methods ,",
    "one may cite , for instance , the break - junction technique @xcite and the use of a conducting atomic - force - microscope ( afm ) to contact molecules absorbed on a metallic surface @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the problem posed by these experimental works is highly challenging .",
    "we are facing a non - equilibrium many - body problem where , moreover , the coupling to a phonon bath may also be of importance . up to now",
    ", most of the studies have focussed on the coherent regime and the landauer approach has been employed to obtain the conductance from _ ab initio _ or semi - empirical models @xcite .",
    "important inelastic processes were included only within simple models @xcite and much further progress is needed before one may hope to reach a satisfactory understanding of the problem .    the exact number of molecules contacted by the leads remains for a large part uncontrolled in the experimental set - ups cited above @xcite . in theoretical modelling it is convenient to assume that a single organic molecule bridges two semi - infinite metallic electrodes ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "another important experimental aspect is the fact that current - voltage characteristics are measured with applied voltages up to a few volts , values which bring us well away from the linear regime .    in this context",
    ", a central question concerns the electrostatic potential profile of a biased molecular wire .",
    "the importance of this issue was first demonstrated by datta and coworkers @xcite . using semi - empirical models",
    ", they have shown that different choices of the electrostatic profile have a profound effect on the current - voltage characteristics of a molecular junction .",
    "for instance , the transport properties are strongly modified depending on whether the potential drop occurs at the interface between molecule and electrode or along the molecular wire .",
    "in fact , it is natural to assume that even the details of the potential shape have a considerable effect on molecular conductance .",
    "recently , a few works along that line have been reported @xcite .",
    "they give us a rather ambiguous view of this fundamental problem .",
    "model calculations involving self - consistent solutions of the coupled poisson and schrdinger equations suggest that the potential drop occurs mainly at the interface between the molecule and the electrodes @xcite . within the molecule , the electrostatic potential",
    "is then found to be essentially flat .",
    "screening appears to be very efficient within this approach and the final conclusions are in agreement with some previous investigations @xcite .",
    "however , these model calculations involve a drastic approximation : instead of solving the full poisson equation , the authors of ref .",
    "have used a one - dimensional version of it .",
    "implicitly , it is then assumed that the lateral dimensions of the molecule are much larger than the screening length . for quasi - one dimensional systems with lateral dimensions of the order of a few angstrms , such as the organic molecules used in recent experimental work , this approximation is clearly questionable @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ calculations on carbon and gold chains show a quite different picture @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the potential drop occurs not only at the interface but rather along the entire molecule .",
    "moreover , the local potential is found to display pronounced friedel oscillations .",
    "contrary to previous results , screening appears to be rather inefficient , even for metallic wires .",
    "we are then left with two different pictures and it becomes clear that a full understanding of the electrostatic potential profile in biased molecular wires or metallic constrictions is still lacking . in this work , we re - address the problem following the approach by mujica _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite we perform model calculations and solve the coupled set of two equations : the poisson equation for the electrostatics and the schrdinger equation for the electronic structure . in this respect ,",
    "our work is similar to that of mujica _ et al . _",
    "@xcite however , the calculation is modified in ways that we believe to be essential .",
    "in particular , we treat the real three - dimensional poisson equation .",
    "as recently discussed by us @xcite , we expect that this proper handling of the electrostatic problem changes the qualitative behavior : the potential is poorly screened and falls off substantially along the molecule .",
    "indeed , the electrostatic potential profile of the model calculations presented here is in semi - quantitative agreement with the _ ab initio _ results reported in refs .   and  .",
    "however , while _ ab initio _ calculations are involved and intricate enough to leave the underlying physics essentially obscure , our model includes only the ingredients necessary to capture the correct screening effects , and consequently our calculations are rather economic in time .",
    "we thus believe that our approach may help to gain further insight into the difficult problem of understanding transport through molecules , i.e.  at a scale where quantum effects are prominent . a forthcoming work by ghosh _ et al .",
    "@xcite reaches conclusions similar to those presented here .    in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , our model hamiltonian is introduced . the electronic density in the absence of a bias potential",
    "is then studied in section  [ sec : nobias ] , using exact diagonalization and hartree - fock calculations that are shown to agree reasonably well which each other .",
    "the electrostatic profile is then calculated in section  [ sec : bias ] at the hartree - fock level .",
    "finally , the current - voltage characteristics are discussed in section  [ sec : iv ] .",
    "the physical problem posed by a molecular wire between two infinite metallic reservoirs is far too complicated to be solved exactly and , to proceed , several approximations are necessary .",
    "first , we assume that the surfaces of the two electrodes are infinite planes ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "second , the molecule is assumed to be weakly connected to the metallic electrodes so that their chemical constitution is unimportant .",
    "this is certainly not fulfilled for some of the wires examined experimentally , with covalent bonds between molecule and electrode .",
    "finally , we assume the characteristic time scale for electronic processes in the electrodes to be much shorter than the transit time of electrons in the wire .",
    "the electrodes can then be treated as equipotential surfaces , and the schrdinger equation is solved under these potential boundary conditions .",
    "we are then within the same framework used in ref .  , but proceed differently .",
    "we first determine the coulomb interaction potential which includes the image charges due to the metallic leads , keeping its three - dimensional character .",
    "then , we solve the electronic wire problem .     and",
    "@xmath0 , are assumed to be weak .",
    "the chemical potentials in the left and right electrode are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . ]",
    "the coulomb interaction energy reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the charge density in the wire and @xmath5 is the potential at point @xmath6 produced by the charge located at point @xmath7 .",
    "the coulomb potential is the solution of the poisson equation @xmath8 where for convenience we have introduced a factor @xmath9 measuring the strength of the electron - electron interaction . in the absence of the metallic electrodes the solution of ( [ eq : poisson ] ) is given by the standard coulomb potential @xmath10    in the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we require the potential in the absence of an external bias to vanish on the surfaces of the metallic electrodes , i.e.  at @xmath11 and @xmath12 . a solution of the poisson equation with these particular boundary conditions is found using the standard method of image charges @xmath13 \\label{coulomb}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the distance between the two electrodes ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and @xmath15 the unit vector along the molecular axis .",
    "@xmath16 is a genuine three - dimensional coulomb potential including the effects of the two semi - infinite metallic electrodes .",
    "the electrostatics of the molecular junction is then governed by this potential .",
    "it remains to construct and solve the schrdinger equation for the molecular wire .      in the following ,",
    "we will mainly be concerned with conjugated molecules and , in particular , with their low - energy properties .",
    "an appropriate description can then be given by an effective tight - binding hamiltonian for the @xmath17 electrons only @xcite .",
    "in addition , since there exist _ ab initio _ results for short chains of gold atoms @xcite , it is also of interest to study systems with electrons in s - orbitals .",
    "we therefore attach gaussian type orbitals of the form @xmath18\\big]\\ ] ] to each atomic site @xmath19 .",
    "this allows us to model both s - orbitals with @xmath20 and p - orbitals with @xmath21 .",
    "the center of the orbital , @xmath22 , depends on the distance @xmath23 between each electrode and the molecule as well as the lattice constant @xmath24 in the molecule ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 determines the spread of the state and gives an estimate of the electronic density .",
    "finally , the normalization constants for s- and p - orbitals are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the explicit form ( [ gaussian ] ) of the orbitals allows us to determine the effective parameters entering the tight - binding model . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the ` zero differential overlap ' ( zdo ) approximation @xcite @xmath28which remains valid as long as the orbitals @xmath29 are strongly localized on the atomic sites @xmath19 .",
    "it implies orthogonality between the gaussian orbitals on different sites and , most importantly , leads to a drastic reduction of non - vanishing matrix elements of the coulomb operator since only the two center integrals are retained in the final model .",
    "in particular , no exchange integrals will appear .",
    "these integrals , involving a differential overlap , are usually negligibly small compared to the coulomb integrals .",
    "moreover , we approximate the positive cores by point charges localized at the atomic sites @xmath30 with coordinates @xmath31 . then , the energy of an electron localized at site @xmath19 due to all positive core charges and their images becomes @xmath32 within the zdo approximation the only finite coulomb matrix elements are related to the interaction energy between electrons localized at sites @xmath19 and @xmath33 @xmath34 it is worthwhile to notice that the interaction terms ( [ onsite ] ) and ( [ coulombterm ] ) depend on the position @xmath19 along the chain due to the image charges but also because of the finite size of the molecular wire",
    ".    within the zdo approximation kinetic energy contributions vanish as a consequence of ( [ zdo ] ) .",
    "to lowest order , the overlap leads to a constant shift of the on - site energy @xmath35 that may be disregarded and to nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the hopping matrix element @xmath36 can not be evaluated directly within the zdo and , therefore , has to be treated as a parameter of the model @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to relax the approximation @xcite and estimate the hopping matrix elements from ( [ gaussian ] ) .",
    "doing so , we have found that their dependences on @xmath19 are not pronounced , and , moreover , this kind of more sophisticated treatment would not change qualitatively our final conclusions .",
    "therefore , we assume the hopping matrix elements , @xmath36 , to be constant along the chain , and use the ratio @xmath37 as a parameter to examine the importance of electron - electron interaction .",
    "with the parameters just discussed , we obtain a description of the electrons in terms of an effective tight - binding model which includes long range coulomb interaction @xcite @xmath38 @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the usual creation ( annihilation ) operators for an electron with spin @xmath41 in the local state @xmath29 . in the first term",
    ", we have accounted for an additional shift of the local potential due to an external bias . with the chemical potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the left and right electrode , respectively , the shift at site @xmath19 is given by @xmath42    the resulting tight - binding model ( [ tb ] ) is mostly defined by the geometry of the molecular junction .",
    "the only other parameters are the energies @xmath36 and @xmath9 , which determine the strength of the kinetic and coulomb energies , respectively .",
    "it is usually believed that conjugated molecules lie in an intermediate regime where @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "consider first the situation without bias potential , @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "we analyse for this case the electron density at equilibrium in the absence of electron transfer between the molecule and the leads . in all the calculations presented here ,",
    "we assume the chains to be electrically neutral with on average one electron per site .",
    "because of the electron spin , this corresponds to the half - filled case . furthermore ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the ground state of the system .",
    "we have done exact diagonalization studies for chains of up to 12 sites .",
    "results for the charge density of a chain with 12 sites shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are typical for other cases studied .",
    "two main features can easily be seen .",
    "( i ) the electron density is non - uniform : the electrons have a tendency to shift towards the middle of the chain .",
    "( ii ) because of this non - uniformity , substantial friedel oscillations occur across the wire .",
    "these features can be explained by invoking electron - hole symmetry as it is shown below .    ) with @xmath46 sites .",
    "the parameters are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the full curve is the exact result for a molecule - electrode distance of @xmath49 .",
    "the dotted curve is for the same geometry but at hartree - fock level .",
    "the dashed curve is the exact result for the case without metallic electrodes , @xmath50 . ]    for the case of a half - filled band it has long been known that the electron density is uniform , i.e.  does not depend on the site index @xmath19 , for models defined on bipartite lattices in such a way that electron - hole symmetry is fulfilled .",
    "this theorem was first discovered for the ground state of the free - electron ( hckel ) model @xcite and later extended to some interacting systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , a generalization to canonical and grand canonical ensembles was proven for a large class of models @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the theorem applies to models invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath51 .    applying this transformation , we find that the hamiltonian of the molecular wire ( [ tb ] ) is invariant only if the equality @xmath52 is fulfilled where @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "this implies that the electron - ion interaction is essentially compensated , up to a constant term , by the repulsive electron - electron interaction .",
    "notice that allowing for hopping matrix elements that depend on the position in the chain would not change this equality .",
    "indeed , a term like @xmath54 remains unchanged when the electron - hole transformation is applied . from this point of view , it is not necessary to go beyond the zdo approximation .",
    "the equality ( [ uniformity ] ) can be satisfied only in very particular cases where at least one of the following conditions is satisfied :    * the chain is infinite ; * there is no interaction , @xmath55 ; * @xmath56 , corresponding to interactions between point charges .",
    "none of these criteria are fulfilled in realistic cases of interest . with the exception of carbon nanotubes ,",
    "experimental molecular junctions involve relatively short ( @xmath57 ) molecular chains @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction is of the same order of magnitude as the kinetic terms @xcite and certainly not negligible .",
    "even then , the electron density would still be uniform if the electron - orbitals are reduced to points ( @xmath56 ) irrespective of the presence of image charges .",
    "therefore , one may say that the non - uniformity of the density comes from the lateral extension of the electronic clouds , the p- or s - states",
    ". this shows , once again , the need of a three - dimensional treatment of the electronic structure .    the exact shape of the electron density is determined by ( i ) the strength of the coulomb interaction , @xmath37 , ( ii ) the spread of the electronic orbitals , @xmath25 , and ( iii ) the geometry of the system , expressed in our model by the length @xmath58 of the molecule and by the distance @xmath23 between the electrodes and the molecule .",
    "all these factors contribute to yield , instead of the uniform density condition ( [ uniformity ] ) , the relation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a function of the position in the chain ; its dependence on @xmath19 is responsible for the non - homogeneity of the electronic density .",
    "it is of interest to understand the effects of each of these parameters separately .",
    "_ coulomb interaction_. starting from the non - interacting case where the electronic density is uniform , increasing @xmath9 results in an increase of the friedel oscillations until the electrons start to localize . in the limit @xmath61",
    ", half filling leads to a mott insulator and one recovers a constant electron density .    _",
    "spread of the electronic orbitals_. when the orbitals are reduced to points ( point charge limit ) , @xmath56 , the electronic density is uniform .",
    "indeed , in this particular limit the electron - ion and electron - electron interactions have the same form restoring the electron - hole symmetry of the molecular hamiltonian .",
    "accounting for a spread of the orbitals increases slowly the amplitude of the friedel oscillations .",
    "_ geometry of the molecular junction_. two effects need to be distinguished : ( i ) the finite size effects and ( ii ) the image - charge effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the dashed curve shows the density for the very same system used to obtain the other two curves except that now no metallic electrodes are present .",
    "therefore , the dashed curve contains only the finite size effects . from this particular example",
    ", one sees that both effects contribute to the friedel oscillations and that , in order to get the correct density , image interactions should be included unless the electrode - molecule distances is large .",
    "in fact , in the example of fig .  [ fig2 ] , the contribution to the oscillations due to the image charges is the larger one .",
    "the coulomb interaction with the electrodes described by the image charges is therefore crucial to estimate transport properties of molecular wires or metallic constrictions .",
    "we have observed , as expected , that finite size effects alone tend to disappear when the chain size is increased . in contrast",
    ", the effect of image charges tends to become more important : the amplitude of the friedel oscillations increases with the system size due to the presence of the two metallic electrodes .",
    "this tendency should continue until for long wires , that we do not consider here , the oscillations occur predominantly near the edges .    finally , the dotted curve of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the electron density with metallic electrodes calculated within the hartree - fock approximation ; it is in very good agreement with the exact result .",
    "we have performed calculations for different values of @xmath9 up to @xmath62 and observed that , as far as the electron density is concerned , the hartree - fock approximation gives reasonable results .",
    "this allow us to use this mean - field approach for the study of the electrostatic profile in biased molecular wires ( section  [ sec : bias ] ) and their transport properties ( section  [ sec : iv ] ) .",
    "the application of the screened on - site electrostatic potential to calculations of conductance properties is useful only within a single electron theory , e.g. in the mean - field description of the process .",
    "this is how this concept was applied in the calculation of mujica _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and in the density functional theory @xcite . here",
    ", our calculations are done using the hartree - fock approximation applied to the molecular hamiltonian ( [ tb ] ) . in the previous section , by comparing the mean - field electron density with the exact one , we have already shown , that the approximate result is reasonable in the range of parameters proper to conjugated molecules .",
    "more precisely , the hartree - fock density is in very good agreement with the exact results for values of @xmath9 up to , approximately , @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and remains of reasonable accuracy up to values of about @xmath64 . in the following we present",
    "only results for @xmath48 , but the same qualitative picture arises also for larger values of @xmath9 .    starting from the initial tight - binding model ( [ tb ] ) , we build an effective hamiltonian by solving self - consistently the usual hartree - fock equations @xcite leading to @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the chemical potentials will always be chosen such that @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is the effective on - site potential which includes the ionic attraction and the electron - electron repulsion incorporated within a mean field picture as well as the on - site potential ( [ rampe ] ) .",
    "@xmath69 is the effective hopping matrix element which includes the exchange terms .",
    "note that a vanishing of exchange integrals in the zdo approximation is not equivalent to an hartree approximation .",
    "indeed , a mean field approximation of ( [ tb ] ) still contains exchange terms of the form @xmath70 which , due to the long range part of the coulomb potential ( [ coulomb ] ) , include long range hopping .    without coulomb interactions ,",
    "the electrostatic potential is given by the ramp defined in ( [ rampe ] ) , i.e.  by the potential in the absence of a molecule .",
    "this linear profile has been used sometimes in the literature to study non - linear current - voltage characteristics @xcite .    in the presence of coulomb interaction ,",
    "the linear profile is changed and the screened electrostatic potential , @xmath71 , is given by the difference between the on - site term with and without bias voltage .",
    "@xmath72    a typical example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for a chain with 20 sites .",
    "we see two main features : ( i ) screening is not very efficient and , consequently , there is only a small potential drop at the interfaces but a finite slope of the potential along the entire molecule ; ( ii ) there are substantial friedel oscillations along the profile .     in eq .

    "it shows a small decrease in slope along the entire molecule with substantial friedel oscillations . ]",
    "our results differ from those of mujica _ et al . _",
    "@xcite despite the fact that the two models are closely related .",
    "these differences mostly come from the fact that we solve the poisson equation without resorting to a one - dimensional approximation .",
    "as recently shown by us within a classical model @xcite , a three - dimensional treatment of the electrostatics is necessary , and in fact leads to the identification of the lateral thickness of the molecule as a new generic attribute that determines the potential profile . in fig .",

    "indeed , an increase of the bias potential corresponds to an increase of the window of integration in formula ( [ current0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a jump in the @xmath87-@xmath88 curves means that one more discrete molecular level enters this window of integration .",
    "it is interesting to note that fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows also wide regions of negative differential resistance , in particular in the non - interacting case . within our simple formulation",
    ", they can be explained by the localization of charges induced by a strong enough electric field : at sufficiently high bias voltage , charge carriers are localized at one end of the chain resulting in a decrease of the current .",
    "this could be an artifact of our weak molecule - electrode coupling model , however negative differential resistance has been found in recent experiments @xcite , and electric field induced localization could be a way to understand these experimental findings .",

    "we have addressed the problem of calculating transport properties of a molecular wire bridging two semi - infinite metallic electrodes .",
    "a first important part of this task is to determine the electrostatic potential profile through the biased wire @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is of importance to know how screening effects modify the ramp potential ( eq .  [ rampe ] ) existing in the absence of the organic molecule .",
    "this work and our earlier paper @xcite resolve discrepancies between answers available in the literature .",
    "on the one hand , a tight - binding model combined with a one - dimensional poisson equation gives a strong screening version of the problem : the drop of the potential occurs at the interfaces and the potential is therefore almost flat within the molecule @xcite . on the other hand , recent _ ab initio _",
    "results give a weak screening version : no substantial drop at the interfaces but rather a decrease along the entire molecule together with substantial friedel oscillations @xcite .    in this paper , we have proposed a modified tight - binding model to address this question .",

    "( i ) we introduce a three - dimensional coulomb potential ( eq .  [ coulomb ] ) which includes the image interaction with the two metallic electrodes assumed to have planar surfaces .",
    "( ii ) the electrons localized at atomic sites are modelled by gaussian type orbitals of finite lateral extent ( eq .  [ gaussian ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the positive background is assumed to be a set of point charges localized on the atomic sites . with these three ingredients",

    "[ fig5 ] ) as is common in the weak tunnelling limit @xcite . zones of negative differential resistance are found due to charge localization induced by the electric field .",
    "the main effects of the coulomb interaction , within our approximations , are , on the one hand , a shift to higher energies of the position of the current - voltage steps and , on the other hand , a partial compensation of the localization of the electrons diminishing the negative differential resistance effects in agreement with a previous study @xcite .    in closing , it is important to stress some limitations of our model .",
    "on the one hand , we consider coherent transport , assuming that the electrons are transferred from one lead to the other in a single quantum mechanical process .",
    "this is a good approximation if the tunnelling time is much less than the inelastic scattering time . for organic molecules ,",
    "this transit time could be of the same order of magnitude as the intramolecular vibronic relaxation time , especially in the weak contact limit employed here @xcite . in this case",
    ", part of the current could be due to sequential tunnelling , where the molecular wire would be successively charged and discharged .",
    "this important issue remains to be studied further .",
    "we have neglected charging effects assuming the molecule to remain neutral . at high voltage",
    ", this approximation could fail @xcite .",
    "the average charge number of the molecule could increase in analogy with coulomb blockade phenomena observed in mesoscopic metallic double tunnel junctions and quantum dots @xcite , and , more recently , in multiwall carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "a proper handling of the full problem requires to treat the wire as an open system dynamically coupled to the electrodes and to the vibronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this program is far beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the authors have benefitted from useful discussions with p.  hnggi , s.  kohler , j.  lehmann , and s.  yaliraki .",
