    "the numbers @xmath8 , which we shall refer to as the @xmath9-th @xmath10-*graded betti numbers * of degree @xmath7 of @xmath11 , are independent of the choice of graded minimal finite free resolution .",
    "questions about betti numbers - including when they vanish and when they do not , what bounds they have , how they relate to the base field @xmath2 and what are the most effective ways to compute them - are of particular interest in combinatorial commutative algebra . via a method called polarization  @xcite",

    "simplicial trees  @xcite and related structures were developed as a class of simplicial complexes that generalize graph - trees , so that their facet ideals have similar properties to those of edge ideals of graphs discovered in a series of works by villarreal and his coauthors  @xcite .",
    "this paper offers an order on the monomials generating the facet ideal of a simplicial tree which uses the existence of a `` good leaf '' in every simplicial tree  @xcite .",
    "this order in itself is combinatorially interesting and useful , but it turns out that it also produces a `` splitting ''  @xcite of the facet ideal of a tree which gives bounds on the betti numbers of the ideal .",
    "our good leaf order also makes it possible to refine a recursive formula of h and van tuyl  @xcite for computing betti numbers of facet ideals of simplicial trees , and to apply it to classes of trees with strict good leaf orders .",
    "the idea here is that a good leaf order will split an ideal to some extent , and within each one of these split pieces , one can apply h and van tuyl s formula quite efficiently if the order is strict .",
