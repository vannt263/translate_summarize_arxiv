    "in 1971 , nariai[1 ] formulated gravitational equations with lagrangian density @xmath1 including the square of ricci tensors , in terms of an extended version of the renormalized theory of gravitation due to utiyama and dewitt.[2 ] he aimed to derive a regular solution without any cosmological singularity , and nariai and tomita[3 ] showed many examples of the regular solutions , solving the equations in the homogeneous and isotropic model .",
    "they found that , as the time increases , most of them do not tend to the friedmann model , but to the de sitter model in the future .",
    "this may be the first time when we found that the square of ricci tensors in the lagrangian causes de sitter expansion without cosmological constant .    in 1980 ,",
    "starobinsky[4 ] formulated independently gravitational equations with @xmath1 including the square of ricci tensors , and derived the well - known solution in which the universe starts with the de sitter expansion , and the expansion rate decreases with time .",
    "this behavior of the universe was taken notice a few years later as one of the models representing the inflation of the universe.[5 - 9 ]    after several years , a new system of simplified gravitational equations with @xmath2  was considered[10 , 11 ] , where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar and @xmath4 is a constant , and next to solve them , a method using conformal transformations was exploited[12 - 15 ] and the behavior of the models was shown more clearly .    in this note ,",
    "i first compare the equations to be solved for deriving the models which were given by nariai and tomita and by starobinsky , and discuss the difference in their solutions .",
    "next i describe their simplified models , and use conformal transformations to find the behaviors of the models and show how the inflation is caused and the singularity is avoided .",

    "found that , in the case of @xmath30 , we can obtain regular solutions in which the universe bounces at the maximum density , but most solutions tend to the de sitter solution with exponential expansion as @xmath31 increases . in the case of @xmath32 ,",
    "on the other hand , all solutions show exponential expansion in the past and can not bounce .",
    "so they did not analyze the solutions in this case more , because they paid attention only to the bouncing of the universe .",
    "however they found probably first that in spite of the signature of @xmath23 the exponential expansion is caused by the square of the ricci tensor without cosmological constant .    in starobinsky",
    "s treatment[4 ] , the gravitational lagrangian density is similar to that of nt . in the cosmological space - time with the spatial curvature @xmath33 , and without matter , he obtained @xmath34 ^ 2 \\\\ & -\\frac{1}{m^2 } [ 2\\dot{a } { \\ddot{a}}^./a^2 - ( \\ddot{a}/a)^2 + 2\\ddot{a } { \\dot{a}}^2/a^3 - 3(\\dot{a}/a)^4 -2k { \\dot{a}}^2/a^4 + k^2/a^4 ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants ( similar to @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) appearing in the gravitational lagrangian density . comparing eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , we find that , if @xmath37 , the two treatments have the same main terms , if we replace @xmath38 by @xmath39 .",
    "the another term with @xmath40 does not appear in the treatment of nt and seems to have a role to strengthen the de sitter expansion by assuming @xmath41 . in the case of @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath43",
    ", starobinsky finds the solution in which the universe starts from the de sitter expansion and its expansion slows down with time . in the case of @xmath44 ( i.e. @xmath45",
    ", the de sitter expansion grows with time or is `` future stable '' .",
    "it is found therefore that the behaviors in both treatments are consistent , though they may have been interested in different aspects .",
