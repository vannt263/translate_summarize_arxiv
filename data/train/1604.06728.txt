    "cluster algebras were first introduced by s. fomin and a. zelevinsky in @xcite to design an algebraic framework for understanding total positivity and canonical bases for quantum groups .",
    "a cluster algebra is a subring of a rational function field generated by a distinguished set of laurent polynomials called cluster variables .",

    "* * @xmath1-paths : * in @xcite , schiffler ( independently carroll  price and fomin  zelevinsky in their unpublished work ) obtained a formula for the cluster variables of a cluster algebra of finite type @xmath0 ( see  2 for the definition ) in terms of @xmath1-paths . this formula has been modified and generalized to cluster algebras coming from surfaces @xcite . * * perfect matchings of a snake diagram : * a description that is similar to the @xmath1-path model but has a more graph - theoretic flavor @xcite .",
    "interesting combinatorics , for example the snake graph calculus @xcite , arises in the study of this model . this formula is also restricted to cluster algebras coming from surfaces . *",
    "* compatible pairs in a dyck path : * in @xcite , the cluster variables of rank 2 quivers , which do not necessarily come from surfaces , are described in terms of dyck paths . a more general construction of the so - called compatible pairs is used in the study of greedy bases in @xcite , and another generalization called gcc is used in @xcite .",
    "* * broken lines and theta functions : * discovered in @xcite , they are the most general combinatorial models so far . but the model is mysterious that even the finiteness of the number of broken lines is not immediate from the definition .",
    "our ultimate goal is to find a combinatorial model that is both general and effective in computation . even though this goal appears out of reach for",
    "now , we feel that the model of maximal dyck paths and compatible pairs has the potential to be generalized .",
    "this motivates the main goal of this paper :    _ for a type @xmath0 quiver , give a new formula for the cluster monomials using a combinatorial model similar to compatible pairs , and find the bijections to other known models .",
    "_    we reach this goal by proving three equivalent formulas .     in theorem [ thm:01sequence ] , we give a formula using a sequence of 0 - 1 sequences called gcs ( globally compatible sequence ) , where each vertex of the quiver is assigned a 0 - 1 sequence satisfying a certain compatibility condition .",
    " in theorem [ thm : gccxa ] , we give a formula using globally compatible collections ( gccs ) in dyck paths .",
    "this formula has a similar flavor to the combinatorial formula for greedy bases in @xcite .",
    " in  [ dvecpipe ] , we first use a combinatorial gadget called pipelines to decompose the * d*-vector of a cluster monomial into the ones of cluster variables , then give a formula for cluster variables using gccs in theorem [ mainthm ] .",
    "moreover , we construct a bijection between gcss ( which is equivalent to gccs ) and broken lines in theorem [ mainthm2 ] ( the even rank case ) and [ mainthm2 ] ( the general case ) , which relates our new formula with the theta functions constructed in @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this bijection came as a surprise for us : namely , under our setting , the @xmath2-th number in a gcs ( which is a 0 - 1 sequence ) is 0 if and only if the corresponding broken line bends at the @xmath2-th coordinate hyperplane @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that there could be further connections between our new combinatorial formulas and theta functions , and thus could provide a new approach to understanding broken lines ( which are difficult to describe explicitly in general ) .",
