    "morphologically early type galaxies ( ellipticals and s0s ) inhabit dense regions of the universe such as rich clusters , whilst late type spirals are more common in the field .",
    "this result dates back to the early days of extragalactic astronomy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is still of central importance to our understanding of how galaxies evolve in relation to the large scale structure in which they live .",
    "the composition of the galaxy population in clusters also depends upon redshift : @xcite first showed that the fraction of blue ( implying star forming ) galaxies in clusters increases with redshift to @xmath6 , indicating an evolving population even in these most extreme environments .",
    "morphologically , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d97 ) show that , for bright galaxies at least , the increasing fraction of early - type galaxies since @xmath6 corresponds mainly to lenticular s0 galaxies , with a roughly constant elliptical fraction .",
    "this conclusion was strengthened by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* f00 ) adding clusters from their own data and from the sample of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c98 ) to those of d97 .",
    "they show that the cluster s0 to elliptical ratio is , on average , a factor @xmath7 higher at @xmath8 than at @xmath6 . at higher redshift , there is no evidence for any further evolution of the s0 fraction in clusters to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "individual clusters at @xmath10 exhibit a large scatter in their morphological composition , correlating with level of substructure and concentration , especially of elliptical galaxies , in these clusters ( d97,f00 ) . indeed , accounting for the possible bias of the classifier , @xcite and @xcite discuss individual clusters at intermediate redshift with s0 to elliptical ratios consistent with those at @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to relate the cluster to cluster scatter in galaxy properties and dependence on substructure at intermediate redshift to the formation history of the cluster , which can be quite different within the @xmath11cdm paradigm of bottom - up structure growth .",
    "the presence of strong relations at @xmath8 between morphological composition and cluster - centric radius @xcite , and local density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d80 ) imply that by that time the galaxy population has reacted to its environment over the hubble time in a predictable fashion .",
    "the morphology - density relation of d80 extends to low concentration clusters and to galaxy groups @xcite , and so the integrated evolutionary history seems to be predictable even on these scales .",
    "nonetheless , differences from the average morphology - density relation are still evident at @xmath8 : relatively massive , evolved x - ray bright groups have a lower spiral fraction than do clusters at similar physical density @xcite , whilst compact groups have higher spiral fractions @xcite at high projected density .    to explain the evolution of morphology - density relations and the fraction of s0 galaxies , it is necessary to invoke morphology - changing processes which react to the local environment , and can be active on group scales .",
    "in fact , if s0 formation takes place in groups and/or even lower density environments , then this can have a profound effect on the overall galaxy population , since @xmath12 of all galaxies are in groups by @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this kind of pre - processing can also drive the evolution of the cluster population .",
    "for example the evolving fraction of s0s in clusters might result from the evolving population of newly accreted galaxies from infalling groups and the field .",
    "similar ideas have been invoked to explain the evolving dependence of the fraction of star forming galaxies on cluster mass @xcite and the spectrophotometric properties of s0 and `` passive spiral '' populations in clusters ( * ? ? ? * although note that the emission line threshold used to define  passive spirals  is not enough to ensure a complete lack of star formation @xcite ) . at intermediate redshift the members of optically selected groups ( wilman et al .",
    ", 2005a ) and even more massive x - ray selected groups ( * ? ? ?",
    "* j07 ) vary strongly on a group to group basis , from elliptical / passive galaxy dominated to spiral / star forming galaxy dominated .",
    "this does not appear to be as well correlated with velocity dispersion or local density as in low redshift groups @xcite .",
    "therefore it is likely that this is a critical regime and epoch , in which important evolutionary processes have been felt by galaxies in some but not all groups , as a function of their environmental history .",
    "we have compiled a sample of @xmath13 groups , selected in redshift space from the cnoc2 ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) redshift survey ( * ? ? ? * wilman et al . , 2005a ) .",
    "our multiwavelength dataset includes deep , high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) observations of these groups , for which galaxies have been morphologically classified . with this dataset",
    "it is possible to address directly the importance of s0 formation in galaxy groups at intermediate redshift , and assess their importance in driving the evolving fraction of s0s in clusters via pre - processing .",
    "this complements @xcite in which the bulge - disk decomposition software gim2d,@xcite was applied to our sample , allowing separate investigations of bulge and disk components and their dependence on the group environment .",
    "data and sample selection are presented in section  [ sec : data ] , including a discussion of the morphological classification process .",
    "section  [ sec : composition ] presents the morphological composition of group and field samples as a function of luminosity , and differences with environment are assessed for statistical significance at fixed luminosity .",
    "segregation within groups is then investigated in section  [ sec : radialtrends ] , by looking for trends of composition with distance from the centre of groups .",
    "the morphological composition of our group and field samples are put into context in section  [ sec : disc ] by comparing with that seen in other cluster and group samples as a function of redshift .",
    "this leads to the conclusion , summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] , that s0 formation preferentially occurs in the group environment .",

    "spectroscopic redshifts , mainly in the range 0.1@xmath230.55 exist for a large and unbiased sample of @xmath24 galaxies @xcite .",
    "galaxy groups have been identified by applying a friends of friends algorithm to detect significant overdensities in redshift space , with parameters tuned to pick up virialized systems",
    "@xcite : in practice this means that group selection is tuned such that at least three galaxies with cnoc2 redshifts are clustered tightly enough that they appear at least 200 times overdense with respect to the critical density .",
    "whilst incompleteness in the cnoc2 survey leads to incompleteness in the group sample ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , the selection is unbiased and well suited to study the influence of the group environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "supplementary spectroscopy was collected for twenty cnoc2 groups at 0.3@xmath230.55 using the ldss-2 multi - object spectrograph on the magellan 6.5 m telescope to reach an unbiased limit of @xmath25 for spectroscopy and improving the completeness for these systems within 180  ( wilman et al . , 2005a ) .",
    "we call this the * r22 * sample .",
    "six serendipitous @xmath26 cnoc2 groups in these fields brings the number of r22 groups to 26 .",

    "this data is processed using the acs pipeline @xcite , producing a fully astrometrically calibrated and undistorted image from the highly distorted acs focal surface .",
    "other basic calibration procedures which have been applied automatically before we retrieved the data include bias and dark subtraction and flat fielding . to create a suitable final image with cosmic rays and hot pixels removed we reapply the _ multidrizzle _ task in _ pyraf _ which recombines the dithered images into an undistorted and well - sampled median image in wcs coordinates .",

    "close examination of the r22 groups reveals significant substructure in many cases .",
    "this implies an important role for recent accretion onto groups from the surrounding filamentary structure , although group cores may be virialized in most cases .",
    "substructure and low number statistics also influence our computed velocity dispersions , which may be overestimated when compared to the stacked weak lensing signal , especially in more massive groups @xcite .",
    "the acs field of view is 202  @xmath30 202 , corresponding to an angular distance of @xmath31 at @xmath32 and @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "centred on a targetted group , this means full coverage with acs to @xmath35 at @xmath36 , or the virial radius of a relatively massive @xmath37  km  s@xmath38 group at this redshift .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty on velocity dispersion , and the un - virialized state of many groups , we prefer to keep everything within the r22 sample and with acs coverage ( the * acsr22 * sample ) , rather than applying any additional radial cut .",
    "the resultant sample of morphologically classified group galaxies is inevitably biased towards members of smaller , more compact groups , sampling only the cores of more massive or loose groups .",
    "therefore the sample will suffer little contamination from galaxies unbound to the group ( which , if they are assigned to groups at all , will tend towards large group - centric radii ) , whilst the influence of group - centric radius on morphological composition will be investigated in section  [ sec : radialtrends ] .",
    "bias resulting from the small variation of radial limits with redshift within the sample is unimportant , as evolutionary trends at @xmath13 are not investigated in this paper .",

    "this allows faint features at the galaxy outskirts to be identified as well as bright central features .",
    "most classifications should be robust to within @xmath62 hubble type as in @xcite .",
    "galaxies are classified in a random order so that the classifier has no prior knowledge of group membership .",
    "therefore the comparison between group and field samples is not biased by any prior knowledge of environment by the classifier .",
    "+ the most difficult classification decisions are :    * * e vs s0 , for anything other than edge on objects : * this relies on seeing a break in the surface brightness gradient ( for s0s ) and requires a careful look through the entire range of stretches of the image .",

    "222 are identical , and of the remaining 88 , 69 differ by 0.5 in hubble type , 17 differ by 1 and just 2 by 1.5 . the final classification is selected by taking the average hubble type , rounding to the nearest full type where there is 0.5 or 1.5 difference . in only 2 cases does one classifier select sa and the other s0/a : on these occasions the sa classification is selected . there is also a single case of e / s0 and s0 classifications : here",
    "the s0 classification is preferred .",
    "final classifications for a random selection of galaxies are illustrated in figure  [ figure : pstamp ] of appendix  [ app : pstamp ] .",
    "it should be noted that these classifications differ slightly from those presented by @xcite , in which classifications from a single author ( ao ) were used .",
    "we group galaxies into six broader categories of morphology .",
    "this avoids oversampling the hubble sequence , and limits the effects of scatter between hubble types .",
    "the broader categories are : * e * ( e , e / s0 ) , * s0 * ( s0/e , s0 , s0 , s0/a , sb0/a ) , * early - type spiral , esp * ( sa - sbc , including barred spirals ) , * late - type spiral , lsp * ( sc - sm , including barred spirals ) , * irregular , irr * ( irr , ? ) and * merger , m * ( m or x ) .",
    "however in most of our analysis the spirals are grouped together into a single category .",
    "peculiar `` _ _ pec _ _ '' qualifications are ignored at this stage .    to understand the nature of galaxies classified as s0 , it is important to recognize that , other than the existence of both bulge and disk components , there is no bulge to total ratio requirement for an s0 . as understanding the environment of s0s is central to our science , it is important to understand any classification bias or selection effects which might influence what is classified or mis - classified as an s0 ( or which should have been classified s0 , but was not ) .    to address this question ,",
    "the gim2d bulge / disk decompositions of @xcite provide complimentary parameteric information about the galaxy morphologies .",
    "simultaneous fitting of bulge and disk components provides , amongst other things , bulge to total ratio ( b / t ) , and disk inclination angles ( i ) .",
    "figure  [ figure : btdiscinctype ] shows the distribution of gim2d derived bulge to disk ratios ( b / t ) , and disk inclination for galaxies which are visually classified as s0s , and esps .",
    "although bulge to disk luminosity does not factor in the decision to call a galaxy s0 , it is clear from the top panels that the distribution of b / t is peaked to much larger b / t for s0s than for early type spiral galaxies .",
    "the sin(i ) curve ( smooth solid line in the bottom panels ) shows what would be expected for a purely random distribution of disk inclination .",
    "s0 galaxies appear to be slightly biased towards large inclination angles , compared to random .",
    "this indicates that either the automated fitting biases this parameter , or that the visual morphological classification is biased against finding s0 types for low inclination angles .",
    "as it is difficult to identify disks in @xmath21face - on bulge+disk systems with less obvious spiral structure , then it is likely that this bias is present in our sample .",
    "this might lead to an underestimate of the total s0 fraction .",
    "however we note that some galaxies are fit with pure bulge or disk components , and in these cases the disk inclination angle is not provided ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this incompleteness makes any quantification of the s0 fraction underestimate impossible .",
    "however the estimated fraction should be consistent with other studies which will suffer from the same biases .",
    "figure  [ figure : fraccomp ] shows the fraction of elliptical ( e ) , s0 and spiral ( esp@xmath5lsp ) galaxies in four bins of @xmath44-band luminosity ( @xmath63 - 22 , 1-mag bins down to -20 , and a faint bin @xmath2 - 20 ) in both group and field environments .",
    "the fraction of early - type spirals ( esp ) is also indicated ( squares ) .",
    "it is clearly important to examine these trends not only as a function of environment but also as a function of galaxy luminosity or mass , since this can be as , if not more important to determine a galaxy s properties including morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed the morphological composition of both group and field environments is a strong function of luminosity for our sample .",
    "vertical dotted lines indicate luminosity limits at z=0.55 ( @xmath21 - 21.1 ) and z=0.3 ( @xmath21 - 19.1 ) given the maximum k - correction of a normal galaxy .",
    "fainter than -21.1 lower redshift galaxies will stay in the sample whilst higher redshift galaxies are too faint .",
    "more importantly , redder galaxies will more easily fall out of the sample than bluer galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "however this will apply equally to group and field galaxies , and so , qualitatively , the dependence of morphological composition on environment should be robust down to faint luminosities .",
    "quantitatively , a higher fraction of red , early type objects might be underestimated due to the more frequent loss of red galaxies .",
    "this will be a small effect , working only to reduce the significance of our results , and can thus be ignored . in the following analysis a luminosity limit of @xmath64 is applied , excluding only the faintest objects .",
    "contrasting the group and field compositions , it is surprising to find no highly significant difference in the fraction of ellipticals at fixed luminosity .",
    "contrarily , the fraction of s0s is clearly a strong function of environment . in groups ,",
    "s0s contribute 40/178 ( weighted fraction 25% ) of all classified galaxies compared to just 10/109 ( weighted fraction 8% ) in the field . a fisher s exact",
    "test gives a probability of 0.0005% ( 0.0038% unweighted ) that the group and field samples are randomly extracted from the same underlying population .",
    "galaxies in groups are also biased towards high luminosity with respect to field galaxies .",
    "this is true in our sample ( see wilman et al . , 2005a ) , and is consistent with the literature ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to examine the underlying probability distribution more accurately ,",
    "taking account of the luminosity bias , we apply a monte carlo method .",
    "this procedure is designed to remove the bias , and test the significance of different morphological compositions at fixed luminosity .",
    "each group galaxy is selected in turn , and one of the five field galaxies nearest in luminosity is randomly selected for a `` mock group '' sample .",
    "@xmath65 such mock group samples are constructed , and in each one the fraction of s0 type galaxies is computed . in none of @xmath65 mock groups is the s0 fraction as high as that in the real group sample .",
    "this is equivalent to the probability that the group and field subsamples are taken from the same underlying sample , and corresponds to a significant excess of s0s in groups at a confidence level of @xmath299.999% ( @xmath24.25@xmath66 for a one - tailed gaussian distribution , corresponding to the statistical resolution of the resampling process ) . as the group and field samples are roughly equivalent ( and relatively small ) in number , the reverse exercise is also applied to check for consistency .",
    "i.e. the fraction of mock field samples ( constructed using the group sample ) with s0 fraction as low as the real field sample is computed ( in an identical fashion to that described above ) .",
    "this results in a confidence level of 99.876% ( 2.8@xmath66 ) that a deficit of s0s exists in the field sample ( compared to the groups ) .",
    "although less significant due to subtle differences , this supports the result that there is a excess of s0s in groups , independent of galaxy luminosity .    to ensure this is not merely a result of including the most massive groups / clusters in the group sample ,",
    "the 2 groups with @xmath67  kms@xmath38 ( g138 and g38 ) are excluded .",
    "this results in 30/145 ( weighted fraction 23% ) s0s in the sample , and repeating the bootstrapping procedure indicates this still corresponds to a confidence level of 99.995% ( 3.9@xmath66 ) for the excess .",
    "the result is also robust against the inclusion of s0/a galaxies in the s0 sample .",
    "this accounts for 30% of both field and group s0 populations .",
    "the same procedure has been applied to show that there is no significant excess of ellipticals in groups at fixed luminosity ( @xmath2115% probability that the difference arises randomly ) although the absolute fraction of ellipticals is much higher , with 43/178 ( weighted fraction 22% ) compared to 15/109 ( weighted fraction 13% ) in the field .",
    "i.e. this difference is mainly driven by the environmental dependence of the luminosity function ( a high fraction of the brightest galaxies are ellipticals , see figure  [ figure : fraccomp ] ) .",
    "the deficit of spiral galaxies in groups exists at a confidence level of 99.953% ( @xmath68 ) , and is seen most clearly in the late - type spiral population ( lsp , composed of sc and later types ) .      whilst it is clear that galaxy properties including morphology must be somehow influenced by the group environment , even at fixed luminosity , there are many ways in which this could be realised . to gain further insight into the possible mechanisms involved , it is desirable to see how morphology depends not only on whether a galaxy is a member of a group but also the nature of that group and of the galaxy s local environment .",

    "it is clearly impossible to create a perfectly equivalent set of clusters or cluster galaxies , given the intrinsic variance in properties and formation histories . adding the redshift or environment axes simply adds to the complexity of this comparison , introducing amongst other things a variation of the galaxy mass function on redshift and environment .",
    "statistical errors are relatively large , since the luminosity limit applied here samples only the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "other potential errors include classification bias , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .    despite these many problems ,",

    "as we have seen , the s0 fraction in optically selected cnoc2 groups is at least as high as that seen in clusters at the same redshift .",

    "thus , the evolution in group s0 fraction likely parallels the evolution in star forming fraction ( e.g. wilman et al .",
    ", 2005b ; * ? ? ?",
    "this contrasts with the lack of evolution in the elliptical fraction which remains low at all redshifts , even in clusters .",
    "bright ( @xmath110 ) ellipticals exist with similar frequency in all environments , although they are more likely to be found towards the centre of halos .    our result - that s0s are more common in groups than in less dense field environments - implies that environment is a relevant factor in their formation , and that internal secular processes ( in any case expected to lead to the formation of star forming pseudobulges , e.g. * ?",
    "* ) may be less important .",
    "however , since s0s are at least as common in less massive optically selected groups as they are in @xmath1 x - ray bright groups and clusters , mechanisms which take place in lower density regimes must be active . even in groups , the mildly significant increase of s0 fraction beyond @xmath111 ( with 97% confidence ) hints at formation in even lower density regimes such as the group outskirts , or pre - processing in galaxy pairs and lower mass groups .",
    "the growth at late times of the s0 population , in all measured environments , suggests that their formation is a slow process .",
    "this is consistent with spectro - photometric properties of s0 galaxies in infalling groups and cluster outskirts at @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "finally the early - type spiral population is approximately consistent with that seen in the field , at fixed luminosity , whilst there is a clear deficit of late ( sc+ ) type spirals .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite that the relationship between spiral fraction and density in ediscs clusters is driven by sc+ type spirals .",
    "converting late - type spiral galaxies into s0s is not a straightforward business , as it involves significant bulge growth even at fixed luminosity in order to match the b / t distribution of s0s ( figure  [ figure : btdiscinctype ] ) .",
    "however the total luminosity of many z@xmath210.4 spirals is sufficient for them to be progenitors of a typical group s0 ( see figure  [ figure : fraccomp ] ) .",
    "bulge growth may or may not be related to the actual suppression of star formation and spiral arms in s0s , but the two processes are certainly correlated . if bulge growth is achieved via formation of new stars , this puts a lower limit on the level of star formation required .",
    "let us assume an extreme case in which a z@xmath400.4 pure disk galaxy ( b / t@xmath400 ) will become a massive s0 galaxy with stellar mass @xmath113 and @xmath114 by z@xmath400 .",
    "this corresponds to a total bulge mass growth of @xmath115 within @xmath116 which requires a bulge star formation rate of sfr@xmath117 .",
    "a significant population of infrared - bright spiral galaxies exists at 0.4@xmath118z@xmath1181 , for which star formation rates of @xmath119 have been derived @xcite .",
    "most of this star formation is obscured at optical wavelengths @xcite , and these galaxies tend to exist on the outskirts of clusters @xcite , and in intermediate density environments , corresponding to groups and sub - groups @xcite . at lower redshifts ,",
    "optically red 24-emitting galaxies still prefer intermediate density environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "preliminary analysis of 24  data shows that these galaxies frequently form stars at rates @xmath120 ( tyler et al , in prep ) .",
    "therefore the data do support a mode of bulge growth involving star formation which is most easily visible at infrared wavelengths , and which prefers group and sub - group environments .    in these relatively low density environments , interactions with the intra - group medium ( igm ) , including a gentler strangulation / starvation of the galaxies hot gas halo , are not likely to be as important as they would be in the group cores , x - ray groups and clusters . to promote slow bulge growth in low density environments",
    ", we suggest that minor mergers ( supported by the existence of kinematically decoupled young cores , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy harassment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and tidal interactions between galaxies are more likely to be relevant ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more discussion ) .",
    "each of these mechanisms is capable of funnelling material to the central bulge over a long timescale , and so a massive starburst is not required .",
    "harassment and tidal interactions in particular might also promote an infrared - bright mode of star formation @xcite , although neither mechanism has yet been investigated in detail at the group scale .",
    "however in each case it is unclear how star formation is eventually suppressed : possibly there is a role for feedback from agn , given that black hole growth should accompany bulge growth .",
    "indeed , bulge growth in low density environments should be expected , since it is typical of the environment in which high - accretion , optically selected agn are known to reside ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , a dominant route to the formation of s0 galaxies in the group or sub - group environment has important implications for galaxy evolution studies : most galaxies in the universe are experiencing a group like environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which s0 formation processes might be important .",
    "this means that the quenching of star formation associated with the formation of an s0 might contribute significantly to the global decline in star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pre - processing in groups is also likely to dominate the production of cluster s0s , helping to explain the lack of any strong relationship between s0 fraction and cluster - centric radius or local density ( e.g. d80,d97,f00 ) .",
    "this might still be supplemented by the formation of some s0s in more isolated environments by secular processes ( i.e. there are some field s0s in our sample , although note the definition of field in section  [ sec : sample ] ) , or by stripping processes in clusters @xcite . the distribution of b / t for visually classified s0s as a function of environment might help disentangle these different routes .",
    "the end result for clusters is that the increasing s0 fraction and evolving morphology - density relation ( including a declining spiral fraction and stronger relations at low z for low concentration clusters ( d97 ) and groups @xcite ) is imprinted by the accumulated accretion history of pre - processed galaxies onto that cluster .",
    "with high resolution acs imaging of our well studied sample of optically selected galaxy groups from the cnoc2 galaxy survey at @xmath89 , we have been able to visually classify the morphologies of 179 spectrally confirmed group galaxies and 111 field galaxies in this redshift range .",
    "this provides good enough statistics to examine the morphological composition of galaxies in this important environment at @xmath1 .    for the first time",
    ", we directly address the question of whether the strong increase of s0 fraction in galaxy clusters since @xmath1 is a result of pre - processing in groups and lower density environments . within our sample , there is a much higher fraction of s0s in groups than in the lower density field at fixed luminosity , that can not be reproduced by resampling the field population with @xmath299.999% confidence .",
    "there is also a hint that s0s in groups are less common within 0.3h@xmath4mpc of the group centres than at larger distances ( 97% confidence ) .",
    "in contrast to the situation for s0s , the fraction of elliptical galaxies at fixed luminosity is not significantly enhanced in groups compared to the field .",

    "it is also interesting that ( particularly faint , -21.0@xmath122 - 19.0 ) late - type spirals are more common in the inner group regions ( @xmath630.3h@xmath4mpc ) than at larger group - centric radii ( with a confidence level of 99.85% ) .    we have compared the s0 fraction computed for the cnoc2 groups and field samples with a compilation of clusters over the redshift range @xmath123 ( f00,d80,d97,c98,d07 ) and x - ray selected groups at @xmath1 ( j07 ) and @xmath8 ( m09 ) .",
    "s0s are present with at least as high ( and possibly enhanced ) fractions in optical groups with respect to all other environments , whilst the fraction in x - ray groups is consistent with that in clusters from @xmath8 to @xmath1 . together with the lack of any strong radial trend in groups or clusters , this paints a picture in which low mass groups are likely to be the dominant environment for the formation of s0s , leading to an evolution in the global and cluster s0 fraction as more s0s are formed and accreted onto clusters by the present day .",
    "the combined evidence supports a slow acting mechanism for s0 formation in which starbursts are not usually evident and many s0s are formed at late times ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "we emphasize the importance of bulge growth to match the b / t distribution of s0s , and show that measured star formation rates of infrared bright spiral galaxies in similar environments would be sufficient over a few gigayears .",
    "the favoured candidates are therefore minor mergers , galaxy harassment and tidal interactions .",
    "mechanisms requiring interaction with a bright x - ray emitting igm are ruled out as the likely route to formation for the majority of s0s in the universe .",

    "<S> the low redshift universe ( @xmath0 ) is not a dull place . </S>",
    "<S> processes leading to the suppression of star formation and morphological transformation are prevalent : this is particularly evident in the dramatic upturn in the fraction of s0-type galaxies in clusters . however , until now , the process and environment of formation has remained unidentified . </S>",
    "<S> we present a morphological analysis of galaxies in the optically - selected ( spectroscopic friends - of - friends ) group and field environments at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> groups contain a much higher fraction of s0s at fixed luminosity than the lower density field , with @xmath299.999% confidence . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the s0 fraction in groups is at least as high as in @xmath1 clusters and x - ray selected groups , which have more luminous intra group medium ( igm ) . </S>",
    "<S> an excess of s0s at @xmath30.3h@xmath4mpc from the group centre with respect to the inner regions , existing with 97% confidence at fixed luminosity , tells us that formation is not restricted to , and possibly even avoids , the group cores . </S>",
    "<S> interactions with a bright x - ray emitting igm can not be important for the formation of the majority of s0s in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to s0s , the fraction of elliptical galaxies in groups at fixed luminosity is similar to the field , whilst the brightest ellipticals are strongly enhanced towards the group centres ( @xmath299.999% confidence within 0.3h@xmath4mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , whilst spirals are altogether less common in groups than in the field , there is also an excess of faint , sc@xmath5 type spirals within 0.3h@xmath4mpc of the group centres ( 99.953% confidence ) . we conclude that the group and sub - group environments must be dominant for the formation of s0 galaxies , and that minor mergers , galaxy harassment and tidal interactions are the most likely responsible mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications not only for the inferred pre - processing of cluster galaxies , but also for the global morphological and star formation budget of galaxies : as hierarchical clustering progresses , more galaxies will be subject to these transformations as they enter the group environment . </S>"
