    "one of the important unresolved questions in high-@xmath1 superconductivity is the strength of quantum fluctuations in the superconducting ground state . in this paper",
    "we show that the frequency dependence of the c - axis conductivity is a useful probe of the strength of these fluctuations .",
    "our results apply , with minor modifications which are indicated at appropriate points below , to any sufficiently anisotropic superconductor and therefore may also be useful for interpreting data on layered organic superconductors and on the spin - ladder compounds .",
    "another important issue concerns the nature of the electronic states in the @xmath2 planes of high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "we will show that the c - axis conductivity can be used to extract information about these states .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we presented a theory for the c - axis optical spectral weight of layered superconducting systems .",
    "we showed , among other things , that the strength of the quantum fluctuations could be inferred from the ratio of the spectral weight in the c - axis superfluid response to the spectral weight lost from the c - axis conductivity as the temperature is decreased from high @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "a ratio of one indicates mean - field like superconductivity with negligible quantum phase fluctuations , whereas a ratio greater than one shows that quantum fluctuations are important . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that quantum and thermal fluctuations also have important consequences for the form of the c - axis conductivity .",
    "in particular , if quantum fluctuations are significant , then under conditions believed to occur in high-@xmath0 materials , @xmath5 acquires a peak for frequencies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the superconducting gap .",
    "our previous spectral weight analysis provided evidence for strong quantum fluctuations in @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite but not in @xmath10 or @xmath11 @xcite and a peak in @xmath5 is found in the former material but not in the latter two @xcite .",
    "the qualitative idea behind our calculations is as follows .",
    "we consider materials , such as the high-@xmath0 superconductors , which consist of weakly coupled layers .",
    "the weak interlayer coupling means that the conductivity may be calculated by second order perturbation theory in the interplane coupling , and is therefore given by a convolution of two in - plane green functions @xcite .",
    "thus , as emphasized by anderson @xcite , the c - axis conductivity is in effect a spectroscopy of the in - plane properties . in this paper",
    "we show by explicit calculation in several models what can be learned from this spectroscopy .",
    "specific details of the high @xmath0 crystal chemistry imply @xcite that in these materials the interlayer coupling is dominated by the states near @xmath12 points of the two dimensional brillouin zone , where the superconducting gap is maximal .",
    "the c - axis conductivity thus reflects properties of electronic states near these points .",
    "the in - plane green function of high @xmath0 superconductors has been studied by photoemission spectroscopy and in the superconducting state at the momenta relevant for the interplane conductivity is very small for frequencies @xmath13 less than the gap energy , @xmath14 and has a peak for @xmath15 , ( which is interpreted as a quasiparticle pole ) , followed by a shallower minimum at an energy @xmath16 followed by a broad continuum , interpreted as the incoherent part of the spectral function .",
    "this structure has been referred to as `` peak - dip - hump '' .    in the usual theory of superconductivity @xcite , which neglects phase fluctuations ,",
    "the type ii coherence factors associated with conductivity mean that the quasiparticle peak in @xmath17 would not contribute to @xmath18 which would therefore vanish at the gap edge , @xmath19 , and only begin to rise when the incoherent part of @xmath17 appears .",
    "there would be no sharp structure in @xmath20 corresponding to the sharp structure in @xmath21 .",
    "however , we shall show that if phase fluctuations are important , then the effect of the coherence factors is reduced and the quasiparticles contribute , leading to a peak in @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the c - axis conductivity is a useful spectroscopy of in - plane properties only if the tunnelling matrix element is known . in this paper",
    "we assume it has the usual band theory form , namely an interplane hopping which conserves in - plane momentum .",
    "a large literature exists in which the anomalous properties of the c - axis conductivity are attributed to a highly non - trivial interplane coupling , in which passage from one plane to another involves a strong scattering from some excitation or defect which resides between planes and does not couple to in - plane electron motion : see , for example , @xcite and references therein . as discussed in section",
    "vi , we believe there is substantial experimental evidence against this proposal . in any event , the theory of the effect of superconductivity on @xmath22 in the more straightforward case of conventional interplane tunnelling and anomalous in - plane properties is given in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents a model for the in - plane green function introduced by norman _",
    "et al _ @xcite and similar in many respects to a model of chubukov and co - workers @xcite .",
    "section iii uses the model to obtain formulas for @xmath5 and shows how quantum and thermal fluctuations affect the results .",
    "section iv evaluates the results in several limits .",
    "section v discusses the f - sum - rule spectral weight , section vi compares our results to data and to alternate theories , and section vii is a conclusion and discussion of open problems .",
    "readers uninterested in the technical details of the calculation are advised to read section ii and then proceed to sections vi and vii .",
    "the peak - dip - hump structure discussed above is generally agreed @xcite to imply that the electrons in high-@xmath24 materials are subject to a strong scattering due ultimately to an electron - electron interaction  strong , because the spectral function at fixed momentum is spread over a wide energy range , and due to electron - electron interaction because the opening of the superconducting gap changes the form of the scattering , and in particular weakens it at low frequencies . because in optimally doped and underdoped materials the normal state spectral function is spread over a wide frequency range and has only a weak structure at fixed momentum near @xmath25 the imaginary part of the normal state self energy must be large and only weakly frequency dependent .",
    "one theoretical model which leads to such a self energy involves electrons scattered by some bosonic mode , which is thought of as an electronic collective mode and has spectral weight concentrated near @xmath26 in the normal state .",
    "if this mode has electronic origin it must acquire a gap or pseudogap in the superconducting state .",
    "following refs @xcite we assume that the mode has a gap , @xmath27 , at @xmath28 where the peak - dip - hump structure is observed , but has no gap ( @xmath29 ) at @xmath30 , where the structure is not observed .",
    "conventional impurity scattering corresponds to @xmath31 in both normal and superconducting states .",
    "electron - electron scattering in an s - wave superconductor at @xmath4 would lead to an @xmath32 of the order of @xmath33 @xcite but possibly reduced by excitonic effects . in a two - dimensional d - wave superconductor ( such as high-@xmath0 materials",
    "are believed to be ) , one would expect a small @xmath34 contribution at low frequencies from states near the gap nodes .",
    "we will ignore this small effect , and interpret @xmath32 as the scale at which the scattering returns to its @xmath35 value .    in underdoped cuprates the electron spectral function ( and many other properties )",
    "exhibits a pseudogap in a wide range of temperatures above @xmath0 .",
    "the pseudogap is the superconducting energy gap , which seems @xcite in underdoped materials to persist in a wide range of temperatures above the resistively defined @xmath0 . in these materials",
    "the superconducting transition corresponds to the onset of long ranged phase coherence @xcite .",
    "the peak - dip - hump structure seems to be associated with the establishment of phase coherence , and not with the formation of the gap .",
    "this behavior is not at present understood @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we simply assume it occurs and examine its consequences for the c - axis conductivity .    for several reasons , including that discussed just above , the properties of the mode required by the models of refs @xcite seem somewhat unusual , raising the question of whether a description in terms of scattering of conventional electrons off of a bosonic mode is the physically correct one .",
    "the models however are reasonably successful in fitting the electron spectral function , and this is all that we require here",
    ". the issue of the proper physical picture of the unusual behavior of the electron spectral function is , however , a crucial issue in the physics of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "we return to it in the conclusion .",
    "we now turn to the mathematical formalism we need",
    ".    we may write in general for the normal ( @xmath36 ) and anomalous ( @xmath37 ) propagators in matsubara formalism :    @xmath38    and    @xmath39    here @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the renormalization function defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the self energy which contains the effects of coupling to the mode which produces the strong normal - state scattering .",
    "the approximation of norman et .",
    "@xcite , which is adequate for our purposes and which we adopt henceforth , consists of neglecting the frequency dependence of @xmath7 and the momentum dependence of @xmath45 .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath46 is given by    @xmath47 -cc   \\label{z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this form corresponds to a single - particle scattering rate which tends to @xmath48 for @xmath49 and reduces to the familiar expressions for a dirty superconductor when @xmath50 .",
    "the observed @xcite frequency independence of @xmath51 at @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 leads us to choose @xmath54 . at large frequencies we therefore have very strongly scattered electrons , corresponding to an @xmath55 which is small @xmath56 and essentially independent of @xmath57 .",
    "however , for @xmath58 z is real , so g will have a pole at a frequency @xmath59 if @xmath60 . a large @xmath61 such as we have assumed implies that @xmath62 so the quasiparticles have small weight and negligible dispersion .",
    "refs @xcite argue that the combination of a large @xmath61 and an @xmath31 in the superconducting state but not in the normal state accounts for the peaks observed in photoemission experiments at @xmath63 but not for @xmath52 @xcite .    the resulting spectral function is shown in fig .  1 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "here the quasiparticle pole is shown as a sharp line and its strength corresponds to the area in the shaded box .",
    "the onset of scattering at @xmath66 causes the broad only weakly frequency dependent continuum .    *",
    "fig . 1 * imaginary part of the electron green function for parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the quasiparticle peak is indicated by the vertical line ; its weight is shown as the shaded box .    the spectral function predicted by eq .",
    "[ z ] was fit to photoemission data by ref @xcite .",
    "differences between the data and the model were attributed by ref @xcite to an extra elastic scattering term and to an extrinsic background .",
    "the elastic scattering was introduced to broaden the low frequency peak , which is a delta function in the model ; we feel the observed broadness is more likely due to a variation of the gap over the surface of the sample , but in any event this extra broadening ( which we do not include ) will not affect our results in any significant way .",
    "the extrinsic background requires more discussion . in the data analysed in ref @xcite the weight in the quasiparticle peak was somewhat smaller than the missing area obtained by multiplying the higher @xmath69 value of i",
    "m g by the frequency interval @xmath70 .",
    "as can be seen from our fig . 1 , in the strong coupling limit of the model self energy the strength of the quasiparticle peak is in fact somewhat larger than this missing area .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "7 apparently dealt with this discrepancy by introducing an additional extrinsic background , non - zero only for @xmath71 , and adjusted so the weight in the observed quasiparticle peak is roughly equal to the missing area calculated from the background - subtracted part of i m g. it seems to us that the discrepancy requires further consideration ; however , the issue is not crucial to the present paper , which focusses on the qualitative consequences for the c - axis conductivity of the quasiparticle peak in i m g.",
    "we now consider the effect of our chosen form of @xmath36 and @xmath37 on @xmath72 , focussing on the extent to which the quasiparticle poles contribute to the observed conductivity and on the effects of the offset @xmath32 .",
    "we emphasize that for these considerations the precise forms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not matter , as long as they have the general properties outlined above .",
    "we assume the hamiltonian is @xmath73 here @xmath74 creates an electron of in - plane momentum @xmath75 and spin @xmath76 on plane @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 contains the ( presumably nontrivial ) physics of a single @xmath79 plane , and in particular leads to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 functions discussed in the previous section .",
    "we calculate the interplane conductivity in the usual way , representing the c - direction electric field by a vector potential @xmath80 and coupling it to @xmath81 via the peierls substitution ( in units @xmath82 ) @xmath83 with d the interplane spacing .",
    "we expand to second order in @xmath84 finding @xcite    @xmath85    we have omitted dimensional factors of @xmath86 and lattice constants , which are not relevant to our arguments .",
    "it is convenient to consider separately contributions to the polarizibility @xmath87 coming from the different parts of the fermi surface ( as labeled by @xmath88 ) and separate @xmath87 into normal and anomalous parts , as    @xmath89    with @xmath90    here @xmath91 , @xmath92 and here and in many places subsequently the @xmath88 label on the @xmath93 functions has been suppressed .",
    "the diamagnetic term k may be written @xmath94    we have written the ff term as an expectation value because it depends on the interlayer phase coherence.to study the phase coherence properties in more detail we write the f - f correlator in real space and separate out the term involving the phase difference , finding @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the usual convolution of f - functions with phases set to 0 and may be calculated by standard methods @xcite . in the bcs approximation",
    "the phases do not fluctuate : @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the actual materials",
    "the phase in each plane fluctuates . in the pseudogap regime of underdoped materials",
    "the superconductivity is destroyed by phase fluctuations while the amplitude of the gap remains nonzero @xcite . for @xmath99",
    "the phase has a nonzero average but may fluctuate .",
    "we write @xmath100 . at @xmath101 thermal fluctuations are negligible . in the two - dimensional case of present interest ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are dominated by short length scales and so are uncorrelated from plane to plane , @xmath102 .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the correlator entirely in terms of in - plane properties , at low @xmath3 .",
    "unlike quantum fluctuations , two - dimensional thermal fluctuations are dominated by length scales of the order of the thermal coherence length @xmath103 which diverges at @xmath1 .",
    "interplane phase correlations are important if the josephson energy of a correlated region is larger than the temperature , i.e. if @xmath104 ; where @xmath105 is the in - plane density of states and the standard dirty - limit factor @xmath106 reflects the fact that the weight in the c - axis conductivity is spread over a wide frequency range of order @xmath61 , so only the fraction @xmath107 is available to contribute to the josephson coupling .",
    "the small values of interplane couplings and @xmath107 relevant to high-@xmath1 materials mean that this criterion is only satisfied for temperatures very near @xmath1 .",
    "thus except very near to @xmath1 we have @xmath108 in other words in @xmath109 the effect of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations is to renormalize the interplane @xmath110 correlator by a constant debye - waller factor @xmath111 with @xmath112 . in @xmath113",
    "the phase fluctuation integral has a logarithmic divergence cut off by @xmath84 or the length and time scale , so the debye - waller factor will have scale or @xmath84 dependence .",
    "we shall be interested in either a strongly scattered normal state or in @xmath114 so we take the @xmath115 limits of the formulas .",

    "we begin with the case @xmath31 i.e. with strong scattering unaffected by the onset of phase coherence .",
    "results are shown in fig . 2 for this choice of @xmath32 ,",
    "the real part of the normal state conductivity is @xmath125 .",
    "we have chosen a very large @xmath61 so the normal conductivity is a straight line with value @xmath126 .",
    "the light solid line depicts the conductivity of the fully phase coherent ( @xmath127 ) superconducting state .",
    "the coherence factor effects , namely @xmath128 and the gradual onset of absorbtion as @xmath69 is increased above @xmath19 , are evident .",
    "also shown as the heavy solid line in fig .",
    "2 is the no - phase coherence ( @xmath129 ) conductivity .",
    "the coherence factor effects are absent , so the conductivity rises discontinuously from the gap edge ( in our approximation , which neglects angular variations of the gap ) and is always larger than the phase - coherent @xmath76 .",
    "no sharp structure is visible in either calculation because everywhere an excitation is allowed , the damping is large .    in the @xmath31 case",
    "the conductivity in the presence of the gap is always less then the normal state ( @xmath130 ) conductivity . in the fully phase coherent ( @xmath131 ) case",
    "there is also a delta function contribution ( not shown ) ; the weight in the delta function exactly equals the difference of the fully phase coherent curve from 1 . in the @xmath129 case",
    "the lack of phase coherence means that there is no superfluid delta - function  the conductivity spectral weight is less than in either the no - gap case or the fully phase coherent state .",
    "the spectral weight will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",

    "we now turn to the effects of the offset .",
    "we begin by considering in fig .",
    "3 the conductivity of a non - paired ( @xmath130 ) state at @xmath4 , for different values of @xmath32 . to facilitate comparison with subsequent figures we measure frequencies and the offset in units of @xmath14 , but we emphasize that these curves pertain to the non - paired state . at @xmath31",
    "we would have a lorentzian of half - width @xmath67 and value 1 at @xmath135 ; this is not shown in the figure .",
    "we see from the three displayed curves that @xmath136 ( except for a delta - function contribution of relative strength @xmath137 ) which is not explicitly shown ) .",
    "the conductivity has a complicated dependence on the combination of scattering rate and offset : if @xmath138 is sufficiently small ( as occurs in the displayed @xmath139 and @xmath68 traces ) the conductivity can rise above the no - offset value ( basically , @xmath140 ) for a @xmath61-dependent range of @xmath69 ; for larger offsets ( e.g the @xmath141 ) trace , the conductivity is always lower .",
    "the total weight ( including the delta - function contribution ) is conserved as a function of @xmath32 , but as can be seen from the high frequency behavior of the curves , the differences between @xmath76 calculated with different @xmath32 persist up to very high frequencies , so making accurate statements about differences in integrated area requires integration over frequencies of order @xmath61 .    *",
    "3 * optical conductivity in normal state as function of mode offset @xmath32 for @xmath67 .",
    "we next show in fig .",

    "comparison to the appropriate curve in fig .",
    "3 shows that convergence to the @xmath130 case of the same @xmath32 is very slow .",
    "we have verified that the area including the superfluid delta function ( not shown ) is conserved , but one must integrate to frequencies of order @xmath61 to capture all of the spectral weight .",
    "we now consider the opposite case , namely that the interplane quantum fluctuations are so strong that @xmath146 is negligible . in this case",
    "@xmath147 is determined from @xmath148 alone and the resulting conductivity is shown as the upper line in fig .  4 .",
    "a quasiparticle contribution is evident in the region @xmath149 ; this has relative weight @xmath150 and in the simple approximation considered here has the same functional form ( and physical origin ) as the dashed curve shown in fig .",
    "3 .. the threshold of inelastic scattering at @xmath151 is evident as is the restoration of the full scattering at @xmath152 .",
    "the absorbtion at @xmath153 is at first sight surprising because it comes from freely propagating quasiparticles which normally can not lead to finite frequency absorbtion in a translationally invariant system .",
    "such absorbtion can be easily understood if the interplane phase coherence is destroyed by the thermal fluctuations . in this case",
    "we may think of each plane as having a separate phase , so that translation invariance is effectively broken . in the @xmath4 case of present interest , however , one deals with the ground state of a quantum system which has a translation invariance .",
    "the explanation in this case is that @xmath4 interplane fluctuations imply the existence of an interplane charging energy ; the presence of this term in the hamiltonian means that the current carried by the quasiparticles does not commute with the hamiltonian and this allows the @xmath154 absorption to exist .    *",

    "we distinguished three cases : ( i ) no pairing(i.e . @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) ; ( ii ) conventional ( no fluctuations ) superconductivity ( i.e. @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) ; ( iii ) superconductivity with strong phase fluctuations ( i.e. @xmath166 and @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) . cases ( i ) and ( ii ) were found to have the same total spectral weight but going from case ( ii ) to case ( iii ) by keeping the gap the same but increasing the phase fluctuations ( i.e. decreasing @xmath111 ) was shown to decrease the total spectral weight .",

    "of course , this is less than the total missing weight(indeed is about half ) because @xmath76 is suppressed over the wider range @xmath192 .    for @xmath131,weight",
    "is conserved as @xmath32 is varied , so the increase in @xmath161 is compensated by a decrease in the @xmath193 conductivity .",
    "we see however from the normal state calculation shown in fig 2 that as @xmath32 is changed the difference in weight is spread out over a wide range of frequencies , of order @xmath61",
    ". if one integrates @xmath76 over a range small compared to @xmath61 the total weight ( @xmath161 plus @xmath193 part ) may appear to increase as @xmath32 is increased .",
    "by contrast , we find that if @xmath14 is varied at fixed @xmath32 . the change in conductivity is more concentrated at frequencies of the order of @xmath14 and weight is to a reasonable approximation conserved even if one integrates only over a range of the order of a few @xmath14 , especially for @xmath194 .",
    "weight is not conserved if the debye - waller parameter @xmath111 is varied .",
    "varying @xmath111 changes the weight in the superfluid component , the weight in the non - zero - frequency component , and also the total weight . in our previous work @xcite we found ( as can be seen directly from eqs .",
    "[ delk],[rhos ] ) that increasing @xmath111 while keeping other parameters fixed increases the weight in the c - axis superfluid response by twice as much as the total spectral weight increase .",
    "the physics is that as @xmath111 is increased , coherence factor effects become more important , leading to a decrease in @xmath18 in the region @xmath195 ; this decrease reduces the non - zero frequency spectral weight @xmath196 by an amount which turns out to be half of the increase in @xmath161 .",
    "we are most intersted in applying this result to underdoped cuprates , in which the superconducting gap is well formed for temperatures of the order of the resistive @xmath0 and the onset of superconductivity leads to an increase in @xmath111 from 0 to some non - zero value .",
    "however , as we have seen , there is evidence that the onset of superconductivity leads also to a change in @xmath32 ; therefore further consideration is necessary .",
    "further consideration requires further assumptions .",
    "we focus on underdoped materials and assume that at temperatures slightly greater than @xmath0 the superconducting gap is well formed and much greater than @xmath3 , but that thermal phase fluctuations drive @xmath111 to @xmath197 .",
    "we further suppose that at @xmath35 the offset parameter @xmath198 .",
    "as @xmath115 long ranged phase coherence is established , so @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",

    "as shown in @xcite the ratio becomes equal to @xmath211 if @xmath212 , and could become greater than @xmath211 if the inequality were reversed .",
    "the physics of the ratio is most easily undestood from the limit @xmath213 , @xmath201 and @xmath214 . in this case",
    "turning on an @xmath215 strongly suppresses the conductivity in the region @xmath15 but the small value of @xmath111 means the compensating increase in @xmath161 is negligible .",
    "the values @xmath216 and @xmath202 inferred from photoemission @xcite lead to @xmath217 , i.e. to a substantial reduction of the ratio from @xmath211 if @xmath218 or less .",
    "care is needed in applying eq .",
    "[ change ] to data . as is clear from fig .",
    "3 , variations in @xmath32 lead to variations in @xmath76 over a wide energy range , of order the basic scattering rate @xmath61 .",
    "an integration over a smaller range could miss some contributions to @xmath203 , leading to a larger apparent value of the ratio .",
    "we begin by summarizing the results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "we used second order perturbation theory in the interplane coupling to study the interplane conductivity , with particular emphasis on the effect of phase fluctuations in the presence of a pairing gap @xmath14 .",
    "we found that the formal consequence of the existence of phase fluctuations is a debye - waller factor @xmath194 which multiplies the anomalous ( f ) propagators .",
    "the physical consequences include a decrease in the total f - sum - rule oscillator strength , a decrease in the superfluid stiffness @xmath161 and a change in the form of the conductivity at frequencies of the order of twice the superconducting gap .",
    "another important parameter is @xmath32 which is defined in eq .",
    "[ z ] and parametrizes the frequency scale associated with the mechanism by which electrons are scattered .    as already noted in @xcite the most important and model - independent result of this analysis is that the fundamental measure of the strength of quantum fluctuations in the superconducting ground state is the ratio of @xmath161 to the area missing in @xmath219 as @xmath3 is decreased from above the temperature @xmath220 at which the superconducting ( or pseudo ) gap becomes visible to @xmath4 .",
    "a @xmath4 @xmath161 which is smaller than the missing area implies non - negligible quantum fluctuations .",
    "we further found that if quantum fluctuations are strong , the value of the c - axis conductivity in the region @xmath221 is increased above the predictions of bcs theory . if the quasiparticles with @xmath15 are weakly damped ( as indicated by photoemision experiments @xcite ) this increase takes the form of a peak .    finally , we derived a relation between @xmath161 and the area @xmath203 lost between @xmath222 and @xmath4 from the @xmath193 @xmath76 . in the usual bcs theory , where the gap closes at @xmath0 , @xmath223 .",
    "if ( as is believed to be the case in underdoped curpates ) a pairing gap exists exists in a wide temperature regime above @xmath0 and the resistive transition signals only the onset of phase coherence , then the ratio of @xmath161 to the weight @xmath203 lost below @xmath0 is different from 1 and as seen from eq .",
    "[ change ] depends on both the strength of the quantum fluctuations and the variation with temperature of the offset parameter @xmath32 . if @xmath32 is @xmath3-independent , then the ratio is @xmath211 independent of @xmath111 , whereas if @xmath32 increases as @xmath3 is decreased below @xmath0 the ratio is less than 2 , and if quantum fluctuations are sufficiently strong can be less even than @xmath224 . for the values",
    "@xmath225 and @xmath226 inferred from photoemission data @xcite the ratio would become @xmath224 at @xmath227 .",
    "the c - axis optics therefore contains information about the t - dependence of the electron scattering mechanism . however , to obtain this information one must integrate the conductivity over a wide range because we found changes in @xmath32 led to changes in @xmath76 which extended over a range of order the basic scattering rate @xmath61 .",
    "our results were obtained using second order perturbation theory in the interplane hopping .",
    "this perturbation theory has been used by many workers @xcite , and in the present model may be tested .",
    "the theoretical expansion parameter is @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is an in - plane density of states , @xmath84 is an average of the hopping over the fermi surface , and @xmath61 is the scattering rate .",
    "the band structure estimates @xmath230 , @xmath231 ( for ybco ; smaller for others ) and @xmath232 @xcite lead to @xmath233 ; the @xmath61 inferred from the high frequency data on @xmath234 @xcite then suggests that perturbation theory is very good .",
    "one may make a more experimental estimate by writing ( with units restored ) our theoretical result for the c - axis dc conductivity @xmath235 .",
    "here @xmath236 is the mean interplane spacing and @xmath237 is the in - plane lattice constant .",
    "the observed @xmath238 for optimally doped ybco then implies @xmath239 , reasonably consistent with the above estimates and justifiying the use of second order perturbation theory . for other materials",
    "the interplane conductivity is even smaller , so the perturbation theory should be even better .",
    "our results also rely crucially on the assumption that the part of the hamiltonian involving motion of electrons between planes has the form given in eq .",
    "[ h ] , i.e. is the usual band - theory form which involves hopping of a real electron in a manner which conserves in - plane momentum .",
    "strong scattering the barrier region ( i.e. non - momentum - conserving hopping ) @xcite or occupation modulated hopping @xcite would invalidate our results .",
    "we will argue below that the close correspondence between our results and data suggests that the usual band theory form of the hopping is the correct one .",
    "we turn now to the data , beginning with the temperature and doping dependence of the spectral weight . in overdoped materials a small increase in low-@xmath69 normal - state spectral weight occurs as @xmath3 is decreased below room temperature ( see , e.g. fig .",
    "3a of @xcite ) .",
    "our results ( c.f . fig .",
    "2 ) suggest that this may be compensated by a small decrease in conductivity over a wide frequency range .",
    "in optimally doped materials spectral weight seems to be conserved as a function of temperature . in optimally doped and overdoped materials",
    "the superconducting gap closes at @xmath0 and spectral weight in @xmath161 compensates for the area lost below @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "further , in optimally doped and overdoped materials the conductivity in the superconducting state appears to have the usual bcs form , rising smoothly from the gap edge and being always less than the normal state @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this is consisent with our results if in these materials quantum and thermal fluctuations of the order parameter are negligible .",
    "the observed @xmath22 for optimally doped and overdoped materials provides evidence against the alternative explanation of the @xmath240-axis conductivity advanced in @xcite . in these works , the weak frequency dependence of @xmath22 at @xmath35",
    "is attributed to a strongly momentum non - conserving interplane coupling @xmath241 , due physically to strong scattering in the interplane barrier layers , rather than to a large value of an in - plane electron scattering rate @xmath61 .",
    "this view implies that @xmath240-axis conductivity is equivalent to a point contact tunneling ; if it were correct then at @xmath242 one would expect to observe peaks in @xmath22 at @xmath243 , corresponding to the sharp peaks observed in photoemission and in @xmath240-axis tunneling @xcite .",
    "further , the momentum mixing caused by this scattering would decrease @xmath161 below the bcs missing area value , as noted by kim @xcite .",
    "we therefore believe the assumption that the tunnelling matrix element always conserves momentum , and that the changes in conductivity with doping are due to changes in the underlying physics of the @xmath2 planes , is correct .",
    "the data are also inconsistent with the model of @xcite which for optimally doped materials would predict a @xmath244 greater than the area missing below @xmath0 .",
    "we now consider the evolution of the spectral weight as the doping is decreased .",
    "underdoped materials exhibit a normal state pseudogap , which begins to be visible as the temperature is decreased below a temperature @xmath220 , which increases with decreasing doping .",
    "spectral weight appears to be independent of @xmath3 at @xmath245 , with one exception : in @xmath246 , @xmath247 appears to have a strong temperature dependence at all measured frequencies between room temperature and low @xmath248 .",
    "this behavior may be due to the lo - to structural phase transition , which will change the numerical value of the interplane coupling .",
    "in any event , this nonconservation of weight over a wide scale seems to be peculiar to the @xmath246 materials and not to be related to superconductivity .",
    "as the temperature is reduced below @xmath220 the onset of the pseudogap causes a decrease in total spectral weight @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is further reduced below @xmath0 the weight ( including both @xmath161 and @xmath249 ) increases again , but the @xmath4 weight is never greater than the @xmath250 weight .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our results if the pseudogap is the superconducting pairing gap , and @xmath0 corresponds to the onset of phase coherence . by contrast , if the pseudogap were caused by a charge or spin density wave fluctuation , then the methods we have used here would predict that weight would be conserved even in the @xmath251 fluctuation regime : weight lost at low frequencies due to the opening of the gap would be shifted for frequencies just above @xmath252 .",
    "thus we believe the c - axis optical data provides strong support to the hypothesis that the pseudogap is due to superconducting pairing without phase coherence @xcite .",
    "we note also that the model of @xcite did not consider the pseudogap regime explicitly , but the results seem to imply a @xmath244 greater than the weight lost below @xmath220 , again in contradiction to the data",
    ".    in underdoped @xmath253 , @xmath161 at @xmath4 is less than the area lost below @xmath220 @xcite , implying strong quantum fluctuations ; in other materials there is as yet no evidence for strong quantum fluctuations . in @xmath254",
    "the evidence suggests @xmath161 equals the area lost below @xmath220 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath161 to the change in @xmath193 spectral weight between @xmath255 and @xmath115 appears qualitatively consistent with the results presented here . in optimally doped and overdoped materials the gap closing coincides with @xmath0 and the expected ratio of @xmath224",
    "is apparently observed @xcite . as the doping",
    "is decreased and the pseudogap becomes more apparent , the measured ratio grows .",
    "a number of underdoped materials appear to exhibit a ratio of 2 @xcite , while a very recent measurement @xcite finds a ratio of @xmath256 in a slightly underdoped bscco sample .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the effects of the t - dependent offset are visible in the spectral weight .",
    "an experimental study of the interrelationship of @xmath257 ( as defined by the ratio of the observed @xmath161 to the area missing below @xmath220 ) , the t - dependent offset ( from photoemission ) and the ratio of @xmath161 to the area missing below @xmath0 would be very valuable .",

    "the effects discussed here seem clearly to be visible in the @xmath258 presented in fig . 3 of tajima _ et",
    "al _ @xcite , although it should be noted that there are large uncertainties in the experimental determination of the electronic contribution to @xmath22 because the observed conductivity is dominated by phonon lines which must be subtracted out . also the ybco family of materials studied by tajima et .",

    "additionally the ybco materials have a bilayer structure which may allow other excitations , including in particular optical josephson plasmons @xcite .",
    "further study of systems without chains and of single - plane systems is needed .",
    "consider first the optimally doped sample ( fig .",
    "3b of ref @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath35 conductivity is small and has negligible frequency and temperature dependence , consistent with a large , quasistatic t - independent scattering rate @xmath61 .",

    "we believe ( _ c.f . _ fig .",
    "4 ) that these data are consistent with a maximum gap value @xmath261 and an offset @xmath262 .",
    "the presence of absorption at the lowest measured frequencies and the rounded shape of @xmath18 are presumably due to a combination of defects and the fact that in real materials @xmath22 is determined by an average over the fermi surface of an angle dependent energy gap and an angle dependent c - axis hopping : @xmath263 ( of course , additional contributions from chain states are also possible ) .",
    "the observed @xmath161 is found to compensate for the missing area. thus , in optimally doped @xmath264 the @xmath3-dependence of the total spectral weight , of @xmath161 and of the @xmath69 and @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath76 are consistent with the behavior expected for a bcs superconductor with negligible quantum fluctuations at low @xmath3 and a negligible pseudogap above @xmath265 .    as the doping level is decreased , the behavior changes . as seen in figs 3c and 3d of @xcite , a pseudogap ( suppression of the absorption at @xmath266 ) is visible for a range of temperatures @xmath35 .",
    "the rise of the conductivity at the pseudogap edge seems rather abrupt , as expected from the results shown in fig .",
    "2 . the total spectral weight ( superfluid part plus contribution from @xmath204 )",
    "is less than the room temperature spectral weight .",
    "next , a peak appears in @xmath76 at @xmath267 ; the peak is stronger in the @xmath268 sample than in the @xmath269 one , but the position does not shift .",
    "finally , there is a hint of the minimum at @xmath270 in the @xmath271 sample .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical curves shown in fig .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that as doping is decreased , quantum fluctuations increase ; this is shown by the analysis of the optical weight presented in our previous paper and consistent with the analysis of the hall conductivity presented in @xcite .",
    "the larger peak in the @xmath272 material is consistent with the stronger quantum fluctuations expected there .",
    "the peak at @xmath273 and minimum at @xmath274 are expected from the @xmath275 structure of the self energy if the threshold scattering frequency @xmath32 is @xmath276 .",
    "finally , we note that in the @xmath277 material the spectral weight in the peak is about @xmath278 of the spectral weight lost below @xmath19 in superconducting state as expected if the quantum fluctuations are very strong .",
    "the theory predicts an anticorrelation of the weight in the peak and in @xmath279 . to make the comparison quantitative one should measure both in units of the weght lost below @xmath33 .",
    "the data needed to make this comparison are not available at present .    as noted above , an alternative interpretation of the peak as",
    "a bilayer plasmon has been presented @xcite . in support of our interpretation",
    "we note that the strength of the feature seems correlated with the strength of quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , our results imply that the peak should be visible in single - layer materials where to date no peak has been reported .",
    "indeed , in high-@xmath0 materials apart from @xmath253 no clear peak has been observed in @xmath22 below @xmath0 ( except , perhaps in @xmath254 where a slight hint of a peak is visible ) .",
    "the absence of a strong peak in this material is consistent with the observation that the optical spectral weight is the same at room temperature as it is at @xmath4 , implying quantum fluctuations are weak in @xmath254 .",
    "further experimental investigation of these issues would be very helpful .",
    "in this paper we have shown how quantum and thermal fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter affect the integrated spectral weight and frequency dependence of the interplane conductivity .",
    "we showed that the data are consistent with the notion that the normal state pseudogap is due to superconducting pairing without long range phase coherence , and imply that in very underdoped materials , quantum fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter are strong .",
    "no further assumptions are required to account for the data .",
    "in particular , while the increase in spectral weight observed below @xmath0 in underdoped materials may be interpreted as a change in c - axis kinetic energy on entering the superconducting state @xcite , this increase was shown to be a simple consequence of the hypothesis mentioned above , and therefore provides little additional insight into the microscopics of the normal and superconducting states of high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "the crucial microscopic information which can be extracted from @xmath22 involves the mechanism by which electrons are scattered within a single @xmath2 plane .",
    "we have argued above , following anderson @xcite , that the c - axis conductivity is in effect a spectroscopy of the in - plane green function and implies that at least for momenta near the @xmath121 points which dominte the c - axis conductivity the in - plane green function is characterized by a self energy which is large , imaginary and only weakly frequency dependent , i.e by a large frequency independent scattering rate .",
    "the physical origin of the scattering is not at present understood .",
    "one possibility , adopted by many workers @xcite is that the scattering rate may be thought of in a relatively conventional way , as the scattering of a usual electron off of some fluctuation .",
    "an alternative view , propounded by anderson @xcite is that the c - axis conductivity reflects a fundamentally unconventional ( non - fermi - liquid ) physics of the @xmath2 planes , which have reasonably well defined excitations which however have very small overlap with the conventional electron .    in this paper we studied in detail the consequences of the more conventional picture , because it is well enough defined to allow detailed calculation . because our results depend mainly on the shape of the electron spectral function near the @xmath12 points , it seems likely they would follow from a non - fermi - liquid picture also .    within the conventional picture ,",
    "at least , it is natural to assume that if the superconducting order parameter exhibits strong quantum fluctuations then electron - electron interactions are strong generally and therefore make an important contribution to the scattering rate .",
    "if this is the case , then it seems reasonable that this scattering will be affected by the onset of superconductivity , and specifically that the low frequency part of it will be suppressed @xcite .",
    "the hypothesized suppression of the scattering rate seems to have been confirmed for high-@xmath0 materials by photoemission data .",
    "the data are however inconsistent with theoretical expectation in a manner which deserves further discussion and investigation .",
    "the argument for the suppression was this @xcite : electron - electron scattering involves the creation of a particle - hole pair .",
    "in the superconducting state the density of states of these pairs is reduced for energies less than @xmath19 ; hence in the range @xmath280 one would have weakly scattered quasiparticles . in fact , photoemission @xcite suggests that the range of weak scattering is @xmath281 with @xmath262 not @xmath33 .",
    "norman et .",
    "@xcite , from a phenomenological point of view , and chubukov and morr @xcite , from a calculation of a model of electrons coupled to spin fluctuations , explained this as a strong coupling effect : electrons do not scatter of a pair , but off of a collective mode of some kind . in the gapped state ,",
    "what amount to excitonic effects reduce the final state energy below the naive @xmath33 threshold .    in order to produce the observed effects",
    ", the coupling of electrons to the mode must be very strong , and in the normal state the spectral weight in the mode must be concentrated at @xmath135 .",
    "this is already somewhat unusual , but the data exhibit a further anomalous feature . in underdoped materials",
    "the gap appears at a high temperature @xmath282 while phase coherence appears at the much lower resistive superconducting transition temperature @xmath283 . _",
    "the appearance of the scattering rate offset , @xmath32 , seems to be tied to the onset of phase coherence , and not to the opening of the gap_. this feature is not expected from the arguments given above , and is not understood at present .",
    "we have shown that , within the conventional picture at least , the t - dependent offset leads to two effects in @xmath22 : the appearance of a peak at @xmath221 , if quantum fluctuations are strong , and a decrease in the ratio between @xmath161 and the change between @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the @xmath193 pectral weight .",
    "the experimental status of these two effects is unclear ; further studies would be valuable .    on the theoretical side , two possible avenues of investigation present themselves .",
    "one is that the mode which scatters electrons is the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this idea was advanced by geshkenbein et .",
    "@xcite and has been adopted by us and by others @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the more or less conventional physical picture of usual electrons strongly scattered by some bosonic mode is simply inadequate , and that the explanation should be sought in the physics of an underlying non - fermi - liquid state which becomes more conventional when long ranged phase coherence is established .",
    "this idea has been advanced by p. w. anderson @xcite and receives at least qualitative support from the slave - boson gauge theory approach to the t - j model @xcite , where establishment of phase coherence is related to the restoration of more fermi - liquid - like behavior .    in our opinion , understanding the physics of the very large scattering is one of the key problems in high-@xmath0 superconductivity . in this paper",
