    "fascinating insights into the formation of atomic chains consisting only of a few atoms suspended between two electrodes have been obtained by transmission electron microscopy and mechanically controllable break junction techniques.@xcite these experiments triggered the imagination of scientists to use such atomic - scale junctions as future electronic devices by exploiting their unique properties , e.g.  ballistic electronic transport.@xcite due to their reduced dimensions , atomic chains have also been predicted to develop magnetic moments even for elements nonmagnetic in bulk such as ir , pt , or pd.@xcite recently , an indirect proof has been given that transition - metal chains in break junctions are in general magnetic.@xcite mastering the intriguing magnetic properties of suspended chains would enable spintronic applications based on the unique possibility to probe , control and switch the magnetic states by spin - polarized currents.@xcite    the orientation of the magnetic moments is stabilized against thermal fluctuations by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) arising from spin - orbit coupling .",

    "it significantly quenches the central atom s mae , so that the resulting total anisotropy is on average smaller than anticipated from the infinite mw both for ir and pt .",

    "5(c ) ) , which will inevitably result in large changes of the experimentally measured conductance .",
    "as far as the @xmath0 tms are concerned , giant values of the ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance should be achievable due to strong spin - orbit coupling in these metals , which is able to modify the electronic structure significantly in response to the changes of the magnetization direction in real space .",

    "ab initio _ calculations of suspended trimers of w , ir and pt including structural relaxations as a function of the separation between the leads , we demonstrate that the chain atoms develop significant spin moments upon stretching .",
    "we investigate the stability of these spin moments via evaluating the magnetic anisotropy energy of the trimers .",
    "our calculations reveal large mae of the whole trimers of the order of 10 to 30 mev per atom .",

    "we argue that this effect is general and can occur in suspended chains of different elements and different length , leading to non - trivial real space textures of magnetic anisotropy energy which might even lead to complex magnetic ordering in atomic - scale junctions .    under the condition of large predicted values of mae huge magnetic fields would be required to change the magnetization of the chains , therefore , new ways to achieve this goal have to be established . one of the possibilities lies in using the ability to control the magnetization direction in the junction by changing the distance between the leads .",
    "we show that such switches of the magnetization can happen and will result in strong features in the measured conductance .",
    "distinguishing these features from the changes in conductance due to chain elongation or atomic rearrangements presents a considerable challenge .",

    "<S> using first - principles calculations , we study the magnetism of @xmath0 transition - metal atomic junctions including structural relaxations and spin - orbit coupling . upon stretching monatomic chains of w , ir , and pt suspended between two leads , we find the development of strong magnetism and large values of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) of up to 30  mev  per chain atom . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that switches of the easy magnetization axis of the nanocontacts upon elongation should be observable by ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements . due to the different local symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the contributions to the mae of the central chain atoms and chain atoms in the vicinity of the leads can have opposite signs which reduces the total mae . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this effect occurs independent of the chain length or geometry of the electrodes . </S>"
