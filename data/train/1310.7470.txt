    "graphene remains one of the most studied materials since the experimental isolation of its two - dimensional honeycomb lattice from graphite.@xcite the singular properties of graphene have attracted such an interest , from fundamental and application points of view , that nowadays an extensive literature exists on different physical phenomena occurring in this material . @xcite the honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms in graphene provides two relevant ingredients to electronic transport : a sublattice ( chiral ) symmetry and a linear dispersion relation .",
    "the latter , valid at low energies,@xcite has attracted a lot of attention since it allows an analogy with relativistic massless particles described by the dirac equation . however , the sublattice symmetry is perhaps a feature of more fundamental importance .",
    "the lattice structure of graphene is described by two identical interconnected sublattices , such that the sites of one sublattice are connected only to the sites of the other one , i.e. , the lattice of graphene is bipartite resulting in a symmetric energy spectrum around the fermi energy .",
    "the sublattice symmetry , also known as chiral symmetry , has deep consequences on different electronic properties , as has been shown in the past , @xcite although , there is a revived interest in the context of superconducting quasiparticles , topological insulators , and superconductors .",
    "@xcite    electronic properties of pristine graphene structures have been extensively studied . however",
    ", real graphene - based devices can be affected by the presence of disorder , as any other mesoscopic material .",
    "different sources of disorder can be found in graphene .",
    "for instance , distortion of the lattice like ripples can appear by interactions with the substrate .",
    "@xcite experiments have been performed using suspended graphene structures to avoid effects of the substrate , @xcite but even in this case graphene samples are not free of defects .",
    "also , experimental evidence of short range disorder in graphene has been found in refs . .",
    "despite the fact that disorder is generally considered as an ingredient to be avoided , one might take advantage of it .",
    "for instance , electronic properties of graphene can be manipulated by doping a sample or by replacing carbon atoms .",
    "@xcite    disorder plays a central role in the problem of quantum transport and therefore its effects have been widely studied . for instance , it is known that in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , the presence of any small amount of disorder leads to exponential localization of electron wavefunctions ( anderson localization ) with the distance @xmath0 : @xmath1 .",
    "this exponential decay has been experimentally and theoretically studied in different disordered systems.@xcite the inverse of the localization length @xmath2 is of fundamental importance for the description of statistical properties of transport within the scaling approach to localization.@xcite however , electron wavefunctions are not always exponentially ( anderson ) localized ; it has been shown that the wavefunction decays as @xmath3 at the band center of 1d systems with random hopping between neighboring lattice sites ( off - diagonal disorder ) , i.e. , electrons are less localized ( delocalized ) than in the standard anderson problem.@xcite    several models have been used to describe different effects of disorder in graphene .",
    "the literature is very extensive and we turn the attention of the reader to ref . for a review of the topic",
    "( see also refs . ) .",
    "for example , effective hamiltonians ( dirac hamiltonians ) valid in the continuum low - energy limit and tight - binding models have been introduced to study statistical properties of conductance fluctuations , such as the density of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "most of the theoretical works , however , deal with effects produced by the standard anderson - localization of electrons .    for finite - size graphene structures like nanoribbons , an additional element has to be considered in the study of quantum transport , namely , the sample terminations or edges .",
    "there are two different basic graphene edges : zigzag and armchair , which affect the electronic properties of nanoribbons .",
    "for example , the band structure is completely different for each termination ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "also , the existence of edge states in clean zigzag nanoribbons has been shown , @xcite whereas in armchair nanoribbons those states are absent .",
    "detailed experimental investigations on the effects of graphene edges on quantum transport have been restricted by technological limitations on controlling the edge of graphene samples .",
    "nowadays a precise manipulation of graphene terminations is still a challenge , but recent experiments have shown a high control of the nanoribbon edges.@xcite in fact , transport experiments have been performed with an accurate control of the nanoribbon terminations .",
    "@xcite    therefore , understanding the role of the edge morphology in nanoribbons as well as the effects of disorder in graphene - based devices is of interest from a fundamental point of view and relevant to future experimental investigations .    in this work",
    ", the effects of both disorder and edges on the conductance fluctuations of graphene nanoribbons are studied .",
    "we calculate the conductance distribution of disordered zigzag and armchair graphene nanoribbons . as we show below , electronic transport in zigzag nanoribbons",
    "takes place via standard exponentially localized states ( anderson localization ) , which allows us to study the conductance statistics within a conventional approach to localization . for armchair nanoribbons ,",
    "however , electrons are delocalized and we require an extension of the standard localization approach .",
    "thus , the conductance statistics is affected significatively by the nanoribbon edges .",
    "concerning the numerical results , we use a standard tight - binding hamiltonian model to describe the armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nearest neighbors and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for spinless fermions .",
    "disorder is introduced via random hopping elements @xmath9 connecting the two sublattices .",
    "this type of short - range disorder models the presence of distortions in graphene samples and preserves the symmetry of the graphene lattice .",

    "the conductance @xmath20 ( in units of the conductance quantum @xmath21 ) is calculated by attaching perfect metallic graphene leads to the left and right side of the disordered ribbons ( top panels in fig .",

    "[ figure_2 ] ( a ) we show the modulus squared of the wavefunction for one realization of the disorder ; we can see that the wavefunction is located on the border slightly penetrating the ribbon . in the anderson localization problem",

    "we observe from the band structure in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] ( bottom - right ) that only one channel contributes to the transport near the fermi energy , as in the case of zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "now , however , anomalous localization of electrons takes place .",
    "a signature of such delocalization is the nonlinear dependence of @xmath26 versus the length @xmath15 .",
    "we illustrate this behavior in our armchair nanoribbons in fig .",
    "[ figure_3](a ) , where a power - law dependence of @xmath26 with @xmath15 is shown .",
    "one might contrast this result with the linear dependence of @xmath26 with @xmath15 for zigzag nanoribbons [ fig .",
    "[ figure_2](b ) ] .",

    "physically , @xmath43 might be considered a measure of the strength of the electron localization : the localization becomes weaker as @xmath43 decreases . with the above information , the conductance distribution @xmath45 can be obtained from @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 .",

    "[ figure_3 ] we have extracted the value of @xmath54 .",
    "this value does not depend on the length , width , and degree of disorder , according to our numerical simulations ; in this sense it is universal for graphene nanoribbons with off - diagonal disorder , at the band center.@xcite thus , in figs .",

    "[ figure_3](d ) the distributions for both edge terminations with the same conductance average @xmath59 .",

    "we have studied the quantum conductance fluctuations of disordered zigzag and armchair nanoribbons . for both ribbon edges ,",
    "we provide analytical expressions of the conductance distributions which are determined by the average @xmath26 and the exponent @xmath43 of its power - law decay with the system length . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no other theoretical framework that provides the complete conductance distribution . without free parameters , the theoretical predictions",
    "have been confirmed by numerical simulations of graphene nanoribbons .",
    "the simulations have been performed using a tight - binding model with random hopping elements which preserves the chiral symmetry on the graphene lattice .",
    "our results show significant differences between the conductance statistics of armchair and zigzag nanoribbons . essentially , this is a consequence of the different way that electrons become localized in each type of nanoribbon .",
    "we have found that electrons in zigzag ribbons are more localized than in armchair ribbons : while in zigzag nanoribbons electrons are exponentially localized , as in the standard anderson localization , in armchair nanoribbons electrons are anomalously localized ( delocalized ) . the strength of delocalization ( measured by @xmath43 ) does not depend on the length , width , or disorder degree of the armchair ribbon , it rather being fundamentally an effect of the chirality of the honeycomb lattice . electronic transport in zigzag nanoribbons takes place via states located at the border of the ribbons which correspond to a flat band at low energies ( fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] bottom left ) . we have shown that under the presence of disorder , those edge states become exponentially localized .",
    "in contrast , electrons in armchair nanoribbons follow a linear dispersion relation ( fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] , bottom right ) , as in other disordered systems that exhibit delocalization effects ( e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "we remark that our model is valid for 1d systems ( one channel ) while nanoribbons are 2d structures . the metallic bands ( fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] ) show that transport occurs effectively through one single channel , near the fermi energy . on the other hand ,",
    "first - principle calculations have shown that band structures of armchair and zigzag nanoribbons always have an energy gap.@xcite the band structures , however , become similar to those considered here for slightly wider nanoribbons , near the band gap .",
    "we thus expect to observe similar localization / delocalization effects to those studied here .",
    "concerning the experimental observability of our results , we point out that the effects of delocalization on the conductance statistics depend on the conservation of the chiral symmetry of the graphene sublattices .",
    "chiral symmetry can be broken by different sources ; for instance , by the presence of lattice deformations like the so - called stone - wales defects,@xcite which lead to the formation of pentagons and heptagons on the honeycomb lattice of graphene . the presence of this kind of defect in armchair ribbons might prevent delocalization of electrons , but delocalization effects would be gradually washed out as the number of those defects are increased and , eventually , standard anderson localization would take place .",
    "another issue is the effect of coulomb interactions,@xcite which we have neglected .",
    "coulomb interactions break the chiral symmetry while they become more important in suspended graphene samples , since no substrate can screen the electromagnetic fields .",
    "recent calculations , however , have shown the restoration of the chiral symmetry by lattice distortions , like the so - called kekul distortion.@xcite    to conclude , we have assumed well defined nanoribbon edges , zigzag or armchair , which highlights the relevance of edges to electronic transport .",
    "nanoribbons with mixed edges can be analyzed within our framework ; in this case , we expect to observe intermediate conductance fluctuations between those studied here . nonetheless , the observability of our findings depends on the control of the nanoribbon edges .",
    "recent advances @xcite indicate that in the near future experiments will be performed allowing full control of the nanoribbon terminations .",
    "thus , we hope that our results motivate further experimental investigations and lead to a better understanding of the central role that disorder and symmetries play on quantum electronic transport through graphene nanoribbons .",
