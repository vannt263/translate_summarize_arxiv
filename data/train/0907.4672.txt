    "entropy quantifies the uncertainty about the state of a physical system .",
    "a bipartite system in a pure state has zero entropy , but the reduced state of one subsystem may have positive entropy .",
    "this is due to quantum correlations between the two subsystems , the entanglement .",
    "in fact , this entropy quantifies the entanglement in the sense of quantum information theory @xcite .    in classical physics ,",
    "the entropy of a region inside a spatially - extended system at finite temperature is proportional to the volume of the region ",
    "entropy is an extensive quantity . at zero temperature , it is small and independent of the region . in quantum physics , at finite temperature , the entropy of a region is also proportional to the volume .",
    "but it has been observed in several models that , at zero temperature , the entropy of a region is proportional to its surface area @xcite . in some models of critical free fermions",
    "the entropy scales as the area times the logarithm of the volume @xcite .",
    "this has been presented as a violation of the area law , although the dimensionality of the scaling is still that of the area .",
    "a celebrated proof shows that any one - dimensional system with finite - range interactions and an energy gap above the ground state obeys a strict area law @xcite .",
    "the original motivation for this problem is the analogy with black - hole physics , where the thermodynamic entropy is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon @xcite .",
    "the second motivation is to guide the development of efficient methods for simulating quantum systems with classical computers .",
    "the number of parameters needed for specifying an arbitrary pure state of an @xmath0-partite system is exponential in @xmath0 .",
    "if the state is not entangled , the number of parameters is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "hence , there seems to be a correspondence between entanglement and complexity . in one spatial dimension ,",
    "the relation between entropy and the complexity of simulating a system is well understood @xcite . the third motivation is to understand the kind of states that arise in quantum many - body systems with strong interactions .",
    "almost all states in the hilbert space obey a volume law for the entropy @xcite .",
    "hence , area laws tell a lot about the multipartite entanglement structure . at a finer level ,",
    "the specific form of an area law tells additional information about the system : the logarithmic correction is a signature of criticality @xcite ; and the appearance of a negative constant is a signature of topological order @xcite . for further overview of the topics around area laws",

    "this provides a characterization for the approximate support of the global ground state inside the region @xmath6 . in section v a condition on the density of states is assumed : if @xmath11 is the subhamiltonian with all terms of @xmath1 whose support is fully contained in @xmath3 , then the number of eigenvalues lower than @xmath12 is bounded by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lowest eigenvalue and @xmath15 some constants independent of @xmath3 .",
