    "changes the groundstates by a non - trivial phase factor , whereas interchanging two non - abelian quasiparticles rotates the groundstates within a set of degenerated groundstate manifold and the final state will depend on the order of operations being carried out .",
    "since the quasipartices have unique characterization to a given topological order , it is possible to identify a topological ordered state through the properties of quasiparticles . in particular , compared to the abelian quasipartcles , the non - abelian quasiparticles are fundamentally important for our understanding of the emerging physics , which also have potential application for the fault - tolerant topological quantum computation @xcite .",

    "<S> identifying and understanding interacting systems that can host non - abelian topological phases with fractionalized quasi - particles have attracted intense attention in the past twenty years . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , it is possible to realize a rich variety of such states by coupling two abelian fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states together through gapping out part of the low energy degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> so far , there are some indications , but no robust examples have been established in bilayer systems for realizing the non - abelian state in the past . here , we present a phase diagram of a double - layer bosonic fqh system based on the exact diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations , which demonstrates a potential regime with the emergence of the non - abelian bosonic moore - read state . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the abelian phase with four fold topological degeneracy at weak coupling , with the increase of interlayer tunneling , we find an intermediate regime with a three - fold groundstate degeneracy and a finite drag hall conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we find different topological sectors in consistent with moore - read state by inserting different fluxes in adiabatic dmrg study . </S>",
    "<S> we also extract the modular @xmath0 matrix , which supports the emergence of the non - abelian ising anyon quasiparticle in this system . </S>"
