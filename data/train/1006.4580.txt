    "organic semiconductors are extremely promising materials for spintronics thanks to their long spin coherence times . however , spin phenomena in these materials are not yet fully understood , partly due to the lack of suitable characterisation techniques , since those tuned for inorganic semiconductors are not always successful for organic materials @xcite .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) has been proven to be an applicable probe in this field , as it is sensitive to spin dynamics in organic semiconductors on a molecular lengthscale @xcite . in organic semiconductors",
    "the implanted muons form a hydrogen - like system , called muonium , by capturing an electron . in muonium",
    "the muon and electron spins are coupled through hyperfine interaction . as a consequence relaxation on the electron spin",
    "can induce changes in the muon spin , which can be detected . here",
    "we show how muon spin relaxation and in particular the avoided level crossing ( alc ) technique can be used to probe the electron spin dynamics in organic semiconductors .",
    "muon spin relaxation is an experimental technique using positive muons as microscopic spin probe .",
    "positive muon has a finite lifetime @xmath12.2 @xmath0s , and it radioactively decays emitting a positron and two neutrinos according to the process @xmath2 .",
    "the positron is emitted preferentially in the direction of the muon s spin at the time of the decay , due to parity violation in weak interaction @xcite . as a consequence measuring the time dependence of the emission direction of the positron provides information on the time evolution of the muon spin .",
    "+ in @xmath0sr experiments 100% spin polarised muons are implanted in the sample .",
    "once implanted in semiconductors the muon gives rise to a series of ionisation and scattering processes , through which its energy decreases from 4mev to a few kev .",
    "then it takes part in a series of electron capture and loss processes that reduce its energy further .",
    "finally it thermalises to form interstitial positive muon or it captures an electron and form a hydrogen - like species called muonium ( mu ) @xcite .",
    "thermalisation of muons is fast ( @xmath3ns ) compared to its lifetime",
    ". + if an external magnetic field is applied in the direction of the initial muon spin , as it is in so called `` longitudinal field '' experiments , the hamiltonian for muonium can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the muon and electron gyromagnetic ratios , b is the applied longitudinal field , i and s are the muon s and electron s spins and a is the hyperfine tensor @xcite .",
    "the energy levels as a function of the applied magnetic field that originates from this hamiltonian for an isotropic hyperfine interaction are shown in the breit - rabi digram in figure [ fig1](a ) .        at b=0 a singlet and a triplet",
    "are obtained , the degeneracy of the latter being lifted by the magnetic field . at high enough fields ( paschen - back regime , where most of the experiments are performed ) the electron and muon spins",
    "are decoupled and the state of the system can be described by products of pure zeeman states for the electron and muon .",
    "+ at a high field which depends on the value of the hyperfine coupling constant , two of the levels should cross , as can be observed in figure [ fig1](b ) ( dashed lines ) .",
    "however , if further interactions are present , as an example with the nuclei , this crossing can be avoided .",
    "in fact , for a hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 can be treated as a perturbation , the correction to the energies up to second order is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the n - th zero order energy and eigenstate and the denominator becomes tiny when the two unperturbed levels approach @xcite .",
    "the effect of this correction to the energy levels is to avoid the crossing ( see figure [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "close to this avoided level crossing the states are no longer pure zeeman states , but they are instead mixtures of states corresponding to different values of the muon magnetic quantum number . as a consequence a loss of polarisation of the muon can be observed @xcite .",
    "alcs can be classified by the change in total quantum number m. if the hyperfine interaction is isotropic , the most common kind of alc is the one with @xmath12m=0 , that corresponds to a muon - nuclear spin flip - flop .",
    "however in solids the most intense crossing is @xmath12m=1 , corresponding to a muon spin flip and is observed only when anisotropy in the interaction is present .",
    "@xmath12m=2 transitions exist , but they are usually very weak and narrow [ 3 ]",
    ". a simulated alc curve is shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( black line ) .",
    "as can be observed , the polarisation is plotted versus the applied magnetic field .",
    "the polarisation exhibits a deepening , representing the loss of polarisation around the alc field .",
    "the shape and position of this alc curve depends on the hyperfine coupling constants ( both isotropic and anisotropic ) .",
    "however , the presence of an electron spin relaxation rate ( esr ) also has an effect on the alc curve .",
    "alcs simulated using the same parameters with an increasing electron spin relaxation rate are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear that at low electron spin relaxation rates neither the position nor the shape of these alcs show substantial changes , but the amplitude enormously increases . + this",
    "can be modeled through a density matrix formalism , that is also used to simulate the experimental data and extract the esr .",
    "a density matrix is defined as @xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the muon , electron and mixed polarisations , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath17 is described by the equation @xmath18\\ ] ] from which the time dependent polarisations can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the general solution can only be determined numerically . if an electron spin relaxation mechanism is present in the system its effect can be taken into account phenomenologically by introducing extra terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the differential equations for the polarisations obtained from equation [ timeevrho ] @xcite :    @xmath21",
    "( trimethyl)silyl - pentacene ( tms - pentacene ) was synthesised according to a published procedure @xcite and was further purified by repeated recrystallisation from dichloromethano / ethanol .",
    "its structure is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the presence of the side groups on the central spine prevents the molecule to take the usual herringbone packing of pentacene ; as a consequence the molecules have a face - to - face packing that allows better @xmath22-orbitals overlap and consequently better charge carrier mobility @xcite .",
    "the measured sample was polycrystalline powder .",
    "+ muon experiments were performed at the hifi spectrometer at isis , rutherford appleton laboratory .",
    "about 250 mg of tms - pentacene was placed in an envelope ( 17 mm @xmath23 17 mm ) made of 25 @xmath0 m thick silver foil ( 99.99 % pure ) .",
    "another layer of silver foil was placed in front of the sample as a degrader , to assure that the muons stop in the sample . +",
    "the software wimda @xcite was used to extract the time - integrated data and plot them as a function of applied field .",
    "alcs were obtained in this way , and they were then modelled using the software quantum based on the density matrix formalism described in the previous section @xcite .",
    "the alc simulations presented in the following are performed considering a muon - electron system .",
    "no nuclei are taken into account as their influence was discovered to be negligible .",
    "monte - carlo simulations with powder averaging and 10000 iterations for each magnetic field was used .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the alcs measured for tms - pentacene at 3k , 150k and 300k .",
    "data were also acquired at 10k and 25k ( data not shown ) .",
    "alcs are observed around 0.28 t , corresponding to a hyperfine coupling of around 70mhz .",
    "the position and width of the alcs do not show a remarcable temperature depence , while the amplitude considerably increases on increasing the temperature . from the time - differential data and the field dependent relaxation rate ( data not shown , see ref @xcite ) this increased alc depth is clearly related to a higher relaxation rate of the muon spin .",
    "the measured alcs look as the superposition of three alcs very close to each other , the difference arising from slightly different possible bonding angles of the muon in the molecule . as a consequence",
    "three contributions were also considered in the modeling .",
    "their relative amplitude is determined from the 3k data , setting the esr to a very low value .",
    "this assumption is justified if the electron spin relaxation is driven by an effect strongly dependent on temperature , as a coupling to vibrations @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig4 ] ( black line).the obtained relative amplitudes are 0.17 , 0.24 and 0.59 .",
    "these parameters are used to scale the three contributions at higher temperatures .",
    "an esr different from zero is necessary in the model to account for the higher intensity of the alc at higher temperatures , whereas there is only a small change in the hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown as solid lines in figure [ fig4 ] .",

    "these small changes in the values of a , d1 and d2 , of the order of few percent , are likely to be due to changes in bond length at different temperatures . on the other hand",
