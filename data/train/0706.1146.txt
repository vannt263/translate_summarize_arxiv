    "general relativity ( gr ) is a comprehensive theory of spacetime , gravity and matter .",
    "its formulation implies that space and time are not `` absolute '' entities , as in classical mechanics , but dynamical quantities strictly related to the distribution of matter and energy . as a consequence ,",
    "this approach gave rise to a new conception of the universe itself which , for the first time , was considered as a dynamical system . in other words ,",
    "cosmology has been enclosed in the realm of science and not only of philosophy , as before the einstein work . on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility of a scientific investigation of the universe has led to the formulation of the standard cosmological model @xcite which , quite nicely , has matched with observations .    despite of these results",
    ", in the last thirty years , several shortcomings came out in the einstein theory and people began to investigate whether gr is the only fundamental theory capable of explaining the gravitational interaction .",
    "such issues come , essentially , from cosmology and quantum field theory . in the first case , the presence of the big bang singularity , the flatness and horizon problems @xcite led to the statement that cosmological standard model , based on the gr and the standard model of particle physics , is inadequate to describe the universe at extreme regimes . on the other hand , gr is a _ classical _ theory which does not work as a fundamental theory , when one wants to achieve a full quantum description of spacetime ( and then of gravity ) .    due to these facts and , first of all , to the lack of a definitive quantum gravity theory , alternative theories have been considered in order to attempt , at least , a semi - classical scheme where gr and its positive results could be recovered .",
    "one of the most fruitful approaches has been that of _ extended theories of gravity _ ( etg ) which have become a sort of paradigm in the study of gravitational interaction .",
    "they are based on corrections and enlargements of the einstein theory .",
    "the paradigm consists , essentially , in adding higher - order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields into dynamics which come out from the effective action of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "other motivations to modify gr come from the issue of a full recovering of the mach principle which leads to assume a varying gravitational coupling .",
    "the principle states that the local inertial frame is determined by some average of the motion of distant astronomical objects @xcite .",
    "this fact implies that the gravitational coupling can be scale - dependent and related to some scalar field . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of `` inertia '' and the equivalence principle have to be revised .",
    "for example , the brans - dicke theory @xcite is a serious attempt to define an alternative theory to the einstein gravity : it takes into account a variable newton gravitational coupling , whose dynamics is governed by a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the geometry .",
    "in such a way , mach s principle is better implemented @xcite .",
    "besides , every unification scheme as superstrings , supergravity or grand unified theories , takes into account effective actions where non - minimal couplings to the geometry or higher - order terms in the curvature invariants are present .",
    "such contributions are due to one - loop or higher - loop corrections in the high - curvature regimes near the full ( not yet available ) quantum gravity regime @xcite .",
    "specifically , this scheme was adopted in order to deal with the quantization on curved spacetimes and the result was that the interactions among quantum scalar fields and background geometry or the gravitational self - interactions yield corrective terms in the hilbert - einstein lagrangian @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been realized that such corrective terms are inescapable in order to obtain the effective action of quantum gravity at scales closed to the planck one @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are not the ",
    "_ full quantum gravity _ \" but are needed as working schemes toward it .    in summary , higher - order terms in curvature invariants ( such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ) or",
    "non - minimally coupled terms between scalar fields and geometry ( such as @xmath7 ) have to be added to the effective lagrangian of gravitational field when quantum corrections are considered .",
    "for instance , one can notice that such terms occur in the effective lagrangian of strings or in kaluza - klein theories , when the mechanism of dimensional reduction is used @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , from a conceptual viewpoint , there are no _ a priori _ reason to restrict the gravitational lagrangian to a linear function of the ricci scalar @xmath0 , minimally coupled with matter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the idea that there are no `` exact '' laws of physics could be taken into serious account : in such a case , the effective lagrangians of physical interactions are `` stochastic '' functions .",
    "this feature means that the local gauge invariances ( conservation laws ) are well approximated only in the low energy limit and the fundamental physical constants can vary @xcite .    besides fundamental physics motivations",
    ", all these theories have acquired a huge interest in cosmology due to the fact that they  naturally \" exhibit inflationary behaviors able to overcome the shortcomings of cosmological standard model ( based on gr ) .",
    "the related cosmological models seem realistic and capable of matching with the cmbr observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to show that , via conformal transformations , the higher - order and non - minimally coupled terms always correspond to the einstein gravity plus one or more than one minimally coupled scalar fields @xcite .    more precisely , higher - order terms appear always as contributions of order two in the field equations .",
    "for example , a term like @xmath2 gives fourth order equations @xcite , @xmath8 gives sixth order equations @xcite , @xmath9 gives eighth order equations @xcite and so on . by a conformal transformation",
    ", any 2nd - order derivative term corresponds to a scalar field : for example , fourth - order gravity gives einstein plus one scalar field , sixth - order gravity gives einstein plus two scalar fields and so on @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to show that the @xmath1-gravity is equivalent not only to a scalar - tensor one but also to the einstein theory plus an ideal fluid @xcite .",
    "this feature results very interesting if we want to obtain multiple inflationary events since an early stage could select `` very '' large - scale structures ( clusters of galaxies today ) , while a late stage could select `` small '' large - scale structures ( galaxies today ) @xcite .",
    "the philosophy is that each inflationary era is related to the dynamics of a scalar field .",
    "finally , these extended schemes could naturally solve the problem of  graceful exit \" bypassing the shortcomings of former inflationary models @xcite .",
    "in addition to the revision of standard cosmology at early epochs ( leading to the inflation ) , a new approach is necessary also at late epochs .",
    "etgs could play a fundamental role also in this context .",
    "in fact , the increasing bulk of data that have been accumulated in the last few years have paved the way to the emergence of a new cosmological model usually referred to as the _ concordance model_.    the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( hereafter sneia ) , measured by both the supernova cosmology project @xcite and the high - z team @xcite up to redshift @xmath10 , has been the first evidence that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "on the other hand , balloon born experiments , such as boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite , determined the location of the first and second peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) strongly pointing out that the geometry of the universe is spatially flat . if combined with constraints coming from galaxy clusters on the matter density parameter @xmath11 , these data indicate that the universe is dominated by a non - clustered fluid with negative pressure , generically dubbed _ dark energy _ , which is able to drive the accelerated expansion .",
    "this picture has been further strengthened by the recent precise measurements of the cmbr spectrum , due to the wmap experiment @xcite , and by the extension of the sneia hubble diagram to redshifts higher than 1 @xcite .",
    "after these observational evidences , an overwhelming flood of papers has appeared : they present a great variety of models trying to explain this phenomenon . in any case , the simplest explanation is claiming for the well known cosmological constant @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "although it is the best fit to most of the available astrophysical data @xcite , the @xmath12cdm model fails in explaining why the inferred value of @xmath12 is so tiny ( 120 orders of magnitude lower ! ) if compared with the typical vacuum energy values predicted by particle physics and why its energy density is today comparable to the matter density ( the so called _ coincidence problem _ ) .    as a tentative solution ,",
    "many authors have replaced the cosmological constant with a scalar field rolling down its potential and giving rise to the model now referred to as _ quintessence _",
    "even if successful in fitting the data , the quintessence approach to dark energy is still plagued by the coincidence problem since the dark energy and matter densities evolve differently and reach comparable values for a very limited portion of the universe evolution coinciding at present era .",
    "to be more precise , the quintessence dark energy is tracking matter and evolves in the same way for a long time .",
    "but then , at late time , somehow it has to change its behavior into no longer tracking the dark matter but starting to dominate as a cosmological constant .",
    "this is the coincidence problem of quintessence .",
    "moreover , it is not clear where this scalar field originates from , thus leaving a great uncertainty on the choice of the scalar field potential .",
    "the subtle and elusive nature of dark energy has led many authors to look for completely different scenarios able to give a quintessential behavior without the need of exotic components . to this aim , it is worth stressing that the acceleration of the universe only claims for a negative pressure dominant component , but does not tell anything about the nature and the number of cosmic fluids filling the universe .",
    "this consideration suggests that it could be possible to explain the accelerated expansion by introducing a single cosmic fluid with an equation of state causing it to act like dark matter at high densities and dark energy at low densities .",
    "an attractive feature of these models , usually referred to as _ unified dark energy _",
    "( ude ) or _ unified dark matter _ ( udm ) models , is that such an approach naturally solves , al least phenomenologically , the coincidence problem .",
    "some interesting examples are the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , the tachyon field @xcite and the condensate cosmology @xcite . a different class of ude models has been proposed @xcite where a single fluid is considered : its energy density scales with the redshift in such a way that the radiation dominated era , the matter era and the accelerating phase can be naturally achieved .",
    "it is worth noticing that such class of models are extremely versatile since they can be interpreted both in the framework of ude models and as a two - fluid scenario with dark matter and scalar field dark energy .",
    "the main ingredient of the approach is that a generalized equation of state can be always obtained and observational data can be fitted .",
    "actually , there is still a different way to face the problem of cosmic acceleration . as stressed in @xcite , it is possible that the observed acceleration is not the manifestation of another ingredient in the cosmic pie , but rather the first signal of a breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravitation ( in the infra - red limit ) .    from this point of view",
    ", it is thus tempting to modify the friedmann equations to see whether it is possible to fit the astrophysical data with models comprising only the standard matter .",
    "interesting examples of this kind are the cardassian expansion @xcite and the dgp gravity @xcite . moving in this same framework",
    ", it is possible to find alternative schemes where a quintessential behavior is obtained by taking into account effective models coming from fundamental physics giving rise to generalized or higher - order gravity actions @xcite ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) .    for instance",
    ", a cosmological constant term may be recovered as a consequence of a non - vanishing torsion field thus leading to a model which is consistent with both sneia hubble diagram and sunyaev - zeldovich data coming from clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "sneia data could also be efficiently fitted including higher - order curvature invariants in the gravity lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that these alternative models provide naturally a cosmological component with negative pressure whose origin is related to the geometry of the universe thus overcoming the problems linked to the physical significance of the scalar field .",
    "it is evident , from this short overview , the high number of cosmological models which are viable candidates to explain the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "this abundance of models is , from one hand , the signal of the fact that we have a limited number of cosmological tests to discriminate among rival theories , and , from the other hand , that a urgent degeneracy problem has to be faced . to this aim , it is useful to remark that both the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation of compact radio sources @xcite are distance based methods to probe cosmological models so then systematic errors and biases could be iterated .",
    "from this point of view , it is interesting to search for tests based on time - dependent observables .",
    "for example , one can take into account the _ lookback time _ to distant objects since this quantity can discriminate among different cosmological models . the lookback time is observationally estimated as the difference between the present day age of the universe and the age of a given object at redshift @xmath13 .",
    "such an estimate is possible if the object is a galaxy observed in more than one photometric band since its color is determined by its age as a consequence of stellar evolution .",
    "it is thus possible to get an estimate of the galaxy age by measuring its magnitude in different bands and then using stellar evolutionary codes to choose the model that reproduces the observed colors at best .",
    "coming to the weak - field - limit approximation , which essentially means considering solar system scales , etgs are expected to reproduce gr which , in any case , is firmly tested only in this limit @xcite .",
    "this fact is matter of debate since several relativistic theories _ do not _ reproduce exactly the einstein results in the newtonian approximation but , in some sense , generalize them .",
    "as it was firstly noticed by stelle @xcite , a @xmath14-theory gives rise to yukawa - like corrections in the newtonian potential .",
    "such a feature could have interesting physical consequences .",
    "for example , some authors claim to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies by using such terms @xcite .",
    "others @xcite have shown that a conformal theory of gravity is nothing else but a fourth - order theory containing such terms in the newtonian limit .",
    "besides , indications of an apparent , anomalous , long - range acceleration revealed from the data analysis of pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses spacecrafts could be framed in a general theoretical scheme by taking corrections to the newtonian potential into account @xcite .    in general , any relativistic theory of gravitation yields corrections to the newton potential ( see for example @xcite )",
    "which , in the post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism , could be a test for the same theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore the newborn _ gravitational lensing astronomy _",
    "@xcite is giving rise to additional tests of gravity over small , large , and very large scales which soon will provide direct measurements for the variation of the newton coupling @xcite , the potential of galaxies , clusters of galaxies and several other features of self - gravitating systems .",
    "such data will be , very likely , capable of confirming or ruling out the physical consistency of gr or of any etg . in summary , the general features of etgs are that the einstein field equations result to be modified in two senses : @xmath15 geometry can be non - minimally coupled to some scalar field , and/or @xmath16 higher than second order derivative terms in the metric come out . in the former case , we generically deal with scalar - tensor theories of gravity ; in the latter , we deal with higher - order theories",
    ". however combinations of non - minimally coupled and higher - order terms can emerge as contributions in effective lagrangians . in this case , we deal with higher - order - scalar - tensor theories of gravity .    considering a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the problem of reducing more general theories to einstein standard form has been extensively treated ; one can see that , through a `` legendre '' transformation on the metric , higher - order theories , under suitable regularity conditions on the lagrangian , take the form of the einstein one in which a scalar field ( or more than one ) is the source of the gravitational field ( see for example @xcite ) ; on the other side , as discussed above , it has been studied the mathematical equivalence between models with variable gravitational coupling with the einstein standard gravity through suitable conformal transformations ( see @xcite ) .    in any case , the debate on the physical meaning of conformal transformations is far to be solved [ see @xcite and references therein for a comprehensive review ] .",
    "several authors claim for a true physical difference between jordan frame ( higher - order theories and/or variable gravitational coupling ) since there are experimental and observational evidences which point out that the jordan frame could be suitable to better match solutions with data .",
    "others state that the true physical frame is the einstein one according to the energy theorems @xcite .",
    "however , the discussion is open and no definitive statement has been formulated up to now .",
    "the problem should be faced from a more general viewpoint and the palatini approach to gravity could be useful to this goal .",
    "the palatini approach in gravitational theories was firstly introduced and analyzed by einstein himself @xcite .",
    "it was , however , called the palatini approach as a consequence of an historical misunderstanding @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea of the palatini formalism is to consider the ( usually torsion - less ) connection @xmath17 , entering the definition of the ricci tensor , to be independent of the metric @xmath18 defined on the spacetime @xmath19 .",
    "the palatini formulation for the standard hilbert - einstein theory results to be equivalent to the purely metric theory : this follows from the fact that the field equations for the connection @xmath17 , firstly considered to be independent of the metric , give the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath18 .",
    "as a consequence , there is no reason to impose the palatini variational principle in the standard hilbert - einstein theory instead of the metric variational principle .",
    "however , the situation completely changes if we consider the etgs , depending on functions of curvature invariants , as @xmath1 , or non - minimally coupled to some scalar field . in these cases , the palatini and the metric variational principle provide different field equations and the theories thus derived differ @xcite .",
    "the relevance of palatini approach , in this framework , has been recently proven in relation to cosmological applications @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied the crucial problem of the newtonian potential in alternative theories of gravity and its relations with the conformal factor @xcite . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "considering the metric @xmath18 and the connection @xmath17 as independent fields means to decouple the metric structure of spacetime and its geodesic structure ( being , in general , the connection @xmath17 not the levi - civita connection of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the chronological structure of spacetime is governed by @xmath18 while the trajectories of particles , moving in the spacetime , are governed by @xmath17 .",
    "this decoupling enriches the geometric structure of spacetime and generalizes the purely metric formalism .",
    "this metric - affine structure of spacetime is naturally translated , by means of the same ( palatini ) field equations , into a bi - metric structure of spacetime . beside the _ physical _ metric @xmath18 , another metric @xmath20",
    "is involved .",
    "this new metric is related , in the case of @xmath1-gravity , to the connection . as a matter of fact",
    ", the connection @xmath17 results to be the levi - civita connection of @xmath20 and thus provides the geodesic structure of spacetime .",
    "if we consider the case of non - minimally coupled interaction in the gravitational lagrangian ( scalar - tensor theories ) , the new metric @xmath20 is related to the non - minimal coupling .",
    "the new metric @xmath20 can be thus related to a different geometric and physical aspect of the gravitational theory .",
    "thanks to the palatini formalism , the non - minimal coupling and the scalar field , entering the evolution of the gravitational fields , are separated from the metric structure of spacetime .",
    "the situation mixes when we consider the case of higher - order - scalar - tensor theories . due to these features , the palatini approach could greatly contribute to clarify the physical meaning of conformal transformation @xcite .    in this review paper , without claiming for completeness ,",
    "we want to give a survey on the formal and physical aspects of etgs in metric and palatini approaches , considering the cosmological and astrophysical applications of some etg models .",
    "the layout is the following .",
    "sect.ii is a rapid overview of gr .",
    "we summarize what a good theory of gravity is requested to do and what the foundations of the einstein theory are .",
    "the goal is to demonstrate that etgs have the same theoretical bases but , in principle , could avoid some shortcomings of gr which is nothing else but a particular case of etg , @xmath21 .",
    "the field equations for generic etgs are derived in sec.iii .",
    "specifically , we discuss two interesting cases : @xmath1 and scalar - tensor theories considering their relations with gr by conformal transformations .",
    "the palatini approach and its intrinsic conformal structure is discussed in sec.iv giving some peculiar examples .",
    "cosmological applications are considered in sec.v .",
    "after a short summary of @xmath12cdm model , we show that dark energy and quintessence issues can be addressed as `` curvature effects '' , if etgs ( in particular @xmath1 theories ) are considered .",
    "we work out some cosmological models comparing the solutions with data coming from observational surveys . as further result",
    ", we show that also the stochastic cosmological background of gravitational waves could be `` tuned '' by etgs .",
    "this fact could open new perspective also in the issues of detection and production of gravitational waves which should be investigated not only in the standard framework of gr .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to the galactic dynamics under the standard of etgs . also in this case",
    ", we show that flat rotation curves and haloes of spiral galaxies could be explained as curvature effects which give rise to corrections to the newton potential without taking into account huge amounts of dark matter .",
    "discussion and conclusions are drawn in sec.vii .",
    "from a phenomenological point of view , there are some minimal requirements that any relativistic theory of gravity has to match .",
    "first of all , it has to explain the astrophysical observations ( e.g. the orbits of planets , the potential of self - gravitating structures ) .",
    "this means that it has to reproduce the newtonian dynamics in the weak - energy limit . besides",
    ", it has to pass the classical solar system tests which are all experimentally well founded @xcite .    as second step",
    ", it should reproduce galactic dynamics considering the observed baryonic constituents ( e.g. luminous components as stars , sub - luminous components as planets , dust and gas ) , radiation and newtonian potential which is , by assumption , extrapolated to galactic scales .",
    "thirdly , it should address the problem of large scale structure ( e.g. clustering of galaxies ) and finally cosmological dynamics , which means to reproduce , in a self - consistent way , the cosmological parameters as the expansion rate , the hubble constant , the density parameter and so on .",
    "observations and experiments , essentially , probe the standard baryonic matter , the radiation and an attractive overall interaction , acting at all scales and depending on distance : the gravity .    the simplest theory which try to satisfies the above requirements was formulated by albert einstein in the years 1915 - 1916 @xcite",
    "and it is known as the theory of general relativity .",
    "it is firstly based on the assumption that space and time have to be entangled into a single spacetime structure , which , in the limit of no gravitational forces , has to reproduce the minkowski spacetime structure .",
    "einstein profitted also of ideas earlier put forward by riemann , who stated that the universe should be a curved manifold and that its curvature should be established on the basis of astronomical observations @xcite .    in other words ,",
    "the distribution of matter has to influence point by point the local curvature of the spacetime structure .",
    "the theory , eventually formulated by einstein in 1915 , was strongly based on three assumptions that the physics of gravitation has to satisfy .",
    "the `` _ principle of relativity _ '' , that amounts to require all frames to be good frames for physics , so that no preferred inertial frame should be chosen a priori ( if any exist ) .",
    "the `` _ principle of equivalence _ '' , that amounts to require inertial effects to be locally indistinguishable from gravitational effects ( in a sense , the equivalence between the inertial and the gravitational mass ) .",
    "the `` _ principle of general covariance _ '' , that requires field equations to be `` generally covariant '' ( today , we would better say to be invariant under the action of the group of all spacetime diffeomorphisms ) @xcite .    and - on the top of these three principles - the requirement that causality has to be preserved ( the `` _ principle of causality _ '' , i.e. that each point of spacetime should admit a universally valid notion of past , present and future ) .",
    "let us also recall that the older newtonian theory of spacetime and gravitation - that einstein wanted to reproduce at least in the limit of small gravitational forces ( what is called today the `` post - newtonian approximation '' ) - required space and time to be absolute entities , particles moving in a preferred inertial frame following curved trajectories , the curvature of which ( i.e. , the acceleration ) had to be determined as a function of the sources ( i.e. , the `` forces '' ) .    on these bases",
    ", einstein was led to postulate that the gravitational forces have to be expressed by the curvature of a metric tensor field @xmath22 on a four - dimensional spacetime manifold , having the same signature of minkowski metric , i.e. , the so - called `` lorentzian signature '' , herewith assumed to be @xmath23 .",
    "he also postulated that spacetime is curved in itself and that its curvature is locally determined by the distribution of the sources , i.e. - being spacetime a continuum - by the four - dimensional generalization of what in continuum mechanics is called the `` matter stress - energy tensor '' , i.e. a rank - two ( symmetric ) tensor @xmath24 .",
    "once a metric @xmath25 is given , its curvature is expressed by the riemann ( curvature ) tensor    @xmath26    where the comas are partial derivatives .",
    "its contraction @xmath27 is the `` ricci tensor '' and the scalar @xmath28 is called the `` scalar curvature '' of @xmath25 .",
    "einstein was led to postulate the following equations for the dynamics of gravitational forces @xmath29 where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 is a coupling constant .",
    "these equations turned out to be physically and mathematically unsatisfactory .",
    "as hilbert pointed out @xcite , they were not of a variational origin , i.e. there was no lagrangian able to reproduce them exactly ( this is slightly wrong , but this remark is unessential here ) .",
    "einstein replied that he knew that the equations were physically unsatisfactory , since they were contrasting with the continuity equation of any reasonable kind of matter .",
    "assuming that matter is given as a perfect fluid , that is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a comoving observer , @xmath34 is the pressure and @xmath35 the density of the fluid , then the continuity equation requires @xmath24 to be covariantly constant , i.e. to satisfy the conservation law @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the metric .    in fact , it is not true that @xmath38 vanishes ( unless @xmath39 ) .",
    "einstein and hilbert reached independently the conclusion that the wrong field equations ( [ wrong ] ) had to be replaced by the correct ones @xmath40 where @xmath41 that is currently called the `` einstein tensor '' of @xmath25 .",
    "these equations are both variational and satisfy the conservation laws ( [ conservation ] ) since the following relation holds ^ g _",
    "= 0,as a byproduct of the so - called `` bianchi identities '' that the curvature tensor of @xmath25 has to satisfy @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian that allows to obtain the field equations ( [ field ] ) is the sum of a `` matter lagrangian '' @xmath42 , the variational derivative of which is exactly @xmath24 , i.e. t^m _ = and of a `` gravitational lagrangian '' , currently called the hilbert - einstein lagrangian[he ] l_he = g^ r",
    "_ = r , where @xmath43 denotes the square root of the value of the determinant of the metric @xmath25 .",
    "the choice of hilbert and einstein was completely arbitrary ( as it became clear a few years later ) , but it was certainly the simplest one both from the mathematical and the physical viewpoint .",
    "as it was later clarified by levi - civita in 1919 , curvature is not a `` purely metric notion '' but , rather , a notion related to the `` linear connection '' to which `` parallel transport '' and `` covariant derivation '' refer @xcite .    in a sense , this is the precursor idea of what in the sequel would be called a `` gauge theoretical framework '' @xcite , after the pioneering work by cartan in 1925 @xcite .",
    "but at the time of einstein , only metric concepts were at hands and his solution was the only viable .",
    "it was later clarified that the three principles of relativity , equivalence and covariance , together with causality , just require that the spacetime structure has to be determined by either one or both of two fields , a lorentzian metric @xmath18 and a linear connection @xmath17 , assumed to be torsionless for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the metric @xmath18 fixes the causal structure of spacetime ( the light cones ) as well as its metric relations ( clocks and rods ) ; the connection @xmath17 fixes the free - fall , i.e. the locally inertial observers .",
    "they have , of course , to satisfy a number of compatibility relations which amount to require that photons follow null geodesics of @xmath17 , so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be independent , _ a priori _ , but constrained , _ a posteriori _ , by some physical restrictions .",
    "these , however , do not impose that @xmath17 has necessarily to be the levi - civita connection of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this justifies - at least on a purely theoretical basis - the fact that one can envisage the so - called `` alternative theories of gravitation '' , that we prefer to call `` _ extended theories of gravitation _ ''",
    "since their starting points are exactly those considered by einstein and hilbert : theories in which gravitation is described by either a metric ( the so - called `` purely metric theories '' ) , or by a linear connection ( the so - called `` purely affine theories '' ) or by both fields ( the so - called `` metric - affine theories '' , also known as `` first order formalism theories '' ) . in these theories ,",
    "the lagrangian is a scalar density of the curvature invariants constructed out of both @xmath18 and @xmath17 .    the choice ( [ he ] ) is by no means unique and it turns out that the hilbert - einstein lagrangian is in fact the only choice that produces an invariant that is linear in second derivatives of the metric ( or first derivatives of the connection ) .",
    "a lagrangian that , unfortunately , is rather singular from the hamiltonian viewpoint , in much than same way as lagrangians , linear in canonical momenta , are rather singular in classical mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a number of attempts to generalize gr ( and unify it to electromagnetism ) along these lines were followed by einstein himself and many others ( eddington , weyl , schrodinger , just to quote the main contributors ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) but they were eventually given up in the fifties of xx century , mainly because of a number of difficulties related to the definitely more complicated structure of a non - linear theory ( where by `` non - linear '' we mean here a theory that is based on non - linear invariants of the curvature tensor ) , and also because of the new understanding of physics that is currently based on four fundamental forces and requires the more general `` gauge framework '' to be adopted ( see @xcite ) .",
    "still a number of sporadic investigations about `` alternative theories '' continued even after 1960 ( see @xcite and refs . quoted therein for a short history ) .",
    "the search of a coherent quantum theory of gravitation or the belief that gravity has to be considered as a sort of low - energy limit of string theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) - something that we are not willing to enter here in detail - has more or less recently revitalized the idea that there is no reason to follow the simple prescription of einstein and hilbert and to assume that gravity should be classically governed by a lagrangian linear in the curvature .",
    "further curvature invariants or non - linear functions of them should be also considered , especially in view of the fact that they have to be included in both the semi - classical expansion of a quantum lagrangian or in the low - energy limit of a string lagrangian .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the recent astrophysical observations and from the current cosmological hypotheses that einstein equations are no longer a good test for gravitation at solar system , galactic , extra - galactic and cosmic scale , unless one does not admit that the matter side of eqs.([field ] ) contains some kind of exotic matter - energy which is the `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' side of the universe .",
    "the idea which we propose here is much simpler . instead of changing the matter side of einstein equations ( [ field ] ) in order to fit the `` missing matter - energy '' content of the currently observed universe ( up to the @xmath44 of the total amount ! ) , by adding any sort of inexplicable and strangely behaving matter and energy , we claim that it is simpler and more convenient to change the gravitational side of the equations , admitting corrections coming from non - linearities in the lagrangian .",
    "however , this is nothing else but a matter of taste and , since it is possible , such an approach should be explored .",
    "of course , provided that the lagrangian can be conveniently tuned up ( i.e. , chosen in a huge family of allowed lagrangians ) on the basis of its best fit with all possible observational tests , at all scales ( solar , galactic , extragalactic and cosmic ) .",
    "something that - in spite of some commonly accepted but disguised opinion - can and should be done before rejecting a priori a non - linear theory of gravitation ( based on a non - singular lagrangian ) and insisting that the universe has to be necessarily described by a rather singular gravitational lagrangian ( one that does not allow a coherent perturbation theory from a good hamiltonian viewpoint ) accompanied by matter that does not follow the behavior that standard baryonic matter , probed in our laboratories , usually satisfies .",
    "with the above considerations in mind , let us start with a general class of higher - order - scalar - tensor theories in four dimensions , @xmath45 , @xmath46 which are also possible . ] given by the action [ 3.1 ] a = d^4x , where @xmath47 is an unspecified function of curvature invariants and of a scalar field @xmath48 .",
    "the term @xmath49 , as above , is the minimally coupled ordinary matter contribution .",
    "we shall use physical units @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is a constant which specifies the theory . actually its values can be @xmath52 fixing the nature and the dynamics of the scalar field which can be a standard scalar field , a phantom field or a field without dynamics ( see @xcite for details ) .    in the metric approach ,",
    "the field equations are obtained by varying ( [ 3.1 ] ) with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "we get [ 3.2 ] g&= & , where @xmath54 is the above einstein tensor and [ 3.4 ] g_j=0^n^j ( ) . the differential eqs.([3.2 ] ) are of order @xmath55 .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is due to the kinetic part of the scalar field and to the ordinary matter : [ 3.5 ] t = t^m+[- ] .",
    "the ( eventual ) contribution of a potential @xmath56 is contained in the definition of @xmath47 .",
    "from now on , we shall indicate by a capital @xmath47 a lagrangian density containing also the contribution of a potential @xmath56 and by @xmath57 , @xmath1 , or @xmath58 a function of such fields without potential .    by varying with respect to the scalar field @xmath48",
    ", we obtain the klein - gordon equation [ 3.6 ] = - .",
    "several approaches can be used to deal with such equations .",
    "for example , as we said , by a conformal transformation , it is possible to reduce an etg to a ( multi ) scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the simplest extension of gr is achieved assuming [ fr ] f = f(r),=0,in the action ( [ 3.1 ] ) ; @xmath1 is an arbitrary ( analytic ) function of the ricci curvature scalar @xmath0 .",
    "we are considering here the simplest case of fourth - order gravity but we could construct such kind of theories also using other invariants in @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "the standard hilbert - einstein action is , of course , recovered for @xmath21 .",
    "varying with respect to @xmath61 , we get the field equations @xmath62 which are fourth - order equations due to the term @xmath63 ; the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath0 . eq.([h2 ] ) is also the equation for @xmath64 when the matter term is absent .    by a suitable manipulation ,",
    "the above equation can be rewritten as : @xmath65 + f'(r)\\ddeab -g\\dab\\box f'(r)\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where the gravitational contribution due to higher - order terms can be simply reinterpreted as a stress - energy tensor contribution .",
    "this means that additional and higher - order terms in the gravitational action act , in principle , as a stress - energy tensor , related to the form of @xmath1 .",
    "considering also the standard perfect - fluid matter contribution , we have @xmath66 + f'(r)\\ddeab -g\\dab\\box f'(r)\\right\\}+ \\frac{t^{m}_{\\alpha \\beta}}{f'(r)}=t^{curv}_{\\alpha\\beta}+\\frac{t^{m}_{\\alpha \\beta}}{f'(r)}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is an effective stress - energy tensor constructed by the extra curvature terms . in the case of gr , @xmath67 identically vanishes while the standard , minimal coupling is recovered for the matter contribution .",
    "the peculiar behavior of @xmath21 is due to the particular form of the lagrangian itself which , even though it is a second order lagrangian , can be non - covariantly rewritten as the sum of a first order lagrangian plus a pure divergence term .",
    "the hilbert - einstein lagrangian can be in fact recast as follows : @xmath68\\ ] ] where : @xmath69 @xmath17 is the levi - civita connection of @xmath18 and @xmath70 is a quantity constructed out with the variation of @xmath17 @xcite . since @xmath71 is not a tensor ,",
    "the above expression is not covariant ; however a standard procedure has been studied to recast covariance in the first order theories @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that the field equations should consequently be second order and the hilbert - einstein lagrangian is thus degenerate .    from the action ( [ 3.1 ] ) , it is possible to obtain another interesting case by choosing f = f()r - v(),=-1.in this case , we get @xmath72\\ ] ] @xmath73 and @xmath74 are generic functions describing respectively the potential and the coupling of a scalar field @xmath75 . the brans - dicke theory of gravity is a particular case of the action ( [ s1 ] ) for @xmath73=0 @xcite .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath53 gives the second - order field equations @xmath76= -\\half t^{\\f}\\dmunu- g\\dmunu \\box_{g } f(\\f)+ f(\\f)\\ddemunu\\,,\\ ] ] here @xmath77 is the dalembert operator with respect to the metric @xmath18 the energy - momentum tensor relative to the scalar field is @xmath78 the variation with respect to @xmath75 provides the klein - gordon equation , i.e. the field equation for the scalar field : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "this last equation is equivalent to the bianchi contracted identity @xcite .",
    "standard fluid matter can be treated as above .",
    "let us now introduce conformal transformations to show that any higher - order or scalar - tensor theory , in absence of ordinary matter , e.g. a perfect fluid , is conformally equivalent to an einstein theory plus minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "if standard matter is present , conformal transformations allow to transfer non - minimal coupling to the matter component @xcite .",
    "the conformal transformation on the metric @xmath53 is @xmath82 in which @xmath83 is the conformal factor . under this transformation ,",
    "the lagrangian in ( [ s1 ] ) becomes @xmath84 in which @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the ricci scalar and the dalembert operator relative to the metric @xmath87 . requiring the theory in the metric @xmath88 to appear as a standard einstein theory @xcite , the conformal factor has to be related to @xmath47 , that is @xmath89 where @xmath47 must be negative in order to restore physical coupling . using this relation and introducing a new scalar field @xmath90 and a new potential @xmath91 , defined respectively by @xmath92",
    "we see that the lagrangian ( [ s7 ] ) becomes @xmath93 which is the usual hilbert - einstein lagrangian plus the standard lagrangian relative to the scalar field @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , every non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory , in absence of ordinary matter , e.g. perfect fluid , is conformally equivalent to an einstein theory , being the conformal transformation and the potential suitably defined by ( [ s8 ] ) and ( [ s10 ] ) .",
    "the converse is also true : for a given @xmath74 , such that @xmath94 , we can transform a standard einstein theory into a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory .",
    "this means that , in principle , if we are able to solve the field equations in the framework of the einstein theory in presence of a scalar field with a given potential , we should be able to get the solutions for the scalar - tensor theories , assigned by the coupling @xmath74 , via the conformal transformation ( [ s8 ] ) with the constraints given by ( [ s10 ] ) . following the standard terminology , the `` einstein frame '' is the framework of the einstein theory with the minimal coupling and the `` jordan frame '' is the framework of the non - minimally coupled theory @xcite .",
    "+ in the context of alternative theories of gravity , as previously discussed , the gravitational contribution to the stress - energy tensor of the theory can be reinterpreted by means of a conformal transformation as the stress - energy tensor of a suitable scalar field and then as  matter \" like terms . performing the conformal transformation ( [ s6 ] ) in the field equations ( [ h3 ] ) , we get : @xmath95 + f'(r)\\ddeab- g\\dab\\box f'(r)\\right\\}+\\ ] ] @xmath96 we",
    "can then choose the conformal factor to be @xmath97 which has now to be substituted into ( [ h4 ] ) .",
    "rescaling @xmath98 in such a way that @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we obtain the lagrangian equivalence @xmath101 and the einstein equations in standard form @xmath102 with the potential @xmath103 = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{f(r)-rf'(r)}{f'(r)^{2}}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath104 is the inverse function of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "however , the problem is completely solved if @xmath105 can be analytically inverted . in summary ,",
    "a fourth - order theory is conformally equivalent to the standard second - order einstein theory plus a scalar field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ this procedure can be extended to more general theories .",
    "if the theory is assumed to be higher than fourth order , we may have lagrangian densities of the form @xcite , @xmath107 every @xmath108 operator introduces two further terms of derivation into the field equations . for example a theory like @xmath109 is a sixth - order theory and the above approach can be pursued by considering a conformal factor of the form @xmath110 in general , increasing two orders of derivation in the field equations ( for every term @xmath111 ) , corresponds to adding a scalar field in the conformally transformed frame @xcite .",
    "a sixth - order theory can be reduced to an einstein theory with two minimally coupled scalar fields ; a @xmath112-order theory can be , in principle , reduced to an einstein theory plus @xmath113-scalar fields .",
    "on the other hand , these considerations can be directly generalized to higher - order - scalar - tensor theories in any number of dimensions as shown in @xcite .    as concluding remarks",
    ", we can say that conformal transformations work at three levels : @xmath15 on the lagrangian of the given theory ; @xmath16 on the field equations ; @xmath114 on the solutions .",
    "the table below summarizes the situation for fourth - order gravity ( fog ) , non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theories ( nmc ) and standard hilbert - einstein ( he ) theory . clearly",
    ", direct and inverse transformations correlate all the steps of the table but no absolute criterion , at this point of the discussion , is able to select which is the  physical \" framework since , at least from a mathematical point of view , all the frames are equivalent @xcite .",
    "this point is up to now unsolved even if wide discussions are present in literature @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this paper , we have outlined what one should intend for etgs in the metric and in the palatini approach . in particular , we have discussed the higher - order and the scalar - tensor theories of gravity showing the relations between them and their connection to gr via the conformal transformations .    in the so called einstein frame",
    ", any etg can be reduced to the hilbert - einstein action plus one or more than one scalar field(s ) .",
    "the physical meaning of conformal transformations can be particularly devised in the palatini approach , as discussed in sec.iv .",
    "after , we have discussed some cosmological and astrophysical applications of etgs .    although the results outlined are referred to the simplest class of etgs , power law @xmath1 , they could represent an interesting paradigm .",
    "assuming both metric and palatini approach , it is possible to investigate the viability of @xmath1 cosmological models .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath115 may be analytically expressed as a function of the redshift @xmath13 , so that it is possible to contrast the model predictions against the observations . in particular , the sneia hubble diagram , the gas mass fraction in relaxed galaxy clusters , the lookback time to galaxy clusters , and radio galaxies can be used to constrain cosmological parameters by distance and time - based methods .",
    "also if such models are , up to now , not completely satisfactory to match all the observations , they allow to recover accelerated behavior of hubble fluid without any unknown form of dark energy . however , the issue of structure formation has to be seriously faced in order to understand if such toy models could give rise to a self - consistent alternative theory to gr .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to `` tune '' the stochastic background of gws and this occurrence could constitute a further cosmological test capable of confirming or ruling out etgs once data from interferometers , like virgo , ligo and lisa , will be available .",
    "in addition , the modification of the gravitational potential arising as a natural effect in the framework of etgs can represent a fundamental tool to interpret the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "besides , if one considers the model parameters settled by the fit over the observational data on rotation curves , it is possible to construct a phenomenological analogous of dark matter halo whose shape is similar to the one of the so called burkert model . since burkert s model has been empirically introduced to give account for the dark matter distribution in the case of lsb and dwarf galaxies , this result could represent an interesting achievement since it provides a theoretical foundation to such a model .    by investigating the relation between dark halo and the galaxy disk parameters , a relation between @xmath116 and @xmath117 , reproducing the baryonic tully - fisher , can be deduced .",
    "in fact , exploiting the relation between the virial mass and the disk parameters , one obtains a relation for the virial velocity which can be satisfactory approximated as @xmath118 .",
    "even such a result seems intriguing since it provides a theoretical interpretation for a phenomenological relation .    as a matter of fact , although not definitive , these phenomenological issues can represent a viable approach for future , more exhaustive investigations of etgs . in particular , they support the quest for a unified view of the dark side of the universe . in summary , these results seem to motivate a careful search for a fundamental theory of gravity capable of explaining the full cosmic dynamics by the only `` ingredients '' which we can directly and firmly experience , namely the background gravity , the baryonic matter , the radiation and also the neutrinos @xcite .",

    "<S> astrophysical observations are pointing out huge amounts of `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' needed to explain the observed large scale structure and cosmic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging picture is a spatially flat , homogeneous universe undergoing the today observed accelerated phase . despite of the good quality of astrophysical surveys , commonly addressed as _ precision cosmology _ , the nature and the nurture of dark energy and dark matter , which should constitute the bulk of cosmological matter - energy , are still unknown . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , up to now , no experimental evidence has been found , at fundamental level , to explain such mysterious components .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem could be completely reversed considering dark matter and dark energy as `` shortcomings '' of general relativity in its simplest formulation ( a linear theory in the ricci scalar @xmath0 , minimally coupled to the standard perfect fluid matter ) and claiming for the `` correct '' theory of gravity as that derived by matching the largest number of observational data , without imposing any theory _ a priori_. as a working hypothesis , accelerating behavior of cosmic fluid , large scale structure , potential of galaxy clusters , rotation curves of spiral galaxies could be reproduced by means of _ extending _ the standard theory of general relativity . in other words , gravity could acts in different ways at different scales and the above `` shortcomings '' could be due to incorrect extrapolations of the einstein gravity , actually tested at short scales and low energy regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> after a survey of what is intended for _ extended theories of gravity _ in the so called `` metric '' and `` palatini '' approaches , we discuss some cosmological and astrophysical applications where the issues related to the dark components are addressed by enlarging the einstein theory to more general @xmath1 lagrangians , where @xmath1 is a generic function of ricci scalar @xmath0 , not assumed simply linear . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this is not the final answer to the problem of `` dark - components '' but it can be considered as an operative scheme whose aim is to avoid the addition of unknown exotic ingredients to the cosmic pie . </S>"
