    "born - infeld electrodynamics has attracted considerable interest over recent years .",
    "it was originally introduced in the 1930s  @xcite as an attempt to describe the classical electron entirely in terms of its electromagnetic field , but interest in it soon waned in favour of quantum theory . however , during the first superstring revolution in the mid-1980s it was shown that born - infeld - type theories are a feature of low energy string field theory  @xcite , and this discovery led to the resurgence of interest in born - infeld electrodynamics seen recently  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , among the family of non - linear generalizations of maxwell electrodynamics , it has long been known that born - infeld theory possesses a number of highly attractive features ; in particular , like the vacuum maxwell equations , the born - infeld equations exhibit zero birefringence and its solutions have exceptional causal behaviour  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum maxwell and born - infeld field equations are the only physical theories with a single light cone obtainable from a local lagrangian constructed solely from the two lorentz invariants associated with the electromagnetic field strength tensor and the metric tensor .",
    "any self - consistent theory describing a large collection of charged particles must include all electromagnetic forces between the particles .",
    "however , the notorious problem of determining the classical force on a single accelerating point charge due to its own electromagnetic field has stimulated research for over a century and remains unresolved .",
    "the structure of an isolated single electron is currently beyond observation and one often proceeds classically by associating the electron with a singularity in the electromagnetic field described by maxwell s equations in vacuo . following dirac  @xcite , an equation of motion for the electron may be obtained by appealing to conservation of the total energy - momentum of the electron and its electromagnetic field ( see  @xcite for a recent discussion ) . in order to remove singularities in the equation of motion ,",
    "dirac made `` natural assumptions '' about the origin of the electron mass .",
    "the resulting lorentz - dirac equation of motion contains _ third _ order proper time derivatives of the electron s world line , and possesses solutions that violate intuition . in particular , unless special conditions are adopted for the final state of the electron , it predicts that a free electron in vacuo can self - accelerate ; furthermore the equations possess solutions in which the electron experiences a sudden acceleration before it enters a region of space containing a non - vanishing external electrostatic field ( see  @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "the search for a complete dynamical theory of a point charge within born - infeld electrodynamics is on - going  @xcite , and this theory is expected to provide a resolution to the radiation - reaction problem . in particular , the difficulties associated with the lorentz - dirac equation are thought to have their origin in the electron s singular total mass - energy in classical maxwell electrodynamics ; however , the electric field of a born - infeld electron at rest is non - singular and its total mass - energy is finite .",
    "some of the most extreme conditions ever encountered in a terrestrial laboratory are created when high - power laser pulses interact with matter .",
    "the laser pulse immediately vaporizes the matter to form an intense laser - plasma providing novel avenues for generating intense bursts of coherent electromagnetic radiation for a wide range of applications in biological and material science  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , laser - plasmas permit controllable investigation of matter in extreme conditions that only occur naturally away from the earth .",
    "it is expected that the next generation of ultra - intense lasers will , for the first time , allow controllable access to regimes where a host of different quantum electrodynamic phenomena will be evident . in particular , the challenge of extending schwinger s classic analysis  @xcite of vacuum breakdown in a static external electric field to breakdown in an intense laser - plasma is on - going  @xcite . however , the radiation - reaction problem is sufficiently strong motivation for exploring whether a born - infeld - type theory can yield experimental signatures _ before _",
    "quantum effects become significant  @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently short and intense laser pulse propagating through a plasma may create a travelling longitudinal plasma wave whose phase velocity is approximately the same as the laser pulse s group velocity .",
    "however , it is not possible to sustain arbitrarily large electric fields ; substantial numbers of plasma electrons become trapped in the wave and are accelerated , which dampens the wave ( the wave ` breaks ' ) .",
    "early theoretical investigation of non - linear plasma waves was undertaken in the mid 1950s by akhiezer and polovin  @xcite , and later expounded by dawson  @xcite in the context of wave - breaking .",
    "furthermore , this acceleration mechanism was recently employed  @xcite to explain the emission of energetic electrons from within the interiors of pulsars ; such electrons are necessary for the formation of the electron - positron plasma populating a pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "wave - breaking is a fundamentally non - linear phenomenon , and it is natural to explore the properties of born - infeld plasmas from this perspective .",
    "moreover , the magnetic fields found in neutron stars are typically @xmath0 , whilst those in magnetars may be two orders of magnitude higher and such fields have energy densities commensurate with the schwinger limit ( i.e. commensurate with a static electric field of strength @xmath1 ) .    the following is a brief summary of our recent analysis of born - infeld plasma waves near breaking .",
    "the present work is an application of the approach established in  @xcite , generalized here to include the presence of a background magnetic field .",
    "the notation and conventions used here are identical to those in  @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details",
    ". in particular , we use units in which the speed of light @xmath2 and the permittivity of the vacuum @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a spacetime .",
    "the electromagnetic sector of a born - infeld plasma may be expressed in terms of the lagrangian @xmath5 , @xmath6 where the invariants @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9 with @xmath10 the hodge map associated with the spacetime metric @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a constant that characterizes the self - interaction of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the relationship between the excitation @xmath13-form @xmath14 and the maxwell @xmath13-form @xmath15 is @xmath16 and maxwell electrodynamics ( where @xmath17 ) is recovered in the limit @xmath18 .    for simplicity ,",
    "the plasma electrons are represented as a _ cold _ relativistic fluid ; their worldlines are trajectories of a unit normalized future - pointing timelike @xmath19-vector field @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the charge on the electron , @xmath23 is the electron rest mass , @xmath24 is the lorentz @xmath19-force acting on the electron fluid , @xmath25 is the interior product with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath26 is the levi - civita connection on @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28-form @xmath29 is the metric dual of the vector field @xmath20 , i.e. the @xmath28-form @xmath29 satisfies @xmath30 for all vector fields @xmath31 on @xmath27 .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of a plasma over timescales during which the motion of the ions is negligible in comparison with the motion of the electrons . here",
    "the ions are specified as a background and their worldlines are trajectories of the prescribed future - pointing timelike @xmath19-vector field @xmath32 ( the ion number @xmath19-current ) on @xmath27 .",
    "maxwell s equations are @xmath33 where the @xmath34-form @xmath35 is the electron proper number density and @xmath36 is the charge on an ion , with @xmath37 the multiplicity of the ionization .",
    "the @xmath28-form @xmath38 is the metric dual of the vector field @xmath32 .",
    "particle acceleration in non - linear electrostatic waves close to breaking has recently been proposed as a possible mechanism for explaining how energetic electrons are ejected from within the interiors of pulsars  @xcite .",
    "if an atom is immersed in a uniform background magnetic field whose strength is much greater than @xmath39 then the corresponding magnetic force on the electrons is much greater than the atom s coulombic forces @xcite .",
    "the atom settles into the ground landau level , limiting the electrons spatial displacement transverse to the magnetic field lines .",
    "thus , electrons are conducted preferentially along the direction of the magnetic field lines , and one may approximate the bulk electron motion as 1-dimensional  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field lines in the iron crust of a neutron star are expected to run parallel to its surface and to be strongly curved near the poles , where they emerge normal to the star s surface .",
    "the magnetic curvature near the poles is expected to lead to variations in electron number density and excite electrostatic waves in the electron ` gas ' within the iron crust  @xcite .    to obtain some insight into the behaviour of a born - infeld plasma in this context , in the following",
    "we explore properties of solutions to ( [ lorentz ] ) , ( [ maxwell ] ) that describe large - amplitude longitudinal electrostatic waves propagating in a uniform background ion density in a flat spacetime .",
    "it is useful to envisage the electrons in the plasma as belonging to one or other of two families .",
    "the first family and the ion background are represented by the triple @xmath40 and constitute the bulk plasma ; those electrons and the background ions form the electrostatic wave .",
    "the members of the second family are the rest of the electron population , some of which are trapped in the wave s potential ; we do not attempt to include the second family in the simple model explored here .",
    "let @xmath41 be an inertial coordinate system on minkowski spacetime @xmath4 where @xmath42 is the proper time of observers at fixed cartesian coordinates @xmath43 .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath11 has the form @xmath44 with @xmath45 and the hodge map @xmath10 is induced from the @xmath19-form @xmath46 on @xmath47 where @xmath48 the ion background is given as the number @xmath19-current @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "the longitudinal electrostatic waves considered here propagate parallel to the @xmath51-axis with phase velocity @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 ) in the ion rest frame .",
    "we introduce the pair @xmath54 @xmath55 and note that the orthonormal co - frame @xmath56 is adapted to observers moving at velocity @xmath52 along @xmath51 ( observers in the ` wave frame ' ) , where the lorentz factor @xmath57 .",
    "we seek a unit normalized @xmath19-velocity field @xmath20 of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the wave s phase and @xmath60 .",
    "we have adopted the so - called ` quasi - static approximation ' ; the pointwise dependence of @xmath61 is on @xmath62 only .",
    "the velocity of the bulk plasma electrons observed in the wave frame is @xmath63 in the direction of _ decreasing _",
    "@xmath51 , so the electrons move slower than the wave propagates .",
    "the maximum amplitude wave arises for oscillations during which @xmath61 is arbitrarily close to @xmath64 ( i.e. the bulk plasma electrons catch the wave ) .",
    "the maxwell @xmath13-form @xmath15 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath51 component of the electric field and its pointwise dependence is on @xmath62 only .",
    "the constant @xmath67 is the component of the magnetic field along @xmath51 , and the remaining components of the electric and magnetic field vanish .",
    "employment of ( [ metric])-([maxwell_2-form ] ) reduces ( [ def_g])-([maxwell ] ) to a second - order ordinary differential equation for @xmath61 , viz .",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69    inspection of ( [ ode_for_mu ] ) reveals that , for oscillatory solutions , the electric field @xmath66 has a turning point where @xmath70 .",
    "further investigation reveals that this turning point is a minimum of @xmath66 ( for @xmath22 ) , and an upper bound @xmath71 ( ` wave - breaking limit ' ) on @xmath66 may be obtained by evaluating the first integral of ( [ ode_for_mu ] ) between the points @xmath72 and @xmath73 . restoring the speed of light @xmath74 and permittivity of the vacuum @xmath75 yields @xmath76^{-2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the maximum electric field for a relativistic cold maxwell plasma , @xmath78 first obtained by akhiezer and polovin  @xcite , and the constant @xmath79 is the plasma frequency @xmath80 if @xmath81 then @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath83 , which is within the range of the surface magnetic fields of rotation - powered radio pulsars  @xcite .",
