    "let @xmath382 be a vector of positive integers and fix the configuration @xmath383 represents a product of simplices , and the corresponding toric variety is the product @xmath384 in the standard segre embedding .",
    "consider a lexicographic term order @xmath257 such that @xmath385 is higher than all other elements of @xmath386 . since the polytope @xmath387 is smooth , the resulting _ lexicographic triangulation _",
    "@xmath388 has exactly one maximal simplex which contains the vertex @xmath385 .",
    "this simplex is denoted @xmath389 , and it is formed by the vertices that are neighbors of @xmath385 . in other words ,",
    "the simplex @xmath389 contains all @xmath390 such that the hamming distance between the vectors @xmath391 and @xmath392 is at most one .",
    "now consider a set of indices @xmath393 with the property that the hamming distance between @xmath394 and @xmath395 is greater than two for all @xmath396 .",
    "let @xmath135 be any lexicographic triangulation of @xmath386 which puts the elements in @xmath397 lexicographically larger than all elements of @xmath398 .",
    "by our assumption on the hamming distance between elements of @xmath33 , each simplex @xmath399 appears in the triangulation @xmath135 , and these simplices are disjoint .",
    "thus , if such an index set of cardinality @xmath400 exists , the secant varieties @xmath401 for @xmath402 will all have the expected dimension by theorem [ partitionable ] .",
    "this combinatorial technique for proving that secant varieties to certain segre varieties have the expected dimension was introduced by catalisano , geramita and gimigliano in @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , finding",
    "an @xmath400-element index set @xmath33 with pairwise hamming distance greater than @xmath159 is equivalent to finding a placement of @xmath400 rooks on a @xmath403 chessboard with the property that no two rooks attack each other or attack the same square on the board .",
    "our approach via triangulations can be used to get information about further invariants ( beyond dimension ) of such secant varieties .    to conclude this section",
    ", we explore the existence of delightful triangulations for the class of rational normal scrolls .",
    "while all the secant ideals in question are known to have nice determinantal presentations , not every scroll has a delightful term order .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , considering our results on delightful term orders for minors and pfaffians in section [ sec : initial ] .",
    "a determinantal presentation for the secant ideals @xmath409 is well known .",
    "namely , for each @xmath73 and @xmath4 with @xmath410 let @xmath411 denote the @xmath412 hankel matrix @xmath413 if @xmath414 then @xmath411 denotes the empty @xmath415 matrix .",
    "the concatenation @xmath416 is a matrix with @xmath163 rows and @xmath417 columns .",
    "we first reduce to the two dimensional case .",
    "this reduction is possible because a delightful triangulation of a polytope is delightful for any face , and the quadrangle @xmath423 appears as a face of the polytope @xmath424 .    to analyze the two dimensional case , we first must understand the full triangulations of the sets @xmath425 .",
    "each of these triangulations is lexicographic .",
    "the full triangulations of @xmath426 correspond to certain bipartite graphs .",
    "namely , aside from the edges like @xmath427 and @xmath428 , the remaining edges form a bipartite planar spanning tree in the complete bipartite graph @xmath429 .",
    "planar means that there is no pair of edges @xmath430 @xmath431 with @xmath305 and @xmath432 .",
    "an example of such a triangulation and the associated bipartite planar spanning tree appear in figure 3 .",
    "if a triangulation of a scroll is delightful , then the associated bipartite planar graph can not possess certain induced subgraphs .",
    "we claim that , up to symmetry , these forbidden induced subgraphs are the following two :      thus ( 1 ) is a claw @xmath441 which is not adjacent to a vertical boundary , and ( 2 ) is a claw @xmath442 which is adjacent to a vertical boundary .",
    "note that the triangulation in figure 3 contains both of these forbidden subgraphs .",
    "if the graph of a triangulation contains the @xmath441 in case ( 1 ) then the ideal @xmath443 contains the monomial @xmath444 . however , by virtue of the fact that the full triangulation can be chosen to be lexicographic with @xmath445 , @xmath446 and @xmath447 smaller than any other @xmath448 , and appealing to proposition [ prop : scrolldet ] , we see that this monomial can not be the leading monomial of any polynomial in @xmath449 . a similar argument rules out the subgraph @xmath442 in case ( 2 ) .",
    "to finish the proof , note that if @xmath450 and @xmath451 , then the induced graph of any full triangulation of @xmath452 must contain one of the two forbidden subgraphs ( or a subgraph symmetrically equivalent ) .",
    "the edge graph of every full triangulation of a configuration @xmath458 is a chordal graph .",
    "this can be proved by induction on @xmath459 .",
    "let @xmath460 be the complementary graph to that chordal graph .",
    "the initial ideal @xmath461 equals the edge ideal @xmath462 .",
    "since chordal graphs are perfect , and the complements of perfect graphs are perfect , it follows that @xmath460 is a perfect graph .    for the particular lexicographic term order we have chosen ,",
    "the edges in the graph @xmath460 are the pairs of the form @xmath463 such that @xmath464 or @xmath465 and @xmath305 .",
    "it is the simplicity of the graph @xmath460 which depends on @xmath466 for all @xmath73 and @xmath467 . to show that @xmath257 is delightful",
    ", we must show that for each clique of size @xmath4 in @xmath460 there is a polynomial in @xmath468 which has the clique as a leading term .",
    "let @xmath469 be such clique .",
    "we may suppose that @xmath470 .",
    "consider the @xmath471 matrix      by construction , the polynomial @xmath473 belongs to @xmath468 since it is one of the minors appearing in proposition [ prop : scrolldet ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 is not identically zero .",
    "the structure of @xmath249 implies that @xmath14 could be identically zero only if there were two identical columns in @xmath249 .",
    "this implies that there are indices @xmath400 and @xmath474 with @xmath475 such that @xmath476 and @xmath477 .",
    "but the conditions on the edges of @xmath460 make it impossible for there to be a lexicographically ordered clique in @xmath460 with these properties .",
    "furthermore , each indeterminate appearing in the matrix @xmath249 is a valid indeterminate in our polynomial ring .",
    "this follows because all the second indices , @xmath478 , lie between @xmath479 and @xmath480 .",
    "finally , the term order @xmath257 selects the main diagonal as the leading term .",
    "hence @xmath257 is delightful for @xmath408 .",
    "the ideal @xmath457 can be realized as the elimination ideal of @xmath482 where @xmath483 for all @xmath73 .",
    "the lexicographic ordering from theorem [ lemma : scrollsame ] realizes this elimination and thus the delightful property passes to this elimination ideal .",
    "we will prove the case @xmath486 .",
    "the case of @xmath487 follows by the elimination argument used in the proof of corollary [ cor : same1 ] , and the other two cases are proved in theorem [ lemma : scrollsame ] and corollary [ cor : same1 ] .",
    "now introduce the lexicographic term order @xmath257 , given by the rule @xmath488 @xmath489 we claim that this lexicographic term order is delightful for @xmath485 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath490 be an independent set in the triangulation corresponding to this term order , arranged in decreasing lexicographic order .",
    "since every full triangulation of @xmath491 is chordal and hence perfect , we must show that this independent set yields the initial term of a polynomial in @xmath492 . for a general pair of sequential elements in our independent set @xmath493",
    ", this happens if and only if either : @xmath494 and @xmath495 ; or @xmath496 , and @xmath497 ; or @xmath498 , and @xmath499 .",
    "the only exceptions to these rules come at the ends : we can not have the pairs @xmath500 or @xmath501 in an independent set .    now construct the matrix @xmath249 as in the proof of theorem [ lemma : scrollsame ] . our conditions on the sequence @xmath490 guarantee that all the entries in @xmath249 are valid indeterminates in our polynomial ring .",
    "furthermore , @xmath473 is not identically zero , and @xmath14 has leading term equal to @xmath502 .",
    "thus , the lexicographic term order @xmath257 is delightful .",
