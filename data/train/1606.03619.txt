    "the sole purpose of the letter at hand is to call attention to following fact , and its consequences : that in a wide family of one - particle one - dimensional models , the ground state can be modified in a dramatic way with only a negligible perturbation in the potential . stated in more precise terms ,",
    "in the following pages it will be shown that for any @xmath0 and any @xmath1 there exists a family @xmath2 of analytic potentials , with analytic square - integrable ground eigensolutions @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 and that there exists @xmath6 such that @xmath7}{q[\\psi^{(\\epsilon , m,\\beta_{m})}]}>m \\quad , \\ ] ] with quotient @xmath8 defined as @xmath9=\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty}[f(x)]^{2}dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}[f(x)]^{2}dx}\\ ] ] for any square - integrable @xmath10",
    ".    stated in more physical terms , the content of the letter reduces to the following observation : when the stationary ground state @xmath11 of a system can be seen to be the coherent superposition of two states : @xmath12 the coefficients @xmath13 can be changed almost at whim , giving rise to a large asymmetry in the probability distribution , _ if _ the overlap between this two states is small , and a particular instance of this occurs _ when _ the distance between the expected positions @xmath14 and @xmath15 is large compared with both the @xmath16-variance of @xmath17 and that of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , an increase in the typical lengths of a system with a ground state conforming to ( [ i.05 ] ) would make this ground state even more sensitive to perturbations in the potential .",
    "granted , usual perturbation theory seems to disprove our main result , stated above .",
    "but this only because in this standard procedure first order perturbations in the potential are postulated and then first or higher order perturbations in the energy levels and stationary solutions are deduced . indeed , according to d.",
    "bohm usual perturbation theory rests on the assumption that a small change in the potential can only bring a small change in the solutions @xcite .",
    "an assumption we claim is not generally true , giving our results as a counterexample .",
    "the rest of the letter is organized as follows : in section 2 we lay out our main result and in section 3 we illustrated it with examples .",
    "then , some plausible consequences of this result are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we lay out tentative conclusions .",
    "in the following pages we will be mainly concerned with an equation of the type : @xmath19 for which    a.   the _ potential _ @xmath20 is analytic in @xmath21 and b.   the eigensolution @xmath22 is positive - definite , i e. @xmath23 and square - integrable , i. e. @xmath24    * definition .",
    "* @xmath25 shall designate for us the set of all functions @xmath26 complying with equation ( [ gro ] ) and conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) stated above .",
    "* definition .",
    "* in the following we will designate by @xmath27 the set of all analytic functions @xmath28 which are positive - definite and square - integrable .",
    "* equation ( [ gro ] ) has the form of a one - dimensional schrdinger stationary equation for the energy eigenvalue @xmath29 .",
    "condition ( [ pd ] ) implies that @xmath11 is _ nodeless _ and is thus the ground eigensolution of potential @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath30 of equation ( [ gro ] ) has ground eigenenergy @xmath31 . in so many words : @xmath25 is ( save for multiplicative factors of the type @xmath32 ) the set of all analytic potentials @xmath26 with ground energy eigenvalue @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , for each analytic @xmath33 with a ground eigenvalue @xmath34 there is a function @xmath35 with the same eigensolutions as @xmath36 .",
    "thus , any potential analytic on the line will have a ground - level square - integrable eigensolution @xmath37 and a properly normalized ground - level eigensolution @xmath38 ( that is a @xmath39 complying with @xmath40 if it admits bounded states at all .",
    "* definition .",
    "* in the following @xmath41 will stand for the set of all properly normalized functions in @xmath27 .",
    "there exists a surjective mapping @xmath42 such that :    * for every @xmath37 there is one and only one @xmath43 for which ( [ gro ] ) is verified ( the prime standing for the @xmath16-derivative ) and * the restriction @xmath44 is invertible .",
    "as every @xmath37 is analytic and positive - definite in @xmath21 , then @xmath45(x)=\\frac{\\psi^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{\\psi ( x)}\\ ] ] is a well defined expression for all @xmath46 , and by making @xmath47 equation ( [ gro ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "thus , the mapping exists .",

    "this first example was chosen so that the parity symmetry of an _ unpertubed _ potential ( the case for @xmath177 ) was broken by small asymmetric perturbations .",
    "our next and last example ( which we will not work out in full ) shows how the sensitivity of the ground eigensolution can appear even when parity is absent from the unperturbed case .",
    "indeed , just consider the convex linear combinations of the form @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a ground eigensolution of the hyperbolic rosen - morse potential : @xmath180 as can be checked by direct substitution .",
    "clearly , no combination of values of @xmath115 , @xmath164 and @xmath96 can make ground eigensolution ( [ ex.12 ] ) ( and thus its potential ) symmetric .",
    "yet , by now it should be clear that the behaviour of the potentials and ground eigenstates is very similar to the one in the previous example : in both cases each potential in the family consists of two wells separated by a certain distance .",
    "the sensitivity of the ground eigensolutions depends not on the exact details of each potential but rather on the separation between the wells . for bigger distances ,",
    "each small change in the relative strength between the wells entails an inordinate change in the probability of finding the particle in one or the other well .",
    "we note in passing that other , more toilsome examples can be worked out starting from different convex linear combinations of hyperbolic scarf , hyperbolic rosen - morse and other exactly solvable bounded potentials .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity of the ground eigenfunction can be shown to exist even without any knowledge of the excited spectra , just by judiciously choosing functions @xmath54 with bounded @xmath181 potentials .",
    "lemma 4 shows us that there is nothing inherently pathological about the type of potentials under consideration in his letter : every ground eigensolution can be written as the convex linear combination of two different square - integrable functions ( even if this latter functions bear , in most instances , no physical meaning at all ) and every potential with ( an at least ) partially bounded spectrum can be seen to be part of one of our @xmath182 families .",
    "we thus consider that the arguments laid out in the previous pages show in a cogent manner that non - relativistic quantum theory does not disavow the possibility of systems endowed with ground eigensolutions that are extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the potential .",
    "moreover , the analyticity of the potential , and the very stern condition ( [ i.02 ] ) can be relaxed in order to obtain more general versions of our main result .",
    "indeed , the only truly indispensable condition for the extreme sensitivity of the grounds eigensolution seems to be the existence of two wells separated by a distance that is in some sense large .",
    "consequence of the above , we believe it is reasonable to consider that a version of the effect just described may be at play whenever an experiment shows the existence of a large , unexplained asymmetry in a distribution probability . thus , for example , when considering the self - trapping phenomena occurring bose - einstein condensates @xcite , it may be worthwhile to investigate if the ( admittedly non - linear ) gross - pitaevskii equation governing this systems admits non - standard perturbations similar to the ones expounded in the previous pages . if this were to be true , then uncontrollable small perturbations in the confining potential may enhance the self - trapping phenomenon . in a similar vein",
    ", we conjecture that small asymmetries in the composition profile may play a role in the observed accumulation of localized electrons in quantum well heterostructures composed of narrow - gap semiconductors@xcite .",
    "we consider that discussing other possible implications of the results just expounded would be both premature and highly speculative at this stage .",
    "finally , we have to mention two factors that could hinder the experimental detection of the extreme sensitivity we have been alluding to .",
    "the first of this is the mingling of the ground and first excited state into an effective two level system .",
    "indeed , in the type of double - well potentials under discussion , the first excited eigensolution , @xmath183 , can always be approximated @xcite by @xmath184 and as their overlap diminishes , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 become the _ increasingly independent _",
    "( so to speak ) solutions of a low - laying two - level system .",
    "the second hindrance we have mentioned stems from the scaling of the potentials given by equation ( [ r102 ] ) , which indicates that sensitivity is favored by _",
    "particles , i. e. particles with small expected values of kinetic energy .",
    "in the preceding pages we have shown that the non - relativistic quantum theory of structureless particles moving on the line admits the existence of stationary perturbations differing from the standard type .",
    "our models predict the existence of dramatic changes in the ground probability density with only minor perturbations in the potential , when this potential is bounded and consists in two wells separated by a distance large enough as to make the overlap between the independent well solutions negligible .",
    "this is a falsifiable prediction stemming only from text - book non - relativistic quantum theory that may have implications for condensed matter physics and possibly other fields .",
