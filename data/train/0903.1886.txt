    "growing attention has recently been paid to the transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions also called the unintegrated parton distributions @xcite .",
    "the reason of particular interest stems from the fact that they play important roles in the theoretical description of single spin asymmetries in various hard processes including semi - inclusive deep inelastic scatterings , drell - yan processes , etc . @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the tmd parton distributions are interesting themselves also from more general viewpoint .",
    "they are expected to give a three - dimensional view of the parton distributions in momentum space , thereby providing us with complementary information besides what can be obtained through generalized parton distributions @xcite -@xcite .",
    "it has been established that at the leading twist there are totally eight tmd parton distributions @xcite -@xcite . among those ,",
    "six are even under naive time - reversal transformations ( for brevity , we call it t - even ) , while the remaining two are t - odd @xcite-@xcite . to meet the general requirement of factorization and gauge - invariance , these tmd parton distributions",
    "must be defined with the gauge link operators called wilson lines @xcite -@xcite . since these wilson lines , which can be interpreted as simulating the effects of gluon initial and final state interactions , are process dependent @xcite , the tmd parton distributions are in general non - universal @xcite,@xcite .",
    "still , a remarkable difference between the t - even and t - odd tmd parton distributions should not be overlooked . for the former , the presence of the wilson lines is less crucial in the sense that they _ do _ survive even without such gauge links . on the contrary , for the t - odd tmd parton distributions ,",
    "the introduction of the wilson lines is of fatal importance since they _ do _ vanish identically in the absence of such effects of initial and final state interactions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the existence of the former types of tmd distributions appears only natural since the intrinsic motion of quarks described by the naive bound state wave function without any complex phase is likely to be three dimensional and it should be described by some tmd distribution function .    unlike the integrated parton distributions ,",
    "our knowledge on the tmd parton distributions is very poor .",
    "very recently , through the analysis of azimuthal asymmetries both in hadron - hadron collisions and in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scatterings , anselmino et al . extracted a t - odd tmd distribution @xmath3 called the sivers function @xcite .",
    "there also exists an attempt to extract another t - odd distribution called the boer - mulders function @xcite . in these studies , however , a flavor independent gaussian distribution of the transverse momentum under the factorized ansatz in the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 is assumed by reason of simplicity , although there is no compelling reason for this choice . since enough empirical information to test such assumption can not be expected at the present moment , any information from models of baryons and/or the lattice qcd would be extremely valuable .",
    "although there exist a lot of model calculations for the integrated parton distributions , there are not so many for the tmd distributions .",
    "( see @xcite for a compact overview of those studies . )",
    "the leading - twist t - even functions were calculated in a spectator model with scalar and axial - vector quarks @xcite , and in a light - cone quark model where the fock expansion is truncated to consider only 3 valence quarks @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the t - odd functions are investigated in the spectator model with scalar diquarks @xcite,@xcite and with scalar and axial - vector diquarks @xcite , @xcite,@xcite in the mit bag model @xcite -@xcite , and in the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "very recently , the first lattice qcd calculation of the lowest moments of the tmd quark distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 has also been reported @xcite .",
    "( although our main interest here is concerned with the tmd quark distributions inside the nucleon , we recall that there also exist some investigations on the tmd distributions in the pseudoscalar mesons including the pion based on the su(3 ) nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite -@xcite . )",
    "now , the purpose of the present paper is to evaluate the simplest but most fundamental tmd parton distributions in the nucleon , i.e. the t - even unpolarized tmd quark and antiquark distributions with isoscalar combination , within the framework of the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the greatest advantage of the cqsm over the other models of baryons is its full account of nonperturbative chiral dynamics of qcd , which has been proven to be essential for the physics of light quark distribution functions @xcite -@xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative account of the deformed dirac - sea quarks within the scheme enables us to make a reliable predictions not only for the quark distributions but also for the antiquark distributions , as already been proven through its good reproduction of the famous nmc ( new muon collaboration ) observation , i.e. the dominance of the @xmath6 sea over the @xmath7 one in the proton , etc .",
    "we therefore expect that the same model would provide us with valuable and reliable information also on the nature of the transverse motion of quarks and antiquarks inside the nucleon .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in sect.ii , we derive theoretical formulas necessary for the calculation of the tmd quark and antiquark distributions within the framework of the cqsm .",
    "next , in sect.iii , the predictions of the cqsm are shown and the detailed discussion on them will be given .",
    "conclusion of our analysis is then given in sect.iv .",
    "we are interested here in the simplest but most fundamental tmd parton distribution function , i.e. the unpolarized tmd quark distribution .",
    "the unpolarized tmd quark distribution function of flavor @xmath8 in the nucleon , averaged over its spin , is defined as @xmath9 } \\,\\psi_a ( \\xi ) \\,|",
    "\\,p \\rangle \\ ,   \\right|_{\\xi^+ = 0 } , \\label{eq : tmdpdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 } \\",
    "\\equiv \\ { \\cal p } \\ ,   e^{- \\,i \\,g \\,\\int_0^\\xi \\,a ( w ) \\cdot d w } , \\ ] ] is the so - called gauge link operator , also called wilson line , connecting the two different space - time points @xmath11 and @xmath12 , by all possible ordered path .",
    "this gauge link is known to simulate the interaction of the outgoing quark field with the spectators inside the hadron , and it works to ensure the color gauge invariance of the above definition of the tmd quark distribution @xcite .    here , we want to evaluate the tmd quark distribution within the framework of the cqsm .",
    "since the cqsm is an effective quark theory , which does not contain gluonic degrees of freedom at least explicitly , we can drop the gauge link operator . as a matter of course",
    ", this simple procedure is fatal for predicting the t - odd tmd distributions like the sivers function @xcite,@xcite or the boer - mulders function @xcite , since the complex phase arising from the gauge link is indispensable for the existence of such t - odd distribution functions . roughly speaking , the t - even distribution function we are to calculate below can be thought of as a `` static '' tmd quark distribution , which can be computed directly from the bound state wave functions of a target nucleon without accompanying complex phase arising from the effects of final state interactions @xcite .",
    "though the definition ( [ eq : tmdpdf ] ) of the tmd distribution function itself is lorentz - frame independent , it is convenient to evaluate it in the nucleon rest frame , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the nucleon mass .",
    "this enables us to rewrite the exponential factor @xmath16 contained in ( [ eq : tmdpdf ] ) in the following manner : @xmath17 here , we have used the relation @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) , together with the standard definition of the light - cone vector , @xmath20 .    to proceed further ,",
    "we notice that the large-@xmath21 behavior of the unpolarized tmd quark distribution depends on the isospin combination @xcite . just similarly to the integrated unpolarized distributions extensively studied before @xcite-@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , the isoscalar distribution is dominant in the large-@xmath21 limit , and survives at the mean - field level , while the isovector combination appears as the first order correction in the collective angular velocity operator @xmath22 of the rotating soliton .",
    "( we recall that @xmath22 is an @xmath23 quantity . )",
    "since the evaluation of the @xmath24 contribution is much harder , let us concentrate on the calculation of the isoscalar part in the present paper . using the formalism developed in the previous studies @xcite -@xcite",
    ", we find that the isoscalar unpolarized tmd quark distribution @xmath25 in the cqsm is given in the following form : @xmath26 with @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the eigenfunctions of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath29 with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 with @xmath32 in ( [ eq : tmdpdf_cqsm_1 ] ) , @xmath33 denotes the summation over the occupied states in the hedgehog mean field . in deriving ( [ eq : tmdpdf_cqsm_1 ] ) , the projection into a nucleon state with given momenta @xmath34 has been achieved , as usual , by integrating over all shift of the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath35 of the soliton , @xmath36 introducing the eigenfunctions in the momentum representation , @xmath37 ( [ eq : tmdpdf_cqsm_1 ] ) can readily be transformed into the form : @xmath38 now , by noting that @xmath39 , one can carry out the integration over @xmath40 and @xmath41 to obtain @xmath42 as usual , the numerical evaluation of the above expression is carried out by using the discretized momentum basis of kahana and ripka @xcite,@xcite , so that it is convenient to introduce the smeared distribution defined by @xcite @xmath43 after some straightforward algebra , we therefore get @xmath44 here , we have changed the integration variable from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "we recall now that @xmath47 is simultaneous eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath29 , and the grand spin operator @xmath48 and its projection @xmath49 on the @xmath50-axis .",
    "the functions @xmath47 can be expanded in terms of the discretized plane - wave basis of kahana and ripka as @xmath51 where the index @xmath52 distinguishes 4 independent plane - wave basis with definite grand spin @xmath53 , and parity .",
    "( we point out that the expansion coefficients @xmath54 can be chosen real numbers . ) on the other hand , @xmath55 labels the discretized momenta @xmath56 , which is determined by imposing the boundary condition @xmath57 at the radius @xmath58 chosen to be sufficiently larger than the typical soliton size .",
    "( the number of momentum bases is made finite by introducing the maximum momentum @xmath59 such that @xmath60 . ) since the kahana - ripka plane - wave basis is given in the spherical representation , we also express @xmath61 and @xmath46 in the spherical coordinates as @xmath62 since the final answer for the tmd distribution @xmath25 should be independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath63 of the transverse momentum @xmath61 , the following replacement is justified @xmath64 the result of @xmath63 integration can schematically be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a function of @xmath56 and @xmath67 .",
    "the kronecker delta @xmath68 arises from the fact that the operator @xmath69 does not change momentum .",
    "because the magnitude of the transverse momentum @xmath70 is given externally , the relations ( [ eq : spherical_x])-([eq : spherical_z ] ) dictates that , once the plane - wave - basis momentum @xmath56 is given , both of @xmath46 and @xmath67 are fixed as @xmath71 we therefore approximate the expression ( [ eq : tmdpdf_smear ] ) as @xmath72 in the next section , we show that this algorithm in fact works if we take large enough boundary radius @xmath73 , at least for the calculation of dirac sea contributions .",
    "unfortunately , we find that the same algorithm does not work very well for the calculation of the discrete valence level contribution ( corresponding to @xmath74 ) .",
    "this causes no serious problem , however , since we can use simpler method to evaluate this part .",
    "we just go back to the expression ( [ eq : tmdpdf_cqsm_2 ] ) before introducing smeared distribution , and obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the eigenfunction and the eigenenergy corresponding the valence level . since @xmath76 is a discrete bound state wave function anyhow",
    ", we can evaluate the above expression without any difficulty by using its momentum space wave function as used in @xcite .",
    "the basic lagrangian of the model contains two physical parameters , the weak pion decay constant @xmath78 , the dynamically generated effective quark mass @xmath79 . as usual , @xmath78 is fixed to be its physical value , i.e. @xmath80 . on the other hand , @xmath79 is taken to be @xmath81 , which is favored from our previous analysis of the nucleon spin structure functions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the model contains ultraviolet divergences so that it must be regularized by introducing some physical cutoff . following the previous studies",
    ", we simply use the pauli - villars regularization scheme with single subtraction . in this scheme",
    ", any nucleon observables including quark distribution functions in the nucleon are regularized through the subtraction @xcite : @xmath82 here @xmath83 denotes the nucleon matrix element of an operator @xmath84 evaluated with the original effective action with the mass parameter @xmath79 , while @xmath85 stands for the corresponding matrix element obtained from @xmath83 by replacing the parameter @xmath79 with the pauli - villars cutoff mass @xmath86 . demanding that the regularized action reproduces the correct normalization of pion kinetic term in the corresponding bosonized action",
    ", @xmath86 is uniquely fixed by the relation @xmath87 for @xmath88 , this gives @xmath89 , leaving no adjustable parameter .",
    "a short comment may be necessary for the regularization scheme explained above . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the pauli - villars scheme with a single subtraction term is not a completely satisfactory regularization procedure .",
    "it fails to remove ultraviolet divergences of some special quantities like the vacuum quark condensate , which contains quadratic divergence instead of logarithmic one . for obtaining finite answers",
    "also for these special observables , the single - subtraction pauli - villars scheme is not enough .",
    "it was shown that more sophisticated pauli - villars scheme with two subtraction terms meets this requirement @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the self - consistent solution of the cqsm obtained in this double - subtraction pauli - villars scheme is only slightly different from that of the naive single - subtraction scheme , except when dealing with some special quantities containing quadratic divergences @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that the calculation of quark distribution functions , much more the tmd quark distribution functions , in the cqsm , is extremely time - consuming and that the most nucleon observables are rather insensitive to which regularization scheme is chosen , we shall simply use here the single - subtraction pauli - villars scheme .",
    "( the use of more time - consuming double subtraction scheme is mandatory , however , for some special parton distribution functions containing quadratic divergences .",
    "an example is the chiral - odd twist-3 unpolarized distribution functions @xmath90 investigated in @xcite -@xcite . )     for two typical values of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath91 ( left panel ) , and @xmath92 ( right panel ) . in both figures , the dashed curves represent the bare numerical predictions of the model obtained with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , while the solid curves are their smooth fits .",

    "we fit these results with smooth function shown by solid curves .    after demonstrating that our numerical method in fact works as",

    "an importance notice here is that the total contributions shown by the solid curves are all negative for any @xmath1 .",
    "in consideration of the extra minus sign indicated in ( [ eq : negative_x ] ) , this means that the _ positivity _ of the tmd antiquark distribution @xmath115 is legitimately fulfilled in the cqsm .",
    "we emphasize that the proper inclusion of the dirac - sea contribution is crucial for the fulfillment of this fundamental property of unpolarized parton distribution .",

    ", the analysis above indicates that the frequently used assumption of factorization in @xmath1 and @xmath2 is most probably violated .",
    "later , this statement can be made a little more quantitative through the investigation of the average transverse momentum square of quarks and antiquarks in dependence of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 .",
    "but , before doing it , here demonstrate realistic nature of the predictions of the cqsm , through the analysis of the empirically well - known integrated quark and antiquark distributions , the information of which is hidden in the tmd distribution @xmath25 .     with isoscalar combination obtained from the corresponding tmd distribution via ( [ eq : integ ] )",

    "second , the test of factorization is far from persuasive , since the evaluation of full @xmath1-dependence is beyond the scope of the presently - known algorithms of lattice qcd .    turning back to the @xmath1-dependence of the average transverse momentum square of quarks and antiquarks",
    ", we continue to analyze the prediction of the cqsm .",
    "let us first look into the positive @xmath1 region corresponding to the quark distribution .",
    "very strangely , the average transverse momentum square has a minimum around @xmath141 , and it increases as @xmath1 becomes larger .",
    "this feature can be understood as follows .",
    "around @xmath142 , the integrated quark distribution @xmath108 has a peak , which is dominated by the contribution of the valence - level quarks .",
    "this means that the relative importance of dirac - sea quarks , which has higher @xmath2 components , as compared to the valence - level quark , is smallest around there , which explains the above - mentioned feature of @xmath136 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "one may also notice that the average transverse momentum square around @xmath143 is fairly large , which indicates that the quarks ( and antiquarks ) with small longitudinal momentum fraction would carry sizable amount of orbital angular momentum along the @xmath50-axis , i.e. along the the direction of nucleon spin .",
    "we recall that this observation is consistent with the results of @xcite , in which a direct calculation of quark orbital - angular - momentum distributions was carried out .",
    "( see also the analyses of the quark orbital angular momentum from the viewpoint of the generalized parton distribution functions @xcite -@xcite . )",
    "another unique feature of the cqsm prediction is that the magnitude @xmath136 is much larger in the negative @xmath1 region , corresponding to the antiquarks .",
    "another way of convincing this feature is to compare the two quantities defined below : @xmath144 which represent the average transverse momentum square for quarks and antiquarks , respectively .",
    "numerically , we find that @xmath145 which clearly shows that the average transverse momentum of antiquarks is much larger than that of quarks",
    ". we can also estimate the average transverse momentum square of quarks and antiquarks altogether from @xmath146 which gives @xmath147 this value of average transverse momentum square is remarkably close to that used in the phenomenological analysis of the semi - inclusive reactions @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the average transverse momentum is a scale dependent quantity , which is believed to grow as @xmath148 increases .",
    "the predictions of the cqsm corresponds to the scale @xmath149 @xcite,@xcite , while the phenomenological analysis in @xcite should correspond to somewhat higher energy scale . in any phenomenological analysis",
    ", one must keep in mind this scale dependent nature of the average transverse momentum square of quarks and antiquarks .    before ending this section , we make a short comment on the so - called transverse - coordinate representation of the tmd parton distributions .",
    "the @xmath148-evolution of the tmd parton distributions or the unintegrated parton distributions is described by the catani - ciafaloni - fiorani - marchesini ( ccfm ) equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a nice feature of the ccfm equation at the leading order is that they reproduce the convectional leading - order dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations for the integrated distributions .",
    "the ccfm equations are known to take a particularly simple structure if one introduces the so - called transverse - coordinate representation of the parton distributions @xcite -@xcite . to explain it",
    ", we represent below the tmd quark ( or antiquark ) distribution of flavor @xmath8 as @xmath150 with @xmath151 , where the dependence on the scale @xmath148 is also shown explicitly .",
    "the transverse - coordinate representation @xmath152 of a quark ( or an antiquark ) of flavor @xmath153 is introduced as the two - dimensional fourier transform of the corresponding tmd distribution @xmath150 : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the transverse coordinate vector .",
    "clearly , at @xmath156 , the function @xmath152 reduces to the familiar integrated distribution @xmath157 .",
    "the greatest advantage of using the transverse - coordinate representation is that the corresponding evolution equations for the unintegrated distributions , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , become diagonal in the transverse coordinate @xmath160 . here , just for illustration",
    ", we show the evolution equation for the nonsinglet ( ns ) distribution .",
    "it takes the form @xcite,@xcite : @xmath161 \\ ,   \\bar{f}_{ns } \\left ( \\frac{x}{z } , b , q^2 \\right ) \\ - \\    \\bar{f}_{ns } ( x , b , q^2 ) \\,\\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which certainly is diagonal in the variable @xmath160 .",
    "once these evolution equations are solved in a similar way as the standard dglap equations , the average transverse momentum square for a given distribution at any @xmath148 can be evaluated from @xmath162 the transverse - coordinate representation of the unintegrated parton distribution discussed above should not be confused with more popular impact - parameter dependent parton distributions introduced by burkardt @xcite , although there should be strong correlation between them .",
    "the simplest impact - parameter dependent parton distribution function @xmath163 is the two dimensional fourier transform of the unpolarized generalized parton distribution function @xmath164 with zero skewdness parameter @xmath165 : @xmath166 we recall that the frequently used parametrization @xcite of @xmath167 is of non - factorizable form in @xmath1 and @xmath168 as @xmath169 , \\ ] ] with @xmath170 \\ ,   ( 1 - x)^3 \\ + \\ a_a \\,x \\,(1 - x)^2 , \\ ] ] which means that @xmath163 is also non - factorizable in @xmath1 and @xmath171 .",
    "this in turn strongly indicates that the transverse - coordinate representation of the unintegrated parton distributions , and consequently , the tmd parton distributions are most likely to be non - factorizable in the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as our predictions based on the cqsm shows explicitly .",
    "to conclude , we have reported the first calculation of the simplest but most fundamental tmd parton distribution in the nucleon , i.e. the unpolarized tmd quark and antiquark distributions with isoscalar combination , within the framework of the cqsm .",
    "the realistic nature of the cqsm predictions was demonstrated by showing that the integrated unpolarized distribution @xmath120 , obtained from the corresponding tmd distribution @xmath25 , is consistent with the available empirical information on the light - flavor unpolarized parton distributions .",
    "it was found that the predicted average transverse momentum square of quarks and antiquarks depends strongly on their longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 .",
    "we also estimate the average transverse momentum of quarks and antiquarks separately to find , somewhat unexpectedly , that @xmath172 and @xmath173 , that is , the antiquarks have much higher average transverse momentum than the quarks . on the other hand",
    ", the average momentum transfer of quarks and antiquarks altogether turns out to be @xmath174 , which is order of magnitude consistent with the recent phenomenological analysis , although we must be careful about the fact that the average transverse momentum square is a @xmath148-dependent quantity .",
