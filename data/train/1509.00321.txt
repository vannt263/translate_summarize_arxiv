    "the notion of restricting unfoldings of convex polyhedra by following a hamiltonian path along polyhedron edges was introduced by shephard 40 years ago  @xcite .",
    "shepard noted that not every polyhedron has such a hamiltonian edge - unfolding , because not every polyhedron @xmath7-skeleton has a hamiltonian path ( e.g. , the rhombic dodecahedron does not have such a path ) .",

    "http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke / spiralunf/. ]    [ fig : icosaf35 ]      [ sec : bands ] we return to the definition of a spiral , to make precise the sense in which the spiral must always advance ccw around the polyhedron @xmath1 .",
    "let a _ band _",
    "be the portion of @xmath1 between two horizontal ( @xmath22 ) planes , such that there is no vertex of @xmath1 strictly between the planes ( although vertices may lie on those planes ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig : band3d ] .",
    "the edges of @xmath1 crossing the band provide a natural combinatorial sense of ccw .",
    "if a segment @xmath20 of @xmath0 connects two edges of a band , then it is ccw if the second edge is ccw of the first edge ( recall our convention that the spiral rises from a bottom to a top vertex ) . in general , and in all examples in this paper , each @xmath14 does in fact lie on an edge ( or several , where they meet at a vertex ) .",
    "however , this is not a necessary condition : @xmath14 could lie interior to a face .",
    "if @xmath20 does not connect two band edges ( e.g. , both @xmath14 and @xmath13 might be vertices connected by an edge of @xmath1 ) , then the following rule is used to determine whether it represents a ccw advance .",

    "[ fig : slicesbandpath ]    these two planes define a vertex - free band @xmath32 .",
    "the algorithm takes a parameter @xmath33 indicating how many complete times @xmath0 should wind around @xmath32 before connecting to @xmath29 . in the figure , @xmath34 , so the connection is as direct as possible . in this instance",

    ". therefore @xmath0 spirals across several edges of @xmath1 before reaching @xmath29 .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath0 can not follow a geodesic as it winds around the band , as the shape of a band would only allow that in special circumstances ..    the top and bottom vertices are handled specially . because our goal is to avoid overlap , and overlap usually occurs at these apexes when acute angles are forced , the first segment from the bottom vertex @xmath36 , to @xmath37 , is selected to make a nonacute turn to connect to @xmath37 .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure  [ fig : cube3d ] , where a @xmath11 turn is selected , and in other figures .",

    "of course the turn at @xmath37 to connect to @xmath38 might be highly acute , often leading to overlap ( e.g. , in figure  [ fig : dodecaoverlap ] ) .    because the algorithm progresses from the bottom vertex to the top without look - ahead , it is possible that the details of the connection to the top vertex are not identical to the details at the bottom vertex , even when @xmath1 is symmetric .",
