    "it has exactly the form expected for a griffiths phase , where the exponent characterizing the local energy scale distribution assumes a parameter - dependent ( tunable ) form .    to show how the nfl behavior appears due to the singularity in @xmath0 , we use the standard expression due to wilson for the magnetic susceptibility@xcite@xmath49 which is an excellent approximation for a single kondo impurity . here",

    "the exponent @xmath56 is large and the distribution @xmath0 is regular , @xmath57 , but nfl behavior emerges once @xmath58 , which corresponds to @xmath59 for @xmath60 the magnetic susceptibility has a logarithmic divergence , @xmath61 , characteristic of marginal fermi liquid behavior,@xcite while for @xmath62 a power law divergence is obtained , @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "the same singularity also leads to an anomalous behavior in the transport properties , as shown in detail in refs .   and .",
    "in the above derivation we ignored the fact that the conduction bath @xmath19 has to be self - consistently determined .",
    "this will also produce particle - hole asymmetry and an asymmetric distribution of kondo temperatures @xmath65 .",
    "a nonzero chemical potential will further increase this asymmetry .",
    "however , the numerical solution we obtained using the slave boson approximation at zero temperature shows that the essential physics described by eqs .",
    "( [ 3.3])-([3.6 ] ) remains qualitatively correct .",
    "the distribution of local kondo temperatures in the asymptotic limit is indeed a power law , @xmath66 , where the exponent @xmath56 is a decreasing function of disorder .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the distribution @xmath0 for several values of the disorder distribution strength @xmath4 . for the parameters that we here use ,",
    "the system is close to the kondo limit , and the kondo gap of the clean system is approximately 0.04 ( in energy units of the half bandwidth of bare dos ) .",
    "the nfl behavior appears for @xmath67 .",
    "we note that in the nfl regime the power law behavior appears already for the site energies @xmath68 which deviate only moderately from the mean ( zero ) value . in other words ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior is established _",
    "well before _",
    "we attain very rare realizations of @xmath68 which belong to the tail of the gaussian distribution .",
    "for example , for @xmath69 , sites with @xmath70 ( which correspond to @xmath71 ) are already in the power - law regime .    according to the simplified derivation from sec  [ sec : analytical - solution ] , the exponent @xmath56 is inversely proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "the numerical results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] confirm such behavior for weak and moderate disorder . for strong disorder",
    "there appear some deviations from this formula , which can be ascribed to the dependence of the dos at the fermi level on the disorder strength .    before we present arguments which justify our effective dmft model approach , let us make a direct comparison with the _ _ stat__dmft results from ref .  .",
    "in this approach , very broad distributions of local kondo temperatures are generated for _ arbitrary _ distributions of bare disorder .",
    "in particular , even if the bare distribution is bounded , sites with arbitrarily small kondo temperatures will exist , and their distribution will have a power law tail .",
    "this is a consequence of the spatial fluctuations of the conduction electron cavity field , as we discuss in detail in the next section . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the values of the exponent @xmath56 for the effective model with gaussian disorder of variance @xmath73 , and the _ _ stat__dmft results obtained for a _ bounded _ uniform distribution of bare disorder with the same variance .",
    "remarkably , not only does the electronic griffiths phase emerge in the same fashion , but the numerical values of disorder strength determining the onset of nfl behavior are also almost the same .",
    "the comparison is made for two different values of the chemical potential .",
    "as we move further away from half - filling by changing the chemical potential , the critical value @xmath5 decreases .",
    "that is expected since @xmath56 should be proportional to the bare ( noninteracting ) dos at the fermi level .",
    "in this section we explain the universal aspects of the emergence of the electronic griffiths phase within the more generic statistical dmft .",
    "in particular , we show how the gaussian tails in the distribution of renormalized disorder appear for an arbitrary form of the bare disorder .",
    "moreover , we present arguments showing that the griffiths phase appears generically as a precursor of the mott - anderson metal - insulator transition .      in the above dmft formulation , we had to choose a special form of disorder distribution in order to obtain the desired power - law distribution of kondo temperatures .",
    "had we chosen a different distribution , the results would not have held .",
    "for example , for a bounded distribution of site energies , there would always be a minimum value of the kondo temperature , and thus no power - law tail .",
    "on the other hand , from numerical simulations of lattices with finite coordination , it has been established that the emergence of the griffiths phase is a universal phenomenon.@xcite why ? to understand the reason for this , we note that for finite coordination ( as opposed to the dmft limit ) the cavity bath @xmath19 is not self - averaging , but is a site - dependent , random quantity @xmath74 . in this _",
    "_ stat__dmft formulation , the local conduction electron green s function is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 describes the local scattering of the conduction electrons off the @xmath11-shell at site @xmath16 , and is given as before by eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) .    for weak disorder ,",
    "the corresponding fluctuations are small , and we can separate @xmath77 in the following , we compute the distribution function for the fluctuations of the cavity field , which will lead to the renormalized form of the disorder distribution function . the renormalized site energies can be defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 $ ] . we stress that the cavity fluctuations are present for a general finite coordination electronic system in the presence of disorder of any kind . in particular , the disorder in hybridization parameters @xmath80 , or local @xmath11-energy levels @xmath81 , will induce fluctuations in the local dos even if random site energies @xmath68 in the conduction band are absent . furthermore , as we argue in the next subsection , the renormalized distribution @xmath82 will have universal gaussian tails even if the bare distribution @xmath83 is bounded .",
    "note that @xmath84 has a real as well as an imaginary part @xmath85 , due to the fact that fluctuations locally violate particle - hole symmetry .",
    "however , we show in the appendix that @xmath85 fluctuations , at least when treated to leading order , do not produce singular behavior in @xmath0 and therefore can be neglected when examining the emergence of the electronic griffiths phase .      from detailed numerical studies",
    "it has become clear that the onset of the griffiths phase in disordered anderson lattices generally occurs already for a relatively moderate amount of disorder . in this limit",
    ", the relevant distributions are determined essentially by the central limit theorem , therefore resulting in a gaussian form of the tails for @xmath82 .",
    "this is precisely what is needed to justify the dmft effective model , where such gaussian tails are assumed from the outset .    before engaging in more precise computations of these distributions ,",
    "it is worth pausing to comment on the physical validity of the assumed gaussian statistics , i.e. the relevance of the central limit theorem in the cases of interest . quite generally ,",
    "if a certain quantity can be represented as a sum of a large number of independent random variables , then the central limit theorem tells us that the resulting distribution will be gaussian , irrespective of the specific form of the distributions of the individual terms in the sum . in our case , the fluctuations of the local cavity field result from friedel oscillations of the electronic wave functions , induced by other impurities which may lie at a relatively long distance from the given site . this is a result of the slow ( @xmath86 ) decay of the amplitude of the friedel oscillations in @xmath87 dimensions , where @xmath88 is the distance from the impurity site",
    "the situation is very reminiscent of the weiss molecular field of an itinerant magnet , where the rkky spin - spin interactions have a long range character for the very same reason , being as they are a reflection of similar friedel oscillations .",
    "furthermore , as we will explicitly show , the leading corrections ( to order @xmath89 ) at weak disorder take the form of a linear superposition of contributions from single impurity scatterers , and thus of a sum of independent random numbers , for which we expect the central limit theorem to hold .    to obtain the precise form of this distribution",
    ", it therefore suffices to compute the variance @xmath90 to leading order in disorder strength . to compute the fluctuations @xmath84 at weak disorder",
    ", we note that the cavity field @xmath74 can be computed if we consider a particular site with @xmath45 ( call it site @xmath91 ) , and compute its green s function in a random medium . at zero frequency for this site",
    "@xmath92 the corresponding variation is @xmath93 we still need to compute the fluctuation @xmath94 which can be expanded in powers of the random potential @xmath68 . in doing this",
    ", we have ignored the interaction renormalizations of the random potential for conduction electrons .",
    "we will return to re - examine this effect in the appendix .",
    "note , however , that in the absence of interactions in the environment of a given site , the following expressions provide the exact leading contributions at weak disorder .    to leading order ,",
    "we can write @xmath95 this gives @xmath96 where @xmath97^{2}.\\label{4.9}\\ ] ] the green s function sum @xmath50 will numerically depend on the lattice geometry , but will generally be a dimensionless number of order one .",
    "the distribution of renormalized disorder @xmath98 is given by a convolution of the distributions @xmath99 and @xmath100@xmath101 if the bare distribution is bounded , ( e.g. a standard `` box '' distribution ) , then gaussian tails will emerge due to the fluctuations in @xmath102 , and the `` size '' of the tails will be determined by an effective disorder corresponding to @xmath103 . here , the superscript @xmath104 indicates that we ignored the interaction renormalizations . in the appendix",
    ", we argue that the effective scattering potentials @xmath76 will further renormalize the disorder distribution , but the gaussian tails will remain as its generic feature .",

    "the exponent @xmath56 , which determines the slope of the distribution tails , is shown at the lower panel as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it depends very weakly on the particular form of disorder distribution .      in the strict dmft formulation @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is simply the ( algebraic ) average dos of the conduction electrons , which therefore remains finite even at the localization transition.@xcite",
    "if @xmath109 is chosen to be large enough , the above seems to suggest that the griffiths phase may not emerge before the electrons localize at @xmath110 .",
    "however , in a theory that includes localization , the kondo spins do not see the average , but rather the _ typical _ dos of the conduction electrons.@xcite thus , in the nfl criterion , eq .",
    "( [ 3.10 ] ) , one should actually replace @xmath111 , a quantity that becomes very small ( and eventually vanishes ) as the anderson transition is approached , viz .",
    "@xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are constants .",
    "we thus get @xmath115 this transcendental equation can not be solved in closed form in general , but an approximate solution can be found for @xmath116 . in this case , the quantity @xmath117 will be small , and to leading order in @xmath118@xmath119 therefore , the griffiths phase emerges strictly _ before _ the transition is reached .",
    "previous work@xcite has shown that the electronic griffiths phase appears also in a single band hubbard model , as a precursor to the mott - anderson metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "since the hubbard model at half - filling is equivalent to the charge - transfer model@xcite of the mit , we examine in this section the appearance of the griffiths phase within this model , which can be considered a version of the anderson lattice model that we examined in our approach .",
    "the charge transfer model has been used to describe the mott metal - insulator transition for various systems , including copper oxides.@xcite it consists of a two band model , where one of the bands is narrow , and has large on - site interaction @xmath120 ( copper @xmath87-band ) , while the other band is broad enough that electron - electron interactions can be neglected ( oxygen @xmath121-band ) .",
    "a disordered version of this model is also appropriate to describe the mott - anderson transition@xcite in doped semiconductors such as si : p . here , the narrow band corresponds@xcite to the impurity band of the phosphorus donors , while the broad one is the conduction band of silicon .",

    "the main motivation for introducing this effective model lies in its simplicity , allowing an analytical solution , and thus providing further insight into the mechanism for the emergence of the electronic griffiths phase .",
    "nevertheless , an essential ingredient is still missing from our griffiths phase theory , namely the inter - site rkky interactions between kondo spins . according to the existing picture , all the spins with @xmath128 will not be kondo screened , thus providing a large contribution to thermodynamic response .",
    "these decoupled spins will , however , not act as free local moments , but will feature dynamics dominated by frustrating inter - site rkky interactions .",
    "recent experiments on disordered kondo alloys indeed seem to suggest the presence of low temperature glassy dynamics with a negligible freezing temperature.@xcite the simplifications introduced by our effective model open an attractive avenue to incorporate both the kondo effect and the rkky interaction in a single theory .",

    "in sec .  v we have ignored the fluctuations in the imaginary part of the cavity function @xmath129 the corresponding contribution to the low-@xmath1 tail is sub - leading , as we now show . we need to focus on rare events that produce exceptionally small values of the local conduction electron dos @xmath130 . using eq .",

    "thus , to leading order we can ignore these fluctuations when examining the emergence of the electronic griffiths phase .",
    "in these estimates , we have omitted an important ingredient , the fact that kondo disorder itself will produce additional scattering , i.e. disorder in the conduction channel , which needs to be self - consistently determined .",
    "as we have shown in previous work,@xcite this results in a distribution of effective scattering potentials @xmath76 , corresponding to the kondo spins ( note that in the uniform case , the @xmath76-s are the same on all sites , resulting in no scattering , but contributing to the formation of the kondo gap ) . the resulting scattering , in the weak disorder limit again can be considered as a gaussian distributed potential of width@xmath138 note however that this additional `` kondo '' scattering does not enter directly ( at site @xmath91 ) in the solution of the local kondo problem , since the local f - site `` sees '' the corresponding c - site _ with the f - site removed_. however , the presence of @xmath76-s on all other sites @xmath139 does modify the form of @xmath131 which , therefore , has to be computed by including this additional scattering . at weak disorder , we expect@xmath140 where the constant @xmath141 measures the response of the kondo spins to the hybridization disorder .",
    "note that @xmath142 enters here , since the @xmath76-s are obtained from the solution of local kondo problems , which are determined by the strength of the renormalized site disorder , as modified by hybridization fluctuations .",

    "of course , nonlinear effects at stronger disorder can not be accounted for in this simple fashion , which is especially true for the consideration of the additional scattering introduced by disordered kondo spins .",
