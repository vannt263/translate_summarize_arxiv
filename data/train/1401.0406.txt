    "in this article , we present an adaptation of de lellis and szkelyhidi s nonuniqueness construction @xcite to the system obtained by adding a passive tracer equation to the two - dimensional incompressible euler equations . more precisely , we are concerned with the system : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the velocity field , @xmath2 is the tracer , @xmath3 is the scalar pressure and @xmath4 .    in",
    "what follows , we will produce a velocity field @xmath5 and a scalar @xmath6 who are compactly supported in space - time , such that both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are non - zero in a set of positive measure in space - time , and such that @xmath7 is a weak solution of the two - dimensional incompressible euler equations while @xmath8 is a weak solution of the linear transport equation with velocity @xmath7 .    the initial motivation for the present work was to produce a wild solution for the three - dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations .",
    "we have not managed to accomplish this and we will point out , later in this work , the difficulty in achieving it . nevertheless , we observe that , under a special symmetry , the 3d mhd equations can be regarded as system .",
    "thus , our construction may be interpreted as the existence of wild solutions for the ( symmetry reduced ) 3d mhd equations ( see section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "the construction of wild solutions has been extended to other problems , namely for the incompressible porous media equations , see @xcite and for a class of active scalar equations , see @xcite .",
    "our work is yet another extension of de lellis and szkelyhidi s work ; in fact , as already mentioned , we will see that system can also be interpreted as a special case of the ideal incompressible mhd equations .",
    "let us now formulate more precisely the problem we address .",
    "we say that a vector field @xmath9 is a _ weak solution _ of ( [ p - t ] ) if , for any test function @xmath10 and any test vector field @xmath11 such that @xmath12 , it holds that @xmath13 above @xmath14 is the @xmath15 matrix given by @xmath16 , and @xmath17 stands for the frobenius product of two @xmath15 matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , given by @xmath20 .    our goal in this paper is to construct a special class of weak solutions of ( [ p - t ] ) by using convex integration .",
    "we are going to follow the approach presented in @xcite , where de lellis and szkelyhidi rewrite the euler equations as a differential inclusion and use convex integration to construct weak solutions of the euler equations with compact support in time and space .    the main result of this paper is stated bellow .    [ theo ] given a bounded domain @xmath21 , there exists a weak solution @xmath22 of the euler equations with a passive tracer ( [ p - t ] ) such that    * @xmath23 and @xmath24 for almost every @xmath25 ; * @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for almost every @xmath29 .",
    "the remainder of this article is divided as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we place system in the differential inclusion framework and we provide the main ingredients to perform the convex integration scheme . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we prove theorem [ theo ] and , finally , in section [ sec4 ] we apply the result to the ideal incompressible mhd system and we add some concluding remarks .",
    "following the usual approach , we rewrite as a system of linear pde s @xmath30 where @xmath31 we define the _ constraint set",
    "_ @xmath32 by @xmath33 $ ] with @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the one dimensional sphere and @xmath36 is the set of symmetric @xmath15 matrices with vanishing trace .",
    "it is clear that any solution @xmath37 of with image contained in @xmath32 is a solution of .",
    "we introduce the following @xmath38 matrix field @xmath39 and a new coordinate system @xmath40 . in this",
    "setting , equation ( [ linear ] ) reduces to @xmath41    let @xmath42 be the set of symmetric @xmath43 matrices @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 the set of @xmath47 matrices @xmath44 such that @xmath48 . observe that the following linear maps are isomorphisms @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51    as the equivalent representations above are the most natural ones , we will , from now on , not distinguish which one we will be considering , as it should be clear from the context .",
    "recall that a _ plane wave _ solution of is a solution @xmath52 , as in , of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and where @xmath55 .",
    "the _ wave cone _ is then the set of states of the planar solutions , that is , the set of states @xmath56 such that @xmath57 is a solution of for any @xmath58 . in our case ,",
    "the wave cone is given by @xmath59 or , equivalently , @xmath60    we introduce the relaxed set @xmath61),\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the convex hull of @xmath63 .",
    "one property which is important and not hard to verify is that @xmath64 .",
    "the proof goes along the same line as the one presented in @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath37 is a _ subsolution _ of if @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a distribution , if @xmath37 is a solution of and if the image of @xmath37 is contained in @xmath67 .",
    "the idea of the convex integration scheme is to construct a sequence of oscillating solutions which are obtained from adding localized versions of plane wave solutions to subsolutions of . in order to do so ,",
    "it is important to have the wave cone @xmath68 large enough so that it is possible to construct oscillating solutions collinear to a suitable fixed direction . in our case , it is easy to see that , for all @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , there exist @xmath72 and @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , which guarantees that the wave cone is large .",
    "the following result provides the  good  directions to oscillate in the sense that , by adding localized versions of plane waves in these directions to a subsolution , one still obtains a subsolution .",
    "[ li ] there exists a constant @xmath75 such that , for each @xmath76 , there exists @xmath77 satisfying    * @xmath78 ; * the line segment with endpoints",
    "@xmath79 belongs to @xmath80 ; * @xmath81 . by carathodory s theorem there exist @xmath82 , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , for @xmath85 , such that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the dimension of @xmath88 .",
    "suppose that @xmath89 and define @xmath90 the index such that @xmath91    observe that , since @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 thus , @xmath95 then , it follows by defining @xmath96 that @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , write @xmath99 and @xmath100 and set @xmath101    then @xmath102\\xi= \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{i^*}\\left[\\begin{array}{lll } ( v_{i^*}^1)^2-(v_{1}^1)^2 & v_{i^*}^1v_{i^*}^2-v_{1}^1v_{1}^2&v_{i^*}^1-v_{1}^1\\\\ v_{i^*}^2v_{i^*}^1-v_{1}^2v_{1}^1 & ( v_{i^*}^2)^2-(v_{1}^2)^2&v_{i^*}^2-v_{1}^2\\\\ v_{i^*}^1-v_{1}^1 & v_{i^*}^2-v_{1}^2 & 0\\\\ b_{i^*}v_{i^*}^1-b_1v_{1}^1 & b_{i^*}v_{i^*}^2-b_1v_{1}^2 & b_{i^*}-b_1               \\end{array } \\right]\\xi = 0.\\ ] ]    in the proof of lemma [ li ] we showed that , if @xmath103 , then @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the @xmath68-convex hull of @xmath63 coincides with the convex hull of @xmath63 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in contrast , for the 3d mhd system case we were not able to prove this type of result and , consequently , we could not perform the convex integration .",
    "it is clear that the only compactly supported plane wave is the trivial one .",
    "although we can not work with an exact wave solution , in the next result we construct a plane wave - like solution , which is a compactly supported solution of living in a small neighborhood of the line spanned by a fixed wave state .",

    "thus the image of @xmath153 is contained in the @xmath165-neighborhood of @xmath137 .",
