    "the topic of static charged fluid spheres in general relativity is a challenging issue and has given rise to interesting studies , even if their number is not so high .",
    "considering the research of the interior of stars in connection to their late stage evolution when the general relativistic effects play an important role , we notice the interesting work of tolman @xcite that yields a class of solutions for the static , spherically symmetric equilibrium fluid distribution .",
    "this important result was followed by some generalizations made by wyman @xcite , leibovitz @xcite and whitman @xcite .",
    "after them , bayin @xcite used the idea of the method of quadratures and gave new astrophysical solutions for the static fluid spheres .    in recent years , ray and das @xcite and ray et .",
    "@xcite have developed some interesting solutions for the static charged fluid spheres in general relativity following the above line of thinking .",
    "ray and das @xcite performed the charged generalization of bayin s work @xcite related to tolman s type astrophysically interesting aspects of stellar structure @xcite . in this light , they actually considered that even in the case of stellar astrophysics there are physical implications of the einstein - maxwell field equations .",
    "in other papers ray and das @xcite performed a study of some previous solutions considering the phenomenological connection of the gravitational field to the electromagnetic field , and demonstrated the purely electromagnetic origin of the charged relativistic stars given by tolman @xcite and bayin @xcite .",
    "the existence of this type of astrophysical solutions is thought to be a probable extension of lorentz s conjecture @xcite that electron - like extended charged particle possesses only ` electromagnetic mass ' and no ` material mass ' . in their latest work ray",
    "et al . @xcite have considered tolman - bayin type static charged fluid spheres in general relativity and they have found out many interesting results , specially the cases which give support to the charged spherical models in connection to normal stars . it is argued by them @xcite that due to the inclusion of charge and by a suitable choice of charge part , pressure and density function could be a decreasing function of radius from centre to surface in contrary to bayin s case @xcite .",
    "in this connection we also notice other two works , the first one elaborated by varela @xcite , which presents a neutral perfect fluid core bounded by a charged thin shell , and which demonstrates that it is possible to construct extended reissner - nordstrm sources with everywhere positive mass density , classical electron radius , electromagnetic mass , and everywhere non - negative gravitational mass .",
    "the other work was done by ivanov @xcite that studied the interior perfect fluid solutions for the reissner - nordstrm metric using a new classification scheme .",
    "in addition , he found general formulae in some particular cases , presented explicit new global solutions and made a revision of some known solutions . in connection to the singularity problem",
    "it is argued by ivanov @xcite that the presence of the charge function serves as a safety valve , which absorbs much of the fine - tuning necessary in the uncharged case .",
    "however , it is also believed by some authors @xcite that in the presence of charge the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric distribution of matter to a point singularity may be avoided through counterbalancing of the gravitational attraction by the repulsive coulombian force in addition to the thermal pressure gradient due to fluid .    in continuation of the above theme ,",
    "especially that of ray et al .",
    "@xcite , in the present article we have tried to solve the einstein - maxwell field equations in isotropic coordinate system and derived expressions for pressure and density .",
    "we have found out conditions for the boundary of the charged sphere .",
    "the exterior reissner - nordstrm solution is compared and constants of integrations are expressed in terms of mass and radius . the mass - radius and mass - charge relations have been found out for various cases of the charged matter distribution along with the pressure - to - density ratio at the centre of the charged sphere .    our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the einstein - maxwell field equations for the static charged fluid spheres in general relativity , we determine their analytical solutions making some assumption for the metric coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 and we consider two particular cases . in section 3 we find out boundary conditions , which consist in a vanishing value for the pressure and a specific value for the boundary @xmath2 of the star . the expression for the radius of the star @xmath2 is established in section 4 that is dedicated to a detailed analysis of the obtained solutions . the role of some parameters and integration constants in the evolution of pressure @xmath5 , density @xmath6 and radius of the star @xmath2 is discussed , with emphasis on some particular values . in conclusions we enlighten the physical significance of the results .",
    "the static spherically symmetric matter distribution corresponding to the isotropic line element is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath10 only .",
    "the einstein - maxwell field equations for the above line element can be written as @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where the total charge with a sphere of radius @xmath10 in terms of the @xmath14-currents @xmath15 is @xmath16 @xmath17 being the intensity of the electric field . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath18 are the pressure and matter - energy density , respectively .",
    "we have used prime to denote derivative with respect to radial coordinate @xmath10 only .",
    "the field equations without the charge @xmath19 have been studied by buchdahl @xcite and bayin @xcite who found physically meaningful solutions .",
    "equating equations ( [ mu1 ] ) and ( [ mu2 ] ) we get a differential equation by assuming @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    hence , to solve the above equation ( [ phi1 ] ) for @xmath25",
    "we make use of the _ ansatz _ @xmath26 so that the above equation becomes @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 behaves as the polynomial index .",
    "a direct solution for the above second order differential equation is difficult to find out .",
    "however , we can set different conditions for the parameters to get a solvable equation .",
    "let us therefore consider the following two cases",

    "the exterior field of a spherically symmetric static charged fluid distribution described by the metric ( 1 ) in isotropic coordinates is the unique reissner - nordstrm solution @xmath44 which by the radial coordinate transformation @xcite @xmath45 takes the form @xmath46 ^ 2 } dt^2- \\left[\\left(1+\\frac{m}{2r^{\\prime}}\\right)^2-\\frac{q^2}{4{r^{\\prime}}^2}\\right]^2 ( dr^2+r^2 d \\theta ^2+r^2sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2).\\ ] ]    therefore , matching at @xmath47 we get @xmath48 ^ 2 } , \\ ] ] @xmath49 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the boundary of the star . at the boundary pressure",

    "that means though that the weak energy condition ( wec ) is violated in our case but obeys the null energy condition ( nec ) as well as the strong energy condition ( sec ) and the dominant energy condition ( dec ) .",
    "this is a very specific charged fluid solution . in reference to the figure for p ( fig .",
    "1 ) , since @xmath62 gives the radius of the charged fluid ( rather we would say , @xmath63 ) , one may conclude that the radius of the charged fluid falls within @xmath64 to @xmath14 km .",
    "thus our charged fluid is highly compact and we may consider our charged fluid as typically a highly compact strange star ( we call it ` strange ' in the sense that eos components follow peculiar properties here i.e. they obey all energy conditions except wec ) . in this context",
    "we would like to mention that in the original bayin solutions , case v and case vi , @xmath65 is also negative .",
    "therefore , following bayin @xcite we are now in the position to find out pressure - to - density ratio at the centre of the charged sphere in the form",
    "@xmath66  we notice that the pressure - to - density ratio at the centre of the charged sphere is entirely independent of the @xmath56 and @xmath60 parameters and integration constant @xmath42 . in the case",
    "@xmath67 with @xmath68 we have @xmath69 and this is not the case with simultaneous positive pressure and density at the origin . for @xmath70 and @xmath68",
    "we obtain @xmath71 , which is a physically meaningful result for positive values for pressure and density at the origin . as a special case ,",
    "if we choose @xmath72 , then we can easily recover the equation of state related to the cases i and ii for @xmath73 of ray et al .",
    "@xcite which refers to the ` false vacuum ' or ` degenerate vacuum ' or ` @xmath65-vacuum ' equation of state @xcite . due to the repulsive nature of the pressure",
    "this provides a mechanism to avert the problem of singularity at the centre . on the other hand ,",

    "we expect to provide this study in a future project .",
    "the study of static charged fluid spheres in general relativity is far from being complete , but some recent studies have motivated us to extend one previous work  @xcite for improving the understanding of this topic .",
    "we found out the solutions of field equations in isotropic cases of charged fluid spheres in general relativity and performed a detailed study of the analytical solutions . in order to obtain the analytical solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations , we made use of some assumptions and introduced two specialization , the first with the specification @xmath107 and @xmath31 and the second with the values @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "we performed a deeper investigation of the solutions and for the case @xmath107 and @xmath31 we established the expression for the pressure - to - density ratio at the origin given by @xmath114 and the imposed conditions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for obtaining a physically meaningful model for the star .",
    "for a zero value of @xmath58 we obtained the case of the _ false vacuum _ or _ degenerate vacuum _ or _",
    "@xmath65-vacuum _ @xcite .",
    "in addition , we found out the explicit expression for the radius @xmath2 and discussed the physically reasonable cases .",
    "the radius @xmath2 for the charged sphere has a completed expression which , however , reduces to the same expression as in the non - charge case of bayin  @xcite . finally , comparing reissner - nordstrm metric in isotropic coordinates we established the expressions for the integration constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath57 parameter in terms of mass @xmath43 and the radius of the star @xmath2 . on the other hand for the specification @xmath108 and @xmath36 we computed the pressure @xmath5 and the density @xmath65 that present a dependence on a new function @xmath115 and its first and second derivatives with respect to the @xmath10 coordinate . in this case the expression for the pressure - to - density ratio at the origin can directly be given by @xmath116 .",
    "we also gave the expressions that allow to evaluate the boundary @xmath2 of the star and the values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath57 in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath2 , but due to their complicated form we plan to perform a detailed study in a future work .",
    "the most straight forward observation in the present work is that from our results we are able to recover the neutral cases of bayin @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the models presented here have negative energy density and positive pressure and support the conclusion that static charged fluid spheres are connected to compact strange stars .",
    "we conclude that in the last years there is progress in the study of static charged fluid spheres which are connected to compact stars , but deeper and wider investigations for searching for new solutions need to be performed .",
    "one possibility will be to investigate our scenario based on different specialization and obtain new analytical solutions that can lead to other particular cases and more constrained connections with the involved parameters .",
