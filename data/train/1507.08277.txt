    "attempts to describe models of areas of physics in terms of cellular automata ( cas ) reach back to e. fredkin , 1990 @xcite , and s. wolfram s work in 2002 @xcite .",
    "some of these works applied cellular automata to areas of quantum theory ( qt ) ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the relation of cas to the lagrangian or a related construct , such as the hamiltonian or an action , has been addressed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    two items that make cas especially attractive for the modeling of specific areas of physics",
    "are the following :    1 .",
    "cas imply discreteness of the variables that constitute the system state .",
    "+ generally and traditionally , physics theories do not assume discrete state variables .",
    "the discrete eigenstates of quantum theory represent only a special case of discreteness .",
    "discreteness with other special aspects is addressed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "2 .   cas represent a functional model of the subject theory , i.e. , a model that specifies the dynamical evolution of the system in terms of state transitions .    while these properties are desirable for special types of formulations of physics theories ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , they represent a challenge at the same time because existing standard formulations of areas of physics , in general , are well - suited neither for discreteness nor for functional descriptions .",
    "after trying to formulate a lagrangian - based and ca - based model of different areas of physics , it turned out that the classical ca is not a sufficient basis for the modeling of more advanced areas of physics ( such as quantum field theory ) and that the lagrangian provides much but not the complete content of the physics theories .",
    "thus , the objective of this paper is also the identification of missing pieces and deficiencies and the provision of proposals to overcome these deficiencies .",
    "section 2 contains a proposal for a ca called qftca , which is an extension of the classical ca . in section 3 , for some major areas of classical physics ( e.g. , newtonian mechanics , waves , fields , non - relativistic quantum mechanics )",
    ", the lagrangian is transformed into a ca - based functional model .",
    "quantum field theory ( qft ) , the main subject of this paper , is addressed in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "section 6 describes a ca - based functional model for interactions in qft .",
    "the cas are , as much as possible , derived from the lagrangian for the subject areas of physics .",
    "more precisely , the cas are derived from the equations of motion that are derived from the lagrangian .",
    "the transformation of the equation of motion into a ca , which shows the dynamical state evolution in accordance with the equation of motion , is relatively straightforward .",
    "however , the generation of a ca that provides a more complete functional model of the subject area of physics requires additional specifications that can not be deduced solely from the equation of motion .",
    "therefore , the ca - based functional model of qft interactions ( section 6 ) is based on the functional model of qft interactions described in @xcite .",
    "the ca described in this paper has been accompanied by a computer model qftca , which enables experimentation with alternative solutions and the generation of the illustrations of examples contained in this paper .",
    "however , the computer model is not the subject of the present paper . a rough overview of the computer model is given in appendix a.",
    "the classical ca consists of a k - dimensional grid of cells .",
    "the state of the ca is given by the totality of the states of the individual cells .",
    "state @xmath0 + with traditional standard cas , the cell states uniformly consist of the same state components    @xmath1 + typically , the number of state components , j , is 1 , and the possible values are restricted to integer numbers .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the ca is given by the `` update - function '' , which computes the new state of a cell as a function of its current state and the states of the neighbor cells .",
    "the full functionality and complexity of a particular cellular automaton is concentrated in the update - function . as wolfram ( see @xcite ) and others ( see , for example , @xcite ) showed , a large variety of process types ( e.g. , stable , chaotic , pseudo - random , oscillating ) can be achieved with relatively simple update - functions .      to enable support of the most advanced areas of physics ( e.g. , qt / qft ) , including support of multiple fields and particles ,",
    "a cellular automaton qftca is defined , which is an extension of the classical ca , made by embedding the ca into an overall physics - based system structure .",
    "the embedding into the physics - based system structure affects two aspects : the structure of the state of the system and the functions for the dynamic evolution of the system .",
    "the states of qftca can not be expressed solely by the collection of cell states .",
    "in addition to the `` local '' information contained in the ca cells , non - local information about physical objects ( e.g. , waves , particles and fields ) have to be part of the system state .",
    "position related ( i.e. , local ) information of physical objects can be assigned to cell states .",
    "other ( non - local ) information has to be kept in addition to the cell states . the ca cells \\{@xmath2 } represent the space . the particles and the fields have to be mapped to the space , i.e. , to the ca cells .",
    "the state components of an individual cell depend on the particle or field to which the cell belongs .",
    "the set of state components is thus not uniform for all cells .",
    "the possible values of the state components are not restricted to integer values ( however , a discrete value set may be assumed with specific types of state components ) . for the mapping of the overall system state to the ca cells , the following hold true :    * for the qftca described in this paper , it is left open which state components are assigned to ca cells as opposed to state components that are kept with the physical objects . it has to be ensured that the cells ( i.e. , space points ) belonging to a physical object can be determined and vice versa ; i.e. , that the physical objects occupying a ca cell can be determined . *",
    "a physical object may cover multiple cells .",
    "* a cell may be covered by multiple physical objects .",
    "* time is _ not _ a ( fourth ) dimension of qftca .",
    "instead , the time derivatives such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are explicit parts of the system state .",
    "the above - described state structure and timing considerations result in differing contents of ca cells and ca update - functions , which depend on the physical objects assigned to the cells .",
    "the structuring of the overall system state into the ca cells and the superimposed physical objects was also motivated by the differing update requirements of the physical objects .",
    "the update - functions field - update - function ( ) , pw - update - function ( ) and perform - interaction ( ) are derived from the lagrangian and/or from the equation of motion of the pertaining field or particle type . moreover",
    ", the ca has to be initialized , partly by information derived from the lagrangian and partly by additional application - specific specifications .    for the evolution of the overall system state",
    ", qftca assumes that the execution proceeds in uniform global time steps .",
    "the update - function for the individual particle / waves , however , has to proceed in proper time associated with the particle / waves .",
    "the objective of a cellular automaton of an area of physics is to show the dynamical evolution of a physical system within the subject area . within physics the dynamical evolution of a system",
    "is described by the _ equation(s ) of motion_. given a lagrangian l , the equation of motion can be derived from the lagrangian by using the euler - lagrange equation    \\(1 ) @xmath5 .",
    "+ example 1 : the lagrangian for classical mechanics : l = v - t with @xmath6 ( see , for example @xcite , page 24 ) the euler - lagrange equation leads to    \\(a ) @xmath7    \\(b ) @xmath8 .",
    "+ equating ( a ) to ( b ) gives    @xmath9 + assuming v(x ) caused by a force f , such that @xmath10 gives    \\(2 ) @xmath11 + with this example , the objective of the ca would be to show the dynamical evolution of x , the position of the moving particle .",
    "thus , the ca update - function has to provide the dynamical update of the system state , in particular the update of x. equation ( 2 ) enables the computation of @xmath12 , provided the other variables appearing within ( 2 ) are known . from @xmath12 ,",
    "the updated value of x can be computed provided the actual values of @xmath13 and x are known .",
    "the above described process for the derivation of the ca update - function from the lagrangian or the equation of motion is not considered to be part of the ca execution .",
    "it is rather part of the process that generates the ca update - function from a given lagrangian ( or equation of motion ) .",
    "the computer model qftca ( see @xcite ) supports in addition to the executing ca the ca generation .      the ca update - function",
    "is invoked repetitively from the ca to update the system state in constant time intervals .",
    "two cases of system state update can be distinguished :    1 .",
    "update of the particle state , primarily the particle position , 2 .",
    "update of fields , primarily the field state variable @xmath14 assigned to the ca cells .    for both cases ,",
    "the equation of motion has to be interpreted .",
    "the particle positions can be updated if the equation of motion delivers @xmath12 ( or @xmath15 or x ) ( see sections 3.1 and 3.2 for more details ) .",
    "the field state can be updated if the equation of motion delivers @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) ( see sections 3.3 and 3.5 for more details ) .",
    "the lagrangian for a specific area of physics is typically a very compact and very abstract equation . to obtain a runnable automaton that shows the dynamical evolution of a system , an initial state with initial values for all state components",
    "is required .",
    "as will be shown in the following sections , there exist special constraints for the `` valid '' initial states for the various physics areas and their lagrangians .",
    "these constraints can not be derived from the lagrangian but are usually hidden in additional laws of physics .",
    "the basic lagrangian mechanism , as originally introduced by lagrange , defines    @xmath18 + where t = kinetic energy , v = potential energy .",
    "as described in section 2.3 , the euler - lagrange equation allows the generation of the equation of motion    @xmath9 .",
    "+ to execute the ca , initial settings are required for all entities ( and certain derivatives of these entities ) appearing in the equation of motion . setting the initial ( and constant ) value for @xmath19 , i.e. , assuming a constant power f , leads to the execution of    @xmath11 + for the specified initial values .",
    "an example is illustrated in fig .",
    "+ instead of specifying @xmath19 it is also possible to initialize the potential v(x ) explicitly by a specific spatial distribution and initial values for all ca cells @xmath20 .",
    "this enables more general multi - dimensional modeling .",
    "a particle of mass m undergoing simple harmonic motion is described by the lagrangian    @xmath21 ( see , for example , @xcite , page 25 ) . + the euler - lagrange equation leads to    \\(a ) @xmath22    \\(b ) @xmath23 + equating ( a ) to ( b ) gives the equation of motion    @xmath24 .",
    "+    with @xcite the equation of motion for the harmonic oscillator is    @xmath25 @xmath26    @xmath27 ( in case x0 = 0 ) .",
    "2 shows a snapshot of running qftca with the lagrangian for the harmonic oscillator @xmath28 .",
    "the standard formulation of the `` wave equation '' , i.e. , the equation of motion for waves , is ( see , for example @xcite )    \\(3 ) @xmath29 .",
    "+ the three - dimensional version is    \\(4 ) @xmath30 .",
    "+ depending on the particular context , the equation may be varied or extended by setting the right hand side not equal to 0 .",
    "for example , in @xcite the equation of motion for class 1 waves is    \\(5 ) @xmath31 .",
    "+ to obtain the ca update - function , the equation of motion has to be transformed into a sequence of computation steps , including the replacement of the differential operations by discrete `` @xmath32-units '' .",

    "the above sequence of ca computation steps can be generalized and is applicable to arbitrary lagrangians , except for the lagrangian - specific step 4 .",
    "the computation requires an equation of motion that delivers @xmath45 and an initial system state that contains initial values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( or , alternatively , @xmath48 ) for the relevant positions x. the ca execution has to start with an initial state that represents a specific physical situation .",
    "notice that the lagrangian and thus the system state of the ca does not include variables that are usually included in physics theories of waves such as frequency , amplitude , wavelength and energy .",
    "these variables are implied by the initial state of the wave and explicitly supported by the ca only if they appear in the equation of motion .",
    "such hidden variables may also appear in the constraints for the initial state mentioned in 2.3 .",
    "fig.3 shows a snapshot from the dynamical evolution of a wave according to the equation of motion @xmath29 and a suitable initial state .",
    "fields are based on waves . as with waves ( section 3.3 ) , instead of the position variables @xmath49 , @xmath15 and @xmath50 of the particles ,",

    "the functional model assumes that interaction objects , similar to virtual particles , have a limited life - time before they decay into the `` out '' particles / waves that are the result of the interaction .",

    "one of the rules is split ( @xmath116 ; combine(@xmath117 .",
    "+ sometimes qft rules allow for multiple results for split ( ) and combine ( ) . for example , split(photon ) may result in ( electron , positron ) , ( muon , antimuon ) , or ( tauon , antitauon ) .",
    "finally , with specific `` in '' particle / wave combinations , it may turn out that some of the possible interaction - channels may be considered equivalent , and therefore only one of them has to be included .",

    "the operator split(a ) @xmath118 ( b , c ) is a non - bijective function insofar , as there are many alternatives with respect to the attributes ( e.g. , momentum and spin ) of the resulting ( b , c ) . rather than selecting a particular specific result , qft ( and the functional model of qt interactions )",
    "requires that a multitude of possible results are generated with differing probability amplitudes assigned .",
    "thus , split(a ) @xmath114 ( b , c ) results in a two - fold splitting and may be expressed as    split(a ) @xmath119 .",
    "+ for the interaction object this means that a multitude of paths representing @xmath120 have to be generated . as a consequence ,",
    "at the end each interaction - channel contains a multitude of paths because each interaction - channel includes a split ( ) operator .",
    "the alternative interaction - channels that are generated by the varying application of the split ( ) and combine ( ) operators are processed in parallel .",
    "the effects of processing the split ( ) and combine ( ) operators is reflected in extensions of and changes in the interaction object .",

    "these rules are well known and described in many textbooks on qft ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , with qft the respective rules are defined in terms of ( external and internal ) lines and vertices of feynman diagrams . for the functional model , the qft rules",
    "have been mapped to rules regarding the split ( ) and combine ( ) operators .",
    "the processing of the interaction channels ends with a certain `` out '' particle / wave combination . with some types of interactions , different `` out '' particle / wave combinations may occur .",
    "the functional model of qt interactions assumes that from the possibly multiple alternative `` out '' particle / wave combinations only one will actually leave an interaction .    after processing the individual interaction channels ( in parallel ) , each interaction channel contains the same set of paths , however , with different probability amplitudes for the paths .",
    "therefore , the multiple interaction channels can be ( re-)united by the summation of the corresponding amplitudes . according to qft rules ( usually formulated in terms of feynman diagrams ) ,",
    "the `` summation '' , in some cases , has to be performed with a negative sign ( i.e. , @xmath121 instead of @xmath122 ) .      in the above sections a relatively rough description of the ca - based functional model of qft interactions",
    "disregarding the size limitations for the present paper , additional , more detailed specifications would be desirable for the mapping of ( 1 ) the interaction process steps to ca - update functions and ( 2 ) the related system state to ca cells .",
    "as the simplest and initial solution it can be assumed that the whole interaction ( with the above described four process steps ) is performed during a single invocation of the update function and that , except for the elimination of non - interacting paths ; this process affects only a single cell until the interaction results are generated . as a next level of refinement",
    ", it is imaginable that parts of the interaction process , such as the split ( ) and combine ( ) operators , can be mapped to the ca - based model of waves and fields , as described in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "this author s computer model ( see @xcite has the objective to support the development of further model refinements .      with the above described functional model of qft interactions , the function `` qft - interaction ( ) '' does not constitute a bijective mapping .",
    "step 0 , `` occurrence of interaction '' , does not provide a surjective mapping ; only one of the multiple `` in '' particle positions is mapped to the interaction result .",
    "step 3 , `` generation of ' ' out `` particles / waves '' , does not represent an injective mapping ; multiple `` out '' paths with non - zero probability amplitudes are generated such that the ingoing state could only partly be reconstructed from the `` out '' state .",
    "altogether , the interaction process implies a non - bijective mapping .",
    "as described in section 6.5 , this non - bijective mapping associated with qft interactions offers an explanation for part of the limitations and peculiarities of qt measurement .",
    "the lagrangian ( and related constructs such as the hamiltonian and the equation of motion ) is an impressively powerful basis for the formulation of theories of areas of physics .",
    "many details of existing physics theories can be derived from the lagrangian .",
    "many past findings in physics theories have been developed by considerations of the lagrangian ( mostly symmetry considerations ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lagrangians do not completely specify physics theories . as shown in this paper ,",
    "mainly two additional aspects are required to enable the construction of a comprehensive ca - based functional model that reflects subject physics theory .    1",
    ".   initial states for the execution of the equation of motion + the lagrangian and equations of motion are typically differential equations . as a trivial matter of mathematics , to obtain solutions for the differential equations or a model that shows the dynamical evolution of a system , some initial state ( i.e. , initial values for the differential equation ) has to be assumed . as shown with the sample areas of physics ( sections 3 , 4 and 5 ) , however , it is not sufficient to select arbitrary initial states . typically , various types of constraints exist for the initial state",
    ". only part of these constraints can be derived from the lagrangian .",
    "further constraints have to be derived from the full physics theory as described in related textbooks .",
    "process models of physics theories + as described in section 1 , a cellular automaton may be viewed as a specific type of a `` functional model '' ( or `` process model '' ) , i.e. , a model that specifies the dynamical evolution of the system in terms of state transitions . with classical areas of physics , such as newtonian mechanics ( see section 3.1 ) ,",
    "such a process model in the form of a ca can be derived from the lagrangian . with more advanced physics theories ,",
    "additional statements are required for the specification of the dynamical evolution of a system .",
    "partly , these additional statements can be found in textbooks of the respective physics theories .",
    "partly , the required additional statements are still missing or still debated among physicists .",
    "the major subject in which the provision of a process model ( here , in the form of a ca ) requires additional specifications is the area of interactions in quantum field theory ( section 5 ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the classical ca depends exclusively on information that can be assigned to the ca cells , and the update - function for a cell depends only on the contents of the neighbor cells ( including the respective cell ) .",
    "this cell - related information is here called `` local information '' . differing from classical cas , the system state of qftca described in this paper contains , in addition to the cell - related ( local ) information , non - local information pertaining to the physical objects ( e.g. , fields and particles ) . while originally the inclusion of the non - local information was merely justified by the goal to obtain a decent model , it turned out that the inclusion of non - local information to represent physical objects spanning larger areas of cell - space is key for the modeling of non - local effects in connection with qft interactions ( see section 5 ) .",
    "non - local effects , such as the collapse of the wave function and entanglement , can best be explained by the assumption of physical objects with non - local attributes and actions ( see below , section 6.5 measurement ) .",
    "deviating from the trend in physics theories to treat space dimensions and the time dimension , as much as possible , on equal footing , the lagrangian - based ca described in this paper assumes a special role of time with several aspects :    1 .",
    "time is _ not _ a fourth dimension of the ca , + instead , qftca maintains only a single time slice ( i.e. , the current time slice ) .",
    "as described in section 2 , this implies that the time derivatives appearing in the equation of motion ( e.g. , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) have to be kept explicitly as part of the system state .",
    "while this may be viewed as just a type of implementation decision for the qftca , it also supports the author s goal to show that models for the evolution of our universe that assume only a single time layer are at least feasible .",
    "the existence of a time arrow + the goal of providing a functional model , such as a ca - based model , of a physics theory may be viewed as presupposing causality and an arrow of time .",
    "insofar , it should not be a surprise that the qftca described in this paper implies an arrow of time .",
    "the neutrality with respect to a direction of time that is represented in the ( declarative ) equations of physics theories , such as the lagrangians , is necessarily lost with the construction of a functional ( e.g. , ca - based ) model .",
    "one of the key properties of ca - based models is discreteness with respect to space and time .",
    "discreteness with respect to space and time coordinates may cause discreteness with respect to further aspects , such as , for example , momentum .",
    "two questions arise : ( 1 ) whether discreteness impedes the precise modeling of physics theories and ( 2 ) to which extent discreteness enables new solutions in areas that are not yet completely understood .      to achieve compatibility with the predictions of the standard formulations of physics theories , the granularity of the space and time coordinates has to be sufficiently fine . it can be expected that the finer the granularity is , the better the agreement of the results of the ca - based modeling is with the results predicted by the theories and the results measured in experiments . it can also be expected ( and has been confirmed by the author s computer simulations ) that an insufficiently fine granularity may , in some cases , result in chaotic ( i.e. , unpredictable ) behavior of the ca .",
    "a conclusive answer to the above question requires more complete computer modeling from the author .",
    "discreteness may result in non - linear and even unpredictable behavior ( especially if there is insufficiently fine granularity ) .",
    "this leads to the question of whether the discreteness of the ca may provide an explanation for the non - determinism of qt .",
    "the author s work in this area ( including the computer model qftca , see @xcite ) has so far not resulted in a final answer to this question .",
    "while it is easy to generate unpredictability , it has been ( so far ) not possible to generate through discreteness unpredictability that adheres to the laws of qt .    as a further application of discreteness , the functional model of qft ( see @xcite ) , which is also the basis for the ca - based model described in section 5 , assumes discreteness with the paths of a particle .",
    "this enables a functional model of qft interactions that offers a new solution for the non - linearity associated with the collapse of the wave function ( see section 5 ) and qt measurement ( see @xcite and section 6.5 below ) .      in @xcite , a functional model of qt measurement",
    "is described with the following key characteristics :    1",
    ".   a measurement always implies interactions between the measured quantum object and the measurement environment .",
    "+ measurements of qt observables can be performed using a variety of measurement devices , apparatuses , and processes .",
    "all such measurement processes have to include at least one interaction in which the measured object exchanges information with some other entity belonging to the measurement apparatus .",
    "2 .   the model of measurement interactions",
    "is based on qft interactions , as described in section 5 .",
    "+ the model assumes that the interactions between the measured qt object and the measurement apparatus are `` normal '' interactions that adhere to the laws of quantum field theory .",
    "3 .   in general ,",
    "the interacting particles / waves consist of multiple `` paths '' with different associated probability amplitudes .",
    "the interaction always occurs at a definite position .",
    "only the paths that cover the interaction position determine the result of the ( measurement ) interaction .",
    "the measurement process includes a collapse of the wave function .",
    "+ after the interacting paths are determined and used to generate the interaction result ( i.e. , measurement result ) , all of the remaining paths are discarded .",
    "this may be considered as the `` collapse of the wave function '' .",
    "as described in section 5 , qft interactions support only a non - bijective mapping of the `` in '' state to the `` out '' state and thus only the limited exchange of information .",
    "this limited exchange of information is the cause of some of the limitations and peculiarities of qt measurements .",
    "the qftca described in the present paper ( section 5 ) supports the functional model of qt measurement described in @xcite and adds further details to item ( 3 ) ( definite interaction position ) and item ( 4 ) ( collapse of the wave function ) .",
    "linearity is a very important feature of qt .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to discuss the linearity / non - linearity of cas in general and of qftca specifically . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , h - t .",
    "elze discusses the general linearity / non - linearity of cas in detail . as a supplement to the findings described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the findings of the author using the computer model of qftca ( see @xcite ) show that an insufficiently fine granularity of the discreteness of a ca may cause a theoretically linear process to become non - linear or even chaotic .",
    "for qftca specifically , the preservation of linearity is not considered an issue .",
    "qftca is seen as a type of `` implementation '' of an underlying theory ( primarily qft ) . where the underlying theory requires linearity",
    ", qftca must provide linearity .",
    "there are , however , two areas where qft , the theory underlying qftca , does not define sufficient detail for a ca implementation ; therefore , the solution(s ) chosen by qftca may potentially violate linearity .",
    "the two aforementioned areas are the following :    1 .   the collapse of the wave function + the request for",
    "the linearity of qt applies to the normal progression of the quantum system as described by the laws of qt .",
    "however , the laws of qt ( in particular the equations of motion , e.g. , the schrdinger equation ) describe only the evolution of probabilities and probability amplitudes . for the transition of the probabilities to facts ( i.e. , the measurement ) ,",
    "there does not yet exist a generally agreed - upon theory .",
    "ideas and proposals for a theory on measurement often assume the collapse of the wave function .",
    "theories of the collapse of the wave function have a tendency towards non - linear solutions ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "qftca is based on the functional model of qt interactions described in @xcite , which also assumes a collapse of the wave function .",
    "differing from the theories described in @xcite and @xcite , which achieve non - linearity by modifications of the differential equations of the equation of motion , the functional model of qt interactions , as represented by qftca , utilizes the power and flexibility of functional descriptions to achieve the desired discontinuity associated with the collapse of the wave function .",
    "qft interactions + as described in section 6.5 .",
    ", qftca assumes that normal qft interactions may represent a measurement and that , therefore , normal qft interactions may contain a collapse of the wave function .",
    "thus , to which extent qft interactions may represent non - linearities ( in case they include a collapse of the wave function ) must be discussed .",
    "+ in qft , an important construct for the treatment of qft interactions is the scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) . in @xcite ,",
    "weinberg states that the s - matrix has been proven to be a unitary matrix .",
    "this characteristic of the s - matrix is often seen as a proof that qft interactions obey linearity .",
    "however , the scattering matrix is not the equation of motion of qft interactions .",
    "as described in sections 5 , the qft interaction does not perform a bijective mapping of the `` in '' state to the `` out '' state . whether or not this",
    "may still be considered to be a linear progression of the equation of motion is not clear to the author .    to summarize , it is not clear whether the above - mentioned potential non - linearities indeed represent non - linearities , and if they do , whether these non - linearities are already present within the underlying qft is also unclear .",
    "elze showed in @xcite that modifications in the underlying equation of motions may result in non - linearities .",
    "qftca does not assume a modification of the underlying equations of motion ( or lagrangian or hamiltonian ) but adds some interpretation details to enable the generation of a functional model .",
    "the functional model of qt measurement described in @xcite includes a model on entanglement .",
    "the basic assumption is that the paths that represent alternative measurement outcomes , even with normal qft interactions ( see section 5.3 ) , encompass both correlated particles / waves .",
    "when a measurement ( i.e. , a qft interaction ) selects a single path for the interacting particle / wave , the selection also determines a specific correlation .",
    "this mechanism is not further addressed in the present paper .",
    "this paper describes an exercise to construct models of areas of physics in terms of a cellular automaton and to derive these models ( i.e. , the concrete ca ) , as much as possible , from the lagrangian of the respective physics theory . because it was not expected that the classical ca is sufficient to model all areas of physics , nor that the lagrangian alone is sufficient to derive complete functional models of the physics theories , a further aim of the exercise was to determine where the respective limitations are and how they can be overcome with extensions ( of the ca ) and the additional information required for a complete functional model .",
    "the required extensions to the classical ca resulted in the proposal for a qftca described in section 2.2 .",
    "the most significant extension is the inclusion of non - local physics objects , i.e. , objects that span larger areas of cell - space and may overlap .",
    "the lagrangian and equation of motion provide a powerful basis for the provision of a ( ca - based ) functional model . for the modeling of advanced areas of physics , such as qt / qft ,",
    "however , additional specifications are required .",
    "partly , the additional specifications can be obtained from the subject physics theories as described in textbooks . with qft , even further specifications , which can not be derived from the standard formulation of qft ,",
    "are required .",
    "the functional model of qft interactions described in @xcite has been taken as the basis for the ca - based model described in this paper ( section 5 and 6 ) .",
    "in addition to the determination and circumvention of the mentioned limitations , the construction of the lagrangian - driven ca - based functional model led to a number of issues ( see section 6 : consequences of discreteness , the role of non - local information , the special role of time , weakening the goal of linearity ) that are probably of interest beyond the scope of the present paper . with some of these issues , only preliminary results can be offered by the author .",
    "more conclusive answers can probably only be developed through further computer simulations .",
    "discussions with prof .",
