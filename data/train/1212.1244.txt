    "in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , newton s equations of motion are solved numerically to produce trajectories of the system in the microcanonical @xmath0 ensemble .",
    "the most commonly used scheme for this purpose is the verlet method , which is based on truncated taylor expansions for the evolution of a particle with mass @xmath1 , coordinate @xmath2 , velocity @xmath3 , and force @xmath4 @xcite . introducing the discrete - time variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , the so - called velocity explicit verlet ( or velocity verlet ) scheme reads @xmath8 by considering two successive time steps and eliminating the velocity variables from the equations , the more original form of the strmer - verlet method @xcite ( here called the position - verlet method ) , is found @xmath9 with the associated velocity calculated by the central difference @xmath10 the verlet scheme is accurate to second order in @xmath11 , which means that the deviation , per time step , of the computed trajectory from the true ( analytic ) one , scales with the third power of @xmath11 .",
    "the merits of the verlet scheme that make it so widely popular for md simulations include its convenience , efficiency , and time reversibility , which ensures that the error of the total energy of long - time integrations is bounded and does not drift or diffuse , as illustrated by the exact solution to the verlet method applied to a harmonic oscillator ( see , e.g. , below ) .",
    "the most frequently used ensemble in statistical - mechanics is the canonical @xmath12 ensemble where the temperature of the system , rather than its energy , is constant .",
    "a variety of methods for conducting md simulations in the canonical ensemble have been proposed over the years .",
    "a very appealing class of such methods include integrators for langevin dynamics ( ld ) simulations . in ld",
    ", two forces are added to the conservative force field - a friction force proportional to the velocity with friction coefficient @xmath13 , and thermal white noise @xmath14 .",
    "explicitly , the langevin equation of motion is given by @xcite @xmath15 in order to satisfy the dissipation - fluctuation theorem , it is often assumed that the stochastic force is gaussian distributed , and has the statistical properties @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath18 is the thermodynamic temperature of the heat bath .",
    "the difficulty to develop accurate integrators for ld stems from the non - analytic nature of @xmath14 , which invalidates the taylor expansion commonly used for the derivation of the verlet scheme .",
    "the most naive way to overcome this difficulty is to replace the delta - function correlated noise with a set of rectangular pulses of mean - squared size @xmath19 , each of which acting over the centered time interval @xmath20 . employing this approximation for @xmath14 yields the famous brooks - brnger - karplus ( bbk ) scheme @xcite , which unfortunately turns out to exhibit a simulated temperature that differs by @xmath21 from the correct one @xcite .",
    "this disappointing result can be attributed to the effect of a small time step @xmath11 , which results in a stochastic velocity change of order @xmath22 that overshadows the `` regular '' ( deterministic ) linear velocity change of order @xmath11 .",
    "statistical analysis of the small time interval shows , in fact , that the opposite is true , since the average over all noise realizations vanishes . in order to develop a reliable integrator for ld one therefore needs to carefully treat the coupling between the stochastic and analytic contributions .",
    "this is , unfortunately , not easily accomplished with a discretized approximation for @xmath14 .",
    "a different approach to the problem has been introduced by ermak and buckholz ( eb ) @xcite .",

    "first , the friction force is accounted for separately from the other two forces , via exponentially decaying functions .",
    "second , this scheme considers an ensemble of trajectories instead of a single one , thereby requiring two random gaussian numbers per time step .",
    "the one appearing in the velocity equation , @xmath24\\beta(t^\\prime)dt^\\prime$ ] , represents the stochastic change in velocity during the time interval .",
    "the other , @xmath25\\}\\beta(t^\\prime)dt^\\prime$ ] , appears in the position equation and characterizes the random displacement .",
    "these two numbers are different , but _ correlated_.",
    "third , there is formally no need to compute the new position before the new velocity as in the velocity - verlet scheme and , in principle , one can interchange the order by which the equations are evolved .",
    "the last point is particularly important since it is directly related to the most critical issue that remains unsolved with the eb approach , which is how to perform the numerical integration over the deterministic force @xmath26 .",
    "the appearance of exponential `` weight functions '' in the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ analytic_v ] ) and ( [ analytic_r ] ) opens the possibility for using a variety of linear combinations involving @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the most popular integration schemes for the deterministic force constitute the van gunsteren - berendsen @xcite and the langevin impulse @xcite methods .",
    "more recently , ricci and ciccotti ( rc ) introduced a formalism for a systematic derivation of numerical integrators for ld @xcite .",
    "the essential steps of the formalism are to ( i ) express the integrator as an exponential operator , ( ii ) split the time interval @xmath11 into a series of even smaller time steps , and ( iii ) use the suzuki - trotter expansion for time - ordered exponential operators to find an approximation for the evolution operator corresponding to @xmath11 . by using mid - point splitting",
    ", rc arrived at a scheme that require only one random number per @xmath11 .",
    "the same formalism was later used to develop a new family of integrators that more carefully treat the coupling between the stochastic and deterministic components of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of these new schemes is that they require two _ independent _ random numbers per time step , which is different from the eb family of schemes , where two correlated random numbers are involved .",
    "returning for a moment to md simulations of newtonian dynamics , it is important to recall that , due to its computational efficiency and time reversibility , the verlet method is regarded as superior to other integration methods that may produce more accurate trajectories . in the case of ld ,",
    "the trajectories include a random component and , therefore , their accuracy ( which can only be defined in statistical terms ) becomes an issue of even less importance .",
    "the efficiency of different methods for canonical ensemble simulations of many - particles systems must be tested according to their ability to reproduce measurable statistical quantities , such as the boltzmann distribution corresponding to the temperature of the heat bath . to this end",
    ", none of the existing methods has managed to demonstrate exact thermodynamic response @xcite .",
    "we here present a novel verlet - type scheme for ld simulations that is very simple to implement and which yields _ correct _ statistical - mechanical behavior of a particle diffusing in both a flat and a harmonic potential .",
    "in the spirit of the simplicity of the verlet algorithm in its traditional forms , we here arrive at a new useful method through a straight - forward derivation . starting with the continuous - time langevin equations ( [ eq_l2])-([eq_l4 ] )",

    "this deficiency , which is common to all verlet - type methods , arises from the known discrepancy between displacement and momentum as conjugated variables .",
    "this means that using the variance of the velocity for precisely assessing the temperature of a simulated system may be counterproductive .",
    "the appropriate criterion for obtaining the desired temperature is the achievement of correct statistical sampling , which is indeed given by our method .",
