    "the inclusion of dissipative terms in the energy - momentum tensor of the cosmological fluid seems to be the best motivated generalization of the matter term of the gravitational field equations .",
    "the first attempts at creating a theory of relativistic dissipative fluids were those of eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "these theories are now known to be pathological in several respects .",
    "regardless of the choice of equation of state , all equilibrium states in these theories are unstable and in addition signals may be propagated through the fluid at velocities exceeding the speed of light .",

    "dissipative viscous effects in the brane world lead to important differences in the cosmological dynamics , as compared to the standard general relativistic cosmology .",
    "since the effects of the extra - dimensions and also the viscous effects are more important at high matter densities , the most important contribution to the energy density of the matter in this regime comes from the quadratic term in density .",
    "consequently , during the early period of evolution of the brane world the energy density of matter is proportional to the hubble parameter , in opposition to the standard general relativistic case with energy density proportional to the square of the hubble parameter .",

    "for times @xmath169 the anisotropy is a monotonically decreasing function of time , and thus in the large time limit the anisotropic brane world universe will end in an homogeneous and isotropic state .",
    "as has already been pointed out in @xcite , this behavior is specific for brane world cosmological models and can not be found in conventional general relativistic scenarios . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the brane universe starts from a state of maximum anisotropy , also reaching in the long time limit an isotropic phase .",
    "due to the expansion of the universe , the shear scalar @xmath85 vanishes in the large time limit , @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "according to the formal definition of the isotropization given by collins and hawking @xcite a cosmological model approaches isotropy if the following four conditions hold as @xmath156 : i ) the universe is expanding indefinetely and @xmath172 ii ) @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath175 represents an average velocity of the matter relative to the surfaces of homogeneity .",
    "if this does not tend to zero , the universe would not appear homogeneous or isotropic iii ) the anisotropy in the locally measured hubble constant @xmath176 tends to zero , @xmath177 and iv ) the distortion part of the metric tends to a constant .",
    "all these conditions are satisfied in the present model , since in the large time limit the bulk viscous brane universe is expanding and the energy density of the matter is positive for all times . moreover , as one",
    "can immediately see from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) the quantity @xmath176 is proportional to the square root of the anisotropy parameter , @xmath178 and in the large time for all values of the parameter @xmath116 it tends to zero , @xmath177 . as for the condition iv ) , it is also satisfied since in the metric we have considered only the volume part .",
    "spatially homogeneous models can be divided in three classes : those which have less than the escape velocity ( i.e. , those whose rate of expansion is insufficient to prevent them from recollapsing ) , those which have just the escape velocity and those which have more than the escape velocity @xcite . models of the third class do not tend , generally , to isotropy .",
    "in fact the only types which can tend toward isotropy at arbitrarily large times are types @xmath179 , @xmath79 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 . for type @xmath181",
    "there is no nonzero measure set of these models which tends to isotropy @xcite . in this sense",
    "the bianchi type i model we have studied in the present paper is a very special case .",
    "the bianchi types that drive flat and open universes away from isotropy in the collins - hawking sense are those of type @xmath182 .    as a consequence of its energy density dependence ,",
    "the bulk viscous pressure is a decreasing function of time for all values of the parameters and for large times it tends to zero .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath57 essentially depends on the constant @xmath116 . for @xmath183 , the time scale",
    "in which @xmath184 is very short .",
    "the variation of the temperature , presented in fig .",
    "4 , shows that at the initial times of the cosmological evolution the temperature is an increasing function of time , reaching a maximum value at a finite time @xmath185 . for times",

    "the comoving entropy , represented in fig .",
    "5 , is an increasing function of time in the early stages of cosmological evolution , but it tends to a constant value in the large time limit .",
    "the transition from the anisotropic to the isotropic state of the brane world is associated to a large increase in the entropy .",
    "the increase of the comoving entropy of the cosmological fluid is independent of the value of the parameter @xmath116 and is a general feature of the model . in the large time limit @xmath186 and , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ entrop ] ) , in this limit @xmath187    the equation of state of the zeldovich fluid with @xmath188 is equivalent to the equation of state of a massless scalar field @xmath189 , with @xmath190 and a dissipative coupling @xcite , with @xmath189 satisfying the equation @xmath191    the evolution of the scalar field can be obtained again in parametric form .",
    "classically , bulk viscous stresses arise because the expansion of the universe is continually trying to pull the fluid out of thermal equilibrium , and the cosmological fluid is trying to relax back .",
    "hence the viscosity of a classical fluid arises from the differential motion of fluid elements .",
    "but in the collisionless periods after the planck era and during inflation there are no particle interactions responsible for the viscosity .",
    "however , the phenomenological description of quantum particle production processes can be consistently modeled by means of bulk viscosities @xcite , @xcite . in particular",
    ", the full causal thermodynamics can be reformulated as a theory describing particle production @xcite . in this formulation",
    "the causal bulk viscous pressure @xmath57 in the energy conservation equation ( [ drho ] ) acts as a creation pressure @xmath192 , @xmath193 , while the particle production rate @xmath194 is proportional to the bulk viscous pressure divided by the locally measured hubble parameter .",
    "the particle balance equation , describing the variation of the particle number due to the combined effects of the expansion of the universe and particle production , takes the form @xmath195 where @xmath196 @xcite .    as an example of particle creation processes on the brane we consider particle production from a scalar field obeying an equation of state of the form @xmath197 , @xmath198 , where @xmath199 and @xmath200 , with @xmath201 the self - interaction potential . the deviation from the conformal invariance of the field or the polarization ( trace anomaly ) of quantized fields interacting with dynamic spacetimes will lead to particle production @xcite .",
    "the rate of particle creation in a particular mode depends on its frequency in relation to the expansion rate of the universe : at any given time @xmath166 in the quantum regime , new particles with frequency @xmath202 are created from the quantum vacuum , while particles produced earlier interact and have an expansionary dynamics . whether the newly created particles can reach effective thermal equilibrium depends on the rate of their interaction relative to the rate of expansion .    to obtain a phenomenological classical description of the essentially quantum creation process",
    ", we assume again that the negative creation pressure is proportional to the energy density of the scalar field , @xmath203 , where , for simplicity , we suppose that all @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath116 are constants .",

    "therefore the temperature of the very early universe is given by @xmath216    in the particular case @xmath217 , corresponding to a dissipative scalar field obeying an equation of state of the form @xmath218 , the time variation of the energy density of the field is @xmath219 , while the creation pressure varies as @xmath220 . in order to have a decaying field",
    "it is necessary that @xmath114 . even in the presence of particle creation processes ,",
    "the initial expansion of the brane universe is non - inflationary .",
    "but in the large time limit , for large values of @xmath79 and for a decaying creation pressure with @xmath221 , the deceleration parameter becomes @xmath222 /2 $ ] . for @xmath223 ,",
    "the brane universe ends in an inflationary epoch .",
    "since the dynamics on the brane is different from the standard general relativistic one , the particle creation processes are also influenced by the effects of the extra dimensions . because the rate of expansion is higher ,",
    "the particle creation processes are also accelerated in the models with large extra dimensions .    in the present paper",
    "we have pointed out an other important difference between brane world cosmology and standard general relativity predictions about the very early universe , namely the behavior of the temperature of a realistic cosmological fluid . in brane world",
    "cosmological models , the high density universe starts from a low temperature state . in the initial stages of expansionary evolution",
    "the increase of the degree of anisotropy is associated to an increase of the temperature of the universe , the cosmological fluid experiencing a heating process .",
    "an other interesting feature of the model is the presence of a non - singular energy density , associated to a singularity of the scale factors .",
    "the present approach can also lead to a better understanding of the entropy generation mechanisms in the very early universe , where viscous type physical processes have probably played an important role even when the universe was about @xmath224 old @xcite .",
    "hence dissipative viscous brane world cosmological model with an anisotropic geometry could maybe describe a well - determined period of the very early evolution of our universe .",
