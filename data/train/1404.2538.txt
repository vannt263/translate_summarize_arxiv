    "a wide range of cosmological observations in the universe , including large scale structures , the cosmic microwave background and the isotopic abundances resulting from the primordial nucleosynthesis , provide an evidence for a sizable non - baryonic and extremely - weakly interacting cold dark matter ( dm)@xcite .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )",
    "provide a theoretically appealing class of candidates for the obscure nature of dm@xcite , with the lightest supersymmetric neutralino ( @xmath0 ) often taken as a useful template for such a wimp .",
    "it is often argued that the thermal production of wimps in the early universe generically leads to a relic density that coincides with the observed order of magnitude of dm fraction on cosmological scales , @xmath1 , to the total energy density of the universe@xcite .",
    "the indirect search for dm is one of the main items in the broad fermi large area telescope ( lat)@xcite science menu  @xcite .",
    "it is complementary to direct searches for the recoil of wimps off the nuclei being carried out in underground facilities  @xcite and at collider experiments searches for missing transverse energy . in this review",
    "the word `` indirect '' denotes search for a signature of wimp annihilation or decay processes through the final products ( gamma rays , electrons and positrons ) of such processes .    among possible messengers for such indirect searches , gamma rays",
    "play a pronounced role as they propagate essentially unperturbed through the galaxy and therefore directly point to their sources , leading to distinctive spatial signatures ; an even more important aspect , as we will see , is the appearance of pronounced spectral signatures .    among many other ground - based and space - borne instruments ,",
    "the lat plays a prominent role in this search through a variety of distinct search targets : gamma - ray lines , galactic and isotropic diffuse gamma - ray emission , dwarf satellites , cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and positrons .",
    "the lat is a pair - conversion gamma - ray telescope designed to measure gamma rays in the energy range from @xmath2 to more than @xmath3 . in this paper a brief description of the lat",
    "is given , while full details can be found in@xcite .",
    "the lat is composed of a @xmath4 array of @xmath5 identical towers designed to convert incident gamma rays into @xmath6 pairs , and to determine their arrival directions and energies .",
    "each tower hosts a tracker module and a calorimeter module .",
    "each tracker module consists of @xmath7 x - y planes of silicon - strip detectors , interleaved with tungsten converter foils , for a total on - axis thickness equivalent to @xmath8 radiation lengths ( r.l . ) .",
    "each calorimeter module , @xmath9 r.l . on - axis thick , hosts @xmath10 csi(tl ) crystals , hodoscopically arranged in @xmath11 perpendicular layers .",
    "the instrument is surrounded by a segmented anti - coincidence detector that tags the majority of the charged - particle background .",
    "the field of view is @xmath12 and lat observes the entire sky about every 3 hours ( 2 orbits ) .",
    "these features make the lat a highly - sensitive instrument for dark matter searches .",
    "the operation of the instrument during the first five years of the mission was smooth .",
    "the lat has been collecting science data for more than 99% of the time spent outside the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "the remaining tiny fractional down - time accounts for both hardware issues and detector calibrations@xcite .    over the first five years of mission",
    "the lat collaboration has put a considerable effort toward a better understanding of the instrument and of the environment in which it operates .",
    "in addition to that a continuous effort was made in order to make the advances public as soon as possible . in august 2011 the first new event classification ( pass-7 ) since launch was released , along with the corresponding instrument response functions .",
    "later , in fall 2013 , a new version of pass-7 event classification was released ( pass-7 reprocessed ) with improved calibrations for the light yield and asymmetry in the calorimeter crystals@xcite .",
    "the new calorimeter calibrations improve the in - flight point - spread function ( psf ) above @xmath13 gev and correct for the small ( @xmath14 1% per year ) , expected degradation in the light yield of the calorimeter crystals measured in flight data .",
    "consequently , the absolute energy scale has shifted upwards by a few percent in an energy and in a time - dependent manner .",
    "in addition , the re - calibration of the calorimeter light asymmetry leads to a statistical re - shuffling of the events classiffied as photons .",
    "the high - energy gamma - ray sky is dominated by diffuse emission : more than 70% of the photons detected by the lat are produced in the interstellar space of our galaxy by interactions of high - energy cosmic rays with matter and low - energy radiation fields . an additional diffuse component with an almost - isotropic distribution ( and therefore thought to be extragalactic in origin )",
    "accounts for another significant fraction of the lat photon sample .",
    "the rest consists of various different types of point - like or extended sources : active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and normal galaxies , pulsars and their relativistic wind nebulae , globular clusters , binary systems , shock - waves remaining from supernova explosions and nearby solar - system bodies like the sun and the moon .    the second fermi - lat catalog ( 2fgl)@xcite contains 1873 sources detected and characterized in the energy range from 100 mev to 100 gev .",
    "amonge these sources , 127 are considered as being firmly identified and 1171 as being reliably associated with counterparts of known or likely gamma - ray - producing source classes .",

    "furthermore , the uncertainties in the signal and background morphologies make the identification of a dm signal from the inner galaxy a challenging task .    a conservative limit on dm can be set assuming that all gamma - ray emission in a region around the gc might come from dark matter .",
    "therefore the expected dm signal must not exceed the observed gamma - ray emission@xcite .",
    "the target regions in ref .",
    "were optimized according to four dark matter profile models , i.e. the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite , the einasto profile @xcite , the burkert profile @xcite and a compressed nfw ( nfwc ) profile .",

    "depending on the models of the galactic magnetic field , the thermal cross - section is excluded for a wimp mass smaller than about 150 to 400 gev .",
    "the upper limits on the annihilation cross section of dark matter particles obtained are two orders of magnitude stronger than those without contraction .",
    "improved modeling of the galactic diffuse emission as well as the potential contribution from other astrophysical sources ( for instance unresolved point sources ) could provide more constraining limits .              in order to minimize uncertainties connected with the region of the galactic center , the analysis in ref .",
    "considered a region of interest consisting of two off - plane rectangles ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) and searched for a continuous emission from dm annihilation or decay in the smooth galactic dark matter halo .",
    "they implemented two different approaches . in the first case",
    "a conservative choice was taken and limits were set on dm models assuming that all the gamma ray emission in the region might come from dark matter ( i.e. no astrophysical signal is modeled and subtracted ) . in the second approach dark matter source and astrophysical emission were fit simultaneously to the data , marginalizing over several relevant parameters of the astrophysical emission . as no robust signal of dm emission was found , dm limits were set ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fixedsourcelimits ] ) .",
    "these limits are particularly strong on leptonic dm channels , which are hard to constrain in most other probes ( notably in the analysis of the dwarf galaxies , described below ) .",
    "this analysis strongly challenges dm interpretation@xcite of the positron rise observed by pamela  @xcite and the @xmath51 spectrum observed by fermi lat  @xcite .",
    "many complications associated with the gc are avoided when looking at point - like targets outside the galactic disk .",
    "the corresponding signals are typically considerably fainter , which is however compensated by the greatly simplified and much smaller astrophysical background .",
    "probably most promising source candidate target class are nearby milky way dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies .",
    "this is because their mass - to - light ratio is predicted to be from 10 to 1000  @xcite , implying that they could be largely dm dominated .",
    "moreover , since no significant gamma - ray emission of astrophysical origin is expected ( these systems host few stars and no hot gas ) , the detection of a gamma - ray signal could provide a clean dm signature .",
    "the lat detected no significant emission from any of such systems and the upper limits on the @xmath17-ray flux allowed us to put very stringent constraints on the parameter space of some well motivated wimp models .",
    "in particular , a combined analysis of all known dwarf satellites with the fermi - lat , that also incorporates the uncertainties in the j - factors for these objects , has pushed the annihilation cross section limits below the canonical thermal relic production cross - section for a range of wimp masses ( around 10 gev ) for the annihilation into some channels which often act as a benchmark  @xcite .",

    "this happens because the larmor radius for a typical value of 4 @xmath68 for the gmf and for a 100 gev singly - charged particle is @xmath69 pc , considerably smaller than the typical distance to a nearby source ( of the order of a hundred pc ) .    for energies",

    "( see for example ref .  ) , any anisotropy in the arrival directions of the detected cres is a powerful tool to discriminate between a dark matter origin and an astrophysical one .",

    "early analyses discussed several interpretations of the fermi results based either on a single large scale galactic cre component or by invoking additional electron - positron primary sources , e.g. nearby pulsars or particle dark matter annihilation  @xcite .",

    "the neutrinos would escape and might be seen in a detector  @xcite such as macro  @xcite , super - k  @xcite or icecube  @xcite .",
    "such a point source with a hard spectrum would be convincing evidence that the neutrinos originated from dm .",
    "dm builds up in the sun when a wimp traveling through either body collides with a nucleus and loses enough energy to become gravitationally bound .",
    "it then orbits the center of the object , undergoing multiple collisions .",
    "the production rate depends on both the dm annihilation cross section and the dm - nucleon scattering cross section .    a class of models in which dm annihilates to cres through a new light intermediate state @xmath74 @xcite has been considered to explain the excesses in local cre fluxes reported by pamela  @xcite atic  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite .",
    "in these scenarios dm particles captured by the sun through elastic scattering interactions would annihilate to @xmath74 pairs in the sun s core , and if the @xmath74 could escape the surface of the sun before decaying to cres , these models could produce an observable cre flux .    another class of models in which dm scatters off of nucleons predominantly via inelastic scattering has been proposed as a means of reconciling the results of dama and dama / libra  @xcite with cdms - ii  @xcite and other experiments ( e.g. , ref .   and ref .  ; see also ref .   for a comprehensive discussion of experimental constraints ) . if dm is captured by the sun only through inelastic scattering ( idm ) , this could lead to a non - negligible fraction of dm annihilating outside of the sun s surface . for models in which idm annihilates to cres ,",
    "an observable flux at energies above a few tens of gev could be produced .    during its first year of operation ,",

    "furthermore , a directional analysis of the high - energy cre events was performed in the galactic reference frame  @xcite , and showed no evidence of anisotropies .",
    "since the sun is moving with respect to the galactic reference frame , the previously - reported absence of anisotropies in the cre flux observed in the galactic frame does not necessarily imply a negative result .",
    "therefore a dedicated analysis to search for flux variations on cre correlated with the sun s direction has been perfomed  @xcite , using two complementary analysis approaches : ( i ) flux asymmetry analysis and ( ii ) comparison of the solar flux with the isotropic flux .",
    "the first approach compares the cre flux from the sun with the flux evaluated in a sky position opposite to that of the sun .",
    "the second approach used in this analysis is based on the event - shuffling technique employed in ref .  , which was used to build a simulated sample of isotropic cres starting from the real events .",
    "simulated events are built by randomly coupling the arrival times and the arrival directions ( in local instrument coordinates ) of real events .",
    "both analyses did not provide any evidence of a cre excess from the sun , so statistical upper limits have been set .",
    "constraints on dm model parameters by comparing upper limits on solar cre fluxes to the predicted fluxes of the two dm annihilation scenarios considered in ref .   have been calculated : ( 1 ) capture of dm particles by the sun via elastic scattering interactions and subsequent annihilation to @xmath51 through an intermediate state @xmath74 , and ( 2 ) capture of dm particles by the sun via inelastic scattering interactions and subsequent annihilation of the captured dm particles outside the sun directly to @xmath51 . in ref .",

    "we consider only the case of @xmath51 from annihilation of dm particles captured by the sun but with orbits which take them outside the surface of the sun . in a standard wimp scenario , dm particles captured by the sun via elastic scattering quickly undergo subsequent scatterings which cause them to settle to the core , and hence the fraction of captured dm particles outside the surface of the sun at any given time is negligible @xcite .    for a dm particle @xmath0 to scatter inelastically off a nucleon @xmath77 via the process @xmath78 , the dm must have energy @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",

    ", the captured particles will be unable to thermalize and settle to the core , and instead will remain on relatively large orbits . as a result ,",
    "the density of captured dm particles outside the sun may not be negligible in an idm scenario , and the annihilation of those particles to @xmath51 could thus produce an observable flux of cres from the direction of the sun . while it is not necessary for dm to annihilate primarily to @xmath51 in order to explain the direct detection results ( since direct detection experiments are not sensitive to the dominant annihilation channels ) , leptophilic idm is strongly motivated since it could provide a consistent interpretation of multiple data sets @xcite .    .",
    "models above the curves produce a solar cre flux that exceeds the @xmath82 cl flux upper limit for a @xmath83 roi centered on the sun in one or more energy bins .",
    "reprinted from ref .  .",
    "[ fig : idmlim],scaledwidth=90.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : idmlim ] shows the constraints from the solar cre flux upper limits on idm models in the @xmath31-@xmath84 parameter space for three values of @xmath85 .",
    "these limits exclude the regions of parameter space compatible with the results of dama / libra and cdms ( in addition to several other direct detection experiments ) as determined by ref .   for @xmath86 , for the range of masses accessible to our analysis ( @xmath87 ) , assuming the dominant annihilation channel is @xmath51 .",
    "models consistent with both dama / libra and cdms at 90% cl exist for values of @xmath85 ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89  @xcite ; for masses from 70  gev to 250 gev the range of allowed scattering cross - sections is from @xmath90 to @xmath91 @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "although the uncertainties in the calculation of the dm fluxes in this scenario are significant , we emphasize that constraining @xmath93 is sufficient to exclude the cross - sections of models consistent with both data sets .",
    "the bounds we derive exclude the relevant cross - sections by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , and hence we conclude that the parameter space of models preferred by dama / libra can be confidently ruled out for @xmath87 for annihilation to @xmath51 despite the uncertainties in the flux calculation .",
    "recently the xenon100 collaboration  @xcite sets the most stringent limit based on 225 days of operating time on the spin - independent elastic wimp - nucleon scattering cross section for wimp masses above 8 @xmath94 , with a minimum of @xmath95 at 55 @xmath94 and 90% confidence level .",
    "this analysis constrains dm models in which the primary annihilation channel is to @xmath51 .",
    "we emphasize that although other annihilation channels can be probed by gamma - ray @xcite or neutrino @xcite measurements , the upper limits on solar cre fluxes provide a uniquely strong constraint on the @xmath51 final state , which is inaccessible to neutrino telescopes since no neutrinos are produced for this annihilation channel .",
    "the fermi lat team has looked for indirect dm signals using a wide variety of methods , and since no signals have been detected , strong constraints have been set .",
    "fermi turned five years in orbit on june , 2013 , and it is definitely living up to its expectations in terms of scientific results delivered to the community .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration will provide an improved event reconstruction ( pass 8)  @xcite , that will improve the potential of the lat instrument .",
    "the fermi lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
