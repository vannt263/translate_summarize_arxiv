    "the recent development of metamaterials with negative refractive index has confirmed that structures can be fabricated and interpreted as having both a negative effective permittivity , @xmath4 , and a negative effective permeability , @xmath5 , simultaneously . since the original microwave experiments for the demonstration of negative index behavior in the split ring resonators ( srrs ) and wires structures ,",
    "new designs have been introduced , such as the short - wire pairs and the fishnet , that have pushed the existence of the negative refractive index into optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , both experiment and simulation results show that losses increase as the frequency increases . the transmission loss , @xmath6",
    ", at low frequencies @xcite is small ( of the order of 1 - 5 db/@xmath7 ) , while as the frequency increases the loss increases , approaching values of almost 30 db/@xmath7 at infrared frequencies @xcite .",
    "another factor to measure loss , namely the figure of merit , is the ratio of real and imaginary parts of the refractive index , @xmath8 , drops from the order of 100 for srrs at microwave frequency to 0.5 for the fishnet structure at optical frequency @xcite .",
    "so loss becomes a serious problem , which limits the potential applications of metamaterials such as perfect lens @xcite .",
    "therefore we need to determine ways to reduce the losses , especially at high frequencies .    , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "in this manuscript , we tackle this problem and study the losses in the fishnet structures through numerical simulations .",
    "our numerical simulations were completed with cst microwave studio ( computer simulation technology gmbh , darmstadt , germany ) , which uses a finite - integration technique . in fig .",
    "[ fig1_geom ] , we show the structures of the short - wire pairs and the fishnet designs .",
    "the fishnet structure consists of double layer of infinite long metallic wire arrays along two orthogonal directions spaced by a dielectric spacer @xcite .",
    "the wires along the magnetic field @xmath9 direction act as a magnetic resonator , providing negative permeability @xmath5 due to anti - parallel currents induced by the magnetic field of the incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "the wires along the electric field @xmath10 direction of the incident electromagnetic wave excite the plasmonic response and produce negative permittivity @xmath4 up to the plasma frequency .",
    "the fishnet structure has an intrinsic relation with the short - wire pairs @xcite and the split ring resonator ( srrs ) structure .",
    "the short - wire pairs geometry can be viewed as an extreme case of a two - gap srr ring @xcite shrunk along the direction of the gaps . by adding continuous wires , which provide negative permittivity @xmath4 , one is able to obtain the negative refractive index , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the fishnet structure can be obtained by increasing the width of the short wires , @xmath12 , to form continuous wires along the @xmath9 direction and by adding other continuous wires along the @xmath10 direction @xcite .",
    "the transformation from the two - gap srr to the short - wire pairs and the fishnet structure has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",

    "[ fig2_l_s_dependence],title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    before we present the results for the fishnet structures , we will present the dependence of the magnetic resonance frequency on the width and its length of the short - wire pair .",
    "the short - wire pairs give a magnetic resonance response @xcite , and can give a negative @xmath5 .",
    "the short - wire pairs structure has an interesting property that the resonance frequency , @xmath13 , depends only on the length of the short - wire , @xmath14 , among the geometric parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2_l_s_dependence](b ) , the resonance frequency @xmath13 , is a linear function of @xmath22 , over a large range of @xmath14 . on the other hand , we barely observe any change of @xmath13 with the other parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig2_l_s_dependence](c ) shows the the magnetic resonance frequencies @xmath13 as the separation @xmath19 increases from 0.2 mm to 2.6 mm .",
    "one can see that although @xmath19 increases by a factor of 13 , @xmath13 only changes around 5% ( from 13.6 to 14.54 ghz ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the capacitance , @xmath24 , and the inductance , @xmath25 , have the opposite dependence on the width , @xmath12 , and separation between the two short - wire pairs , @xmath19 ( @xmath19 is also the thickness of the dielectric spacer ) as shown in fig . [ fig1_geom](a ) .",
    "the total capacitance of the series @xmath26 circuit is given by @xmath27 and the total inductance is @xmath28 , so the resonance frequency is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the speed of light in the vacuum and @xmath18 and @xmath31 are the dielectric function and relative permeability of the dielectric spacer , respectively @xcite . as a transformation of the short - wire pairs structure ,",
    "the fishnet structure has the same property , i.e. , the resonance frequency @xmath13 does not depend on the separation , @xmath19 .",
    "this property gives us the opportunity to change @xmath1 and @xmath2 simultaneously without affecting the resonance frequency by changing the separation , @xmath19 .",
    "the short - wire pairs structure does not give a negative @xmath11 , but they give a negative @xmath5 , all the way to the optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate all of our efforts in trying to reduce the losses in the fishnet design , which is the best design so far , for giving a negative @xmath11 at the optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "the magnetic element of the fishnet structure ( i.e. the long wires along the @xmath9 direction ) , can be modeled as the same series @xmath26 circuit as the short - wire pairs shown in fig . [ fig2_l_s_dependence](a ) .",
    "as we know , the loss of the @xmath26 circuit depends upon the value of each circuit element and the quality factor , @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 . by increasing the inductance @xmath1 or reducing the resistance @xmath0 and capacitance @xmath2",
    ", we are able to increase the @xmath32-factor and therefore reduce losses .",
    "the resistance of the metallic structure depends on the conductivity and the frequency because of the skin effect , so we can choose a good conductor such as copper , silver or gold to reduce the resistance @xcite .",
    "the inductance , @xmath1 , and the capacitance @xmath2 , strongly depend on the geometric parameters of the structure and are relatively easy to be changed by modifying these parameters .",
    "in the fishnet structure , the long wire along the @xmath9 direction is like a magnetic resonator , which provides the negative @xmath5 by introducing a magnetic resonance over a finite frequency band .",
    "the magnetic permeability is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the magnetic resonance resonance frequency and @xmath36 is the damping factor , which is inversely proportional to the effective inductance , @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "so we are able to reduce the loss by increasing the inductance of the structure .",
    "there is a special reason for choosing the fishnet structure in our study of the losses .",
    "since the loss increases as the magnetic resonance frequency increases @xcite , we must compare the loss of metamaterials with different geometric parameters at the same resonance frequency .",
    "because the fishnet structure has an intrinsic relation with the short - wire pairs , the magnetic resonance frequency @xmath13 does not change with the thickness of the dielectric spacer , @xmath19 . by increasing @xmath19 ,",
    "the effective inductance @xmath1 will increase linearly with @xmath19 , while the effective @xmath2 decreases simultaneously with @xmath19 and the product @xmath38 does not change , therefore , we are able to compare the losses at a fixed frequency .    = 0.25 (",

    "the frequency @xmath39 is normalized by the magnetic resonance frequency @xmath13 ( @xmath13 = 9.701 , 9.689 and 9.604 ghz for @xmath19=0.25 , 0.5 and 1.0 mm , respectively ) .",

    "[ fig3_s_depenence](a ) we present the effective permeability @xmath5 as a function of the normalized frequency .",
    "one can see that the magnitude of the magnetic resonance is significantly increased as the width of the dielectric spacer @xmath19 increases .",
    "[ fig3_s_depenence](b ) shows the real part of the effective refractive index , @xmath41 , calculated from numerical simulations employing a retrieval procedure @xcite , and the normalized losses , defined as the ratio of @xmath40 , where @xmath43 and @xmath0 are the transmittance and reflectance , respectively .",
    "one can see that , as the separation @xmath19 increases from 0.25 to 1.0 mm , the frequency with a given value of re(@xmath11)=-1 , shifts away from the center of the peak of the normalized loss .",
    "the underlying reason for this is the magnet resonance are becoming stronger as the inductance @xmath1 increases , so that the frequency with a given value of re(@xmath11)=-1 moves away from the resonance peak where high loss occurs .",
    "figure [ fig3_s_depenence](c ) shows that the figure of merit ( fom ) , which is defined as @xmath8 and increases dramatically from 2 to 25 .",
    "further investigations show that an optimized fishnet structure at ghz frequencies can have a fom in the order of 50 .",
    "however , according to our simulations , the srrs type metamaterial usually has a fom larger than 100 , due to the large effective inductance to effective capacitance ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "it is very difficult to fabricate and characterize the srrs at optical frequencies@xcite , so we are forced to use the fishnet design , which gives @xmath44 for perpendicular propagation .",
    "another way to increase the inductance , @xmath1 , is to increase the relative permeability , @xmath31 , of the dielectric spacer . in order to keep the resonance frequency unchanged",
    ", we must decrease the dielectric constant , @xmath18 , of the spacer accordingly , i.e. , to keep @xmath45 as a constant .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic resonance will increase dramatically as @xmath31 increases . in order to avoid the periodicity effects @xcite due to the strong magnetic resonance , we limited the range of @xmath31 to less than 2 and used a lossy material as the dielectric spacer with loss tangent , @xmath46 .",

    "( c ) figure of merit.[fig5_nm_fishnet],title=\"fig:\",width=529 ] +    it is worth to point out that one can not increase @xmath19 in the fishnet design arbitrarily .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath19 is limited by two facts .",
    "first , it is restricted by the unit cell size , @xmath52 , in the propagating direction .",
    "the unit cell size , @xmath52 , is limited by the homogenous assumption of left - handed materials , i.e. @xmath53 , and also by the requirement of negative permittivity , which is provided by the long wires along the electric field direction and will be diluted by a large unit cell .",
    "second , according to our simulations , as @xmath19 increases up to a certain value larger than the width of wires , @xmath12 , the magnetic resonance will disappear .",
    "this is due to the fact that the short wires are decoupled from each other as @xmath54 .",
    "in summary , we proposed a simple and efficient way to reduce losses in the left - handed metamaterial designs by increasing the inductance to the capacitance ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the figure of merit of the fishnet structure can be as large as 50 at microwave frequencies .",
    "our method is also valid in the infrared and in the optical regime , we should be able to obtain a figure of merit of 2.5 at @xmath7=484 nm , which improved the figure of merit by a factor of 5 , comparing with the best result at @xmath7=784 nm so far .",
    "although our approach is presented using the fishnet structure , it s a generic method and can also apply to other type left - handed material designs such as srrs .",
