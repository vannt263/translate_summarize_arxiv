    "contrarily to abstract graphs ( as erds - rnyi graphs or planar maps ) where the positions of vertices have no importance and where only the topology of the structure matters , the geometric random graphs are embedded into a state space .",

    ", the geometric analysis is central .",
    "the interest of the scientific community for these graphs has recently increased because of the huge variety of modern applications where they appear ( biology , image analysis , telecommunications ... ) .",
    "the present paper focuses on geometric random trees embedded in @xmath0 and on their semi - infinite branches .    when each vertex of a given geometric random tree @xmath1 built on a countable vertex set , has finite degree then @xmath1 automatically admits at least one semi - infinite branch . except this elementary result ,",
    "describing the semi - infinite branches of @xmath1 is not a trivial problem .",
    "an important step was taken by howard and newman in @xcite .",
    "they develop a robust and efficient method ( proposition 2.8 ) ensuring that a geometric random tree @xmath1 satisfies the two following statements : 0.15 cm    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     0.15 cm the main hypothesis to get @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] is that the tree @xmath1 has to be _ straight _ ( see section 2.3 of @xcite ) . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that the subtrees of @xmath1 are becoming thinner when their roots are far away from the one of @xmath1 . stating that a geometric random tree is straight generally requires an accurate study of the fluctuations of its branches .    in the last 15 years",
    ", the straight character of many geometric random trees has been established . among these trees , we can distinguished two different classes .",
    "those of _ type i _ have a graph structure resulting from local rules whereas those of _ type ii _ are built from a first or last - passage percolation procedure .",
    "besides , we will call of geodesics instead of branches in the case of trees of type ii .",
    "let us give some examples of trees belonging to these two types . among the following trees , some of them admit a @xmath4-dimensional version but , for our purpose , we focus on the case @xmath5 . in the sequel , @xmath6 denotes a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) in @xmath0 with intensity @xmath7 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first example of type i in the literature is the _ radial spanning tree _ ( rst ) .",
    "it has been introduced by baccelli and bordenave in @xcite to modelize communication networks .",

    "these trees are straight whenever @xmath12 is not too large ( theorem 5 ) . in section [",

    "then , in the rpt , @xmath17 is linked to the element of @xmath18 having the largest euclidean norm . the main motivation to study",
    "this model comes from the fact it is closely related in a sense which will be specified in section [ sect : prooflpp ] to a directed forest introduced by ferrari and its coauthors in @xcite .",
    "we state that the rpt is straight in theorem [ theo : rptstraight ] of section [ sect : rptstraight ] .",
    "let us cite a latest example of geometric random tree of type i defined by coletti and valencia in @xcite , but whose straight character is not established yet .    in @xcite , howard and",
    "newman applied their method leading to statements @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ]  to a new class of geometric random trees that we call here _ euclidean first - passage percolation trees_. in these trees , the geodesic joining each vertex @xmath17 of a ppp @xmath6 to the root @xmath19 , which is the closest point of @xmath6 to the origin @xmath8 , is defined as the path @xmath20 minimizing the weight @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a given parameter . among various results about these trees proved in @xcite ,",
    "their straight character is stated in theorem 2.6 .",
    "a second example of type ii is given by pimentel in @xcite .",
    "first , the author associates i.i.d .",
    "nonnegative random variables to the edges of the delaunay triangulation built from the ppp @xmath6 .",
    "thus , he links each vertex @xmath23 of the triangulation to the closest one to the origin @xmath8 by a fpp procedure . in section 4.1",
    ", pimentel proves that the resulting geometric random tree is straight .",
    "our third example of type ii is slightly different from the previous ones since its vertex set is the deterministic grid @xmath24 .",
    "the _ directed last - passage percolation tree _ is obtained by a lpp procedure from i.i.d .",
    "exponential weights associated to the vertices of @xmath24 .",
    "this tree is known to be straight since the work of ferrari and pimentel @xcite .    as a consequence of their straight character ,",
    "all the geometric random trees mentioned above ( of both types ) satisfy @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "so , their number @xmath25 of semi - infinite branches ( or geodesics ) starting at the root and crossing the sphere @xmath26 with radius @xmath27 a.s .",

    ", we claim that the expectation of @xmath25 is sublinear w.r.t .",
    "@xmath27 : @xmath28 this result means that among all the edges crossing the sphere @xmath26 , whose mean number is of order @xmath27 ( see the remark at the end of section [ sect : sketchsublin ] ) , a very few number of them belong to semi - infinite branches ( or geodesics ) .",
    "when the law of the geometric random tree is isotropic , the limit ( [ sublinchir ] ) is deduced from the following directional result .",
    "let @xmath29 be the number of semi - infinite branches ( or geodesics ) of the considered tree starting at the root and crossing the arc of @xmath26 centered at @xmath30 and with length @xmath31 . then",

    "the method developped here leading to ( [ sublindirectional ] ) is the same for the three considered models .",
    "actually , it has already been applied to the rst in a series of articles @xcite and we are confident in the fact that it should apply to the navigation tree of @xcite and to the one of @xcite built on the delaunay triangulation .",
    "our method can be divided into four steps .",
    "the first one consists in approximating in distribution the tree @xmath1 , locally and around the point @xmath34 , by a directed forest @xmath35 with direction @xmath36 . the goal of the second step is to state that all the branches of @xmath35 are finite in the backward sense ( i.e. towards the direction @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is the only part of our method where the dimension two is used ( and even required for trees of type ii ) .",
    "the third step combines the results of these first two steps to obtain that @xmath29 tends to @xmath38 in probability with @xmath27 .",
    "finally , a uniform ( on @xmath27 ) moment condition for @xmath29 allows to strengthen this convergence to @xmath38 in the @xmath39 sense .",
    "in fact , the first step especially the proof of the approximation result and the nature of the directed forest is really different according to the type of the considered tree @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is of type i then a directed forest can naturally be associated to it . for the rpt ,",
    "this is the collection of coalescing one - dimensional random walks with uniform jumps in an interval with radius @xmath40 .",
    "this directed forest has been introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "for the rst , this is the _ directed spanning forest _ ( see section 2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath1 is of type ii , a suitable directed forest is given by the collection of semi - infinite geodesics having the same deterministic direction and starting at all the vertices .",
    "the existence of these semi - infinite geodesics is given by @xmath3 $ ] and then requires the straight character of @xmath1 .",
    "their uniqueness ( stated in proposition [ prop : directiondeterm ] ) is crucial to get the approximation result . finally , it is important to remark that both proofs ( for types i and ii ) of the approximation result do not apply to the other type .",
    "in particular , a key argument used in the proof for type ii is that a geodesic from @xmath17 to @xmath23 coincides with the one from @xmath23 to @xmath17 which does not hold for type i.    in theorems [ theo : sublinrpt ] , [ theo : sublineuclfpptree ] and [ theo : sublinlpptree ] , it is also established that a.s .",
