    "recently unusual properties of carbon nanotubes attract much interest .",
    "these mesoscopic systems have demonstrated a remarkable interplay of dimensionality , interaction and disorder @xcite .",
    "the well - pronounced one - dimensional character of electron motion in single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) with strongly separated levels of angular quantization led to attempts to describe their behavior in terms of the luttinger liquid model @xcite .",
    "as soon as metallic swnt has two conducting channels ,  the @xmath0 luttinger liquid model may apply to this case when the interchannel coupling is negligible .",
    "experimentally , several contradictory observations of the electronic properties of swnt at low temperatures were made .",
    "such an evidence of the luttinger liquid behavior as a power law divergence of resistance when temperature fell down to @xmath1 @xmath2@xcite , was recently attributed to coulomb blockade in tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "the measured with the use of low - resistive metallic contact low - temperature resistance of individual swnt , @xcite does not manifest traces of luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "the multiwall nanotubes ( mwnt ) , composed of several concentric graphite shells show properties which are clearly consistent with the weak - localization features of diffusive transport in magnetoconductivity and zero - bias anomaly in the tunnelling density of states @xcite .",
    "the intertube coupling in mwnt was demonstrated to be essential for interpretation of experimental data on electric transport properties of mwnt @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if electrods contact only the outermost tube in mwnt , it behaves as an individual cylinder with the diameter an order of magnitude larger than that of swnt and may manifest ballistic properties @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study electron states in mwnt . in this case , contrary to swnt , the inter - tube electron hopping eliminates the specific one - dimensional properties and we may solve the corresponding spectral problem within the standard quantum mechanical many - electron approach . in order to describe",
    "the electron spectrum of mwnt one has to take into consideration that the motion of electron around the circumference of individual tube is quantized . due to the periodic boundary conditions",
    "an integer number of wavelengths must fit around the tube . along the tube , however , electronic states are not restricted and electrons can move ballistically .",
    "because of the circumferential quantization , the electron states in the tube do not form a single wide energy band .",
    "instead , they split into a number of one - dimensional sub - bands , with band onsets at different energies . in mwnt",
    "an additional effect of intertube interaction appears .",
    "it results in further splitting of energy levels .",
    "the characteristic distance between the levels is governed by the probability of electron tunnelling between adjacent tubes .",
    "we model the metallic mwnt as a set of equidistant coaxial cylinders with attractive kronig - penney type potential along the radius and study the electron states of such a system .",
    "we develop an universal formalism for numerical evaluation of electron energy levels .",
    "it allows to calculate energy level splitting due to intertube hopping for mwnt with any number of coaxial tubes .",
    "then we consider the filling of the obtained band structure by electrons and calculate such electronic properties as the one - particle density of states , electronic contribution to entropy and , finally , the tunnelling conductivity of mwnt .",
    "we also prove the possibility of direct determination of the electron spectrum in mwnt by means of the tunnelling microscopy and formulate the corresponding criterion on experimental temperatures .",

    "the number of cylinders @xmath3 is arbitrary .",
    "electrons are held to the cylinders by a singular attractive potential .",
    "the single electron hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath4 here @xmath3 is the number of coaxial tubes and @xmath5 are their radii .",
    "the radius of the inner tube is @xmath6 and the adjacent tubes are separated by distance @xmath7 .",
    "we shall assume that the potential is strong .",

    "the schrdinger equation for electron reads : @xmath9 we shall solve the problem in cylindrical coordinates with @xmath10-axis pointing along the tube .",
    "let us take the electron wave function in the form @xmath11 the electron has momentum @xmath12 and moves freely along the tube .",
    "the angular motion of the electron is characterized by magnetic quantum number @xmath13 .",
    "the potential affects only the radial part of the wave function : @xmath14 note that the electrons are localized on the tubes and the right hand side of the equation is negative .",
    "the potential energy may be characterized by the effective width of @xmath15-wells : @xmath16 it may be seen from the corresponding one - dimensional problem that @xmath17 controls the spread of wave functions out of the tubes .",
    "large values of @xmath18 correspond to the case @xmath19 .",
    "another important quantity is the spectral parameter .",
    "it has the dimension of inverse length : @xmath20 the spectral parameter sets the radial scale for wave function and its values determine the discrete component of energy spectrum .",
    "our goal is to find @xmath21 as a function of @xmath17 depending on the system geometry .",
    "after the standard rescaling @xmath22 the equation for @xmath23 takes the form : @xmath24 we shall describe square integrable solutions of this equation in the next section .",
    "the potential on the right hand side of equation ( [ x - eqn ] ) is zero almost everywhere excluding the points @xmath25 . between the tubes the equation is of the modified bessel type .",

    "the first @xmath3 relations between @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 on the next interval come from the continuity of solutions , @xmath37 . substituting ( [ superposition ] ) for @xmath38 we get : @xmath39    the second set of conditions is obtained from matching the derivatives @xmath40 .",

    "the requirement of regularity of the wave function at zero and infinity results in two more relations .",
    "remember that the modified bessel function @xmath47 is regular at @xmath48 and grows at @xmath49 whereas @xmath50 , on the contrary , is singular at @xmath48 but goes to zero at infinity .",
    "hence one must set @xmath51    it may be easily seen that the listed @xmath29 equations are not independent .",
    "namely , rescaling all @xmath52 , @xmath53 does not break the equalities .",
    "the missing requirement that helps to fix the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the normalization condition @xmath56    we shall show how to solve equations ( [ continuity ] , [ derivatives ] , [ boundary ] ) in the next section .",
    "the standard way to find the spectrum of the described system of homogenous equations would be to study the dependence of its determinant on spectral parameter .",
    "we propose a recursive procedure that allows to deduce the spectral equation without calculating the determinant .",
    "the wave functions of electrons in the system of @xmath3 coaxial nanotubes are given by formula ( [ superposition ] ) where @xmath29 coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 may be found up to a factor from the following system of @xmath29 homogenous linear equations ( we summarize once more ( [ continuity ] , [ derivatives ] , [ boundary ] ) ) :    [ system ] @xmath57    this system has nonzero solutions only provided that its rank is less than @xmath29 .",
    "thus we arrive at a symbolic equation @xmath58 .",
    "the determinant of the lhs is an @xmath3-th order polynomial of @xmath59 with complicated ( due to the presence of bessel functions ) coefficients that depend on @xmath60 and on geometrical parameters of the system .",
    "zeros of this function with respect to @xmath60 determine the energy spectrum of the system .    an alternative way to obtain the spectral equation without calculating",
    "the determinant is to eliminate variables .",
    "this may be done recursively .",
    "equations ( [ systema ] , [ systemb ] ) link coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 to @xmath30 , @xmath31 on the next interval .",
    "applying them successively one can express all @xmath30 , @xmath31 in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",

    "every new tube brings an extra power of @xmath82 .",
    "thus after @xmath83 recursions we obtain a polynomial of power @xmath83 in @xmath84 .",
    "the last thing is to impose the boundary condition ( [ systemd ] ) .",
    "this determines the spectrum of the system .",
    "we have already explained that @xmath85 is an @xmath3-th order polynomial in @xmath86 .",
    "however its coefficients contain bessel functions that depend on @xmath87 and one may not be sure that the equation @xmath88 always has @xmath3 roots in @xmath60 .",
    "there are @xmath3 values of @xmath89 such that @xmath90 . ] still , as we shall see later , the roots lie close to each other and variations of bessel functions are negligible . hence in a system of @xmath3 coaxial nanotubes",
    "each radial energy level is , in general , split into @xmath3 ones .",
    "let us analyze the electronic spectrum for a nanotube of radius @xmath91 . taking the wave function in form ( [ psi ] ) we obtain the equation for radial part : @xmath92 the wave function inside and outside the tube looks as follows :    [ 1tbpsi ] @xmath93    coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 must satisfy equations ( [ system ] ) with @xmath94 .",

    "this means that @xmath99 we have already mentioned that when searching for the spectrum we may assume that @xmath100 . equating expressions ( [ 1tbdelta ] ) and ( [ delta1 ] ) for @xmath101 we arrive at the spectral equation :    [ 1tbspeqn ] @xmath102 or in terms of the original physical radius : @xmath103    solution of this equation",

    "two of them are small ( @xmath108 and lie out of the domain where asymptotic formulae ( [ asymptots ] ) hold .",

    "thus our approximation is consistent .",
    "according to equation ( [ kappa ] ) @xmath21 determines the electronic energy spectrum : @xmath115 the origin of all the four addends is transparent .",
    "the negative first term @xmath116 is the binding energy of electron in the potential well .",
    "it does not depend on the form of graphite layer .",
    "the last two terms are the kinetic energy of the electron : the longitudinal part @xmath117 varies continuously whereas the angular component @xmath118 is quantized . for the tube of radius",
    "@xmath119 the scale of quantization is @xmath120 . an interesting feature of the spectrum is the geometrical term @xmath121 that depends only on the radius of the tube . because of it electrons are bound to the tube stronger than to the plane .",

    "a new phenomenon that occurs in multiple nanotubes is the electron tunnelling . in planar systems",
    "the hopping of electrons between layers leads to splitting of degenerate energy levels .",
    "out of the planes the wave functions of electrons fall exponentially and the splitting is weak compared to the binding energy .",
    "however the latter is large by itself and the effect might be noticeable .",
    "now we are going to consider the tunnelling in coaxial nanotubes .",
    "of course the presence of curvature terms ( @xmath123 ) eliminates the degeneracy from the very beginning .",
    "still tunnelling shifts energy levels and enhances their splitting .",
    "first we shall analyze this effect in the system of two coaxial nanotubes .",
    "let the radii of the tubes be @xmath6 and @xmath124 .",
    "the parameter characteristic of tunnelling is @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the interval between the tubes .",
    "we shall analyze the electronic spectrum of the system in the first approximation with respect both to tunnelling and localization of electrons .",
    "thus we will have at our disposal two small parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "following the recipe of section  [ recursion ] we assume that @xmath100 , @xmath129 and calculate @xmath130 .",
    "the boundary conditions require it to be zero . imposing this condition",
    "gives the spectral equation we are looking for . at first glance",
    "the equation @xmath131 looks rather clumsy but it simplifies after neglecting terms of the order @xmath132 and higher : @xmath133 the coefficients of the equation depend on @xmath60 via @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "however this dependence is weak . we shall consider them as constants and substitute for @xmath60 the zeroth approximation value @xmath136 .",
    "then the equation becomes a simple quadratic one .",
    "the two solutions to it are @xmath137    calculating the energy levels from equation ( [ kappa ] ) we get : @xmath138 .",
    "\\label{2tbspectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us discuss the limiting cases .",
    "suppose that the attractive potential be strong enough to prevent tunnelling .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath139 and only @xmath140 terms ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the rotational part of kinetic energy ) should be taken into account .",
    "the two roots of equation ( [ 2tbkleqn ] ) are    [ 2tbnotunnel ] @xmath141 that corresponds to the energies @xmath142    comparing this with ( [ 1tbkleqn ] ) we see that the spectrum consists of two independent series coming from the noninteracting tubes of radii @xmath143 .",
    "this is exactly what one should expect in absence of tunnelling .",
    "the second case corresponds to large radii and small distance between the tubes .",
    "now we neglect @xmath144 .",
    "now the solutions become    [ 2tbflat ] @xmath145 and the energies are @xmath146    this coincides with the splitting of the ground level that arises in two parallel planes due to electron tunnelling between them .",
    "note , however , that because of the factor @xmath147 dropping down @xmath134 terms is legitimate only for low - lying levels whereas for large @xmath148 the kinetic part of ( [ 2tbspectrum ] ) always comes into play . when neither of the terms under the square root is small the two effects add up .",
    "thus we may conclude that tunnelling enhances the splitting of equal @xmath148 energy levels in coaxial systems .",
    "this effect is more relevant for small @xmath148 and becomes less for upper levels .    summarizing this section we notice , that the value of tunnel splitting @xmath149 depends on distance between the tubes .",
    "it reaches the maximum for @xmath150 : @xmath151 in real systems @xmath17 is on atomic scales ( several angstroms ) and @xmath152 is several nanometers",
    ". therefore probably the maximum is inaccessible . in order to increase",
    "the role of tunnelling one has to make the tubes closer to each other .",
    "we can also estimate the number @xmath148 starting from which the effect of tunnelling becomes less important and the systems behaves like the set of independent tubes . in order to obtain the upper bound",
    "let us assume that @xmath153 .",
    "then inequality ( [ 2tbnotunnelb ] ) turns into @xmath154 this is a large value . certainly in real systems with @xmath155",
    "the tubes become independent much earlier .",
    "actually for @xmath148 this big the kinetic part in ( [ 2tbnotunnelb ] ) exceeds the binding energy .",
    "therefore the total energy is positive and the entire model fails .",
    "an improvement of this estimate requires a better knowledge of @xmath17 .",
    "we see that the tunnelling of electrons between coaxial nanotubes enhances the splitting of energy levels with equal @xmath148 .",
    "this effect is stronger expressed for low - lying levels . for big",
    "@xmath148 the role of tunnelling falls down and the energy spectrum approaches the superposition of those of several noninteracting tubes .",
    "the crucial parameter for tunnelling is @xmath156 . in our model",
    "@xmath17 is a function of the energy of electron binding to conducting layers .",
    "the tunnel interaction enhances as the tubes get closer and the interval between them becomes small .",
    "an estimate for the tunnelling parameter may be obtained from the probability of electron `` hopping '' between the layers in planar systems .",
    "as it is well known the one - particle density of states ( dos ) can be expressed in terms of the imaginary part of one - electron green function . in the model of mwcn introduced above the quasiparticle spectrum",
    "has a form :    @xmath158    where @xmath159 denotes the energy related to circumferential modes quantization and splitting due to the inter - tube tunnelling .",
    "it may be numerically calculated for mwnt with any number of conducting cylinders with the help of the formalism developed in secs . 2 and 3 .",
    "index @xmath148 enumerates the levels of angular quantization , while index @xmath160 enumerates the energy levels related to electron hopping between adjacent tubes ( fine structure of energy levels ) .",
    "the electron green function is , therefore ,    @xmath161    ( @xmath162 is the time of one - electron elastic relaxation ) .",

    "we applied the green function formalism and calculated the electron spectrum , the one - particle density of states and entropy .",

    "we choose the parameters typical for mwnt : @xmath191 @xmath192 ( pseudopotential of carbon ) , @xmath193 @xmath194 , and @xmath195 @xmath194 .",
    "notice , that in this case the effective width of attractive singular potential @xmath17 is @xmath196 @xmath194 confirming our approximation of strong potential @xmath8 .",
    "one can see the resemblance between the fine structure of peaks of the theoretical density of states and experimentally observed peaks of tunnelling conductance @xcite .",
    "an important issue is the possibility of direct experimental studies of dos by methods of tunnelling spectroscopy . according to eq .",
    "( [ sigmatunn ] ) , the tunnelling conductance is the convolution of two functions depending on the electron energy .",
    "this equation results in direct proportionality between tunnelling conductance and dos in the limiting case of very low temperature .",
    "namely , the temperature should be much less than the energy scale of dos to be resolved .",
    "therefore the interpretation of results of tunnelling spectroscopy needs care . in particular , for resolving the fine structure of dos due to the intertube hopping the temperature should be not higher that few tenth of kelvin .",
    "our theory is based on the analysis of the non - interacting electron system and does not explain the appearance of the experimentally observed low - temperature zero bias anomaly in mwnt @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that such dip in the tunnelling conductance can be attributed to the effects of electron - electron interaction either in diffusion channel ( altshuler - aronov - lee effect ) @xcite or in cooper channel ( superconducting fluctuations ) @xcite . in the first scenario",
    "the width of the dip on the voltage scale turns out to be of the order of @xmath197(@xmath162 is elastic scattering time ) , while in the second one it is of the order of @xmath198 for the case when zero - bias anomaly is large in magnitude , the nonperturbative approaches have to be applied @xcite . anyway",
    ", experimental data should reflect both free- and interacting electron effects in tunnel resistance .",
    "this would lead to a complicated dependence on voltage as it was really observed in mwnt .",
    "another important aspect of direct probing of intrinsic electronic properties of carbon nanotubes concerns the experimental problem of making low - resistance contacts to the nanotube . indeed ,",
    "if the resistance of the contact between a nanotube and metallic electrode is much higher than the resistance of the nanotube itself , the low - temperature data would refer to the properties of the metal - nanotube contact , rather than to intrinsic properties of the nanotube @xcite .",
