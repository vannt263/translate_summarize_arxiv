    "this paper analyzes linear equations containing additive and multiplicative noise .",
    "there are many problems in physics which are in this category .",
    "the two types of noise are generally uncorrelated with each other .",
    "one example is a polymer in a turbulent flow .",
    "analysis of this system yields an equation for bending modes of the polymer with two types of noise  @xcite .",
    "thermal noise presents itself in an additive way , while the effects of the random velocity field come in multiplying the coordinates of the polymer , and is hence termed multiplicative . the random flow field , being turbulent , has correlations with long decay times , and are therefore highly colored .",
    "other examples include motion of a passive scalar in a random velocity field  @xcite , and propagation of light in random media  @xcite .",
    "noise in dye lasers is modeled by multiplicative random equations  @xcite .",
    "most of the applications involve more than one degree of freedom , however the multi - dimensional case is surprisingly similar to the one component case , so it is worth studying it first .",
    "the multi - component case is considered in a separate publication  @xcite .    because of its physical applications",
    ", it seems worthwhile to attempt to understand general properties of such equations .",
    "drummond  @xcite recently analyzed such a linear one component equation of the type of interest in this paper .",
    "he considered the case where both the additive and multiplicative noise where generated by the same random process .",
    "he found two types of behavior are possible .",
    "in one regime he found that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) had power law tails , so that high enough moments of the variable of interest did not exist .",
    "the other regime had all its moments defined .",
    "in the applications mentioned above , the additive and the multiplicative noise are not correlated with each other which is unlike the cases considered by drummond  @xcite .",
    "fortunately this problem is also tractable analytically and is the subject of this paper . in this case",
    "one can go considerably further in classifying the type of behavior possible , and intuitively how it occurs .",
    "there is a large mathematical literature on the stability of the nth moment of a variable in the absence of additive noise which has been studied by the introduction of lyapunov functions  @xcite .",
    "the stability of moments can be determined if such a function can be found .",
    "the method can be extended to additive noise but does not provide a classification of the kinds of behavior expected for the tails of the distribution .",
    "the classification instead hinges on an important conceptual framework , the lyapunov _ exponents _ for these systems without additive noise , as discussed in section [ sec : absence ] .",
    "all the behavior found here is easily understood in this framework . in this case",
    "the pdf does not tend to a time independent limit , however the general scaling form of the distribution has been previously obtained  @xcite and allows one to define a set of lyapunov exponents @xmath0 .",
    "these are not related simply to lyapunov functions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 s can then be used to give a more intuitive derivation of the form of the probability distribution s tail in the presence of additive noise discussed in the sections that follow .",
    "the classification into different two regimes is now briefly described . in one regime , it is possible to show that the probability distribution of fields satisfying these types of equations have",
    "_ power law tails_. this class of problems occur under a wide variety of conditions .",
    "this will be seen first in section [ sec : heuristic ] where a heuristic argument is given to understand when such tails are present and when they should be absent .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : gaussian ] , the one dimensional version of this problem with gaussian noise is analyzed . in general these power law tails will be present with gaussian noise , even if it is not short range in time . in this case",
    "it is possible to find the exact exponent for the asymptotic probability distribution , for arbitrary time correlations in the multiplicative noise .",
    "the exponent depends continuously on the strength of the multiplicative noise in a simple way , only through the power spectrum at zero frequency .",
    "the other type of behavior is where all moments are defined and the pdf has a tail falling faster than any power law .",
    "this is shown in section [ sec : nongaussian ] to occur for one dimensional models but requires that the multiplicative noise _ not be gaussian_. in this case the pdf will be of the form of an exponential to a power law , the precise exponent depending on the lyapunov exponents for high moments .",
    "this can result in a stretched exponential distribution .",
    "here we will consider the equation @xmath1 this can be interpreted as the equation for a massless particle with friction coefficient @xmath2 connected to a spring that has a spring coefficient that varies randomly in time as @xmath3 .",
    "the spring is perturbed by a random force @xmath4 representing a heat bath at temperature t. as a result the @xmath5 is gaussian and @xmath6 function correlated @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 in general can be considered non - gaussian with a correlation function @xmath9 writing @xmath10 , this can be rewritten as @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "here we will consider eqn .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicative ] ) when the additive noise term @xmath14 is zero . in this case",
    "there is not a well defined steady state probability distribution .",
    "however it is useful to understand the time dependent form of the distribution for long times .",
    "we shall see that in this limit it has a scaling form .",
    "the main results found in this section will survive the leap to many components and provide an important conceptual framework for understanding these systems .",
    "first we review why it is that the behavior of the system is characterized by lyapunov exponents  @xcite @xmath15 where the brackets denote an ensemble average over the noise @xmath16 . to understand this , it is simplest to dispense with the linear term @xmath17 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicative ] ) at the expense of giving @xmath18 a nonzero mean @xmath19 . a straightforward way of defining a short range non - gaussian process is to discretize the above eqn . (",
    "[ eq : multiplicative ] ) , @xmath20 and using it^ o discretization , this equation with @xmath21 reads @xmath22 this defines a multiplicative process .",
    "if the different @xmath23 s are all taken to be independent the lyapunov exponents can be determined by calculating @xmath24 hence the lyapunov exponents are @xmath25 . in general",
    "these are not quadratic and depend on the probability distribution of the @xmath26 s .",
    "@xmath0 should be convex .",
    "these multiplicative random processes have been well studied , particularly in recent years in connection with `` multifractals '' .",
    "given the moments of @xmath27 it is possible to calculate its pdf for long times by performing a steepest descent analysis identical the case of multifractals  @xcite .",
    "it can be checked that the distribution giving such scaling is @xmath28 where @xmath29    from this @xmath30 can be calculated and is proportional to @xmath31 for large @xmath31 , so the the distribution continues to broaden .",
    "therefore @xmath32 does not tend towards a time independent , that is steady state , distribution .",
    "do these results persist when there are correlations between the different @xmath26 ?",
    "the answer is that if the correlations are not too long range , these results are still valid .",
    "this can be seen by making an analogy with a statistical mechanical model .",
    "denote the random variable @xmath33 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : discrete ] ) by @xmath34 .",
    "then given the joint pdf of the variables @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 can be expressed as @xmath38 this expression can be thought of as the partition function of a system with @xmath39 degrees of freedom . for large @xmath39",
    "the free energy of this is extensive if @xmath40 is sufficiently short range  @xcite .",
    "this means that for large @xmath39 @xmath41 where @xmath0 can be interpreted as the free energy per degree of freedom .",
    "before launching into a detailed mathematical analysis of this problem , it is worthwhile giving a heuristic explanation for the existence of power - law tails and their relationship to the lyapunov exponents @xmath0 .    in the absence of additive noise",
    ", we just saw that eqn .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicative ] ) can be characterized by the different moments of @xmath42 .",
    "if we examine the qth moment @xmath43 , it will either exponentially increase or decrease depending on whether @xmath0 is positive or negative respectively .",
    "now examine how the last statement changes in the presence of additive noise .",
    "when @xmath0 is positive one expects that additive noise will only increase @xmath43 further .",
    "when @xmath0 is negative @xmath43 can not be expected to go to zero as even in the absence of any multiplicative force @xmath43 should reach a non - zero steady state value .",
    "therefore we expect that in the limit @xmath44 @xmath43 has a nonzero steady state value when @xmath0 is negative , and becomes ill defined when @xmath0 is positive .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : l(q ) ] . here two examples of possible @xmath0 s are illustrated . an important restriction to bear in mind",
    "is that @xmath0 is a convex function of @xmath45 .",
    "the solid curve represents the case where @xmath0 changes sign as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 represents the point where @xmath47 . from the above argument ,",
    "for @xmath48 the moment @xmath43 becomes ill defined in steady state .",
    "below this point the moments are well defined .",
    "such behavior implies that the pdf of @xmath27 has a power - law tail @xmath49 .",
    "the other case of interest is where @xmath0 never crosses through zero for positive @xmath45 . in this case",
    "all moments are defined and @xmath50 should have a tail that vanishes more quickly then any power . in this case , it does not seem possible to obtain the actual form for the tail of @xmath50 by the heuristic considerations just presented .",
    "however in section [ sec : nongaussian ] a model will be analyzed where the form of the tail can be completely determined by a knowledge of @xmath0 for large @xmath45 .    the probability distribution with no additive noise , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : plnphi ] ) can be obtained from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : falpha ] ) with a knowledge of @xmath0 . with the convex",
    "monotonically decreasing @xmath0 just considered , it can be seen from these equations that @xmath51 is only defined up to a finite maximum value @xmath52 .",
    "after this point , the probability distribution is zero .",
    "this means that @xmath0 s of this type derive from highly non - gaussian multiplicative noise @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : discrete ] ) ) .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath26 must be zero beyond a certain value for this kind of curve , @xmath0 .",
    "we will now solve for the averaged moments of @xmath53 . since the noise is stationary , if a convergent moment exists then @xmath54 .",
    "solving eqn .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicative ] ) for @xmath55 gives @xmath56 the equation for the 2nth moment averaged over both @xmath23 and @xmath57 is @xmath58 now we take @xmath57 to be to be gaussian white noise so that wick s theorem can be applied to the right hand side to separate out the average into all possible combinations of two point correlation functions .",
    "each term gives the same contribution so one obtains @xmath59 now the limits of integration can be restricted to @xmath60 at the expense of multiplying by @xmath61 , as each possible ordering of the @xmath62 s gives an equal contribution .",
    "the average with respect to @xmath23 of the exponential can also be performed .",
    "this gives @xmath63 here we use the heaviside function @xmath64 to write @xmath65 this has the form of a staircase .",
    "before we proceed to analyze the case of general correlations in @xmath23 , we examine the case where @xmath66 a differential equation for the time evolution of the probability , @xmath67 can be derived and has the form of a generalized fokker - planck equation  @xcite . @xmath68 p\\ ] ] the steady state solution corresponding to zero particle current , that is , no particles being created or destroyed at the boundaries , is found by setting the expression to the right of the @xmath69 equal to 0 .",
    "solving this gives @xmath70 a related three dimensional version of this has been derived in the context of polymers in turbulent flow  @xcite .",
    "it shows that the large @xmath27 behavior of @xmath50 has a power law tail @xmath71 .",
    "we can check that eqn .",
    "( [ eq : general ] ) is correct by substituting eqn .",
    "( [ eq : shortrange ] ) . into it .",
    "one can then decouple all of the @xmath62 integrations by making the change of variables @xmath72 so the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : general ] ) becomes @xmath73 performing the intergration gives @xmath74 this can be compared with the answer obtained from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : p(x ) ] ) by computing moments .",
    "the integrals can be done in closed form  @xcite and give the identical result .",
    "clearly the precise form of the moments @xmath75 , and hence @xmath50 , is dependent on the whole function @xmath76 .",
    "however we shall now see that the large @xmath27 behavior of @xmath50 only depends on the total area under @xmath76 .      to determine the power law exponent of @xmath50 for large @xmath27 , for general correlations @xmath76 , one locates at which value of @xmath39 eqn.([eq : general ] ) becomes divergent .",
    "that is if we define @xmath77 so that @xmath78 for large @xmath27 , then @xmath75 becomes divergent when @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "for example for short range correlations , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : shortmoment ] ) , becomes divergent when @xmath81 .",
    "therefore @xmath82 , in agreement with eqn . (",
    "[ eq : p(x ) ] ) . therefore the object of this section is to locate the value of @xmath39 where eqn .",
    "( [ eq : general ] ) becomes divergent , for general but normalizable @xmath76 .    to do this we rescale the @xmath62 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : general ] ) @xmath83 so that @xmath84 the divergence in @xmath75 is therefore controlled by the large @xmath85 behavior of @xmath86 . for large @xmath85",
    "the function @xmath87 becomes very sharply peaked .",
    "one can define a limit of functions approaching a @xmath6 function by @xmath88 for large @xmath85 , the leading order term in the exponent of the integrand is identical to the short range case @xmath89\\ ] ] where the exponent @xmath90 depends on the form of @xmath76 . as @xmath39 increases ,",
    "the staircase function @xmath91 becomes larger . since the second term is quadratic , and the first term , linear in @xmath92 , for large enough @xmath39 ithe expression inside the square brackets becomes positive so that the entire expression will increase linear with s , for some values of the @xmath93 s",
    "this leads to a divergence .",
    "lower order corrections in @xmath85 , can not change this point of divergence as it is determined by the sign of the slope of this expression for large s.    therefore for large @xmath85 , @xmath86 will only depend on @xmath94 , the total area under @xmath76 .",
    "we now relax the restriction that the multiplicative noise be gaussian , but restrict the analysis to the case of short range correlations . in section",
    "[ sec : absence ] eqn.([eq : multiplicative ] ) was discretized . with additive noise included it can also be solved in discretized form , but the results are very similar looking to the continuous case .",
    "we can , with little loss of generality use the continuous form of the equation to analyze this problem . with continuous notation the equation for the lyapunov exponents",
    "read @xmath95 defining @xmath96 we can still salvage the previous calculation up to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : wick ] ) , with @xmath97 , and have @xmath98 using the change of variables of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : change ] ) and also eqn .",
    "( [ eq : l(q ) ] ) defining the lyapunov exponents , this yields @xmath99 performing the integrations over the @xmath100 s gives the final answer @xmath101 the above analysis has assumed that the discretization time step @xmath102 is very small so that @xmath103 is small .",
    "similar expressions to above can be derived for the discretized case without this restriction on @xmath102 which amounts to replacing the last integration over the @xmath104 s by a discrete summation .",
    "this gives @xmath105      by knowing the moments of @xmath27 one can obtain its pdf .",
    "now that we have an expression for the moments eqn .",
