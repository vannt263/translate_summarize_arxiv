    "the relevant order parameters are the mean expectation values of the magnetization along the parallel and orthogonal directions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "typically , we also consider the local magnetization @xmath22 and @xmath23 , indicating which regions of the chain are being discussed .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 vanish as the amplitude of the external fields approaches zero . for large field intensity",
    ", @xmath24 follows the local direction of the field . in this case",
    ", the average @xmath25 is essentially zero .",
    "entanglement is known to be a good predictor of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "although there is a variety of possibilities , the observation of a singularity in an entanglement measure most certainly implies a second order quantum phase transition . in order to measure entanglement",
    "we will use the block entropy @xmath26 , defined as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of @xmath27 spins of the chain . by means of a schmidt decomposition",

    "the positive numbers @xmath33 are the so called schmidt coefficients , and give the block entropy @xmath34 the value of @xmath26 depends on both classical and quantum correlations ( such as entanglement ) between the two blocks @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] of the @xmath9-spin chain .",
    "the so called area law says that the block entropy of a ground state generally scales with the size of the boundary ( area ) of the system @xcite  except at criticality , where there are typically logarithmic corrections .",
    "in one dimensional systems , the boundary of a block is constant .",
    "thus , away from the critical point , entropy saturates beyond a certain block size @xmath37 : @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "let us analyze the behavior of the block entropy of our system for some limit cases .",
    "for small fields , the @xmath0 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) dominates , and the system exhibits long range entanglement .",
    "this leads to a large number of non - zero schmidt coefficients and therefore large block entropy .",
    "in contrast , for large amplitudes of the field , the second sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) dominates the behavior of the system : the ground state is a product state with only one non - zero schmidt coefficient ( that must be equal to one because of normalization ) , which gives @xmath40 .",
    "to obtain the ground state of finite chains for arbitrary configurations of disorder we employ the time evolving block decimation algorithm with an imaginary time evolution @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on calculating schmidt decompositions at all links of the spin chain , which leads to describing the quantum state through a product of matrices .",
    "the rank of these matrices reflects the number of schmidt coefficients that are retained for the simulations .",
    "therefore , slightly entangled systems ( in terms of the number of non - vanishing schmidt coefficients ) are described accurately by small matrices , which leads to a large computational speedup .",
    "strongly entangled systems , in contrast , require very large matrices to be described accurately .",
    "excessive truncation of the matrices induces a breakdown of the algorithm , although in general one can monitor the accuracy before this happens  for example , by measuring the value of the smallest retained schmidt coefficients .",
    "we also perform additional tests to ensure that the numerical solution does not depend on the maximum number of schmidt coefficients .",
    "the tebd algorithm used for our simulations is particularly efficient for one - dimensional systems with on - site and nearest - neighbors interactions only , as is the case for the @xmath0 system in presence of the external random field .",
    "we implemented the algorithm for finite systems with open boundary conditions , and for infinite systems with a periodic hamiltonian by imposing the periodicity of the solution . due to the numerical complexity of the algorithms",
    ", we used a wide range of resources from desktop computers and local clusters to the zaragoza supercomputer with up to 50 parallel processors .",
    "the disorder - induced order effect is symmetric with respect to the orthogonal direction of the disordered field . because of this , the original proposal used convenient boundary conditions in order to lift this symmetry @xcite . for our simulations ,",
    "usually it turned out to be enough to impose non - symmetric initial conditions for computing the imaginary time evolution towards the ground - state .",
    "we begin by reviewing the case of an staggered magnetic field , @xmath41 .",
    "although it is not random , its non - uniformity will help us gain a good intuition for the random case .",
    "we observe two distinct regimes as a function of the magnetic field intensity @xmath42 ( see fig .",

    "a finite spontaneous magnetization arises in the direction orthogonal to the field . on the other extreme , for large @xmath42",
    ", the magnetization in this direction is zero .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the transition between the two regimes is sharp , indicating the presence of a second order quantum phase transition .",
    "our numerical estimate of the critical point is @xmath43 , which is in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "as the field intensity approaches @xmath44 from below , the spontaneous magnetization decays according to a power law , @xmath45 .",
    "our numerical analysis gives @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ one]b , we see evidence that at the critical field intensity of the staggered magnetization along the direction of the field does , indeed , show a singularity in the first derivative .    in fig .",
    "[ one]c we show the block entropy @xmath47 for a semi - infinite block as a function of intensity of the staggered field .",
    "near the critical point , the entropy of a semi - infinite block diverges as @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory .",
    "the factor @xmath50 in ( [ entropy_infinite_block ] ) appears because we measure entropy between two semi - infinite parts of the chain with only one boundary between them . through a best fit to the data shown in fig .",
    "[ one]d , we obtain a value of @xmath51 for the central charge .    for small values of the field ,",
    "the entropy diverges as we approach the isotropic @xmath0 critical point . for larger values of the field intensity",
    ", entropy decays to zero , which is expected as the ground state becomes a product state . as a curiosity , for field intensities smaller than the critical , there is a special value @xmath52 of the field for which the block entropy is exactly zero , and the ground state is thus a nel product state @xcite .     for a semi - infinite block .",

    "the system exhibits spontaneous perpendicular magnetization for small , non - zero values of @xmath56 , whereas for large intensities @xmath56 the parallel magnetization follows the oscillating field .",
    "figure  [ omag_osc ] shows the orthogonal magnetization of the individual spins for different amplitudes of the external oscillating field .",
    "similar to the staggered field ( fig  [ one]b ) , we observe two regimes of orthogonal magnetization : presence of orthogonal magnetization for small amplitudes up to a given value depending on @xmath57 , and disappearance thereof for larger amplitudes .",
    "the sinusoidal nature of the uni - axial external magnetic field is translated to a slight variation in the strength of the orthogonal magnetization .",
    ", for example , we see the appearance of a regime with orthogonal magnetization for disorder amplitudes of around 1.0 and disappearance of orthogonal magnetization around disorder amplitude of about 1.5 .",
    "this confirms that uni - axially oscillating magnetic fields can induce magnetization orthogonal to the oscillating direction.,title=\"fig:\",width=325 ] -0.4 cm    in fig .",
    "[ cmag_osc ] , we see that the magnetization of the spins is dominated by external field when the latter has large amplitudes , confirming physical intuition .",

    "cm    we show the block entropy as a function of the site and disorder amplitude in fig .",
    "[ cent_osc ] .",
    "as expected , at very low fields  near the isotropic @xmath0 critical point  the entropy grows slowly with system size , while it stabilizes rapidly for larger @xmath56 .",

    ", we see that spontaneous symmetry breaking appears near the zeros of @xmath58 . for strong enough intensities",
    "@xmath56 , this leads to the creation of a set of `` islands '' of perpendicularly magnetized spins in a sea of transverse magnetization . when @xmath56 is weak enough , however , the island size @xmath59 becomes greater than the distance between the islands @xmath60 , the isolated islands merge , and there is non - zero @xmath25 of definite sign everywhere ( fig .",
    "[ sinfmx]c ) . the periodic transition from one phase to the other",
    "can be understood in terms of quantum phase transitions in space @xcite : away from the critical points , the system follows the local value of the field adiabatically ( fig .",
    "[ sinfmx]b ) and remains on the corresponding phase . in our system",
    ", this corresponds to the regions where the field is very large and therefore the local magnetization is in the symmetric phase @xmath61 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , when the amplitude of the field @xmath58 approaches its critical value , the local correlation length of the system , @xmath62 , can become much larger than the rate of change of the field , @xmath63 . in this regime",
    "the system can not heal fast enough ( compared to the change in the field ) , and it begins to transition from one phase to the other , forming an island of broken symmetry with a random sign of @xmath25 .",
    "we can estimate the size @xmath59 of an island by linearizing the magnetic field near its zero at @xmath64 : @xmath65 . at the boundary of the island we have the condition @xmath66 , which writes as @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the size of an isolated island of perpendicular magnetization results r ( h k)^- .",
    "[ deltai ] this line of reasoning , based on the kibble - urek mechanism , allows us to also estimate how the amplitude of perpendicular magnetization in the islands depends on @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in a first approximation ,",
    "the total magnetization is constant during the transition in space ( fig .",
    "[ sinfmx]d ) .",
    "when the local density approximation starts to break , i.e. at @xmath68 , the system goes from an adiabatic to an impulse region , and the order parameter at this point must `` freeze '' .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the amplitude of perpendicular magnetization in the island with the value of the parallel magnetization at the freezing point , @xmath69 . using that near the critical point @xmath70 @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath71    we simulated an infinite system with @xmath72 and n=512 .",

    "the results , shown in fig .",

    "we study randomly oscillating fields produced from a normal distribution of mean zero and varying standard deviation .",
    "a large standard deviation is equivalent to a large amplitude of an oscillating field .",
    "producing pseudo - random numbers following a normal distribution is similar to the possible experimental realization of a disordered field using laser speckles ( which has already been demonstrated ) .",
    "figure  [ omag_ds ] shows the formation of islands of magnetization , coinciding with positive , negative , or alternating regions of the parallel magnetization .",
    "since the external random field oscillates rapidly , the parallel magnetization , shown fig .",

    "[ cent_ds ] shows a maximum of the block entropy at the disorder amplitude corresponding to the disappearance of the orthogonal magnetization .",
    "in fact , the bulk of the material no longer shows a monotone decrease of the block entropy for increasing amplitudes up to the disappearance of the orthogonal magnetization .",
    "there now appears a more complex structure dumping into a marked minimum right before the maximum at which the amplitude of the orthogonal magnetization vanishes .",
    "the contrast between these two final extremal points resembles the discontinuity observed in the staggered field and appears to support the claim of a phase - transition at the corresponding disorder amplitudes .",
    "-0.4 cm    the fact that even for uncorrelated magnetic fields there appears to be ( in most cases ) , a region of orthogonal magnetization illustrates the robustness of the effect .",
    "our studies show that the disorder amplitude for which the orthogonal magnetization disappears now strongly depends on the individual uni - axial random field configuration .",
    "figure  [ avg_orthmag_ds ] shows the mean value over 10 disordered realizations of the perpendicular magnetization .",
    "the graph shows a clear average presence of orthogonal magnetization for small amplitudes .",
    "the mean orthogonal magnetization appears to be strongest for a disorder amplitude of approximately @xmath80 of the @xmath0 spin - spin correlation .",
    "as expected , the randomly oscillating field presents a number of islands of different sizes because there are regions of predominantly positive , negative or oscillating random values .",
    "when averaging over several realizations , we still see a clear overall induced constant order for small amplitudes of the external magnetic uni - axial random field .",
    "the proposal below combines raman coupling to realize the spin dependent lattice with radio - frequency transitions to induce the desired structure of the hopping matrices .",
    "the main idea stems from l.  mazza _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and consists of creating a lattice that traps certain bosonic alkali atoms in all states from the lower hyperfine manifold , and atoms in a certain state of the upper hyperfine manifold in between the sites of the square lattice ( the original goal of this approach was to design non - abelian gauge fields in 3d lattice , details will be published elsewhere ) .",
    "the main ingredient is to use the _ magic wavelength _",
    ", experimentally realized in systems with @xmath81rb .",
    "this is in principle feasible with all the alkaline atoms , since they share the same fine structure .",
    "we propose to use the wavelength @xmath82 such that the contribution for trapping the state @xmath83 coming from the states @xmath84 and @xmath85 exactly cancel . in this way , the state @xmath86 feels the potential coming from the @xmath87 polarized light whereas the state @xmath88 that coming from the @xmath89 polarized light ( the quantization axis of @xmath90 coincides with the propagation direction of the circularly polarized light )",
    ". one should avoid working with light atoms such as @xmath91li due to the small fine splitting .",
    "we can , however , take heavier atoms ( like @xmath92k , @xmath93k or even better @xmath94rb or @xmath81rb ) and eventually pump the atoms to the extremal zeeman levels , that will then serve as spinless atoms .",
    "this approach will limit the lifetime to be @xmath95s , but should suffice to observe at least some of the physics of dio . for experimental realizations along these lines ,",
    "see for example  @xcite .",
    "we start by confining the atoms in 1d , say along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "we take two laser pulses propagating in the @xmath6 direction with circularly polarized light with respect to the @xmath6 direction . denoting by @xmath96 the nuclear spin , the general result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that for appropriately designed laser fields all @xmath97 states are trapped in the 1d lattice sites , with @xmath6 now the natural quantization axis .",
    "the optical potential for the @xmath98 manifold has minima in the same lattice sites , but , interestingly , develops also minima for the states @xmath99 in the middle of the links in the @xmath6 directions .",
    "these states , on the one hand , have good overlaps with the @xmath97 states in the basic 1d lattice sites , and obviously can serve as intermediate states for the radio - frequency transitions between the @xmath97 atoms . on the other hand , the trapping potential for the states in the @xmath98 manifold can be quite weak , so that tunneling effectively dominates over interactions .",
    "the trapping potential for @xmath97 atoms can be strong enough to put them in the mott insulating regime .    in the case of rubidium @xmath100 , one should prepare a large condensate in the @xmath101 manifold , and then pump some atoms to the @xmath102 states . in the strong repulsion regime ( hard bosons regime ) , the hamiltonian for @xmath103 atoms reduces to that of the @xmath0 model . the uni - axial random field in the @xmath0 plane",
    "can be easily realized using raman ( optical or rf ) transitions with fixed phases and random strengths , as in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same scheme can be generalized to 2d in a square , and even 3d in a simple cubic lattice . in 2d for instance , we start by confining the atoms in 2d , say in the @xmath0plane .",
    "we take two laser pulses propagating in the @xmath6 direction with circularly polarized light with respect to the @xmath6 direction .",
    "similarly , we apply two laser pulses in the @xmath7 direction with the circular polarizations corresponding to propagation axis @xmath7 . again",
    ", the general result is that for appropriately designed laser fields all @xmath97 states are trapped in the square lattice sites .",
    "the natural quantization axis for them is now a 45 degrees axis between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the optical potential for the @xmath98 manifold has minima in the same lattice sites , but , interestingly , develops also minima for the states @xmath99 and @xmath104 in the middle of the links in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions , respectively .",
    "these states have good overlaps with the @xmath97 states in the basic square lattice sites , and obviously can serve as intermediate states for the radio - frequency transitions between the @xmath97 atoms .",
    "the remaining ingredient of the proposal are the same as in 1d .",
    "after the effect of disorder - induced order has been shown in classical systems , we have presented numerical evidence that this effect also exists in quantum systems such as quantum @xmath0 chains .",
    "the effect consists in the appearance of magnetization in the direction orthogonal to a spatially disordered external magnetic field for small amplitudes of this field .",
    "the key ingredients for justifying this result are values of various components of magnetization ( which are directly measurable in the experimental scheme discussed above ) , and non - monotone block entropy .",
    "the latter can not be measured directly , but its properties can be inferred from the measurements of density - density correlations using bragg spectroscopy , noise interferometry , and/or spin polarization spectroscopy .",
    "finally , let us mention that recently an analogue of dio in the time domain ( i.e. with time dependent perturbations ) has been proposed and termed _ rocking _",

    "<S> this phenomenon depends crucially on two ingredients : the unperturbed system must have a continuous symmetry , and the disorder must break it  for instance by promoting a single direction in space . let us explain this through an example . consider a chain of spins with isotropic nearest neighbor interaction in the @xmath0 plane , which has a @xmath4 rotational symmetry about the @xmath5 axis . </S>",

    "<S> if a disorder distribution has the same symmetry as the system , the disorder suppresses the spontaneous magnetization even more : even arbitrarily small disorder of this form destroys the order at @xmath1 in 2d , and it presumably lowers the critical temperature of the transition in 3d @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the mechanism of dio is quite general  it can be applied whenever there is a continuous symmetry in the system that can be broken with a random field with a lesser symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have recently showed that a disordered random field with a symmetry different than that of the system may increase order in the direction where there is no disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we considered a two - dimensional array of classical spins with a ferromagnetic interaction in presence of a random external magnetic field in the @xmath7 direction . with this choice of disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the system has a remaining mirror symmetry along the @xmath7 axis ( which can easily be broken by appropriate boundary conditions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that , in this case , the disorder will always induce a non - zero magnetization in the @xmath6 axis  </S>",
    "<S> i.e. in the direction orthogonal to the random field . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the relative phase of two - component interacting bose - einstein condensates can be fixed by applying a suitable random coupling raman field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same can be done with the relative phase between the superfluid order parameter of an ultra - cold fermi gas and the wave function of a molecular bec of the same species @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the disorder is provided by a spatially random photo - associative - dissociative coupling between the bec and the fermi gas atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we report numerical studies of one - dimensional quantum spin chains that present disorder - induced order . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider isotropic @xmath0 spin chains subject to a random magnetic field along one axis on the @xmath0 plane . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidence of the formation of spontaneous magnetization , and a transition from that phase to a phase without long - range order for a critical strength of the disordered field . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the magnetization , we study the behavior of entanglement . using numerical methods , we are able to identify the quantum critical point for a particular case of staggered magnetic field and the critical exponents in that situation . </S>",
    "<S> the transition that we discuss here is an analogue of the one that can be obtained with staggered magnetic fields in the gapless phases of the @xmath8 model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that we mostly consider magnetic fields that oscillate on a much larger spatial scale , or are fully random .    </S>",
    "<S> we envision an implementation of our ideas using ultra - cold atom experiments . </S>",
    "<S> technological developments have made ultra - cold gases a powerful tool to study condensed matter systems with an unprecedented degree of control  allowing the manipulation of geometry , dimensionality , and even the interaction strength between particles ( by means of feshbach resonances )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the power of ultra - cold atom systems as a test bed for condensed matter physics was the recent observation of matter - wave anderson localization @xcite  predicted already in 1958 in the context of the metal - insulator transition @xcite , and for ultra - cold atoms in 2003 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments , and others , illustrated an interesting difference between cold gases and usual condensed matter systems : because the potentials are exceedingly clean , and thermal fluctuations negligible , disorder in cold atom experiments does not occur naturally and has to be introduced _ </S>",
    "<S> by design_. this , in turn , translates into complete control over the disorder distribution : e.g. by changing light intensity the disorder strength can be varied continuously . </S>",
    "<S> typically one can use laser speckles to induce static unstructured randomness ( pioneered by the late g. grynberg @xcite ) , or superposed lasers of incommensurate wavelengths to create quasi - randomness ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can control nonlinear interaction strengths using feschbach resonances , and reach in this way various regimes @xcite of the anderson - bose glass phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this manipulability is essential for deep exploration of disorder - induced order phenomena , and for observation of the phenomena discussed in this paper . </S>"
