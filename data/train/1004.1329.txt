    "basically , our approach is based on the fact that for increasing values of the igmf the level of expected reprocessed emission in the mev - gev band decreases , since the total amount of the primary flux is spread over larger solid angles .",

    "as long as the intrinsic spectrum is hard , the amount of absorbed energy depends only on the intrinsic luminosity of the highest energy bin @xmath22 . the most conservative limit on the igmf corresponds to the lowest amount of reprocessed radiation that in turn corresponds to the smallest intrinsic luminosity . to this aim",

    "the lower limit on the value of the magnetic field derived here , @xmath78 g can be considered one of the most stringent value ever derived for the igmf . the value is mainly constrained by the lat upper limit above 10 gev , in which the source is tentatively detected at the 4@xmath79 level .",

    "any variations of the intrinsic emission of the blazars , will be reflected into the reprocessed emission .",
    "ideally , simultaneous tev and gev observations would be required to take into account variability and exploit the information carried by the delay between the intrinsic tev and the reprocessed gev emission ( see dai et al . 2002 , murase et al .",
    "2008 for discussions ) .",
    "however , this approach is prevented in the specific case of 1es 0229 + 200 by the very small gev flux , still at the detection limit of lat after 18 months of observations .",
    "also in other tev bl lacs more bright in the tev band , integration over few days are necessary to detect the gev emission ( e.g. abdo et al .",
    "moreover , in these objects , the intrinsic gev emission is much more luminous than the expected reprocessed radiation .",
    "these features make difficult to reveal the reprocessed radiation even during bright flares .",
    "the use of a specific model for the absorption is unavoidable .",
    "however , several of recent ebl models converge at the wavelengths above 10 @xmath80 m , the ones determining the opacity for @xmath7rays of energy below 10 tev . in particular , the recent models of franceschini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , gilmore et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , finke et al .",
    "( 2010 ) agree well ( see e.g. the discussion of finke et al . 2010 ) and are consistent with the low level of the ebl suggested by recent observations of cherenkov telescopes ( e.g. aharonian et al .",

    "the model adopted here ( _ lowsfr _ of kneiske et al .",
    "2004 ) provides an optical depth similar to that of all the other updated models up to energies of 45 tev . for larger energies",
    "the predicted optical depth is _ lower _ than that of the other models ( see also tavecchio et al .",
    "we again stress that this implies to minimize the luminosity of the reprocessed radiation , and hence the derived lower limit of @xmath2 is a conservative value .",
    "the assumed maximum energy of the intrinsic emission , point ( iii ) , is somewhat critical , since it determines the total amount of energy reprocessed and then re - emitted in the gev band , and the possible development of cascades .",
    "the first point is clear : since the intrinsic spectrum is rather hard , the total luminosity of reprocessed radiation ( and its maximum energy ) depends on @xmath22 . under the assumption that the spectrum is proportional to @xmath81 ,",
    "the normalization of the reprocessed emission is ( see eq .",
    "[ finale ] ) @xmath82 . therefore all the curves reported in fig.[sed ] will shift upward by this factor .",
    "we consider unlikely that the spectrum extends unbroken at energies well above few tens of tev and therefore the correction factor can not be much larger than a factor of a few . in any case",
    "we remark again that , since a larger @xmath22 would have the effect to _ increase _ the value of the derived lower limit ( a larger @xmath2 would be required to downshift the curves ) , our limit can be considered also in this respect , again , as a conservative value .",
    "the same argument applies when considering the possible role of electromagnetic cascades . for values of @xmath22",
    "larger than @xmath83 tev a sizeable amount of the reprocessed flux would be emitted above @xmath84 gev ( the energy above which the optical depth for pair conversion exceeds 1 ) and then reabsorbed , in turn producing new pairs and thus initiating a cascade .",
    "in this case , apart the different resulting spectrum , the total flux of the reprocessed component would be larger than what simply estimated here : therefore , also in this case , our value of @xmath2 can considered a conservative value .",
    "finally , we note that in our derivation we are implicitly assuming that the magnetic field is oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the relativistic pairs . in reality",
    "the igmf is probably randomly oriented , maintaining its coherence in domains with a size @xmath851 mpc ( e.g. neronov & semikoz 2009 ) . including the geometry of the field in our calculations would result in a limit to the igmf slightly larger than that derived here .",
    "again , our inferred value of @xmath2 is then a conservative one .",
