    "a tremendous amount of experimental data on @xmath7 meson decays are being collected from @xmath7 factory experiments , such as belle and babar .",
    "experimentally plenty of two - body hadronic @xmath7 decays have been observed and a lot of theoretical works on these decay processes have been done . in particular , the first observation of the color - suppressed decay processes @xmath8 and @xmath9 by the belle collaboration @xcite has drawn special attentions , since it allows one to do a complete isospin analysis of the @xmath10 modes together with the previously observed charged modes of the @xmath10 type .",
    "two - body hadronic @xmath7 meson decays to @xmath11 and @xmath12 final states have been of great interest . in these decay modes",
    ", there is no contribution from penguin diagrams so that theoretical uncertainties involved in the relevant qcd dynamics become much less .",
    "thus , these modes serve as a good testing ground for various theoretical issues in hadronic @xmath7 decays , such as factorization hypothesis and final - state interactions .",
    "these processes are also expected to be useful for a determination of the cp violating phases , e.g. , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it has been expected that in a heavy quark limit , certain two - body charmed @xmath7 decays , such as @xmath14 [ referred to as the class-1 ( color - allowed ) topology ] , can be explained well with the factorization hypothesis implying small final - state interactions .",
    "it has been confirmed in the qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent work based on the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite , it was pointed out that in order to explain @xmath15 [ referred to as the class-2 ( color - suppressed ) topology ] as well as @xmath16 [ referred to as the class-3 ( involving both color - allowed and color - suppressed ) topology ] , there must exist a sizable relative strong phase @xmath17 between the class-1 and the class-2 amplitudes : e.g. , @xmath18 .",
    "this relative strong phase arises from qcd dynamics through short - distance strong interactions and differs from the final - state strong phases through long - distance rescattering interactions .",
    "motivated by experimental measurements of the branching ratios ( brs ) for @xmath19 and @xmath20 decays , some phenomenological studies have been performed to determine the possible final - state rescattering strong phases in these processes @xcite .",
    "especially , in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath19 and @xmath10 modes were studied _ through the isospin analysis_. however , in those works , the possibility of a sizable relative strong phase between the color - allowed and the color - suppressed tree amplitudes was completely ignored . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath21 and @xmath10 modes were analyzed _ in the topological quark diagram approach _ and in that analysis _",
    "flavor su(3 ) symmetry _ was assumed to combine the relevant amplitudes with each other .    in this work",
    ", we re - analyze the @xmath0 and @xmath19 modes as well as @xmath6 and @xmath22 in the quark diagram approach , focusing on the following interesting issues .",
    "( i ) we estimate , in a model - independent way , the magnitude of the relative strong phases , _ taking into account the possibility of a sizable relative strong phase between the color - allowed and the color - suppressed tree amplitudes_. this approach is different from that by xing @xcite , where the strong phase difference between the color - allowed and the color - suppressed tree amplitude was assumed to be zero .",
    "( ii ) we first study the @xmath23 and @xmath24 independently , without using the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , in order to avoid the possibly large effect of su(3 ) breaking .",
    "( in fact , we shall see later that the su(3 ) breaking effect can be sizable . )",
    "( iii ) to determine the most likely values of the magnitudes of the relative strong phase shifts in a statistically reliable way , we do the @xmath4 analysis ( with the flavor su(3 ) and its breaking effect together ) and explicitly show that the relative final - state strong phases in @xmath0 and @xmath25 are _ non - zero at 1@xmath5 level_. ( iv ) we examine the validity of factorization approximation in these @xmath26 type decay modes , and estimate the flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in a model - independent way .",

    "first , let us consider the decay processes @xmath20 .",
    "the decay amplitudes for two - body hadronic @xmath7 decays can be represented in terms of the basis of topological quark diagram contributions @xcite , such as @xmath30 ( color - allowed tree amplitude ) , @xmath31 ( color - suppressed tree amplitude ) , @xmath32 ( exchange amplitude ) , and so on .",
    "the relevant decay amplitudes for @xmath0 can be written as @xmath33 where the topological amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as @xmath36 with the real amplitudes @xmath37 and the strong phases @xmath38 .",
    "note that no weak phase appears in the above amplitudes due to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factor @xmath39 .    from ( [ decayandtopo ] ) ,",
    "the magnitudes @xmath40 and @xmath41 and strong phase difference @xmath42 of the topological amplitudes can be determined in a model - independent way : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the life time of @xmath45 .",

    "since the same relations ( [ decayandtopo ] ) also hold for the corresponding @xmath29 modes , the above result in ( [ topo ] ) can be used for the relevant modes @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 by simply replacing @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",

    "1 ) obtained from the @xmath4 analysis ( see sec .",
    "iv for more detailed discussion ) indicates that @xmath61 where the possibility that @xmath62 is excluded .",

    "( fig1.eps width 6 cm )    the strong phase difference is quite sizable .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the contribution from the color - suppressed tree diagram could be larger than the previously estimated one , e.g. , @xmath65 given in ref .",
    "in other works , the large color - suppressed tree contribution is favored by the present experimental data .",
    "( fig2.eps width 6 cm )    for @xmath29 modes , we present @xmath66 versus @xmath67 in fig . 2 , and show the magnitudes of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in table ii .",
    "for the central values of the data , @xmath70 as in the case of @xmath0 decays , we obtain a similar result for @xmath6 decays : the phase difference is sizable and the large color - suppressed tree contribution is favored .",
    "now let us examine the validity of the factorization approximation in @xmath20 decays . in the naive factorization approximation , the topological amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "are given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the relevant ckm matrix elements , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the effective wilson coefficients . @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the decay constant of a @xmath78 meson and the hadronic form factor for the @xmath79 transition at @xmath80 , respectively .",

    "the allowed value of the ratio @xmath111 is in between 0.31 and 0.69 .    from the above results",
    ", we see that if one assumes the naive factorization in @xmath0 and @xmath29 decays , the favored value of the ratio @xmath111 is much larger than the usual estimate @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "this can be possibly understood if the magnitude of the color - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath113 is effectively enhanced due to non - factorizable contributions as in the pqcd approach @xcite or final - state interactions @xcite .",

    "the above amplitudes involve no weak phase because of the ckm factor @xmath121 .    in the above equations ( [ dpidecayandtopo ] ) and ( [ dpitopoamp ] ) , there are five unknown parameters ( one relative phase can be removed ) , while only three brs have been measured from experiments .",
    "to determine the unknown parameters , one needs more information . for this purpose",
    ", one may invoke flavor su(3 ) symmetry to connect the amplitudes for @xmath27 to those for @xmath0 .",
    "however , as we shall see later , the su(3 ) breaking effect can be sizable .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , instead of using the su(3 ) symmetry between all the relevant amplitudes , we use the su(3 ) symmetry only for the exchange amplitude @xmath116 , because the exchange contribution is expected to be small due to a suppression factor of @xmath122 . from the measured br for @xmath123 which involves only the @xmath124-exchange diagram",

    "it indicates that for @xmath27 and @xmath28 the color - suppressed tree contributions to @xmath115 and @xmath154 are effectively enhanced .",
    "the possible mechanism for this enhancement is either the short - distance non - factorizable contribution @xcite or large final - state rescattering interactions @xcite , or both of them .",
    "in order to find the most likely values of the magnitudes of the topological amplitudes and the strong phase shifts in @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 , @xmath3 , we do the @xmath4 analysis using the brs of these decay processes .",

    "our result indicates that the exchange contribution in @xmath19 decay can be sizably enhanced as well , which is contrary to the usual estimate in the qcd factorization .",
    "notice that within the flavor su(3 ) symmetry with a reasonable su(3 ) breaking effect in the @xmath54 and @xmath2 decays , the strong phase difference between the color-_allowed _ and -_suppressed _ decay amplitudes does not vanish at the level of one standard deviation .",
    "similarly to the @xmath0 and @xmath2 case , we have the six measured brs of @xmath29 and @xmath3 and the five parameters . assuming the flavor su(3 ) symmetry [ @xmath169 , we find that @xmath170 .",

    "good fits are obtained for both cases of the su(3 ) symmetry and the broken su(3 ) symmetry .",

    "further , the parameters obtained in the case of the su(3 ) symmetry are quite similar to those obtained in the broken su(3 ) symmetry , except the parameter @xmath179 which shows a sizable difference in the two cases . the black dots in figs .",
    "3 ( for @xmath6 ) and 4 ( for @xmath28 ) show @xmath164 versus @xmath165 for @xmath140 .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath149 is also consistent with the one used in sec .",

    "this will be tested with future experimental results on the brs for these decay modes .",
    "let us estimate the flavor su(3)symmetry breaking effect in @xmath181 and @xmath24 decays .",

    "we find for @xmath0 and @xmath27 , @xmath184 and for @xmath6 and @xmath28 , @xmath185 the above result shows that the su(3 ) breaking effect can be sizable : i.e. , about @xmath186 at the amplitude level , except the color - allowed tree amplitudes for @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "our result for the color - allowed tree amplitudes in ( [ su3breaktdkdpi ] ) and ( [ su3breaktdkstardrho ] ) agrees with that of ref .",
    "but , the result for the color - suppressed tree amplitudes does not agree with the estimate in the naive factorization shown in @xcite and shows about two or three times larger breaking effect .",
    "it again indicates that the color - suppressed tree amplitudes can not be reasonably estimated by the naive factorization , because they can be effectively enhanced by non - factorizable effect and final - state interactions , as discussed before .",
    "we studied @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath27 , @xmath3 decay processes in a model - independent way . using the quark diagram decomposition of the decay amplitudes and the present experimental result on the relevant brs",
    ", we determined the magnitudes and the relative strong phase shifts of the relevant amplitudes .",

    "it should be emphasized that @xmath155 is _ non - zero _ at 1@xmath5 level ( figs . 1 and 3 ) .",
    "this result is obtained from the statistical approach and clearly different from those of the previous works , where @xmath155 was assumed to be @xmath189 @xcite , or the vanishing @xmath155 could not be excluded with the present data @xcite .",
    "another interesting result is that in @xmath23 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays , the color - suppressed tree contributions are effectively enhanced , which is inconsistent with the naive expectation in the factorization approximation .",
