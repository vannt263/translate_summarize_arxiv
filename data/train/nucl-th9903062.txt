    "the four nucleon continuum spectrum constitutes the present challenge of the few - body nuclear problem .",
    "its interest lies not only in the natural progression that it represents towards the description of an increasing complexity but also in the richness of the a=4 nuclear chart itself .",
    "the problem implies , we believe , a qualitative jump with respect to the a=3 case .",
    "indeed the failure of the usual nn interactions in describing the 3n system and the 4n bound state can be to a large extent overcome by the inclusion of three nucleon interactions ( tni ) @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach is mainly due to the strong correlation existing between the low energy scattering observables and the three nucleon binding energy @xcite , which in its turn is strongly correlated to the four nucleon one @xcite .",
    "this means that the zero and low energy three and four nucleon problem depend on a few number of parameters which can be found in any existing tni . by adjusting these parameters in order to reproduce the triton binding energy a global satisfactory description of the 3n system and the 4n bound state",
    "is reached @xcite .",
    "the strength of the tni depends on the underlying nn forces and their main effect is to rescale the 3n and 4n bound states energies .",
    "their influence on the 3n continuum manifests itself only at relatively high energies @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the 3n case , the 4n continuum spectrum exhibits a rich variety of resonances and thresholds sufficiently far from the zero energy region that can not be determined by the low energy properties . the simple comparison between the smooth behaviour observed in the n+d elastic cross section and the non trivial structure manifested in the n+t case illustrates this point well .",
    "it is therefore not clear that the approach followed until now , based on a good description of the deuteron and triton binding energies , could be successfully extended . a resonant state spreads over an energy region given by its width and fully displays there the internal dynamics of the 4n system .",
    "its theoretical description provides a severe test in our understanding of the nuclear forces .    among the different scattering channels the n+t elastic case is the",
    "simplest one and so is the obliged first step before a more ambitious program can be undertaken .",
    "on the one hand , it is is a pure t=1 channel free from the additional difficulties arising when dealing with coulomb forces . on the other hand high quality measurement of the total n+t cross sections",
    "are available @xcite .",
    "they show a resonant structure interpreted by the r - matrix analysis of hale and collaborators as being generated by a family of resonances @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate whether the usual realistic nn interactions are able to account for these experimental facts .",
    "the results we will present in what follows have been obtained by solving the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations in configuration space .",
    "the formal apparatus and details on the numerical methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "we will restrict ourselves in this letter to a short presentation of the formalism in the case of four identical particles ( next section ) followed by the results and a conclusion .",
    "in the case of four identical fermions interacting via a pair - wise potential v , the fy equations result in a set of two integrodifferential equations , coupling two fy amplitudes k and h : @xmath1\\cr ( e - h_0-v)h & = & v\\left[(p_{13}p_{24}+p_{14}p_{23 } ) \\;k + p_{13}p_{24}\\ ; h\\right ]   \\label{fye}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] , in which @xmath2 are the permutation operators .",
    "the wavefunction is given by : @xmath3\\ ;                  \\left [ 1 + \\varepsilon(p_{14}+p_{24}+p_{34 } ) \\right]k\\label{psi13}\\\\ \\psi_{2 + 2 } & = & \\left [ 1+\\varepsilon ( p_{13}+ p_{23}+ p_{14}+ p_{24 } ) + p_{13}p_{24}\\right]\\;h   \\label{psi22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each fy amplitude f = k , h is considered as a function of its own set of jacobi coordinates @xmath4 defined respectively by @xmath5 and expanded in angular variables for each coordinate according to @xmath6 the quantities @xmath7 are called regularized fy components and @xmath8 are tripolar harmonics containing spin , isospin and angular momentum variables .",
    "the label @xmath9 holds for the set of quantum numbers defined in a coupling scheme and includes the type of amplitude k or h. we have chosen the j - j coupling represented by @xmath10_{t_3 } t_4 \\right\\}_t \\otimes \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_x ( s_1 s_2)_{\\sigma_x } \\right)_{j_x } ( l_y s_3)_{j_y } \\right]_{j_3 } ( l_z s_4)_{j_z } \\right\\}_j\\cr h&\\equiv&\\left [ ( t_1 t_2)_{\\tau_x } ( t_3 t_4)_{\\tau_y } \\right]_t \\otimes \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_x ( s_1 s_2)_{\\sigma_x } \\right)_{j_x }   \\left ( l_y ( s_3 s_4)_{\\sigma_y } \\right)_{j_y } \\right]_{j_{xy } } l_z \\right\\}_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the spin and the isospin of the individual particles and @xmath13 the isospin and total angular momentum of the four - body state . each of the @xmath14 components in the expansion ( [ kpw ] ) is labeled by 12 quantum numbers , restricted by the antisymmetry properties to the conditions @xmath15 for k and @xmath16 for h.    the boundary conditions for a 1 + 3 scattering problem are implemented by imposing at large enough value of @xmath17 the dirichlet - type condition @xmath18 @xmath19 being the triton faddeev amplitudes with quantum numbers @xmath20_{j_3}$ ] .",
    "they ensure a solution which , e.g. for a relative n+t s - wave , behaves asymptotically like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the n+t phaseshift and @xmath23 , the conjugate momentum of the @xmath17-jacobi coordinate in k - amplitudes , is related to the center of mass n+t kinetic energy @xmath24 and the physical momentum @xmath25 by @xmath26",
    "the results we will present concern the @xmath27he bound state and the n+t elastic scattering in the relative s- and p- waves . they have been obtained with the av14 @xcite , nijm - ii and reid-93 @xcite nn interactions . they turned out to provide very similar predictions in the observables we have considered and we have chosen to give in more detail only the results of av14 .",
    "they will also be compared to the predictions of the s - wave phenomenological mt i - iii model published in @xcite .    for @xmath27he without coulomb forces",
    "we obtain the binding energies ( b ) and r.m.s radius ( @xmath28 ) displayed in table  [ tab_bs ] .",
    "the nn interaction is limited to @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 partial waves and the number of fy components in expansion ( [ kpw ] ) is limited to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the same as those listed in @xcite .",
    "the results provided by the different potentials are relatively close to each other but still far from the coulomb corrected experimental value @xmath34 mev . for av14",
    "they are in good agreement with the momentum space calculations , e.g. @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev from @xcite , while more complete calculations give as converged values @xmath37 mev @xcite and @xmath38 mev @xcite .",
    "for the two remaining potentials we present here the first calculations .",

    "the solutions of faddeev - yakubovsky equations in configuration space for the low energy neutron - triton scattering have been obtained by using several realistic nn interactions .",
    "the results obtained for the n+t scattering length and elastic cross section are compared to the existing data .",
    "the interactions considered , at least when limited to the nn s- and p - waves , fail in describing both the zero energy cross section and the n+t resonant structure observed at neutron @xmath39 mev .",
    "a phenomenological three - nucleon interaction has been included .",
    "it provides overall agreement for @xmath40h and @xmath27he binding energies as well as for the n+t s - wave scattering region .",
    "its effect is however negligible in the resonant region and the disagreement remains . including nn p - wave interactions",
    "does nt substantially modify this result .    on another hand",
    "the success obtained by using simple s - wave spin dependent potentials @xcite leads us to think that the combined effect of @xmath41 forces results in a simplified effective interaction , as happens in the nuclear structure calculations , and shows how little effectives the existing obep models are in describing the few nucleon systems .",
    "these results need to be confirmed and the convergence in expansion ( [ kpw ] ) pushed further . in their present state",
    "they suggest a basic inadequacy of the existing nn interactions in describing the n+t resonant states , a problem which can hardly be corrected in terms of three nucleon forces .",
