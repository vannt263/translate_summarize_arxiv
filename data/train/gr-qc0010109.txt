    "it has recently been suggested @xcite that the pair creation of black holes is possible in a background with a cosmological constant as this supplies the necessary negative potential energy . to investigate this process ,",
    "an exact solution of einstein s equations is required which represents a pair of black holes which accelerate away from each other in a de  sitter background .",
    "in fact , a general class of such solutions is available @xcite ( and used in @xcite ) which includes mass and charge parameters as well as a cosmological constant @xmath0 . when  @xmath1 ,  these solutions include the well - known c - metric which describes two black holes which uniformly accelerate in a minkowski background under the action of conical singularities @xcite .",
    "however , for  @xmath2 ,  the physical , geometrical and global properties of the space - time @xcite has not been investigated thoroughly even at the classical level .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to provide a physical interpretation for this family of exact solutions .",
    "we will show that indeed it represents ( possibly charged ) black holes uniformly accelerating in a de  sitter universe .",
    "this interpretation is obtained after first introducing a new coordinate system which is adapted to the motion of ( two ) uniformly accelerating test particles in de  sitter space .",
    "we will then show that , for small mass and charge parameters , some of the plebanski  demianski solutions @xcite can be regarded as perturbations of de  sitter space in these coordinates . this enables the physical meaning of the parameters to be determined .",
    "it is well - known that de  sitter space can be represented as a 4-hyperboloid @xmath3 in a 5-dimensional minkowski space . in the familiar parametrization by static coordinates ,",

    "the two maps given by ( [ static ] ) cover two causally disconnected areas  @xmath10  and  @xmath11  of the manifold .",
    "now , let us consider the timelike worldlines @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants .",
    "the 4-velocity is   @xmath16 ,  and the 4-acceleration is @xmath17 .  obviously , @xmath18 is the proper time since @xmath19 ,  and the 4-acceleration is constant with modulus @xmath20 since  @xmath21 ,  this constant value of @xmath22 is identical to the modulus of the 3-acceleration measured in the natural local orthonormal frame of the observer .",
    "the worldlines ( [ worldlines ] ) therefore represent the motion of _ uniformly _ accelerating observers in a de sitter universe .",
    "when  @xmath23 the worldline is a geodesic with zero acceleration . on the other hand , when  @xmath24 ,  the acceleration @xmath25 is unbounded and motion is along the null cosmological horizon . in general , these uniformly accelerated trajectories are given by constant values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the de  sitter hyperboloid , and coincide with the orbits of the isometry generated by the killing vector  @xmath29 .",
    "it is also instructive to visualise these accelerated observers in the standard global coordinate representation of de  sitter space : @xmath30 where @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] . with this ,",

    "comparing expressions for @xmath28 in ( [ static ] ) and ( [ global ] ) , it can be seen that the trajectories of accelerated observers are given by @xmath34 and indicated in fig .  1 .",
