    "although the exact nature of the low lying scalar mesons has been a topic of intense debate , the fact that these states play important roles in our understanding of low - energy qcd seems to be shared by all .",
    "various models have been put forward for the properties of the scalar mesons . a general discussion of the experimental situation on light scalars is given in ref .",
    "some characteristic treatments of the last twenty years are given in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in particular , an important",
    "four - quark ( i.e. two quarks and two antiquarks ) component , as was first proposed in the mit bag model @xcite , seems to explain some of their unusual properties such as the reversed mass spectrum .",
    "it has also been pointed out @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , that four quark components alone are not sufficient for understanding the physical parameters of these states but seems to rquire a scenario based on an underlying mixing between quark - antiquark nonets and nonets containing two quarks as well as two anti quarks .",
    "a simple picture for scalar states below 2 gev then seems to emerge .",
    "amusingly , this mixing @xcite automatically leads to light scalars that are dominantly of two quark- two antiquark nature and light conventional pseudoscalars that are , as expected from established phenomenology , dominantly of quark - antiquark nature .",
    "as some of the light scalar mesons ( such as the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 ) are very broad their lagrangian masses ( `` bare '' masses ) are considerably different from their pole locations in appropriate scattering amplitudes .",
    "the work of @xcite investigated in detail the `` bare '' mass spectrum of these states , as well as their internal structure by fitting the predictions of the model for various low - energy parameters to known experimental data .",
    "this fixed all lagrangian parameters ( to the leading order ) . in this paper , we work with the same lagrangian ( i.e. without introducing any new parameters ) and investigate the effect of unitarization on the isosinglet , zero angular momentum partial wave pi - pi scattering amplitude computed at tree order .",
    "we will treat the pion scattering amplitude unitarization by using the k - matrix method . as the model involves two nonets of scalars ,",
    "there are altogether four isosinglet scalar mesons ( two from each nonet ) that contribute as poles in the pion scattering amplitude .",
    "therefore the k - matrix unitarization has to deal with all four poles at the same time resulting in a more involved version of the conventional single - pole k - matrix unitarization .",
    "the advantages of the k - matrix approach to unitarization are that it does not introduce any new parameters and that it forces exact unitarity .",
    "it is plausible since if one starts from a pure pole in the partial wave amplitude , one ends up with a pure breit wigner shape .",
    "a disadvantage is that it neglects , in the simple version we use , the effects of the opening of thresholds like the @xmath4 on the pi pi amplitude .",
    "this is not expected to be too serious for our initial appraisal here .    in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief review of the lagrangian and the relevant formulas , followed by the k - matrix unitarization of the scattering amplitude in sec .",
    "iii and a summary and discussion of the results in sec .",
    "the model employs the 3@xmath53 matrix chiral nonet fields : @xmath6 the matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 transform in the same way under chiral su(3 ) transformations but may be distinguished by their different u(1)@xmath9 transformation properties .",
