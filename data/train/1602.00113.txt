    "we consider real planar polynomial differential systems of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real polynomials .",

    "so , can be written as @xmath5    when dealing with system ( [ eq1 ] ) one of the main problems is to determine the number and location of its limit cycles .",
    "recall that a limit cycle is an isolated periodic orbit of the system . for a given vector field , when",
    "it is not very near of a bifurcation , the limit cycles can usually be detected by numerical methods .",
    "a bifurcation is a qualitative change in the behaviour of a vector field as a parameter of the system is varied .",
    "this phenomenon can involve a change in the stability of a limit cycle or the creation or destruction of one or more limit cycles .",
    "if a periodic orbit is stable ( unstable ) , then forward ( backward ) numerical integration of a trajectory with an initial condition in its basin of attraction will converge to the periodic orbit as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "once for a given vector field a limit cycle is numerically detected there is no general method to rigourously prove its existence . in this work we present a procedure to prove the existence of a limit cycle in that situation .",
    "the method is based on the poincar  bendixson theorem , see for instance @xcite and also theorem  [ thpb ] .",
    "bendixson theorem ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thpb ] ) can be very useful to prove the existence of a limit cycle and to give a region where it is located .",
    "however , this result is hardly found in applications due to the difficulty of constructing the boundaries of a poincar  bendixson region .",
    "our aim in this work is to give a constructive procedure for finding transversal curves which define poincar  bendixson regions and thus , to prove the existence of limit cycles that have been numerically detected .",
    "consider a smooth and non - empty curve @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a class @xmath11 parametrization of @xmath8 , where @xmath12 is a real interval .",

    "when the above scalar product does not vanish we will say that the curve is _",

    "given @xmath30 , we consider the flow of system ( [ eq1 ] ) with initial point the one corresponding to @xmath33 and we follow this flow for positive values of @xmath34 .",
    "it can be shown , see for instance @xcite , that for @xmath35 small enough , the flow cuts @xmath29 again at some point corresponding to the parameter @xmath36",

    "see for instance @xcite , states that if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the parametrization of the limit cycle in the time variable @xmath34 of system ( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath46 is the period of @xmath28 , that is , the lowest positive value for which @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , then @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the _ divergence _ of @xmath51 . hence @xmath52 is the condition for a limit cycle @xmath28 to be hyperbolic .",

    "the poincar  bendixson theorem , which can be found for instance in ( * ? ? ?",

    "then , system ( [ eq1 ] ) has an odd number of limit cycles ( counted with multiplicity ) lying inside @xmath57 .",

    "we treated several examples for which we numerically knew the existence of a limit cycle , but we did not use this information . besides , we could not ensure the existence of the transversal conics . in the present work we give an answer to the following question : if one numerically knows the existence of a hyperbolic limit cycle , can one analytically prove the existence of such limit cycle ?",
    "in section [ sect2 ] we describe a method which answers this question in an affirmative way .",
    "the following theorem is the main result of this paper and it gives the theoretical basis of the method described in section [ sect2 ] .",
    "we prove :    [ th1 ] let @xmath60 \\}$ ] be a @xmath61-periodic hyperbolic limit cycle of  , parameterized by the time @xmath34 .",
    "define @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 then , the curve @xmath65 \\right\\}$ ] is @xmath61-periodic and , for @xmath66 small enough , it is strictly transversal to the flow associated to system .",
    "the proof of this result is given in section [ sectp ] .",
    "note that in its statement @xmath67 for all @xmath34 and @xmath68 because @xmath28 is hyperbolic .",
    "notice that as a consequence of the above result , the curve @xmath69 is a transversal oval close to the limit cycle @xmath28 for @xmath66 small enough , which is inside or outside it depending on the sign of @xmath70 .    as an illustration of the effectiveness of our approach",
    "we apply it to locate the limit cycles in two celebrated planar differential systems , the van der pol oscillator and the brusselator system , see sections  [ vdp ] and  [ bru ] , respectively . as we will see , the van der pol limit cycle is  easier \" to be treated than the one of the brusselator system . in section  [ nova ]",
    "we give an explanation for the different level of difficulty for studying both limit cycles .",
    "we prove that the different level of difficulty is hidden in the sizes of the respective fourier coefficients of the two limit cycles , see theorem  [ fita ] .",
    "this theorem also shows that our approach for detecting strictly transversal closed curves always works in finitely many steps .    finally , to show the applicability of the method to detect bifurcation values , we use it to find a sharp interval for the bifurcation value for a saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles for the rychkov system .",
    "recall that a saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles occurs when a stable limit cycle and an unstable limit cycle coalesce and become a double semi - stable limit cycle .",
    "a saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles corresponds to an elementary catastrophe of fold type .    in 1975",
    "rychkov(@xcite ) proved that the system @xmath71 with @xmath72 has at most 2 limit cycles .",
    "moreover , it is known that it has 2 limit cycles if and only if @xmath73 and @xmath74 for some unknown function @xmath75 for the value @xmath76 the system has a double limit cycle and , varying @xmath77 , it presents a saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles .",
    "this system is also studied by alsholm(@xcite ) and odani(@xcite ) .",
    "in particular odani proved that @xmath78    we believe that it is an interesting challenge to develop methods for finding sharp estimations of @xmath79 . here",
    "we will fix our attention on @xmath80 notice that odani s result implies that @xmath81 we prove :    [ rych ] let @xmath82 be the value for which the rychkov system @xmath83 has a semi - stable limit cycle",
    ". then @xmath84    the lower bound for @xmath85 is proved by using the tools introduced in this work .",
    "the upper bound is proved by constructing a polynomial function in @xmath86 of very high degree such that its total derivative with respect to the vector field does not change sign .",
    "this method is proposed and already developed for general classical linard systems by cherkas(@xcite ) and also by giacomini - neukirch ( @xcite ) .",
    "to prove that the curve @xmath69 is @xmath61-periodic simply notice that @xmath45 is @xmath61-periodic and that the function @xmath87 is @xmath61-periodic as well , due to its definition ( [ defu ] ) , because for any real integrable @xmath61-periodic function @xmath88 , the new function @xmath89 is also @xmath61-periodic .",
    "now , we show that the curve @xmath69 , for @xmath66 small enough , is strictly transversal to system .",
    "this follows once we prove that @xmath90 where we have introduced , to simplify notation , @xmath91    let us prove  .",
    "we drop the dependence on @xmath34 to simplify notation .",
    "since @xmath92 we have that @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath94 hence @xmath95 where @xmath96 to simplify @xmath97 , note that @xmath98 therefore , @xmath99 using that @xmath100 we have that @xmath101 thus , @xmath102 finally , we use the following simple and nice formula @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a @xmath105 matrix and @xmath106 is a vector . hence , @xmath107 as we wanted to prove .",
    "in fact , in the above proof , to show the transversality it is not used the specific value of @xmath108 . we only have used that it is a nonzero constant .",
    "hence , the following result holds :    given an orbit @xmath109 of system ( 1 ) , parameterized by the time @xmath34 , and a nonzero constant @xmath110 , then for @xmath66 small enough , the curve @xmath111 where @xmath112 is strictly transversal to the flow given by system .",
    "the proof goes as in the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , showing that @xmath113 where @xmath114 hence , for @xmath66 small enough , the sign of @xmath115 determines how the flow of system crosses the piece of curve @xmath116    this corollary can be useful to construct curves without contact to a piece @xmath28 of solution of , not closed , which are  parallel \" to it and such the flow crosses them either towards @xmath28 or in the opposite direction , as desired .",
