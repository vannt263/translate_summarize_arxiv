    "in the standard model(sm ) with fifteen fermions per family neutrinos are strictly massless and the charged leptons weak eigenstates can be chosen to be their mass eigenstates .",
    "thus , each generation has a separately conserved lepton number .",
    "if one neglects the tiny effects from nonperturbative processes , there is no lepton flavor violating(lfv ) interaction in sm .",
    "however , recent neutrino experiments show strong evidence that neutrinos have none zero masses and the three active neutrinos mix@xcite . most physicists take this to be a harbinger of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , finite neutrino masses alone would imply the existence of lfv in charged lepton sector analogous to the quarks .",
    "if so we expect the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani(gim ) mechanism to be operative in the lepton sector then the rate of induced lfv processes will be proportional to the neutrino mass square difference , which is of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , they will be hopelessly small for experimental verification . therefore , additional ingredients are essential for a detectable lfv signature .",
    "it is very common in model building to have the new physics that generate neutrino masses also given rise to lfv reactions .",
    "this link appears to be natural although there is no guarantee that this is case in nature . with this cautionary note",
    "we will focus attention to new physics that links the two phenomena .    among the numerous beyond the sm models ,",
    "lfv signatures are most intensely studied in supersymmetric ( susy ) ones .",
    "the connection with neutrino masses is established through the seesaw mechanism which is the orthodox way of getting a small mass for the active neutrinos .",
    "since the latter has a natural setting in grand unified theories ( gut ) the end result are rather bedecked supersymmetric seesaw models ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "although the details are different the generic source of lfv lies in the mixing of various sfermions .",
    "the right - handed majorana neutrinos play a secondary role in this class of models . in general",
    "it is natural to expect @xmath4 in susy models .    for non - supersymmetric models neutrino mass generation via the seesaw mechanism would required the right - handed neutrinos to be of the gut scale . in this simplest version",
    "all lfv are undetectable .",
    "attempts are now made to lower some right - handed neutrinos mandated by the seesaw mechanism to the tev scale so that the seesaw mechanism itself can be tested experimentally .",
    "if so then one can optimistically anticipate lfv signatures in the next round of experiments @xcite .",
    "independent of the details of the models one again expects @xmath4 to hold true .",
    "recently a new avenue has open up in the construction of models beyond the sm that exploits the possible existence of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "these theories are particularly interesting phenomenologically in the brane world context .",
    "it is fascinating that many long standing problems in the usual four dimensional ( 4d ) field theories can be overcome or take on new perspectives in these higher dimensional constructs .",
    "for example the hierarchy problem is solved by invoking large extra dimensions . in this note",
    ", we would like to draw the readers attention to the models which involve one or more flat extra spatial dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we focus on those that address the neutrino mass problem . in some cases , we predict a reversed pattern of @xmath5 compare to susy models . on the experimental side , it shall be interesting to see this .",
    "the current experimental limits on muon lfv have already put very stringent constraints on model building . on the other hand ,",
    "the limits from tau lfv are rather loose .",

    "we shall also discuss the possible ways to discriminate different models and their connections to neutrino masses .    in this brief review ,",
    "we give few examples of extra dimension models which give potentially testable lfv signatures .",
    "these lfv processes are all directly or indirectly related to the generation of neutrino masses .",
    "we compare the lfv processes in a five dimension(5d ) @xmath6@xcite and @xmath7@xcite gut models where neutrino majorana masses are generated radiatively without a right - handed neutrino which is viable but less discussed alternative to the seesaw mechanism .",

    "calculations of the lfv processes in this scenario involves many new unknown parameters .",

    "however , very general generic trends for lfv can be discerned even in this early stages of development .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",

    "first of all , we collect the necessary general formulas for the study of lfv processes .",
    "the most important ones are the effective interactions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 where we use the notation @xmath11 to denote the heavier charged lepton which usually is either @xmath12 or @xmath2 and @xmath13 is the lighter daughter lepton which can be @xmath12 or @xmath14 .    in lfv studies ,",
    "the most important contribution comes from the effective @xmath9 vertex .",
    "the similar vertex where a virtual @xmath15 replaces the @xmath16 is subdominant in the class of models we are considering . for definiteness we will take @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "only @xmath22 and @xmath23 contribute .",

    "this holds for subsequent discussions of @xmath2 decays .    to complete the story",

    "an interesting scenario was introduced by @xcite to solve the charged fermion masses hierarchy problem .",
    "the basic idea is to postulate that fermions are bulk fields and they interact with a non - dynamic background scalar potential . in the 5d version the bulk fermions are vectorlike , but only one of the chiral zero modes will be localized at the zero of the background potential modulated by the 5d mass terms .",
    "the chirality of the zero mode is determined by the sign of slope of the background potential at the zero point .",
    "the fermion zero modes are given a gaussian profile in the fifth dimension and each has its own unique position in the extra dimension .",
    "the widths are controlled by the potential slope at the localized position . for simplicity",

    "the 5d fermion excitation are vectorlike and will be located at the same position of their zero modes .",
    "roughly speaking , the energy gap is @xmath225 and they decouple from the phenomenology we are interested in .",

    "we take the extra dimension to be the interval @xmath227 $ ] and the fermions are fixed in different positions @xmath228 in this interval .",
    "the usual kaluza - klein ansatz is invoked that any bulk field factorizes into a 4d field times a 5d wave function .",

    "therefore , the linear displacement between left - handed and right - handed fermions in the fifth dimension translates into exponential yukawa hierarchy in 4d theory .",
    "one set of solution for the quarks positions have been found numerically that can accommodate the mass hierarchy and the ckm mixing@xcite . to accommodate the cp violation ,",
    "the overall yukawa coupling strength of up and down type quarks must be different@xcite .",
    "although a fundamental theory of where to place the fermions are located is lacking , we have at least one realistic solution for where the quarks are located in the extra dimension . for the lepton sector , we do nt have enough constraints to pin down the solution .",
    "as pointed out by@xcite , the fcnc interaction is induced geometrically where phenomenological constraint in quark sector have also been discussed .",
    "in fact , flavor violation is generic in any multi - position models .",
    "this comes from the fact that weak to mass eigenbasis rotations can only make the sm interactions ( zero modes ) flavor diagonal .",
