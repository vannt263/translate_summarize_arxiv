    "the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation plays an important role in many fields of nonlinear physics  @xcite .",

    "the nls equations with real external potentials and gain - and - loss distributions have been studied in many works  @xcite because the refractive index of optical materials is usually complex , i.e. , @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the real and imaginary parts , respectively . in optics ,",
    "the propagation of a signal is stable unless the propagation constant of the light is in real spectrum range .",
    "this requirement can be efficiently achieved if the gain - and - loss distributions in the medium are exactly balanced to ensure the relation @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , which is known as the parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetric systems  @xcite .",

    "recently , various @xmath0-symmetric potentials have been introduced to the nls equations , which have been shown to possess stable and unstable solitons of different types  @xcite .",
    "examples include the nls equations with @xmath0-symmetric scarff ii potential  @xcite , periodic potential  @xcite , harmonic potential  @xcite , rosen - morse potential  @xcite , gaussian potential  @xcite , sextic anharmonic double - well potential  @xcite , time - dependent harmonic - gaussian potential  @xcite , self - induced potential  @xcite , and etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one the other hand , due to the significant progress achieved in recent years on developing optical materials with adjustable refractive index , @xmath8-symmetric optical systems made of solid - state waveguides and fiber networks  @xcite , multi - level atomic systems  @xcite , and microcavities  @xcite have been suggested or realized experimentally .",
    "these practical systems provide a solid ground for the study of solitons in the nls model with @xmath0-symmetric potentials .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric potentials play a key role in the wave propagation in the nls equations in fibre and waveguide optics . as an example , the wave propagation with a @xmath0-symmetric scarff ii potential in both linear and nonlinear models has been studied in recent years  @xcite . the @xmath0-symmetric scarff ii potential can support stable bright solitons in the nls models within particular parameter regions  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0-symmetric @xmath1-wavenumber scarff ii potential  @xcite both approach to zero as @xmath9 [ cf .",

    "in addition , the study of optical solitons could be very useful in the information science .",
    "for example , one can use optical solitons in coding for secured optical communication , etc .    in this work",
    "we propose a unified study of the optical bright solitons governed by self - focusing and defocusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations with generalized @xmath0-symmetric scarff ii potentials .",
    "particularly , we consider a @xmath0-symmetric @xmath1-wavenumber scarff ii potential and a multi - well scarff ii potential , respectively . for the @xmath1-wavenumber scarff ii potential , we show that by using two @xmath1-wavenumber rays and a @xmath1-wavenumber parabola one can divide the parameter space @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the real and imaginary parts of the potential ) in different regions , corresponding to unbroken and broken @xmath0-symmetry and the bright solitons with self - focusing and defocusing kerr nonlinearities . for the multi - well scarff ii potential we obtain bright solitons by using a periodically space - modulated kerr nonlinearity .",
    "then , we analyze the linear stability of bright solitons for both potentials in details by using numerical simulations .",
    "surprisingly , stable and unstable bright solitons are found in both regions of unbroken and broken @xmath0-symmetry due to the existence of the nonlinearity .",
    "furthermore , we explore the bright solitons in three - dimensional ( 3d ) self - focusing and defocusing nls equations with a generalized @xmath0-symmetric scarff ii potential .    turning to the possible experimental implementation of the models we will study",

    "the required spatial distribution of the refractive index ( i.e. , the @xmath1-wavenumber and multi - well scarff ii potentials ) can be achieved by a proper combination of a control laser field and a far - off - resonance stark laser field . since the refractive index of the atomic vapor",
    "is determined by two external laser fields , whose intensities can be lowered to several microwatts achievable for the lasers nowadays , the system has the advantages of real - time all - optical tunable capability and controllable @xmath0-symmetry accuracy .",
    "in addition , the studied model supports a large kerr nonlinearity ( which is at least @xmath22-order larger than those measured for usual nonlinear optical materials ) due to the raman resonant character , which favors to the formation of optical bright solitons .",
