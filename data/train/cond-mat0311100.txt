    "usually the dominant interatomic interactions in an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) are asymptotically of the van der waals ( vdw ) type , which falls off as @xmath1 and is short - range in comparison to the de  broglie wavelength of the atoms .",
    "these interactions can be incorporated into a mean - field description of the condensate via a delta - function pseudo - potential @xcite @xmath2 involving just the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath3 and atomic mass @xmath4 .",
    "the interactions then appear as a cubic non - linearity in the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite for the order parameter @xmath5 of a trapped zero - temperature bec @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the chemical potential .",
    "the trapping potential , @xmath8 , due to a magnetic or optical trap is typically harmonic , @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the thomas - fermi regime for a trapped bec is reached when the zero - point kinetic energy is vanishingly small in comparison to both the potential energy due to the trap and the interaction energy between atoms @xcite .",
    "many of the current atomic bec experiments @xcite satisfy these conditions , which tend to hold for condensates containing a large number of atoms .",
    "when the kinetic energy is neglected the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gpe ] ) can be trivially solved for the static condensate density , @xmath10/g \\ \\",
    "\\mathrm{for}\\ n({\\mathbf{r}})\\geq0,\\ ] ] and @xmath11 elsewhere .",
    "thus the density profile is completely determined by the trapping potential , and in a harmonic trap @xmath12 has an ( inverted ) parabolic profile and the same aspect ratio as the trap .    our aim here is to obtain similar exact results for a bec in which dipole - dipole interactions play an important role .",
    "compared to the vdw interaction the dipolar interaction is long - range and anisotropic , and consequently these systems can be expected to exhibit novel behavior including unusual stability properties @xcite , exotic ground states such as supersolid @xcite and checkerboard phases @xcite , and modified excitation spectra @xcite , even to the extent of a roton minimum @xcite in the dispersion relation .",
    "we have recently reported on the exact dynamics of a dipolar bec in the thomas - fermi limit @xcite , including the quadrupole and monopole shape oscillation frequencies . here",
    "we give the full derivation of the static solution , which was only stated in @xcite , and investigate stability and electrostriction ( change in volume due to an applied electric field ) .",
    "we also calculate the dipole - dipole potential outside the boundary of the condensate , which has a bearing on the distribution of thermal atoms and on the stability of a dipolar bec , but also on a lattice array of dipolar becs , since the effective giant dipole on each site is coupled to its neighbors by dipole - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "the long - range part of the interaction between two dipoles separated by @xmath13 , and aligned by an external field along a unit vector @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 where the coupling @xmath16 depends on the specific realization .",
    "marinescu and you @xcite investigated the low - energy scattering of two atoms with dipole - dipole interactions induced by a static electric field , @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 . yi and you @xcite then went on to consider a bec composed of such atoms .",
    "another possible scenario is permanent magnetic dipoles , @xmath19 , aligned by an external magnetic field , @xmath20 , leading to a coupling @xmath21 .",
    "a bec with magnetic dipole - dipole interactions was first discussed by gral , rzaewski , and pfau @xcite .",
    "a measure of the strength of the long - range dipole - dipole interaction relative to the s - wave scattering energy is provided by the dimensionless quantity @xmath22 this definition arises naturally from an analysis of the frequencies of collective excitations ( bogoliubov spectrum ) in a _ homogeneous _ dipolar bec @xcite .",
    "as we shall see later on , the bec is stable as long as @xmath23 , but loses that stability in the thomas - fermi limit when @xmath24 .",
    "note that in the presence of a strong electric field the @xmath0-wave scattering length can be modified @xcite , and therefore @xmath25 and hence @xmath26 should be treated as effective quantities when dealing with electrically induced dipoles .",
    "although the magnetic interaction between two atoms is often masked by a stronger @xmath0-wave interaction , two recent proposals indicate how magnetic dipolar effects can be enhanced , either by rotating the magnetic field in resonance with a collective excitation frequency of the system @xcite , or by using a feshbach resonance to reduce the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "other suggestions to realize becs with strong dipolar interactions include polar molecules @xcite and rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "laser induced ( dynamic ) dipole - dipole interactions differ from the static case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : staticdipdip ] ) by extra retarded terms , including an @xmath27 term which is always attractive ; they are discussed in references @xcite and @xcite . in certain situations",
    "this very long - range part of the interaction is important and can be responsible for unique features such as self - binding , and plasmon - like collective excitations . here ,",
    "however , we confine ourselves to the static case , which could be realized by static fields but also by using a laser provided the atomic separation is considerably smaller than the laser wavelength .",
    "proceeding from the thomas - fermi equation for a static bec , i.e.  the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation without the kinetic energy term , we seek an exact solution for the density , @xmath12 , of a condensate with both dipole - dipole interactions and the usual short - range @xmath0-wave scattering in a harmonic trap , which for simplicity ( though not necessity ) we take to be cylindrically symmetric ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the thomas - fermi equation then reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the mean - field potential due to dipole - dipole interactions @xmath32 the intuitive form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phidd ] ) , which corresponds to the born approximation for two - body scattering , has been shown by yi and you @xcite to be accurate for dipole moments of the order of a bohr magneton and collisions away from any shape resonances .",
    "recently derevianko @xcite proposed a more sophisticated approach to the dipolar scattering problem which suggests that dipole - dipole interactions can be substantially larger than previously estimated @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that , provided the condensate is not too strongly deformed , the basic form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phidd ] ) with the bare interaction ( [ eq : staticdipdip ] ) remains valid , albeit with a renormalized coupling @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the presence of the non - local dipolar mean - field potential @xmath31 means that the thomas - fermi eq.([eq : tfeqn ] ) is an integral equation and so less trivial to solve than in the purely local delta - function pseudo - potential case .",
    "however , it is straightforward to demonstrate that this equation also admits an inverted - parabola as a self - consistent solution .",
    "we begin our analysis with a suggestive re - casting of the dipole - dipole term using the mathematical identity @xmath34 we can then write @xmath35 the problem thereby reduces to an analogy with electrostatics , and we need only calculate the ` potential ' @xmath36 arising from the ` static charge ' distribution @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 given by ( [ eq : electrostaticgreen2 ] ) must obey poisson s equation @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt the following inverted - parabola as an ansatz for the density profile of an @xmath38-atom condensate @xmath39 \\ \\",

    "( [ eq : electrostaticgreen1 ] ) , the physical dipolar contribution @xmath31 to the mean - field potential inside the inverted - parabola bec ( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) will now itself also be _ parabolic _ , just like the potentials due to the harmonic trap and the local @xmath0-wave scattering interaction . thus the thomas - fermi equation ( [ eq : tfeqn ] )",
    "contains only parabolic and constant terms and so , remarkably , just as in the pure @xmath0-wave case , in the presence of dipole - dipole interactions a parabolic density profile is also an exact solution of the thomas - fermi problem in a harmonic trap , although this time we should expect that the condensate aspect ratio differs from that of the trap .",
    "it remains to determine the coefficients appearing in ( [ eq : generalform ] ) and in ( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) and adjust them in such a way that the thomas - fermi equation is satisfied . to this end",
    "we shall evaluate the integral ( [ eq : electrostaticgreen2 ] ) for a density of the form ( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) .",
    "this is an arduous task because the domain of integration is bounded by and has the symmetry of a spheroid or , in the general case , even of an ellipsoid .",
    "calculating the integral is possible only if one takes explicit account of this symmetry , and we shall demonstrate two independent ways of doing that .",
    "one is to transform into spheroidal coordinates , use the known green s function of poisson s equation in these coordinates @xcite , and subsequently transform back into cartesian coordinates .",
    "the other is to start from basics and integrate over successive thin ellipsoidal shells .",
    "while the former approach is also quite involved it is simpler than the latter .",
    "however , if we were to drop our simplifying assumption of cylindrical symmetry , the second approach is the only workable as the general solution of poisson s equation in general ellipsoidal coordinates is unmanageably complicated because the separation constants do not separate in these coordinates @xcite .",
    "the second approach is presented in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "we now demonstrate the green s function approach",

    "substituting @xmath31 into the thomas - fermi eq.([eq : tfeqn ] ) and comparing the coefficients of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and 1 , yields three coupled equations . the first equation , due to the constant terms , gives the chemical potential @xmath91 .",

    "the radii @xmath54(@xmath94 ) and @xmath41 of the exact parabolic solution ( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) are obtained from the coefficients of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "in fact , a property such as the aspect ratio is insensitive to the details of the density profile and eq.([eq : transcendental ] ) has been obtained previously from a gaussian variational ansatz for the density @xcite .",

    "the bec becomes exactly spherical when @xmath100 .    in order to illustrate the static properties of the thomas - fermi solution for a dipolar bec we imagine an experiment with a large fixed number of atoms , @xmath38 , in a trap set to a particular aspect ratio , @xmath101 , where the value of @xmath26 is adiabatically increased from zero .",
    "for electrically induced dipoles this would involve increasing the electric field , whereas for magnetic dipoles one could either rotate the external magnetic field , gradually changing the angle of rotation @xcite , or reduce the @xmath0-wave scattering length using a feshbach resonance .",
    "the system then follows one of the curves shown in figures [ fig : aspect ] and [ fig : aspect2 ] . in the absence of the external field , when @xmath102",

    "as long as @xmath105 , the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) has a single solution , @xmath85 , for any choice of trap , @xmath101 .",
    "the behavior for @xmath106 is more complicated and requires an analysis of the stability properties of a dipolar bec , which we give in the next but one section .",
    "for a variety of applications it is very useful to know the potential outside a dipolar condensate .",
    "for example , in an array of dipolar becs on a lattice the condensate at each lattice site can behave as a single mesoscopic spin @xcite . in order to determine the spin - spin coupling between sites",
    "one needs to know the external potential generated by each condensate . in section [ subsec : saturn ] below we shall see that the knowledge of the outside potential also gives insight into the problem of the stability of a single dipolar condensate .    in order to calculate @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phidd ] ) outside the condensate , we again use relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) and write the outside dipole - dipole potential in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : electrostaticgreen1 ] ) , except that the term with @xmath108 does not arise because @xmath109 is obviously zero outside the condensate . using the green s function in prolate spheroidal coordinates we find for the potential ( [ eq : electrostaticgreen2 ] ) outside @xmath110\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as before , only @xmath111 actually contribute to the sum . in the oblate case",
    "a similar formula applies , with just @xmath49 and @xmath112 replaced by i@xmath49 and i@xmath112 and the @xmath112 integration running from 0 to @xmath113 .",
    "we obtain @xmath114 \\ln \\frac{\\xi+1}{\\xi-1 } \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the prolate case , and @xmath115 ( \\pi-2\\arctan\\xi ) \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the oblate case .",
    "these expressions can easily be converted back from prolate or oblate spheroidal coordinates @xmath116 into cartesian coordinates , as was described above , by substituting @xmath117 and @xmath118 for prolate spheroidal coordinates , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 for oblate spheroidal coordinates .    while easy to obtain , the expression for @xmath119 is rather lengthy and unwieldy in cartesian coordinates .",
    "thus , if one has to work in cartesian coordinates , one may prefer the asymptotic expression for the dipole - dipole interaction potential at large distances @xmath120 , which is approximately @xmath121 \\ ; , \\label{eq : phiddoutside}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and holds for both prolate and oblate condensates .",
    "it turns out that this asymptotic expression serves remarkably well even quite close to the condensate .",
    "we give a derivation from integration over thin ellipsoidal shells in appendix b. note that equation ( [ eq : phiddoutside ] ) says that to a first approximation , when seen from outside the dipolar condensate behaves like a single giant dipole of n - times the single - atom dipole magnitude .",
    "the higher multipoles depend on the shape of the bec .",
    "the partially attractive nature of the dipole - dipole interaction ( [ eq : staticdipdip ] ) has been widely predicted @xcite to lead to a collapse of the bec when the dipolar interaction strength exceeds a certain critical value , @xmath122 . in the thomas - fermi limit @xmath122",
    "depends only upon the trap aspect ratio @xmath101 .",
    "both the parabolic solution presented here and the gaussian variational ansatz indicate that above @xmath122 the system is liable to collapse towards an infinitely thin and long prolate ` pencil ' oriented along the field polarization direction i.e.  @xmath123 , since the system lowers its energy by arranging the dipoles end - to - end . however , in reality a transition to another ( more structured ? )",
    "state ( see @xcite ) presumably occurs in preference to the system becoming truly singular . bearing this in mind we shall consider below three nominally different types of instability : local density perturbations , ` scaling ' deformations , and the ` saturn - ring ' instability .",
    "the latter occurs due to a peculiarity in the potential that would be seen by an atom located _ outside _ the boundary of the bec , and may result in a previously unforeseen type of instability .",
    "all of them predict the onset of instability when @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless , we have included in the figures values of @xmath26 exceeding unity , our justification being partly mathematical curiosity , and partly the fact that the inclusion of kinetic energy would extend the stability of a dipolar bec beyond that of the strict thomas - fermi limit considered here .",
    "phonons have already been predicted @xcite to cause instabilities in a _ homogeneous _ dipolar bec when @xmath125 .",
    "this can be seen directly from the bogoliubov dispersion relation between the energy @xmath126 and momentum @xmath127 for phonons in the gas @xmath128 which can become imaginary when @xmath125 , indicating an instability .",
    "this dispersion relation has an angular dependence ( @xmath129 is the angle between the momentum of the phonon and the external polarizing field ) which further illustrates the richness of dipolar systems in comparison to the usual non - dipolar case .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bogdispersion ] ) is derived by adding to the fourier transform , @xmath25 , of the contact interaction @xmath130 that appears in the usual bogoliubov dispersion relation , the fourier transform , @xmath131 , of the dipole - dipole interaction ( [ eq : staticdipdip ] ) .",
    "this is an approximation that assumes , as we do throughout this paper , that there is no screening of two dipoles by the other dipoles lying between them and also that the scattering of these two particles by the dipole - dipole interaction takes place within the born approximation , as mentioned above in sec .",
    "[ sec : tfeqn ] .    in a trapped bec with negligible kinetic energy , as considered here , we should expect an analogous instability due to local density perturbations having a wavelength much smaller than the dimensions of the condensate .",
    "for example , santos _ et al _ @xcite recently showed that an infinite - pancake dipolar bec , homogenous in two directions and parabolic in the third , is unstable when @xmath125 for a density exceeding a critical value .",
    "we use the term ` scaling ' deformation to describe perturbations that merely re - scale the parabolic solution ( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) , i.e.  that change @xmath40 and @xmath41 from their equilibrium values ( [ eq : rxsol ] ) , but leave the basic form of the parabolic solution the same . since the equilibrium values of the radii are determined by the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) , which also occurs in the context of a gaussian variational solution , much of what we shall say below has already been described by other authors , including santos _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and yi and you @xcite .",
    "information on the stability of the parabolic solution can be gained from analyzing the behavior of the energy functional @xmath132 evaluated over a general parabolic density profile ( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) @xmath133 \\label{eq : energyfunctional}\\ ] ] in the vicinity of the solution ( [ eq : rxsol ] ) and ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) and across the whole parameter space ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "one finds that for @xmath105 the solution given by the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) is always stable , in the sense that it corresponds to a global minimum of the energy functional . as @xmath26",
    "is increased and passes through unity , the solution matches smoothly onto one that is only metastable , i.e.  it is only a local minimum in the energy landscape , and the global minimum is then a ( prolate ) collapsed state with @xmath135 . simultaneously with the turning of the stable into a metastable solution , a second branch of solutions appear at a smaller value of @xmath85 , which correspond to unstable saddle points that separate the local minimum of the metastable solution from the global minimum of the collapsed state at @xmath136 in the energy landscape . if one continues to increase @xmath26 then one of two things happens , depending on the value of @xmath101 : if @xmath101 is less than a critical value , @xmath137 , then , as @xmath26 increases , eventually the metastable and unstable solutions coalesce at @xmath138 , above which there are no solutions , not even metastable ones , and the energy landscape is just a continuous slope down towards a collapsed state with @xmath136 .",
    "this critical value @xmath122 as a function of @xmath101 is plotted in figure [ fig : ecrit ] .",
    "if , however , @xmath139 then something rather surprising happens . as first remarked by santos _",
    "et al _ @xcite , when @xmath139 there exists a solution metastable to scaling perturbations at a finite value of @xmath85 for all values of @xmath26 , strictly speaking even for @xmath140 .",

    "@xcite but is that same as the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for completeness we would like to mention that prima facie the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transcendental ] ) for @xmath125 has solutions also for @xmath142 .",
    "these come in pairs , one corresponding to a maximum and the other to a saddle point in the energy landscape .",
    "however , inspection reveals that these solutions have no physical relevance as for them the radius @xmath54 of the condensate , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rxsol ] ) , comes out imaginary .",
    "an examination of the dipolar potential outside the condensate , that is seen , for example by a single test atom placed beyond the boundary @xmath143 , reveals a new type of possible instability . like the local density perturbations ,",
    "it also does not preserve the parabolic form of the density profile .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath125 the potential seen by atoms just outside the condensate exhibits a local minimum , i.e. the sum of trap and dipole - dipole potentials is locally lower than the chemical potential , which causes atoms to spill out from the condensate and fill this dip in the potential .",
    "such an effect is peculiar to condensates with induced dipole - dipole interactions because these are long - range and thus give rise to a potential even outside the condensate , whereas the potential due to @xmath0-wave scattering is short - range and thus zero outside the condensate . to investigate the dip in the outside potential we need to use the dipolar potential ( [ eq : outprolate],[eq : outoblate ] ) that we calculated in section [ sec : outside ] .",
    "as the expressions are rather awkward in cartesian coordinates , we shall analyze them in spheroidal coordinates .",
    "the outside potential @xmath144 is the sum of the trap potential and the dipole - dipole interaction potential @xmath145 .",
    "the trap potential is positive and monotonically rising from the center .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction potential outside the condensate is a solution of the ( homogeneous ) laplace equation , i.e.@xmath145 is a harmonic function . thus the maximum principle applies , and @xmath145 must assume its maximum and minimum on the boundaries of the domain , either at infinity or on the surface of the condensate . at infinity the dipole - dipole potential vanishes , which means that at large distances the total outside potential is positive and dominated by the trap potential .",
    "to ascertain whether the outer potential @xmath144 has a local minimum one only needs to check whether the sum of trap and dipole - dipole potentials has a negative first derivative at the surface of the condensate in some outward direction .",
    "it is easy to see that local minima of @xmath144 can occur only for @xmath146 : at a local minimum of @xmath144 its first derivative with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath52 must vanish , but both the trap potential and the dipole - dipole potential are quadratic in @xmath52 , so that the first derivative @xmath147 is proportional to @xmath52 and thus vanishes only for @xmath146 unless it vanishes for all @xmath52 .",
    "therefore we only need to examine the derivative @xmath148 at @xmath146 ; we find @xmath149 } \\label{eq : firstderiv}\\ ] ] where @xmath150 is the value of the spheroidal variable @xmath49 on the surface of the condensate , i.e.  @xmath151 for a prolate bec and @xmath152 for an oblate bec . for oblate becs the denominator in eq .",

    "whenever @xmath148 is negative on the condensate surface , a local minimum of the potential lies somewhere outside the surface .",
    "the fact that this happens at @xmath146 means that the local dip in the potential occurs along a ring at @xmath154 around the condensate , and the flowing out of atoms from the main condensate into the dip causes the condensate to take on a saturn - like appearance , which then leads to further instability .",

    "the figure shows that condensates in prolate traps and slightly oblate traps ( with @xmath160 ) get compressed by increasing dipolar interactions , while condensates in traps with aspect ratios above @xmath161 are being pulled apart as @xmath26 rises . between @xmath162 and @xmath141",
    "is a range of trap aspect ratios for which the condensate is pulled apart at first but eventually compressed into collapse by higher values of the dipolar interaction strength .",
    "if , during an experiment , the condensate was imaged in the trap then the volume could be measured either directly from the radii , or by the central density which is inversely proportional to the volume , @xmath163 .",
    "if the trap is turned off the condensate expands ballistically and the @xmath0-wave and dipole - dipole interaction energies are converted into kinetic energy , the so - called release energy , which can be measured in an experiment . for the exact parabolic solution the release energy is given by @xmath164/(28 \\pi r_{x}^{2 } r_{z}).\\ ] ] the release energy can also be expressed in terms of the chemical potential ( [ eq : chemical_potential ] ) as @xmath165 , which is the standard expression for the thomas - fermi limit @xcite .",
    "the long - range anisotropic nature of dipole - dipole interactions gives condensates composed of dipolar atoms or molecules novel properties compared to those with only short - range interactions .",
    "furthermore , the dipole - dipole interactions can be controlled in sign , magnitude and direction .",
    "we have shown that a simple inverted parabola remains an exact solution for the density - profile of a harmonically trapped dipolar bec in the thomas - fermi limit by calculating the dipolar potential both inside and outside the condensate region .",
    "the parabolic solution is stable , in the strict thomas - fermi limit , only for @xmath166 .",
    "for @xmath153 it is unstable against scaling perturbations as seen in the energy functional , against perturbations of different symmetry , such as phonons , and also due to a local minimum appearing in the potential outside the condensate .",
    "the effect of the dipole - dipole interactions upon the bec is to change both its aspect ratio and its volume .",
    "the manner of this electrostriction depends on the aspect ratio of the external trap ; as a function of the strength of the dipole - dipole interactions ( relative to the @xmath0-wave scattering ) the volume of the bec can either increase or decrease , or even initially increase and then decrease at higher values of the coupling .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank gabriel barton and tilman pfau for discussions .",
    "we would like to acknowledge financial support from the uk engineering and physical sciences research council ( d.od . ) and from the european union ( s.g . ) , and we are indebted to the royal society for a university research fellowship ( c.e . ) .",
    "here we demonstrate how the potential ( [ eq : resultphi ] ) can be obtained by integrating over successive thin shells , a method that works even in the general case of an ellipsoid .",
    "the problem of the electrostatic / gravitational field within and outside a charged / massive ellipsoid is associated with some of the great names of nineteenth century mathematical physics . in his 1892 treatise on statics ,",
    "routh @xcite notes that chasles , dirichlet , jacobi , and poisson all made contributions .",
    "rodrigues is credited with being the first to evaluate the potential of a solid ellipsoid of constant density , seemingly in 1815 , and in 1833 green @xcite `` treated the subject in a very general manner '' giving solutions for various cases of inhomogeneous density , as in the current situation .",
    "our derivation is adapted from routh .",
    "although we take a cylindrically symmetric density as input , the derivation holds for the general ellipsoidal case .",
    "consider an ellipsoidal surface @xmath167 , having semi - axes ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "a continuous family of concentric _ similar _ ellipsoids lying inside this outer surface can then be defined via the semi - axes ( @xmath169 ) , where @xmath170 .",
    "note that by similar we mean that this family all share the same aspect ratios among their semi - axes , but are consequently _ not _ confocal . a surface which is _ confocal _ to",
    "the original surface obeys @xmath171 , so that @xmath172 is obviously the original surface , and surfaces with @xmath173 lie outside the original .",
    "considered in terms of the parameterization specified by @xmath0 , the parabolic density profile can be written as @xmath174 . since the equi - density surfaces within the density profile are similar , when computing the integral ( [ eq : electrostaticgreen2 ] ) it makes sense to take as our basic volume element a thin `` homoeoid''@xcite , defined as the shell bounded by two similar ellipsoidal surfaces , parameterized by @xmath0 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "the volume of the thin homoeoid is @xmath176 . when computing the potential at a point @xmath177 within a charged ellipsoid the contribution from the homoeoids interior to that point is of a different nature to that from those exterior to it , so we consider the two parts separately .",
    "let @xmath180 denote the contribution to the total potential @xmath181 from a thin homoeoid shell .",
    "in this section we require the potential @xmath182 _ outside _ a thin homoeoid , labelled by its inner surface @xmath0 , whose ` charge ' density is @xmath174 .",
    "the equi - potential surfaces outside a charged thin homoeoid @xmath0 are confocal ellipsoids @xcite @xmath183 in our analogy ( in which the dielectric constant @xmath184 ) the ` potential ' on a confocal surface @xmath185 outside a thin homoeoid labelled by @xmath0 , of density @xmath186 and volume @xmath187 is @xmath188 this potential is most easily obtained by noticing that the ` charge ' distribution on the homoeoid is identical to that of a solid ellipsoidal _ conductor _ with the same external dimensions and with the same total ` charge ' ( @xmath189 ) distributed over its surface .",
    "a homoeoid shell does not have uniform thickness , @xmath190 , being slightly thicker at the points furthest from the center @xmath191 if , rather than a shell of thickness @xmath190 we consider the ` charge ' it contains to in fact be surface charge , of variable surface density @xmath192 , i.e.  so that @xmath193 , we obtain exactly the same @xmath192 as in the well - known problem of the charged ellipsoid conductor ( see , e.g.@xcite ) , and thus the resulting potentials are also the same .",
    "having established the potential due to a homoeoid shell we must integrate over all the shells @xmath0 lying inside @xmath179 , which is located on the confocal surface @xmath185 . while @xmath179 is of course fixed in space , the surface @xmath185 passing through it is a different surface ( i.e.  different aspect ratio ) for each homoeoid , i.e. @xmath194 , becoming at the last instant a similar surface to the final homoeoid ( upon which @xmath179 itself sits ) . to simplify the algebra we put @xmath195 in the equation for the ellipsoidal surface ( [ eq : confocalsurface ] ) .",
    "we see that if @xmath196 then @xmath197 . we choose @xmath198 to describe the similar ellipsoidal surface upon which @xmath179 lies , and thus we have @xmath199 for @xmath198 . to obtain the potential due to the charge interior to @xmath179",
    "we must evaluate @xmath200 .",
    "setting @xmath201 in the integral ( [ eq : homoeoidpotential ] ) , we find @xmath202 which can be integrated by parts to give @xmath203\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\times\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}\\sigma}{\\sqrt{(r_{x}^{2}+\\sigma ) ( r_{y}^{2}+\\sigma)(r_{z}^{2}+\\sigma)}}\\right\\}\\ ; , \\label{eq : homoeoidpotentialinterior}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second term we have used leibniz s formula for differentiating an integral and used eq.([eq : confocalsurface ] ) to replace @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the potential inside a homoeoid is much simpler to calculate since , just as in the case of the spherical shell , it is a constant , independent of position @xcite .",
    "returning to the solid ellipsoidal conductor model , the potential throughout a conductor is the same as on the surface defined by @xmath172 .",
    "thus @xmath207 note that because the lower limit of the integral is this time independent of @xmath0 the ensuing treatment is simple .",
    "integrating from the surface @xmath208 , which includes @xmath179 , out the boundary @xmath209 , we require @xmath210 .",
    "making once again the substitution @xmath201 one immediately finds @xmath211 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}v}{\\sqrt{(r_{x}^{2}+v)(r_{y}^{2}+v)(r_{z}^{2}+v)}}\\;. \\label{eq : homoeoidpotentialexterior}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    combining eqs .",
    "[ eq : homoeoidpotentialinterior ] and [ eq : homoeoidpotentialexterior ] we see that the parameter @xmath208 drops from the sum @xmath212 . in the general ellipsoidal case",
    "the remaining integrals in @xmath213 can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals . in the spheroidal case ( @xmath40 ) they can be written in terms of more elementary functions .",
    "there are two cases to distinguish , depending upon whether the density profile is prolate ( a cigar ) , @xmath53 , or oblate ( a pancake ) , @xmath73 .",
    "if we define @xmath214 then the total potential at @xmath179 is most compactly expressed as @xmath215 and is identical to the green s function result ( [ eq : resultphi ] ) .",
    "the relationship between the function @xmath216 defined in the green s function approach and @xmath217 defined here is simply @xmath218 .",
    "the calculation of the potential at a point @xmath179 outside the boundary of the condensate follows very similar lines to that presented above for a point inside .",
    "the main difference is that one no longer has to consider ` charge ' located exterior to @xmath179 .",
    "the result is identical to eq.([eq : totalpotentialhomoeoid ] ) except that the integral @xmath217 is now given by      where @xmath185 parameterizes an ellipse , confocal to the outer - boundary of the condensate , upon which the point @xmath179 sits , and so obeys the quadratic equation @xmath220 . when solving for @xmath185",
    "one should take the positive solution @xmath221    note that expressing the solution for the potential @xmath181 in the form ( [ eq : totalpotentialhomoeoid ] ) requires that when taking the derivatives with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath41 then @xmath185 is to be treated as a constant and is _ not _ to be differentiated . on the other hand ,",
    "when going on to calculate the dipolar potential outside the bec , @xmath222 , then @xmath185 _ is _ to be treated as a function of @xmath223 , and should be differentiated .",
    "this makes the exact expression for @xmath224 outside the condensate complicated .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath225 , @xmath226 , one may use the asymptotic result @xmath227 which turns out in practice to be remarkably accurate , even right up to the condensate surface providing the condensate is not too aspherical ( in which case the next terms in the multipole expansion should included . )"
