    "a complex affine variety @xmath2 is called _ rigid _ if it does not admit non trivial algebraic actions of the additive group @xmath3 .",
    "this is the case for `` most '' affine varieties , for instance for every affine curve different from the affine line @xmath4 and for every affine variety whose normalization has non negative logarithmic kodaira dimension .",
    "the notion was actually introduced by crachiola and makar - limanov in @xcite under the more algebraic equivalent formulation that the _ makar - limanov invariant _",
    "@xmath5 of @xmath2 , which is defined as the algebra consisting of regular functions on @xmath2 invariant under all algebraic @xmath6-actions , is equal to the coordinate ring @xmath7 of @xmath2 .    among many important questions concerning this invariant , the understanding of its behavior under the operation consisting of taking cylinders @xmath8 , @xmath9 , over a given affine variety",
    "@xmath2 has focused a lot of attention during the last decade , in connexion with the zariski cancellation problem .",
    "of course , rigidity is lost even when passing to the cylinder @xmath10 since these admit non trivial @xmath6-actions by translations on the second factor .",
    "but one could expect that such actions are essentially the unique possible ones in the sense that the projection @xmath11 is invariant for every @xmath6-action on @xmath10 , a property which translates algebraically to the fact that @xmath12 .",
    "this property was indeed established by makar - limanov @xcite and this led to wonder more generally whether a rigid variety is _ stably rigid _ in the sense that the equality @xmath13 holds for arbitrary @xmath9 .",
    "stable rigidity of smooth affine curves is easily confirmed as a consequence of the fact that a smooth rigid curve does not admit any dominant morphism from the affine line , and more generally every rigid affine curve is in fact stably rigid @xcite .",
    "stable rigidity is also known to hold for smooth factorial rigid surfaces by virtue of a result of crachiola @xcite , and without any indication of a potential counter - example , it seems that the implicit working conjecture so far has been that every rigid affine variety should be stably rigid .    in this article",
    ", we construct a smooth rigid surface @xmath0 which fails stable rigidity very badly , the cylinder @xmath1 being essentially as remote as possible from a rigid variety in terms of richness of @xmath6-actions on it . here",
    "`` richness '' has to be interpreted in the sense of a slight weakening of the notion of flexibility introduced recently in @xcite that we call _ flexibility in codimension one _ : a normal affine variety @xmath2 is said to be flexible in codimension one if for every closed point @xmath14 outside a possibly empty closed subset of codimension two in @xmath2 , the tangent space @xmath15 of @xmath2 at @xmath14 is spanned by tangent vectors to orbits of @xmath6-actions on @xmath2 . clearly , the makar - limanov invariant of a variety with this property is trivial , consisting of constant functions only .",
    "now our main result can be stated as follows :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath16 be smooth cubic surface and let @xmath17 be a hyperplane section of @xmath18 consisting of the union of a smooth conic and its tangent line .",
    "then @xmath19 is a smooth rigid affine surface whose cylinder @xmath1 is flexible in codimension one .",
    "a noteworthy by - product is that while the automorphism group @xmath20 of @xmath0 is finite , actually isomorphic to @xmath21 if the cubic surface @xmath18 is chosen general , theorem 0.1 in @xcite implies that @xmath22 acts infinitely transitively on the complement of a closed subset of codimension at least two in @xmath1 .",
    "+ our construction is inspired by earlier work of bandman and makar - limanov @xcite which actually already contained the basic ingredients to construct a counter - example to stable rigidity , in the form of a lifting lemma for @xmath6-actions which asserts that if @xmath23 is a line bundle over a normal affine variety @xmath24 then @xmath25 , and an example of a non trivial line bundle @xmath26 over a smooth rational rigid affine surface @xmath27 for which @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , with these informations , the property that @xmath29 is a proper sub - algebra of @xmath30 could have been already deduced as follows : letting @xmath31 be a line bundle representing the class of the inverse of @xmath32 in the picard group of @xmath27 , the lifting lemma applied to the rank @xmath33 vector bundle @xmath34 considered as a line bundle over @xmath32 via the first projection implies that @xmath35 . but combined with a result of pavaman murthy @xcite which asserts in particular that every vector bundle on such a surface @xmath27 is isomorphic to the direct sum of its determinant and a trivial bundle , the construction of @xmath36 guarantees that it is isomorphic to the trivial bundle @xmath37 and hence that @xmath38 .",
    "+ noting that the aforementioned of pavaman murthy also applies to surfaces @xmath0 as in theorem [ thm : main ] , the same construction can be used for its proof provided that such an @xmath0 admits a line bundle @xmath39 whose total space is flexible in codimension one , and that flexibility in codimension one lifts to total spaces of line bundles .",
    "the lifting property follows easily from the fact that every line bundle admits @xmath6-linearizations , but the existence of a line bundle @xmath39 with the desired property is trickier to establish .",
    "to construct such a bundle , we exploit the fact that @xmath0 admits an @xmath4-fibration @xmath40 , i.e. a faithfully flat morphism with generic fiber isomorphic to affine line .",
    "the strategy then consists in constructing a suitable @xmath4-fibered affine surface @xmath41 flexible in codimension one and to which a variant of the famous danielewski fiber product trick @xcite can be applied to derive the existence of an affine threefold flexible in codimension one and carrying simultaneously the structure of a line bundle over @xmath0 and @xmath42 .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows . in the first section we review basic results about rigid and flexible affine varieties , with a particular focus on the case of affine surfaces , and we establish that flexibility in codimension one",
    "does indeed lift to total spaces of line bundles ( see lemma [ lem : flex - lift ] ) . section two is devoted to the study of the class of affine surfaces @xmath0 considered in theorem [ thm : main ] and the construction of their aforementioned flexible mates @xmath42 .",
    "the appropriate variant of the danielewski fiber product trick needed to achieve the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is discussed in the last section .",

    "we warn the reader that our definition of flexibility for a normal affine variety @xmath2 is weaker than the one introduced earlier in @xcite which asks in addition that @xmath63 .",
    "since for a @xmath53-flexible variety the set @xmath64 has codimension at least two in @xmath2 , this makes essentially no difference for global properties of @xmath2 depending on regular functions , for instance the makar - limanov invariant of a @xmath53-flexible affine variety is trivial .",

    "the fact that the rigid surfaces considered in theorem [ thm : main ] admit line bundles @xmath39 with @xmath53-flexible total spaces ( see  [ par : end_of_proof ] below ) shows that such total spaces can be in general very far from being rigid .      the total space of the trivial line bundle @xmath11 over a @xmath53-flexible ( resp .",
