    "ever since the pioneering work of totsuji & kihara ( 1969 ) and peebles ( 1974 ) , the two - point correlation function of galaxies has been one of the most fundamental tools in analyzing the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "recently , prominent advances in galaxy redshift surveys have been taking place ( for review , see strauss 1999 ) , and upcoming large - scale galaxy and qso surveys , notably the two - degree field survey ( 2df ; colless 1998 ; folkes 1999 ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; gunn & weinberg 1995 ; margon 1998 ) , will provide three - dimensional , large - scale redshift maps of galaxies and qso s .",
    "the two - point correlation function will play one of the central role in the analysis of such large - scale redshift maps .    in redshift surveys ,",
    "the distances to objects are measured by recession velocities , and thus the distribution of objects in redshift space is not identical to that in real space .",
    "the clustering pattern is distorted by peculiar velocity fields ( kaiser 1987 ) , and , for high redshift objects , also by cosmological warp of real space on a light - cone ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) . such effects are called as _ redshift distortions_.",
    "these effects on the linear power spectrum and on the linear two - point correlation function have been investigated by many authors ( for review , see hamilton 1998 )    most of the work is for redshift distortions in a nearby universe and assumes @xmath6 . kaiser ( 1987 ) , in his seminal paper , derived the linear redshift distortions of the power spectrum for a nearby universe , employing the distant - observer approximation , which assumes the scales of fluctuations of interest are much smaller than the distances to the objects .",
    "generally , the redshift distortions by peculiar velocities are along the line of sight .",
    "this radial nature of distortion introduces a statistical inhomogeneity into the redshift space . in the distant - observer approximation ,",
    "such inhomogeneity is neglected and the statistical homogeneity is recovered , while the anisotropy is introduced , instead .",
    "the fourier spectrum has maximal advantage when the statistical homogeneity does exist , thus , for this reason , kaiser s formula has a very simple form .",
    "hamilton ( 1992 ) transformed kaiser s formula of the power spectrum to the formula of the two - point correlation function , using the legendre expansion ( see also lilje & efstathiou 1989 ; mcgill 1990 ) .    despite the simple form of the formula , the distant - observer approximation is not desirable in the sense that we can not utilize the whole information of the survey within this approximation",
    "the wide - angle effect , which is the contribution of an angle @xmath0 between lines of sight of two objects to the correlation function , affects the analysis of the redshift maps when we intend to use the whole data of the survey .",
    "therefore , the analysis of wide - angle effect on the correlation function in linear theory ( hamilton & culhane 1996 ; zaroubi & hoffmann 1996 ; szalay , matsubara & landy 1998 ; bharadwaj 1999 ) , as well as the spherical harmonic analysis ( fisher , scharf & lahav 1994 ; heavens & taylor 1995 ) , are of great importance .",
    "all the above studies are for a nearby universe , and assume @xmath6 .",
    "this condition is not appropriate for modern galaxy redshift surveys ( @xmath7 ) or qso redshift surveys ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the evolution of clustering and the nonlinearity in the redshift - distance relation introduce _ the cosmological redshift distortion _ on the correlation function .",
    "ballinger , peacock & heavens ( 1996 ) and matsubara & suto ( 1996 ) explored this effect in power spectrum and correlation function , respectively , both employing the distant - observer approximation ( see also nakamura , matsubara & suto 1997 ; de laix & starkman 1997 ; popowski et al . 1998 ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999 ; nair 1999 ) .",
    "the more the depth of the redshift surveys is increasing , the more the cosmological redshift distortion becomes important .",
    "so far the previous formulas for two - point correlation function in redshift space are restricted either to nearby universe , or to distant - observer approximation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive the unified formula for the linear redshift distortions of the correlation function , fully taking into account the wide - angle effects and cosmological distortions , simultaneously . in this way",
    ", we do not have to think about which formula we should use depending on the value of @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the effects of the spatial curvature are also included in our formulation and our formula applies to friedman - lematre universe with arbitrary cosmological parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our formula turns out to correctly reproduce the known results if we take appropriate limits of the formula .    in ",
    "[ sec2 ] , the redshift - space distortions of density fluctuations toward radial directions are derived on a light - cone , which include the evolutionary effects . in  [ sec3 ] , the formula for correlation function in redshift space is derived separately for open , flat , and closed models .",
    "demonstrations of redshift distortions in several cases and the validity region of the conventional distant observer approximation are given in ",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  [ sec5 ] .",
    "throughout the present paper , we assume the friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as the background space - time of the universe . according to the sign of the spatial curvature @xmath10 ,",
    "the metric is given by @xmath11 ,        & ( k<0 ) \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle        a^2(t )        \\left [           d\\chi^2 + \\chi^2 ( d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2 )        \\right ] ,        & ( k=0 ) \\\\        \\displaystyle        \\frac{a^2(t)}{k }        \\left [           d\\chi^2 + \\sin^2\\chi(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2 )        \\right ] ,        & ( k>0 )     \\end{array}\\right . \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 and @xmath12 are usual angular coordinates , and @xmath13 is a radial comoving coordinate . in the following ,",
    "we choose a unit system , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the hubble s constant , so that comoving distances are measured in units of @xmath17 . in this unit system ,",
    "the spatial curvature @xmath10 is then given by @xmath18 where the scale factor at present is normalized as @xmath19 . from the flrw metric",
    ", we define the three dimensional metric @xmath20 as @xmath21 that is , the tensor @xmath20 is the metric for a three - space of uniform spatial curvature @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "vectors with latin indices represent the three - vector in the three - space specified by the metric @xmath20 .",
    "the comoving distance @xmath22 at redshift @xmath9 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hubble parameter at ( comoving ) redshift @xmath9 : @xmath25 the radial comoving coordinate @xmath13 and the comoving distance @xmath22 are related by @xmath26 provided that a cosmological model is fixed , the comoving distance @xmath13 , and the redshift @xmath9 are related through equation ( [ eq5 ] ) on the observable past light - cone , and we interchangeably use these variables in the following .",
    "therefore , we use the redshift @xmath9 as an alternative spatial coordinate . on a light cone surface ,",
    "it is also considered as an alternative of the time variable , @xmath27 .    in this paper , the light ray",
    "is assumed to be transmitted on an unperturbed metric for simplicity .",
    "this point is discussed later .",
    "then , in redshift space , the angular coordinates ( @xmath28 ) are common to those in real space .",
    "only the radial distances are distorted in redshift space .",
    "let us consider an object located at comoving coordinates @xmath29 which has the 4-velocity @xmath30 , normalized as @xmath31 as usual . in terms of the three - dimensional peculiar velocity @xmath32 ,",
    "this 4-velocity is given by @xmath33 the wave 4-vector , @xmath34 , satisfying the null geodesic equations , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a three dimensional normal vector , which represents the line of sight , and @xmath39 .",
    "the frequencies of the light at the source and at the observer are given by @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "assuming the peculiar velocities are non - relativistic , the redshift @xmath42 the observer actually observes is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the line - of - sight components of peculiar velocities of the source and of the observer .",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath46 is evaluated on a light cone , and @xmath47 can be estimated from the value of the dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation .    for convenience ,",
    "we define the redshift - space physical comoving distance as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is given by the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , and the function @xmath50 is formally the same as equation ( [ eq3 ] ) by definition .",
    "explicitly , @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 in other words , the redshift - space physical comoving distance @xmath53 defined by equation ( [ eq7.1 ] ) is the apparent physical comoving distance of an object in redshift space , which is originally at redshift @xmath9 in real space , and is shifted by its own peculiar velocity . in a limit @xmath54 , equation ( [ eq7.1 ] ) reduces to the usual relation for nearby universe ( kaiser 1987 ) , @xmath55 . from the redshift - space physical comoving distance @xmath53",
    ", we also define the redshift - space analog of comoving coordinate , @xmath56 as @xmath57 , or equivalently , @xmath58 the difference between the number density of observed objects in real space , @xmath59 and that in redshift space , @xmath60 , are related by the number conservation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is evaluated on a light cone . therefore , @xmath64 the number density in real space is given by the underlying number density of objects @xmath65 multiplied by the selection function @xmath66 : @xmath67 where we allow the direction dependence of the selection function .",
    "we assume the linear theory of density fluctuation throughout this paper and we only consider the first order in perturbation with respect to the variables , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath68 .",
    "then the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath13 for a fixed @xmath9 , equation ( [ eq7.1 ] ) becomes @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , for non - flat universe and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , for flat universe . with this expansion",
    ", the density contrast @xmath74 up to the first order is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the normalized time - dependent deceleration parameter , the time - dependent density parameter and the dimensionless cosmological term , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 is equal to the usual time - dependent deceleration parameter @xmath81 for flat universe , and @xmath82 times the usual deceleration parameter for non - flat universe .",
    "the light - cone effect of density contrast in redshift space is represented by this equation ( [ eq10.2 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that this equation is a generalization of corresponding formula derived by kaiser ( 1987 ) for @xmath83 .    in the above equations ,",
    "the light ray is assumed to be transmitted on an unperturbed metric . in reality",
    ", the frequency of the light is altered by the sachs - wolfe effect ( sachs & wolfe 1967 ) , and the path is bent by the gravitational lensing effect . the sachs - wolfe effect is the contribution of the potential fluctuations to the estimate of the redshift .",
    "the potential fluctuations are negligible except on scales comparable to the hubble distance , and in reality , observational determination of the fluctuations on hubble scales is not easy .",
    "therefore , the sachs - wolfe effect on the correlation function of density field is not supposed to be important in practice .",
    "the gravitational lensing changes the position on the sky of the observable objects .",
    "the weak lensing ( kaiser 1992 , 1998 ; bernardeau , waerbeke , & mellier 1997 ) is relevant in our linear analysis .",
    "the estimate of the number density is turn out to be affected by the local convergence of the gravitational lensing .",
    "the local convergence is given by the integration of the density fluctuations along the line of sight ( bernardeau et al .",
    "1997 ) , and it is efficient for @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the gravitational lensing affects the correlation function for @xmath84 . in which case , we should add a correction term to the equation ( [ eq10.2 ] ) .",
    "the quantitative estimate of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "the equations of motion relate the density contrast @xmath85 and the velocity field @xmath86 .",
    "since we intend to include the curvature effect , the newtonian equations of motion are not appropriate .",
    "instead , we employ the perturbed einstein equation , @xmath87 on a background flrw metric . in order to avoid the inclusion of spurious gauge modes in the solution , bardeen ( 1980 )",
    "introduced the gauge - invariant formalism for the above perturbed equation ( see also kodama & sasaki 1984 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; hwang & vishniac 1990 ) . in appendix a , we review the gauge - invariant formalism for the pressureless fluid , and derive complete equations to determine the evolution of the density contrast and the velocity field .",
    "they are given by equations ( [ eqgi11a])([eqgi11c ] ) : @xmath88 where a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the proper time , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the laplacian on the 3-metric , @xmath20 of the flrw metric , which is explicitly given in appendix b , equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the transverse part of the velocity field decays with time as @xmath91 and can be neglected , thus the velocity is characterized by the velocity potential @xmath92 so that the velocity is given by @xmath93 .",
    "the variables @xmath85 , @xmath92 , and @xmath66 in the above equations are actually gauge - invariant linear combinations defined in appendix a , and are guaranteed not to have spurious gauge mode in the solution .",
    "these variables correspond to density contrast , velocity potential , and gravitational potential inside the particle horizon . in general ,",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath94 correspond to the density contrast and velocity in velocity - orthogonal isotropic gauge , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , in the notation of appendix a. it is obvious that equations ( [ eq11a])([eq11c ] ) correspond to the continuity , euler , and poisson equations in newtonian linear theory .",
    "the only difference is the appearance of the curvature term in the laplacian .",
    "the curvature term would not be important in practice because the correlation function on curvature scales is too small to be practically detectable .",
    "however , we retain the curvature term for theoretical consistency in the following .",
    "eliminating the variables @xmath92 and @xmath66 from the equations , we obtain the evolution equation for the bardeen s gauge - invariant density contrast @xmath85 , given by @xmath97 this equation is equivalent to that in newtonian theory for the density contrast , and the solution of this equation is well - known ( peebles 1980 ) . the time dependence of the growing solution is given by @xmath98 in the following , we normalize this growing factor as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the present time .",
    "thus , the growing solution of the equation ( [ eq11.1 ] ) is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the mass density contrast at the present time .",
    "equation ( [ eq11a ] ) gives the solution of the velocity potential as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the hubble parameter at time @xmath27 .",
    "the inverse operator @xmath106 is evaluated by spectral decomposition in the next section .",
    "it turns out that the function @xmath107 depends only on @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and is approximately given by ( lahav et al .",
    "1991 ) @xmath110 from equation ( [ eq11.4 ] ) , @xmath111 since @xmath112 for non - flat universe and @xmath113 for flat universe , the above equation is equivalent to @xmath114 where @xmath115 .    equations ( [ eq10.2 ] ) and ( [ eq12.5 ] ) indicate the linear operator which transforms the density contrast at present in real space to that in redshift space on a light - cone .",
    "that is , we can define the redshift distortion operator : @xmath116 where @xmath117 the time - dependent redshift distortion parameter is defined by @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the time - dependent bias parameter . in the following ,",
    "we present the result in the case that there is neither stochasticity nor scale - dependence in the biasing .",
    "it is straightforward to include the scale - dependence and stochasticity , although the expression becomes more tedious . in linear regime , however , the stochasticity is shown to asymptotically vanish on large scales and biasing is scale - independent beyond the scale of galaxy formation , except some special cases ( matsubara 1999 ) .",
    "for the surveys of nearby universe , @xmath6 , the functions @xmath120 and @xmath107 do not vary as rapidly as the selection function , @xmath66 , and the factor @xmath121 in the above equations can be omitted , as is done in the literatures . however ,",
    "if the selection function varies as slowly as the factor @xmath121 , the latter factor can not be neglected . with the redshift distortion operator",
    ", we can re - express the density contrast in redshift space as @xmath122 this expression depends on a peculiar motion of observer , @xmath123 , which somewhat complicate the analysis . since we know the value @xmath123 by measuring the dipole anisotropy of the cmb radiation ( kogut et al .",
    "1993 ; lineweaver et al .",
    "1996 ) , we can subtract the term which depends on @xmath123 from the above expression . in the following",
    "we derive the correlation function in redshift space from the observer in the cmb frame and drop the @xmath123 term . in proper comparison of our result below and the observation , one should be sure that the correlation function is corrected by such kind of transformation to the cmb frame ( hamilton 1998 ) .",
    "the correlation function in redshift space of two points , @xmath124 , @xmath125 is thus given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath1 , @xmath2 are redshifts of the two points , and @xmath131 is the mass correlation function in real space at present time . the redshift distortion operators @xmath132 and @xmath133 operate the density contrast at points @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , and @xmath13 is a comoving separation of the two points .",
    "if we do not omit the local velocity term , @xmath123 , the square of the second term in equation ( [ eq15 ] ) is added to the equation ( [ eq16 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we obtain an explicit expression for equation ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we derive the explicit expression for the correlation function in redshift space .",
    "we separately consider an open universe , a flat universe and a closed universe in the following subsections .      in an open universe ( @xmath134 ) ,",
    "the correlation function in real space is given by equation ( [ eqa18ab ] ) : @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the power spectrum of the gauge - invariant density contrast ( see appendix b for detail ) is defined by bardeen s gauge - invariant density contrast , i.e. , the density contrast in a gauge with velocity - orthogonal slicing , @xmath95 . ] . in this subsection , we omit the superscript @xmath138 of @xmath139 , which distinguish the difference of functional forms according to the sign of curvature in appendix b. equation ( [ eq16 ] ) implies that we only need to calculate @xmath140 to obtain the formula for correlation function in redshift space . since the laplacian is the invariant operator under transformation of the coordinate system , the inverse operation @xmath141 , @xmath142 to @xmath143 is simply given by @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is defined by equation ( [ eqa3a ] ) , because @xmath143 is the fundamental eigenfunction of the laplacian [ appendix b , equation ( [ eqa2 ] ) ] .",
    "the calculationally nontrivial part of the redshift - space distortion operator is the spatial derivatives along the lines of sight , @xmath146 , which is not invariant operation , unlike the laplacian .",
    "we illustrate in the rest of this subsection how the calculation can be accomplished .",
    "the comoving separation @xmath13 between @xmath124 and @xmath125 is related to the comoving distances @xmath147 and @xmath148 of these two points from the observer and the angle , @xmath0 between the lines of sight of these points with respect to the observer ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , through the standard relation : @xmath149 the derivatives of this equation yield @xmath150 where @xmath151 is an angle between the geodesics of @xmath147 and @xmath13 , and @xmath152 is an angle between the geodesics of @xmath148 and @xmath13 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the following equations are useful for our purpose : @xmath153 where @xmath154 one can prove @xmath155 with this definition and @xmath156 for the scale much less than the curvature scale , @xmath157 .",
    "we also use the derivatives of the radial part of the harmonic function @xmath158 , given by equation ( [ eqa5a ] ) , and the recursion relation , given by equation ( [ eqa6a ] ) .",
    "the explicit form of the radial part of the harmonic function @xmath139 is presented in appendix b , equations ( [ eqa7a])([eqa11a ] ) .    after straightforward but somewhat tedious algebra , using equations ( [ eq19])([eq20.4 ] ) , ( [ eqa5a ] ) and ( [ eqa6a ] ) , one obtains the spatial derivatives along the lines of sight as @xmath159     x_2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\quad + \\ ,     \\frac{1}{21 }     \\left [        2 + 4\\cos^2{\\widetilde{\\theta}}-        3\\left(\\cos^2\\gamma_1 + \\cos^2\\gamma_2\\right ) +        12\\cos\\gamma_1\\cos\\gamma_2\\cos{\\widetilde{\\theta}}\\right ]     ( \\nu^2 + 4 ) x_2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\quad + \\ ,     \\frac{1}{35 }     \\left [        1 + 2\\cos^2{\\widetilde{\\theta}}-        5\\left(\\cos^2\\gamma_1 + \\cos^2\\gamma_2\\right ) +        20\\cos\\gamma_1\\cos\\gamma_2\\cos{\\widetilde{\\theta}}\\right .",

    "the extent of the elongation for std and open models are similar , but the elongation for flat model is smaller than other models .",

    "the hamilton s formula ( thin lines ) is valid when the separation @xmath269 is not so large .",
    "the reason why the hamilton s formula deviate even in small angles is that when the angle is small enough , the redshift becomes large , and the evolutionary and geometrical effects are not negligible .",

    "in addition , the precise form of the selection function is practically difficult to determine . if the luminocities and/or the surface brightnesses are correlated to density fluctuations , it can mimick the large - scale structure",

    "each quantity has different effects on the correlation function in redshift space .",
    "roughly speaking , the cosmological parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 mostly affect the distortions of the contour of the correlation function , the power spectrum @xmath282 mostly affects the profile of the correlation function , and the bias evolution mostly affects the z - dependence of the amplitude .",
    "since all the pairs of the objects in the redshift survey can be used , we can expect that those quantities are determined with small errors by performing proper likelihood analysis , such as the karhunen - love mode decomposition ( vogeley & szalay 1996 ; matsubara , szalay & landy 1999 ) .",
