    "vincent moncrief and i became interested in spatially inhomogeneous cosmological spacetimes as graduate students at the university of maryland more than 30 years ago .",

    ", gowdy had recognized that essentially interchanging the radial and time coordinates in the einstein - rosen solution yielded cosmological spacetimes containing gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "moncrief and i had many discussions about the gowdy models  especially those with @xmath2 spatial topology .",
    "the classical and quantum mechanical properties of the polarized subclass of gowdy @xmath2 models eventually became my thesis @xcite .",
    "even then , we recognized that gowdy spacetimes are ideal  theoretical laboratories \" to test formalisms to develop potentially provable conjectures .",
    "later work by a number of authors , e.g.  @xcite , has demonstrated the usefulness of these models .",
    "both moncrief and i returned to the gowdy models from time to time , e.g.  as an example of extendable spacetimes @xcite or quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "our paths and the gowdy models crossed again in 1993 at ( k)itp when we used generic gowdy @xmath2 spacetimes in the collapsing direction to investigate the approach to the singularity with numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "this project grew to involve others ( for a summary see @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ) and explored a variety of collapsing spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies . in this chapter",
    ", i will discuss one aspect of my collaboration with moncrief  the signature of local mixmaster dynamics ( lmd ) ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the singularity theorems of penrose , hawking , and others state that reasonable matter evolving from regular , generic initial data will develop singular or otherwise pathological behavior if the gravitational field becomes sufficiently strong .",
    "the theorems do not , however , describe the nature of these inevitable singularities .",
    "penrose s cosmic censorship conjectures state that the singularities must be hidden from external observers by an event horizon ( weak ) and/or not be detectable by a timelike observer until he / she falls into it ( strong ) .",
    "specific spacetimes are known with many different types of singular behavior .",
    "some yield violations of the cosmic censorship conjectures but are for various reasons viewed as non - generic . collapsing spatially inhomogeneous cosmological spacetimes provide an arena for exploring the nature of generic singularities and for testing strong cosmic censorship . an excellent review of singularities and cosmic censorship along with references to the original papers may be found in @xcite .",
    "long ago , belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite had argued that the generic singularity was spacelike , local , and oscillatory .",
    "this means that , eventually , in a generic gravitational collapse , each spatial point will evolve as a separate universe .",
    "the time evolution at that point will then describe the approach to the singularity of the most general spatially homogeneous cosmology  bianchi type ix ( or viii )  the mixmaster model @xcite .",
    "mixmaster behavior has been a focus of study for almost 40 years ( for a review see @xcite ) . at any instant , the state of a collapsing mixmaster universe",
    "may be described by a single ( bkl ) parameter @xmath3 which encodes the anisotropic collapse rates of the spacetime .",
    "each epoch of the collapse is a kasner spacetime characterized by a fixed ( in time ) value of @xmath3 . as bkl argued , this fixed value can not be maintained as the influence of the spatial scalar curvature in a generic spacetime begins to dominate .",
    "the change in @xmath3 is calculated using conservation of momentum in a bounce off the dominant term in the curvature potential @xcite .",
    "it is found that , for @xmath4 , the value of @xmath3 at the @xmath5 epoch is given by @xmath6 a combination of numerical simulation @xcite and mathematical analysis @xcite has demonstrated that the asymptotic dynamics approaches arbitrarily close to that described by the @xmath3-map ( [ ueq ] ) . note that the sequence @xmath7 is sensitive to initial conditions ( due to the subtraction in the denominator ) .",
    "all the epochs with @xmath8 form an era . when @xmath9 , a new era begins .",
    "the era - to - era evolution of @xmath3 is described by the gauss map @xmath10)^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath11 $ ] denotes integer part .",
    "the simple relationship of the @xmath3-map offers , as was known to bkl , an invariant way to characterize mixmaster dynamics at any spatial point ( local mixmaster dynamics ( lmd ) ) .",
    "bkl referred to lmd as oscillatory behavior .",
    "the other primary type of approach to the singularity in spatially homogeneous cosmologies is exemplified by the existence of a final kasner ( or bianchi type i ) epoch ( or @xmath3-value ) .",
    "this behavior is called asymptotic velocity term dominance ( avtd ) since , once in the final kasner epoch , the spatial scalar curvature never again plays a role in the dynamics .",
    "the bkl conjecture is that ( 1 ) eventually all singularities will be spacelike , ( 2 ) each spatial point evolves as a separate spatially homogeneous universe , and ( 3 ) while the most general behavior is lmd , some systems will be avtd .    in the past few years , progress has been made in providing a rigorous underpinning to the identification of spacetimes with avtd approaches to the singularity @xcite .",
    "for example , andersson and rendall were able to prove the existence of an open set of avtd solutions for cosmological spacetimes on @xmath12 with no symmetries and a scalar field ( to suppress lmd ) @xcite .",
    "analogous constructions for spatially inhomogeneous cosmological spacetimes expected to exhibit lmd do not yet exist .",
    "( see , however , uggla et al @xcite ) .",
    "so far , the only detailed knowledge of the approach to the singularity in such models come from numerical simulations @xcite . numerical simulations of @xmath12 spacetimes without symmetry are in progress @xcite .",
    "these use invariant quantities equivalent to a local construction of the @xmath3-map to search for lmd . an invariant calculation of a quantity equivalent to @xmath3 will yield a prediction for the next value of @xmath3 at that spatial point .",
    "while this approach has been tested in spacetimes of higher symmetry and preliminary results show its value in the most general case @xcite , i shall focus here on another way to characterize lmd that has proven useful in these models @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of gowdy @xcite , @xmath1-symmetric @xcite , and @xmath0-symmetric spacetimes have used ( in contrast to the no - symmetry case ) variables adapted to the system in question . a hamiltonian whose variation yields the relevant einstein equations may be developed in terms of these variables and their conjugate momenta .",
    "the variables are chosen so that the hamiltonian ( density ) , @xmath13 , has the form of a kinetic  energy \" plus a potential  energy . \"",
    "some of the terms in @xmath13 depend exponentially on the configuration variables .",
    "these , as well as non - exponential terms , may contain spatial derivatives . neglecting both the exponential and spatial derivative terms",
    "typically yields a ",
    "free particle \" hamiltonian .",
    "the solution to the corresponding equations of motion would describe the model s velocity term dominated ( vtd ) limit ( if it were to exist ) .",
    "a heuristic argument that the model is avtd would be that substitution of the vtd solution into the neglected terms causes them to become exponentially small as the singularity is approached .",
    "if the vtd solution is not consistent in this way , one typically finds two or more of the exponential potentials alternately growing and decaying .",
    "this yields the ( presumably ) infinite sequence of bounces that characterizes lmd .",
    "this heuristic approach , called the method of consistent potentials ( mcp ) , was first introduced by grubisi and moncrief @xcite and later generalized @xcite .    following the mcp approach",
    ", it was found that apparently different classes of potentials were important in the various non - avtd models .",
    "most strikingly , the mixmaster dynamics involving the standard three minisuperspace potential terms in the spatially homogeneous models somehow become bounces off two potentials in @xmath0-symmetric collapse and three again in generic @xmath1-symmetric collapse . to resolve this",
    " paradox , \" one can rewrite the metric of a bianchi type ix cosmology in the same variables as those of a spatially inhomogeneous model and thus identify the signature for mixmaster dyanamics in these variables @xcite .",
    "we note that , while we shall focus primarily on @xmath2 spatial topology , the bianchi type ix as @xmath0-connection is , of course , made for @xmath14 spatial topology .",
    "heuristic evidence is that close to the singularity , as the influence of nearby spatial points on the dynamics at any given one becomes negligible , topological differences also become unimportant .",
    "this may be demonstrated explicitly through comparison of the approach to the singularity of gowdy models on @xmath12 @xcite with those on @xmath15 @xcite .    in this chapter",
    ", i shall summarize the ( published ) predictions of lmd in @xmath0-symmetric models and report on some tests of these predictions .",
    "i shall then discuss the closely related issue of expressing a @xmath1-symmetric spacetime as a @xmath0-symmetric one .",
    "this allows similar predictions to be made from observations in @xmath1-symmetric spacetimes @xcite .",

    "the gowdy areal time choice is then comparable to the volumetric gauge condition ( [ arealgauge ] ) .",
    "( note that in @xcite it is shown that writing ( polarized ) gowdy models as inhomogeneous generalizations of bianchi i cosmologies in misner s minisuperspace variables requires a rotation such that @xmath198 so that the gowdy spacetime equivalent of ( [ wdot ] ) will be @xmath199 . )",
    "since @xmath160 is constant in the gowdy spacetime , the areal time choice is compatible with the bkl gauge condition .",
    "once we consider generalized @xmath1-spacetimes , the bkl gauge condition is no longer compatible and we must use the areal gauge condition ( [ ndef ] ) which is the appropriate analog of ( [ arealgauge ] ) .    to better search for twist bounces in @xmath0 models ,",
    "we replace the gauge condition @xmath200 with @xmath201 as an analog of ( [ arealgauge ] ) .",
    "shows a possible twist bounce in such a simulation although one can not regard the evidence to be compelling .",
    "the required signature is present although at a barely detectable scale .",
    "nonetheless , we may argue that this approach of defining signatures of lmd in simpler models has proven ( and will prove ) useful .",
    "future work consists of more careful analysis of improved @xmath0 simulations as well as the development of a direct connection between non - diagonal bianchi ix @xcite and @xmath1-symmetric models .",
    "discussion in @xcite indicates that the lmd seen in @xmath1-symmetric models can be understood as requiring a bounce off a rotational potential wall .",
    "such a wall requires generalization of the metric in ( [ metricix ] ) and @xcite to include non - diagonal metric components for the metric expressed in spatial 1-forms .",
    "the need for the new gauge condition and the need for a more general mixmaster model may imply that the @xmath0 metric used in @xcite should be generalized .",
    "the search for lmd signatures can provide heuristic evidence for or against the generality of these simulations .",
