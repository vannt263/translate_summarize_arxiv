    "hypernuclear physics adds another flavor ( strangeness ) to the traditional nuclear physics , and its goal is to study the behavior of hyperons ( @xmath17 in the nuclear environments , which are now bound system of neutrons , protons and one or more hyperons .",
    "interesting strange nuclei with strangeness @xmath18 are the @xmath0 hypernuclei , in which a @xmath0 hyperon , having a mass of @xmath19 mev and zero charge and isospin , replaces one of the nucleons .",
    "same as the free @xmath0 hyperon , they are mostly produced via the strong interactions , in the reaction processes @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , by making use of the pion ( @xmath23 ) and kaon ( @xmath24 ) beams .",
    "they also basically decay through the weak interactions , as the free @xmath0 does . yet , as it is well known and explained below , there are some very important differences in the corresponding decaying modes .    first , it should be remembered that the free @xmath0 hyperon decays nearly @xmath25 % of the time by the @xmath26 weak - mesonic mode ( fig .",
    "1 ) :    . [ fig1 ] ]    \\ {    ccc p+^- & & ( 64.1% ) + n+^0 & & ( 35.7% ) ,    . with the total transition rate @xmath27 ev ( which corresponds to the lifetime @xmath28 sec ) . for the decay at rest",
    "the energy - momentum conservation implies m_=m_n++ ;  p_n&&p_. therefore the energy released is q_0=m_-m_n - m_37   , and the kinetic energies and momenta in the final state are : t_n&=&5   ;  t_=q_0-t_n32   , + p_n&&p_=100   /c .",
    "it is clear that the isospin is changed by @xmath29 and @xmath30 and its projection by @xmath31 in the free @xmath26 decay .",
    "more , as    @xmath32 : & & = + +    @xmath33 : & & = -+ , + one sees that the above experimental data can be accounted for fairly well by neglecting the @xmath34 components in these relations ( @xmath29 rule ) . in fact , one gets @xmath35 , while the experimental result is @xmath36 .    assuming the @xmath29 rule , the phenomelogical weak hamiltonian for the process depicted in fig .",
    "1 can be expressed as : ^w_n&=&-ig_fm_^2_n(a_+b__5 ) _ _ , [ 1.1]where @xmath37 is the weak coupling constant .",
    "the empirical constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 , adjusted to the observables of the free @xmath0 decay , determine the strengths of parity violating and parity conserving amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the nucleon , @xmath0 and pion fields are given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , while the isospin spurion @xmath43 is included in order to enforce the empirical @xmath44 rule .",
    "( note that : @xmath45 ) .",
    "the free @xmath0 hyperon weak decay is radically modified in the nuclear environment because the nucleon and the hyperon now move , respectively , in the mean fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which come from the @xmath48 and @xmath49 interactions . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are characterized by the single particle energies ( s.p.e . ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 and we have to differentiate between : 1 . _ mesonic decay ( md ) _ : the basic process is again represented by the graph shown in fig . 1 and described by the hamiltonian .",
    "yet , the energy - momentum conservation is different : m_=m_n-_+_n^++ ;  _ a&=&-_where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the mass and the momentum of the whole nucleus ; @xmath54 is the mass number , and @xmath55 are the s.p.e . of the loosely bound states above the fermi energy @xmath56 .",
    "they are of the order of a few mev , while @xmath51 is the energy of the @xmath57 state and goes from @xmath58  mev for @xmath59 to @xmath60  mev for @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "thus , the corresponding q - values q_m",
    "= m_-m_n - m_+_-_n^ , are significantly smaller than @xmath62 , particularly for medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "the experimental decay rates @xmath63 ) are of the order of @xmath64 only for nuclei with @xmath65 , and they rapidly fall as a function of nuclear mass . for instance , in @xmath11 : @xmath66 and @xmath67 . this hindrance effect , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 for the hypernucleus @xmath13 , is due to pauli principle .",
    "in fact , the population of states that are below the fermi level , with energies @xmath68 , is totally blocked by the pauli principle , while transitions to states that lie above @xmath56 are strongly hindered due to the selection rule @xmath69n@xmath70 , n being the harmonic oscillator quantum numbers .",
    "that is , only a few second forbidden transitions ( @xmath69n@xmath71 ) can occur in the case of @xmath13 , and it is clear that the degree of forbiddiness increases with @xmath54 .    : the population of occupied states @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are below the fermi level @xmath74 , is totally blocked by the pauli principle , while transitions to the weakly bound empty states @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which lie above @xmath56 , are strongly hindered by the selection rule @xmath69n@xmath70.[fig2 ] ]    \\2 .",
    "_ nonmesonic decay _ : new nonmesonic decay ( nmd ) channels @xmath77 become open inside the nucleus , where there are no pions in the final state .",
    "the corresponding transition rates can be stimulated either by protons , @xmath78 , or by neutrons , @xmath79 .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation and the q - value are , respectively : m_&=&m_n-_-_n^+++ ;  _ a=-_1-_2 , and q_nm = m_-m_n+_+_n^ , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the momenta of the two outgoing nucleons .",
    "as the mean value of @xmath82 is @xmath83 mev one gets that @xmath84 mev , which is basically the kinetic energy of the two particles that are ejected from the hypernucleus .",
    "this means that the nonnesonic decay process possesses a large phase space in the continuum , as is outlined in fig . 2 for the case of the hypernucleus @xmath13 .",
    "the theoretical models reproduce fairly well the experimental values of the total width @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) but the ratio @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) remains a puzzle .",
    ": the hyperon @xmath0 and one of the nucleons from the occupied states @xmath72 and @xmath73 are expelled into the large phase space in the continuum , becoming free nucleons with momenta @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    very often it is assumed that the hypernuclear nmd @xmath77 is triggered via the exchange of a virtual meson , and the obvious candidate is the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) mechanism , where the strong hamiltonian ^s_n n&=&ig_nn|_n_5_n , [ 1.2](with @xmath89 ) accompanies the weak hamiltonian . following the pioneering investigations of adams @xcite several calculations have been done within this coupling scheme yielding : @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the importance of the @xmath92 meson in the weak decay mechanism was first discussed by mckellar and gibson @xcite , and the present - day consensus is , however , that the effect of the @xmath92-meson on both @xmath93 and @xmath94 is small @xcite . the full one meson - exchange model ( omem ) , which encompasses all pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath95 ) and all vector mesons ( @xmath96 ) , has been also considered by several authors @xcite . from these works",
    "we have learned that , although the @xmath24 meson contribution significantly increases the ratio @xmath94 , the omem is unable to account for the corresponding experimental values .    .",
    "in the one meson exchange model a weak vertex @xmath97 is always combined with a strong vertex @xmath98 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    we wish to restate that the omem transition potential is purely phenomenological and that it is not derived from a fundamental underlying form , as happens for instance , in the case of electro - magnetic transitions or the semileptonic weak decays .",
    "as in the case of the ope , in the omem , a weak baryon - baryon - meson ( bbm ) coupling is always combined with a strong bbm coupling ( see fig .",
    "the strong one is determined experimentally with some help from the su(3 ) symmetry , and the involving uncertainties have been copiously discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is the weak bbm couplings which could become the largest source of errors .",
    "in fact , only the weak @xmath99 amplitude can be taken from the experiment , at the expense of neglecting the off - mass - shell corrections .",
    "all other weak bbm couplings are derived theoretically by using @xmath100 and @xmath101 symmetries , octet dominance , current algebra , pcac , pole dominance , .",
    "assortments of such methods have been developed and employed for a long time in weak interaction physics to explain the hyperon nonleptonic decays .",
    "one should also keep in mind that both the strong and weak bbm couplings , as well the meson masses , can become significantly renormalized by the nuclear environment @xcite .",
    "the nuclear structure frameworks utilized in the literature for the formal derivations of the nmd rates are : i ) the nuclear matter , and ii ) the nuclear shell model .",
    "there are relatively few works where the second method was employed , and up to quite recently all they were involved the technique of coefficients of fractional parentage , with the spectroscopic factors ( sf ) explicitly appearing in the expressions for the transition rates @xcite . at variance ,",
    "barbero @xcite have developed a fully general shell model formalism and have specified it for hypernuclei with odd - mass core , such as @xmath102 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath14 , were the cores are : @xmath6 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . here",
    "we also discuss the hypernuclei with even - even and odd - odd number of protons and neutrons , namely @xmath9 and @xmath13 , and @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the shell model framework for the nmd rates has been developed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we will just sketch the main steps , employing the same notation .",
    "one starts from fermi s golden rule for the decay rate , & = & 2_sm_sj_fm_ftm_t | v|^2 + & & ( _ p_1+_p_2+_f -_i ) , [ 2.1]where @xmath108 is the weak hypernuclear potential , and the wave functions for the kets @xmath109 and @xmath110 are assumed to be antisymmetrized and normalized . after performing : 1 ) the transformation to the relative and center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "momenta , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and angular momenta @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and 2 ) the angular momentum couplings : @xmath115 , @xmath116 one obtains : _",

    "thus , that the nmd rates , in principle , depend on both : i ) the nuclear structure effects through the two - particle @xmath49 parentage coefficients @xmath125 , and on the transition potential via the elementary transition amplitudes ( ppllsjt;j_j_n , t_n)&= & + & & ( ppllsj;tm_t = t_+t_n|v|j_j_nj;t_t_n ) .",

    "the explicit expressions for the transition potentials are given in the ref .",

    "correspondingly , the state @xmath136 goes into @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where @xmath137 is the bcs vacuum and @xmath140 is the quasiparticle creation operator @xcite .",

    "the shell model formalism for the nonmesonic weak decay of the hypernuclei involves a partial wave expansion of the emitted nucleon waves and preserves naturally the antisymmetrization between the escaping particles and the residual core .",
    "the general expression is valid for any nuclear model and it shows that the nonmesonic transition rates should depend , in principle , on both : ( i ) the weak transition potential , through the elementary transition amplitudes @xmath163 , and ( ii ) the nuclear structure , through the two - particle @xmath49 parentage coefficients @xmath164 .",
    "the latter explicitly depend on the initial and final wave functions . yet , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and because of : a ) the inclusive nature of the nonmesonic decay , and b ) the peculiar properties of the coefficients @xmath141 , this dependence is washed out . in this way we have arrived at a very simple result for transition rates , given by the eq . , which is valid , not only for the hypernuclei with odd - even core ( as shown previously @xcite ) , but also for those which have even - even and odd - odd cores , which has been demonstrated here .",

    "<S> it is shown that in all three cases the nuclear structure manifests itself basically through pauli principle , and very simple expressions are derived for the neutron and proton induced decays rates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which does not involve the spectroscopic factors . for the strangeness - changing weak @xmath4 transition potential </S>",
    "<S> we use the one - meson - exchange model ( omem ) , which comprises the exchange of the complete pseudoscalar and vector meson octets ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9,@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 hypernuclei , with commonly used parametrization for the omem , and compare the results with the available experimental information . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated rates @xmath15 are consistent with the data , but the measurements of @xmath16 are not well accounted for by the theory . it is suggested that , unless additional degrees of freedom are incorporated , the omem parameters should be radically modified .    </S>",
