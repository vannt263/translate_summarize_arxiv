    "reconstruction in cosmology considers the following problem : one assumes that the present spatial distribution of masses ( galaxies and clusters , including their dark - matter components ) is known from observations , and one wants to reconstruct the dynamical history of the universe all the way to the earliest epoch , when matter and radiation decoupled ( nearly 14 billion years ago ) .",
    "peebles @xcite introduced the reconstruction problem , and proposed a variational formulation for solving it on a relatively small spatial scale , that of the local group ( which includes our own galaxy and neighboring ones ) . on scales",
    "much larger than that of the local group , which have been mapped in recent years through various projects such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , reconstruction may be posed in the simplest cases as an instance of optimal mass transport . indeed , frisch et al .",
    "@xcite showed that when the _ zeldovich approximation _ @xcite or a refinement thereof ( cf .",
    "below ) are applied to the relevant cosmological fluid equations , the correspondence between the positions of mass elements initially ( at decoupling ) and finally ( at the present epoch ) is the solution to an optimal mass transport problem with quadratic cost . this solution is uniquely prescribed by the _ marginals _ : the mass distribution at decoupling ( essentially uniform ) and its highly non - uniform present distribution .",
    "a striking feature is that the sole knowledge of the current positions of galaxies , without knowledge of their ( proper ) velocities , yields nevertheless a unique solution for this kind of large - scale reconstruction .",
    "it was then shown by brenier et al . and by loeper @xcite that , with prescribed marginals , unique reconstruction , not only of the lagrangian map , but of the full dynamical history of matter elements , carries over to the euler  poisson model , whose validity extends much beyond that of the zeldovich approximation .",
    "its unique solution is again obtained from an optimal transport problem with a convex cost function , expressible as a space - time integral of a suitable action , a problem whose numerical resolution remains a challenge .",
    "as is well known , the mass transport problem was introduced by monge @xcite more than two hundred years ago , and the theory took its modern shape after the 1942 work of kantorovich @xcite ( see , e.g. , villani @xcite for review ) .",
    "the zeldovich approximation @xcite was introduced in 1970 as a first formulation in terms of lagrangian coordinates of the growth of density perturbations .",
    "it replaces the full euler  poisson equations by basically the three - dimensional inviscid burgers equation ( written here in standard fluid dynamical notation ) @xmath2 the validity of the zeldovich approximation is controlled by how close one is to decoupling , but in a scale - dependent way : at very large scales , the zeldovich approximation remains valid up to the present epoch ; at very small scales , the formation of multi - stream caustics quickly ruins not only the validity of the zeldovich approximation , but even that of the euler  poisson model .",
    "an immediate consequence of is that the velocity of any fluid particle remains constant in the course of time and that the trajectories are straight lines .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the initial ( lagrangian ) fluid particle positions and by @xmath4 their ( eulerian ) positions at the current epoch @xmath5 . the lagrangian map associated with the zeldovich approximation is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the initial velocity potential . for sufficiently small @xmath8 and a sufficiently smooth initial potential ,",
    "the lagrangian map is thus the gradient of a convex function , a property shared by the next - order approximation , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : cosmo ] .",
    "this is why reconstruction is linked to optimal transport ; indeed , a theorem of brenier @xcite states that the solution to the monge optimal transport problem with quadratic cost is a gradient of a convex function , which satisfies a monge  ampre equation .",
    "the method of cosmological reconstruction in which one assumes that the lagrangian map has a convex potential and then numerically solves a quadratic - cost optimal transport problem ( after suitable discretization ) is called the monge  ampre",
    " kantorovich ( mak ) method @xcite .",
    "the zeldovich approximation gives us some insight into the full temporal history of mass elements .",
    "an important consequence of is that for any the mapping of particle positions at time @xmath0 to their positions at time @xmath9 is also a gradient of a convex function .",
    "when the flow - induced mapping between any two times is potential , the flow is here called _",
    "omni - potential_. as we shall see , the velocity field associated with such flows has the property of being simultaneously potential in eulerian coordinates ( in cosmology , this constraint stems from the potential character of gravity and the expansion of the universe ) , as well as in lagrangian coordinates ( which allows reconstruction by solving an optimal transport problem ) .",
    "we are of course led to ask whether there exist omni - potential flows other than zeldovich / burgers ones or trivial variants thereof . investigating this issue is the central topic of our paper .    in section  [ s : geometry ]",
    "we show that omni - potentiality can be reexpressed geometrically and algebraically in terms of hessian matrices and recast as a set of one or several partial differential equations ( depending on the space dimension ) . in section",
    "[ s : algebra ] we use an algebraic method to construct explicit non - trivial examples of omni - potential flows in two and three dimensions .",
    "these are rather special and we are led to ask how general are omni - potential flows . in section  [ s : wkb ]",
    "we construct a fairly general class of two - dimensional omni - potential flows , leaving the problem open in higher dimensions . in section",
    "[ s : cosmo ] we return to questions of cosmological relevance : to what extent are the full solutions to the cosmological equations omni - potential ?",

    "[ s : conclusion ] we list some open problems and make concluding remarks .",

    "in the present paper we study the kinematics of omni - potential flows .",
    "we start by recalling the basic definitions of the lagrangian and eulerian description of a flow  a  motion of fluid regarded as a continuum of infinitesimal fluid particles ( whose mathematical abstraction is a _ point _ particle ) .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the velocity of the fluid measured at point @xmath4 in space and at time @xmath11 .",
    "it is usually called the _ eulerian velocity _ ( the velocity measured at a fixed position in the laboratory frame ) .",
    "the motion of a fluid particle satisfies the ordinary differential equation @xmath12 which has to be supplemented by the initial condition @xmath13 if the velocity field @xmath10 is prescribed and sufficiently regular , one can solve this initial value problem , at least locally in time , and obtain the mapping @xmath14 called the _",
    "lagrangian map_. it takes a particle at the lagrangian position @xmath3 and carries it to the eulerian position @xmath4 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath3 , the curve @xmath15 , parameterized by varying time @xmath11 , is the _ trajectory of the particle _ , whose lagrangian position is @xmath3 .",
    "when , in a field associated with the flow , we perform the substitution @xmath16 , we obtain its lagrangian description , in which the field is now a function of the lagrangian coordinates @xmath3 . for instance",
    ", @xmath17 is called the _",
    "lagrangian velocity_.    in this paper , we consider flows @xmath10 defined , for simplicity , in the entire space @xmath18 , but restricted to a finite time interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the flow induces a set of mappings of space : given two arbitrary times @xmath11 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 , the mapping from fluid particle positions at time @xmath11 to their positions at time @xmath20 is here called the @xmath22-mapping .",
    "the @xmath23-mapping is just the standard lagrangian map .    as stated in the introduction , for any two times @xmath11 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 , the @xmath22-mappings induced by _ omni - potential _ flows are required to be the gradients of a convex potential @xmath24 : @xmath25 such a mapping is here called potential and @xmath24 is called the @xmath22-potential .",
    "given any three times @xmath26 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 such that @xmath27 , the @xmath28-mapping composed with the @xmath22-mapping obviously yields the @xmath29-mapping .",
    "this semigroup associativity , combined with omni - potentiality , implies @xmath30 which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] .    differentiation of with respect to time @xmath20 shows that the velocity , @xmath31 , is also potential : @xmath32 where @xmath33 in this notation , @xmath34 is the lagrangian velocity of a fluid particle , while its eulerian velocity is @xmath35 ; thus , in omni - potential flow , the velocity is potential in both eulerian and lagrangian coordinates . in three dimensions ,",
    "this is equivalent , locally , to the statement that the vorticity ( the curl of the velocity ) vanishes in both coordinate systems .",
    "we shall call this dual potentiality in both eulerian and lagrangian coordinates _",
    "bi - potentiality_.        we demand that all @xmath22-potentials of omni - potential flows be convex in the space variables .",
    "this implies that the associated @xmath22-mappings have inverses that are also potential , the potentials associated with the inverse mappings being the legendre transforms of those of the direct mappings ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , appendix  c and references therein ) .",
    "actually , for a sufficiently smooth flow , the converse is true : invertibility implies convexity of the maps , as now explained .",
    "let us denote by @xmath36 the hessian of a ( twice differentiable ) function @xmath37 , i.e. , the @xmath38 matrix with the entries @xmath39 we now assume that the potentials are twice differentiable in the space variables and that their hessians @xmath40 depend continuously on their time arguments .",
    "we then observe that , for coinciding times , the @xmath41-mapping is the identity mapping , clearly having the convex potential @xmath42 whose hessian is the identity . as the two times separate , loss of convexity would require one or several eigenvalues of the hessian to change sign and thus to go through zero ; at such an instant , the jacobian matrix ( which for a potential mapping coincides with the hessian of the potential ) becomes degenerate ; then , generically , the inverse mapping ceases to exist , i.e. , the property of the @xmath22-mapping to be bijective gets lost ( in the cosmological context this amounts to _ shell crossing _ leading to _ multi - streaming _ ) .",
    "below , we establish criteria for omni - potentiality . in sec .  [",

    "[ sub : app1 ] we present an equivalent condition for the commutativity of hessians : along any trajectory , at any time @xmath11 , the hessian @xmath43 and its time derivative should commute ; this is used to show that omni - potentiality is equivalent to potentiality of both the lagrangian and the eulerian flow velocities ( plus the convexity constraints ) . in sec .",
    "[ sub : linea ] we discuss simple examples of omni - potentiality : zeldovich and zeldovich - type flows . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sub : eqn2d ] we derive a partial differential equation for the potential of a two - dimensional omni - potential flow .",
    "it states that a suitable expression constructed from second - order derivatives depends only on the lagrangian coordinates , but not on time .",
    "in other words , the hessian of the potential possesses an _",
    "invariant _ , whose value depends only on the trajectory .",
    "we construct similar invariants in higher - dimensional spaces in the appendix .",
    "the semigroup associativity involves the composition of two potential maps .",
    "we shall show that , in general , such a composition is potential if and only if the hessians commute .",
    "basically this stems from the well - known theorem that the product of two symmetric matrices is symmetric only when they commute .",
    "the problem we are now addressing is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , which sketches the action of three mappings along the same trajectory .",
    "we observe that the @xmath22-mapping is the composition of the inverse of the @xmath28-mapping with the @xmath29-mapping .",
    "we shall now show that its potentiality is equivalent to the commutation of the hessians of the @xmath28-mapping and of the @xmath29-mapping .",
    "specifically , we assume that , for any times @xmath11 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath44 , the @xmath22-mapping of @xmath18 into itself is a bijection that , together with its inverse , is smooth ( i.e. , has as many continuous derivatives , as we might need ) .",
    "we denote @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the potentials of the @xmath28-mapping and the @xmath29-mapping , respectively .",
    "the required potentiality of the @xmath22-mapping implies that the jacobian matrix @xmath48 is symmetric : @xmath49 for any pair of indices @xmath50 .",
    "the converse is also true , at least locally in space . by the chain rule , @xmath51 therefore , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the matrix inverse to @xmath54 . for the r.h.s .  of to be a symmetric matrix , the matrices @xmath55 and @xmath53 must commute , which is equivalent to the commutation of the two hessians @xmath55 and @xmath54 .    reversing the arguments , we establish that commutation of hessians @xmath46 along a trajectory , @xmath56 at any times @xmath11 and @xmath20 is _ necessary _ for the mapping @xmath57 to be potential .",
    "in particular , commutation of hessians of the potential @xmath58 of the lagrangian map along each trajectory ( for each fixed @xmath3 ) , together with invertibility or convexity , is equivalent to omni - potentiality .    by the theorem on codiagonalizability of commuting ( real ) symmetric matrices ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , pp .",
    "5051 ) the equivalent condition is that the hessians of the potential @xmath46 calculated at different times @xmath11 for the same coordinate @xmath3 and the same @xmath26 are _ codiagonalizable _ , i.e. , can be transformed into the diagonal form using the same unitary matrix . in other words , along any trajectory , only the eigenvalues of the hessian of the potential but not the eigendirections are allowed to vary .",
    "so far , we have shown the commutation  along a given trajectory  of the hessians of the potentials of the @xmath28-mapping and the @xmath29-mapping for the same starting time @xmath26 ( e.g. , for the @xmath59-mapping and the @xmath60-mapping of fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] ) .",
    "a similar argument proves the commutation of the hessians of the potentials of two mappings , such that the ending time of one of them coincides with the starting time of the second one ( e.g. , for @xmath60-mapping and the @xmath61-mapping ) .",
    "combining these two results and relying again on the theorem on codiagonalizability of symmetric commuting matrices , we find that the hessians of the potentials of the @xmath59-mapping and of the @xmath61-mapping commute . thus we have established that , along any given trajectory , the hessians associated with arbitrary pairs of times commute .     and @xmath0 to times @xmath62 and @xmath63.,width=321 ]      here we give an alternative formulation of omni - potentiality in terms of commutation of hessians and their time derivatives .",
    "we need some preparatory material regarding @xmath38 symmetric matrices with smooth time dependence .",
    "suppose at any two times @xmath11 and @xmath64 they commute : @xmath65 differentiating this equation in @xmath64 and letting @xmath66 , we find that at any time @xmath67 commutes with its time derivative @xmath68 : @xmath69 we shall show now that the converse is also true : if at any time @xmath11 ( i ) relation is satisfied , and ( ii ) all eigenvalues @xmath70 of the symmetric matrix @xmath67 are distinct , then holds true for any times @xmath11 and @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath67 is symmetric , it can be expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a unitary @xmath38 matrix , and @xmath73 is diagonal .",
    "consider the identity @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the identity matrix ; differentiating it in time yields @xmath76 thus @xmath77 is an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "we substitute into , and multiply it by @xmath72 on the left and by @xmath78 on the right , obtaining @xmath79 i.e. , the matrix @xmath80 commutes with @xmath73 .",
    "this matrix is symmetric due to the antisymmetry of @xmath81 . by the theorem on codiagonalizability of commuting symmetric matrices , the matrices @xmath80 and @xmath73 are thus simultaneously diagonalizable ; but @xmath73 is already diagonal , and hence so is @xmath80 .",
    "the entries of the latter matrix are @xmath82 , and therefore @xmath83 for all @xmath84 ( we use here the condition that all eigenvalues of @xmath85 are distinct ) .",
    "the antisymmetry of @xmath81 implies that all diagonal entries of @xmath81 also vanish , and thus @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 vanishes . in other words ,",
    "variation of @xmath85 in time consists solely of variation of its eigenvalues @xmath70 .",
    "this implies .",
    "the restriction that all the eigenvalues be distinct does not significantly affect the generality of the statement : if they are not distinct at some isolated times , the relation @xmath88 remains satisfied at these times by continuity .",
    "returning to the problem of omni - potentiality , we now take @xmath89 this hessian @xmath90 is the jacobian of the lagrangian map @xmath91 . by the above result , omni - potentiality is equivalent to the commutation , at any time , of the jacobian and its time derivative .",
    "we have seen earlier that omni - potential flow has a velocity which is bi - potential , i.e. , potential in both eulerian and lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the statement just derived allows to prove the converse , namely that a flow with a bi - potential velocity ( and some convexity requirements ) is omni - potential .",
    "let us denote by @xmath92 and @xmath93 the lagrangian and eulerian velocity , respectively . since @xmath15 is the lagrangian map , we obviously have @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the inverse lagrangian map , whose jacobian is @xmath96 .",
    "we now calculate the eulerian velocity gradient , using . by the chain rule , for any @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ", we have : @xmath99    thus , the eulerian velocity gradient is the product of the matrices @xmath96 and @xmath100 . for the eulerian velocity to be potential ,",
    "it is necessary and ( locally ) sufficient that this product be a symmetric matrix .",
    "the commutation of the symmetric matrices @xmath96 and @xmath100 is equivalent to the commutation of @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "equivalence to omni - potentiality follows from the statement derived above .      in the zeldovich approximation",
    "each particle keeps its initial velocity unaltered in the course of time , and hence particles move along straight lines ( at least before multi - streaming occurs ) .",
    "the lagrangian map at time @xmath11 is @xmath102 where @xmath7 is the velocity potential , prescribed at @xmath103 .",
    "the hessian of this map is @xmath104 , where @xmath75 is the identity matrix and the matrix @xmath105 is the hessian of the initial potential . for a given @xmath3 , the eigendirections of the associated hessian are those of the hessian of the initial velocity potential . clearly , all these hessians commute and , by the results of sec .  [ sub : commu ] , such a flow is omni - potential .",
    "more general examples of omni - potential flows can be constructed by performing an arbitrary nonlinear transformation of the time and by time - dependent zooming of space . in space of any dimension @xmath106 , consider the flows defined by the potentials @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are arbitrary functions of time .",
    "clearly , these are again omni - potential .    in general",
    ", the trajectories associated with are not straight lines .",
    "however , if we look at them with a time - dependent magnifying glass which applies a zooming factor @xmath110 , they become straight . furthermore ,",
    "if we introduce a new time variable @xmath111 , particles move again with a constant velocity . hence , the flows defined by are trivial generalizations of zeldovich flows , and will here be called _ zeldovich - type _ flows .",
    "our goal is to find omni - potential flows that are not of this type .",
    "we derive here a differential equation for the potential of a two - dimensional omni - potential flow .",
    "it turns out to be a linear second - order pde .",
    "consider a symmetric @xmath112 matrix @xmath85 .",
    "suppose its eigenvector associated with eigenvalue @xmath113 makes angle @xmath114 with the cartesian axis @xmath115 .",
    "thus , @xmath116 @xmath117 in order to eliminate the eigenvalue @xmath113 , we multiply the first of these equations by @xmath118 and the second one by @xmath119 . subtracting afterwards the second equation from the first one , we obtain @xmath120 prescribing the r.h.s .  of uniquely defines the orthogonal frame of the two eigendirections .",
    "( the values of @xmath121 define the angle @xmath114 modulo @xmath122 ; however , changing @xmath123 swaps the eigendirections , but does not affect the set of eigendirections . )    in an omni - potential flow , the eigendirections of the hessians of the @xmath124-potentials should depend only on the lagrangian position @xmath3 and not on the time @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath125 be a two - dimensional omni - potential flow and let us denote by @xmath126 the common value of @xmath121 along the particle trajectory emanating from @xmath3 .",
    "it then follows from that @xmath127    the search for two - dimensional omni - potential flow has thus been reduced to finding solutions to for suitably prescribed functions @xmath126 .",
    "the main question that we address in this paper is whether omni - potential flows exist that are not of zeldovich type . in this section",
    "we give a positive reply to this question both in the two- and three - dimensional spaces by providing explicit examples of polynomial potentials for mappings induced by such flows .",
    "an example of an omni - potential flow in a space of arbitrary dimension is provided by spherically - symmetric potentials of the form @xmath128 : a simple calculation reveals the commutation of hessians of such potentials , calculated at different times at different points of a trajectory .",
    "this example shares with zeldovich flows the property that the trajectories are straight lines  in this case , in the radial direction .",
    "we would like to construct less symmetric examples .      in @xmath129 ,",
    "the problem of finding omni - potential flows has been recast into the form of the partial differential equation with the initial condition @xmath130 ( which generates the identity map ) .",
    "we can therefore construct examples of two - dimensional omni - potential flows by finding different solutions to for a given function @xmath126 in the r.h.s . by linearity ,",
    "any linear combination of such solutions with time - dependent coefficients is also a solution to .",
    "for example , if @xmath131 and @xmath132 are two sufficiently smooth independent solutions that are also independent of @xmath130 ( which is always a solution to ) , then the flow with the potential @xmath133 is omni - potential , and is typically not of zeldovich type ; for this , the functions of time @xmath134 and @xmath135 must be linearly independent and sufficiently small , so as not to spoil the convexity stemming from the @xmath130 term .",
    "when @xmath126 is a ratio of homogeneous polynomials of @xmath3 ( say , of the same degree @xmath136 ) , solutions to can be obtained by a purely algebraic method .",
    "a solution can be sought in the form of a homogeneous polynomial , @xmath137 , of degree @xmath138 ; then reduces to a system of @xmath139 equations for the coefficients of @xmath137 and @xmath126 .",
    "( in what follows , @xmath140 denotes certain homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath141 defined in @xmath18 . )",
    "the function @xmath126 involves @xmath142 independent coefficients ( since the numerator and denominator can be multiplied by any constant without changing @xmath126 ) , and the polynomial @xmath137 involves @xmath141 independent coefficients ( since a solution to can be multiplied by any constant without yielding a new independent solution ) .",
    "comparison of the number of equations , @xmath139 , with the total number of the unknown coefficients , @xmath143 , suggests that we can construct a family of such solutions , parameterized by @xmath144 coefficients of @xmath126 .",
    "however , the system of equations for the coefficients is , in general , nonlinear , and hence its solvability can not be established just by counting the numbers of the unknowns and equations .",
    "when @xmath126 is the ratio of linear functions , the equations for the coefficients of @xmath137 are linear , and can be solved for any prescribed coefficients of  @xmath126 .    since the potential @xmath145 is required to be a convex function on the entire plane @xmath129 , we start by seeking homogeneous polynomials @xmath137 involving only even powers of @xmath115 and @xmath146 .",
    "an instance of a solvable linear system of equations yielding the coefficients of such polynomials is obtained for @xmath147 where the coefficients @xmath148 and @xmath149 may take arbitrary preset values . for such @xmath126 , a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath150 , @xmath151 , solving ,",
    "is @xmath152 in particular , the first low - degree polynomial solutions are : @xmath153 as one can see , the polynomial vanishes identically for integer @xmath154 and @xmath155 such that @xmath156 , and @xmath157 for these isolated values in the plane of parameters , there exist nevertheless two independent solutions , namely @xmath158 this can be easily seen by differentiating in @xmath148 and @xmath149 and substituting the parameter values .",
    "clearly , @xmath159 is convex , if all coefficients in are positive , i.e. , if @xmath160 thus , the potentials @xmath161 are convex for @xmath162 , if in addition all @xmath163 are non - negative ( this condition is sufficient , but not necessary ) and tend to zero fast enough to guarantee convergence of the series at any point @xmath3 and termwise differentiability of in the spatial variables . if the sum is finite and the maximum degree of the polynomials involved is @xmath164 , then the potential is convex for @xmath165 .",

    "the convex potentials satisfy all requirements for omni - potential flows in the plane , and are not of zeldovich type .",
    "so far , we have considered only even - degree homogeneous polynomial solutions or linear combinations thereof .",
    "is an admixture of odd - degree homogeneous polynomials permitted ?",
    "if such an odd - degree addition has a degree higher than that of the highest even - degree homogenous polynomial comprised in the solution , then convexity in the whole plane is ruled out .",
    "however , in a finite domain , convexity need not be lost , provided the odd polynomial is scaled by a sufficiently small factor .",
    "this is precisely what happens when @xmath126 is given by : a homogeneous polynomial of odd degree @xmath169 can be a solution to only for @xmath151 and @xmath170 the solution for these parameter values is @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 and @xmath174 are arbitrary constants .",

    "the approach that has been applied in the previous subsection for construction of an example in dimension two can not be immediately generalized to higher - dimensional spaces : while in @xmath129 a single invariant determines whether two symmetric matrices are codiagonalizable and hence equation fixes the set of eigendirections of a symmetric matrix @xmath85 , in @xmath178 at least three such invariants must be considered simultaneously ( see the appendix ) . in dimension three , equations  applied for the entries of the hessian of an unknown potential give rise to three partial differential equations in the potential , @xmath179 that must be satisfied simultaneously . here",
    "the time - independent quantities @xmath180 are related to the invariants @xmath181 introduced in the appendix : @xmath182 the invariants are combinations of the entries of a symmetric matrix , which depend only on the set of eigendirections and not on the eigenvalues .",
    "the algebraic theory of the invariants presented in the appendix does not take into account the properties of the hessian , stemming from the specific structure of its entries ( for instance , each row and a column of the hessian is a gradient , which implies certain differential relations between the entries ) .",
    "it is unclear how to prescribe @xmath180 , taking into account these additional constraints , for the equations to have at least two distinct solutions .    because of this difficulty , instead of considering the invariants and solving equations  , we exploit the fact that omni - potentiality of flows amounts to commutation of the hessians of the various @xmath183-mappings along any trajectory ( see sec .

    "we shall construct our examples in @xmath18 using the following strategy .",

    "we have followed another approach , whereby the field of eigendirections of the commuting hessians is characterized by prescribing the set of invariants , from which the field of eigendirections of the commuting hessians can be uniquely determined . in @xmath129",
    "just one such invariant , @xmath126 ( see ) , should be considered . in @xmath178",
    "one must consider three invariants , for instance ,  of the appendix , giving rise to three nonlinear equations . as in the former approach , these equations must be satisfied simultaneously , and hence a solution does not exist for an arbitrary set of prescribed invariants .",

    "the equations are linear and thus simpler , but one is left with just one function which can be tuned to achieve consistency of the three equations under consideration ; in the latter approach the equations are nonlinear and thus more involved , but one has the freedom of tuning three a priori independent scalar functions to gain consistency of the equations .",

    "( we recall that a double eigenvalue is an event of codimension two , which typically takes place at isolated locations . )",
    "let @xmath277 and @xmath278 be two unit eigenvectors of @xmath255 , chosen to depend smoothly on @xmath3 in @xmath276 .",
    "the condition that the gradient of the eikonal function be parallel to an eigendirection can now be expressed as @xmath279 in words , these equations state that either @xmath277 or @xmath278 is normal to the level lines of the eikonal function .",
    "equivalently , the level lines of @xmath280 are the integral curves defined by either @xmath278 or @xmath277 .",
    "these form a set of orthogonal curves .",

    "we can prescribe @xmath280 arbitrarily on one of these curves @xmath281 and extend it locally by demanding that it remains constant on all the curves orthogonal to @xmath281 .",
    "note that these orthogonal curves play here the role of rays in geometrical optics and are thus conveniently called `` rays '' .    next we write the equations for subleading corrections obtained by substituting in and identifying the coefficients of the various positive and negative powers of the large parameter @xmath264 .",
    "we shall only write the equations appearing at orders @xmath282 and @xmath283 ( the higher - order equations have a similar structure ) . for what follows",

    "equation   for the amplitude @xmath298 is of the same sort , except that it has an inhomogeneous term involving @xmath297 .",
    "we may thus take vanishing data for @xmath298 on an arbitrary curve orthogonal to the rays .",
    "higher - order amplitudes satisfy similar inhomogeneous transport equations .",

    "for example , we can take @xmath303 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath11 and sufficiently small @xmath304 , the last two terms in the r.h.s .  of will not spoil the convexity of the first term .",
    "we have thus constructed ( locally ) omni - potential flows for a quite arbitrary initial velocity . for large @xmath264 ,",
    "the trajectories resulting from differ only minutely from the straight zeldovich trajectories associated with the two first terms",
    ". however , these flows are not of zeldovich type because of the third term in the r.h.s .",
    "if we try to extend the above wkb procedure from two to three dimensions , we encounter an obstacle already in constructing the eikonal function @xmath280 .",
    "as we have seen , its gradient with respect to the lagrangian position @xmath305 should be everywhere parallel to an eigendirection of the hessian @xmath105 . denoting by @xmath306 a unit eigenvector , taken with a smooth @xmath305-dependence , we should then have @xmath307 where @xmath308 is a scalar function .",
    "in other words , the 1-form @xmath309 should have an integrating factor ( a factor which makes it an exact 1-form ) .",
    "this is in general possible ( locally ) in two , but not in three dimensions .",
    "so far our point of view has been kinematical : we constructed omni - potential flows without any underlying dynamical equations . in cosmology",
    "the dynamical setting is rather well known and discussed for example in ref .",
    "let us just recall a few salient points .",
    "the most widely accepted explanation of the large - scale structure seen in galaxy surveys is that it results from small primordial fluctuations that grew under gravitational self - interaction of collisionless cold dark matter particles in an expanding universe .",
    "the evolution of the mostly collisionless matter in the universe is described by the vlasov  poisson system in the position - velocity phase space . at early times , i.e. , close to the epoch of matter - radiation decoupling , the expansion of the universe selects a single velocity solution at each position rather than a distribution of velocities .",
    "this feature persists until particle crossing ( `` shell - crossing '' in the cosmological language ) , where multi - stream solutions are developed . as long as multi - streaming is ruled out or is confined to scales sufficiently small to be neglected , the vlasov  poisson system may be replaced by the euler - poisson system . following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite and using eulerian comoving coordinates , @xmath4 , together with a time variable @xmath20 based on the amplitude factor of the growing mode of linear theory , we can write the euler  poisson system as @xmath310 here , @xmath311 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath312 the density ( suitably normalized ) and @xmath313 the gravitational potential . as @xmath314 , to avoid singularities , the density must approach unity everywhere ; thus the distribution of matter is in the leading order uniform as @xmath314 .",
    "similarly , @xmath315 as @xmath314 ; thus the initial velocity is potential , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "it then follows from that the velocity stays potential at any later time .",
    "reconstruction handles the euler  poisson system as a two - point boundary - value problem in which the initial density is prescribed as uniform and the final ( current ) density is given by astronomical observations .",
    "this is a mass transport problem whose cost function is the action associated with the euler",
    " poisson equations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , because this action is a rather complicated functional , we do not yet possess efficient numerical algorithms allowing us to solve this mass transport problem .",
    "the situation simplifies with the zeldovich approximation , which amounts to setting to zero the r.h.s .  of . the remaining equations are then ( i ) the three - dimensional inviscid burgers equation , which implies that particles are moving with constant velocity ( in the coordinates here chosen ) , and ( ii ) the continuity equation expressing mass conservation .",
    "the action to be minimized for reconstruction reduces then to its kinetic energy term . as a consequence ,",
    "the cost function is just the mass - weighted integral of the squared displacement of fluid particles from their initial ( lagrangian ) positions @xmath3 to their current ( eulerian ) positions @xmath4 , as required by a theorem of brenier @xcite .",
    "after discretization , this mass transport problem becomes an assignment problem , which can be solved by efficient algorithms ( see sec .",

    "this is the essence of the monge ",
    "ampre  kantorovich ( mak ) reconstruction method .",

    "@xcite tested the quality of mak reconstruction by applying it to final states of standard n - body simulations , that were performed for various random initial conditions of cosmological relevance .",
    "the authors of @xcite noted the unprecedented accuracy of the reconstructions down to a few megaparsecs .",
    "in particular , they performed comparisons between three different lagrangian maps : ( i ) the map based on the n - body integration , ( ii ) the map obtained by applying the mak procedure to the current density field , calculated by the n - body integration , ( iii ) the map obtained by applying the zeldovich approximation , starting from the same initial condition as for the n - body simulation .",
    "the conclusion of their comparisons is that the n - body map is approximated much better by the mak - generated map than by the zeldovich map .",
    "this is particularly striking in their fig .  7 , which shows the negative lagrangian divergence of the displacement @xmath316 , obtained by the three methods mentioned above .",
    "can we understand this good performance of mak reconstruction on sufficiently large spatial scales ?",
    "first , let us make the rather obvious observation that any lagrangian map that is the ( lagrangian ) gradient of a convex function ( here called the `` brenier property '' ) will be reconstructed exactly ( in a discretized version ) , if we solve the associated quadratic - cost optimal transport problem , for example , by using the mak procedure",
    ". here is a trivial example of this : if we let an initially quasi - uniform mass distribution evolve by pure zeldovich dynamics to a final distribution and there is no shell crossing , then the mak reconstruction is exact . if the solutions to the euler  poisson equations had the brenier property , mak would perform an exact reconstruction , but they do nt : flows which solve the euler ",
    "poisson equations have no eulerian vorticity but do generate lagrangian vorticity @xcite .",
    "however there exists a refinement of the zeldovich approximation which possesses the brenier property .",
    "this is given by the second - order of the lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "here we shall not describe the lagrangian perturbation theory in any technical details since the reader can find them in the above publications .",
    "nevertheless , in order to discuss some of its conceptual problems , we describe briefly a few key steps .",
    "one rewrites the euler ",
    "poisson equations in lagrangian coordinates , to obtain a set of nonlinear equations for the displacement @xmath316 and its space and time partial derivatives . assuming then that in a suitable sense ( see below ) the displacement is small , o@xmath317",
    ", one expands the equations in powers of the small parameter @xmath304 . here , the only perturbed quantities are the deviations of the particle trajectory from the homogeneous hubble flow , i.e. , from a purely expanding universe . at the first order , o@xmath317 , one has the zeldovich approximation , which , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : linea ] , is omni - potential . in particular ,",
    "the lagrangian map is potential ( by the brenier property ) and the velocity is potential in both eulerian and lagrangian coordinates . as we have said , with the lagrangian perturbation theory , one may refine the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( usually denoted by l2 ) captures significant gravitational physics , for example some tidal effects @xcite , whose importance in the large scale structure formation has been widely recognized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "l2 has the remarkable property that , for standard cosmological initial conditions , the lagrangian map is still potential . as a consequence ,",
    "the velocity is also potential in lagrangian coordinates . with l2 , in eulerian coordinates the velocity is potential only up to second order .",
    "one would have to sum the whole series to arbitrarily high orders of the lagrangian perturbation theory ( i.e. , to arbitrary orders of @xmath304 ) to recover the eulerian potentiality of the velocity ( but note that convergence of the asymptotic series is not guaranteed @xcite ) .",
    "l2 having the brenier property , the lagrangian and inverse lagrangian maps can be reconstructed exactly as an optimal transport problem , for example , by the mak technique .",
    "this is probably the main reason why mak performs well ( at sufficiently large scales ) .",
    "beyond the second order of the lagrangian perturbation theory , scales below the non - linearity scale are expected to play a decisive role and lagrangian vorticity is unavoidable @xcite .",
    "such scales can not be handled accurately by standard mak reconstruction .",
    "finally , let us discuss briefly the thorny issue of the validity of the lagrangian perturbation theory . as mentioned before ,",
    "the euler ",
    "poisson equations are a consequence of the vlasov ",
    "poisson equations only as long as multi - streaming is absent .",
    "the problem is that , with any cosmologically realistic initial condition at decoupling , multi - streaming appears immediately or , anyway , well before the present epoch .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to what we would have with a one - dimensional burgers flow in which the initial velocity would be spatially non - differentiable or nearly so , for example , a velocity field whose space dependence is the ornstein  uhlenbeck process : shocks would then appear after an arbitrarily short time .",
    "this , of course , constitutes no reason to discard the euler ",
    "poisson equations for cosmology .",
    "one way to keep them is to _ regularize _ the initial velocity field by applying a low - pass filter , i.e. , by setting to zero all fourier amplitudes whose wavenumbers exceed a cutoff @xmath318 , where @xmath319 is the regularization scale .",
    "it may then be shown that no shell - crossing and thus no multi - streaming will take place for at least some finite time @xmath320 . roughly , @xmath320 is the inverse of the largest shear ( velocity gradient ) of the regularized initial velocity . up to this time",
    "the euler ",
    "poisson equations are valid .",
    "furthermore , it may be shown that , up to time @xmath8 , the small parameter which controls the validity of the lagrangian perturbation theory ( including that of the zeldovich approximation ) is @xmath321 .",
    "of course , the true problem is not regularized , or only barely so .",
    "comparison with n - body simulations suggests nevertheless that the lagrangian perturbation theory remains valid for @xmath322 when looking only at scales greater than @xmath319 .",
    "understanding this from a theoretical point of view is a challenge , which has been partially addressed by buchert @xcite .",
    "the main question that we have addressed in this paper concerns omni - potentiality , the ( convex ) potential character of the mapping from any time @xmath0 to any time @xmath323 with @xmath324 .",
    "first , we have considered a class of flows of `` zeldovich type '' , comprised of pure zeldovich / burgers flows and those obtained from them by application of arbitrary nonlinear transformations of the time variable and arbitrary time - dependent scale factors .",
    "such flows are trivially omni - potential .",
    "so are spherically symmetric flows .",
    "we then have investigated ( i ) the existence of non - trivial omni - potential flows , ( ii ) their genericity : can we prescribe the initial velocity potential in an arbitrary way ?",
    "the flows have been characterized by their lagrangian maps @xmath325 in terms of the scalar potential @xmath145 . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sub : commu ] , omni - potentiality implies that along any particle trajectory the hessians @xmath326 commute and thus have common eigendirections .",
    "the field of such eigendirections is prescribed as a function of the initial ( lagrangian ) position @xmath3 , for example , by the eigendirections of the hessian of the initial velocity potential @xmath327 .",
    "the set of eigendirections of a real symmetric @xmath38 matrix depends on @xmath191 parameters and can be characterized , for example , by @xmath191 of the invariants discussed in the appendix . as we try to determine a single scalar function @xmath145 , the situation is rather different in two and higher dimensions .",
    "when @xmath328 , we have a single invariant expressible as a ratio of suitable combinations of spatial second derivatives of @xmath145 .",
    "thus , prescribing the field of the invariant values , @xmath126 , we obtain a linear second - order pde , , for @xmath145 . for a suitable family of fields @xmath126 ,",

    "these flows are actually close to zeldovich flows with straight trajectories ( but are not of `` zeldovich type '' ) . extending this construction globally in space and avoiding the rapid spatial oscillations inherent to a wkb method constitute interesting open problems .    when @xmath197 , omni - potentiality can be expressed in either of two equivalent ways .",
    "one is to demand the commutation of the hessians of @xmath145 with those of a prescribed @xmath327 ; this gives @xmath191 linear homogeneous second - order pdes .",

    "note that the euler  poisson flow is potential in eulerian coordinates , but not in general in lagrangian coordinates . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : cosmo ] , the approximate euler  poisson flow obtained by the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( l2 ) is exactly potential in lagrangian coordinates  and thus its inverse lagrangian map can be obtained exactly by the monge ",
    "ampre  kantorovich ( mak ) procedure  however , it is only approximately potential in eulerian coordinates and thus must be qualified as an approximately omni - potential flow . in particular",
    ", it does not represent an example of an exactly omni - potential three - dimensional flow for an arbitrary smooth initial velocity .",
    "we finally wish to mention a concrete open problem of cosmological interest : as mentioned , mak gives the exact inverse lagrangian map for l2 ( and this contributes to explaining why mak works so well when tested with n - body simulations ) .",
    "however , in l2 , between the eulerian position @xmath4 and its lagrangian antecedent @xmath3 , the trajectory is not given exactly by the zeldovich approximation that has a constant velocity @xmath330 ( in the coordinates we used in sec .",
    "[ s : cosmo ] ) .",
    "the actual l2 trajectory is slightly curved and its current ( peculiar ) velocity differs slightly from @xmath330 .",
    "it would be of interest to find  how to perturbatively handle such discrepancies .",

    "here we show how the set of commuting symmetric real @xmath271-dimensional matrices , having prescribed eigendirections , can be characterized by a certain number of invariants , which are rational functions of the matrix entries .",
    "the findings here may be of interest beyond the study of omni - potential flow .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these results are not available in the published literature .",
    "if the reader is aware of any relevant reference , kindly inform the authors .    by the theorem on codiagonalizability of commuting symmetric matrices , in an omni - potential flow",
    ", hessians of the potential of the lagrangian map must have the same set of eigendirections at all times along any trajectory .",
    "we therefore ask ourselves a more general question : suppose , the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are being varied while the eigendirections remain fixed .",
    "which quantities constructed from the entries of the matrix are unaltered under such variations ?",
    "we call such quantities _ invariants_. for a two - dimensional matrix @xmath331 , as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ s : geometry ] , the eigendirections depend on the single invariant @xmath332 . when @xmath333 , our question can , in principle , be answered by first solving the characteristic equation whose roots are the eigenvalues and then determining the eigendirections .",
    "however , the expressions for the eigendirections will then involve radicals , so that obtaining rational expressions for the invariants is not easy .",
    "anyway , when @xmath334 , the non - solvability of the characteristic equation by radicals renders this strategy useless . we need therefore a more practical general algebraic approach to this problem .",
    "let us assume that all eigenvalues @xmath70 of a symmetric @xmath38 matrix @xmath85 are distinct , and thus all eigendirections are uniquely defined .",
    "description of an arbitrary set of @xmath271 orthogonal eigendirections in @xmath18 requires @xmath191 parameters : @xmath271 arbitrary directions require @xmath335 parameters , from which one must subtract the number of orthogonality conditions , @xmath191 .",
    "we expect therefore that a set of @xmath191 suitably chosen invariants uniquely defines the eigendirections .",
    "the problem of finding such invariants is an instance of a much more general problem of characterizing linear subspaces of a vector space ; here the vector space is that of all real symmetric matrices and the subspace that of matrices having prescribed eigendirections , which is spanned by the set of all the powers , from zero to @xmath275 , of this matrix .",
    "the general problem can be , in principle , handled using plcker coordinates @xcite . for our problem , a more direct approach is available , as now explained . for @xmath329 ,",
    "our characterization involves fewer invariants than the corresponding number of plcker coordinates .",
    "we denote by @xmath336 an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue @xmath70 , and assume without any loss of generality that no component of any eigenvector vanishes ; one can always achieve this by suitably rotating the orthonormal basis in @xmath18 , in which the eigenvectors are decomposed .",
    "we construct the invariants as follows : we set , for some @xmath337 and @xmath338 , @xmath339 where @xmath340 and @xmath341 denote symmetric homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath338 , @xmath342 for @xmath343 . by construction ,",
    "the quantities @xmath344 depend only on the eigendirections ( through the ratios of components ) and are invariant under permutations of the eigendirections ; thus they depend only on the set of eigendirections .",
    "then one substitutes into the respective components of the eigenvectors @xmath336 , expressed in terms of the associated eigenvalues @xmath70 and of the entries of the matrix @xmath85 .",
    "it is easily seen that this will produce rational functions of the matrix entries and of the eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , it may be shown that the eigenvalues enter only through symmetric polynomial combinations , which  by vite s theorem applied to the characteristic polynomial  have a polynomial dependence on the matrix entries .",
    "the actual derivation of the invariants can be partially simplified by making use of the identity @xmath345      we obtain thus @xmath346 invariants @xmath344 in the form of rational functions of the entries of the symmetric matrix @xmath85 . evidently , these invariants are too numerous to be independent .",
    "for instance , for any @xmath347 and @xmath348 they clearly satisfy the relations ( no summation on repeated indices ! ) @xmath349 @xmath350 and @xmath351 identities and link invariants @xmath344 for , say , @xmath352 with those for @xmath353 ; there are @xmath354 of such independent relations between invariants .",
    "equations imply @xmath355 for any @xmath356 ; conversely , any relation follows from these relations together with .",
    "thus , the identities contribute further @xmath357 independent relations .",
    "another family of relations involves the invariants @xmath360 .",
    "for @xmath361 , let @xmath362 denote the @xmath363th power of the matrix @xmath85 and let @xmath364 denote its entries , which are of course readily expressed in terms of the entries of the matrix @xmath85 ; we also set @xmath365 .",
    "the relations @xmath366 that hold true , for any @xmath97 and @xmath141 , by definition of eigenvectors of @xmath85 , @xmath336 , and the identity @xmath367 imply , for each @xmath368 , the relation @xmath369 since , by the cayley ",
    "hamilton theorem , any matrix is a root of its characteristic polynomial , the entries @xmath364 for @xmath370 are linear combinations of @xmath371 for , the coefficients in these linear combinations being independent of indices @xmath363 , @xmath136 and @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , relation for @xmath370 is a consequence of @xmath271 such relations for @xmath372 such that @xmath373 .",
    "the relation for @xmath374 is trivial , and hence there are @xmath275 independent relations for @xmath375 .    in principle , the total number @xmath346 of invariants @xmath344 should exceed the number @xmath191 of independent invariants by the number of relations between the invariants . for arbitrary @xmath271 , we have obtained above @xmath376 independent relations . for @xmath197 ,",
    "they constitute 15  relations constraining the 18 invariants that we have introduced ; this fits our expectations that at most 3 invariants are independent , because the orthogonal frame of eigendirections of a @xmath377 symmetric matrix is described by 3 euler angles . for @xmath329 the number of the obtained independent relations is still insufficient to fill the gap , and more relations are to be identified .      as an example , we present a detailed derivation of the invariant @xmath378 for @xmath328 .",
    "the @xmath97th eigenvector of a @xmath112 symmetric matrix @xmath85 is @xmath379 , and hence @xmath380 the characteristic equation for the eigenvalues is @xmath381 and hence @xmath382 . by virtue of , @xmath383 consequently ,",
    "@xmath384 the invariant @xmath385 can be found by a similar calculation , or just by swapping subscripts in the expression for @xmath378 ; clearly , the two invariants are interrelated : @xmath386 .",
    "the invariant @xmath387 turns out to be degenerate : @xmath388 thus , we have obtained the same invariant as that found in sec .",
    "[ sub : eqn2d ] .",
    "we consider now invariants in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the @xmath97th eigenvector of a @xmath377 symmetric matrix @xmath85 has components @xmath389 @xmath390 the procedure outlined above yields @xmath391 @xmath392 is the ratio of two polynomials , which we calculate using : @xmath393 @xmath394 can be found by applying identity : @xmath395 ( here @xmath396 can be obtained by permuting the subscripts 1 and 2 in ) .",
    "the three invariants @xmath181 for @xmath397 uniquely define the three ratios @xmath398 : by vite s theorem , they are roots of the cubic equation @xmath399 the eigendirections can be recovered in the form of three eigenvectors @xmath400 .",
    "one can try to obtain the third components @xmath401 ( @xmath402 from the relations expressing orthogonality of the eigendirections . however , this produces two solutions : if @xmath403 is obtained in this way , then @xmath404 is also a solution .",
    "hence , the invariants @xmath181 , @xmath397 , define two distinct sets of eigendirections",
    ". the non - uniqueness is eliminated , if in addition we know any of the invariants @xmath405 or @xmath406 for @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "it is unclear , whether one can choose a set of three invariants uniquely defining three eigendirections .    when all invariants @xmath409 are known for @xmath410 and 3 , the equations for the entries of symmetric matrix @xmath85 can be considerably simplified . in view of and the same equation with permuted subscripts 2 and 3 ,",
    "relation can be expressed as @xmath411 adding to its analogue , where subscripts 1 and 2 are permuted , we obtain @xmath412 permuting subscripts in this equation , we obtain a linear system of equations for the non - diagonal entries of @xmath85 .",
    "( here , we note that the sum of and its counterparts with permuted subscripts reduces to for @xmath413 . ) upon solving this linear system , we find the differences @xmath414 from and the analogues of this equation with permuted subscripts , i.e. , we determine all diagonal entries up to an additive constant . further determination of the matrix @xmath85 would require , of course , the knowledge of its three eigenvalues .",
    "this implies that the non - diagonal entries , as determined from the above - mentioned linear system , involve two free parameters .",
    "this , in turn , requires that be equivalent to any equation , obtained from it by permutation of subscripts .",
    "consequently , we obtain further relations between the invariants : permuting subscripts , say , 1 and 3 in , we get @xmath415 this equation is equivalent to if and only if @xmath416 and @xmath417 in view of , the first of these relations is equivalent to @xmath418 and the second one follows from and the relation obtained from by permuting subscripts 1 and 3 .",
    "relation and its analogues with permuted subscripts can , of course , be established directly .",
    "such relations can be used in three dimensions for verifying the consistency of the invariants , instead of using , one of our basic relations between invariants .",
