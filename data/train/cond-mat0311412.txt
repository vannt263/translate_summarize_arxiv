    "two - dimensional electron systems have been investigated by a number of investigators . their importance seems to have recently increased due to possible applications to spintronics for electronic devices .",
    "the properties of two - dimensional electron systems are determined by the coulomb interaction between electrons and depend crucially on the density , temperature and spin - polarization . in principle , exact results can be obtained by the numerical experiments and are available to some extent at zero temperature . at finite temperatures , however ,",
    "reliable numerical experiments are still awaited and the importance of theoretical approach is not reduced .",
    "recently , dharma - wardana and perrot have developed a method called classical - map hypernetted - chain method ( chnc)@xcite .",
    "they determine the quantum temperature @xmath3 so that the classical system at the temperature @xmath3 has the same correlation energy as the quantum system at @xmath4 and assume that the properties of the system at the finite temperature @xmath5 is given by those of classical system at the temperature @xmath6 one can include the higher - order cluster interactions in classical fluids applying the modified hnc method@xcite and taking the bridge function into account .",
    "various properties of two - dimensional electronic systems at zero - temperature have been examined by bulutay and tanatar@xcite based on the chnc method without bridge corrections .",
    "we here extend the analysis to finite temperature two - dimensional electronic systems with arbitrary spin - polarization . confirming that our results reduce to those of ref .",
    "6 at low temperatures such that @xmath7 , we analyze the finite temperature effects for @xmath8 , @xmath1 being the fermi temperature .",
    "we observe that the effects are substantial at high densities irrespective of spin - polarization .",
    "it is shown that , within our analyses without bridge functions , the two - dimensional electron system remains paramagnetic until the wigner lattice formation . in ref .",
    "4 , the existence of a ferromagnetic phase before the formation of wigner lattice is predicted and , in such a domain , one needs careful treatment including the bridge function .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze fundamental quantities in a wide domain of density , temperature , and spin - polarization where one may neglect the bridge function as in ref .",

    "it is seen from the figure that the spin - polarization effect is more pronounced at higher temperatures and densities .      to compare the electron correlation effects in two and three dimensions , we plot the exchange - correlation and correlation free energies as a function of temperature in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "we find that our results of the temperature dependence of the free energy in two dimensions are similar to those in three dimensions@xcite .    to check the validity of the chnc scheme used in this paper , we compare our exchange - correlation energy with monte carlo ( mc ) and singwi - tosi - land - sjlander scheme ( stls ) results given in refs .",
