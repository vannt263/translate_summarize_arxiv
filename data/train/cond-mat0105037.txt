    "despite extensive study@xcite , several fundamental questions about the kinetic ising model with glauber dynamics still remain unanswered @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the following basic issue : what is the final state of a finite ising - glauber spin system when it is suddenly quenched from infinite temperature to zero temperature@xcite ?",
    "an infinite system undergoes coarsening , that is , the spins organize into a coarsening domain mosaic of up and down spins , with the characteristic domain length scale growing as @xmath2 . for a finite system",
    ", this coarsening is interrupted when the typical domain size reaches the system size @xmath3 .",
    "rather unexpectedly , this interruption can cause the system to get stuck in an infinitely long - lived metastable state . in two dimensions",
    ", it appears that , as @xmath4 , this probability of getting stuck is approximately @xmath5 , while for @xmath6 the ground state is never reached .    to provide context for the question of the ultimate fate of the ising - glauber system ,",
    "consider the limiting cases of @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 .",
    "for a linear chain of length @xmath3 which initially contains @xmath9 up spins and @xmath10 down spins , the final state of the system follows from two facts .",
    "first , the average magnetization is conserved under glauber dynamics @xcite and second , the only possible final states are all spins up or all spins down ; there are no metastable states in one dimension . to achieve a final magnetization which equals the initial magnetization",
    ", a fraction @xmath11 of all realizations must end with all spins up and the complementary fraction must end with all spins down .",
    "thus the probability @xmath12 to ultimately have all spins up as a function of the initial concentration of up spins @xmath11 is simply @xmath13 .",
    "a very different result holds in the mean - field limit .",
    "a simple realization of this limit is the complete graph , in which each spin interacts with every other spin in the system . here",
    ", a non - zero magnetization makes it energetically favorable for any minority spin to flip , so that the majority phase quickly fills the system for all @xmath14 .",
    "therefore on the complete graph , @xmath12 is simply the step function @xmath15 .",
    "we argue that in two and higher dimensions the probability that one phase eventually wins also converges to a step function in @xmath16 but with strange anomalies when @xmath17 .",
    "as mentioned above , the system has a non - zero probability of getting stuck in a metastable state which consists of two or more straight stripes in two dimensions . in greater than two dimensions ,",
    "the probability that the ground state is reached quickly vanishes with system size .",
    "intriguingly , the final state is not static , but rather consists of stochastic `` blinkers '' .",
    "these are localized sets of spins which can flip _ ad infinitum _ without any energy cost .",
    "thus the system wanders forever on a connected set of equal - energy states defined by these blinkers . in the categorization proposed by newman and stein@xcite ,",
    "the ising system in high spatial dimension is of type @xmath18 ( `` mixed '' ) in that a fraction of the spins flip a finite number of times , while the complementary fraction flip infinitely often .",
    "we also study the fate of the ising system in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the imposition of a field leads to bootstrap percolation phenomena@xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "an infinitesimal field is sufficient to drive the system to the energetically favorable ground state ; this is the analog of the percolation threshold being equal to 1 in @xmath19 bootstrap percolation on the square lattice . in three dimensions",
    ", the energetically favorable ground state is reached only if the field exceeds a threshold value , while for weaker fields , a transition between phase coexistence and field alignment occurs as a function of the initial concentration of field - aligned spins .",
    "this transition again can be described in terms of bootstrap percolation .",
    "finally , we examine the relaxation at non - zero temperatures . while the system eventually reaches equilibrium ,",
    "the aforementioned metastable states continue to play a significant role in the relaxation .",
    "for example in @xmath20 and temperatures up to approximately @xmath21 , there is a large time range for which the relaxation is close to that of the zero - temperature system . if a metastable stripe configuration happens to form , a time of the order of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the interaction strength between spins , must elapse before the system can escape this metastable state and reach equilibrium .",
    "we expect that analogous metastable states will influence the long - time relaxation even more strongly in higher dimensions .",
    "we study the homogeneous ferromagnetic ising model with hamiltonian @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and the sum is over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites @xmath26 .",
    "the spins are initially uncorrelated , corresponding to an initial temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath27 limit implies that the fraction of up and down spins are equal .",
    "because we are interested in subtle effects associated with zero initial magnetization , we prepare our systems with fixed magnetization , rather than fixed probability for the orientation of each spin .",
    "thus every initial configuration has @xmath28 up spins and @xmath28 down spins .",
    "we also consider the straightforward generalization to non - zero magnetization by having @xmath29 up spins and @xmath30 down spins , where @xmath11 is the initial fraction of up spins .",
    "the spins evolve by zero - temperature glauber dynamics@xcite , _",
    "i.   e. _ , we view the system as being suddenly quenched from @xmath27 to @xmath31 .",
    "( in sect .",
    "iv , we will also consider the @xmath32 case . )   for each initial spin configuration , one realization of the dynamics was performed until the final state was reached .",
    "we focus on @xmath33-dimensional hypercubic lattices with linear size @xmath3 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we choose these lattices to avoid the pathologies associated with odd - coordinated lattices , where stable convex islands of minority spins readily form and the system always freezes into a disordered state@xcite .",
    "most of our results continue to hold for free boundary conditions and on arbitrary even - coordinated lattices .",
    "glauber dynamics at zero temperature is implemented by picking a spin at random and computing the energy change @xmath34 if this spin were to flip .",
    "if @xmath34 is greater than , equal to , or less than zero , the spin flip is accepted with probability @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "after each such event , the time is incremented by @xmath38 . at long times",
    "this procedure is prohibitively slow because there are relatively few flippable spins  those with @xmath39 .",
    "thus we track and randomly pick only flippable spins , and then update the time by @xmath40 .",
    "this implementation guarantees that in one time unit , each spin attempts one flip on average .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we describe geometric properties of the final state in various spatial dimensions including the distribution of magnetization and energy in the final state , as well as the influence of an external magnetic field in determining the final state .",
    "the number of metastable states as a function of the spatial dimension is estimated in sect .",
    "iii . in sect .",
    "iv , we discuss the finite - temperature evolution in two and three dimensions .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "v with a summary and some open questions .",
    "we first address the following basic question : what is the probability @xmath12 that the ising system with @xmath29 up spins in the initial state which is then suddenly quenched to @xmath31 will ultimately have all spins up ?",
    "one could imagine three possible outcomes :    * @xmath12 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath11 .",
    "* @xmath41 for sufficiently small initial concentration of up spins @xmath42 ; @xmath12 increases monotonically for @xmath43 ; @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "* @xmath12 is the step function @xmath15 .    in one dimension @xmath13 , _",
    "i.  e. _ , the first scenario applies . in this section",
    "we shall argue that in higher dimensions the third scenario is realized .",
    "if the third scenario applies , then additional considerations are needed to determine @xmath46 .",
    "the behavior at @xmath17 is of paramount interest because in a genuine @xmath27 initial state the concentrations of up and down spins are equal ( when initial temperature exceeds @xmath47 , these concentrations are also equal as long as there is no external magnetic field ) .",
    "a general belief is that in the thermodynamic limit the system always reaches one of the ground states .",
    "the symmetry between up and down phases then implies @xmath48 .",
    "this assertion turns out to be _",
    "wrong _ for all @xmath49 ; the two - dimensional system does not always reach the ground state while in higher dimensions the system never reaches the ground state as @xmath4 .",
    "= 1.2in0.9 in 0.25 in    the crucial difference between one and higher dimensions is that no metastable states exist in one dimension while there are numerous metastable states in higher dimensions .",
    "the existence of such states@xcite is easy to visualize in two dimensions , where any stripe of width @xmath50 which traverses the entire system is obviously stable at zero temperature ( fig .",
    "[ simple ] ) .",
    "however , it is not a priori clear what is the basin of attraction of these metastable states and the relative size of this basin compared to the basin of attraction to the ground states .",
    "we now turn to numerical results which indicate that metastable states profoundly affect the fate of arbitrarily large higher - dimensional zero - temperature ising systems .",
    "our simulations indicate that the system with zero initial magnetization reaches a stripe state with a non - zero probability as @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ stripe ] ) .",
    "linear extrapolation of the last 4 data points for the probability of reaching the stripe state , @xmath51 , versus @xmath3 gives @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the square and triangular lattices , respectively .",
    "= 2.8in0.0 in 0.25 in    the stripe state can contain an arbitrary even number of stripes .",
    "for the square system , we typically obtain two stripes of similar widths .",
    "metastable states with more than two stripes appear very rarely .",
    "for example , the probability of reaching the four - stripe state grows very slowly with @xmath3 and is less than @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "we can gain a qualitative understanding for the dependence of the probability of obtaining @xmath56 vertical stripes in the final state , @xmath57 , by analyzing a general rectangular system of size @xmath58 with fixed aspect ratio @xmath59 ( and taking the @xmath4 limit as usual ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath60 and @xmath61 the final probabilities @xmath57 are approximately 0.0028 , 0.101 , 0.35 , 0.36 , and 0.15 , for @xmath62 . there is also a probability approximately 0.034 that a horizontal stripe forms . in general",
    ", the probability @xmath57 appears to be peaked around @xmath63 . invoking the natural assumption of analyticity in @xmath59",
    "then implies that the probabilities @xmath57 of @xmath56-stripe states are positive for all ( even ) @xmath56 and arbitrary aspect ratio @xmath59 .",
    "our data are insufficient to probe the @xmath56-dependence of @xmath57 but qualitatively @xmath57 decays faster than exponentially .",
    "this behavior seems to be similar to that of the number of spanning clusters on the rectangles of fixed shape at the percolation threshold . in that problem , a wide consensus that only one spanning cluster exists has been recently disproved by numerical@xcite and theoretical@xcite evidence .",
    "we now employ an argument similar to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of spanning clusters to estimate the large-@xmath56 behavior of @xmath57 .",
    "specifically , we consider the probability @xmath64 to reach a state with @xmath56 _ horizontal _ stripes ( all @xmath56 stripes in the direction of the length @xmath65 ) .",
    "imagine now dividing the rectangle into two equal rectangles of size @xmath66 each . in the large-@xmath56 limit , the dominant contribution to @xmath64 comes from situations where approximately @xmath67 stripes traverse each of the rectangles .",
    "this implies @xmath68 ^ 2,\\ ] ] which may be iterated to give @xmath69^{k/2}.\\ ] ]    the quantity on the right - hand side @xmath70 is the probability to have a stripe which traverses a rectangle of dimension @xmath71 in the long direction .",
    "here we have assumed that the probabilities @xmath64 depend weakly on the system size @xmath3 and do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if we take @xmath72 as the width of the original rectangle , then the rectangle @xmath71 has a small finite width and a length of order @xmath73 .",
    "this rectangle is so narrow that a stripe can occur only if existed in the initial state .",
    "this clearly occurs with probability @xmath74 . by substituting @xmath75 into eq .",
    "( [ esti ] ) we deduce that @xmath76 thus @xmath57 has a gaussian tail .",
    "this explains why four and higher - stripe states are almost never seen in our simulations for the square system . in the following ,",
    "we always consider square ( or hypercubic ) systems .",
    "consider now an ising system with a small difference between the number of up and down spins .",
    "we study two basic quantities : ( i ) the probability @xmath77 that the minority phase wins , that is , the sign of the magnetization in the final ( ground ) state is opposite to that in the initial state , and ( ii ) the probability @xmath78 that the system reaches a stripe state .",
    "both these quantities exhibit scaling when @xmath3 diverges and the the initial magnetization @xmath79 vanishes such that the combination @xmath80 is kept constant . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the best data collapse is achieved with @xmath82 while for @xmath78 the best data collapse is achieved with @xmath83 .",
    "further , @xmath84 appears to be an exponentially decaying function of @xmath85 while @xmath86 appears to decay even more quickly ( fig .",
    "[ minwin2d ] ) .",
    "the exponential behavior is not surprising in view of the analogy to the spanning probability in percolation .",
    "indeed , consider the extreme case case of percolation with @xmath87 .",
    "then a spanning cluster of the minority phase exists with probability @xmath88 , _",
    "i.  e. _ , it decays exponentially with system size .",
    "this argument makes it plausible that @xmath84 and @xmath86 also decay at least as fast as exponentially with @xmath3 and thence with @xmath85 .",
    "0.3in=2.2in=2.2 in 0.25 in    overall we conclude that in two dimensions , the initial majority phase always wins in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath15 in two dimensions , just as in the mean - field limit .",
    "this suggests that @xmath12 may well be a step function for all spatial dimensions @xmath49 when @xmath89 .",
    "it is also instructive to investigate the effect of a finite external magnetic field @xmath90 on the fate of the system . in two dimensions",
    "there are two distinct field ranges : ( i ) weak fields @xmath91 , and ( ii ) strong fields @xmath92 .",
    "a weak field modifies the dynamics of spins which have two misaligned neighbors . in zero field",
    "such spins flip with rate 1/2 , while in a weak field they can only flip parallel to the field .",
    "this means , for example , that kinks on interfaces move in only one direction rather than diffusing ( fig .",
    "[ kink ] ) . for strong fields , down spins which have 3 misaligned neighbors can now flip parallel to the field and the system ends up in the field - aligned ground state .",
    "= 0.25 in 0.8 in 0.15 in    the most interesting case is that of weak field and a small initial concentration of up spins , where the system consists of small clusters of up spins in a background of down spins . due to",
    "the unidirectional kink motion on interfaces , clusters of up spins can grow until each fills out its convex hull ( fig .",
    "[ expansion ] ) .",
    "if the convex hull of one cluster overlaps with either another up cluster ( or its convex hull ) , then the resulting aggregate can expand further to fill out this enlarged convex hull .",
    "if there is yet another cluster ( or convex hull ) within this expansion zone , growth continues .",
    "= 1.6 in 0.7 in 0.15 in    this growth process is essentially the same as bootstrap percolation @xcite , in which a lattice is randomly occupied , say with initial density @xmath93 , and then all sites that do not have at least @xmath94 occupied neighbors are removed .",
    "this deletion step is then repeated until no more sites can be removed .",
    "the case @xmath19 is essentially identical to our weak - field system , with spins antiparallel to the field playing the role of occupied sites in bootstrap percolation . in @xmath19 bootstrap percolation , all occupied sites",
    "will eventually be removed for @xmath4 , even if @xmath93 is arbitrarily close to 1 . translating this to the ising system ,",
    "we conclude that for any non - zero concentration of up spins , the system will evolve to the ground state with @xmath95 in the thermodynamic limit .        on the simple cubic lattice",
    ", the probability to reach the ground state , @xmath96 , decreases rapidly with the system size ( fig .",
    "[ final ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "perhaps even more surprising is that the final state of the system for large @xmath3 is _ not _ geometrically static !",

    "the up and down spins percolate in all three coordinate directions in the final state .",
    "for example , for cubes with @xmath100 , 30 and 40 , the probability that both phases percolate in all three directions equals 0.83 , 0.92 and 0.97 respectively .",

    "= 1.3in0.9 in 0.15 in    to visualize these percolating spin clusters , consider each spin as occupying a unit cube .",
    "a cluster must then have no convex corners to be stable ( fig .",
    "[ 3-arm ] ) ; a spin at such a corner can flip freely and generate additional convex corners . the generic configuration which permits two clusters of oppositely - oriented spins , each devoid of convex corners , to percolate in all three directions",
    "has the form of two interpenetrating 3-arm stars ( fig .",
    "[ 3-arm ] ) .",
    "each arm is oriented along one coordinate direction and joins onto itself because of the periodic boundary condition , so that there are no convex corners .",

    "the shaded portion of fig .  [ blinkers ] supports a blinker .",
    "this blinker starts at the upper left corner of the shaded region of height @xmath101 , where it costs zero energy to flip the heavy shaded spin .",
    "once this spin flips , its three nearest neighbors ( two light shaded and one just above the dark - shaded spin in fig .",
    "[ blinkers ] ) can also flip with no energy cost . continuing this process",
    "gives rise to a fluctuating interface in the shaded parallelepiped that is bounded by the states of all spins up and all spins down .",

    "the ends of this segment are terminated by 5 additional chains with at least 4 spins in agreement for these chains .",
    "this segment is effectively a finite one - dimensional chain with the endpoints fixed to be in opposite states so that a blinker lives forever .",
    "amusingly , blinkers are much more prominent in the potts model with glauber kinetics , where they arise even in two dimensions .",

    ", metastable states must consist of long filamentary structures to avoid having any convex corners which serve as the nucleus for energy - lowering moves .",
    "this geometric constraint suggests that the degeneracy of all metastable states should be similar to that of the lower bound filamentary states .",
    "thus we expect that @xmath152 .",
    "to probe an infinite spatial dimension , we estimate the number of metastable states by considering the cayley tree .",
    "there is already a subtlety which depends on whether the coordination number of the tree is even or odd .",
    "while odd - coordinated lattice systems exhibit the pathology of metastable freezing for any initial magnetization , even - coordinated trees naturally give rise to blinker states , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "= 2.8 in 0.1 in 0.15 in    for simplicity we consider the 3-coordinated tree with root at level @xmath153 ( fig .  [ tree ] ) .",
    "two nodes in level @xmath154 are attached to the root site , then four nodes form level @xmath155 , _ etc_. to enumerate the total number of metastable states @xmath156 on an @xmath153-level tree",
    "we first note that there are two types of spins in any metastable state . for a spin at level @xmath94 ,",
    "if the two daughter spins in level @xmath157 agree , then the state of the parent spin is uniquely determined .",
    "conversely , if the daughters disagree , then the state of the spin in level @xmath94 ( circled in fig .  [ tree ] ) is determined by that of its parent in level @xmath158 .",
    "( the neighboring spins at level 0 must agree . )",
    "let @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the respective number of metastable states with the root spin determined and undetermined by its daughters .",
    "then by enumerating all possible daughter states and the outcome of the root site , @xmath159 and @xmath160 obey the recursion relations @xmath161 subject to the initial conditions @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "for example , the recurrence ( [ recb ] ) expresses the fact that the root spin is undetermined only when two daughter spins are uniquely determined and of opposite sign .",
    "thus @xmath164 , where the factor @xmath165 takes into account that the root spin remains undetermined and the factor @xmath166 ensures that the root spins in the daughter trees are opposite .    by computing the first few terms in these recursion formulae , we see that @xmath160 and @xmath159 grow very rapidly with @xmath153 .",
    "to probe the asymptotic behavior of @xmath160 and @xmath159 , we divide eq .",
    "( [ reca ] ) by @xmath167 and use eq .",
    "( [ recb ] ) to find the following recursion for @xmath168 : @xmath169 the recurrence ( [ lambdarecur ] ) for @xmath170 iterates the rational function @xmath171 whose fixed points , @xmath172 , are @xmath123 and @xmath173 . only the positive fixed point @xmath174 is physically acceptable .",
    "this is also an attractive fixed point as @xmath175 , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath176 .",
    "thus , @xmath177 and hence @xmath178 to determine @xmath159 we iterate @xmath179 to give @xmath180 this equation implies that the following limit @xmath181 exists and equals @xmath182 from eqs .",
    "( [ reca])([recb ] ) with initial conditions @xmath162 and",
    "@xmath163 , we obtain @xmath183 and @xmath184 . using these values and the recurrence ( [ lambdarecur ] )",
    "we numerically determine @xmath185 .",
    "equation ( [ defdelta ] ) gives @xmath186 but we can also find the overall amplitude . from eqs .",
    "( [ dn ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) we find the exact expression for the ratio @xmath187 now we recall that @xmath188 and thus the product on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) approaches to @xmath189 as @xmath190 .",
    "this together with eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) yields @xmath191 these results should be compared to the total number of the spin states @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the total number of sites in the @xmath153-level tree of coordination number 3 .",
    "note also that the `` entropy '' of the total number of metastable states , @xmath194 , asymptotically grows as @xmath195 , with @xmath196 .",
    "the linear @xmath197-dependence fits with the previous lower bound according to which the metastable state entropy increases as @xmath198 in @xmath33 dimensions .",
    "for a system which is quenched from infinite to a low but non - zero temperature , the equilibrium state is eventually reached . however , we find that the approach to equilibrium proceeds in two distinct stages . in the initial coarsening stage ,",
    "the evolution is essentially the same as that of the zero temperature case . in two dimensions , for example",
    ", the system first relaxes to a metastable stripe state with probability @xmath0 . at zero temperature , this would be the final state of the system .",
    "however , at finite temperature , there is a relatively slow escape from this metastable state whose rate we now determine by a simple geometric approach .",
    "-0.1in=3.3 in 0.0 in 0.15 in    a stripe is formed in a time of order @xmath132@xcite . at a small positive temperature ,",
    "a stripe can disappear by the annihilation of the two domain walls ( fig .",
    "[ dent ] ) .",
    "this annihilation occurs by the following steps : first , a dent is created by flipping a spin at a domain wall .",
    "the time required for this event is of the order of @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the energy cost associated with the spin flip .",
    "once a dent is created , the spin in the dent , as well its two vertical neighbors , are now free to flip .",
    "thus the length of the dent performs a one - dimensional random walk until the horizontal boundaries meet .    now using elementary facts about the first passage of a one - dimensional random walk in the presence of an absorbing boundary@xcite , the dent recombines with probability @xmath201 and the domain wall returns to its original state , or with probability @xmath141 the dent expands and changes the sign of one column of spins .",
    "thus we need @xmath3 dent creation events before the interface of the strip hops rigidly by @xmath202 in the @xmath104-direction .",
    "the time needed for this hop is therefore of the order of @xmath203 .",
    "since the typical width of a stripe is of the order of @xmath3 , there must typically be @xmath132 such interface hopping events before the two interfaces meet and thus surmount the metastable barrier . as a result ,",
    "the time for a stripe state to disappear is of the order of @xmath204 .",
    "our simulations are in excellent agreement with this prediction for @xmath205 ( fig .",
    "[ nonzerot ] ) . here the time to reach the equilibrium is defined as the time for the system to first reach the equilibrium value of the magnetization of the ising model on the square lattice at temperature @xmath206 .",
    "this stopping time is dominated by configurations which first reach a stripe state ; configurations which relax directly to the equilibrium state reach this state quickly .",
    "0.4in=2.0 in 0.25 in    we can develop a similar argument in three dimensions .",
    "since a typical metastable state has the form of two interpenetrating 3-arm stars , let us estimate the time for such a structure to disappear .",
    "the lowest energy excitation is to flip a spin in one of the concave corners of this structure ( see fig .",
    "[ 3d - concave ] ) .",
    "this spin flip requires an energy of @xmath200 and thus takes a time of the order of @xmath207 . by flipping of the order of @xmath132",
    "such spins it is possible to create a planar barrier of one phase which spans the system , at which point the other phase can disappear with no additional energy cost .",
    "since the energy cost associated with the creation of this excitation is @xmath208 , this suggests that the time to surmount the metastable barrier scales as @xmath209 , a time which is too long to probe directly by simulations .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of a finite ising system with glauber kinetics when it is suddenly quenched from infinite to zero temperature . in two dimensions",
    "there appears to be a non - zero probability that the system ultimately reaches a frozen metastable state which consists of two or more parallel straight stripes .",
    "while our simulations suggest that the probability of reaching a stripe state is positive even as @xmath4 , and we have a heuristic argument that @xmath56-stripe states occur with positive probability for every even @xmath56 , we do not have a rigorous argument to support this observation .",
    "this is a fundamental unanswered question .    in three and higher spatial dimensions , the probability that system reaches either the ground state or a frozen state",
    "is vanishingly small .",
    "essentially all realizations end up wandering forever on connected iso - energy sets of blinker states .",
    "it is easy to visualize these blinkers on a even - coordinated cayley tree as well as on a small - size cubic lattice .",
    "however , we do not have a good way to characterize these blinkers for large finite - dimensional systems .",
    "the existence of blinkers means that the kinetic ising - glauber system in sufficiently large spatial dimensions belongs to type @xmath18 according to the classification of newman and stein@xcite .",
    "that is , some fraction of the spins flip infinitely often ( those on blinkers ) , while the rest of the spins flip a finite number of times .",
    "one reason for the system not reaching the ground state is that metastable states become more numerous as the spatial dimension increases .",
    "the number of these metastable states appears to scale as @xmath210 in @xmath33 dimensions , where @xmath197 is the total number of spins .",
    "this makes it plausible that a spin system is more likely to first encounter and get trapped in a metastable state before the ground state can be reached .",
    "associated with the metastable states are a variety of interesting geometric features of the final state , such as the distribution of magnetization and the distribution of energy .",
    "many features of these distributions are still unexplained .    at low temperature ,",
    "the ising - glauber system necessarily reaches equilibrium , but via a two - stage relaxation process .",
    "initially , the kinetics is nearly identical to that of the zero - temperature case . for the subset of systems which reach a metastable stripe state in two dimensions",
    ", there is then a slow approach to equilibrium by the nucleation of defects which cause the stripe boundaries to diffuse , ultimately merge , and thus disappear . because this kinetics is an activated process , the time to relax to equilibrium is extremely slow .",
    "surprisingly , this two - stage picture persists for temperatures up to approximately @xmath21 in two dimensions .",
    "a similar two - stage picture appears to hold in higher dimensions .",
    "however , the time scales associated with surmounting metastable barriers and ultimately reaching the ground state are astronomically long .",
