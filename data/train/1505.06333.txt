    "equation   offers the following physical interpretation : at any instant of time @xmath94 , the finite loop inductance modifies the external flux @xmath17 piercing the squid , and the resulting total magnetic flux @xmath95 has to be evaluated self - consistently .",
    "once this is done , the dynamics of the squid phase @xmath96 [ as well as the total voltage drop across the device @xmath2 ] can be evaluated via eq .  .",

    "from this expression we see that unless the difference between @xmath102 and @xmath103 is large ( i.e. , comparable to @xmath90 ) the term @xmath104 is a minor correction to the magnetic flux , with respect to @xmath105 .    in order to quantify the effect of the inductance , we have solved numerically the rcsj - equation   for an array of 50 symmetric ( @xmath31 ) squids made of nb / alox / nb junctions  @xcite , and computed the voltage pulses for different values of the loop geometrical inductance , compatible with typical squid dimensions .    in fig .",

    "we see that the principal effect of increasing @xmath90 is that the voltage pulses are delayed with respect to the @xmath111 case , and furthermore they are sharper and higher .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the change in the time - dependent magnetic flux profile . indeed , starting at @xmath35 , it turns out that @xmath95 is initially reduced by virtue of the second term in eq .  .",

    "[ sec : results ] , this @xmath10 scaling is not a limitation in the region of tens of ghz , where sizable output power can be generated .",
    "conversely at higher frequency , e.g. sub - millimeter region , the output power drops and the device design must be modified to compensate for this decrease .",
    "one possibility is to operate with more jrcg arrays arranged in a parallel configuration : in this case the contribution @xmath138 of each jrcg array would add up and the total power would be given by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the number of squid arrays in parallel .",
    "another important issue concerns the way the emitted radiation propagates across the device . when discussing the scaling of the power with the number @xmath10 of squids in the chain , we have implicitly assumed such radiation to propagate _",
    "instantly _ across the device . strictly speaking",
    ", this lumped - element model is justified if the propagation time @xmath157 of the radiation through the whole array is much shorter than the typical voltage pulse width , i.e. the voltage transient .",
    "this condition strongly depends on the specific values of the parameters , which in turn are set by the device fabrication , its design , and the materials used .",
    "all these can be optimized with the aim of decreasing the propagation time @xmath157 . in any case , this lumped model approximation does by no means set any sharp boundary condition on the working operation of the device . even if @xmath157 was not",
    "shorter , but rather comparable with the voltage transient , the only consequence would be that the interference effects shall be taken into account .",
    "but since the device generates _ all _ the harmonics of the fundamental frequency , some of them will be partially attenuated because of destructive interference , some others will be ( almost ) unchanged because of constructive interference . therefore the output signal may be attenuated at some specific frequencies , remaining unchanged at the others , but the device would still work and can be used if the specific output frequency we want to extract has enough output power .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : squid_nb_realistic_power_nu1 ] we show the estimated power spectrum generated by a single _ realistic _ array of @xmath69 squids made of nb / alox / nb josephson junctions . by `` realistic '' we mean subject to the fabrication errors discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : results_areas ] and [ sec : results_asymmetries ] , having random ( normally distributed ) areas _ and _ asymmetry parameters .",
    "furthermore , we assume them to have a finite loop geometrical inductance @xmath158 ph ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results_inductance ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we do not consider any corrections due to their finite junction capacitance since we showed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_capacitance ] that they were completely negligible .",
    "from the figure , we notice that this device is still able to provide an output power of about 0.1 nw around 20 ghz ( corresponding to the 20-th harmonics of the driving frequency , see the corresponding black arrow ) .",
    "if we compare this to the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : squid_nb_inductance_power_nu1 ] , we notice that the power in this frequency range is only slightly reduced , as a consequence of the errors on the areas and the asymmetry parameters . a larger deterioration of the performance - of about two orders of magnitude - is otherwise expected at higher frequency ( around @xmath135 ghz , see the corresponding black arrow ) .",
    "nevertheless , the device is still able to produce an output power between @xmath159 and @xmath1 pw in this range , which can be relevant for several applications .",
    "all these considerations enforce the message that if the squids of the array can be fabricated with an accuracy of the order of @xmath14 on the areas and of @xmath15 on the asymmetry between the junctions , the expected performance is not altered significantly with respect to the ideal situation for frequencies around @xmath136 ghz .",
    "= 10 ph , and standard deviations @xmath121=0.01 and @xmath151=0.005 on the areas and the asymmetry parameter , respectively ( the latter centered around @xmath150 ) .",
    "the calculation is performed for a @xmath115 chain of nb / alox / nb squids subject to a @xmath44=1 ghz driving .",
    "blue and red symbols represent the odd and even harmonics , respectively , whereas the black arrows emphasize the frequency ranges around @xmath136 ghz and @xmath135 ghz . ]    finally , we stress that all our analysis has been carried out at zero temperature , being more focused on the fabrication parasitic effects .",
    "the effects of thermal noise were indeed already addressed in ref .   for a similar setup made of yttrium barium copper oxide ( ybco ) josephson junctions . in that case",
    "it was shown that its contribution was basically negligible , the signal to noise ratio being of the order of @xmath160 at a temperature of @xmath161 k. hence , we do not expect a finite temperature to alter significantly the results presented in this paper .",
    "in summary , we have discussed extensively several parasitic effects on the working operation of the squid - based radiation comb generator originally proposed in ref .  . under certain conditions",
    ", we found that taking into account the finite loop geometrical inductance of the squids has a beneficial impact on the device performance , whereas the fabrication errors ( uncertainties in the squids areas and asymmetries ) tend to decrease it .",
    "also , in the range of parameters considered , we showed that a finite junction capacitance does not alter the results , meaning that the device operates always in the overdamped regime .",
    "+ when all these effects are taken into account at once , we have estimated that a realistic array of @xmath69 squids made of nb / alox / nb junctions is able to deliver a power of @xmath162 nw around 20 ghz , and of @xmath163 pw around 100 ghz , to a standard load resistance of 50 ohm .",
    "this may opens interesting perspectives in the realm of quantum information technology .",
    "+ the device has room for optimization by modeling the geometry of the single junctions , the fabrication materials , the driving signal and the array design .",
    "for instance , besides squids made of tunneling junction considered in this work , one may investigate devices made of weak - link superconductor - normal metal - superconductor sns junctions , such as nb / hfti / nb josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "+ finally , the discussed implementation would have the advantage to be built on - chip and integrated in low - temperature superconducting microwave electronics  @xcite .",

    "to test the performance of this radiation generator , we have calculated the power spectrum @xmath138 vs frequency @xmath164 . to this goal , first we have computed the fourier transform of the voltage v()=_0^tdte^it v(t ) . the power spectral density ( psd )",
    "is then @xmath165 .",
    "finally , the power @xmath138 is calculated by integrating the psd around the resonances @xmath166 ( where @xmath44 is the monochromatic driving frequency ) and dividing for a standard load resistance of 50 ohm .",
    "this is the power we would measure at a given resonance frequency with a bandwidth exceeding the linewidth of the resonance .",
    "to study the dynamics of the squid phase @xmath47 in sec .",

    "in order to estimate the effects of imperfections in the squids fabrication , we have followed a statistical approach .",
    "we describe here the procedure adopted in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_areas ] , the one in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_asymmetries ] being equivalent .    given a certain value of the standard deviation @xmath121 ,",
    "we have sampled an interval of width @xmath174 by introducing a number of bins @xmath175 .",
    "we have then solved the rcsj dynamics   for @xmath175 values of @xmath176 [ corresponding to @xmath175 values of areas @xmath177 , according to eq .  ]",
    "taken as the centers of each bin . the computed voltage versus",
    "time @xmath178 has been stored aside .    at this stage , to simulate the dynamics of an array , we have generated @xmath10=50 values of @xmath118 taken from a random gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath121 , and to each one of these we have associated the voltage @xmath178 corresponding to the closest value of @xmath176 , calculated and stored previously .    for an array of @xmath10 squids , under the hypothesis of independent squid dynamics ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : feasibility ] ) the total voltage is simply the sum of all the voltages generated by each squid : v_(t)=_i=1^n v_i(t ) . indeed",
    "the presence of the load , and the fact that it effectively couples the dynamics of the squids , has been taken into account by substituting the shunt resistance @xmath7 with @xmath179 in the rcsj equation , as discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "finally , this procedure has been iterated for a relatively large ( @xmath180=10000 ) number of realizations of different arrays , and the typical voltage of an array has been defined as : v_(t)=_j v^(j)(t ) , where the index @xmath181 labels the @xmath182-th realization of an array .",
    "we have done this , instead of simulating the dynamics of _ all _ the squids of _ each _ array many times , in order to reduce the computational burden , otherwise enormous .",
