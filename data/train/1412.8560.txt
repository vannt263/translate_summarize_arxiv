    "the quantum rabi model ( qrm ) describes a two - level system ( qubit ) coupled to a cavity electromagnetic mode ( an oscillator )  @xcite , a minimalist paradigm of matter - light interactions with applications in numerous fields ranging from quantum optics to quantum information science and condensed matter physics .",
    "its hamiltonian reads , @xmath2 the pauli matrices @xmath3 describe the two - level system and @xmath4,(@xmath5 ) denote the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the bosonic mode .",
    "simple as it appears , the solution of the qrm is nontrivial and it was not clear whether it can be obtained analytically .",
    "recently it was shown that the qrm is not only exactly solvable but integrable  @xcite , using bargmann - space methods  @xcite .",
    "a function @xmath6 was derived , whose zeros yield the so - called regular spectrum , i.e. @xmath7 entails @xmath8 .",
    "this @xmath0-function can be written explicitly in terms of confluent heun functions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 was then recovered with the simpler formalism of extended coherent states  @xcite .",
    "these results have stimulated extensive research in the qrm and related models  twophoton , moroz , gardas , braak2013,maciejewski , zhong , wang2014,fanheng , tomka , peng , chilingaryan , chennext , batchelor .",
    "it is well known in quantum optics  @xcite that two - mode squeezed states are important since several devices produce correlated light at two frequencies . recently , a quantum memory for light , a key element for the realization of future quantum information networks , was constructed employing a set of displaced two - mode squeezed states with an unconditionally high fidelity that exceeds the classical benchmark  memory .",
    "two - mode squeezed states have been prepared also in cavity optomechanics via reservoir engineering  @xcite .",
    "there are many hints to potential applications of a single qubit coupled simultaneously to two different light modes in quantum information technology , e.g. for the implementation of fast beam splitters  @xcite .",
    "such a system may also be realized in various solid state devices  sillanpaa,2qubits , dicalo , and especially in circuit qed  @xcite .",
    "one analytically tractable form of the two - mode generalization of the qrm couples the qubit bilinearly to the two cavity modes , thereby creating squeezed states .",
    "this model will be studied in the next section .",
    "we derive a @xmath0-function in analogy to the single - mode case and obtain regular and exceptional spectra analytically .",
    "most important , we can derive the overall features of the spectrum from the pole structure of the @xmath0-function alone , without the need for numerical evaluation , and explain in this way the collapse of the discrete spectrum to a continuum which happens in this model as in the qrm with quadratic coupling to a single mode  twophoton , collapse .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - mode qrm  @xcite reads , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is coupling strength and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operators for the quantized fields in two cavities @xmath13 .",
    "the energy scale is defined by setting @xmath14 .",

    "accordingly , there exist infinitely many invariant subspaces @xmath23 labeled by the eigenvalue @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "confinement to a single @xmath23 effectively eliminates one of the bosonic modes . conforming to the usual terminology  @xcite",
    ", we set @xmath26 and call @xmath1 the bargmann index of @xmath27 . in the following we consider @xmath28 ( @xmath29 exchanges modes 1 and 2 ) , i.e. @xmath1 runs over positive multiples of 1/2 . besides the continuous symmetry acting only in the bosonic subspace , @xmath22 possesses also a discrete symmetry @xmath30 which takes the form @xmath31 .",
    "we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath30 generates therefore a @xmath34-symmetry ( parity ) .",
    "it has eigenvalues @xmath35 , entailing a further decay of @xmath36 into two invariant subspaces @xmath37 , labeled by the parity quantum number .",
    "these two symmetries together render the two - mode qrm integrable according to the level - labeling criterion  @xcite .    _ bogoliubov transformations : _ in analogy to the two - photon qrm  chen2012",
    ", we may perform a bosonic bogoliubov transformation to new operators @xmath38 , @xmath39 , which in the present case mixes the two modes , @xmath40 the @xmath41 satisfy bosonic commutation relations if @xmath42 . because @xmath43 this transformation leaves each subspace @xmath36 invariant . with the choice @xmath44 where",
    "@xmath45 , the upper left block of the hamiltonian matrix becomes @xmath46 which no longer contains the squeezing terms .",

    "however , while the representation in the bargmann space provides a mathematically rigorous justification of the method in the latter case  @xcite , the present analysis using ess needs to be rederived by imposing the proper normalization conditions on the eigenstates of @xmath83 in the space @xmath36 , which will be the subject of future work .",

    "it is therefore possible to derive a @xmath0-function for the two - mode qrm based on continued fractions , which is equivalent to truncate the model on a finite - dimensional hilbert space  braak - contfrac .",
    "however , all qualitative information about the features of the spectrum is lost in this approach as the singularity structure of the continued fraction is not known . to the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath0-functions have known singularities as function of @xmath82 : one sees from eq .   that @xmath115 has a simple pole at @xmath116 and from we deduce that @xmath117 has simple poles at @xmath118  the @xmath119 , where @xmath112 vanishes , must be located in between these poles ; the number varies between zero and two , but",
    "because the poles are simple , there can be no adjacent intervals which are both devoid of zeros or contain both two zeros .",
    "this feature follows for @xmath120 from eq .  .",
    "the zeros of @xmath112 are therefore smoothly distributed between the equidistant poles , i.e. @xmath121 ( for fixed parity ) .",
    "the distance between poles of @xmath122 on the energy axis depends on @xmath10 : if @xmath123 , @xmath124 , we find for @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath10 approaches the critical value @xmath126 from below , the distance between the poles of @xmath127 goes to zero and it follows @xmath128 .",

    "the spacing between adjacent discrete energy levels vanishes and the spectrum becomes continuous - accordingly no normalizable states exist anymore .",
    "the number of bosonic excitations in low - lying states grows very fast in approaching the critical coupling  @xcite , which makes numerical diagonalization more and more difficult . in our approach",

    "for special values of the model parameters @xmath10 and @xmath131 , there are eigenvalues which do not correspond to zeros of @xmath132 ; the corresponding energy has the value @xmath133 .",
