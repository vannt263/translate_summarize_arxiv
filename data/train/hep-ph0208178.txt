    "a commonly considered candidate for the wimp is the lightest neutralino , provided it is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) @xcite in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "four neutralinos in the mssm , being mass eigenstates , are mixtures of the bino @xmath5 , wino @xmath6 and higgsinos @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the lsp can be written as a composition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the entries of the neutralino mixing matrix . in susy phenomenology one",

    "the lsp is stable due to r - parity conservation @xcite .",
    "the neutralino , being massive , neutral and stable , often provides a sizeable contribution to the relic density .",
    "the contribution of neutralinos to the relic density is strongly model dependent and varies by several orders of magnitude over the whole allowed parameter space of the mssm .",
    "the neutralino relic density then can impose stringent constraints on the parameters of the mssm and the susy particle spectrum , and may have important consequences both for studies of susy at colliders and in astroparticle experiments . in the light of this and",
    "taking into account the continuing improvements in determining the abundance of cdm and other components of the universe , which have now reached an unprecedented precision @xcite , one needs to perform an accurate enough computation of the wimp relic abundance , which would allow reliable comparison of theory with observation .",
    "important progress in calculations of the relic density of neutralinos in a variety of supersymmetric models has been already made .    in the early universe neutralinos existed in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic thermal plasma . as the universe expanded and cooled , the thermal energy is no longer sufficient to produce neutralinos at an appreciable rate , they decouple and their number density scales with co - moving volume .",
    "the sparticles significantly heavier than the lsp decouple at an earlier time and decay into lsps before the lsps themselves decouple .",
    "nevertheless there may exist some other next - to - lightest sparticles ( nlsps ) which are not much heavier than the stable lsp .",
    "the number densities of the nlsps have only slight boltzmann suppressions with respect to the lsp number density when the lsp freezes out of chemical equilibrium with the thermal bath",
    ". therefore they may still be present in the thermal plasma , and nlsp - lsp and nlsp - nlsp interactions keep the lsp in thermal equilibrium resulting in significant reduction of the lsp number density and leading to acceptable values even with a rather heavy sparticle spectrum @xcite .",
    "these _ coannihilation _",
    "processes can be particularly important when the lsp - lsp annihilation rate itself is suppressed @xcite . any susy particle can be involved in the coannihilation process provided its mass is almost degenerate with the mass of the lsp @xcite . in the low - energy effective mssm ( effmssm ) , where one ignores restriction from unification assumptions and investigates the mssm parameter space at the weak scale @xcite there is , in principle , no preference for the next - to - lightest susy particle .",
    "the relativistic thermal averaging formalism @xcite was extended to include coannihilation processes in @xcite , and was implemented in the darksusy code @xcite for coannihilation of charginos and heavier neutralinos . in",
    "was found @xcite that for higgsino - like lsp such a coannihilation significantly decreases the relic density and rules out these lsps from the region of cosmological interest .",
    "the importance of the neutralino coannihilation with sfermions was emphasized and investigated for sleptons @xcite , stops @xcite and sbottoms @xcite in the so - called constrained mssm ( cmssm ) @xcite or in supergravity ( msugra ) models @xcite .",
    "the most popular msugra model @xcite has a minimal set of parameters : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the universal scalar mass , @xmath16 is the universal gaugino mass and @xmath17 is the universal trilinear mass , all evaluated at @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values and @xmath20 is a higgs parameter of the superpotential .",
    "there are strong correlations of sfermion , higgs boson and gaugino masses in msugra originating from unification assumptions . in regions of the msugra parameter space",
    "where @xmath21 and @xmath22 were nearly degenerate ( at low @xmath15 ) , coannihilations could give rise to reasonable values of the relic density even at very large values of @xmath16 , at both low and high @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in addition , for large values of the parameter @xmath17 or for non - universal scalar masses , top or bottom squark masses could become nearly degenerate with the @xmath21 , so that squark coannihilation processes can become important as well @xcite . therefore due to slepton and squark coannihilation effects , the relic density can reach the cosmologically interesting range of @xmath23 .    the influence of coannihilation channels on the lsp proton scalar elastic cross sections was considered in supergravity and d - brain models in @xcite and in a msugra - like susy model for large @xmath19 ( only for stau coannihilations ) in @xcite .",
    "having in mind investigation of future prospects for direct and indirect detection of relict lsp we follow the most phenomenological view , not bounded by theoretical restrictions from sfermion / gaugino / higgs mass unifications , etc . to this end",
    "we need maximally general and accurate calculations of the relic density within the low - energy effective mssm scheme ( effmssm ) @xcite .",
    "the high - level tool for these calculations is the darksusy code @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the code calculates only neutralino with next neutralino(s ) and chargino coannihilations ( ncc ) , which is not sufficient , when neutralino - slepton coannihilation ( slc ) and neutralino - squark ( sqc ) coannihilation are claimed to be dominant .",
    "contrary to the majority of previous papers ( see for example @xcite ) , aimed mostly at discovery and demonstration of the importance or dominance of some specific coannihilation channels , our main goal is the investigation of the interplay between different coannihilation channels as well as their consequences for detection of cdm . to this end a comparative study of ncc and slc channels , exploration of relevant changes in the relic density and investigation of their consequences for detection of cdm particles were performed in the effmssm in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends our investigations @xcite to the neutralino - stop and neutralino - sbottom coannihilations and completes our consideration of the subject . for this purpose we combined our previuos code @xcite with the darksusy code @xcite and codes of @xcite , which allows for the first time comparative study of relevant coannihilation channels ( ncc , slc , sqc ) in the low - energy effmssm",
    "as free parameters in the effmssm , we use the gaugino mass parameters @xmath24 , the entries to the squark and slepton mixing matrices @xmath25 for the 1st and 2nd generations and @xmath26 for the 3rd generation , respectively ; the 3rd generation trilinear soft couplings @xmath27 ; the mass @xmath28 of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , the higgs superpotential parameter @xmath20 , and @xmath19 . to reasonably reduce the parameter space we assumed @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 and have fixed @xmath33 @xcite .",

    "the calculations of the neutralino - nucleon cross sections and direct and indirect detection rates follow the description given in @xcite .",

    "the maximum rd suppression factor for the ncc and slc channels is of the order of @xmath65 .",
    "almost the same maximal suppression is found for the squark coannihilation channels .",
    "these results depend on the experimental limits imposed on the second - lightest neutralino , chargino and slepton stop and sbottom masses .",
    "if there were no limits on their masses , the factor of relative rd reduction due to ncc could reach a maximum value of @xmath66 for models with @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the current experimental limits for @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are 8090@xmath72 @xcite , and therefore the critical lsp mass that enables non - negligible ncc , slc , and sqc contributions is also of the same order ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "( 100,110 ) ( -10,-58 )    from panel a ) of the figure one can conclude that stop ( up - going triangles ) and sbottom ( down - going triangles ) equally contribute to reduction of the rd due to coannihilations .",
    "the encircled symbols depict some kind of `` constructive '' reduction , when due to the coannihilations the relic density falls into the cosmologically interesting region @xmath74 .",

    "therefore for our random sampling in the effmssm the ncc , slc and sqc are indeed relevant ( @xmath75 ) for 24% of models if one assumes @xmath76 , and the ncc is indeed relevant for about 30% of models if this constraint is relaxed ( fig .",
