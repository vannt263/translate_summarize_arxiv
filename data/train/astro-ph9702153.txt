    "in a recent paper king , kolb & burderi ( 1996 ; hereafter kkb ) considered the question of which low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) should be transient according to the disk instability model .",
    "they concentrated mainly on systems with short orbital periods @xmath3 d , showing in particular that neutron ",
    "star systems required secondaries which were somewhat nuclear  evolved before mass transfer began if they were to be transient , while this requirement is much weaker for black  hole systems , so that most are likely to be transient at these periods . the neutron ",
    "star result implies a significant constraint on lmxb formation , which is discussed further by king & kolb ( 1997 ) .",
    "kkb also briefly discussed the occurrence of transients in longer ",
    "period lmxbs whose evolution is driven by the nuclear expansion of an evolved companion .",
    "they concluded that almost all of these systems should be transient ( their equations 6 and 7 ) . while this conclusion is essentially correct and in agreement with the observational data ,",
    "the need for a more exact discussion of long  period transients has been thrown into sharper relief by the recent work of king et al .",
    "this shows that lmxbs with evolved companions are potentially subject to a violent instability arising from irradiation of the companion by the accreting primary .",
    "if unquenched this instability would lead to super ",
    "eddington accretion rates and catastrophic evolution through a common  envelope phase to an ultrashort  period binary . observed lmxbs with evolved companions must therefore be protected against the instability .",
    "king et al . ( 1996 ) identify two ways in which this can happen : first , the companion may be shielded from the irradiation by an extensive accretion disk corona or some similar structure .",
    "second , and more commonly , the instability is quenched by the short duty cycles observed in soft x ",
    "ray transients .",
    "accordingly we examine here in more detail the possibility of transient behaviour in such systems . in particular",
    "we allow for the higher mass transfer rates implied by mass ratios close to unity , something neglected by kkb , but which can suppress transient behaviour .",
    "we assume throughout that the orbital periods are long enough ( @xmath4  d ) that nuclear  driven evolution always dominates over angular momentum loss by magnetic braking ( cf kkb and pylyser & savonije 1988a , b ) .",
    "we restrict our discussion to systems with a secondary mass @xmath5 where the giant donor has a degenerate helium core and is well  established on the first giant branch . hence our considerations ( and those of kkb ) do not apply to the black  hole transient gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the optical observations of orosz & bailyn ( 1996 ) show that the companion star is not one of the low  mass giants considered here but is instead in a very short  lived evolutionary phase ( crossing the hertzsprung gap ) .",
    "evidently this evolution does allow for phases of rather slow radius expansion , giving the low mass transfer rates required for transient behaviour , but a full evolutionary calculation is needed to check this .",
    "in this section we essentially follow the arguments of kkb and van  paradijs ( 1996 ) , with a few refinements which we shall discuss explicitly .",
    "the condition for a disk instability can be summarized as the requirement that some part of the disk should have a temperature below the hydrogen ionization temperature @xmath6 k. if a steady state exists in which all of the disk is above this temperature the instability will be suppressed .",
    "since the effective temperature @xmath7 in a steady  state accretion disk decreases outwards with distance @xmath8 from the central accretor as @xmath9 ( cf eqn . 9 below ) this suppression is hardest to achieve at the outer disk edge @xmath10 , and the condition @xmath11 defines a minimum accretion rate @xmath12 above which the disk will be steady .",
    "however in lmxbs , van  paradijs ( 1996 ) has emphasized the dominant importance of irradiation of the disk surface by the central accreting source , which produces an effective temperature @xmath13 given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the stefan  boltzmann constant , @xmath16 the albedo of the disk surface , and @xmath17 the local disk scale height .",
    "the factor @xmath18 measures the efficiency of conversion of potential energy into irradiating flux .",
    "this necessarily absorbs a number of unknown factors of order unity which arise from e.g.  limb darkening , the spectral energy distribution of the emergent flux , or the fact that the effective mass  radius relation of the accretor is not exactly known .",
    "hence we do not distinguish between the neutron star and the black hole case and set @xmath19 as in kkb .",
    "any contribution to @xmath18 from nuclear burning of the accreted matter is negligible ( @xmath20 ) for a neutron star , but need not be for a white dwarf .",
    "the last pair of factors on the rhs are typically @xmath21 constant ( see below ) .",
    "they represent @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the very shallow angle between the incident radiation from the central point source and the disk surface , assuming small @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . from ( [ e2.1 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath13 decreases only as @xmath26 , and so is likely to exceed @xmath27 at @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly we define a new ( lower ) critical accretion rate @xmath28 by the requirement @xmath29 to evaluate @xmath28 we assume that @xmath10 is about 70% of the primary s roche lobe radius @xmath30 . here",
    "we make the first refinement : in place of the paczyski ( 1971 ) formula for the latter quantity , which introduces an awkward logarithmic dependence , we use instead the fact that for mass ratios @xmath31 the ratio of primary and secondary roche lobes can be approximated to better than 5% by @xmath32 we now assume that @xmath33 is equal to the thermal  equilibrium radius @xmath34 of a ( sub)giant of core mass @xmath35 , using the approximate expression @xmath36 ( webbink , rappaport and savonije 1983 ; king 1988 ) . combining ( [ e2.1 ]  [ e2.4 ] )",
    "we find @xmath37 where we have used @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as in kkb .",
    "as long as the mass transfer rate @xmath40 is above the limit ( [ e2.5 ] ) disk accretion is always stable .",
    "hence @xmath41 is a necessary condition for a disk instability to occur",
    ". we can compare ( [ e2.5 ] ) with the mass transfer rate driven by nuclear evolution @xmath42 obtained by requiring the stellar radius to move in step with the roche lobe ( see webbink et al .",
    "1983 , or king 1988 ) ; here @xmath43 is the thermal equilibrium mass  radius index ( taken as zero in the two papers quoted ) and @xmath44 gives the corresponding roche lobe motion .",
    "this is an improvement on equation ( 7 ) of kkb , which implicitly assumed @xmath45 and thus took the factor @xmath46 as constant .",
    "as we shall see , mass ratios @xmath47 can raise @xmath40 significantly towards @xmath28 .",
    "we see from ( [ e2.5 ] , [ e2.6 ] ) that @xmath28 increases faster with @xmath35 than @xmath40 .",
    "thus disk accretion is unstable above a critical core mass @xmath48 the critical core mass is plotted against @xmath1 in figure  1 , with @xmath49 ( king et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath50 ( kkb ) for a neutron star ( @xmath51 ) and a black hole ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we also show the evolutionary tracks @xmath53 ( cf king 1988 ) .",
    "the companion star specified by a pair of values @xmath54 on fig .  1 would fill its roche lobe in a binary of orbital period @xmath55 given by @xmath56 as the dependence on @xmath1 is extremely weak we can regard @xmath55 as given purely by @xmath35 ; we mark the corresponding @xmath55values on the right  hand scale in fig .  1 .",
    "mass transfer in systems with a @xmath57 neutron star and a giant donor with mass @xmath58 is either dynamically or thermally unstable ; such systems would not appear as lmxbs ( cf .",
    "kalogera & webbink 1996 ) .",
    "there is no such limit for systems with more massive black hole accretors , so that the lower panel of fig .  1",
    "could easily be extended up to @xmath59 by obvious extrapolation of the curves shown .",
    "the same donor mass limits apply to systems with asymptotic giant ",
    "branch donor stars .",
    "these binaries have very long orbital periods ( several years ) and a much more complicated mass loss history ; the mass transfer rate is highly modulated by thermal pulses and the wind mass loss rate is substantial ( e.g.  pastetter & ritter 1989 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .  1 that all long  period black  hole lmxbs with donors on the first giant branch must be transient , as observed .",
    "we also see that in lmxbs with a neutron star primary , the disk can be stable if the companion mass is high enough , so that the system is close to thermally unstable mass transfer ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these two conclusions imply stringent constraints on the known persistent lmxbs with long orbital periods . these are currently sco x2 ( @xmath61  d , southwell et al . 1996 ) lmc x2 ( @xmath62  d ) , cyg x2 ( @xmath63  d ) , and v395 car = 2s0921 - 630 ( @xmath64  d , e.g. mason et al .",
    "1987 , although the claimed periodicity is disputed by krzeminski & kubiak 1991 ) . as x ",
    "ray irradiation of both the accretion disc and the companion star must dominate the optical emission the precise nature of the companions is not easily deduced from observation .",
    "however , we know that they must be evolved stars , since they must fill the roche lobe in a relatively wide binary . thus the low  mass subgiant evolution considered here gives the lowest possible companion mass . in this case figure  1 requires minimum companion masses @xmath0 for all four systems .",
    "this latter value is consistent with mason et al.s mass function for v395 car .",
    "if the secondary masses are close to this lower limit , all four systems must contain neutron stars rather than black holes ( this is already suspected for cyg x2 as it has shown evidence of x  ray bursts ) . in gro j1744 - 2844 ,",
    "the only known long ",
    "period neutron ",
    "star transient with accurately determined orbital period ( @xmath65  d ) , the small mass function @xmath66 found by finger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the low eccentricity strongly point to an evolved low  mass companion . from fig .",
    "1 we find a maximum secondary mass @xmath67 for the slope @xmath68 ( @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) . with @xmath51 and",
    "the above mass function this requires inclinations @xmath71 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath70 ) , respectively .",
    "figure  1 shows that all low  mass neutron ",
    "star systems ultimately become transient as @xmath1 is reduced . as is well known , the endpoint of the binary evolution of such systems ( when @xmath73 ) is a millisecond radio pulsar in a wide ( @xmath74 d ) orbit with a low  mass white dwarf , the remnant core of the ( sub)giant companion after envelope exhaustion .",
    "our result means that the spin rate of the pulsar at the end of the mass  transfer phase is determined by this transient phase , rather than in a system transferring mass steadily at the rate @xmath40 , as is usually assumed .",
    "combined with the prediction that all black  hole systems are transient , the prevalence of transients among neutron ",
    "star systems agrees with the fact that persistent systems are rather rare among long  period lmxbs ( e.g. van  paradijs 1995 ) .    from ( [ e2.6 ] )",
    "we see that even with the most extreme assumptions ( @xmath75 , corresponding to short orbital periods @xmath76 few days ) the mass transfer rate in lmxbs with evolved secondaries is @xmath77 . in transients essentially all of this mass must be accreted during outbursts . with typical transient duty cycles",
    "@xmath78 it follows that the outburst accretion rates must be at least @xmath79 , i.e. at or above the eddington limit for a @xmath57 neutron star . for larger @xmath35 ( longer orbital periods ) or shorter duty cycles the rates are still higher .",
    "these predictions agree with observations of transient outbursts ( e.g. v404 cyg had a peak outburst luminosity @xmath80 erg s@xmath81 , cf tanaka & lewin 1995 ; king 1993 ) .",
    "the arguments above apply to disks where irradiation is dominant in determining the surface temperature of the disk .",
    "if irradiation does not act upon the disk surface , as e.g. in cvs , we must replace ( [ e2.1 ] ) by the standard effective temperature for a steady disk powered by local viscous dissipation ( e.g. frank , king & raine 1992 ) @xmath82 for mass transfer driven by nuclear evolution we follow the same steps as in section 2 , and find a new critical core mass ( independent of the nature of the primary ) @xmath83    the lowest value of @xmath35 possible in the nuclear  driven evolution we are considering is @xmath84 .",
    "thus except for thermally unstable mass transfer ( @xmath85 ) , the critical value of @xmath35 given by ( [ e3.2 ] ) is so small that we expect unirradiated disk accretion to be unstable in any system with an evolved low  mass companion .    since white dwarfs can not exceed the chandrasekhar limit , mass transfer stability demands low  mass companions .",
    "we conclude that all long  period cvs should be dwarf novae , while the supersoft sources ( thought to be undergoing thermal  timescale mass transfer , cf .",
    "e.g.  distefano & nelson 1996 ) can have stable disks .",
    "the only two known cvs at long enough orbital periods for our considerations to apply , namely v1017 sgr ( @xmath86  d ) and gk per ( @xmath87  d ) are both observed to have dwarf nova outbursts . for lmxbs we would conclude that unirradiated steady disks are impossible for long orbital periods .",
    "the fact that persistent systems are nevertheless observed at such periods ( see section 2 ) shows that irradiation must effectively determine the surface disk temperatures in these systems , and presumably most or all lmxbs .",
    "we have shown that stable disk accretion is very rare among lmxbs and cvs with evolved companions on the first giant branch .",
    "apart from a few systems ( such as sco x1 , cf kkb ) with short enough orbital periods that magnetic braking dominates nuclear evolution , it is confined ( at best ) to the early part of neutron ",
    "star binary evolution , i.e. systems with quite large secondary masses @xmath1 , and some of the supersoft white  dwarf x  ray sources . all long",
    " period cvs and black  hole systems with donors on the first giant branch , as well as most neutron ",
    "star systems at these periods , have unstable disks and appear as dwarf novae or soft x  ray transients .",
    "these conclusions are in excellent agreement with observation , and strongly support the view ( van  paradijs 1996 ) that x  ray irradiation determines the disk temperatures in most if not all lmxbs .",
    "since the neutron  star transients will ultimately produce millisecond pulsars it is clear that any claims of possible discrepancies between the numbers of the latter and those of their lmxb progenitors ( at least in the galactic disk ) must deal with the complex selection effects involved in the discovery of transients .",
    "further , all millisecond pulsars in long  period detached binaries must have descended from transients , and this must be considered in trying to work out their spin histories .    even when the stringent conditions ( cf fig .",
    "1 and section 2 ) for steady disk accretion are met , persistent lmxbs still have somehow to suppress the violent instability resulting from irradiation of an evolved companion ( king et al .",
    "1996 ) . since one can not invoke transient behaviour ( by definition ) , these systems must shield the companion from this radiation in some way , probably by means of an accretion disk corona .",
    "we note that the presence of such coronae is inferred in cyg x2 and v395 car , and that indeed none of the persistent lmxbs where the period is known or suspected to be long is observed to have a clear star  by  star eclipse .",
    "this supports the idea that accretion disk coronae do not merely make it impossible to observe eclipsing sources , but are essential to the survival of the systems themselves .",
