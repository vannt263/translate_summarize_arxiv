    "the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak interactions based on the gauge group @xmath2 has proven to be successful in describing all the available precision experimental data @xcite .",
    "this applies particularly to the predictions for the couplings of the gauge bosons to the matter fermions .",
    "the recent measurements of the gauge - boson self couplings at lepii @xcite and tevatron @xcite collider also shed some light on the correctness of the sm predictions for these interactions .    on the other hand , the precise mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking still remains one of the most important open questions of the theory . in the sm ,",
    "the breaking is realized via the higgs mechanism in which a scalar @xmath3-doublet , the higgs boson , is introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ and the symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field . however , in this simple realization , the theory presents problems since the running higgs mass shows a quadratic divergence at some high scale .",
    "this may imply the existence of a cut - off scale @xmath4 above which new physics must appear .    the experiments which will take place at the next linear electron ",
    "positron collider ( nlc ) will be able to explore the nature of the higgs boson and its couplings to other particles @xcite .",
    "deviations from the sm predictions for these couplings would indicate the existence of new physics effects .",
    "in general , such deviations can be parametrized in terms of effective lagrangians by adding to the sm lagrangian higher dimensional operators that describe the new phenomena @xcite . this model ",
    "independent approach accounts for new physics that shows up at an energy scale @xmath4 , larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "the effective lagrangians are constructed with the light particle spectrum that exists at low energies , while the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "they are invariant under the @xmath2 and , in the linearly realized version , they involve , in addition to the usual gauge  boson fields , also the light higgs particle .",
    "the most general dimension6 effective lagrangian , containing all sm bosonic fields , that is @xmath5 and @xmath6 even , was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    out of the eleven independent operators constructed in ref.@xcite , three of them describe new interaction between the higgs particle and the photon , @xmath7 where , in the unitary gauge",

    "the possible existence of heavy fermions and/or bosons , that couple to the ( light ) bosonic sector of the sm , should indirectly manifest itself in the higgs boson couplings via equation ( [ lagrangian ] ) , after all the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "anomalous higgs boson couplings have already been studied in higgs and z boson decays @xcite , in @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , and @xmath15 colliders @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the consequence of new operators that give rise to an anomalous higgs boson coupling to photons ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in particular , we study the anomalous production of the higgs boson via two - photon processes in a electron - positron collider , with the subsequent decay of the higgs boson into two particles .",
    "it is important to notice that we have also taken into account the sm one  loop higgs contributions @xcite to this vertex in our analyses .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",

    "the effective couplings @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are related to the coefficients of the operators appearing in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath16 coupling one has , @xmath27    considering only the effect of one operator at a time and combining information from precision measurements at lepi and at low energy , one has the following constraints at 95% cl ( in units of tev@xmath28 ) @xcite , for @xmath29 gev and @xmath30 gev , @xmath31    anomalous higgs boson production via vector boson fusion can be also generated by the anomalous couplings @xmath17  @xmath19 and @xmath18 of eq .",

    "the sm background considered for these reactions can be divided in two groups :    * set i : all the sm direct contribution for @xmath35 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ; * set ii : the vector boson fusion contributions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "in the case of a high energy electron - positron collider , virtual gauge bosons can be produced nearly on  shell and collinear with the initial particles . if one uses the effective boson approximation @xcite one may regard the fermion beams as sources of gauge bosons and at leading log ignore the virtuality of these bosons in calculating the cross section .",
    "the process @xmath44 , where both @xmath45 and @xmath46 serve as source of a vector boson , can be evaluated by the effective boson approximation formula @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the vector boson helicities . if one writes the elementary coupling between the fermions and the vector boson as @xmath52 with @xmath53 one obtains the following distribution function : @xmath54 where @xmath55 \\left[\\frac{2(1-x)\\xi}{w^2 x } - \\frac{2\\delta(2-w)}{w^3 } \\log \\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta'}\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ h_1 & = & \\left [ \\frac{x}{16 \\pi^2 } \\right ] \\left[\\frac{-(1-x)(2-w)}{w^2}+\\frac{(1-w)(\\xi - w^2)}{w^3}\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta'}\\right ) -\\frac{\\xi-2xw}{w^3}\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ h_2 & = & \\left [ \\frac{x}{16 \\pi^2 } \\right ] \\left[\\frac{-(1-x)(2-w)}{w^2(1-w)}+\\frac{\\xi}{w^3}\\log \\left(\\frac{x}{\\delta'}\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "this approach will be used to evaluate the vector boson fusion background ( set ii ) described in section [ introduction ] .",
    "for a high energy electron - positron collider , two - photon processes can be calculated using an effective photon approximation @xcite so that if a cross section @xmath60 is known , the cross section for @xmath61 via the two photon mechanism is given by : @xmath62 ^ 2   \\int_0 ^ 1 f(\\tau ) \\sigma_{\\gamma\\gamma",

    "however , if one wishes to observe the @xmath64 in the final state , experimental constrains require that a minimum cut on the transverse momentum of the final state electron @xmath67 be used . in this case the result is given by taking @xmath68 .    in order to study the anomalous higgs boson production via two - photon process at nlc",
    "we do not necessarily need to observe the final @xmath1 pair because it is not a product of the higgs boson decay .",
    "besides , for a nlc with @xmath69 gev and requiring @xmath70 gev one finds that the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ ph - apr ] ) is only 3.7(3.3)% of the total cross section for @xmath66 mev .",
    "therefore , more than 96 % of the anomalous higgs boson production via photon fusion happens when the final @xmath1 pair is undetected .",
    "the anomalous contributions for the @xmath71 interaction are significant only when the higgs boson is produced on  mass  shell , as we will see in section [ results ] .",
    "for this reason , we will use the production of @xmath72 and @xmath73 pairs to study a light higgs boson mass range of @xmath74 gev at a nlc with energy @xmath75 gev and integrated luminosity @xmath76 fb@xmath77 .",
    "the production of @xmath33 and @xmath34 pairs will be used to study a heavier higgs boson mass range of @xmath78 gev at a nlc with energy @xmath79 tev and integrated luminosity @xmath80 fb@xmath77 .",

    "in order to compute the contributions for the signal of anomalous higgs boson production via photon fusion with subsequent decay into pairs of bottom quarks , photons , and massive gauge bosons @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as well as for the background for these final state pairs of particles via direct , photon , and vector boson fusion production , we have have incorporated all anomalous couplings in helas ",
    "type @xcite fortran subroutines .",
    "these new subroutines were used to adapt a madgraph @xcite output to include all the anomalous contributions .",
    "we have checked that our code passed the non  trivial test of electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "we employed vegas @xcite to perform the monte carlo phase space integration to obtain the differential and total cross sections for the signal and the background ( sets i and ii ) .    to estimate the impact of the anomalous coefficients @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 in the higgs boson production via photon fusion ,",
    "we have evaluated the total cross section for signal and background for all processes described in section ( [ introduction ] ) .",
    "the signal was obtained considering that all anomalous operators coefficients have the same value @xmath87 tev@xmath28 , which is in agreement with the limits of eq.([limits ] ) . in order to avoid infrared divergences in the two photons final state",
    ", we have required these photons to have a transverse momentum of @xmath88 gev .",
    "an analysis of the significance of the signal ( significance = signal/@xmath89 ) shows that the @xmath32 production is a better option compared to the @xmath14 production in order to impose limits on the anomalous coefficients for a light higgs mass ( @xmath90 ) as one can see in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] . for higher masses ( @xmath91 ) ,",
    "tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] show that the @xmath92 production is a better option compared to the @xmath34 production .    in order to improve the sensitivity of nlc to the anomalous higgs boson production ,",
    "we have investigated different distributions of the final state particles for both signal ( @xmath93 tev@xmath28 ) and background .",
    "one of most promising variables is the transverse momentum of the final particles whose distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) for the @xmath72 final state and in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( a ) for the @xmath33 final state . in both cases , we observe that the contribution of the anomalous higgs production reaches its maximum contribution in @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mass of the higgs boson and @xmath96 is the sum of the masses of the final particles that should be a product of the higgs boson decay .",
    "similar behaviour is observed for the @xmath73 and @xmath34 final states .",
    "therefore , we require the transverse momentum of these final state particles to be in the range @xmath97 in this way , the significance of the signal is enhanced by a factor of at least 1.75 , compared to the previous analyses without any cut , as we can see in tables [ table1]-[table4 ] .",
    "the 95% cl allowed values for the coefficients @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath98 using the cut ( [ cut_pt ] ) are shown in figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] ( dashed lines ) for all the final pair productions .",
    "another promising variable is the invariant mass of the particles produced in the higgs decay , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) for the @xmath72 final state and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( b ) for the @xmath33 final state . since the contribution of the anomalous couplings is dominated by on  mass  shell higgs production with the subsequent @xmath99 decays , as can be clearly seen in the figures [ fig:1 ] ( b ) and [ fig:2 ] ( b ) , a more drastic cut would be to require @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the invariant mass of the final @xmath32 , @xmath14 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 pairs .",
    "the best constraints are obtained at nlc when this cut is applied , as we can be seen through the enhancement of the significance in tables [ table1]-[table4 ] .",
    "the 95%cl results obtained using the cut ( [ cut_minv ] ) are also shown in figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] .",
    "these results are more restrictive than the constraints obtained at lepi and at low energy [ eq .",
    "( [ limits ] ) ] and for @xmath102 and @xmath103 production at lepii and nlc @xcite , especially for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the search for the effect of higher dimensional operators that give rise to anomalous higgs boson couplings may provide important information on physics beyond the sm and should be pursued in all possible reactions . in this paper , we have studied the @xmath32 , @xmath14 , @xmath33,and @xmath34 production in high energy @xmath1 colliders ( nlc ) via photon fusion , focusing on the operators that generate anomalous @xmath16 coupling .    we established the limits that can be imposed at nlc through the analysis of the impact of the anomalous coupling over the total cross section of processes involving two final bottons , photons , w s , and z s bosons . in order to improve the sensitivity of nlc to this anomalous higgs boson production ,",
    "the limits were evaluated for the cases where a convenient cut on the transverse momentum spectrum and on the invariant mass spectrum of the final state particles is used .",
    "typical values of a few tev@xmath28 are reached in our analyses .",
    "our results are more restrictive than the constraints obtained at low energy data , at lepi , and for @xmath102 and @xmath103 production at lepii and nlc @xcite .",
