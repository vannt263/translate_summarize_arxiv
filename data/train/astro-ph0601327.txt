    "both methods give us internal scatters consistent to within a few 0.001  mag .",
    "all galaxies in this sample lie within three sigma from the fit .",
    "the x  ray distribution appears to be very symmetric , and largely confined within 15 from the cluster center .",

    "the slope of the elliptical cmr ( @xmath56 ) is slightly steeper than the observed slope in rxj1252.9 - 292 ( @xmath57 ) , and in coma when the latter are shifted to the observed colors at @xmath58 , using non - evolving bc03 stellar population models , but still consistent within the uncertainties .",

    "however , the s0 sample shows a much shallower slope ( @xmath59 ) than the ellipticals , resulting in a much flatter slope for ellipticals and s0s together ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this can explain why a shallower slope was found in that work , in which elliptical and s0s were not separated . the spectroscopically - selected elliptical plus s0 slope ( @xmath61 ) is also flattened by the s0 population , while the spectroscopically - selected ellipticals have a slope ( @xmath62 ) similar to that of rxj1252.9 - 292 and coma . all the difference in slope are however within the uncertainties and are statistically insignificant .",
    "using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; bc03 ) stellar population models , as in blakeslee et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , we derive a constraint on the age of the stellar populations in the galaxies from galaxy colors and the scatter of the cmr ( van dokkum et al . 2001 ; blakeslee et al .",
    "two simple models have been considered and our conclusions will depend on the chosen models .",
    "the first model is a _ single burst _",
    "model , in which galaxies form in single bursts at random times @xmath63 , between the age of the cluster and the recombination epoch .",
    "the second is a model with _ constant star formation _ in a range of time between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , randomly chosen to be between the age of the cluster and the recombination epoch .",

    ", we show the simulated scatters as a function of burst age , with solar , half solar and twice solar metallicity model .",
    "we will assume solar metallicity in what follows .",
    "from the scatter ( @xmath66 ) in the colors of the galaxies classified as ellipticals , we obtain ages @xmath67  gyr ( @xmath68 ) , with a mean luminosity  weighted age @xmath69  gyr ( @xmath70  3.1 ) , assuming the random single burst model . from the constant star formation model ,",
    "we obtain ages @xmath71  gyr ( @xmath72 ) , with a mean luminosity  weighted age @xmath73  gyr ( @xmath70  3 ) .",

    "a scatter in @xmath75 of @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath77 . as pointed out in van dokkum ( 2000 ) and blakeslee et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , cmr scatters vary little with redshift .",
    "the blakeslee et al .",
    "( 2003a ) scatter for the elliptical cmr in rdcs  12522927 ( @xmath78 ) , correspond to a scatter of @xmath79 in the ( u - b)rest frame , indistinguishable within the uncertainties from our result .",
    "the scatter in the cmr for galaxies classified as s0 ( @xmath80 ) is comparable to the one in the e cmr , but the galaxy colors are bluer and are not compatible with a population that is as old as the ellipticals .",
    "all the s0s lie below the elliptical color  magnitude relation .",
    "in fact , between the elliptical and the s0 cmr fits there is a zero point difference of @xmath10  mag , with the s0s being bluer than the ellipticals .",
    "one of the three s0/a galaxies has a color that is 0.07  mag redder than the elliptical cmr , and another has a color that is @xmath11  0.15 bluer than the cmr relation for es .",
    "the inclusion of the s0/a galaxies does not significantly change the fitted cmr for the s0s .",
    "when we consider all galaxies within 2@xmath49 from the cluster center , the s0 and total early  type slopes are similar , while the color offset in the cmr is still present ( @xmath81  mag ) .",
    "the s0 population of this cluster has a very peculiar cmr with respect to the average cluster of galaxies .",
    "in fact , for several other studies the cmr of the s0 population has a similar zero point and on average a larger scatter with respect to the elliptical population ( van dokkum et al . 1998 ; blakeslee et al . 2003a",
    "; holden et al . 2004 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ) , quite different from our results .",
    "we will discuss this peculiar behavior in detail in the rest of the paper , including an examination of orientation effects on the classification    in fig .",
    "[ ircolors ] , the near - ir ( vega magnitudes ) and @xmath0 ( ab magnitudes ) colors are shown compared with single burst stellar population model predictions from bc03 .",
    "the s0 colors are consistent with young ( @xmath82  2  gyr ) solar metallicity , or older ( @xmath82  3.5  gyr ) , half solar metallicity populations . if the difference in e and s0 mean colors is mainly due to metallicity , then even if the two populations were formed at the same epoch , ellipticals must have been able to retain more metals than the s0s , i.e. , they were more massive at a given luminosity ( given the observed mass  metallicity relation for early - type galaxies , e.g. , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , bernardi et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "this would imply higher mass  to  light ratios for the ellipticals with respect to the s0s .",
    "however , the lack of strong evolution in the slope and scatter of the cmr from the present out to @xmath83 suggests that the cmr is mainly the result of a metallicity  mass ( i.e. metallicity  magnitude ) relation ( e.g. , kodama & arimoto 1997 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 vazdekis et al .",
    "2001 ; bernardi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "so , at a given magnitude we do not expect large metallicity variations .",
    "if the offset is due to a different star formation history , a model with solar metallicity and with an exponential decay of the star formation will reproduce the offset at a galaxy mean age of @xmath11  3.5  gyr .",
    "this age is consistent with the small scatter observed in the s0 cmr .",
    "we would then be observing galaxies that followed different star formation : single burst and passive evolution for the ellipticals and exponentially decaying star formation for the s0s . an exponential decay in the star formation",
    "is observed in field spiral samples ( rowan  robinson 2001 ) .",
    "if this is the case , our s0 population might be the evolved product of an old spiral population that was already in place in this cluster when the ellipticals formed and then gradually lost available gas for star formation .",
    "if the e vs s0 color difference is mainly due to a difference in age , for a solar metallicity and a single burst bc03 template with age 4  gyr , the color difference corresponds to an age difference of @xmath131  gyr . for clusters of galaxies at z  @xmath53  1 , the cluster members on the red sequence are only a part of all the progenitors of present  day early  type galaxies .",
    "some of today s galaxy progenitors would have been bluer than the red sequence at these redshifts ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) . in the s0 population of this cluster",

    "just 9% ( 1 out of 11 ) of the red sequence s0s are observed to have an axial ratio this large ( or 22% for the full s0 sample in this cluster field ) ( fig  [ ab2 ] ; top ) .",
    "the random probability that the s0 axial ratios would show such a low fraction with @xmath98 is less than 1% .",
    "this is a very simple model , but it points out a lack of round s0s , indicating either that there is some orientation bias in the classification , or that this class of objects is intrinsically prolate in shape .",
    "jorgensen & franx ( 1994 ) found a similar deficit of round s0s in the center of the coma cluster .",
    "they concluded that part of the face  on s0s were classified as elliptical galaxies .",

    "their analysis shows that ellipticities and bulge  to  total  light ",
    "ratio do not allow us to distinguish elliptical from s0 galaxies .",
    "the other two acs gto clusters at @xmath103 ( rxj1252.9 - 292 and rx  j0848 + 4452 ) do not show a similar lack of round s0s , as 90% of the red sequence ellipticals ( out of @xmath10470 ) and 47% of the s0s ( out of @xmath10435 ) have @xmath98 ( fig  [ ab2 ] ; bottom ) .",
    "this bias is also not observed in other clusters of our acs intermediate redshift cluster survey ( see fig  5 from postman et al .",
    "2005 ) , for which more than 40% of the s0 galaxies have axial ratios above 0.7 .",
    "the observed peculiarity of the rxj  0910 + 5422 s0 axial ratio distribution might call into question our result above that the s0s have a significant color offset with respect to the ellipticals . for instance , if there is a bias in our color measurement procedure which causes elongated objects to have colors that are too blue , then the color offset found above may be artificial . such a color bias might occur if the high inclination angles bias our @xmath43 measurements to higher values , and if the s0s become progressively bluer at larger radii .",
    "we first examine this possibility , then proceed to discuss resolutions to the peculiarity of the s0 axial ratio distribution , with the aim to establish if a misclassification of face  on s0s as ellipticals would bias the measurement of the offset between the elliptical and s0 cmr zero points .",
    "it is conceivable that our @xmath46 colors could be biased by aperture effects in the nearly edge  on s0s , for which the ( possibly ) bluer outer disks might contribute more to the galaxy colors than in the rounder ellipticals population .",
    "if this effect were severe enough , it might mimic the offset in color of the s0s and ellipticals found above .",
    "we test this possibility here .",
    "s0 and elliptical internal color profiles are shown in fig  [ gradso ] and fig  [ grade ] .",
    "the gradients have been calculated with aperture photometry on the same images used to calculate our @xmath46 colors .",
    "circles are @xmath46 colors at different radii , the cross the @xmath46 color at the effective radius , used for the cmr .",
    "the s0 colors profiles do not show strong gradients .",
    "in particular , the @xmath46 colors calculated at the effective radii are not systematically bluer than colors determined at smaller radii .",
    "most of s0 galaxies have flat profiles ; one has a blue inward gradient ( acs i d 1621 ; @xmath105  mag , @xmath106  mag ) . in two galaxies ( acs i d 1393 and 3177 ) the colors in the central 0.15  @xmath107 are redder than the color at the effective radius .",
    "when compared with elliptical gradients , on average s0 colors do not appear biased towards higher effective radii and bluer colors than the ellipticals .",
    "we note that three elliptical galaxies show blue inward gradients ( acs i d 1753 , 1519 , 3323 ) .",
    "orientation biases are known to occur in the classification of ellipticals and s0s in local galaxy samples .",
    "for instance , rix & white ( 1990 , 1992 ) showed , based on both isophotal and dynamical modeling , that a large fraction of ellipticals contain a disk component with at least @xmath1220% of the light , but which is hidden due to projection effects .",
    "jorgensen & franx ( 1994 ) found a strong deficit of round s0s in a sample of 171 galaxies in the central square degree of the nearby coma cluster , and concluded that inclination angle played a large part in the classification of es and s0s .",
    "michard ( 1994 ) proposed that , except for the bright boxy ellipticals without rotational support , early - type galaxies comprise a single class of oblate rotators with orientation being the main criterion for classification as either e or s0 . on the other hand ,",
    "van den bergh ( 1994 ) explained the predominance of flattened s0s by invoking two distinct subpopulations : bright disky objects intermediate between ellipticals and spirals , and a fainter population of prolate objects .",
    "we now address the question of whether the galaxies classified as s0 in rxj  0910 + 5422 are preferentially flattened in shape because of an orientation bias in the classifications or intrinsically prolate shapes .",
    "if it is an orientation bias , then this could mean either that ( 1 ) face - on s0s have been misclassified as ellipticals because their disks are not apparent , or ( 2 ) that edge - on spirals tend to be called s0s because the spiral structure is obscured .",
    "either would result in a predominance of flattened s0s .",
    "however , in the former case , the misclassification of face - on s0s as ellipticals would tend to blur any color separation between the two classes , while in the latter case , a color offset might be introduced between the two classes because of contamination by bluer spirals . because we do observe a color offset between galaxies classified as e and s0 , with the s0s being bluer , it is possible to look for the `` missing '' population of face - on blue galaxies by examining ellipticity versus color .",
    "if a population of round blue objects is found , we can then determine the nature of the classification bias , and whether it biases our color offset measurement .",
    "histograms of the axial ratio distributions for ellipticals and s0s are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "we find that 60% of the early - type red sequence galaxies have @xmath98 , but 95% of these low - ellipticity galaxies are classified as es .",
    "however , if we split galaxies instead by color , using @xmath108  mag as the separation point , then we find that 54% of all galaxies bluer than this separation have @xmath98 , while 43% of the red sequence galaxies bluer than this [ @xmath109  mag ] have @xmath98 ( fig .",
    "[ ab3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the deficit of round s0 galaxies ( which are also significantly bluer than the mean of the e class ) is not found when the early - type galaxies are split based purely on color .",
    "this suggests that some of the bluer round galaxies are the face - on counterparts of those classified as s0 .",
    "fig  [ blue ] shows axial ratios vs @xmath110 color residuals with respect to the total early - type galaxy cmr relation , for all galaxies in the rxj  0910 + 5422 red sequence .",
    "galaxy types are coded with different symbols ; using the color residuals in this way takes out the effect of the magnitude dependence of the colors .",
    "there are five round blue ellipticals , i.e. , with @xmath98 and on the blue side of the early - type cmr .",
    "if these are the face - on counterparts of the blue s0s , then the s0 axial ratio distribution becomes much more in line with expectations for a randomly oriented disk population ( 35% are rounder than @xmath111 ) .",
    "further , we note that four other ellipticals were classified e / s0 in postman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; if these are also taken as face - on s0s , then the axial ratio distribution comes in very close agreement with expectations .",
    "we conclude that the face - on s0s in rxj  0910 + 5422 are classified as ellipticals , just as in local early - type galaxy samples . from our axial ratio simulations and statistics from our z@xmath111 acs gt0 sample",
    ", the number of blue s0 galaxies might be between 25 and 40% higher than estimated in section  5.3.1 .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of a few blue s0s in the elliptical red  sequence will have the effect of increasing very slightly the observed cmr scatter for the ellipticals .",
    "the uncertainty in the postman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) s0 fraction in rxj  0910 + 5422 is significantly larger than 40% and hence a systematic change by this amount for one cluster does not alter any of the results or conclusions in that paper .    throughout the paper",
    ", we continue to use elliptical and s0 classifications from postman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but keeping in mind the presence of this possible projection effect .",
    "stanford et al . ( 2002 ) have analyzed the x  ray and near - ir properties of this cluster .",
    "this system appears to be fairly relaxed based on its regular x ",
    "ray profile ; however , they find indications that the cluster is in an early phase of formation .",
    "in fact , the chandra acis data show evidence for temperature structure , possibly due to an infalling group or mass streaming along a filament .",
    "the soft component of the x  ray emission ( 0.52  kev ) dominates the x  ray center of the cluster , while to the south there is a harder component ( 26  kev ) ( see fig . 6 from stanford et al .",
    "the cluster does not have a central bcg or cd galaxy , and the x  ray emission center does not correspond to an optical grouping of galaxies ; rather a number of luminous confirmed cluster members are linearly distributed , at least as projected on the sky ( as shown in fig  [ cluster ] ) .",
    "we do not observe any strong trend of the galaxy color @xmath46 with distance from the cluster x  ray center ( fig .  [ colors ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , though not statistically significant , the bluer galaxies are concentrated toward the cluster center , instead of the outskirts , as in the other acs intermediate redshift cluster sample ( demarco et al . 2005",
    "; goto et al . 2005 ; homeier et al . 2005 ; postman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this tendency might support the hypothesis that we are observing sub - groups of galaxies in an edge  on sheet , e.g a group of bluer disk galaxies on a redder , older population of ellipticals .",
    "there are 10 confirmed elliptical and 5 confirmed s0 members in the center of the cluster ( r  @xmath82  500  kpc ) .",
    "the average s0 redshift is 1.102  @xmath112  0.002 and the average elliptical redshift is 1.105  @xmath112  0.007 ( the given uncertainties are standard deviations around the mean ) .",
    "this indicates small relative velocities ( the two redshifts are indistinguishable given the errors ) between the classes and is true regardless of the possible classification bias discussed above .",
    "unfortunately , our spectroscopic sample does not permit us to track the cluster central structure in detail .",
    "the average relative velocity between the confirmed e and s0s of @xmath11  500  km / s ( that also corresponds to the cluster velocity dispersion ; see below ) is fairly small . if merging of two distinct groups of galaxies is happening along the line of sight , we expect much higher velocity dispersions and/or relative velocities between the infalling s0s and the ellipticals .",
    "stanford et al . ( 2002 ) also suggest that active galaxy - galaxy merging should be observed , based on the x  ray temperature structure . to investigate any on  going dynamical activity , we calculated the cluster velocity dispersion , and the merger rate . from the 25 spectroscopically confirmed members ( all galaxy types included ) the line  of  sight rest ",
    "frame velocity dispersion is @xmath113  km / s , using the software rostat from beers , flynn , & gebhardt ( 1990 ) .",

    "wu et al . ( 1999 ; see also rosati et al .",
    "2002 ) gives the relationship between @xmath116 and @xmath86 for relaxed clusters , which predicts that the velocity dispersion corresponding to the measured x - ray temperature should be @xmath11  1000  km / s , considerably higher than we have found .",
    "again , in the case of merging groups ( along the line of sight ) we would also have expected a higher velocity dispersion .",
    "the quality of the acs data allows us to discern merging activity among the cluster galaxies . if we assume that galaxy pairs with projected separations less than @xmath117  kpc are physically associated , we observe 13 associated early  type galaxies , nine galaxies of which lie on a filamentary structure about @xmath11  100  kpc from the cluster center ( fig .",
    "[ cluster ] ) .",
    "as noted above , rxj  0910 + 5422 lacks any cd galaxy near the center of the x  ray emission ( see also fig .  [ cluster ] ) , but rather has a filamentary group of galaxies around the x  ray center .",
    "the nine early - type interacting galaxies within this filamentary structure ( at radius of @xmath118  kpc from the x  ray center ) include 3 unique pairs ( yellow arrows in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] ) , plus a galaxy triplet ( the three components marked with red arrows in fig .  [ cluster ] ) .",
    "each of the 3 pairs consists of a bright elliptical with a smaller companion ( all closer than @xmath119  kpc ) , while the triplet is a large e with two smaller s0s ( also closer than @xmath119  kpc ; one of these two s0s is acs i d 1621 , the s0 with an inward blue gradient ) .",
    "one of the pairs ( the middle pair in the figure ) and the two nearest galaxies in the triplet , have essentially zero relative velocity and thus are likely merger candidates .",
    "also two of the ellipticals with blue inward gradients lie on the central filaments , and they are both small satellites of a larger galaxy .",
    "the other two pairs , which do not lie on the filamentary structure , are at  @xmath120  kpc ( two e with similar size , both with weak o  ii emission ( stanford et al . 2002 ) and  @xmath121  kpc ( one s0/a and one e of similar size ) from the x  ray center , and have relative velocities of  10,000  km / s and  2000  km / s , respectively .",
    "the presence of the low - velocity pairs is consistent with the low velocity dispersion , and provides evidence for the on  going hierarchical growth of the cluster ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "the pairing of the bright ellipticals with smaller s0s also argues against the view that we are observing a blue s0-dominated group infalling into a red cluster elliptical population , but rather complex stellar population evolution within a filamentary structure .",
    "the red  sequence s0/a confirmed members also lie within this filamentary structure .",
    "the observations of a significant number of red galaxy pairs in a cluster at z  @xmath13  1 is interesting in the context of the recent findings by van dokkum ( 2005 ) of red galaxy interactions in @xmath11  70% of 86 early  type galaxies in a selected sample of nearby red galaxies from the musyc ( multiwavelength survey by yale  chile ; gawiser et al .",

    "<S> the color - magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs  j0910 + 5422 cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106 . </S>",

    "<S> postman et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 ) morphological classifications were used to identify the early - type galaxies .    the observed early  type color  magnitude relation ( cmr ) in @xmath0 versus @xmath1 shows an intrinsic scatter in color of @xmath2  mag , within @xmath3 from the cluster x  ray emission center . </S>",
    "<S> both the ellipticals and the s0s show small scatter about the cmr of @xmath4  mag and @xmath5  mag , respectively . from the scatter about the cmr , a mean luminosity  weighted age @xmath6  gyr ( @xmath7  3 ) </S>",
    "<S> is derived for the elliptical galaxies , assuming a simple stellar population modeling ( single burst solar metallicity ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a previous study of the cluster rdcs1252.9 - 292 at @xmath8 ( blakeslee et al . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the s0 galaxies in rdcs  j0910 + 5422 are systematically bluer in @xmath9 by @xmath10  mag , with respect to the ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> the blue s0s are predominantly elongated in shape ; the distribution of their ellipticities is inconsistent with a population of axisymmetric disk galaxies viewed at random orientations , suggesting either that they are intrinsically prolate or there is some orientation bias in the s0 classification . </S>",
    "<S> the ellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face - on s0s in this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if anything , the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may be even more significant .    </S>",
    "<S> the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of @xmath11  1  gyr , for a single - burst solar metallicity model . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it could be the result of a different star formation history ; a solar metallicity model with an exponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5 gyr , i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> the color offset could also be reproduced by a factor of @xmath122 difference in metallicity , but the two populations would each need to have very small scatter in metallicity to reproduce the small scatter in color .    </S>",
    "<S> the early  type population in this cluster appears to be still forming . the blue early - type disk galaxies in rdcs  j0910 </S>",
    "<S> + 5422 likely represent the direct progenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence as ellipticals in other clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairs constitute @xmath1340% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is consistent with the conclusions of van dokkum and tran et al . that most of the early  type galaxies grew from passive red mergers . </S>"
