    "accreting neutron stars and black hole candidates exhibit a rich variety of temporal variabilities .",
    "in addition to x - ray pulsations , flares , bursts , and eclipses , quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) are frequently observed .",
    "these are almost periodic variations in the radiation from a source , concentrated in relatively narrow frequency intervals , so that frequencies for the qpo can be meaningfully defined .",
    "several types of qpo have been identified in black hole candidate systems and in systems believed to contain accreting neutron stars .",
    "each has its own distinctive phenomenology , and presumably each has a different underlying mechanism .",
    "observations have shown that changes in the x - ray spectrum of a source are accompanied by corresponding changes in the frequencies , strengths , and widths of its qpo ( for reviews , see lewin , van paradijs , & van der klis  1988 ; and van der klis 1989 , 1993 , and  1995 ) .",
    "it is thus likely that a direct connection exists between the qpo and the production of radiation in the central engines of these sources .",
    "the development of models for qpo has taken a place on the agenda of high - energy astrophysics comparable in importance to the modeling of spectra : both are needed to obtain a clearer picture of how accreting systems work .    in searching for guides to the interpretation of quasiperiodic oscillations , it is helpful to examine the simplest possible models and ask what temporal variability they might engender .",
    "a classic paradigm for the study of accreting systems is spherical accretion .",
    "although spherical accretion is obviously a gross idealization of naturally occurring astrophysical flows , it remains a useful preliminary to the study of more realistic , and correspondingly more complex systems .",
    "studies of spherical accretion also may be directly applicable to components of an accretion flow with little angular momentum ; e.g. , if the accretion flow consists of a disk flow embedded in a coronal inflow , the coronal component might be treated as spherical to a first approximation ( lamb 1989 ; fortner , lamb , &  miller  1989 , hereafter flm89 ) .    the temporal variability of the brightest accretion - powered sources may be a consequence of radiation hydrodynamics . steady spherical accretion becomes impossible when the luminosity of the accreting system exceeds the eddington limit @xmath0 . at the eddington limit , the force on gas due to radiation escaping from the system exactly counterbalances the gravitational attraction of the central star . at higher luminosities , accretion can proceed only aspherically ( see , e.g. , the thick accretion disk models of abramowicz , calvani , & nobili  1980 ) or sporadically .",
    "many studies exist of steady , spherical radiation - hydrodynamic flow . here",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of accretion by a neutron star ( references to the literature on steady spherical black hole accretion are collected in zampieri , miller , & turolla  1996 , which contains a recent treatment of time - dependent spherical flow onto a black hole ) .",
    "early numerical work by shakura  ( 1974 ) , by maraschi , reina , and treves ( 1974 ,  1978 ) , and by vitello  ( 1978 ) explored the interaction of a steady spherical flow with the radiation it produces , treating the gravitational field of the accreting star newtonianly .",
    "analytic approximations for steady newtonian flow solutions were obtained by miller  ( 1990 ) .",
    "the newtonian approximation was dropped by park and miller  ( 1991 ) , who obtained numerical solutions for steady accretion onto a neutron star with a fully general relativistic treatment .",
    "they found that the `` settling regime '' of the accretion flow , where the infalling gas decelerates and settles onto the stellar surface , is severely modified by the effects of general relativity : general relativistic flows tend to decelerate to much lower speeds than newtonian flows , and hence have far greater densities and optical depths . although one might anticipate that general relativistic modifications of flow solutions would be small ( of the order of the dimensionless gravitational potential at the neutron star surface , @xmath1\\approx 0.2 $ ] ) , the near stalemate between radiation forces and gravitation in the settling regime makes general relativity disproportionately important .",
    "several authors have studied time - dependent spherical flow onto a neutron star .",
    "klein , stockman , & chevalier  ( 1980 ) performed numerical simulations of supercritical accretion , in which mass was supplied to the neutron star at rates @xmath2 much greater than the eddington rate @xmath3 necessary to produce a luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "they found that their flows became choked with radiation , so that accretion in the inner parts of the flow proceeded only fast enough to bring the system luminosity up to the eddington limit .",
    "the same conclusions were reached by burger & katz  ( 1983 ) , who conducted a similar study .",
    "both groups treated the neutron star s gravitational field in the newtonian approximation , and followed the development of their flows for relatively short times , typically tens of milliseconds .",
    "fortner , lamb , & miller  ( 1989 ) examined spherical accretion at rates @xmath2 slightly smaller than the critical rate @xmath3 , and allowed their flows to evolve for much longer times .",
    "they found that near - critical flows can develop global oscillations , in which episodes of stronger inflow alternate with periods during which the radiation escapes .",
    "all of the flows in these investigations were restricted to strict spherical symmetry .",
    "departures from spherical symmetry allow radiation to escape more readily through some regions of the flow , while material accretes preferentially elsewhere .",
    "aspherical flows were studied by miller and park ( 1995 ; hereafter mp95 ) .",
    "they treated the problem perturbatively by linearizing the radiation hydrodynamic equations about steady , spherical flow solutions ; thus , fully asymmetrical flows could be examined , as long as departures from the underlying spherical flow solutions were not too great .",
    "the resulting quasispherical flow solutions included both the spherical oscillatory modes found in flm89 and new aspherical modes . as in flm89 , their treatment of gravity was newtonian .    in this paper",
    "we abandon the newtonian approximation and adopt a fully general relativistic treatment of radiation hydrodynamics , motivated by the known importance of general relativistic effects for the structure of steady flows . as in mp95",
    ", we adopt a perturbative approach that allows us to find both spherical and aspherical flow solutions , which are valid as long as the amplitudes of the flow perturbations are not too large .",
    "our method , radiation hydrodynamic equations , and boundary conditions are described in section  2 . because our description of the hydrodynamics is linear , arbitrary disturbances in the flow can be decomposed into independent modes .",
    "section  3 contains our numerical results for the low - order modes .",
    "our conclusions appear in section  4 .",
    "the approach to radiation hydrodynamics adopted here is essentially perturbative .",
    "it begins with a background flow : a steady , spherically symmetric solution to the full , nonlinear general relativistic equations for radiation hydrodynamic accretion by a neutron star .",
    "the radiation hydrodynamic equations then are linearized about the background flow solution .",
    "the resulting partial differential equations describe the evolution of small departures from the background flow .    in the linear regime",
    ", an arbitrary initial perturbation can be regarded as a linear superposition of radiation hydrodynamic eigenmodes .",
    "this enormously simplifies the investigation of variability and aspherical flow patterns in radiation hydrodynamic flows . to solve for the structure of an eigenmode and its temporal development ,",
    "the full system of linearized partial differential equations is unnecessary ; one need only solve an eigenvalue problem based on a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the flows employed in this study are extremely simple .",
    "only the gravitation of the accreting neutron star and radiation forces govern the flow dynamics .",
    "since gravitation by the flow itself is insignificant , and the neutron star is assumed to have negligible rotation , the spacetime outside the stellar radius @xmath4 is described by the schwarzschild metric @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radial coordinate , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the usual spherical angular coordinates , and the gravitational radius @xmath9 of the neutron star is @xmath10 in terms of the neutron star mass @xmath11 .",
    "( we adopt units in which @xmath12 , but for the sake of clarity occasionally retain factors of @xmath13 in mathematical expressions . )    within this spacetime , momentum and energy are conserved locally , so that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the stress - energy tensor ( @xmath16 is the flux of the @xmath17-momentum component in the @xmath18-direction ; see weinberg 1972 ) and the semicolon denotes covariant differentiation .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is the sum of a part @xmath19 due to the gas and a part @xmath20 due to photons .",
    "thus , @xmath21 the four - vector @xmath22 describes the exchange of momentum and energy between the gas and the radiation field . at the temperatures ( @xmath23@xmath24 ) and densities ( @xmath25 ) typical of the flows considered in this paper , the radiation energy density grossly exceeds the thermal energy density of gas particles in the flow .",
    "moreover , to a good approximation , the opacity @xmath26 of the gas is constant and independent of photon energy , since it is dominated by thomson scattering , and the number of free electrons per baryon does not vary ( electron - positron pair production is unimportant , and it is assumed that the gas is fully ionized ) .",
    "the former condition allows the thermal energy of the gas to be neglected , so that the stress - energy tensor for the gas is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the four - velocity of the gas and @xmath29 is the mass density of the gas in the comoving frame .",
    "since the thermal energy of the gas is negligible , compton heating and cooling terms do not appear in @xmath22 , which describes only the effects on the gas of the bulk radiation force : if @xmath30 is the four - acceleration of the gas , then @xmath31 . in the comoving frame",
    "the gas is instantaneously at rest , and as compton scattering transfers momentum from the radiation field to the gas , the gas experiences a three - acceleration @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the radiation energy flux ( the subscript `` co '' refers to quantities measured by a comoving observer ) .",
    "this determines @xmath34 , which is @xmath35 { \\kappa\\over c}\\rho\\,.\\ ] ] ( the quantity in square brackets is the four - vector generalization of @xmath36 . )    the flux of baryons in the gas is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the baryon mass and @xmath39 .",
    "when eqn .",
    "[ [ momentumenergy ] ] is supplemented by the continuity equation @xmath40 one obtains a complete set of equations for the evolution of the gas flow .",
    "these equations derive from conservation laws ( eqns .  [ [ momentumenergy ] ] and  [ [ continuity ] ] ) , a constitutive relation for the stress - energy tensor @xmath19 in terms of the gas variables @xmath29 and @xmath28 ( eqn .  [ [ gasstressenergy ] ] ; essentially an `` equation of state '' ) , and a prescription for the transfer of momentum and energy between the gas and radiation field ( eqn .",
    "[ [ aprescription ] ] ) .    to complete the description of the radiation field , a constitutive relation for @xmath20 is required .",
    "close to the stellar surface , where the photon scattering mean - free paths @xmath41 typically are short compared to the length scales @xmath42 characterizing gradients in the radiation energy density or flow velocity , the radiation field seen by an observer moving with the gas is almost isotropic . in these optically thick regions",
    "the flow speed @xmath43 measured by a stationary observer satisfies @xmath44 , and to a good approximation the radiation stress - energy tensor is @xmath45\\vec e_r\\otimes\\vec e_r+ r^{-2}\\vec e_\\theta\\otimes\\vec e_\\theta + [ r\\sin\\theta]^{-2}\\vec e_\\phi\\otimes\\vec e_\\phi\\right ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the radiation energy density , and @xmath47 , etc . , are the components of the radiation energy flux , all measured by a stationary observer ( see park  1993 for a discussion of the spherical case ) . the basis vectors @xmath48 are not normalized , since they are coordinate - based : @xmath49 ( see , e.g. , shapiro and teukolsky  1983 ) .",
    "terms omitted from expression  ( [ tphdiffusion ] ) are @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; such terms include the small corrections to the radiation force on the gas flow due to radiation viscosity .",
    "far from the stellar surface the flow is optically thin , radiation streams radially outward , and the radiation stress tensor is @xmath52 expression  ( [ tphdiffusion ] ) completes the dynamical description of the radiation field in the optically thick regime , as does expression  ( [ tphstreaming ] ) for the optically thin regime , since when they are substituted in the conservation equation  ( [ momentumenergy ] ) , both yield equations for the temporal evolution of all the components of @xmath20 .",
    "this simplicity is lost in the intermediate regime , where to find @xmath53 one must generally solve for the entire photon distribution function ( the specific intensity in all directions at every location in the flow ) . a simpler procedure , which prevents the radiation hydrodynamic calculation from becoming intractable , is to force closure of the equations for the radiation field by adopting an expression for @xmath20 that interpolates between the optically thick and optically thin limits .",

    "the sensitivity of steady flow calculations to the form of the @xmath55 prescription is discussed in park  & miller  1991 . to test the dependence of our dynamical results on the @xmath55 prescription",
    ", we occasionally repeated our calculations with the choice @xmath59)/(1 + 3\\tau[1+\\tau])$ ] .",
    "we found no significant differences in the mode eigenvalues @xmath60 ( for a description of the modes and a definition of @xmath60 , see eqn .",
    "[ [ scalartildedef ] ] and the following discussion ) .",
    "the accreting neutron star is centered within a spherical boundary surface of radius @xmath61 .",
    "the outer boundary conditions describe the entry of gas into the flow volume , and the escape of radiation .",
    "gas flows inward though the boundary surface uniformly and with no angular momentum , so that the gas four - velocity @xmath62 ( the @xmath7- and @xmath8- components have been normalized for later convenience ) and comoving density @xmath29 there are given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are constants ( note that @xmath68 , since gas flows inward through the boundary ) .",
    "an observer very far from the neutron star ( where gravitational redshifts are unimportant ) sees baryons enter the flow at a rate @xmath69 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath70 the radius @xmath61 is large enough that the probability of photon scattering from material near the outer boundary is very small ( @xmath71 ) , and so the radiation may be assumed to stream radially outward there . consequently , the radiation flux at the outer boundary is related to the energy density by @xmath72 the inner flow boundary is also spherical and just encloses the stellar surface .",
    "material flows through the inner boundary onto the stellar surface , where its kinetic energy is converted to radiation .",
    "this radiation enters the flow though the inner boundary : @xmath73^{1/2}u^t-1\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] the azimuthal fluxes @xmath74 and @xmath75 are unconstrained .",
    "the constant term @xmath76 represents a steady contribution to the flux from the stellar surface that is independent of the instantaneous state of the impinging accretion flow ; e.g. , it can be used to account for radiation produced by steady nuclear burning beneath the neutron star surface .",
    "if the spherical flows studied here are regarded as approximations to a quasi - spherical coronal flow component that overlies a thin disk flow ( see flm89 , mp95 ) , @xmath76 may be used to mimic the injection of radiation into the coronal flow from the innermost portions of the embedded disk .",
    "physically , @xmath76 is an energy flux measured by an observer at the stellar surface .",
    "because a stationary observer at infinity finds redshifts in the photon energy and arrival rate , the @xmath76 term contributes an amount @xmath77 to the luminosity of the accreting system .",
    "these boundary conditions , which describe how material and radiation enter and leave the flow volume , completely define a steady spherical background flow , and also fully determine the temporal development of any initial deviations from the steady flow .",
    "it is convenient to label background flows with two dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first describes how close the luminosity of the accretion flow is to the eddington limiting luminosity @xmath0 , the critical point beyond which steady spherical flow solutions cease to exist : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the eddington accretion rate . as @xmath80 approaches zero , the system luminosity approaches the eddington limit .",
    "the second parameter characterizes the accretion rate in terms of the eddington accretion rate : @xmath81 the near - critical background flows have a simple structure ( see park & miller  1991 , and references therein ) .",
    "far from the neutron star , material accelerates as it falls inward .",
    "radiation forces on the infalling gas prevent it from achieving full free - fall speeds .",
    "instead , radiation effectively dilutes the gravitational field of the star and the speed approaches the modified free - fall value @xmath82 . at a transition radius @xmath83 ,",
    "the flow starts to become optically thick to scattering , and the radiation energy density mounts more rapidly with decreasing radius than @xmath84 .",
    "the radiation drag on the inflowing gas increases with the radiation energy density , and the flow speed falls below the modified free - fall value . at smaller radii , where the flow is quite optically thick , the radiation drag is a dominant influence on the flow , and the flow decelerates as it moves inward , settling onto the stellar surface .",
    "thus , the flow structure has three regimes : an optically thin regime far from the neutron star where the flow accelerates inward , a transitional regime , and an optically thick settling regime close to the neutron star , where the radiation energy density is high and radiation drag decelerates the inflow .",
    "figure  1 shows the velocity profile @xmath85 for a typical near - critical accretion flow .    as an aside , we note that the background flow in figure  1 does not merge smoothly into the stellar surface . within the surface ,",
    "gas pressure , particularly electron degeneracy pressure , dominates radiation pressure , while the opposite is true in the flow above the stellar surface .",
    "the transition between the two limits occurs abruptly in a layer of thickness @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the average random kinetic energy per gas particle , and @xmath88 is the average mass of a gas particle .",
    "( if the flow speed exceeds the random velocities of gas particles , the gas makes the transition to the stellar surface through a shock . ) to reproduce the transition layer , it would be necessary to include gas pressure and an energy equation for the gas in the mathematical description of the flow , and our numerical code would be forced to follow the flow either through a shock or through an enormous dynamical range of densities in a geometrically very thin layer . since the detailed structure of the transition layer does not significantly affect the radiation field above the surface ,",
    "it is unimportant to the large - scale dynamics of the flow , and we avoid considerable numerical difficulties by implicity placing the transition just below our inner boundary at @xmath4 .",
    "because the background flows are time - independent and spherically symmetric , an arbitrary perturbation can be written as a sum of eigenmodes , each of which depends exponentially on the time coordinate @xmath89 , and as a spherical harmonic on the angular coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "hence , scalar quantities such as the comoving density @xmath29 are written in the form @xmath90 where the subscript  `` 0 '' refers to the background flow value , and the subscript  `` 1 '' denotes the perturbation . for an eigenmode , @xmath91 the eigenfrequency @xmath60 is complex , and the modes can grow or decay with time .",
    "modes with @xmath92 are stable , and modes with @xmath93 are unstable .",
    "the radial and time components of the four - velocity perturbation @xmath94 may also be written in the form  ( [ scalartildedef ] ) , as may the radiation energy density perturbation @xmath95 and radial flux perturbation @xmath96 .",
    "quantities such as @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 are also related to the spherical harmonics and take the forms @xmath101 and @xmath102 the spherical symmetry of the background flow implies that the eigenfrequencies and radial eigenfunctions ( e.g. , @xmath103 $ ] ) depend only on the harmonic number @xmath104 , not on the azimuthal number @xmath88 . in the discussion",
    "below , we therefore label modes only by @xmath104 and suppress @xmath88 . by decomposing perturbations into eigenmodes , the problem of finding the time - evolution of weakly unsteady and possibly aspherical flows",
    "is reduced to that of finding the modes , which in turn involves only solving a system of ordinary differential equations ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "the numerical method we used to find the modes in this paper is slightly different from the one described in mp95 .",
    "first , we calculate a background flow with a given luminosity and mass accretion rate ( parameterized by @xmath80 and @xmath105 ; as an outer boundary condition , all the background flows in this paper have velocities @xmath106 $ ] ) .",
    "next , for a given value of @xmath104 , we obtain approximate values of the eigenfrequencies for all the low - frequency modes by making a map of the complex plane .",
    "each point on the map corresponds to a _ trial _ eigenvalue .",
    "using the trial eigenvalue and the outer boundary conditions , we integrate the linearized radiation hydrodynamic equations inward and obtain a figure of merit ( a real number @xmath107 ) that quantifies the failure of the trial eigenvalue to satisfy the inner boundary condition .",
    "trial values that are true eigenvalues produce @xmath108 , and other trials produce higher numbers .",
    "we plot contours of @xmath109 on the trial @xmath60-plane ( an example appears in figure  2 ; only the right half of the complex plane is plotted , since the equations of motion guarantee that each eigenfrequency @xmath60 on the right half of the complex plane has a twin on the left side , at @xmath110 ) , and find the eigenvalues by visual inspection . with these visual estimates of the eigenvalues as starting values",
    ", we are able to solve numerically for the modes and their eigenvalues by simple automated shooting , refining the eigenvalue approximation at each successive iteration .",
    "this scheme guarantees that no low - frequency eigenmodes are overlooked .",
    "low - frequency radiation hydrodynamic eigenmodes may be categorized as oscillatory or nonoscillatory , and as spherical or aspherical .",
    "oscillatory modes occur through a feedback mechanism in which enhanced radiation production hinders the progress of material from the outer boundary to the stellar surface , so that episodes of high radiation production alternate with intervals during which the inner flow is starved , and radiation production falls below the average .",
    "the periods of these oscillations are typically comparable to the inflow time @xmath111 , the time taken by a fluid particle in the unperturbed flow to pass from the outer boundary to the stellar surface , as measured by an observer at infinity : @xmath112 oscillatory modes are both spherical ( @xmath113 ) and aspherical ( @xmath114 ) .    as an example of an aspherical mode , figure  3 shows the first half of an @xmath115 , @xmath116 oscillation .",
    "the radial ( @xmath117 $ ] ) and tangential ( @xmath118 $ ] ) velocity perturbations at the beginning , middle , and end of the half cycle are plotted .",
    "only the radial dependences of the perturbed velocity components are shown ; the components depend on the colatitude @xmath7 through equations  ( [ scalartildedef ] ) and  ( [ thetatildedef ] ) .",

    "3 has been normalized so that the radiative flux perturbation at the outer boundary is @xmath121 .",
    "the flux is high at @xmath122 , the onset of the half cycle . at the same instant ,",
    "a negative perturbation in the radial velocity increases the mass accretion rate above the stellar poles , and pours energy into the radiation field .",
    "eddy currents in the gas advect the excess radiation out of the flow .",
    "the rising radiation pressure drives material sideways , away from the poles .",
    "gas moves from both poles across the stellar surface , until it reaches the equator and is forced upward . at about @xmath123 above the stellar surface ( a distance comparable to the density and pressure scale heights in the unperturbed flow ) , the radial velocity perturbations vanish , and gas which has risen from the stellar equator stalls and drifts sideways , to join the columns descending onto the poles .",
    "the perturbed flow pattern close to the stellar surface thus essentially consists of two doughnut - shaped convective cells , which draw gas down over the stellar poles and loft gas and radiation above the equator . immediately above each of these two cells sits an elongated counterrotating cell that extends outward into the optically thin portions of the flow .",
    "this second tier of cells carries radiation - laden material horizontally back from the equator to the poles , where it rises .",
    "thus , above each pole where a descending perturbation enhances the production of radiation , rising gas in the second tier of convective cells carries radiation out of the optically thick inner flow , and contributes to the positive perturbation in radiative flux at the flow s outer boundary .",
    "the excess radiation flux decelerates gas entering the flow through the outer boundary , reinforcing the flow perturbation and ensuring that as each convective cell is carried out of the flow through the inner boundary , a new cell forms in the gas entering the flow .",
    "because the feedback cycle is inefficient , each repetition is weaker than the one that preceded it , and the mode decays .",
    "the velocity perturbations at the middle and the end of the half cycle show how the pattern of alternating cells weakens as the background flow advects it inward .",
    "spherical nonoscillatory modes are related to the spherical oscillatory modes and typically are damped .",
    "an analytic calculation for the frequencies of spherical modes in optically thin flows gives @xmath124 where @xmath125 is an integer ( mp95 ) .",
    "the nonoscillatory modes correspond to @xmath126 .",
    "the flow in a spherical nonoscillatory mode moves inward more slowly than the unperturbed flow , and is overdense and overluminous .",
    "the luminosity perturbation inhibits the inward flow of gas , causing a `` traffic jam . '' as overdense material is accreted by the neutron star , it is replaced by somewhat less dense material from the outer boundary , and the flow congestion is gradually relieved . as in the case of the oscillatory modes , the timescale for the evolution of the mode is set by the flow time @xmath111 .",
    "the aspherical nonoscillatory modes are often unstable , and correspond to the onset of global convective motions in the optically thick inner flow .",
    "figure  4 shows the velocity perturbations of an unstable @xmath115 , @xmath116 mode at three successive moments in its development .",
    "( the normalization of the mode is the same as in fig .  3 . )",
    "the velocity perturbations are similar to those seen at the beginning of the oscillation in fig .  3 , but the pattern in a nonoscillatory mode rises upward through the descending background flow just fast enough to remain fixed in space . rather than being advected by the flow",
    ", it simply grows in strength .",
    "the growth rates of the aspherical nonoscillatory modes are determined in the inner parts of the accretion flow , and are consequently independent of the flow time @xmath111 ( which is dominated by the time a fluid particle spends traveling through the outer parts of the flow ) for sufficiently large outer boundary radii @xmath61 .",
    "tables 16 show how , as the outer boundary radius increases from @xmath127 to @xmath128 , the growth rates of the aspherical nonoscillatory modes approach finite asymptotic limits .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the behavior of the oscillatory and spherical nonoscillatory modes frequencies , which decrease to zero as @xmath129 .",
    "_ thus , independent of the boundary conditions imposed at large distances from the accreting star , spherical radiation hydrodynamic accretion is unstable to aspherical perturbations  even at luminosities significantly below the eddington limit , where steady , spherically symmetric flow solutions are readily found . _",
    "the growth of aspherical perturbations appears to be related to the entropy stratification of the optically thick flow . where less buoyant , entropy - poor material overlies more buoyant , entropy - rich material , the flow is unstable to convection .",
    "if radiative diffusion is not too severe , the condition for convective stability is the familiar schwarzschild criterion , @xmath130 .",
    "the background flows characteristically have a layer in which @xmath131 at moderate optical depths , near the transition radius @xmath132 . as aspherical perturbations are carried by the background flow into this layer , they grow .",
    "they then enter the underlying stably stratified fluid , and execute damped , buoyancy - supported oscillations  as seen by an observer moving with the fluid .",
    "an observer at rest sees a standing wave .",
    "the standing wave grows because it produces radiation flux perturbations that excite larger `` seed '' velocity perturbations in the optically thin outer flow .",
    "these subsequently grow in the destabilizing layer , and ultimately produce yet greater flux perturbations .",
    "the value of the stability parameter @xmath133 and of the proper radial velocity perturbation it produces are shown in figure  5 .",
    "( among all of the general relativistic flows we have examined , we have found no unstable oscillatory modes , although in mp95 we reported a few weakly unstable aspherical oscillatory newtonian modes in flows with luminosities within 2% of the eddington limit [ @xmath134 .",
    "we have traced the oscillatory instability to an error in the newtonian mode - generating program used for that paper , which significantly affected the eigenfrequencies of only the aspherical modes of the @xmath135 flows . )",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the modes follow two simple trends : ( i )  slower , denser flows ( flows with smaller values of @xmath80 or higher values of @xmath105 ) tend to oscillate more slowly than faster , more tenuous flows ; and ( ii )  the radiation hydrodynamic modes in slower , denser flows tend to be less damped ( or even more unstable ) .",
    "although they are true of all modes , both trends are occasionally violated by aspherical modes .",
    "for example , the frequency of the oscillatory @xmath136 mode in table  7 _ rises _ slightly as the system luminosity climbs from @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) to @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , although the the higher luminosity flow moves more slowly .    the anomalous behavior of the aspherical modes arises because aspherical waves propagating through optically thick gas do not have to move at the same speed as the gas in the flow . an ingoing aspherical wave thus can take considerably longer than the flow time @xmath111 to travel from the outer boundary to the stellar surface , and @xmath111 becomes a poorer estimate of the fundamental timescale for feedback - supported oscillations .",
    "general disturbances in the radiation - dominated gas may be decomposed into sound waves ( vorticity - free velocity perturbations , and adiabatic perturbations in the gas and radiation energy densities ) and internal waves ( perturbations in the vorticity and entropy of the flow ) .",
    "sound waves travel very rapidly through the optically thick flow , which is subsonic , and are strongly damped by radiative diffusion in the optically thin flow .",
    "sound - like modes consequently are expected to have high frequencies and to be strongly damped ; they play little role in the low - frequency spherical and aspherical modes , which are essentially internal waves . to see how internal waves propagate , consider a wave that varies in space and time as @xmath141 . for simplicity ,",
    "assume that the wavelength is small compared to typical flow length scales ( such as the density scale height @xmath142 ; @xmath143 ) , and that radiation diffusion can be neglected .",
    "the frequency @xmath60 and wavevector @xmath144 are related through the dispersion relation @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the velocity of the unperturbed flow , @xmath147-\\gamma)^{1/2}(g / h)^{1/2}$ ] is the brunt - visl frequency , and @xmath148 is the component of the wavevector @xmath144 perpendicular to @xmath149 , the gravitational acceleration .",
    "( the brunt - visl frequency describes buoyancy - driven oscillations in a fluid with a stable entropy stratification .",
    "when the stratification is unstable  more buoyant fluid underlying less buoyant fluid  the frequency is imaginary , and describes the growth of convective motions . for a general treatment of internal waves ,",
    "see lighthill [ 1978 ] ; internal waves in a diffusive , radiation - dominated fluid are discussed in miller & grossman [ 1997 ] .",
    "diffusion tends to reduce the brunt - visl frequency and damps the oscillations . )",
    "the important feature of the dispersion relation is that globally spherically symmetric disturbances correspond to @xmath150 , and move passively with the fluid .",
    "aspherical waves ( @xmath151 ) move in the fluid s rest frame , and if they move upstream can spend a much longer time in the optically thick accretion flow than can spherical waves , causing the eigenfrequency of the mode to depart significantly from the estimate  ( [ frequencyestimate ] ) .",
    "such anomalous aspherical waves also are particularly susceptible to general relativistic effects , which are strongest near the stellar surface .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of general relativistic and newtonian modes are compared in table  7 .",
    "the spherical modes are affected only weakly by general relativity .",
    "this reflects the fact that the key to their operation is the influence of escaping radiation on the inflowing gas near the outer boundary , where specifically general relativistic effects are of minimal importance : the mode eigenfrequencies of the general relativistic and newtonian flows do not differ significantly .",
    "in contrast , general relativity often exerts a considerable influence on the frequencies of the aspherical modes . as an extreme example",
    ", it sometimes happens that , as the parameter @xmath80 is changed , a complex eigenfrequency @xmath60 on the right half of the complex plane and its twin @xmath110 on the left half abruptly move to the imaginary axis and merge , and then bifurcate into two imaginary ( nonoscillatory ) eigenfrequencies .",
    "this exchange of oscillatory for nonoscillatory modes occurs in both general relativistic and in newtonian flows , but tends to happen at very different values of @xmath80 in the two cases .",
    "thus , a nonoscillatory general relativistic mode will sometimes have no newtonian counterpart .",
    "an example occurs in the @xmath136 , @xmath140 entry of table  7 , where a newtonian 5.2  hz oscillation and its complex conjugate have replaced the the pair of nonoscillatory modes present at smaller values of @xmath80 .",
    "the rapid drop of the stability parameter with radius in fig .",
    "5 raises the possibility that a class of aspherical oscillations exists that we have not yet found in our numerical surveys . along with the stability parameter ,",
    "the brunt - visl frequency decreases steeply with increasing radius , a condition that should trap high - frequency internal waves near the stellar surface and give rise to a set of aspherical modes ( a terrestrial example occurs when internal modes are trapped by oceanic thermoclines ; lighthill 1978 , p.  302 ) .",
    "we plan to return to this point in future work .",
    "the aspherical radiation hydrodynamic modes share the general tendency of the spherical modes to decrease in frequency when the system luminosity increases , but there are anomalous luminosity intervals in which mode frequencies rise with the luminosity .",
    "an additional peculiarity of the aspherical modes is that a pair of nonoscillatory modes can coalesce in frequency , and reemerge as a pair of oscillatory modes .",
    "when this happens , the oscillatory mode frequency changes very rapidly with slight changes in the luminosity .",
    "although similar behavior has been observed in the `` normal branch '' quasiperiodic oscillations ( nbo ) of some accreting neutron star systems , and we are partisan supporters of radiation hydrodynamic models for these models ( lamb 1989 , flm89 ) , we suspect that aspherical modes are not directly involved .",
    "it appears that as the mass accretion rate increases by @xmath152% , the nbo frequency remains almost constant at @xmath153hz , and then increases sharply to @xmath154hz ( van der klis 1996 , pp .",
    "279285 ) .",
    "purely spherical radiation hydrodynamic modes can account for the frequency scales and spectral appearance ( miller & lamb 1992 ) of the oscillations , but are challenged by the observed frequency variations . an aspherical mode could increase that rapidly in frequency , but would do so starting from @xmath155 .",
    "it is more likely that , if the radiation hydrodynamic model is correct , the nbo is a quasispherical mode in a mildly aspherical coronal flow .",
    "the asphericity of the background flow would couple spherical and aspherical modes , and ( especially given the instability described above ) the coupling could be expected to become more severe as the system approached the eddington luminosity . if a spherical mode with unperturbed frequency @xmath156 couples dominantly to an aspherical mode with frequency @xmath157 , then to lowest order in the perturbation , the frequency of the resulting quasispherical mode is @xmath158 , where @xmath159 describes the strength of the aspherical coupling .",
    "if the coupling strengthens sufficiently as the luminosity rises , the quasispherical mode can reproduce the observed frequency behavior .",
    "observationally , the steep rise in qpo frequency coincides with a sudden change in the relation between the mass accretion rate of the source and its x - ray spectrum .",
    "we argue below that the change in the spectral behavior may be due to the onset of an aspherical mode instability .",
    "our numerical results indicate that spherical , radiation - hydrodynamic accretion is unstable to aspherical perturbations even when the luminosity @xmath160 seen by an observer at infinity is substantially less than the eddington limit  flows with luminosities as small as @xmath137 are mildly unstable . within the limits of a linear stability analysis , it is impossible to say whether the nonlinear development of the instability culminates in gentle convective motions within an almost spherical inflow , or whether the flow eventually differentiates itself into accreting and outflowing zones , e.g. , accreting through the equatorial plane , and outflowing at the poles .",
    "the eigenmodes themselves suggest that the former possibility is the most likely : convective motions comparable to the unperturbed flow speed might be expected to `` mix away '' the destabilizing layer on which the mode s growth depends , but in the optically thin outer flow the perturbations in velocity still would be well below the mean inflow speeds , and the flux perturbations would be extremely minor .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of radiation - driven outflow can not be excluded .",
    "the question can only be resolved with a fully nonlinear study of two- or three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic flows .    whatever the endstates of the unstable radiation hydrodynamic modes might be , we note speculatively that they may already have been observed in the brightest low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "as an accreting system approaches the eddington luminosity from below , the growing radiation forces cause the flow to decelerate and become more optically thick to compton scattering .",
    "if the unstable aspherical radiation hydrodynamic modes reach sufficient amplitudes , this trend may reverse beyond a threshold luminosity : gas motions associated with the mode advect photons out of the flow more efficiently than would be possible through diffusion alone , and the average number of scatters suffered by escaping photons decreases .",
    "interestingly , detailed models of x - ray spectral production in the coronae of rapidly accreting low - mass x - ray binaries _ require _ that when the luminosities @xmath160 in these systems closely approach or exceed @xmath0 , the effective scattering optical depth of their coronae must decrease ( psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) . without an instability , at high accretion rates the coronal flows",
    "would simply become progressively glutted with plasma , and it would be hard to understand the observed spectral behavior .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grants nagw-2935 and nag5 - 3396 , and by kosef grant 971 - 0203 - 013 - 2 .",
    "gas enters the outer boundary steadily and uniformly , so that the velocity and density perturbations vanish there : @xmath161 and @xmath162 because radiation is streaming outward at the outer boundary , @xmath163 at the inner boundary , radial flux perturbations reflect perturbations in the kinetic energy deposited by the flow : @xmath164^{-1/2}-u^t_0\\right ) \\left(\\den u_0+\\ur\\rho_0\\right ) -u^t_1 u_0\\rho_0 \\,,\\ ] ] where the abbreviation @xmath165 has been introduced , and @xmath166 .",

    "<S> in this paper we examine time - dependent and three - dimensional perturbations of spherical accretion flow onto a neutron star close to its eddington limit . our treatment assumes a schwarzschild geometry for the spacetime outside the neutron star and is fully general relativistic . at all the accretion rates studied , </S>",
    "<S> the response of the accretion flow to perturbations includes weakly damped oscillatory modes . at sufficiently high luminosities </S>",
    "<S>  but still well below the eddington limit  the flows become unstable to aspherical perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> these unstable radiation hydrodynamic modes resemble the onset of convection , and allow accretion to occur preferentially through more rapidly descending columns of gas , while the radiation produced escapes through neighboring columns in which the gas descends more slowly .     * = `` 002a = ' ' 313f </S>"
