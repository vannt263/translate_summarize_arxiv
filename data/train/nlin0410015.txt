    "for such a setup , the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite provides a good description of the system , as long as the nonlinearity is not too large , as a study of the stability of linearized excitations around the gp solution has shown @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the @xmath0-kicked rotor has been realized with an ensemble of laser - cooled , cold atoms @xcite , or recently also with an ultracold bose - einstein condensate @xcite , periodically driven with a standing wave of laser light . with the wave number of the laser @xmath8 ,",
    "the experimental variables are easily expressed in our units by noting that momentum is usually measured in two photon recoils ( @xmath9 ) , and position in units of the inverse wave number of the standing wave ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "hence , the scaled variables @xmath11 and the physical ones @xmath12 are related by @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "our choice of units makes all the relevant quantities ( including the ones plotted in figures ) dimensionless .    owing to the periodicity of @xmath0-kick perturbation",
    ", the time @xmath15 is measured in number of periods @xmath16 and the evolution of the wave function of the system over a time interval @xmath16 is described by the operator @xmath17 .    a cubic modification of linear schrdinger dynamics for the @xmath0-kicked rotor may be accomplished by two different models , both considered in the present paper . the correct way to approximate",
    "the evolution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation is to evaluate the nonlinear term in the position representation @xcite . in the following",
    "we will refer to this first model as model 1 ( m1 ) .",
    "+ since the hamiltonian operator presents the time dependent nonlinear part @xmath18 , in the numerical integration of eq.([sch ] ) , the lowest order split method @xcite is used and @xmath19 is approximated by the time ordered product of evolution operators ( trotter - kato discretization @xcite ) on small time steps @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 integer ) : @xmath22 in the numerical simulations , we use a finite fourier basis of dimension @xmath23 : the discrete momentum eigenvalues lie on the lattice @xmath24 and the continuous angle variable is approximated by @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "shifting between the coordinate and momentum representations , in the evaluation of the operator @xmath27 , requires @xmath28 fast fourier transforms of @xmath23-dimensional vectors for each kick . in order to get stable numerical results ,",
    "the splitting interval @xmath20 has to be reduced when increasing the nonlinear coupling constant @xmath6 ; typical values of the number of steps per period range between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , investigating either the effects of strong nonlinearities or the dynamics of the system over long times is computationally quite expensive with ( m1 ) .",
    "a second model ( known as the kicked nonlinear rotator and called in the following model 2 ( m2 ) ) was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this model , being a much simpler variant of the kicked rotator model ( kr ) @xcite , allows to perform faster and more efficient numerical computations . + the evolution operator over one period @xmath16 for ( m2 ) is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 indicates the @xmath33-th component of the wave function of the system in the momentum representation .",
    "the change in the phase of each component @xmath32 of the state vector , introduced by the nonlinear term between two kicks , is proportional to the amplitude of the component . in ( m1 ) instead , the phase acquired at each instant by the wave function involves all the fourier components and the phase factor has as the @xmath33-th fourier component @xmath34 .",
    "the two models coincide only if the wave function of the system is a plane wave of fixed momentum ; in this case , the relation between the nonlinear coupling constants in ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) is @xmath35 . both models ( m1 ) and",
    "( m2 ) are nonlinear generalizations of the kr and reduce to the kr in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "depending on the commensurability of the period @xmath16 of the @xmath0-kick perturbation with @xmath37 , the kr displays different regimes , deeply studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the quantum resonant regime , corresponding to values of @xmath16 being rational multiples of @xmath37 , is characterized by a ballistic transport : the mean energy of the system grows according to a parabolic law @xcite . for generic irrational values of @xmath16",
    ", the average energy grows linearly in time only within a characteristic time ( break time ) , after which dynamical localization sets in and the diffusion is suppressed @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze in detail how the presence of the nonlinearity affects the general properties of transport in regimes that correspond to the localized ( section ii , which is essentially a warm up exercise in which the results of @xcite are reproduced and new numerical results about prefactor scaling is presented ) and resonant ( section iii ) one of the kr .",
    "we focus the attention on the growth exponent of the mean energy and on how the diffusion coefficient or the rate of ballistic transport depend on the strength of the nonlinear coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "while in sections ( ii ) and ( iii ) we are dealing with the evolution of an initial state with fixed momentum , chosen at @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 , section ( iv ) is devoted to the effects of a finite spread of initial conditions as strongly suggested by state - of - the - art experiments using ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "the quantity we typically compute is the width of the momentum distribution of the system @xmath40 , which gives the spreading of the wave packet over unperturbed levels or , equivalently , - apart from a constant factor 2 - the expectation value of the energy .",
    "the time - averaged spreading @xmath41 of the second moment has been frequently used ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , as it preserves the exponent of the power law growth , while smoothing out oscillations .    as pointed out in @xcite",
    "the nonlinear shift is essential in determining dynamical features ( providing for instance a mechanism for delocalization of the generic , irrational case ) , but when we deal with delocalized states it is typically quite small ( _ e.g. _ for ( m2 ) the shift is proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the width of the distribution over unperturbed states ) .",
    "so in general we may expect that , for moderate nonlinearities , the precise form of the shift does not alter in an essential way the nature of asymptotic motion .",
    "in this section , we consider the regime where the value of the period of the @xmath0-kick perturbation is incommensurate with @xmath37 . for better comparison",
    "we fix @xmath44 for all numerical computations shown in the following .",
    "the correspondent system in the @xmath36 limit is characterized by the phenomenon of dynamical localization @xcite caused by quantum interference effects .",
    "previous theoretical predictions and numerical simulations @xcite indicate that , above a critical border @xmath45 for the nonlinear coupling constant , dynamical localization is destroyed .",
    "the delocalization takes place in the form of anomalous subdiffusion with an exponent of @xmath46 : in @xcite an asymptotic law @xmath47 , ( where @xmath48 ) is predicted for both models ; this is confirmed for both models by the data reported in fig .",

    "the effect of the nonlinearity is the same for both models only at @xmath53 , because of the common initial state .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the way nonlinearity acts on the wave function is essentially different for ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) , at least before the state becomes delocalized : so deviations are qualitatively expected for intermediate times , while we expect a closer analogy in the models behavior in the asymptotic regime . actually the close behavior exhibited by both models in fig .",

    "asymptotically , however , the same ballistic growth of the mean square momentum is obtained .",
    "this means that the details of the effect of nonlinearity depend on the resonance type as far as the sign of @xmath6 is concerned .",

    "work is in progress to see whether there exist classical mappings that reproduce the peak dynamics we observe in intermediate time quantum behavior @xcite .",
    "all the above results have been obtained for an initial state in the form of a plane wave of null momentum . in a typical experiment , one can create a bose condensate with an initial spread of momentum which is much less than two photon recoils ( which can be imparted as momentum kicks to the atoms by the kicking laser ) .",

    "such a decomposition is not easily accomplished when we introduce a nonlinear term in the dynamics .",
