    "one missing piece for placing star formation within the broader context of galaxy evolution is the quantification of the feedback mechanisms between galactic  scale star formation and the host galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "one of the extant questions is : what are the regulating mechanisms for the production of structures at all scales ( associations , rings , bubbles , superbubbles ) ? in a star ",
    "formation event , stellar winds and supernova explosions from massive stars inject metals and kinetic energy into the surrounding ism .",
    "the energy injected may produce gas outflows and , in more extreme cases , superwinds @xcite , which may act as regulating mechanisms by removing gas from the site of star formation and quenching the star formation itself @xcite .",
    "such feedback mechanisms may have strong influence on the evolution of dwarf galaxies @xcite , although the exact details of the process are still uncertain and depend on the nature / geometry of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "ob associations will drive ionization and shock fronts through the ism that may in some cases cause the star formation to propagate spatially @xcite .    adding pieces to the puzzle requires exploring the feedback mechanisms on all scales , from the @xmath01001000  pc scales of superbubbles and outflows / superwinds down to the @xmath010  pc scales typical of the interfaces between the massive stars and the ionization and shock fronts .",
    "while the former has received the most attention in the past years because of its macroscopic effects on the host galaxy s ism @xcite , the latter has been so far only coarsely explored @xcite , despite its key role for understanding the large scale processes . in this paper , we employ hubble space telescope high angular ",
    "resolution images of nearby starburst galaxies to investigate the role of non  radiative ionization processes within and around sites of star formation .",
    "we quantify the amount of non  photoionized gas present in the starburst regions of these galaxies , investigate the influence of external environmental factors on the gas properties / structure , and relate the gas morphology to that of the young stellar populations .    throughout the paper , we define as ` photoionized ' the gas ionized by radiative processes , and as ` non  photoionized ' the gas ionized by any other mechanism .",
    "there are a number of processes other than radiative that can produce observable ionized gas in galaxies .",
    "shocks , and their precursors , from supernovae and massive star winds @xcite are a viable mechanism in the presence of intense star formation .",
    "alternative mechanisms are turbulent mixing layers @xcite and changes in the gas temperature .",
    "the latter has been invoked to explain the observed forbidden line ratios in galaxy haloes , at scale heights from @xmath01  kpc to 56  kpc above the galactic plane of the milky way and other quiescently star  forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the present analysis will not enable us to unambiguously discriminate between different non ",
    "photoionization processes ; we will tend to privilege the mechanical input from supernovae and massive star winds , thus shocks , as the simplest mechanism for driving non  photoionization and producing the observed morphology and scale ( a few 100  pc to @xmath0kpc ) of the non  photoionized gas in the starburst galaxies @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed justification for this choice is given in section  6.1 .",
    "one result of this study is that the non  photoionized gas represents a small fraction , about 3%4% , and possibly up to @xmath910%20% depending on the assumptions , of the integrated emission line spectrum in the starbursts .",
    "thus , the presence of non  photoionized gas will have small or negligible effect on the interpretation of diagnostics of distant galaxies",
    ". however , even such small fraction is key for tracing the location and morphology of possible large  scale shock structures in spatially resolved data .",
    "these structures indicate whether and where large amounts of mechanical energy are being deposited in the interstellar medium , and where larger - scale phenomena ( e.g. , superwinds ) may start .",
    "the sample consists of four starburst galaxies closer than 5  mpc , that we imaged in the light of hydrogen and metal forbidden line emission .",
    "the basic characteristics of the four galaxies are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "three of the galaxies , ngc3077 , ngc4214 , and ngc5253 , are dwarf irregulars ( m@xmath010@xmath10  m@xmath1 ) , with similar blue magnitudes , although with different metallicities and infrared  to  blue ratios .",
    "ngc4214 is a blue , relatively low  extinction , low ",
    "metallicity , and isolated galaxy .",
    "ngc5253 is likely in interaction with ngc5236 ( m83 ) ; although ngc5253 is as blue and as metal  poor as ngc4214 , it has about 60% more infrared emission than the latter , an indication of its higher dust content or concentration .",
    "ngc3077 is a member of the m81 group , forming a triplet together with m81 and m82 , and has a metallicity about 5 times higher than the other two dwarfs in the sample , with a value close to solar .",
    "ngc5236 , the galaxy in likely interaction with ngc5253 , is also in our sample , and is a massive ( m@xmath010@xmath11  m@xmath1 ) , grand ",
    "design , barred spiral , seen almost face  on .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 provides a brief description of the four galaxies in the sample .",
    "section  3 describes the observations and the data reduction , with emphasis on the derivation of emission  line images .",
    "section  4 presents the derivation of the line ratio images .",
    "section  5 describes how non  photoionized gas is discriminated from photoionized gas and presents the main findings of this work .",
    "section  6 discusses the results and section  7 summarizes them .",
    "ngc5253 is a benchmark starburst with centrally concentrated star formation superimposed on an older , quiescent stellar population .",
    "the galaxy is possibly in interaction with ngc5236 , given the small radial ( 500  kpc ) and projected ( 130  kpc ) distance between the two @xcite .",
    "a close encounter between the two galaxies about 1  gyr ago was first proposed by @xcite on the basis of various evidence , including the warping of the hi disk of ngc5236 @xcite .",
    "ngc5253 is at the same time a strong uv and fir emitter because the starburst s spectral energy distribution is very blue , but is also crossed by dust lanes that produce patchy obscuration @xcite .",
    "radio observations indicate that a large fraction of the most recent star formation is hidden by dust @xcite .",
    "the main e ",
    "w dust lane is also the location where weak co emission has been detected ; the lane has been suggested to be the funnel of accretion of unprocessed gas that is feeding the central starburst @xcite .",
    "gas ionization is centrally concentrated in this galaxy @xcite , and dominated in the optical by a 12  myr old , and possibly younger , super - star - cluster candidate heavily extincted by dust @xcite .",
    "this super - star - cluster candidate may be coincident with the brightest infrared source in the galaxy , as the two are only slightly displaced from each other , about 5  pc in projection @xcite .",
    "@xcite place the age of the super - star - cluster candidate at no more than a few hundreds of thousand years , based on its infrared properties .",
    "the uv  detected stellar clusters are systematically younger than @xmath020  myr @xcite , and are distributed amid a typically older , uv ",
    "bright , diffuse stellar population spread across the central @xmath9350  pc @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the cluster and diffuse populations suggest that the clusters may be dissolving into the diffuse population on timescales of a few tens of myr , due to tidal disruption , similar to what has been found in the center of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the velocity structure of the ionized gas becomes disturbed beyond @xmath0200  pc radius from the center , with velocity gradients of 1030  km  s@xmath12 , possibly a tracer of slowly expanding gas @xcite .",
    "based images show that gas ionized by mechanisms other than photoionization is present at least between 560  pc and @xmath01.4  kpc distance from the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the presence of two kpc  size superbubbles in the periphery of the ionized gas emission , roughly along the major and minor axis , respectively , one of which expanding with v@xmath035  km  s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the central region of the massive , metal  rich spiral ngc5236 is the site of a powerful starburst , although star formation is active across the entire body of the galaxy , along the spiral arms .",
    "the central starburst occupies a region about 400  pc across , and is bright at all wavelengths , from the x - ray to the radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two peaks of co emission , detected at the insertion points of the main stellar bar onto the outer circumnuclear ring @xcite , suggest a picture in which the starburst is fueled by gas inflow along the main stellar bar , collecting at the inner lindblad resonance ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , a central minibar connecting the outer circumnuclear ring to the inner circumnuclear ring may provide a further channel for the gas to fuel the starburst @xcite .",
    "the large amount of dust extinction , as inferred from infrared data @xcite and from the large infrared  to  blue ratio , is highly inhomogeneous , and multiple dust lanes criss  cross the central region of the galaxy , alternating heavily obscured with relatively unobscured regions .",
    "the population of uv  bright clusters in the galaxy center has a mean age peaked around 57  myr , and is distributed along the inner circumnuclear ring , in the shape of a semi ",
    "circular ringlet between 50  pc and 130  pc from the optical nucleus .",
    "clusters younger than @xmath05  myr are located at the edges of the ringlet , suggesting an outward propagation of star formation , but also propagation from the southern area of the ringlet towards the north @xcite .",
    "ground  based narrow ",
    "band imaging of the center of the galaxy shows that the distribution of the h@xmath5 emission follows closely that of the blue stars and that photoionization is the predominant ionization mechanism @xcite ; however , the coarse angular resolution of the ground  based images ( 1@xmath13.3@xmath030  pc ) has prevented establishing whether small  scale non ",
    "photoionized regions are present within / around the starburst site .",
    "ngc4214 is a blue , low ",
    "metallicity , wolf ",
    "rayet magellanic irregular @xcite .",
    "the low extinction values measured from optical spectroscopy @xcite , together with the low infrared  to  blue ratio , point consistently to a low dust content in the center of this galaxy .",
    "star formation is mainly active in two large complexes , altogether spanning a size of @xmath0900  pc , more than twice the size of the central site of star formation in ngc5253 .",
    "a few additional distinct actively star  forming regions are also present in the central area of the galaxy , along the main bar @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength observations indicate that star formation may have started a few times 10@xmath7  yr ago in this region @xcite .",
    "ngc4214 shows a large variety of young ( @xmath1410  myr ) star forming complexes , from obscured , filled compact hii regions to relatively unobscured , shell - like extended regions , which @xcite interpret as an evolutionary / aging trend .",
    "the brightest uv stellar knot in the starburst ( ngc42141 ) is relatively young , only @xmath045  myr old ; it is located at the southern edge of an h@xmath5 cavity , and is likely to be density bounded @xcite .",
    "several shells of expanding gas surround the main sites of star formation , with velocities between 30  km  s@xmath12 and 100  km  s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational interaction with m81 and m82 @xcite is the likely trigger of the starburst in the center of ngc3077 .",
    "the hi morphology of this galaxy is heavily disrupted by the interaction , with an extended tidal arm to the east of ngc3077 that contains about 90% of the atomic gas of the galaxy and is the site of a massive molecular complex @xcite .",
    "similarly to ngc5253 , star formation is centrally concentrated , and its optical morphology is heavily affected by patchy dust extinction .",
    "the dusty regions are fairly well traced by a number of co clouds , and their presence produces an offset between the optical center and the infrared center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the bright h@xmath5 core is surrounded by a number of expanding shells with velocities in the range 40100  km  s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the starburst hosts a number of stellar clusters covering a fairly large range of ages , mostly @xmath01100  myr , with a cluster as old as @xmath0300  myr @xcite .",
    "this agrees , as order of magnitude , with the estimates on the time since the last encounter of ngc3077 with m81 , that numerical simulations place at a few@xmath610@xmath8  yr ago @xcite .",
    "the images used in this work , all obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on - board the hst , are from a combination of new observations ( program ids 8234 and 9144 ) and old or archival data ( program ids 6124 , 6524 and 6569 ) , obtained during the period may 29 , 1995 through july 18 , 2001 .",
    "a summary of the filters and exposure times is given in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the focus of this work is on the ionized gas as probed by strong emission lines , thus the emphasis will be on the narrow - band filter observations , although observations in the medium / broad - band filters are also briefly discussed ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) , as they are used for stellar continuum - subtraction or for comparing the blue stellar population ( uv filters ) with the gas emission .    a subset of the emission - line data used here have been already presented and discussed in previous papers . @xcite use the hst h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 images of ngc  5253 to derive dust reddening maps .",
    "@xcite discuss the morphology of the h@xmath5 and [ oiii ]  @xmath155007     emission in ngc  4214 .",
    "@xcite present the hst h@xmath5 images of ngc  5236 , ngc  5253 and ngc  3077 for the purpose of constraining the ages of the stellar clusters in those galaxies , and use the reddening maps derived in the present work",
    ". the distinguishing characteristic of the present work relative to those previous ones is the study of the interstellar gas ionization mechanisms , rather than the investigation of the stellar population content of the galaxies ; thus , previous results will be used only as necessary .",
    "we add to previously published datasets images in the narrow - band filters corresponding to the line emission in [ sii ]  @xmath166726,6731     ( all galaxies ) , [ oiii ]  @xmath155007     ( ngc3077 , ngc5236 , and ngc5253 ) , and h@xmath4  @xmath154861     ( ngc3077 and ngc4214 ) . also , although @xcite presented h@xmath5 images for ngc3077 , ngc5236 , and ngc5253 , these were not discussed in detail .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] gives the full list of narrow- and medium / broad - band imaging for completeness .",
    "we performed anew the data reduction and combination of those datasets that had not been previously presented by us , to ensure homogeneity across the full suite of images .",
    "different programs used slightly different observing strategies , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall here those characteristics of relevance to the following analysis .",
    "the centers of the four galaxies were imaged in the wf3 chip ( 80@xmath1780@xmath13 , ngc3077 and ngc5253 ) , in the pc1 chip ( 36@xmath1736@xmath13 , ngc5236 ) , or straddling mainly the wf2 and wf3 chips ( ngc4214 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the selected wfpc2 chip contains the full central starburst region .",
    "in particular , the wf3 or full  wfpc2 fovs used for the three dwarf galaxies , ngc3077 , ngc4214 , and ngc5253 , subtend between 1.4  kpc and 2  kpc of the central regions , with ngc4214 being probed on the largest spatial scale ( column  6 of table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . in ngc5236 , the pc chip probes less than 1  kpc across the center ( column  6 of table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , still sufficient to cover the extent of the entire nuclear starburst and surrounding regions .",
    "program 9144 , whose scope was to observe ngc3077 and to complete the narrow - band datasets of ngc  4214 and ngc  5253 , was implemented to reproduce as closely as possible the pointings of the pre - existing images .",
    "typical rotations between narrow - band datasets for these galaxies were small , @xmath145@xmath18 .",
    "images from programs 6124 , 6524 and 9144 were dithered by a few pixels among exposures in the same filter , to easily remove hot pixels during the data combination steps .",
    "programs 6569 and 8234 did not employ a similar observing technique , and hot pixels were simply corrected for or flagged using the iraf / stsdas task warmpix .",
    "flagged data were not used in the analysis .",
    "observations of the emission lines used the same set of four narrow - band filters for all four galaxies , as redshifts are small enough that the lines fall within the filter bandpasses ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . for the v  band continuum , programs 6524 , 8234 , and 9144 used the medium band filter f547 m , as its bandpass excludes",
    "emission from strong lines , in particular the [ oiii ]  @xmath155007   ; program 6569 used the wider f555w filter as v  band continuum , and this case will be treated separately below .",
    "the data , both new and archival , were reduced by the stsci calibration pipeline , via the on - the - fly - reprocessing ( otfr , see @xcite ) .",
    "the otfr uses the best calibration reference files available at the time of retrieval from the hst archive ; most datasets were retrieved between mid2001 and early 2002 .",
    "the calibration pipeline performs basic steps such as flagging of bad pixels , a / d conversion , bias and dark current subtraction , flatfielding .",
    "post - processing steps performed by us included : identification / correction of hot pixels using the task warmpix , registration of each galaxy s dataset to a common position using rotations and linear shifts ; cosmic ray rejection , hot pixel rejection ( for dithered images ) , and combination using the iraf / stsdas task crrej .",
    "absolute photometric calibrations were applied to the images using the calibration keyword photflam included in the image headers . the zeropoint offsets ( drifts ) discussed in @xcite imply small corrections , @xmath03%   or less , to our absolute photometry .",
    "the effect of contaminant build - up onto the wfpc2 window is small or negligible at the optical wavelengths , but can be significant in the uv .",
    "observations in the most contamination  sensitive filter , f255w , were obtained about 23 days after decontamination , implying an efficiency loss of 11% ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ) . for observations in the other filters , most of them obtained within 7 days of decontamination , corrections are smaller , typically 12% or less , with only the f336w ( ngc4214 ) needing as much as a 3.8% correction .",
    "charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) corrections can in principle be severe in the narrow  band filters , where background and source counts tend to be low @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the problem is partially mitigated by the fact that the ` background ' is represented by the smooth galaxy s stellar population , as all our sample galaxies fill the wf or pc apertures . in the specific case of ngc4214",
    ", the pointing location was specifically chosen to minimize cte problems . in order to evaluate the impact of cte on our emission line measurements ,",
    "we examine the case of the f487n and f502n images of ngc5236 . these images / galaxy combinations are chosen because of the low ccd efficiency in the blue , of the high - angular resolution of the observations ( pc chip ) , and of the low observed h@xmath4 and [ oiii ]  @xmath155007     surface brightnesses .",
    "all these facts combine up to make the galaxy background ( @xmath00.55  dn / pix in f487n and @xmath00.84  dn / pix in f502n ) and source counts some of the lowest in our sample .",
    "thus , this case represents a reasonable upper limit to the impact of cte corrections in our images . using the formulae of @xcite , the loss in signal at the leading readout edge ( the west side of the galaxy )",
    "is about 15% and 13% in f487n and f502n , respectively ; the loss at the trailing edge is expected to be negligible , as our sources are extended @xcite .",
    "the line emission is more concentrated than the stellar continuum emission , and the leading edge is almost exclusively continuum ; the faint line emission at this edge will be excluded by our sensitivity cuts in the final images .",
    "a few pixels inside the leading edge , the ` background ' is already as high as @xmath03  dn / pix , which implies a cte loss of about 7%8% and 5%6% in f487n and f502n , respectively , for a typical source of 40  dn . to avoid undersubtracting the stellar continuum , we privilege the continuum levels at the trailing edge when performing the subtraction in the narrow  band filters ( see below ) . although cte is a systematic error , we quote the combined ` loss ' in the f487n and f502n filters , about 10% , as part of our random uncertainty when discussing the [ oiii]/h@xmath4 ratios , because of the difficulty of controlling continuum subtration at that level of accuracy .    a @xmath04@xmath64  pixel area in the f555w images of ngc4214 corresponding to knot i - as ( @xmath5(j2000)=12:15:39.441 , @xmath19(j2000)=36:19:34.99 , @xcite ) is saturated .",
    "the f555w image is used for the subtraction of the stellar continuum from the f502n and f487n line filters .",
    "uncorrected saturation leads to undersubtraction of the continuum and overestimate of the line strength in the saturated region . in the following analysis of emission lines in ngc4214 , the small saturated area will be neglected . in ngc5253 , the pixel corresponding to the peak of the f656n emission ( @xmath5(j2000)=13:39:56.016 , @xmath19(j2000)=@xmath331:38:25.05 , @xcite ) is saturated even in the shortest exposure .",
    "although @xcite attempts at correcting for the saturation in this pixel , we will ignore it in the following analysis .",
    "finally , all images were binned by 3x3 pixels ( 0@xmath13.3@xmath20 for ngc3077 , ngc4214 , and ngc5253 , and 0@xmath13.14@xmath20 for ngc5236 ) , to smooth out small registration shifts between images .",
    "the final bin size corresponds to a physical scale between 3  pc and 5.8  pc , depending on the galaxy and the chip used ( column  7 of table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "this scale is comparable or larger than the typical half  light radii of young stellar clusters in starbursts @xcite , but smaller than the typical diameters of hii regions , these being in the range @xmath950300  pc ( @xcite and references therein ) ; thus , the binning still preserves high enough spatial detail to investigate small  scale ionization characteristics .",
    "the most delicate post - processing step in the present work is the subtraction of the stellar continuum from the narrow  band images to produce emission ",
    "line  only images .",
    "this step is particularly tricky for the h@xmath4 and [ oiii ] images of ngc3077 and ngc5236 , owing to the unfavorable combination of weak lines ( due to the high metallicities and large dust reddening in the galaxies , table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , and low detector quantum efficiency of the wfpc2 at blue wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for these two galaxies , as well as for ngc5253 , we verified the correcteness of the continuum subtraction by comparing the wfpc2 line fluxes with the fluxes measured from the large  aperture spectra of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nebular emission lines contributing to the flux in each of the four narrow  band filters are listed in column  2 of table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "basically , each narrow  band filter is targeting a single major emission line , with the exception of f656n , which includes both h@xmath5 and [ nii ] .",
    "the subtraction of the [ nii ] contribution from the f656n flux will be discussed at length in section  3.1.2 .",
    "no additional nebular lines are expected to provide major contributions to the total flux in the filters .    for ngc5253 , stellar continuum images at the central wavelengths of the narrow  band filters",
    "were obtained by linear interpolation / extrapolation from the continuum f547 m and f814w images @xcite .",
    "re - scaling factors of 10% or less were then applied to the continuum images to match the intensity of stars in the narrow  band filters .",
    "the linear extrapolation of continuum images could not be applied to ngc3077 and ngc5236 , because of the significant small - scale color variations of the stellar populations . for these two galaxies , re - scaled f547 m and f814w frames were directly applied as continuum images to the f487n and f502n images and to the f656n and f673n images , respectively ; re - scaling factors were again selected to match the intensity of stars in the narrow  band frames . in ngc4214 , the f555w filter contains contributions from the [ oiii ]  @xmath155007     and the h@xmath5 emission ; the first line is located on the blue side of the filter s transmission curve , at 77% of the peak , while the second line is in the red wing , at 13% of transmission peak . a recursive technique , conceptually similar to that described in @xcite , is used to recover a pure stellar continuum image by iterative subtraction of the f502n and f656n images from the f555w image .",
    "the pure  stellar f555w image and the f814w image",
    "were then linearly interpolated / extrapolated to create the stellar continuum images at the appropriate wavelengths for the narrow band filters .",
    "the continuum  subtracted fluxes in the narrow  band images were compared with fluxes from ground  based spectra for ngc3077 , ngc5236 , and ngc5253 @xcite .",
    "the wfpc2 images were rotated to the standard n  e position , and the flux contained in an aperture corresponding to the spectral aperture was measured .",
    "the ground  based spectra were convolved with the wfpc2 narrow  band filter s spectral response , and continuum  subtracted .",
    "line fluxes agree within typically 10% between images and spectra for h@xmath5 , and h@xmath4 , and within @xmath015% for [ sii ] .",
    "discrepancies between images and spectral measurements are generally in the same direction for all lines in each galaxy , in the sense that for each galaxy the line fluxes from images will be either systematically higher or systematically lower than the fluxes from spectra .",
    "this characteristic greatly mitigates discrepancies , for the purpose of analyzing line ratios ( e.g. , [ oiii]/h@xmath4 or [ sii]/h@xmath5 ) .",
    "for the [ oiii ] line , agreement between imaging and spectroscopy fluxes is more variable , possibly owing to the large range of metallicities ( and thus , of [ oiii ] strength ) covered by our galaxies . in the low ",
    "metallicity , strong [ oiii ] emission galaxy ngc5253 the agreement between images and spectra is about 12% , which we consider good enough for our purposes . in the high  metallicity , weak [ oiii ] emission galaxies ngc3077 and ngc5236 , the [ oiii ] line fluxes in the images are about 30% and almost a factor of 2 higher , respectively , than the same lines in the spectra . because of their intrinsic weakeness , measurements of the spectroscopic [ oiii ] lines in these two galaxies are highly uncertain , and this may account for part of the discrepancy .",
    "attempts to bring the [ oiii ] fluxes in the ngc3077 and ngc5236 images into better agreement with the spectroscopic fluxes , e.g. , by increasing the amount of stellar continuum subtracted from the narrow  band image , have not been successful .",
    "the product is an obviously oversubtracted line image .",
    "the line images adopted in the analysis are those corresponding to the subtraction of the maximum continumm that does not produce obvious oversubtraction .",
    "the continuum  subtracted narrow  band images were then corrected for the throughput values of the filter transmission curves at the observed wavelength of the emission lines ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) . only in the case of the [ oiii ] and h@xmath5 emission in ngc5236",
    "are these corrections as high as 10% and 22.5% , respectively , substantially more than the few percent values that characterize all the other cases .",
    "ngc5236 is the galaxy with the highest redshift in our sample , and the [ oiii ] and h@xmath5 lines fall close to the red wing of the filters .",
    "such a large correction induces also a larger uncertainty in the final fluxes , that will be folded in the subsequent analysis .    to further test the correcteness of our continuum subtraction in the case of ngc5236",
    ", we checked the [ oiii]/h@xmath4 and [ sii]/h@xmath5 ratios measured from our images against the small  aperture spectroscopic results of @xcite ( for h@xmath5 , we first subtracted the [ nii ] contribution , see next section ) .",
    "these authors targeted the nucleus and a number of hii regions in the galaxy ; the line ratios we measure for the photoionized regions in the center of ngc5236 are consistent with those authors nuclear values .    in the case of ngc4214",
    ", we compared our h@xmath21[nii ] and [ oiii ] line photometry with the published values of @xcite for their regions  i and ii . to prevent biases in the results from differences in the centering of the apertures , we performed the comparison using only the large apertures listed in table  2 of @xcite , all of them with radius @xmath010@xmath13 or larger . for both lines ,",
    "our values are 26%28% systematically lower than @xcite s values , independently of the region used .",
    "since the data come from the same original images ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) , a possible explanation for the discrepancy is that we have performed a more stringent subtraction of the underlying continuum than those authors .    to verify that such discrepancy does not impact our conclusions on ngc4214 , the [ oiii]/h@xmath4 and [ sii]/h@xmath5 line ratios from our images were compared with the spectroscopic ratios of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our line ratios occupy , indeed , similar loci in the [ oiii]/h@xmath4versus[sii]/h@xmath5 and [ sii]/h@xmath5versus  h@xmath5  intensity planes as those from @xcite and @xcite , after accounting for differences in spatial resolution and depth between the images and the spectra .",
    "thus , our line emission images of ngc4214 can be considered adequate for the purpose of the following analysis .",
    "the contribution of the [ nii ]  @xmath156548     ( plus [ nii ]  @xmath156584     in ngc3077 ) to the f656n images has been removed using two different assumptions : ( 1 ) that the values measured from the large - aperture spectroscopy are a good representation of the average ( [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 ) ; ( 2 ) that the [ sii ] line emission map is a good tracer of the [ nii ] ( [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] ) .",
    "the second assumption stems from one main reason : the ratio [ nii]/[sii ] has been observed to remain relatively constant , with variations of a factor of 2 or less , in the diffuse ionized gas of a number of galaxy haloes @xcite , far less than the variation of [ nii]/h@xmath5 .",
    "the fact that [ nii]/[sii ] is relatively constant compared to [ nii]/h@xmath5 is due to two factors : ( a ) the lower dependence of [ nii]/[sii ] on abundance and ( b ) the lower sensitivity of [ nii]/[sii ] to the ionization properties of the extreme uv radiation field @xcite .",
    "thus , the assumption of a constant [ nii]/h@xmath5 ratio is an over - simplification , which may impact the h@xmath5 flux determinations in low ",
    "excitation regions , where the [ nii]/h@xmath5 ratios are expected to be high .",
    "we discuss here both methods as a way to bracket extremes in the line ratio values , and evaluate their impact on our conclusions .    the first assumption for the [ nii]-subtraction is of straightforward application to our data .",
    "for ngc4214 , for which we do not have a large - aperture optical spectrum , we have adopted the same [ nii]/h@xmath5 ratio as in ngc5253 ; this is justified by the similar metallicity and ionization conditions of the two galaxies ( table  [ tbl-1 ] and section  4 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] reports the fractional contribution of [ nii ] to the f656n flux for each galaxy , as calculated from the large aperture spectra .",
    "the only case in which the [ nii ] correction to the f656n images is significantly above a few percent is ngc5236 , owing to its high metallicity .",
    "ngc3077 is also an above  solar metallicity galaxy , with [ nii]/h@xmath230.33 ; however , because of the low redshift of the galaxy , the two [ nii ] lines fall in the wings of the f656n filter , providing a very small contribution to the total flux .    for the second [ nii]-subtraction assumption ,",
    "we have generated ` [ nii ] ' images that are proportional to the [ sii ] images , with the proportionality constant derived from the ground  based spectra of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "new h@xmath5 emission line maps have then been created after subtraction from the f656n images of the ` [ nii ] images ' .",
    "the difference between these h@xmath5 images and those created under the first assumption is rather small , @xmath142% , for ngc4214 and ngc5253 , and @xmath243.5% for ngc3077 .",
    "it is , however , significant in ngc5236 , where differences up to a factor 2.8 in the h@xmath5 fluxes of the low  ionization regions are observed between the two methods . in the following , we adopt the h@xmath5 maps obtained from the [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] assumption as our default , but recall the h@xmath5 from the [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 assumption whenever relevant to bracket the parameters range in ngc5236 .",
    "once h@xmath5`only ' emission line images have been created , the h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 fluxes are corrected for the effects of the underlying stellar absorption , in order to fully recover the nebular fluxes .",
    "the weak h@xmath4 is more affected than h@xmath5 by this problem , but the images of both lines have been corrected .",
    "we have adopted a value of ew@xmath25ew@xmath26=2     for our galaxies @xcite , which is representative of the values measured in hii regions and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the correction is performed as follows .",
    "the emission line images are divided by the appropriate stellar continuum image to create images of the line equivalent width ( ew ) , for all bins above a 5  @xmath27 threshold .",
    "the bin values in each ew image are then increased by 2    , and new line fluxes are computed based on the revised ews . the resulting emission line h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 images are used throughout this paper .",
    "maps of the line ratios [ oiii]/h@xmath4 , [ sii]/h@xmath5 , and h@xmath5/h@xmath4 are created for each galaxy from the line images , after selecting only the data above the 5  @xmath27 threshold in each image ( table  [ tbl-3 ] for a list of the 1  @xmath27 flux levels in each line image ) .",
    "the threshold is chosen so to avoid that our results are dominated by sources of random or systematic error .",
    "the h@xmath5/h@xmath4 maps are used to apply pixel - by - pixel dust reddening corrections to fluxes , surface brightnesses , luminosities , and the metal line ratios .",
    "these corrections are typically small for the metal line ratios , owing to the proximity in wavelength of h@xmath4 to [ oiii ] and of h@xmath5 to [ sii ] . for the same reason",
    ", our simplistic assumption that the dust is located in a foreground screen is not affecting these line ratios in a measurable way .",
    "however , fluxes , surface brightnesses , and luminosities will be more influenced by variations in the dust amount along the line of sight . in particular",
    ", global values will be somewhat underestimated , because in regions of high dust content the assumption of foreground dust will provide insufficient corrections , and/or the hydrogen emission lines will be undetected altogether . in what follows , the impact of dust on these quantities and our results will be evaluated on a case - by - case basis .",
    "line intensity and ratio maps for the four galaxies are shown in figures  [ fig1][fig4 ] , panels b  d .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the histograms of the area occupied by different values of the metal line ratios , [ oiii]/h@xmath4 and [ sii]/h@xmath5 , for each of the four galaxies .",
    "the peak in each histogram marks the completeness limit of the line ratio , as verified by the following experiment .",
    "histograms of the [ sii]/h@xmath5 line ratios were produced at two different sensitivity thresholds , 5  @xmath27 and 3  @xmath27 ; as expected in the case of a selection effect ( completeness limit ) , the histogram peaks moved to higher values of [ sii]/h@xmath5 for the deeper images .",
    "as an additional experiment , the sensitivity cut was pushed to lower values by selecting a 3  @xmath27 threshold in images binned by 5@xmath65  pixels ( rather than our adopted 3@xmath63  pixels bins ) ; the histogram from these deeper images reinforced the trend of the previous ones , thus confirming the selection effect nature of the peaks . despite this effect ,",
    "comparisons among the line ratio histograms of the four galaxies are still meaningful , as similar depths are achieved between images of the same emission line ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .    in the case of [ sii]/h@xmath5 ( figure  [ fig5 ] , left panel )",
    ", the value of the peak is similar for all four galaxies ; this is due to the low sensitivity of the line ratio to metallicity ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) and to the hardness of the ionizing radiation field ( for high ionization parameter values , @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , in the case of [ oiii]/h@xmath4 ( figure  [ fig5 ] , right panel ) the position of the peak changes from galaxy to galaxy , due to the high sensitivity of this line ratio to the galaxy s metal content and radiation field s hardness .",
    "for example , for fixed ionizing field and ionization parameter , [ sii]/h@xmath5 varies by a factor @xmath06 across the entire metallicity range ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) ; in the same conditions , [ oiii]/h@xmath4 varies by a factor @xmath9150 @xcite . for fixed metallicity , e.g. 20% the solar oxygen abundance , a decrease of 25% in the effective temperature of the ionizing source produces a change of 30% or less in the [ sii]/h@xmath5 ratio , and a far larger decrease , a factor @xmath02.5 or larger , in the [ oiii]/h@xmath4 ratio , for ranges of the ionization parameter typical of star  forming regions ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter example helps explain the case of ngc4214 and ngc5253 : the two galaxies have almost identical metallicities but slightly different peaks in the [ oiii]/h@xmath4 histogram .",
    "likely , the ionizing sources in ngc5253 are harder , i.e. , stars have higher effective temperatures on average , than those in ngc4214 .",
    "this could be accomplished if photoionization were dominated by somewhat younger ( by a few myr ) stars or star clusters in ngc5253 than in ngc4214 .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite diagnostic diagrams provide an excellent means of classifying galaxies according to their excitation mechanism .",
    "these diagrams are composed of easily measured line ratios : log([oiii]/h@xmath4 ) line ratio on the y - axis against log([nii]/h@xmath5 ) , log([sii]/h@xmath5 ) , or log([oi]/h@xmath5 ) on the x - axis .",
    "starbursts fall onto the lower left - hand region of these plots , while narrow - line seyferts are located in the upper right and liners lie in the lower right hand zone . the log([sii]/h@xmath5 ) ratio has traditionally been used as a diagnostic for shock - excited gas and for the identification of supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "shock models predict that relatively cool high - density regions form behind the shock front and emit strongly in [ sii ] @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite combined stellar population synthesis modeling with the mappings  iii photoionization and shock code @xcite to produce starburst grids on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams .",
    "these grids were produced for a wide range of metallicities ( z=@xmath29solar ) and ionization parameters ( @xmath30cm / s , where @xmath31 is linked to the nondimensional ionization parameter u by : u=@xmath32 ) . using these grids , @xcite established an upper boundary on the diagrams called the ` maximum starburst line ' . the flux ratios of any object lying above this boundary can not be modelled by pure starburst models alone .",
    "such ratios require the additional contribution by a harder ionizing source like an agn or shock excitation . in a sense ,",
    "the use of this maximum starburst line is conservative because some objects lying to the left and below the line may have a non - negligible component of non - photoionization .",
    "indeed , the mixing line in @xcite shows that objects lying just to the left of the maximum starburst line in the log([oiii]/h@xmath4 ) versus log([sii]/h@xmath5 ) diagram may have a contribution of up to @xmath030% of non - photoionization to their emission . on the other hand , the maximum starburst line is useful for our purposes because any point in our sample lying to the right of the maximum starburst line is very likely to be dominated by non  photoionization processes .    comparisons with shock models",
    "confirm the above statement .",
    "the locus of shock models by @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig7 ] , denoted by an s ; these models include ionization from both the shock and the photoionized precursor .",
    "the photoionized precursor is a region of gas in front of the shock which has been ionized by the radiation field emitted by the high - density gas at the shock front .",
    "a similar locus is occupied by the shock models of @xcite .",
    "this lends support to the fact that points lying above and to the right of the maximum starburst line are likely to be dominated by shock emission or other non  photoionization process .",
    "although the maximum starburst line was derived for discriminating the main ionization mechanisms in ` whole ' galaxies , we apply it to our spatially`resolved ' analysis of the excitation mechanisms within starbursts as a conservative approach to the problem .",
    "using our data , we have therefore constructed diagnostic diagrams log([oiii]/h@xmath4 ) versus log([sii]/h@xmath5 ) for each galaxy ( figure  [ fig7 ] , where the data points are bins from the line ratio images ) ; photoionization models from @xcite at the appropriate metallicity for each galaxy are reported in each panel , together with the maximum starburst line .    despite our conservative approach ,",
    "both ngc5236 and ngc5253 show clear evidence for the presence of a number of regions dominated by non",
    " photoionization processes ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) , that is , lying above the maximum starburst line .",
    "the situation is less clear for ngc4214 and ngc3077 , and two considerations should be kept in mind :    1 .",
    "the 5@xmath27 flux cut affects the locus of the bins on figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "we show ngc4214 and ngc3077 in figure  [ fig8 ] with 3@xmath27 cuts .",
    "it is clear that there are more data points in the non  photoionized region of the diagram than there were in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "this is expected as non ",
    "photoionized gas tends to occupy low surface brightness regions . a similar increase in the non ",
    "photoionized data points is observed in ngc5253 and ngc5236 when 3@xmath27 cuts are chosen in their images .",
    "the parameter range covered by the data points in figure  [ fig7 ] is limited by the comparatively shallow [ oiii ] and h@xmath4 images ; in the specific case of ngc3077 and ngc4214 , the images are probably not deep enough to extensively probe non  photoionized regions , when using a 5  @xmath27 sensitivity cut . indeed , the deeper [ sii ] and h@xmath5 images show that a larger fraction of bins have [ sii]/h@xmath330.70.9 for all four galaxies ( e.g. , figure  [ fig5 ] , left panel , and figure  [ fig10 ] ) than is apparent from the diagnostic diagram of figure  [ fig7 ] ; such high ratios are tell  tale signs of non  radiative processes @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of our analysis , regions of non  photoionization ( figures  [ fig1][fig4 ] , panels  e ) are defined to satisfy at least one of the following two conditions : ( 1 ) the line ratios in the regions are above / right of the ` maximum starburst line ' ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) ; ( 2 ) the [ sii]/h@xmath5 ratio is high enough to be compatible with non ",
    "photoionization processes ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) .    for ngc5236",
    ", we investigate also the impact of the adopted [ nii]subtraction method for the h@xmath5 images on the discrimination between photoionized and non  photoionized regions .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the effect on the diagnostic diagram of each of the two assumptions : [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] ( the default in all figures ) or [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 . the first assumption clearly causes more data bins to be located in the non  photoionized area of the diagnostic diagram .",
    "its main effect on the non ",
    "photoionzed regions is to make them more extended , rather than ` creating ' new ones .",
    "in addition , the two assumptions produce nearly identical integrated h@xmath5 fluxes , with the flux from the [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] assumption being only 2% smaller than with the other assumption ; this implies a negligible impact on the integrated luminosities and derived quantities in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "the two methods give similar results in terms of the _ number and overall morphology _ of the non ",
    "photoionized regions , but other quantities related to those regions , like the h@xmath5 flux , the size , and the areal fraction , do change and , in particular , they decrease in value for the case [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 .",
    "although our default assumption , [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] , is the most physically justified ( see discussion and references in section  3.1.2 ) , we report in table  [ tbl-5 ] also the numbers from the assumption [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 , to highlight the differences between the two methods for ngc5236 ( see also discussion below ) .",
    "non - radiative ionization is typically confined to regions of low h@xmath5 surface brightness , as already observed by other authors for these and other galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the distribution of values of [ sii]/h@xmath5 as a function of the normalized h@xmath5 surface brightness , @xmath34/@xmath35 .",
    "@xmath35 is defined as the mean surface brightness at the half  light radius ( @xcite and table  [ tbl-4 ] ) . the [ sii]/h@xmath5versus  h@xmath5 plot show a relatively uniform behaviour across the four galaxies .",
    "the photoionized gas , identified by the low  valued [ sii]/h@xmath5 , spans the full range of surface brightness in each galaxy ( modulo the sensitivity limits of our images ) , while the non  photoionized gas crowds in the low  surface  brightness / high  [ sii]/h@xmath5 locus of the diagram .",
    "conversely , the plot of [ oiii]/h@xmath4 as a function of the normalized h@xmath5 surface brightness differs markedly from galaxy to galaxy ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) . in ngc5236 , the high h@xmath5  surface  brightness regions ( hii regions ) are characterized by low values of the ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath4 , lower than the values found in the low surface brightness areas .",
    "the trend is clearly opposite in ngc4214 and ngc5253 , where high surface brightness regions have consistently high values of [ oiii]/h@xmath4 .",
    "the datapoints of ngc3077 show a trend that is in  between those of ngc5236 and ngc4214/ngc5253 . at the high end of the h@xmath5 surface brightness ( @xmath34/@xmath363 )",
    ", there is a factor 60 or more difference in [ oiii]/h@xmath4 values between the four galaxies , showing that the [ oiii]/h@xmath4versus  h@xmath5  surface  brightness plot is heavily affected by the galaxy s metallicity , with a clear trend going from the metal ",
    "rich ngc5236 , through ngc3077 , down to the metal ",
    "poor ngc4214 and ngc5253 .",
    "at the same time , the plot shows more uniform values at the low  surface  brightness end ( @xmath34/@xmath370.5 ) , where non  photoionized gas is present ; here , the [ oiii]/h@xmath4 ratio spans a factor less than 5 between the four galaxies .    under our assumptions , in all four galaxies the fraction of h@xmath5 emission contributed by mechanisms other than photoionization is modest , around 3%4% ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) . in ngc5236 , this fraction becomes noticeably lower , about 1% , when the [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 assumption , rather than the default [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] , is adopted .",
    "in order to extract the largest possible fraction of non  photoionized gas from the images , we use the 3  @xmath27 line ratio images to derive the values reported in table  [ tbl-5 ] , columns 25 . if the 5  @xmath27 line ratio images are instead used , the numbers in columns  25 of table  [ tbl-5 ] for ngc3077 , ngc4214 , and ngc5253 drop by fractions that range between 30% and 65% , with negligible changes in the case of ngc5236 .",
    "the use of the 3  @xmath27 images , rather than the 5  @xmath27 ones , is preferred in this case for a more meaningful comparison with predictions from models ( see section  6 ) .",
    "most of the data points for all four galaxies are in the ` photoionzed gas ' part of the diagnostic diagram ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the low[sii]/h@xmath5 points of ngc4214 and ngc5253 are compatible with the tracks for gas at the measured metallicity ( and harder radiation spectrum for ngc5253 ) .    for ngc3077 , the low  valued [",
    "sii]/h@xmath5 points have lower [ oiii]/h@xmath4 than expected from models at the galaxy s metallicity ( left - top panel of figure  [ fig7 ] ) ; a track closer to the observed data points is the one at z=2  z@xmath1 , with gas density n=350  @xmath38 .",
    "however , even this track does not fully account for the distribution of the data points in ngc3077 , especially those located below the track itself .",
    "a starburst population comprising of ionizing stars in a range of evolutionary stages , and a combination of high and low  ionization components , may account for the dispersion of the datapoints in the low[oiii]/h@xmath4/low[sii]/h@xmath5 part of the diagram @xcite .",
    "the z=2  z@xmath1 , n=350  @xmath38 track is located well below the maximum starburst line ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) ; if the track itself is used as a boundary to separate photoionized gas ( below  left of the track ) from non  photoionized gas ( top  right of the track ) in ngc3077 , we get that the h@xmath5 emission of the non  photoionized gas is 26% of the total .",
    "this fraction is 6 times higher than what we calculate under the ` standard ' assumptions above , and it is also over 4 times larger than what the starburst itself can support if all its mechanical energy is used to shock the gas ( table  [ tbl-6 ] ) .",
    "thus , the distribution of the data points in the [ oiii]/h@xmath4versus[sii]/h@xmath5 diagram for ngc3077 appears to be due to a combination of multiple processes , which possibly include the high and low  ionization components of @xcite , in addition to a non  photoionized component .    in ngc5236",
    "we find an even more extreme behavior than in the case of ngc3077 . while the low[sii]/h@xmath5 points are in the general region of the high  metallicity theoretical tracks for photoionized gas , they do not follow any specific track in this galaxy ( top  right panel in figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the qualitative trend of the data does not change if the h@xmath5 images are corrected for [ nii ] using the assumption [ nii]@xmath22h@xmath5 , rather than [ nii]@xmath22[sii ] ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "one possible interpretation is that , in addition to the presence of a complex age distribution in the starburst stellar population and of regions of low and high ",
    "ionization @xcite , non  photoionized processes heavily affect the weak metal line ratios in this metal  rich galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the emission may result from a shock  only component ( without a photoionized precursor ) , as the ones modelled by @xcite .",
    "this can occur if the shock is propagating into a low density environment like the neutral interstellar medium , or if we are in the presence of low  velocity shocks .",
    "thus , the difference in line emission characteristics between the giant spiral and the three dwarfs may arise from the uniqueness of nuclear environments . if the z=2  z@xmath1 , n=350  @xmath38 track is again used as a boundary between photoionized gas and non  photoionized gas , the fraction of h@xmath5 emission associated with the non ",
    "photoionized component increases to @xmath09% , about three times larger than what derived with our ` standard ' assumptions .",
    "this more extreme scenario is still , although barely , energetically supportable by the current starburst ( table  [ tbl-6 ] ) .",
    "morphologically , in the more extreme scenario the two regions  a and b merge together and region  a gets extended along areas of low h@xmath5 surface brightness towards the nucleus of ngc5236 .    in summary , even under less restrictive assumptions for the identification of non  photoionized gas ,",
    "the photoionized gas still accounts for the majority of the h@xmath5 emission , at the level of at least @xmath075% and @xmath090% in ngc3077 and ngc5236 , respectively .",
    "not surprisingly , the geometry of the photoionizing sources is more complex than just a simple central point source , in all four galaxies .",
    "this is easily seen in figure  [ fig5 ] , left panel , where the expected trend of areal coverage as a function of [ sii]/h@xmath5 is shown for a central point  like source ; the line ratio in the case of a central source is a function of the radial distance r from the source itself , [ sii]/h@xmath39r@xmath20 . in all cases , the observed areal coverage exceeds the prediction from the single central source , clearly showing that the ionizing sources are distributed across the entire starburst region , as already evident from the uv images of the same galaxies ( figures  [ fig1][fig4 ] , panels  a , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , deviations from the single point - like source geometry happen at radii smaller than 1736  pc for the four galaxies , where the radii increase from ngc5236 , to ngc4214 , ngc5253 , and ngc3077 ; this fact is compatible with the presence of multiple ionizing clusters distributed within the starburst region with intracluster distances typical of the sizes of hii regions .",
    "indeed , each ` transition ' radius is much smaller than the radius of the stromgn sphere and of the uv half  light radius ( table  [ tbl-4 ] , even after the uv half  light radius is corrected for residual effects of dust obscuration , see section  6.3 ) , the latter confirming the spatially extended nature of the starburst population in each galaxy .",
    "the morphologies of the non ",
    "photoionized regions can offer clues as to the mechanism underlying the observed ionization . here",
    "we review the various structures observed in the four sample galaxies .",
    "they show two basic morphologies : cavities or ` enclosed ' regions and shell ( with more or less filamentary structure ) regions .    the cavities ( e.g. , regions a and b in ngc5236 , figure  [ fig3 ] , and region  as in ngc4214 , figure  [ fig2 ] ) are areas of low h@xmath5 surface brightness surrounded by actively star  forming knots or regions , the latter with marked high h@xmath5 surface brightness .",
    "the radii of the non ",
    "photoionized regions range , in our cases , from @xmath020  pc to @xmath050 pc .",
    "the h@xmath5 shells surround the central starburst , and have more or less marked filamentary structure .",
    "they often trace the closest edge of more external bubbles or arcs to the central peak of star  formation . in our three dwarf galaxies ,",
    "these regions are located at a radius of @xmath00.2  kpc from the area of peak star  formation . in ngc3077 and ngc5253 , these radii are a factor @xmath02 larger than the h@xmath5 half  light radii ( cf . table  [ tbl-4 ] with table  [ tbl-5 ] ) , and are also larger than the uv half  light radii or the stromgn radii , even after accounting in the latter for the uncertainties in the filling factor and gas density . in ngc4214 , the size of the non  photoionized",
    "shell is smaller than both the h@xmath5 and the uv half  light radii .    in ngc5236",
    "there is one additional concentration of non  photoionized gas ( region  c ) , located at the periphery of the central starburst , on the southern side .",
    "this region appears to coincide with the point of insertion of the main stellar bar onto the outer circumnuclear ring @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is no similarly obvious non  photoionization region close to the other insertion point ( i.e. , close to the other co region as marked in figure  [ fig3 ] , panel  e ) .",
    "likely , the extinction due to the dust lane that dominates this other area has prevented a detection .",
    "the pc chip image of ngc4214 contains a non  photoionization region with a markedly annular geometry , of physical radius of @xmath040  pc and thickness of @xmath020  pc .",
    "this h@xmath5 ring is located in a fairly isolated area , devoid of other h@xmath5 emitting regions and is not surrounded by knots of active star formation , as the other cavities discussed above .",

    "the areal coverage of non  photoionized gas in the four galaxies is between 15% and 25% of the total h@xmath5 area , thus much larger than the fraction by flux , as emission due to processes other than photoionization is associated in general with regions of low h@xmath5 surface brightness ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) .    even making allowances for the fact that our observations may not cover the full extent of the diffuse h@xmath5 emission in the four galaxies",

    "the h@xmath5 emission expected as a result of the starburst s mechanical output , l@xmath49 , is derived adopting the @xcite prescription : l@xmath500.025  l@xmath51 , where l@xmath51 is the mechanical luminosity produced by the starburst . to derive the latter",
    ", we adopt the starburst99 models @xcite .",
    "in particular , each starburst is assumed to be well described by continuous star formation in the range 10100  myr , and salpeter stellar initial mass function up to 100  m@xmath1 .",
    "each galaxy is matched to the model closest in metallicity value .",
    "the number of ionizing photons predicted by the starburst99 models are rescaled to match the observed photoionized h@xmath5 luminosity ( table  [ tbl-4 ] , after subtraction of the non ",

    "the rescaling factors are then used to derive the expected mechanical luminosities l@xmath51 for each starburst , and , finally , the expected l@xmath49 and their fraction to the total h@xmath5 luminosity ( table  [ tbl-6 ] ) .",
    "the values of l@xmath49/l@xmath52 listed in table  [ tbl-6 ] represent therefore the expected fractions of h@xmath5 luminosity that the four starbursts can produce via shocks triggered by massive star winds and supernovae , and should be compared with the observed non ",
    "photoionized h@xmath5 luminosity fractions measured from our 3  @xmath27 images ( table  [ tbl-5 ] , column  4 ) .",
    "we prefer the use of the 3  @xmath27 images for this part of the analysis , instead of our default 5  @xmath27 images , as higher sensitivity cuts tend to exclude low surface brightness regions , and , therefore , exclude preferentially the non",
    " photoionized areas in the images .",
    "a quantification of how much non  photoionization is excluded by the 5  @xmath27 images is given in section  5.1 .",

    "photoionized h@xmath5 luminosities , implying that the mechanical energy input into the ism from supernovae and high  mass star winds is sufficient to produce the level of non  photoionization observed in all four galaxies , if star formation has been constant over the last @xmath0few  10@xmath7  yr . in the case of the massive galaxy ngc5236 ,",
    "a starburst as young as 10  myr can already account for the observed l@xmath53 , and an older starburst could produce even larger mechanical h@xmath5 luminosities .",
    "for the three dwarf galaxies , the observed l@xmath53 fall closer to the high range of predicted values l@xmath49 from models . in the starburst99 models , the ratio of the mechanical energy output to the number of ionizing photons ( and therefore to the photoionized h@xmath5 emission ) , l@xmath51/n@xmath54 , reaches a constant value after @xmath03@xmath610@xmath7  yr , for constant star formation .",
    "this implies that the starbursts in the three dwarfs need to have produced stars at the same rate as ( or higher than ) the present one for at least 30  myr , to account for the observed l@xmath53 .",
    "this is likely to be the case for our dwarf galaxies ( section  6.4 ) .",
    "overall , shocks are a viable mechanism , from an energetic point  of  view , for the observed luminosity of the non  photoionized gas in the center of all four galaxies .",
    "the near  uv emission from the galaxies probes the radiative output from stars more massive than @xmath05  m@xmath1 , and thus can be used as a tracer of the mechanical output from the starburst on timescales of a few hundred million years ( with assumptions on the star",
    " formation history ) , much longer than the ` instantaneous ' output traced by the h@xmath5 emission .",
    "the reddening  corrected near - uv fluxes , luminosities , and corresponding mechanical luminosities of the four galaxies predicted by the starburst99 models are listed in table  [ tbl-6 ] .    for all galaxies ,",
    "l@xmath49 derived from the near  uv emission is in very good agreement with the same quantity derived from the photonionized h@xmath5 , despite uncertainties in the dust extinction correction of both the uv and h@xmath5 images ( especially in the high  opacity co regions ) . to estimate the potential impact of the latter , we consider the cases of ngc5253 and ngc3077 .",
    "the basic premise is that heavy dust extinction will preferentially affect the central , photoionization  dominated regions of the starbursts .",
    "dust opacity indicators , such as the uv slope and the infrared - to - uv or infrared - to - blue ratios @xcite , give average uv attenuations a@xmath551.1  mag and a@xmath561.4  mag , for the starburst regions of ngc5253 and ngc3077 , respectively ; these are factors 2 and 2.2 higher , respectively , than what we derive directly from our h@xmath5/h@xmath4 images .",
    "using the same dust diagnostics , the average attenuation at h@xmath5 in the centers of ngc5253 and ngc3077 is a factor 1.4 and 1.8 higher , respectively , than what estimated from our optical images . even if all the ` extra ' dust attenuation is associated with the photoionized gas for both galaxies , the revised numbers for the intrinsic l@xmath52 and , therefore , for the expected l@xmath51 , provide a l@xmath49 luminosity that is at most 6% and 13% of the total _ measured _",
    "luminosity in ngc5253 and ngc3077 , respectively .",
    "this fraction will decrease if any of the ` extra ' dust is associated with the non ",

    "scale h@xmath5 emission ( both photoionized and non ) needs to be included in the full budget accounting .",
    "for this purpose , we combine the present results for ngc5253 with those of @xcite .",
    "our hst images and their ground  based images probe complementary regions in this galaxy in terms of non  photoionization ( the hst images being at higher angular resolution , but shallower than the ground  based images ) .",

    "the sum of the non ",
    "photoionized h@xmath5 from this work and that of calzetti et al .",

    "incidentally , even on this extended spatial scale , l@xmath53/l@xmath600.03 .",
    "therefore , the measured luminosity of the non  photoionized gas is still perfectly supportable by the current starburst .",
    "we can expect that a similar argument holds for ngc3077 .",

    "photoionized gas ( figure  [ fig3 ] , panel  e ) .",
    "the non  photoionized gas is mainly concentrated in two localized regions surrounded by star - forming areas , except for a sourthen concentration which corresponds to the insertion of the stellar bar into the outer circumnuclear ring ( section  5.2 )",
    ". more generally , @xcite found , based on ground  based images , that there is little or no evidence for diffuse ionized gas extended beyond the regions occupied by the ionizing stars .",
    "their conclusion is supported by our data .",
    "the central starburst in ngc5236 is somewhat more compact than the starbursts in ngc5253 and ngc3077 , as inferred from both the h@xmath5 and uv half  light radii ( table  [ tbl-4 ] ) , and is only 15% more powerful than the starburst in ngc5253 ( see the star formation rates in table  [ tbl-4 ] ) .",
    "if comparable starbursts produce extended gas structures of comparable sizes , we may expect such structures to be located at a distance @xmath0200250  pc from the nucleus of ngc5236 ( table  [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "our pc observations are sensitive enough and sample enough region , @xmath0750  pc , to detect extended gas structures in ngc5236 , if present ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . however , like @xcite , we do not detect ionized gas extended beyond the region occupied by the starburst stellar population .",
    "those authors concluded that the absence of an extended ionized gas component is evidence of the gas confinement exerted by the deep potential well in the center of ngc5236 .",
    "@xcite did not detect any non  photoionized gas in the center of the galaxy , probably due to the lower angular resolution of the ground  based images .",
    "the fact that we do detect localized non ",
    "photoionized gas in ngc5236 , while still failing to detect a gas component extended beyond the starburst stellar population , is further support that the starburst in this galaxy is a local event and has little influence on the large  scale galaxy s ism .",
    "the h@xmath5 luminosity associated with the non  photoionized gas in the two cavities in ngc5236 is 5.4@xmath610@xmath61  erg  s@xmath12 for region  a and 1.4@xmath610@xmath61  erg  s@xmath12 for region  b , accounting for 58% of the total non ",

    "if those cavities are actually due to mechanical input from a single cluster each , such clusters would be a few times more massive than the current population of young stellar clusters in the center of ngc5236 @xcite , but still within the mass range of young stellar clusters in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , a few clusters in each region could be responsible for the powering of the cavities ; the structure of the starburst in this galaxy already provides morphological evidence for young stellar clusters to amass in groups of 24 in localized regions of projected size 3040  pc @xcite .",
    "these sizes fit confortably within the area occupied by each of the two cavities .",
    "the well  known central h@xmath5 cavity in ngc4214 @xcite is edged to the south by the brightest h@xmath5 knot in the galaxy .",
    "however , the brightest uv cluster , ngc4214 - 1 , does not coincide with the bright h@xmath5 knot , but is located to the ne of it , within the cavity @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the cavity is @xmath07@xmath13 diameter , or @xmath0100  pc ; this is about 50% larger than the size of the non  photoionization region detected in our images ( diameter@xmath070  pc , table  [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy is likely to be physical : the edges of the cavity may be dominated by the photoionization that is induced , possibly , by ngc4214 - 1 .",
    "this stellar cluster , at 45  myr of age @xcite , is old enough to have experienced the first supernova explosions ( that start around @xmath03.5  myr , @xcite ) , and thus to be the cause of the detected non ",
    "photoionized gas within the cavity .",
    "the cavity s dynamical age is @xmath00.4  myr , adopting the velocity v=70  km  s@xmath12 measured in @xcite ; the stellar cluster was at most 0.5  myr younger when the bubble started to form , old enough to have experienced @xmath0200700 supernova explosions .",
    "the amount of non ",

    "if the stellar cluster was only 3.54.0  myr old when the cavity started to expand , its required mass to drive the estimated amount of mechanical luminosity is 3.8@xmath610@xmath43  m@xmath1 , for a salpeter imf in the 1 100  m@xmath1 range .",
    "this is about a factor 45 lower than the masses estimated by @xcite and inferred from the 2200     luminosity of @xcite , after rescaling for the different adopted distances for ngc4214 .",
    "however , our mass estimate is a _",
    "minimum requirement _ for producing the observed non ",

    "ionized gas taking the form of extended shells with more or less filamentary structure is a common feature of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "such shells are generally around 10  myr old or younger , with very few cases laying in the range 1020  myr @xcite .    in the case of ngc3077 and ngc4214 ,",
    "the convex edges of the shells are well traced by non ",
    "photoionization in our images ( figures  [ fig1][fig2 ] , panel  e ) . for ngc5253 ,",
    "our results are less clear ( figure  [ fig4 ] , panel  e ) , but they provide a picture similar to that of the other two galaxies , once combined with the results of @xcite .",
    "indeed , the inner size of the non  photoionized shell we measure in ngc5253 coincides with the scale at which @xcite find disturbed velocity structure in the galaxy . in all cases",
    ", the shells could be outward starburst  driven shocks ( see discussion in section  6.1 , and @xcite ) , if the starbursts have been lasting for more than @xmath03050  myr .",
    "interestingly , in all three cases the inner edge of the shell is located at a radius of @xmath00.2  kpc from the center of the starburst .",
    "another common feature among the three dwarfs is the fact that the high - surface - brightness regions of the h@xmath5 filaments are generally photoionized , in agreement with previous findings @xcite , while non ",
    "photoionized gas is preferentially located at the inner or outer edges of the filaments .",
    "this is especially evident in ngc3077 ( figure  [ fig1 ] , panel  e ) .",
    "the data thus suggest that the optical emission from shocks , which is relatively faint , dominates when the gas material is moving into low density surroundings , but becomes a small fraction of the total emission when the shock encounters regions of higher gas density , as here the gas emitting from the photodissociation / photoionization edge is likely to dominate .",
    "if this is true in general , the only shock emission detected is the one located in low density regions , and is therefore a lower limit to the total shock emission .    both in ngc3077 and ngc5253 , the inner size of the shells of non  photoionization",
    "exceeds by @xmath040% the near  uv half - light radius of the stellar population as measured directly from our reddening  corrected data ( tables  [ tbl-4][tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "residual dust obscuration in the uv images will have the effect of yielding measured near ",
    "uv half  light radii that are larger that the actual ones , if the dust is centrally concentrated . to quantify this effect",
    ", we use the estimates on the uv dust attenuation given in section  6.1 . if , for both galaxies , we locate the ` missing ' uv flux within the measured half ",
    "light radii , these would be reduced to @xmath084  pc for ngc3077 and to @xmath0110  pc for ngc5253 .",
    "thus , under these assumptions , the uv half  light radii become comparable to or smaller than the h@xmath5 half  light radii , suggesting either that the ionizing population dominates in the near  uv or that the non  ionizing uv population is no more extended than the ionizing one .",
    "whatever the explanation , the starbursts are centrally concentrated and are driving non  photoionization fronts located at a minimum distance of roughly twice the extent of the starburst itself , and a maximum ( detected ) distance of @xmath015 times and @xmath010 times the half  light radius of the starburst , for ngc5253 and ngc3077 , respectively @xcite .    in ngc4214 , both the h@xmath5 and the u  band half  light radii are larger than the shell s inner size , which is at variance with what observed in the other two dwarfs .",
    "although contamination of the u  band half  light radius by the underlying galaxy population can not be excluded , the h@xmath5 half  light radius is not affected by the same problem , excluding measurement biases as the culprit for the larger values .",
    "indeed , the central starburst in this galaxy is intrinsically far more extended than in the other two dwarfs , by about a factor of 2 , as it comprises two distinct and large hii complexes .",
    "conversely , the sizes of the shells are very similar to each other in all three dwarfs .",
    "an additional difference between ngc4214 and the other two dwarfs is in the ` strenght ' of the central star formation , in the sense that ngc4214 is a less intense starburst per unit area than the other two ( table  [ tbl-4 ] , column  7 ) .",
    "the star formation rate per unit area is 0.74  m@xmath1  kpc@xmath47 in ngc4214 , a factor of about 5 and 17 lower than ngc3077 ( 3.7  m@xmath1  kpc@xmath47 ) and ngc5253 ( 12.5  m@xmath1  kpc@xmath47 ) , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the sfr per unit area in ngc5236 is 22.4  m@xmath1  kpc@xmath47 .",
    "the main source of ` dilution ' for the ngc4214 starburst is not the overall sfr , which is similar to the other galaxies ( table  [ tbl-4 ] , column  4 ) , but rather its more extended nature .    in ngc4214 , our detected non ",
    "photoionization shell surrounds only one of the two hii complexes , the northern one ( figure  [ fig2 ] , panel  e ) .",
    "this is similar to what found by @xcite , although with a smaller size than our detected inner edge .",
    "if the center of ngc4214 had contained only one hii complex , the northern one , the starburst / shell geometries in all three dwarfs would have been almost indistinguishable .",
    "this fact , together with the roughly constant value of l@xmath53/l@xmath52 , seems to suggest that external factors , such as being an isolated or interacting galaxy , have little or no influence on the gas ionization characteristics on the scales we are considering .      in ngc5236 ,",
    "the two cavities , a and b , of non  photoionized gas may be evolved regions within the starburst .",
    "region  b , in particular , is surrounded by young ( @xmath6310  myr , figure  [ fig12 ] ) clusters , as identified and age  dated by @xcite . as suggested by these authors , the starburst ringlet in ngc5236 , where region  b is located , may be experiencing an inside - out propagation , with the the youngest stellar clusters , younger than 45  myr , located further out in the periphery of the central starburst than the 5 - 7  myr old clusters .",
    "the propagation hypothesis is further strengthened by the consideration that region  b is more centrally located within the starburst ringlet than the young clusters , and likely marks an earlier site of star formation .",
    "the presence of non  photoionized gas in a localized region removed from the main starburst and its young star cluster component ( region  c , figure  [ fig12 ] ) may be related to the dynamical conditions of that region , rather than to the starburst itself .",

    "studies of the young stellar population component in ngc5253 and ngc3077 suggest that star formation has been an on - going process for at least 100300  myr in the centers of these galaxies @xcite , thus fullfilling the requirement of long star formation durations to provide the mechanical energy necessary to support the observed non ",

    "bright , diffuse population shows an age spread up to @xmath0100200  myr @xcite , although the uv  detected stellar clusters tend to be younger than @xmath020  myr @xcite .",
    "stars and clusters younger than @xmath010  myr are concentrated in an area of @xmath0120  pc diameter around the h@xmath5 peak in ngc5253 .",
    "the shell surrounding the starburst has a dynamical age between @xmath04  myr ( the closest edge to the starburst ) and 25  myr ( farthest edge ) , implying that the starburst has been injecting mechanical energy into the surrounding ism for at least that long .    in the starburst of ngc3077 , the uv  bright stellar clusters span the age range @xmath01300  myr , with clusters younger than @xmath010  myr preferentially located in an area of @xmath0150  pc diameter north of and adjacent to the co complexes @xcite .",
    "ngc3077 appears to display similar age ",
    "concentration characteristics as ngc5253 , with the full uv  bright population occupying a region of @xmath0470  pc in size .",
    "however , neither here nor in the case of ngc5253 , can we discriminate whether the two galaxies are experiencing outside  in star formation , or the older populations have had time to disperse on larger scales than the younger ones .",
    "the co complexes in ngc3077 are presumably the reservoir where the most recent and the future star formation is / will be taking place @xcite .",
    "as already remarked in the previous section , the shells of non  photoionization surrounding the starburst in ngc3077 have dynamical ages in the range 210  myr @xcite , and therefore fit confortably within the age span of the starburst as inferred from the stellar clusters .",
    "the relation between the young stellar populations and the non  photoionization regions is more difficult to infer for ngc4214 , for which the only detailed studies pertain to the most recent star formation episode ( younger than @xmath05  myr , @xcite ) .",
    "the shell detected in our images ( figure  [ fig2 ] , panel  e ) has dynamical age @xmath03  myr , and other shells reach ages of @xmath010  myr @xcite .",
    "the multiwavelength study of @xcite indicates that the on - going star formation event started less than 100  myr ago , but possibly more than @xmath020  myr ago .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , the shell of non  photoionized gas we detect is surrounding only the northern hii complex , while we find no evidence for a similar structure around the southern complex .",
    "this supports independent inferences that the southern hii complex is younger than the northern one : @xcite find that the oxygen aboundance in southern complex is about 0.1 dex higher than in the northen one ; @xcite establish from measurements of h@xmath4 equivelent widths that the southern complex is about 0.5  myr younger than the northern one , and may have not yet experienced supernova explosions ; @xcite find , from recent x  ray observations , evidence for an extended hot gas component only in coincindence of the northern hii complex , with the sourthen hii complex missing such component .",
    "overall , we find evidence that a significant fraction , at least 70% to 100% ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl-5 ] , column  3 , and table  [ tbl-6 ] , column  4 ) , of the mechanical energy from starbursts is deposited into the ism , presumably in the form of relatively large  scale motions , over scales of @xmath02001,000  pc .",
    "this provides a quantification of the feedback mechanism from stellar winds and supernova explosions into the galaxy s ism .",
    "such feedback effects have the potential to influence future star formation in the center of the galaxies , via self  regulation and triggering / propagation @xcite .",
    "as importantly , the triggering / propagation of star formation as a result of feedback @xcite may explain the long star  forming timescales in the centers of ngc5253 and ngc3077 .",
    "such timescale are observed to be in the range @xmath9100 - 300  myr , much longer than the expected duration of a single starburst event ( a few tens of myr , roughly the lifetime of massive stars ) .",
    "the direct triggering of the starbursts , the interaction with the nearby galaxy(ies ) , happened a few hundred myr in the past and is not obviously active at present times .",
    "such long timescales for star formation can be accounted for if the mechanical energy we observe being deposited by massive star winds and supernova explosions is effective at triggering subsequent generations of stars in the inhomogeneous ism of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "high  angular resolution imaging from hst has allowed us to investigate the ionization nature of the gas on small to intermediate  scales ( @xmath0101000  pc ) of four nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * non  photoionization processes are present in all four of the investigated galaxies .",
    "although presence of non  photoionized gas was already known for the three dwarfs , our images have excluded presence of small  scale non  photoionized gas in two of them , ngc3077 and ngc5253 , and have revealed for the first time the presence of localized non  photoionized gas in ngc5236 . * in all cases , the projected , non  photoionized h@xmath5 represents 3%4% of the total h@xmath5 detected in the images , but covers up to 25% of the h@xmath5 emission by area in our data . both numbers , the fraction of non  photoionized / photoionized gas by flux and the areal coverage fraction , should be regarded to some extent as a lower limits .",
    "for instance , the fraction by flux increases by a factor of a few in the metal  rich galaxies of our sample , if a less conservative approach to separating photoionized from non  photoionized gas is adopted . for the areal coverage fraction ,",
    "significantly larger numbers could be found by larger field observations .",
    "neverthless , diagnostics of distant galaxies employing nebular emission lines ( e.g. , to estimate the star formation rates ) are unlikely to be significantly affected by the presence of non  photoionization processes , even in the case of starbursts , as such processes have a small impact on the integrated flux .",
    "* the current starburst can energetically sustain the observed level of non ",
    "photoionized h@xmath5 , bringing support to the suggestion that shocks and their precursors from massive star winds and supernova explosions are the likely ionizing mechanism .",
    "* in the case of the dwarf galaxies , comparison with models show that the energy balance argument works only if the current level of star formation has been subtained for at least @xmath030  myr .",
    "studies of stellar populations confirm this to be the case in all three galaxies .",
    "the basic implication is that there is strong feedback of the starburst into the ism , as the former is observed depositing between 70% and 100% of its mechanical energy into the latter over scales of a few hundred pc . *",
    "no such requirement is needed for the giant spiral , where an ongoing starburst triggered @xmath010  myr ago can still provide enough energy input to account for the observed level of non  photoionization .",
    "* in all four cases , regions of non  photoionzation and co regions do not coincide spatially .",
    "this is further support to the idea that molecular regions host the youngest or future star formation , which has not experienced supernova explosions yet .",
    "* in the three dwarfs non ",
    "photoionization is located mainly in large  scale shells , while in ngc5236 it is located in small  scale cavities surrounded by recent star formation .",
    "the cavities may mark sites of earlier star formation within the current starburst .",
    "no large  scale ( @xmath0200 - 300  pc ) non  photoionization has been identified in the large spiral .",
    "thus , star formation remains a local event , confined by the deep potential well of this massive galaxy .",
    "* the shell / starburst geometries , the shell morphologies , and the non ",
    "photoionized / photoionized gas flux ratios are similar among the three dwarf galaxies , suggesting that external factors , such as being isolated or interacting galaxies , have negligible influence on the gas ionization conditions on the @xmath0few@xmath6100  pc scale considered .",
    "* in the images of ngc4214 a candidate supernova remnant , removed from the main sites of recent star formation , has been located .",
    "this candidate snr is distinct from the snr identified by @xcite .",
    "this work has been supported by the nasa ltsa grant nag59173 and by the nasa hst grant go9144 .",
    "thanks nino panagia for stimulating discussions on line emission characteristics in photoioned regions and in supernova remnants , and fabian walter for providing his co images of ngc3077 .",
