    "since the experimental discovery of graphene,@xcite the honeycomb lattice has been the subject of intense research.@xcite graphene displays unique properties in an external magnetic field , with a non - equidistant landau level structure and a zeroth landau level energy which is independent of the magnetic field strength.@xcite the landau level structure is reflected in the half - integer quantum hall effect observed in graphene,@xcite which , due to graphene s large cyclotron gap , has been observed at room temperature.@xcite these and other remarkable features of graphene emerge quite naturally from a low - energy , continuum description of graphene , the so - called dirac approximation , which is based on a linearization of a nearest - neighbor ( nn ) tight - binding ( tb ) model near the high - symmetry @xmath0-points.@xcite    while many properties of graphene are correctly described by the dirac model , it nevertheless fails in certain respects .",
    "a simple example is found in the optical response displaying a clear saddle point resonance around 4.4 ev that is absent in a linearized model.@xcite more subtle effects such as an orbital magnetic susceptibility away from the dirac point have been identified as consequences of lattice effects lost in a continuum approach.@xcite here , we demonstrate that under certain circumstances the hall conductivity , which is routinely applied as an important tool to characterize graphene experimentally,@xcite can not be accurately described by the dirac model .",
    "specifically , the perfect electron - hole symmetry of the dirac model , present also in the non - linearized nn tb model , results in an optical hall conductivity which is identically zero unless electron - hole symmetry is broken by moving the chemical potential away from the dirac point energy.@xcite in the present work , we predict that going beyond the dirac model by including next - nearest neighbor coupling in a full tb model yields an appreciable optical hall response even when the chemical potential coincides with the dirac point .",
    "this result is demonstrated using a novel perturbative technique that allows us to evaluate the magneto - optical response in an atomistic model for arbitrarily small field strengths .",
    "thus , we identify a significant lattice effect , for which the dirac model predicts a null result .",
    "we note that , interestingly , this deviation occurs for energies well within the range of the linearized band structure of graphene .",
    "it is thus not a result of simply probing the band structure beyond the validity of the linearized model , as is the saddle point resonance mentioned above , but is rather a strong signature of broken electron - hole symmetry .    to go beyond the dirac model",
    ", we return to the tight - binding model from which the dirac approximation emerges .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field can then be included via a peierls substitution .",
    "the trouble with this method is that the periodicity of the peierls phase , for realistic magnetic field strengths , is usually orders of magnitude larger than the lattice constant .",
    "thus , calculations must be made on magnetic unit cells hundreds or thousands of times larger than the wigner  seitz cell . in the case of bulk materials , where the unit cell consists of just a few atoms , this problem may be overcome for large , but reasonably realistic magnitudes of the magnetic field .",
    "however , for nanostructured graphene materials , where the wigner  seitz cell may itself contain hundreds of atoms , direct diagonalization of the resulting hamiltonian is not feasible .",
    "several numerical methods have previously been suggested to overcome this problem.@xcite however , all these methods eventually fail at sufficiently small magnetic fields , because of the divergence of the size of the magnetic unit cell .    in this paper , we present a perturbative approach to calculating the optical hall conductivity in tb models on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the approach requires diagonalization only of the hamiltonian in _ absence _ of the magnetic field , and thus circumvents the problem associated with the periodicity of the peierls phase .",
    "we apply the formalism first to ordinary and gapped graphene , illustrating clear and qualitative deviations from a dirac approximation , as discussed above . finally , to illustrate the power of the perturbative formalism , we apply the method to an example of nanostructured graphene , in this case graphene antidot lattices,@xcite and once again find qualitative differences in the optical hall conductivity compared to a simple continuum treatment .",
    "the derivation of the main result of the perturbative treatment is given in full details in ref .  .",
    "the approach is based on the strategy developed in refs .   and .",
    "the starting point is a tb approximation of the honeycomb lattice without magnetic field .",
    "the optical conductivity is then evaluated using the kubo formalism , with the effect of the magnetic field included perturbatively via a peierls substitution .",

    "before turning to the full tb model , we wish to apply the above approach to demonstrate that , indeed , the hall conductivity in the linearized model vanishes if electron - hole symmetry remains unbroken .",
