    "eigenvalue equations are ubiquitous in science , as they play an essential role in quantum mechanics @xcite , statistical mechanics @xcite , biology @xcite , graph theory @xcite , computer science @xcite , pure mathematics @xcite and more @xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "one evaluates the eigenvalues as an intermediate step towards computing a function @xmath1 of the input matrix @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , the standard procedure to compute matrix functions is to diagonalize the input matrix @xmath3 by finding its right eigenvectors @xmath4 and its eigenvalues @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 is the matrix that has @xmath4 as columns and @xmath7 is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal , one can write @xmath8 the most significant shortcoming of this approach is that conventional techniques for computing the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix of size @xmath9 have a computational cost that scales with the cube of the size of the matrix , which makes them very inefficient when used on large matrices  @xcite .    in many applications , however ,",
    "one is dealing with very sparse matrices , and needs to compute just a small subset of the elements of @xmath10 .",
    "in these cases , one should consider whether it is possible to obtain algorithms with a more favorable scaling .",
    "a typical example can be found in the field of electronic structure calculations , where the interaction potential between the particles can be obtained by evaluating the density matrix @xmath11  that at finite temperature is just the fermi function of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath12  and then computing @xmath13 .",
    "the efficiency of this kind of calculations for large systems can be improved greatly if one can evaluate @xmath11 while avoiding the diagonalization of the hamiltonian , using instead methods with a cost that scales linearly with the size of the system .",
    "many different linearly scaling algorithms have been suggested @xcite , but they are still not used routinely , in part because of their complexity and their memory requirements , and in part because they only become advantageous for very large system sizes . in this paper we introduce a method based on colored - noise , generalized langevin equation ( gle ) thermostats @xcite , that can be used to compute selected elements of the function of a symmetric , positive - definite sparse matrix with linear - scaling effort .    our approach is a generalization of the ideas underlying the so - called @xmath14-thermostat @xcite . by considering the input matrix as the hessian of an @xmath9-dimensional harmonic oscillator",
    ", one can generate an artificial , non - canonical gle dynamics that selectively enforces different occupations onto the various normal modes .",
    "the key idea behind the @xmath1-thermostat is that the gle thermostat can be tailored to generate an arbitrary frequency dependence of the fluctuations of position and momentum , and that with an appropriate choice of such dependence one can obtain the elements of a function of the input matrix as averages of the dynamical variables .",
    "we will start by describing the details of the methodology , and then present its application to different symmetric matrices and real functions , that will be used to discuss the advantages of the method , the statistic and systematic errors , and demonstrate the linear scaling of its computational cost for large , sparse matrices .",
    "a non - markovian stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , based on the langevin equation , for a particle with mass - scaled position @xmath15 and mass - scaled momentum @xmath16 , moving under the influence of a potential @xmath17 can be written as @xcite : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a memory kernel describing the friction , and @xmath20 is a noisy - force term characterized by gaussian statistics and time correlation function @xmath21 . treating analytically and integrating numerically the sde in this form is inconvenient . generating a sequence of random numbers with the prescribed correlation is possible but not straightforward  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , storing and referring to the past momenta in order to introduce the friction memory kernel is inefficient from the point of view of memory requirements and computation time .",
    "however , eq . ( [ eq : nonmarkovian ] ) can be represented @xcite by a markovian , langevin equation in an extended momentum space containing a certain number of additional momenta @xmath22 .",
    "one can then write @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a vector of @xmath25 uncorrelated gaussian random numbers satisfying @xmath26 and @xmath27 . by integrating out the additional fictitious degrees of freedom ,",
    "the non - markovian langevin equation   is recovered describing the trajectory of the physical degrees of freedom @xmath28 , with memory kernels that correspond to a fairly general superimposition of complex exponentials @xcite . in this markovian form",
    ", the dynamics is determined by the drift and diffusion matrices @xmath29 respectively .",
    "it is often more convenient to characterize the dynamics in terms of the free - particle static covariance @xmath30 , i.e. the matrix that contains the stationary correlations between @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the absence of an external potential .",
    "@xmath33 is related to @xmath34 and @xmath35 through @xmath36 and can be used to express a number of physical constraints on the dynamics and to derive a relatively straightforward integrator for eqs .  ,",
    "based on a modified velocity - verlet algorithm  @xcite .",
    "what makes the formalism of eq .",
    "particularly useful is that the sampling and dynamical properties of the gle trajectory can be predicted analytically in the case of a harmonic potential @xmath37 .",
    "this made it possible to obtain within the same formalism a number of useful effects , ranging from efficient canonical sampling  @xcite to the stabilization of multiple time step dynamics  @xcite and the modeling of nuclear quantum effects  @xcite .    within this framework",
    ", one can obtain generalized langevin dynamics that do not fulfill the classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem , and therefore do not sample the canonical ensemble at a given temperature . in the harmonic limit , this stochastic dynamics can be understood in terms of a steady - state process in which normal modes of different frequencies reach a stationary distribution in which position and momentum have gaussian statistics , with frequency - dependent fluctuations . manipulating",
    "the behavior of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the basic idea behind the `` quantum thermostat''@xcite , the @xmath14-thermostat  @xcite , and the method we introduce in this paper .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1-thermostat can be viewed as a generalization of the @xmath14-thermostat , which uses non - canonical sampling to thermalize at a higher effective temperature only the characteristic frequencies of the system that lie in a prescribed , narrow frequency range .",
    "the other frequencies equilibrate at a much lower effective temperature .",
    "this is done by enforcing a delta - like frequency dependence of the fluctuations through a gle based thermostat , and can be used to estimate the density of states of a positive - definite matrix  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the present method is that by a careful choice of the frequency dependence of the fluctuations one can directly evaluate the elements of @xmath10 .    to see how this can be achieved ,",
    "let us consider a symmetric , positive - definite matrix , @xmath3 of size @xmath9 .",
    "this matrix can be used as the hessian of a multi - dimensional harmonic potential : @xmath40 one could then study the dynamics of a particle with unit mass subject to this harmonic potential .",
    "the resulting problem is best studied in terms of normal mode coordinates : if the @xmath41-th eigenvalue of @xmath2 is @xmath42 , and the associated eigenvector @xmath43 , one can write the displacement along the normal mode as @xmath44 and the corresponding momentum as @xmath45 .",
    "if the dynamics is microcanonical , this normal mode will oscillate indefinitely with a frequency @xmath46 . if instead the system is coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath47  for instance by using a langevin equation  the fluctuations of displacement and momentum are bound to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 , taking for simplicity @xmath50 .",
    "now let us consider a gle thermostat whose parameters have been fitted in such a way that , over the range of frequencies that corresponds to the spectral range of @xmath2 , a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath51 will have momentum fluctuations @xmath52 , where we introduced the effective temperature @xmath53 as a shorthand for the average momentum fluctuations .",
    "let us assume that the gle parameters have been chosen so that the momentum fluctuations are related to the desired matrix function @xmath1 as @xmath54 .",
    "if we then apply an independent thermostat of this kind to each of the @xmath9 `` cartesian '' degrees of freedom of the artificial dynamics generated by the potential  , each normal mode will respond as if the gles were applied in the normal modes representation .",
    "this is a consequence of the invariance of the combined gle dynamics with respect to a unitary transformation of the coordinates , which in turn is guaranteed by the gaussian nature of the noisy force and by the linear nature of the stochastic differential equations  @xcite .",
    "the individual normal modes described by the eigenvalues of @xmath2 will then respond to the gle dynamics and reach a steady state with fluctuations that are consistent with the thermostat specifications ; namely @xmath55 . since the eigenvectors @xmath56 form an orthonormal basis and @xmath57 , one can write @xmath58 in particular , @xmath59 can be obtained very easily from the kinetic energy of the gle - thermostatted harmonic dynamics : @xmath60 .    provided that @xmath2 is sparse , the technique described above can be applied with an effort that scales linearly with the size of the matrix , because computing the forces which correspond to the potential   involves a matrix - vector product that can be evaluated in @xmath61 .",
    "averages that correspond to individual elements of the momentum covariance matrix can be evaluated with an effort independent of the size of @xmath2 , so the method remains linear scaling as long as one needs to compute a @xmath61 subset of the elements of @xmath10 . as we will discuss later , the relative statistical error on the results is also independent of @xmath9 .",
    "the procedure we have highlighted here allows to obtain elements of @xmath10 for large , sparse , positive - definite matrices without performing explicitly an eigenvalue decomposition , since both the energy   and the momentum covariance   can be computed in the `` cartesian '' representation . in a similar way one can also obtain traces of the form @xmath62 , which often appear when computing observables in electronic structure calculations and when evaluating thermal averages . in fact ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath63 .",
    "while the idea behind this approach is relatively simple , it is also true that designing a thermostat that enforces the desired @xmath39 dependence is not trivial @xcite .",
    "many conflicting goals must be fulfilled besides the prescribed @xmath51-dependent momentum fluctuations , e.g. the stability of the dynamics and the efficiency of the sampling .",
    "the fitting strategy we use is based on that described in refs .",
    "@xcite , but we found advantageous to start with a simplified parametrization of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 matrices that corresponds to a combination of @xmath14-like memory kernels  @xcite .",
    "the resulting matrices can then be fine - tuned using the more general parametrization described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice ,",
    "obtaining an effective set of parameters requires some experience and a few hours of work .",
    "however , as discussed in previous publications , once a pair of @xmath35 and @xmath33 matrices has been obtained for a given application , it is possible to re - use them in many similar circumstances , by modifying the range of frequencies they work on just by scaling their value .    in the case of the @xmath1-thermostat , scaling the gle parameters",
    "can also be used to extend the range of functions that can be computed .",
    "in fact , for the artificial dynamics to yield a well - defined stationary distribution @xmath2 must be positive - definite , and @xmath1 must be positive - valued , so that the method is restricted to the evaluation of @xmath66 . shifting and scaling @xmath35 , @xmath33 and @xmath2 can be used to change the spectral range of the input matrix to make it positive - definite , while still obtaining the desired matrix function .",
    "let us consider the scaling of the matrices in eq .",
    "( [ cpeq ] ) and ( [ cpeq2 ] ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the transformation of @xmath2 into @xmath69  where @xmath70 is the @xmath71 identity matrix .",
    "if @xmath2 has eigenvalues within the range @xmath72 $ ] , then one can obtain a transformed matrix with range @xmath73 $ ] by choosing @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in the most general case , when all the transformations are applied simultaneously , the @xmath1-thermostat procedure would yield @xmath76 . depending on the function",
    "@xmath1 it might still be possible to perform the inverse transformation and recover the original target .",
    "for instance , if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 , and if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 ,    let us stress from the start that this does not aim to be a very accurate method . a first source of error is the fact that the fit will not in general be capable of enforcing perfectly the desired behavior for @xmath81 .",
    "more flexibility in the fit  and a tighter compliance to the desired constraints  can be achieved to an extent by increasing the number @xmath82 of additional degrees of freedom , at the cost however of larger memory and computational requirements .",
    "typically , we find that a choice between @xmath83 and @xmath84 additional momenta @xmath22 provides sufficient flexibility to obtain a maximum relative error of one percent or less over a range of frequencies spanning several orders of magnitude .",
    "other errors can originate from the parameters of the simulation and can be in principle be made arbitrarily small .",
    "for instance , finite time - step errors can be minimized by choosing small enough time steps ; when using a velocity verlet integrator  @xcite , one could also perform the fit for a specific integration time - step , modifying the target fluctuations vs. frequency curve in such a way that finite time - step errors are accounted for and exactly corrected .",
    "the most serious limitation of this method , however lies in its stochastic nature .",
    "the elements of @xmath10 are obtained from an average of dynamical variables , and the average will be affected by a statistical error .",
    "this component of the error decreases slowly with simulation time , specifically with the square root of the number of uncorrelated samples .",
    "the method we propose here is best suited for the ( many ) applications in which a non - negligible stochastic error can be tolerated and , perhaps , even useful  @xcite , or to initialize other approaches that converge faster but require an initial guess for @xmath10 .",
    "as discussed , the @xmath1-thermostat relies on the accuracy of the fit of the frequency - dependent fluctuations to the desired target ; however the quality of the results as well as the performance of the methodology depend also on other constraints that we will discuss here briefly . in summary ,",
    "a successful set of colored - noise parameters should guarantee : ( 1 ) a tight agreement between @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; ( 2 ) stability of the dynamics with respect to the integration time step ; ( 3 ) statistical efficiency .",
    "the first requirement is rather obvious since the discrepancy in the fit of @xmath85 will cause systematic errors in the evaluated matrix function .",
    "it is not hard to obtain small relative errors over a large range of frequencies for slowly - varying functions .",
    "however , the frequency - dependence of @xmath85 for simple forms of the gle matrices have typically an algebraic @xmath87 decay for high values of @xmath51 .",
    "this is particularly problematic when one wants to obtain an exponentially - decaying @xmath85 . in many applications",
    "it is sufficient that the small @xmath88 are negligible with respect to the larger ones .",
    "therefore , when fitting exponential tails , we have decided to choose a small threshold @xmath14 , and just require that for large @xmath51 the effective temperature of normal modes is smaller than @xmath89 $ ]  rather than it matches the exponential decay .",
    "the second requirement has an impact on the efficiency of the simulation .",
    "the time discretization @xmath90 of the dynamics in the absence of noise is determined by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath91 . however ,",
    "if the noise contains strong components with @xmath92 , it may become necessary to reduce the time step further , in order to integrate properly the stochastic dynamics and obtain the fluctuations that are predicted analytically for an infinitesimal time step . in practice",
    ", this constraint corresponds to making sure that the fourier transform of the memory kernels @xmath93 and @xmath94 do not exhibit prominent features for @xmath92 , and that @xmath95 .",
    "these requirements can be implemented by including additional penalty terms in the fitness function , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the third requirement determines how quickly the stochastic dynamics generates uncorrelated samples of positions and momenta , and is therefore essential to speed up the convergence of averages with time .",
    "since the method requires the calculation of @xmath96 , it is important to minimize the correlation time of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , over the range of frequencies that is relevant for the problem at hand .",
    "if @xmath99 is the total simulation time , the statistical error on the value of @xmath100 for a normal mode of frequency @xmath51 will be of the order of @xmath101  so minimizing @xmath98 allows one to obtain smaller statistical uncertainty for a given length of the simulation .",
    "a small autocorrelation time is also necessary to make sure that the final result will be independent on the initial conditions of the dynamics  which could in principle introduce a systematic bias in the estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "a remarkable feature of the fth method is the very low memory consumption .",
    "if @xmath2 is sparse , the memory footprint grows linearly with the size of the matrix : the storage required consists of roughly @xmath102 real numbers .",
    "the first term is required for the storage of matrix @xmath2 in sparse format  corresponding to the number @xmath103 of non - zero entries ; the second term is the memory required for the modified verlet algorithm , where @xmath9 is the size of @xmath2 and @xmath104 is the number of additional momenta , and the last term is the storage required to collect and block - average an arbitrary number @xmath105 of elements of @xmath10 that one wishes to compute .",
    "the memory required by the fth method in the case of a dense matrix is also relatively small and grows quadratically with the size of @xmath2 : one would need @xmath106 elements to store @xmath2 , another @xmath107 for the block - averaging of the entire @xmath10 and a linear - scaling @xmath108 for the propagation of the gle dynamics .",

    "this naturally defines the distance of two elements of the matrix , @xmath151 , @xmath152 as the distance in periodic boundary conditions of the corresponding sites on the lattice ; from this distance one can then determine any @xmath41-th neighbor of a lattice site .",
    "the random matrices have been obtained in a two step process ; consider a @xmath153 square matrix : first , the diagonal elements @xmath154,@xmath155, ... ,@xmath156 , have been determined with a uniform random number between @xmath157 and @xmath158 for each diagonal element .",
    "then , each off - diagonal element is determined in the lower triangular part of the matrix ; the eigenvalues interval is controlled with the gerschgorin circle theorem in the following way : if the element @xmath148 is @xmath159 , then it will contribute to the gerschgorin radii @xmath160 and @xmath161 of both the @xmath162 and @xmath163 row due to the symmetry of the matrix ; more precisely , adding an off - diagonal element @xmath159 at position @xmath148 will increase both @xmath160 and @xmath161 by a positive quantity @xmath164 . fixing a row @xmath162 ,",
    "each element @xmath165 is a random number uniformly distributed between @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 $ ] ; the division by @xmath169 ensures an almost complete filling of the matrix elements .",
    "this procedure guarantees that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix lie in the interval @xmath170 .",
