    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy contains a wealth of information regarding its star formation history , dust content , and chemical abundance pattern .",
    "these properties provide essential clues to the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of galaxies from high redshift to the present .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to have a robust method for extracting the physical properties of galaxies from their seds .",
    "the process of translating observed seds into physical properties is , unfortunately , very challenging because it requires 1 ) an accurate understanding of all phases of stellar evolution , 2 ) well  calibrated stellar spectral libraries for converting stellar evolution calculations into measurable fluxes , 3 ) an initial mass function ( imf ) , specifying the weight given to each stellar mass , 4 ) detailed knowledge of the star  dust geometry in conjunction with an appropriate extinction curve ; i.e. , knowledge of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "thankfully , there exists a wide array of data capable of constraining sps models . by far the most common type of object used for comparison",
    "is the star cluster . the approximately uniform age and metallicity of the stars within star clusters and the lack of internal reddening ( except perhaps for very young clusters ) affords direct comparison between them and the most basic ingredients in sps  the stellar evolution calculations and stellar spectral libraries .",
    "comparisons to star clusters are either made in cmd space or in an integrated sense ( i.e. , the light from all the cluster stars are added together ) .",
    "the former technique provides a sensitive probe of the main  sequence including the turn - off point , sub  giant and red giant branches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the latter technique provides a more robust measure of the rarer brightest stars that dominate the integrated light from the cluster .",
    "it is the latter method of comparison that is more relevant if the goal of sps modeling is to understand the integrated light from galaxies .",
    "for this reason , the integrated colors , surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) , and spectra of star clusters have been used extensively to compare and calibrate sps models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "there are two significant sources of concern when attempting to calibrate sps models with star cluster data .",
    "the first concern is that the brightest stars , which dominate the integrated light , are rare , and thus stochastic effects must be carefully modeled .",
    "recently , this issue has been addressed observationally by stacking clusters in bins of age in order to synthesize ` superclusters ' that are relatively unaffected by stochastic effects @xcite .",
    "the second concern is less tractable , even in principle , and arises from the fact that the primary sources of star clusters for which ages and metallicities can be reliably estimated are the milky way ( mw ) , m31 , and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) .",
    "this fact imposes severe restrictions on the region of the age  metallicity parameter space that can be constrained with star cluster data .",
    "for example , one of the most important regions of this parameter space for studying galaxies  old and metal rich  contains very few star clusters ( except in the bulge of the mw , although high extinction diminishes the utility of star clusters there ) . in local group star clusters , a bin in age contains clusters of a relatively narrow range in metallicity owing to the simple fact that the metallicity of galaxies tends to increase with age .    because of these issues , entire galaxies are often also used to assess the accuracy of sps models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies are not subject to the two concerns mentioned above , but using them to constrain sps models can be very difficult because 1 ) galaxies contain stars of a range of ages and metallicities ; and 2 ) starlight in galaxies is attenuated by interstellar dust .",
    "nevertheless , if subsamples of galaxies are carefully constructed with known and regular properties , then galaxies can be used to assess the reliability of sps models .",
    "the present work seeks to provide a comprehensive comparison between sps models and observed star clusters and galaxies .",
    "such a comparison is timely because of an abundance of new , high  quality data , including near  ir photometry and sbfs of star clusters in the lmc and smc , uv photometry of clusters in m31 and m87 , cmds and integrated spectra of clusters in the mw , and optical and near  ir photometry and spectral indices for large samples of low  redshift galaxies .",

    "* bc03 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "such a detailed comparison between these popular models has not been undertaken until now , and will thus provide a much  needed evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of these models .",
    "in addition , the flexible nature of our own model will be exploited to explore the extent to which various uncertain phases of stellar evolution , including thermally  pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars ( tp  agb ) , blue hb stars , and post  agb stars , can be constrained by the data .",
    "this task is critical if we are to have confidence in the derived physical properties of galaxies , such as stellar masses and star formation rates .",

    "this section describes in detail the sources and treatment of data both for star clusters ( @xmath6[s : scd ] ) and galaxies ( @xmath6[s : gal ] ) .",
    "the calibration of sps models against data is essential because of the many uncertain model ingredients , including late stages of stellar evolution and stellar spectral libraries .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the star cluster is the ideal observational datum for sps calibration because it is , at least approximately , a coeval set of stars at a single metallicity . in order to provide comprehensive constraints on sps models",
    ", one would like to have data on star clusters spanning a wide range in age , metallicity , and wavelength .",
    "unfortunately , owing to the details of the chemical history of the mw and its satellites , the assembly of such a dataset from nearby galaxies , including our own , is challenging .    in the present work attention",
    "is focused on data from the milky way ( mw ) , m31 , and the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "the first two galaxies are sources primarily of old , metal  poor clusters , while the mcs provide clusters spanning a wider range of ages and metallicities .    before describing the datasets in detail ,",

    "these authors construct a ` test sample ' of star clusters where high quality data are available to estimate main sequence turn - off ages from cmds and metallicities from either the cmds or individual stellar spectroscopy .",
    "these high  quality data are then binned by age to produce average colors and metallicities as a function of cluster age .    in the youngest age bin",
    "a less direct method is used for determining cluster ages in the @xcite sample .",

    "calibration is substantially different from the commonly used relation of @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that since ages are based on cmd fitting , they will depend on the stellar evolution calculations used to convert main sequence turn  off points into ages . in particular",
    ", the treatment of convective overshooting has a strong impact on the age main sequence turn - off point relation for young and intermediate ages ( @xmath21 yrs ) .",
    "this sensitivity arises because overshooting increases the amount of fuel available for core hydrogen burning .",
    "we will return to these issues when these data are compared to models .",
    "the second significant source of data on mc star clusters comes from @xcite .",
    "these authors analyze 2mass data to produce not only integrated near - ir colors but also surface brightness fluctuations in the 2mass @xmath13 filters .",
    "clusters are stacked according to the classification system devised by ( * ? ? ?",

    "this sample has been augmented with @xmath22 colors @xcite , where @xmath23 magnitudes are from the denis survey @xcite and @xmath24 magnitudes are taken from @xcite .",
    "we point out that the pessev et al . and gonzalez et al .",
    "samples are not disjoint .",
    "comparison of these two catalogs will provide a valuable cross  check on the reliability of the data .",
    "the novel feature of these two datasets is that the cluster data have been stacked in bins of age in order to reduce stochastic effects .",
    "a number of authors have discussed the importance of stochastic effects arising from small numbers of very bright stars @xcite . both @xcite and @xcite provide limits on the minimum cluster mass that should be satisfied so that stochastic fluctuations in integrated colors are minimized .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the masses of their stacked clusters easily satisfy both constraints , ensuring that their stacked results can be robustly compared to sps models .",
    "the masses of the stacked clusters in the @xcite sample are comparable to those in @xcite , and so their results should also be relatively unaffected by stochastic effects .",
    "finally , we include for completeness the @xmath2 and @xmath1 colors of lmc clusters from @xcite , which have been used in many comparisons between observations and sps models .",
    "these @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes are converted from the california institute of technology ( cit ) photometric system to the 2mass system using the transformations provided by @xcite .",
    "ages for these clusters were assigned based on the @xmath18-parameter calibration of @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed comparison between their near - ir colors and those of @xcite , in some cases noting substantial differences in the sense that colors from persson et al .",
    "were redder than the colors from pessev et al .",
    "they attributed this difference to the fact that persson et al .",
    "centered their photometry on the brightest part of the cluster in order to maximize the measured flux , while pessev et al .",
    "center their apertures using a gaussian smoothing technique . in some cases",
    "the persson et al .",
    "centroids are significantly offset from the true dynamical center of the cluster because of off  center ir ",
    "bright sources within the cluster .",
    "for this reason , in addition to the fact that the data are stacked to reduce stochastic effects , the results of pessev et al . should be preferred to the older results of persson et al .",
    "we will return to this issue in @xmath6[s : calib ] .",
    "for the reasons mentioned in the previous section , star clusters are the ideal observational data to calibrate sps models .",
    "there are however at least two reasons why it is useful to also consider sps constraints from galaxies : 1 ) galaxies tend to be of higher metallicity than old star clusters , and so sps model predictions for old @xmath27 populations can be assessed with galaxies composed of old stars ; 2 ) galaxies contain many more stars than star clusters , and so stochastic effects are never a source of concern when comparing models to galaxy data .",
    "these two benefits of using galaxies to calibrate sps models are exploited herein by considering two classes of galaxies .",
    "the first class consists of bright red sequence , ` quiescent ' galaxies , which contain old metal  rich stars , and will therefore be useful for calibrating old metal ",
    "rich sps model predictions . the second class are called ` k+a ' , or ` post  starburst ' galaxies , as their spectra are dominated by a mixture of a and k type stars and show no signs of ongoing star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such galaxies are presumed to have had their star formation abruptly truncated .",
    "the presence of a stars in their spectra indicates that the galaxy contains a significant population of @xmath28 gyr old stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". these galaxies will provide valuable constraints on the importance of tp  agb stars , as the prominence of this stellar phase peaks for ages @xmath29 gyr @xcite .",
    "since stars spend a small amount of time in this phase , observational constraints from star clusters can be difficult to interpret because of stochastic variations . as mentioned above ,",
    "a stacking technique is employed when comparing to star clusters so that stochastic effects are minimized .",
    "nonetheless , it will be useful to derive independent constraints from galaxies where stochastic effects are known to be negligible .    as mentioned in the introduction , the use of galaxies to assess the accuracy of sps models is complicated by at least two effects : the attenuation of starlight by dust and the fact that galaxies contain stars of a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "these complications are addressed where relevant in @xmath6[s : calib ] .",
    "the source of all galaxy positions , optical photometry , and redshifts is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as made available through the hybrid nyu value added galaxy catalog ( vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss photometry is k  corrected and corrected for galactic extinction via the ` kcorrect v4.1.4 ` software package @xcite .",

    "the pipeline processing and science archive are described in irwin et al ( 2009 , in prep ) and @xcite .",

    "ukidss photometry is matched to the sdss with a search radius of 5  .",
    "petrosian magnitudes are used for the ukidss photometry .",
    "we do not consider colors that are combinations of sdss and ukidss photometry , so it is not essential that the photometric apertures be precisely matched .",
    "the ukidss survey goes much deeper than 2mass , and is therefore more desirable .",
    "for example , typical 2mass photometric errors for galaxies at @xmath32 are 0.2 mags , compared to @xmath33 for ukidss photometry .",
    "galactic extinction is corrected using @xmath12 reddening estimates @xcite in conjunction with a @xcite extinction curve .",
    "corrections for the ukidss photometry are estimated from the ` kcorrect v4.1.4 ` software package using the 2mass @xmath13 filters since those , and not ukidss filters , are available in the code .",
    "the filter transmission curves for 2mass and ukidss are very similar and so this approximation is justified .",
    "three galaxy samples are considered .",
    "the first are k+a galaxies as identified by @xcite .",

    "these classes are conceptually different in that the former appeals to a modification of the bulk metal ",
    "rich old population while the latter appeals to additions of minority populations .",
    "we consider both of these classes below .",
    "we find that the discrepancies are unlikely to be due to the stellar spectral libraries .",

    "these results are at odds with @xcite who showed that the optical spectra and @xmath130 colors of ssps at @xmath149 are markedly different when comparing models constructed using the basel spectral library and the empirical @xcite library .",
    "the purported discrepancies caused by the spectral libraries can not be reproduced with our fsps code when using the empirical miles library . to test that this was not due to differences between the miles and pickles library",
    ", we also compared spectra generated from the bc03 model using both the basel and pickles library and again find no substantial difference in @xmath130 colors .",
    "we have also compared the spectra of individual stars from the pickles , miles , and basel libraries for the same stellar parameters discussed by maraston et al . and again can not reproduce their results ( i.e. , their figure 4 ) .",
    "we also point out that in the context of the explanation proposed by maraston et al . , the basel library should provide a better fit to the data when the colors are k  corrected to @xmath150 ( as opposed to @xmath30 ) , because their discrepancy arises in a region of the spectrum sampled by the @xmath151band redshifted to @xmath30 . however , when we compare the colors of @xmath152 red sequence galaxies we find that the model discrepancies remain .",
    "the discrepancy is also unlikely to be due to unresolved issues with canonical phases of stellar evolution such as the main sequence and rgb , because the aspects of stellar evolution relevant for @xmath3 colors are adequately described by the models for old , metal  rich star clusters .",
    "this claim is based on two observations .",
    "first , from figure [ fig : hz ] it is clear that fsps can reproduce the main sequence turn  off point and base of the rgb of old , metal  rich star clusters .",
    "this is especially the case for @xmath94 colors of the clusters ngc 6791 and ngc 188 . to the extent that there are residual discrepancies , the models tend to be somewhat too blue compared to the data , which is in the opposite sense of the discrepancies noted for galaxies .",
    "second , in figure [ fig : cmdf ] it was shown that for blue colors such as @xmath20 , one need not probe the brightest portions of the rgb in order to achieve convergence in the integrated color ( the results for @xmath130 are very similar to @xmath20 ) . therefore , integrated @xmath130 colors of old metal ",
    "rich clusters should be accurate because the main sequence turn  off and the base of the rgb are relatively well  fit by the model in the cmd .    in sum , we believe that the discrepancies between model and data @xmath3 colors and spectral indices are not a reflection of the limitations of either stellar atmospheres or canonical aspects of stellar evolution .",
    "there are two remaining possible solutions to the disagreement between models and data for massive red sequence galaxies , which we lump into one class because they share the common property of being minority additions to the dominant , old metal ",
    "rich population .",
    "the first solution consists of modifications to the ssps .",
    "this solution includes the addition of bs or blue hb stars .",
    "the second solution to these disagreements lies not in trying to fix the ssps but rather in relaxing the implicit assumption that these massive red galaxies are composed of mono  metallic , coeval stars .",
    "indeed , estimates of the metallicities of stars in our own and nearby galaxies , either from direct spectroscopy or via the colors of giant branch stars , always yield a metallicity distribution function that is approximately lognormal with a full width of @xmath153 dex @xcite .",
    "models for the chemical evolution of galaxies also generically predict that galaxies should contain stars of a range of metallicities , including a non  trivial fraction of metal  poor stars @xcite .",
    "extreme / blue hbs exist in the solar and super  solar metallicity star clusters ngc 188 @xcite and ngc 6791 @xcite , in addition to moderately sub  solar clusters @xcite .",
    "resolved uv photometry in the nucleus of m32 has shown that @xmath154% of hb stars are hot @xcite . moreover ,",
    "many metal ",
    "rich clusters contain copious bs populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations suggest that it would be prudent to consider models that allow for blue / extended hbs and bs stars to be associated with metal  rich populations . in our treatment",
    "we are agnostic as to which population ( metal  rich or metal  poor ) these hot stars are associated with .",
    "these various effects are explored in figures [ fig : lick3 ] and [ fig : grcol ] . in these figures",
    "we explore the impact of various modifications to the base dust  free ssp models .",
    "modifications include : 1 ) a small fraction ( @xmath155% ) of young ( @xmath156 gyr ) stars ; 2 ) a population of blue hb stars ( @xmath157 ) ; 3 ) a population of bs stars ( @xmath116 ) ; 4 ) a minority population ( 5% ) of metal  poor stars .",
    "all of these modifications move the base ssp models in the correct qualitative sense ; that is they result in lower values of d@xmath4 and larger h@xmath5 strengths , and bluer @xmath3 colors .",
    "these trends result from the fact that each modification is adding a population of relatively hot stars , whether in the form of a hotter main sequence turnoff ( as happens when metal  poor stars are added ) , hot evolved stars including bs and blue hb stars , or hot young stars .",
    "hotter stars have lower values of d@xmath4 , larger balmer absorption , and bluer continua .",

    "our contribution to this issue has been twofold : 1 ) to highlight the connection between the indices and broadband @xmath3 colors , in the sense that whatever hot star population is adopted , it should alleviate the discrepancies seen in both indices and colors ; 2 ) to remind the user of sps models that reliable results concerning the ages and metallicities of massive ellipticals can not be attained unless these minority hot star populations are carefully considered .",
    "many previous studies have considered one or more of the minority populations considered herein as a remedy to the model discrepancies .",
    "@xcite disfavors appeals to blue hb stars based on the consideration of higher  order balmer lines in ellipticals .",
    "however , this conclusion rests on the assumption that the temperature distribution along the hb in other galaxies is similar to that seen in the mw . while this may seem to be a relatively benign assumption , recent uv observations of clusters in m87 cast doubt on this @xcite .",
    "if the m87 result holds up to further scrutiny , it will mean that insights from the mw star cluster population can not be readily applied to other galaxies .",
    "this would be a dramatic setback to our attempts at understanding the stellar populations in other galaxies , and would have potentially profound implications for our understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "the addition of metal  poor stars is rarely considered without also considering the addition of blue hb stars . in this work",
    "we have separated these two populations , since the observed relation between metallicity and hb morphology in the mw is complex and displays considerable scatter @xcite .",
    "it should be remembered that in every galaxy where metallicity distribution functions have been measured , there exist metal  poor stars ( log@xmath158 ) in sufficient numbers ( @xmath159% ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to effect the integrated blue / uv flux .",
    "given this observational fact , metal  poor stars _ must _ be included in the models ; the only question that remains is in what proportion .",
    "it is something of a disappointment that the identification of the hot star population in ellipticals remains unresolved more than three decades after it was first discussed . despite enormous advances in both the sps models and the quality of the data",
    ", the fundamental problem remains that these various hot star populations occupy essentially the same ( or similar ) ranges in @xmath50 .",
    "we briefly comment on several possible future directions that might help separate the relative influence of these various populations .",
    "if young stars or metal  poor stars are the dominant contributor , then because their metallicities will differ from the bulk population , metallicities measured in the blue / uv will differ from metallicities measured in the red .",
    "models will have to be constructed to determine whether or not this effect is measurable .",
    "if it is then this could be a promising means of discriminating between the various hot star candidates .",
    "if young stars are the culprit , then lookback studies of ellipticals will uncover ellipticals with younger and younger minority populations .",
    "such a study would suffer from the typical difficulties in lookback studies , namely that precise descendant ",
    "progenitor relations are difficult to construct . however , with new and upcoming wide ",
    "field spectroscopic surveys we believe that the difficulties associated with lookback studies can be mitigated .",
    "lookback studies might also be able isolate the importance of blue hb stars @xcite .    a final , somewhat more speculative possibility , is the use of sbfs in the blue to discriminate between these various populations .",
    "while these populations occupy approximately the same range of @xmath62 , they all occupy rather different ranges in @xmath49 , and they will thus produce different sbf magnitudes in the blue .",
    "we are currently constructing models aimed at determining whether or not such an effect is observable with current facilities .",
    "k+a , or post  starburst , galaxies offer a unique constraint on intermediate age populations .",
    "the prominent a star spectra in these galaxies without any accompanying h@xmath102 emission ( i.e. , no _ current _ star formation ) , indicates that they are dominated by stars with ages @xmath160 gyr .",

    "the bc03 model predictions are somewhat too blue in @xmath167 , although we believe that the agreement is acceptable given the fact that post  starburst galaxies are composite populations whereas we have modeled them as single populations ( see below ) .",
    "in contrast to the fsps and bc03 models , the m05 model performs poorly in @xmath130 and @xmath167 colors .",
    "in particular , model sequences of increasing age produce trends in these colors that are orthogonal to the observed trends with age . in the context of the m05 model the increasing @xmath130 and @xmath167 colors",
    "would be interpreted as a sequence of either increasing dust content or increasing metallicity .",
    "this interpretation would be in contrast with the observed variation in the spectral properties .",

    "for example , as shown in figure [ fig : kacol ] , the dust reddening vector lies parallel to the locus of data , and so dust effects can not move the models onto or off of the observed locus , but only along the locus . since our conclusions do not rely on the detailed location of the models along the observed locus , our results are insensitive to dust effects .",
    "we have also considered the effects of adding an old population on top of the intermediate age , post  starburst population . even in the extreme case where 90% of the mass is contained in an old population and",
    "only 10% spans the intermediate age range of @xmath161 gyr , the red end of the model predictions only shift slightly toward redder colors .",
    "the primary effect of an addition of an old population is a narrowing of the range in color of the model predictions . in any event",
    ", the addition of old stars has an effect similar to dust attenuation  namely , the models shift along the observed locus . we conclude that , in the case of post  starburst galaxies and for the colors we have considered , composite population effects do not impact our conclusions .",
    "in the previous section we explored the constraints on several sps models provided by star cluster data in the local group and m87 and by post  starburst and massive red sequence galaxies .",
    "we now summarize these results and provide a general evaluation of the models .",
    "star clusters in the mcs provide valuable constraints on models at intermediate age and sub  solar metallicities .",
    "the m05 model performs poorly when compared to the extant data , while the bc03 model performs better , although the bc03 model is somewhat too blue in the near  ir . in m05 , the colors are too red and the age ",
    "dependence is incorrect .",
    "the incorrect age  dependence in m05 can not be attributed to the details of mc cluster age estimation .",
    "our own fsps model with padova isochrones is able to achieve excellent agreement with the data only after we modify the tp ",
    "agb phase of the input padova isochrones .",
    "the basti isochrones in fsps fare well , although less ",
    "so in the near  ir , which plausibly reflects their simplistic tp  agb treatment , and , at young ages , which may be due to our use of the basti isochrones that suppresses convective overshooting .",
    "similar conclusions are reached regarding the fsps model when considering constraints afforded by sbfs of mc star clusters .",
    "the mw and m31 provide a large sample of old , metal  poor star clusters , but only a small handful of old metal  rich clusters .",
    "the fsps ( using both the padova and basti isochrones ) , bc03 , and m05 models all make similar predictions for the @xmath170 photometry of old metal  poor systems .",
    "the models compare favorably in @xmath11 colors once uncertainties in the filter transmission curves are considered .    in the near  ir the models perform less well , where for example @xmath2 colors are too blue by @xmath171 mags at log@xmath93 .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is unclear , but may either be due to an rgb that is too hot ( lowering the rgb by 200k would alleviate this tension ) or stellar libraries that are inadequate in the near  ir . at higher",
    "metallicity , multi  color cmds in @xmath172 colors are well reproduced by the fsps model in regards to the location of the turn  off point , sub  giant branch , and the lower portion of the rgb .",
    "we demonstrate that agreement in cmd  space between data and models does not imply that the integrated colors are adequately constrained because the integrated colors in the red and near  ir are dominated by the brightest stars in the cluster .",
    "these stars are rarely included in cmd studies because they are rare and often saturate the photometry . in any event , even if these stars are considered , owing to their rarity it is challenging to reliably calibrate models in this regime in cmd  space .",
    "it is for this reason that we focus our calibrations on integrated cluster properties , rather than resolved cmds .",
    "the spectral indices d@xmath4 and h@xmath5 of mw star clusters are not adequately reproduced by either the fsps or bc03 model at high and low metallicities , respectively ( the m05 model does not contain sufficient spectral resolution to make a robust prediction ) .",
    "these inadequacies are removed if bs or hot hb stars are added .    in the ultraviolet ,",
    "the fsps model can reproduce the observed trends because the relevant phases  post  agb and hb  are handled flexibly and so can be tuned to match the data . the bc03 and m05 models generally fare less well , either because of the omission of blue hb stars ( bc03 ) or post  agb stars ( m05 ) .    turning to galaxies ,",
    "all models predict @xmath3 colors of red sequence galaxies that are too red and the fsps and bc03 models predict d@xmath4 strengths that are too strong ( again , the m05 model does not contain the requisite resolution ) , under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old stars with @xmath173 .",
    "these issues are likely closely connected to the model failures at reproducing the spectral features of metal  rich mw star clusters .",
    "these discrepancies can be removed by adding a minority population of hot stars , coming either from metal  poor turn  off stars , hot hb stars , bs stars , or young ( @xmath97 gyr ) stars .",
    "the fsps and bc03 models are able to reproduce the optical and near  ir colors of post  starburst galaxies , while the m05 model performs less well .",
    "these galaxies likely have a preponderance of tp  agb stars , and so they provide valuable constraints on this phase .    in summary ,",
    "our fsps model is able to reproduce the greatest range of observations , due in large part to the flexibility of the model .",
    "bc03 fares somewhat less well , and m05 performs worst of the three . even where calibrating data is available , significant discrepancies remain .",
    "important regions of parameter space do not contain sufficient calibrating data , and so the models are even less reliable there . finally , when modeling predominantly old , metal  rich populations , care must be taken to include minority populations of hot stars .      in this section",
    "we comment on a number of other sps models in the literature .",
    "the main purpose of the following discussion is to highlight the fact that many sps models rely on the same ingredients as the models considered in detail herein , and therefore conclusions reached in earlier sections should be applicable to other models as well .",
    "the most popular sps models not considered herein are starburst99 @xcite and pegase @xcite . in its most current version",
    ", starburst99 combines the geneva models for massive stars and the padova isochrones for intermediate and low mass stars .",
    "starburst99 employs the tp  agb models of @xcite , which are the same models used in bc03 .",
    "the basel stellar library is used to convert the models into observable seds . for hot stars ,",
    "the theoretical models of @xcite are used .    for stellar populations",
    "not dominated by massive stars , starburst99 will produce results similar to bc03 .",
    "the treatment of nebular emission and massive stars , including wolf  rayet stars , is more sophisticated than either fsps , m05 , or bc03 , and should therefore continue to be the model of choice when emission from massive stars is important .",
    "the recent popstar model @xcite also contains a sophisticated treatment of massive stars , including the theoretical atmosphere models for o and wolf  rayet stars of @xcite , and will therefore produce results similar to starburst99 .",
    "pegase utilizes the padova isochrones and couples these to two different stellar spectral libraries : basel , and elodie @xcite .",
    "elodie is an empirical library of @xmath174 stars . in @xcite ,",
    "various spectral indices are computed with pegase and compared to observations .",
    "the comparisons focus on a small sample of indices ( including h@xmath175 , fe5270 , mgb , and fe5335 ) for elliptical galaxies and mw star clusters",
    ". it would be fruitful to consider more comprehensive calibrating comparisons for the pegase model , such as is considered herein . in any event",
    ", the underlying isochrones are similar to those used in bc03 , so the predictions of pegase should be similar to bc03 .    the vazdekis models are described in @xcite , @xcite , and vazdekis et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "they utilize the padova isochrones coupled to the empirical miles stellar library . for old populations this model should thus be essentially identical to the fsps predictions when the unmodified padova isochrones are used .",
    "the vazdekis model may thus fail to reproduce the observed near ",
    "ir colors of mc star clusters , since , as we demonstrated , the unmodified padova isochrones are a poor match to those data .",
    "significant efforts are currently underway to generate sps models that handle @xmath47enhancement self ",
    "consistently , in the sense that both the stellar evolution calculations and the atmosphere models have the same abundance patterns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". these models will provide valuable constraints on the relative effects of @xmath47enhancement .",
    "however , most models currently only follow stellar evolution through the end of the rgb , and so they can not be used on their own to build model galaxies ( the exception to this is the basti database ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we anticipate that the treatment of @xmath47enhancement as a variable on par with age and @xmath57 in sps models will likely become commonplace in the near future .    from the above discussion",
    "it should be clear that the majority of sps codes use the padova isochrones with the basel stellar library .",
    "our comparisons and evaluations in previous sections , which rely on these ingredients , should therefore be applicable to many other sps models .",
    "we now summarize our principle results .    * the latest stellar models from the padova group can not fit the near  ir photometry and surface brightness fluctuations of star clusters in the mcs . with our flexible sps ( fsps )",
    "code we have modified the tp ",
    "agb phase in the padova isochrones to produce better fits to the data .",
    "the m05 models also fail to reproduce the data , both because the colors are too red and the age ",
    "dependence is incorrect .",
    "the bc03 and the fsps model using the basti isochrones fare well , although both models are somewhat too blue in the near  ir .",
    "a significant limiting factor in more accurate calibrations is the difficulty in constructing reliable photometry of mc clusters , owing to the fact that tp ",
    "agb stars are luminous and rare . * at low metallicities ( log@xmath176 ) and old ages , all models predict similar @xmath170 colors ( the typical variation between models is @xmath177 mags ) .",
    "when compared to mw and m31 star clusters , the models are 0.2 mags too blue in @xmath2 at log@xmath93 , and 0.1 mags too red in @xmath1 at all @xmath57 .",
    "the origin of the discrepancies in the near  ir is unclear .",
    "decreasing the temperature of the rgb by @xmath178k alleviates much of the disagreement .",
    "if this modification is isolated to the brightest stars , then such a modification could improve agreement with integrated photometry without compromising agreement in cmd  space .",
    "the fsps model with the basti isochrones performs worst at low metallicities and old ages of the models considered ( although the disagreement is not dramatic ) , while the fsps model with the padova isochrones performs well .",
    "+ multi  color cmds of two metal  rich clusters ,",
    "ngc 6791 and ngc 188 , are well  fit by fsps .",
    "spectral indices of mw star clusters are generally well  fit by both fsps and bc03 , although the models predict d@xmath4 strengths too large and h@xmath5 strengths too weak compared to two log@xmath179 clusters .",
    "* the ultraviolet photometry of the mw , m87 , and m31 star clusters can be well  fit by fsps because fsps contains flexible treatments of the post  agb and horizontal branch evolutionary phases .",
    "this flexibility is essential given the substantial scatter in the ultraviolet data at fixed metallicity , and given our inadequate theoretical understanding of these phases .",
    "the m05 and bc03 models perform less well because of their incomplete treatment of these advanced evolutionary phases . *",
    "sps models are compared to @xmath180 photometry of massive red sequence galaxies .",
    "the fsps , bc03 , and m05 models fare well in most respects , with a few exceptions : all models are too blue in @xmath132 ; the m05 model is somewhat too blue in @xmath134 ; all models are far too red in @xmath130 and @xmath135 .",
    "these conclusions hold under the assumption that red sequence galaxies are composed exclusively of old metal  rich stars with canonical evolutionary phases .",
    "the disagreement in the @xmath3 colors can be alleviated if some combination of young ( @xmath97 gyr ) stars , metal  poor stars , and blue straggler stars are added in small amounts .",
    "* optical spectral indices of massive galaxies are generally well  fit by the fsps and bc03 models , with the important exceptions that both models predict d@xmath4 in excess of observations and neither fit the observed locus of galaxies in the d@xmath181h@xmath5 plane .",
    "these conclusions hold for the same assumptions noted above , and , as above , small additions of some combination of young stars , metal  poor stars , blue straggler and horizontal branch stars can remedy this disagreement . *",
    "the fsps and bc03 models adequately describe the @xmath182 colors of k+a , or ` post  starburst ' galaxies , while the m05 model performs less well .",
    "such galaxies contain a large proportion of intermediate age ( @xmath183 gyr ) stars and thus provide unique constraints on the importance of tp  agb stars in galaxies .",
