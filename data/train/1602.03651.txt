    "systems with chirality imbalance , namely with a finite chiral density @xmath2 generated by quantum anomalies , have attracted some interest in recent years .",
    "in fact gauge field configurations with a finite winding number , @xmath3 , can change fermions chirality according to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly  @xcite .",
    "for example in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) such nontrivial gauge field configurations with @xmath4 are instantons and sphalerons , the latter being produced copiously at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "in qcd the time evolution of @xmath5 is governed by the equation @xmath6 with @xmath7 corresponding to the field strength tensor and @xmath8 its dual ; the winding number is defined in terms of the field stregth tensor as @xmath9 the term @xmath10 is not invariant under parity transformations , @xmath11 , hence currents generated by quantum anomalies are referred to as @xmath12odd currents .",
    "study of systems with @xmath13 , and in particular of @xmath12odd currents appeared many years ago  @xcite with applications to early universe physics ; nevertheless the possibility to observe @xmath12odd phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions by the celebrated chiral magnetic effect  @xcite ( see   @xcite for reviews ) has boosted the interest for the study of a medium with a net chirality , which spread from qcd to hydrodynamics and condensed matter systems @xcite , and recently has been observed in zirconium pentatelluride  @xcite .    in order to describe systems with finite chirality in thermodynamical equilibrium , it is customary to couple the chiral chemical potential , @xmath0 , to its conjugated quantity namely the chiral density quark operator , @xmath14 , in the same manner one usually couples the quark number density @xmath15 to the conjugated quark chemical potential @xmath16 , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "because of quantum anomaly as well as of chirality changing processes due to finite quark condensate , @xmath0 is not conjugated to a quantity which is strictly conserved ; therefore usually one has to assume the system at finite @xmath0 in thermodynamical equilibrium is observed on a time scale much larger than the typical time scale of the chirality changing processes .    in the context of qcd",
    "an interesting problem is the dependence of the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration , @xmath17 , at @xmath1 .",
    "several calculations based on chiral models predict @xmath17 to be lowered by @xmath0 , the slope of the line @xmath18 and its curvature depending on the specific model used  @xcite . on the other hand recent lattice data",
    "have shown that critical temperature increases with @xmath0   @xcite .",
    "this behavior of @xmath18 was predicted for the first time by universality arguments in  @xcite and it has also been found later by solving schwinger - dyson equations at finite @xmath0  @xcite . therefore it is interesting to understand if and how chiral models can reproduce at least qualitatively the dependence of @xmath17 versus @xmath0 found on the lattice .    as it was discussed several years ago in  @xcite , and then made even more transparent in  @xcite , the behaviour of the critical temperature as a function of @xmath0 in chiral models is related to a competition among the vacuum term and the thermal fluctuations .",
    "in fact although at zero temperature the chiral chemical potential acts as a catalyzer of chiral symmetry breaking , close to the critical temperature thermal fluctuations become more important at @xmath1 , destroying the chiral condensate and leading to a decreasing critical temperature . the final result of",
    "the calculation was that the critical temperature decreases as @xmath0 increases , even if the slope of the critical line is very small compared to that of @xmath17 versus the baryon chemical potential .    in this competition mechanism among vacuum term and thermal excitations ,",
    "the role of the divergent vacuum energy is crucial . in previous calculations",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath19 appears explicitly in @xmath18 , so @xmath20 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to look for a calculation scheme in which the dependence on @xmath19 is removed by renormalization of the vacuum energy .",
    "this is the main goal of the study presented here , in which we focus on the computation of @xmath18 within a quark - meson ( qm ) model with renormalization prescriptions for the vacuum energy at @xmath1 .",
    "we already know that renormalized vacuum energy in chiral models may affect the order of a phase transition  @xcite",
    ".    we will find that among three renormalization schemes ( rss ) considered there exists one , named rs3 in the main part of the text , which predicts the increase of @xmath17 with @xmath0 , in agreement with the most recent lattice data  @xcite .",
    "what we find interesting is that the evolution of @xmath17 with @xmath0 is achieved without the addition of any extra coupling term in the qm lagrangian , and within a simple mean field calculation .",
    "we thus find the result a nice example of how the proper treatment of the divergent vacuum energy in chiral models can affect the computation of physical quantities .",
    "the qualitative agreement of rs3 with lattice data is encouraging so we are tempted to take rs3 as the best rs among the ones studied here ; however we should wait for the results of lattice simulations with masses close to the physical ones before making such a statement , and at the moment the most fair attitude is to consider the results of the present study as an exploration of the possible scenarios that the qm model can predict .    the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review briefly the qm model and the renormalization of the vacuum energy at @xmath1 . in section iii",
    "we extend the renormalization to the case @xmath1 , introducing the three rss . in section",
    "iv we present the main result of our study , namely the critical temperature as a function of @xmath0 , obtained within the three rss . finally in section",
    "v we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review very briefly the quark - meson ( qm ) model  @xcite , focusing in particular on the thermodynamic potential in the mean field approximation and on the renormalization of the vacuum term at @xmath21 .",
    "the qm model is defined by the following lagrangian density @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lagrangian density of meson fields , with @xmath24 representing a scalar field and @xmath25 an isotriplet pseudoscalar field .",
    "the potential @xmath26 which is responsible for spontaneous breaking of the @xmath27 symmetry as well as for classical meson excitations spectrum is given by @xmath28 which is invariant under @xmath27 rotations in the @xmath29 space .",
    "the quark content of the model is specified by the following lagrangian density : @xmath30\\psi + \\mu_5\\bar\\psi\\gamma_0\\gamma_5\\psi,\\ ] ] with @xmath31 being a quark field with dirac , color and flavor indices . in this equation @xmath0",
    "is the chiral chemical potential , and its conjugated quantity is named the chiral charge density , @xmath32 ; for a system of @xmath33 massless fermions one has the simple relation at zero temperature : @xmath34 which is formally equivalent to the relation among quark number density @xmath35 and quark number chemical potential @xmath16 for a system of massless fermions at zero temperature , namely @xmath36 for the case of massive fermions in eq .",
    "it is enough to replace @xmath37 ; on the other hand between @xmath5 and @xmath0 is more complicated and it depends on the way one treats the divergence in the vacuum energy , see the next section .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in the qm model occurs because of breaking of @xmath27 symmetry in the meson sector down to @xmath38 by the condensates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which is transmitted to quarks via the yukawa coupling of the latter with the condensate background @xmath41 .",
    "we assume @xmath42 in eq .   which implies @xmath43 , where @xmath44 corresponds to the pion decay constant in the vacuum .",
    "with this choice the tree level mass spectrum of @xmath24 and @xmath45 mesons is given by @xmath46 the symmetry breaking pattern is thus equivalent to chiral symmetry breaking in qcd due to the chiral condensate , with a massive @xmath24 mode and a triplet of pions behaving as goldstone modes .",
    "the one - loop thermodynamic potential reads then @xmath47 where @xmath26 is the chiral invariant meson potential given by eq .",
    ", @xmath48 corresponds to the vacuum energy , @xmath49 with @xmath50 finally @xmath51 is the thermal contribution to the quark thermodynamic potential , @xmath52 the zero temperature thermodynamic potential eq .",
    "is divergent in the ultraviolet ; often this divergence is treated in an effective way by introducing a certain regularization scheme , let us say an ultraviolet cutoff , and treating the cutoff as an additional parameter of the model , fixed for example by requiring that the masses of pion and sigma mesons computed within the model , as well as the chiral condensate , are in agreement with the measured values of these quantites .",
    "this choice is perfectly reasonable and legittimate , since qm model ( and chiral models more generally ) should be considered , at most , as low energy models for chiral symmetry breaking of qcd ; it is thus natural that a cutoff appears in the calculations and treat this cutoff as a parameter .",
    "however the qm model is renormalizable , thus it is also legittimate to perform a renormalization procedure to manage the ultraviolet divergence of the vacuum energy getting rid of the cutoff introducing and physical renormalization point .    in order to prepare @xmath48 in eq .   for renormalization we formally expand eq .   in powers of @xmath0 ; we obtain @xmath53 with @xmath54 and terms with higher powers of @xmath0 vanish when momentum integration is extended to infinity . to regularize the divergent contributions we follow the strategy of  @xcite and introduce the functions @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are",
    "complex numbers ; the regularized values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 will be obtained by analytical continuation of @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 respectively . in the above equations we have introduced the mass scale @xmath16 which serves to leave the mass dimension of the integrals unchanged at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; @xmath16 will appear only in the arguments of logarithms and acts as an renormalization point only in the intermediate steps of the calculation ( renormalization conditions will help to remove any @xmath66dependence ) . performing momentum integrations and making analytic continuation to @xmath67 , @xmath68",
    "we find the regularized expressions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , namely @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the above equations @xmath72 corresponds to the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath73 is the di - gamma function .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences of the vacuum energy appear as poles in eqs .   and",
    "analogously to what happens within dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "equation   shows that @xmath0 adds a further divergence in the vacuum energy , which needs to be renormalized by a proper renormalization condition which has to be considered as a part of the assumptions of the model .",
    "we now briefly sketch the standard renormalization procedure of the quantum effective potential for the qm model at zero temperature , in the case @xmath21 .",
    "we emphasize here just the few steps which are important for the renormalization at @xmath74 which will be discussed in the following section  [ rmu5 ] .",
    "we add to @xmath48 two counterterms , @xmath75 and impose the renormalization conditions  @xcite @xmath76 which imply the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath24 field is not affected by the one - loop corrections and is determined by the classical potential @xmath77 only .",
    "taking into account eqs .   and",
    "the renormalized potential is thus given by @xmath78 these brief remarks about renormalization at @xmath79 will be useful in the next section where we describe the renormalization procedure at @xmath1 .",
    "here we discuss the renormalization procedure we use for the thermodynamic potential at zero temperature for the case @xmath74 .",
    "the renormalization condition at @xmath79 has to be considered as a part of the assumptions in the model .",
    "the divergence in eq .   is transmitted to physical quantities ; for example assuming that @xmath58 has been already renormalized , for @xmath81 the solution for the @xmath24 condensate can be found analytically as @xmath82 and expanding in powers of @xmath83 . after a straightorward calculation and taking into account eq .",
    "we obtain , to the lowest order in @xmath0 , @xmath84 which shows that renormalization of the vacuum part with conditions in eq .",
    "still leaves a divergent contribution to the gap equation at @xmath1 .",
    "moreover by taking the second derivative of eq .   with respect to the @xmath24 field , which is equivalent to compute the polarization tensor of the @xmath24 meson at zero momentum , it is possible to show that the screening mass of this meson gets a divergent contribution from the quark loop , namely @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the polarization tensor of the @xmath24 meson at zero external momentum .",
    "the use of renormalization is not only a formal caprice : the cutoff in momentum integral removes fermion modes from the vacuum which instead might play some role at finite @xmath0 .",
    "we consider for example the zero temperature chiral condensate , which can be computed easily by taking the trace of the propagator @xmath87 $ ] , with the result @xmath88 where @xmath89 are defined in eq .",
    "and @xmath90 is a numerical constant which is not important for the discussion . in the above equation",
    "we have left an explicit ultraviolet cutoff @xmath19 in the momentum integral .",
    "for @xmath21 the momentum region in which the term in parenthesis takes its largest contribution is @xmath91 ; on the other hand @xmath0 shifts gradually this domain to higher values of @xmath92 , as also noticed in  @xcite , meaning that to manage properly the chiral condensate one has to include higher momenta and this is feasible either introducing an explicit dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath0 , or performing the renormalization of the ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we will consider here three different renormalization schemes : the first one , which we name renormalization scheme 1 ( rs1 in the following ) where we assume the fermion vacuum term does not shift the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath24 field at @xmath74 , in analogy to what we assume in the @xmath21 case ; also the squared mass of the @xmath24 meson is assumed to be the one at @xmath21 .",
    "the rs1 is certainly the cheapest scheme . on the other hand we will consider also less cheap renormalization schemes , named rs2 and rs3 , in which we add a further counterterm at @xmath1 and impose one renormalization condition more with respect to rs1 .",
    "we will show similarities as well as differences in the phsyical content of the several renormalization schemes , then focusing on the effect of the choice of a specific one on the restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature .",
    "we first discuss rs1 . as in the case @xmath21 we add to @xmath48 two counterterms as in eq .   and impose the renormalization conditions in eq .   which imply , among other things , that @xmath93 does not take contributions from @xmath1 at @xmath79 .",
    "the renormalized @xmath59 thus reads @xmath94    the renormalized potential in the eq",
    ".   shows an explicit and finite dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the chiral density @xmath95 is also finite and non - vanishing : at the global minimum of the thermodynamic potential @xmath96 , which is always satisfied at @xmath79 within rs1 , we obtain indeed @xmath97 for completeness we also write down the expression for the susceptibility of the chiral density @xmath98 : @xmath99 equation   shows the increase of @xmath5 with increasing @xmath0 as expected : adding @xmath0 injects chirality in the system ; nevertheless within rs1 there is no effect of such chiral density on the breaking of the @xmath27 spontaneous symmetry breaking because of conditions  .",
    "therefore within rs1 the only effect of injecting chirality at @xmath79 is a finite and condensate dependent shift of the vacuum energy",
    ".      the previous renormalization scheme might be satisfactory from a formal point of view ; it seems however somehow hard to accept physically because we would expect the quark loop at finite @xmath0 in the grand potential to give a contribution to the @xmath24 condensate and/or to the screening mass of the @xmath24 meson , in the same way it gives a contribution at finite temperature .",
    "we therefore are tempted to check what is the effect of tilting the renormalization conditions in order to have a dependence of the @xmath100condensate and/or @xmath24 meson screening mass at finite @xmath0 and @xmath79 .    to this end",
    "we introduce renormalization scheme 2 ( rs2 ) which differs from rs1 because we introduce independent counterterms for the @xmath21 and @xmath1 parts of the vacuum energy .",
    "the idea is as follows : the chiral chemical potential introduces in the vacuum energy only one log - type divergence proportional to @xmath101 , and this suggests the need of one single counterterm to renormalize the divergence .",
    "therefore to the total vacuum energy we add the counterterms @xmath102 instead of eq .  .",
    "the explicit @xmath103 in the above equation is just a matter of convention .",
    "we use @xmath104 in eq .   to renormalize the @xmath21 potential , assuming the renormalization conditions @xmath105 with @xmath106",
    ". conditions   and   are formally identical to the ones used in the previous section to renormalize the vacuum energy at @xmath21 : they are thus enough to remove quadratic and log the divergences appearing in @xmath107 .",
    "we now use the @xmath108counterterm in eq .   to renormalize the divergence in @xmath59 in eq .   .",
    "to this end we assume the renormalization condition @xmath109 the above condition is enough to remove the divergence of @xmath59 : @xmath110 and together with conditions   and   it implies that @xmath96 at @xmath79 : the chiral chemical potential within rs2 does not shift the expectation value of @xmath24 .",
    "however the second derivative of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath24 is finite , therefore the screening mass of the @xmath24 meson gets a finite @xmath0 dependence given by @xmath112 for completeness we compute also the chiral density and its susceptibility within rs2 at zero temperature ; we find @xmath113 and @xmath114    before going ahead we would like to comment that we have checked that instead of @xmath96 in eqs .  ,",
    "and   we can use @xmath115 with any real value of @xmath116 and still the renormalization procedure works .",
    "this opens the possibility to add by hand in rs2 a dependence @xmath117 which is certainly feasible but it should rely on the choice of an ansatz : we prefer to rely not on an ansatz hence we consider in this study only the solution @xmath96 within rs2 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the chiral condensate @xmath118 has a @xmath0 dependence within rs2 as well as rs1 at @xmath79 even if the @xmath24 condensate does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "since we are interested here only to a qualitative behaviour of @xmath119 versus @xmath0 we limit ourself to a phenomenological treatment of the divergence and introduce an ultraviolet cut off @xmath19 in the relevant momentum integrals .",
    "of course this naive procedure does not affect at all the results of this section , and we use it only with the purpose to illustrate qualitatively the behaviour of the chiral condensate at finite @xmath0 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the chiral condensate at @xmath21 , @xmath122 is the solution of the gap equation and @xmath19 is an ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath123 .",
    "we notice that the @xmath0-dependent term in the above equation shows an explicit log - type divergence ; the same kind of divergence appears in full qcd using the lattice regularization  @xcite .",
    "equation   shows that the chiral chemical potential increases the magnitude of the chiral condensate , its correction being negative for @xmath123 .",
    "this is a clear evidence that @xmath0 favours chiral symmetry breaking at @xmath79 .",
    "the catalysis at small temperature with @xmath1 has been found for the first time in  @xcite using an effective model with a coupling to the polyakov loop  @xcite ; then it has also been found in several other model calculations  @xcite ; recently this catalysis at zero temperature has been described very nicely in terms of bcs - like instability of the fermi surface at @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "chiral condensate has been measured recently on the lattice at finite @xmath0 and finite temperature , and it has been found that also at temperatures below the critical temperature @xmath119 increases with @xmath0 for the case of staggered fermions  @xcite , thus supporting the catalysis of chiral simmetry breaking at finite @xmath0 in qualitative agreement with eq .  .",
    "next we turn to renormalization scheme 3 ( rs3 ) which sligthly differs from rs2 because it allows a dependence of the @xmath24 condensate on @xmath0 at @xmath79 .",
    "in fact within rs2 the effect of @xmath0 at zero temperature is a shift of the screening mass of the @xmath24 meson , at the same time assuming @xmath96 for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "once again this choice is certainly satisfactory from a formal point of view , but probably still lacks some physical content because if @xmath0 acts as a catalyzer of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , then we would expect the @xmath24 condensate to increase with @xmath0 .    within rs3",
    "we take counterterms as in rs2 , see eqs .   and   and assume the conditions   and  . on the other hand , instead of condition   which eventually constraints @xmath96 for any @xmath0",
    ", we assume the less severe condition @xmath124 the above equation is equivalent to a minimal subtraction scheme for the polarization tensor of the @xmath24 meson , in which the dressed propagator for this quantum fluctuation at @xmath79 is given by @xmath125 , \\label{eq : boh}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 corresponds to the polarization tensor ; within rs3 whenever in the ground state @xmath96 then the screening mass of the @xmath24 meson does not take contribution from the zero temperature part of the quark loop .",
    "the above conditions are enough to remove the divergence of @xmath59 which in rs3 reads @xmath127 the present renormalization scheme is quite interesting because it permits the computation of the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath24 condensate at @xmath79 , as well as the shift of the screening mass of the @xmath24 meson .",
    "although the previous equations are valid for any value of @xmath128 we limit ourselves to a solution of the gap equation for the @xmath24 condensate for small values of @xmath129 because in this case we obtain simple analytical relations , and more important the role of the vacuum term on the critical temperature will be more transparent .    the @xmath24 condensate in the limit @xmath130 is computed by minimizing @xmath131 with respect to @xmath24 , with @xmath77 and @xmath132 defined in eqs .   and  , assuming the ansatz @xmath133 with @xmath134 and expanding to the lowest non trivial order in @xmath135",
    "the calculation is straightforward and not informative so we limit ourself to quote the final result , namely @xmath136 the above equation shows the @xmath24 condensate increases with increasing @xmath0 as expected .",
    "we can also compute the shift of the screaning mass of the @xmath24 meson by computing the second derivative of @xmath137 with respect to @xmath24 at the global minimum of the potential  .",
    "we find @xmath138 for completeness we report the zero temperature relation among chiral density and chemical potential within rs3 which is easily obtained from eq .  ,",
    "namely @xmath139 we also compute the zero temperature chiral density susceptibility , whose calculation is elementary but requires some care because the condensate within rs3 depends on @xmath0 and this dependence has to be taken into account when the second derivative of the vacuum energy with respect to @xmath0 is performed : @xmath140 .\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for sake of reference in table  [ tab:1 ] we summarize the physical content of the three renormalization schemes discussed above .",
    "we have not specified the values of the positive proportionality constants because the only purpose of the table is to collect the relevant similarities and differences of the three renormalization schemes . before going ahead",
    "we notice that @xmath5 and @xmath141 depend on the renormalization scheme used : this is not surprising because , even if they correspond to physical observables , before renormalization they are divergent and the three rss , which formally correspond to different subtractions in the bare expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath141 , lead to three different models as we have summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "we have found that @xmath18 increases with @xmath0 , in agreement with recent lattice estimates of the same quantity as well as with previous analysis based on universality @xcite and solution of schwinger - dyson equation @xcite .",
    "the reason of the discrepancy among the rss is easy to understand . within the model at hand , as well as other simple chiral models ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath18 is understood as a competition between the vacuum energy on the one hand , and on the thermal part of the thermodynamic potential on the other hand  @xcite .",
    "expanding the thermodynamic potential in power series of @xmath24 in the vicinity of the phase transition , namely @xmath146 with @xmath147 given by equations  , and  , it is clear that the vacuum term at @xmath74 near the phase transition tends to lower the value of @xmath147 , hence pushing the critical temperature towards larger values ; on the other hand the contribution of the thermal fluctuations to @xmath147 is positive , hence these tend to lower the critical temperature .",
    "in previous model calculations it has been always found that eventually the competition is won by the thermal fluctuations because the vacuum term was not strong enough .",
    "we have obtained the same scenario within the rs1 and rs2 . on the other hand within rs3 the vacuum energy",
    "gets an extra negative term from renormalization which makes it strong enough to compete against thermal fluctuations and push @xmath18 towards larger values .",
    "this is clearly represented by eq .",
    "in which @xmath57 depends on the rs used : @xmath68 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 for rs1 , rs2 and rs3 respectively .",
    "we would like to remark that even if @xmath17 represents a physical quantity in principle measurable , in our calculations it depends explicitly on the rs because the three rss introduced here correspond eventually to three different models , in which the ground state at @xmath79 reacts in a different way to @xmath0 .",
    "the qualitative agreement of rs3 with lattice data is encouraging so we are tempted to take rs3 as the best rs among the ones studied here ; however we should wait for the results of lattice simulations with masses close to the physical ones before making such a statement , and at the moment the most fair attitude is to consider the results of the present study as an exploration of the possible scenarios that the qm model can predict .    in conclusion ,",
    "the lesson we have learned from this study is that the vacuum energy in chiral models has to be treated with care ; a similar call for a proper treatment of the vacuum energy was given in  @xcite in which it was shown that the order of the phase transition in a magnetic field can change depending on the way the vacuum energy is renormalized . in the context of strong interactions at finite @xmath0",
    "we have found that predictions about the behaviour of the critical line at finite @xmath0 depend on the way the divergence of the vacuum energy is treated .",
    "moreover we have shown that a simple chiral model like the qm model is capable to reproduce qualitatively the recent lattice data about @xmath18 , within a mean field approximation , and without the addition of any exotic ingredient , once a renormalization scheme is chosen .",
    "the results presented here are thus encouraging and suggest to further investigate properties of strongly interacting matter with chiral chemical potential by the qm model .",
    "finally we would like to mention that a possible future direction for investigation is the study of in - medium properties of the system with finite chirality , using for example the strategies of @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to mention that in chiral models it is often assumed a local interaction which leads to a momentum - indepenent fermion self - energy at tree level , in turn implying the consideration of all momentum modes in the chiral condensate at finite temperature and these might affect the role of the thermal fluctuations on the critical temperature . in our opinion it is urgent to understand the effect of a momentum - dependent quark self - energy on the evolution of the chiral condensate at finite @xmath0 and @xmath170 .",
    "works along these directions are already in progress and we plan to report on these topics in the near future .",

    "<S> in this article we study restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature for quark matter with a chiral chemical potential , @xmath0 , by means of a quark - meson model with vacuum fluctuations included . </S>",
    "<S> vacuum fluctuations give a divergent contribution to the vacuum energy , so the latter has to be renormalized before computing physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum term is important for restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature and @xmath1 , therefore we present several plausible renormalization schemes for the ultraviolet divergences at @xmath1 . then we compute the critical temperature as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of our study is that the choice of a renormalization scheme affects the critical temperature ; among the three renormalization schemes we investigate , there exists one in which the critical temperature increases with @xmath0 , a result which has not been found before by chiral model studies and which is in qualitative agreement with recent lattice data as well as with studies based on schwinger - dyson equations and universality arguments . </S>"
