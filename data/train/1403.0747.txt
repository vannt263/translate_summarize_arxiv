    "<S> the toms - winter conjecture has been verified for various naturally occurring classes of algebras : in particular many @xmath0-algebras of the form @xmath11 arising from minimal homeomorphisms of compact metric spaces satisfy the conjecture . in the uniquely ergodic case elliott and niu have shown that regularity is automatic @xcite ( a fact related to unique ergodicity implying mean dimension zero  regularity can fail for larger trace spaces ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to classification by @xmath2-theory ( see @xcite , and @xcite for the case of @xmath12 actions ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the implications ( i)@xmath13(ii ) and ( ii)@xmath13(iii ) have been established in general by the third named author @xcite ( see @xcite for an extension to the stably projectionless case ) and rrdam @xcite respectively ; recent progress of matui and the first named author @xcite establishes ( iii)@xmath13(ii ) for @xmath0-algebras with a unique tracial state ( this has subsequently been extended to somewhat more general trace simplices in @xcite ) . in the traceless case , ( iii)@xmath13(ii ) boils down to kirchberg s celebrated @xmath14-stability theorem for purely infinite nuclear @xmath5-algebras , @xcite ; ( ii)@xmath13(i ) follows from kirchberg - phillips classification combined with @xcite in the presence of the universal coefficient theorem ( uct ) , and was shown in general in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> classification results provide one route towards the implication ( ii)@xmath13(i ) , via the strategy of comparing an algebra with a directly constructed model which has finite topological dimension . as well as passing through vast amounts of technical machinery , </S>",
    "<S> this approach is inevitably restricted to @xmath0-algebras satisfying the still mysterious uct . </S>",
    "<S> a direct approach was pioneered by tikuisis and the third named author in @xcite ( heavily based on the results of kirchberg and rrdam in @xcite ) , which proves that @xmath4-stable locally homogeneous algebras have finite decomposition rank ( even outside the simple setting ) ; however this too relies in an essential way on the existence of a concrete inductive limit structure . </S>",
    "<S> a recent breakthrough was achieved by matui and the first named author in @xcite , which , in the presence of a unique tracial state , establishes finite decomposition rank from quasdiagonality and @xmath4-stability . </S>",

    "<S> , this confirms the toms - winter conjecture in the form stated above for @xmath0-algebras with a unique tracial state . </S>",
    "<S> thus the difference between finite decomposition rank and finite nuclear dimension for unital , simple , separable and monotracial @xmath4-stable algebras is precisely quasidiagonality , and it remains an open question as to whether such algebras are automatically quasidiagonal . </S>",
    "<S> ( indeed this is a special case of the blackadar - kirchberg conjecture from @xcite , which asks whether every stably finite nuclear @xmath0-algebra is quasidiagonal . )    </S>",
    "<S> conjecture [ ca ] holds under the additional assumption that @xmath3 has at most one tracial trace .    in the rest of the introduction </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the analogies between the regularity properties in conjecture [ ca ] and properties of von neumann factors of type ii@xmath16 and provide an architectural outline of the proof of theorem [ main ] .    </S>",
    "<S> each of the statements in the toms - winter conjecture is a natural analogue of a corresponding property for ii@xmath16 factors : strict comparison relates to the fact that the murray - von neumann lattice of projections in a ii@xmath16 factor is determined by the trace ; tensorial absorption of @xmath4 to being a mcduff factor ( absorbing the hyperfinite ii@xmath16 factor tensorially ) ; and finite nuclear dimension to hyperfiniteness . for ( separably acting ) injective ii@xmath16 factors these properties are theorems ( of course comparison holds for all ii@xmath16 factors ) , and all play roles in carrying through the implication from injectivity to hyperfiniteness in connes celebrated paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> from this viewpoint , carrying through the implications ( iii)@xmath13(ii)@xmath13(i ) in the toms - winter conjecture provides a @xmath0-algebraic version of connes characterisations of injectivity .    in his work </S>",
    "<S> connes relies on a detailed analysis of automorphisms of ii@xmath16 factors , and the notion of an _ approximately inner flip _ </S>",
    "<S> ( the automorphism @xmath17 on the tensor square can be approximated by inner automorphisms ) plays a key role . a crucial step in connes proof that injectivity implies hyperfiniteness is to show that any automorphism of an injective ii@xmath16 factor with separable predual is approximately inner ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * corollary 3.2 , theorem 5.3 ) in the strong topology . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has strongly approximately inner flip ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.1 ( 7)@xmath13(3 ) ) and therefore is mcduff ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.1 ( 3)@xmath13(2 ) ) in a particularly strong fashion ; from this connes obtains hyperfiniteness of @xmath18 ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.1 ( 2)@xmath13(1 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , by now two beautiful alternative proofs without using automorphisms have been obtained by haagerup and by popa , but for our purposes it will be more suitable to focus on the original strategy involving approximately inner flips .    </S>",
    "<S> effros and rosenberg initiated the study of approximately inner flips in the setting of @xmath0-algebras in @xcite . as they observe , an approximately inner flip is a strong requirement on a @xmath0-algebra ( implying simplicity , nuclearity and at most one trace ) , but several prominent examples enjoy such a flip , like uniformly hyperfinite ( uhf ) @xmath0-algebras , the jiang - su algebra @xmath4 and the cuntz algebras @xmath19 and @xmath20 , all of which play key roles in the modern study of nuclear @xmath0-algebras . using the approximately inner flip , </S>",
    "<S> effros and rosenberg characterised the universal uhf algebra @xmath21 as the unique separable unital @xmath0-algebra which is quasidiagonal , has an approximately inner flip and tensorially absorbs @xmath22 ( * ? ? </S>",

    "<S> * theorem 5.1 ( 2)@xmath13(1 ) ) . with the benefit of hindsight , </S>",
    "<S> this result can be thought of as the precursor to the strategy of @xcite and our work here . </S>",
    "<S> effros and rosenberg compare the first factor embedding @xmath23 of @xmath3 into the ultrapower of @xmath24 with an embedding of @xmath3 into @xmath25 obtained from quasidiagonality . </S>",
    "<S> they then conjugate these two embeddings using the approximately inner flip on @xmath3 , and obtain an approximately finite dimensional ( af ) structure on @xmath3 directly from this , whence @xmath3 is isomorphic to @xmath22 by elliott s classification theorem @xcite . from today s perspective , effros and rosenberg s </S>",
    "<S> approach can be used to directly give approximations verifying decomposition rank zero ( equivalent to being af by @xcite ) .    here , it should be noted that there is a significant difference between approximately inner flips in von neumann algebras and @xmath0-algebras . in both contexts </S>",
    "<S> this implies amenability , but there are @xmath2-theoretic obstructions preventing a general simple unital nuclear @xmath0-algebra with unique trace from having an approximately inner flip . </S>",
    "<S> indeed af algebras with an approximately inner flip must be uhf @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a key idea is that of a `` 2-coloured approximately inner flip '' for a @xmath0-algebra ( in the norm sense ) as introduced in @xcite , and this notion applies to a broader class of algebras . starting from connes approximately inner flip on an injective ii@xmath16 factor , </S>",
    "<S> such a 2-coloured approximately inner flip was established for simple separable unital and nuclear @xmath0-algebras with a unique trace which absorb a uhf - algebra tensorially by using a 2-coloured approximate murray - von neumann equivalence , which in turn is inspired by haagerup s approach @xcite to injectivity implies hyperfiniteness . </S>",
    "<S> this ingredient is structured so that the flipping strategy gives the estimate @xmath26 for a quasidiagonal simple separable unital nuclear @xmath0-algebra @xmath3 which is @xmath27-stable ( i.e. @xmath28 ) and has unique trace  the two colours in the decomposition rank estimate arising from those in the approximately inner flip . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate @xmath29 ( i.e.  a @xmath30-coloured approximation ) of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1 ) in the @xmath1-stable case arises from using the uhf - stable approximations twice .    in both @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> @xcite quasidiagonality provides @xmath31-homomorphisms from a quasidiagonal @xmath0-algebra @xmath3 into the ultrapowers @xmath32 of suitable uhf algebras ( analogous to the asymptotic embeddings into the hyperfinite ii@xmath16 factor which arise from condition ( 2 ) in ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 5.1 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> as voiculescu shows in @xcite , the cone over any @xmath0-algebra @xmath3 is quasidiagonal , so nontrivial order zero maps from @xmath3 into these ultrapowers always exist . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to use such maps in place of the @xmath31-homomorphisms used in @xcite . as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an alternative proof of voiculescu s result when @xmath3 is nuclear without elementary quotients , and has a separating family of tracial states . </S>",
    "<S> the argument uses recent work of kirchberg and rrdam on the tracial ideal in an ultrapower @xcite , which also shows that the order zero maps @xmath33 can be taken to preserve a fixed trace on @xmath3 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> lin s work @xcite on af - embeddability of crossed products ) , and are unital modulo the tracial ideal . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the flipping strategy working in an algebra of the form @xmath34 , the presence of a uhf algebra @xmath35 providing the @xmath36-coloured approximately inner flip . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the extra properties of the map @xmath37 to obtain order zero maps @xmath38 such that @xmath39 ( for this we use a uniqueness result for certain positive contractions in @xmath40 proved using recent cuntz - semigroup classification theorems @xcite ) ; thus the resulting factorisation takes values in @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> accordingly , when @xmath3 does have an approximately inner flip , for example when it is strongly self - absorbing , we get an estimate @xmath43 in theorem [ main ] ( see theorem [ approxflipdim1 ] ) .    in section [ regularity - section ] </S>",
