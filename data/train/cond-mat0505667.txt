    "understanding how , and when , materials break are important in many engineering applications .",
    "this is so for a number of reasons ",
    "the motivation to study fracture may , for instance , be related to safety issues , such as determining when cracks form in concrete structures , or it may be one of economical gain , as in the case when the runnability of a printing press in the paper industry is considered .",
    "few materials , be they natural or manufactured , are perfect , however . hence , the disorder in the micro - structure needs to be accounted for in order to obtain a realistic description .    over the past fifteen years methods have emerged within the statistical physics community to successfully tackle just such problems  @xcite .",
    "these methods are intermediate between the microscopic , or first principles , approach and the mean - field type of approach . in the former case fracture properties",
    "are derived from inter - molecular or inter - atomic forces , representing a problem which is both theoretically demanding and heavy on numerical resources . in the latter case disorder",
    "can not be included in a satisfactory way .",
    "this is a big drawback since the presence of disorder in a material is crucial to the way it fractures .",
    "disorder affects the stress field in such a way as to enhance the already existing heterogeneities .",
    "this interplay , between a constantly evolving non - uniform stress field and local variations in material properties , can nevertheless be handled in a numerically tractable way using lattice models .",
    "the most common lattice models used in engineering applications are finite element methods ( fem ) , the implementation of which is usually based on commercially available computer codes .",
    "the lattice models currently used in statistical physics differ somewhat from the fem - approach in that the grid used is regular , i.e. , the same everywhere , rather than one which adjusts the mesh size according to where the stress field is most intense .",
    "although fem modeling is certainly more suitable in describing homogeneous materials , the requirement that the stress field should vary slowly over each element makes the approach cumbersome in the presence of heterogeneities . in the stochastic lattice model , however , the nodes are thought of as being connected by objects such as elastic beams or current carrying elements .",
    "while in some respects being less sophisticated than fem methods , the interpretation of the algorithm is much more transparent and the approach also has the advantage of allowing disorder to be included quite generally .    in the stochastic models , the local equilibrium in force and moment",
    "is considered on a mesoscopic scale , i.e. , on a scale much smaller than the external dimension of the lattice but still sufficiently large for the forces to be governed by well known physical laws . in this sense",
    "it is also a very good alternative to the far more complicated approach of including disorder on the microscopic level .",
    "since only the nearest neighbours on the lattice are included the calculation of the displacement field reduces to the inversion a sparse matrix , enabling reasonably large systems to be handled computationally .",
    "one feature which is of a phenomenological nature , however , is the breaking rule ",
    "the choice here is guided by intuition rather than by the inner workings of the model itself .",
    "in other words , breaking does not arise as a natural consequence of the calculations .",
    "this is actually an advantage in that the mechanism by which the system ruptures can be tailored to suit different engineering requirements .",
    "if we regard thin planar materials , for instance , the energy required to propagate a crack across a given area is usually much lower in mode - iii fracture , i.e. , tearing , than in the pure tensile loading of mode - i fracture .",
    "familiar examples of disordered materials which behave this way are textiles and paper .",
    "most of the research done so far in stochastic lattice modeling aims to identify the underlying general principles of the fracture process rather than to address traditional problems in fracture mechanics . in this paper the plane beam model  @xcite , which has been used previously to study scaling laws in fracture , is extended to include a specific , and practical , aspect of fracture which is very important for thin sheet materials , i.e. , buckling .",
    "as is well known , buckling can profoundly influence the residual strength of such materials  @xcite .",
    "but before devoting our attention to this problem in full , we briefly mention part of the background which has inspired the use of lattice modeling as a tool in statistical physics .    in modeling experiments of random media ,",
    "the feature which by far has received the most attention is the morphology of crack surfaces .",
    "many surfaces in nature are found to be self - affine , i.e. , statistically invariant with respect to anisotropic scale transformations .",
    "the morphology of such surfaces can be described by simple scaling laws , behaving very much like fractal objects  @xcite .",
    "these scaling laws provide a theoretical framework whereby much information can be summed up in a few parameters .",
    "certain features have been found to share a common basis with other , seemingly unrelated , problems such as deposition and growth processes , or transport properties in random media  @xcite . in the case of fracture",
    "it has been established that crack surfaces scale as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the system size , @xmath2 is the roughness and @xmath3 is the roughness exponent .",
    "other scaling laws have been studied , e.g. , in connection with the distribution of stresses , or for the total amount of damage found at various stages in the breakdown process .    by",
    "far the most popular tool in such studies has been the random fuse model  @xcite . in the fuse model ,",
    "the nodes on the lattice are connected by current - carrying elements , i.e. , fuses .",
    "the threshold for the amount of current which may flow through each fuse is chosen from a random distribution . hence , in the breakdown process a fuse is irreversibly removed from the lattice once its threshold is exceeded . a new distribution of currents is then calculated before the next fuse is removed , and so on , until an uninterrupted path can be traced across the system .",
    "although it really describes electrical breakdown , the fuse model is often referred to as a scalar model of fracture due to the similarity in form between ohm s law and hooke s law of linear elasticity .",
    "results obtained for @xmath3 with the fuse model are found to be different in two and three dimensions , however .",
    "the results are @xmath4 in two dimensions  @xcite and @xmath5 in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "although the former seems to agree with experimental findings , the latter does not .",
    "furthermore , the type of forces involved on the meso - scale also seem to make a difference , i.e. , the results obtained with a scalar model differ from those obtained with a vectorial model .",
    "specifically , in calculations with the elastic beam model @xmath6 is obtained in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the results of the two and three dimensional fuse model indicates that the additional degrees of freedom afforded by the ( three - dimensional ) buckling beam model should provide a lower estimate for the roughness exponent in the vectorial problem as well .",
    "since the observed value in real materials , i.e. , @xmath7  @xcite , in fact does lie below the two dimensional beam lattice result , it would be interesting to see if the buckling beam lattice reproduces the universal value observed in nature .",
    "however , although such fundamental aspects of the fracture process are certainly interesting , the subject of how buckling affects the scaling laws are left for future study .",
    "the focus in this paper is instead on the development of a lattice model that realistically includes the buckling behaviour observed in thin sheet materials .",
    "the characteristic out - of - plane deflection known as buckling is perhaps most frequently associated with thin plates or beams under compressive loading .",
    "presently , however , we concern ourselves with the special case of a thin planar structure under tensile loading .",
    "the interaction of buckling with fracture in such circumstances is a well known phenomenon , although it has often been neglected in fracture mechanics analyses due to the extra complications involved .",
    "one of the characteristic features of buckling in a thin tension - loaded sheet is that a stable out - of - plane configuration is obtained after buckling has set in .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the case of compressive loading , where loss of stability usually signals complete breakdown .",
    "practically all previous work considers the effect buckling has on the strength properties of an already cracked plate or a plate with a geometrical discontinuity such as a circular hole or a rectangular cut - out .",
    "if the physical parameters of the plate are such that buckling can be expected before the crack begins to grow , the residual strength of the plate will be significantly lower than what would otherwise be expected , based on an analysis which does not take account of buckling .",
    "the present study of fracture and buckling will be more general in scope .",
    "in other words , we also regard sheets which , in their initial state , have no cracks or other discontinuities .",
    "instead , cracks form by a complex process which depends on the evolving distribution of stresses and its interaction with a disordered meso - structure .",
    "the onset of buckling in this scenario , and the effect buckling has on the fracture properties , will vary according to the type of disorder used , i.e. , weak or strong .",
    "nonetheless , even for weak disorders the final crack which breaks the system will only rarely appear at the exact center of the sheet , and even then the situation will usually be complicated by additional cracks in the vicinity  cracks which interact with the main crack so as to alter the distribution of stresses and hence also the exact shape or mode of buckling .",
    "the emphasis here , however , is on the development of the model itself . for illustration purposes ,",
    "a few results are included on uniform systems with a center - crack . in section  [ planb ] the plane beam model",
    "is briefly reviewed , before the equations describing the out - of - plane behaviour are derived in section  [ bbm ] .",
    "typical stress and displacement fields are shown in sections  [ sdf ] and  [ fff ] , respectively , before the initialization of buckling is discussed in section  [ vrn ] and a fracture criterion defined in section  [ fracrit ] , where results for the buckling response ratio of a center - cracked sheet are included .     where a force couple has been applied uniformly on opposite edges .",
    "the strain imposed is consistent with mode - i type fracture and corresponds to a displacement @xmath8 in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "the enumeration scheme of the neighbouring beams is shown on the right - hand side , where a rotation at node  @xmath10 ( center dot ) induces shearing forces and bending moments in the neighbouring beams .",
    "[ beamlatt ] ]",
    "the beam model may be defined as a regular square lattice of size @xmath11 , where the spacing is one unit length , and each node in the horizontal and vertical in - plane directions is connected to its nearest neighbours by elastic beams .",
    "a beam is then fastened to other beams in such a way that , upon subsequent displacement of neighbouring nodes , the angle between beams remains the same as in the original underlying square lattice , see fig .",
    "[ beamlatt ] .",
    "furthermore , all beams are imagined as having a certain thickness , providing finite shear elasticity .    beginning with the simple two dimensional beam model ,",
    "there are three possible degrees of freedom , i.e. , translations in the horizontal ( @xmath12 ) and vertical ( @xmath13 ) directions , and rotations about the axis perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath14 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ beamlatt ] , this allows for both bending moments and transverse shearing forces , in addition to the axially tensile , or compressive , forces .    for any node @xmath10 ,",

    "expressions for @xmath20 are analogous .",
    "prefactors characteristic of the material and its dimensions are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is young s modulus , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the area of the beam section and its moment of inertia about the centroidal axis , respectively , and @xmath25 the shear modulus  @xcite .",
    "the conjugate gradient method  @xcite is used to obtain the displacement field from @xmath26=\\lambda               \\left[\\begin{array}{l }                        w_{i}\\\\                        x_{i}\\\\                        y_{i}\\\\                     \\end{array }               \\right ] ,                \\label{ma2x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 are the components of force and moment .",
    "the material is assumed to be brittle , i.e. , each beam is linearly elastic up to the breaking threshold .",
    "using @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the thresholds in axial strain and bending moment , respectively , a good breaking criterion , inspired from tresca s formula , is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the largest of the moments at the two beam ends @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "the fracture process is initiated by imposing an external vertical displacement which at the top row corresponds to one beam - length , i.e. , @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ beamlatt ] .",
    "the lattice now consists of horizontally undeformed beams and beams which in the vertical direction are stretched lengthwise .",
    "the first beam to break is that for which the ratio @xmath32 is largest , this being the vertically oriented beam which has the lowest value of @xmath28 .",
    "if all threshold values are the same , the next beam to break will be one of the nearest lateral neighbours since these now carry a larger load than other beams on the lattice .",
    "the case of no disorder is thus one in which the crack propagates horizontally from the initial damage , taking the shortest possible path to break the lattice apart .",
    "introducing disorder in the breaking thresholds , material strength varies across the lattice and consequently the crack will not necessarily develop from the initial damage point .",
    "instead microcracks and voids form wherever the stress concentration most exceeds the local strength , i.e. , wherever eq .",
    "( [ tresca ] ) dictates that the next beam should be broken . towards the end of the breakdown process",
    "smaller cracks merge into a macroscopic crack , forming a sinuous path which ultimately traverses the width of the lattice and thus breaks it apart , see , for instance , fig .",
    "[ warp ] . in this scenario",
    "the quenched disorder on the thresholds and the non - uniform stress distribution combine to determine where the next break will occur .",
    "the stress distribution itself also continually changes as the damage spreads .    throughout the process ,",
    "the equilibrium stress field is re - calculated by use of eq .",
    "( [ ma2x ] ) each time a beam is removed .",
    "the stress field therefore relaxes at a rate much faster than the process by which the crack grows .",
    "hence , the model describes quasi - static fracture .",
    "the displacements of a real material , even if its geometry is essentially confined to a plane , will generally occupy three dimensions .",
    "for instance , when opposite forces are applied uniformly along the top and bottom edges of a sheet of paper , with the object of straining it to failure , significant displacements will be observed in the direction perpendicular to the sheet , see fig .",
    "this becomes especially evident wherever sizable cracks appear .",
    "reasons for this behaviour are deviations in the symmetry of the material itself , or its properties , about the plane through which the externally applied forces act . in some cases such deviations may simply correspond to an uneven thickness , or they may be caused by local variations in density , a gradient in the orientation of the micro structure , and so forth .    to include this behaviour , the plane beam model must incorporate at least two additional features .",
    "one is the random variation of the material in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "since lattice modeling reduces the material to a set of points corresponding to the nodes on a mathematically precise two - dimensional lattice , the most convenient approach is to impose a very small randomly chosen vertical displacement on each node .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section  [ vrn ] .",
    "the other feature to be included , and the topic of the present section , is the physics of the forces which create , and maintain , the out - of - plane displacement field .    in the buckling beam model",
    "we have one translational and one rotational displacement relevant to each of the principal axes , i.e. , six degrees of freedom , with the matrix system @xmath33=\\lambda               \\left[\\begin{array}{l }                        u_{i}\\\\                        v_{i}\\\\                        w_{i}\\\\                        x_{i}\\\\                        y_{i}\\\\                        z_{i}\\\\                     \\end{array }               \\right ]                \\label{ma3x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] replacing eq .",

    "if we consider @xmath111 , and move from left to right along the edge of the crack , beams are seen to be stretched wherever the slope is positive and compressed wherever it is negative . as the crack grows the net effect",

    "when a crack grows beyond a certain critical size , interaction between the stress field and random variations in the @xmath45-direction initiates out - of - plane displacements which ultimately result in a buckled lattice .",

    "the last two terms on the right - hand side of @xmath116    are identically zero while the terms @xmath117 and @xmath118 are very small in comparison with the leading axial term .",
    "the terms @xmath65 and @xmath113 , however , although being small in comparison with either @xmath119 or @xmath120 , are non - negligible .",
    "this owes to the fact that there is no physical obstruction in the lattice to inhibit displacements in the @xmath45-direction , i.e. , there is no leading @xmath121 term .",
    "moreover , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ 4beam ] , when the lattice is in an advanced state of buckling there will be regions where the out - of - plane buckling reaction is inclined with respect to the @xmath45-axis , resulting in contributions of the type @xmath122 .",
    "these are smaller than @xmath65 , but are also assumed to be non - negligible . in order to include such terms the axes are rotated to the local deflection of the lattice , whereupon the components along the @xmath41- , @xmath9- and @xmath45-axes are obtained .",
    "an example of the effect this has is when a large crack , perpendicular to the force couple , opens up in the center of the lattice , as in fig .",
    "[ warp ] or fig .",
    "although the initial displacement of the crack edges is normal to the rest plane , an in - plane component appears as the crack grows , i.e. , the near edge of the crack is pulled slightly back along the negative @xmath9-axis while the far edge is pulled forward in the opposite direction .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ 3comp ] , where in @xmath123 the rows nearest to the crack edges are displaced below or above the fixed values of the top and bottom rows . in the case of the near edge",
    "this means that displacements are negative , i.e. , they have moved slightly backwards with respect to their equilibrium positions in the unrestrained - strained lattice .",
    "these displacements become more pronounced as the crack grows , as can be seen from @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "it is particularly instructive to compare the displacements of a buckling lattice with those obtained for the same lattice when the out - of - plane degrees of freedom are suppressed . in fig .",
    "[ w4 ] a lattice of size @xmath126 is shown in four stages of crack advancement .",
    "the corresponding in - plane displacements of the crack - edges are shown as thick lines in fig .",
    "[ p8 ] , with thin lines representing the same lattice in a non - buckling fracture mode . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath103 displacements are seen to be confined between the fixed values of the top and bottom row , the physical structure of the lattice itself effectively acting as an obstruction to displacements outside this range . a further feature that can be noted concerns the aforementioned `` poisson '' contraction .",
    "this effect is seen to be present in a non - buckling lattice as well , although to a much lesser degree . as for the angular displacements",
    "@xmath76 ( not shown ) , these are seen to be somewhat larger in the buckling case , except for the peak values obtained at the crack tips , which are more or less the same .",
    "these peak values increase only as the crack nears the outer boundaries of the lattice , where @xmath102 is large .    in general , the expressions derived for force and moment from ref .",
    "@xcite are accurate for small displacements only .",
    "this assumption we simply extend to all displacements .",
    "a second reason for rotating the axes , then , is to conserve the consistency of the approximations used .",
    "to illustrate the point one may , for instance , regard a straight beam which , in its rest state , lies along the @xmath41-axis .",
    "the term @xmath127 then expresses the transverse force as a function of @xmath128 .",
    "when @xmath53 is large , however , and the coordinate axes are fixed , @xmath128 , in addition to the transverse force , also implies some measure of axial strain in the beam even though this effect has already been included via eq .",
    "( [ fiforce ] ) .",
    "hence , rotating the axes precludes the introduction of systematic errors , e.g. , due to angular deflections of the lattice .",
    "it also improves the quality of the approximations used since angular displacements are rendered less severe in a rotated coordinate system .",
    "large angular deflections usually involve a number of nodes on the lattice and hence by rotating the axes we avoid that too many errors accumulate .",
    "it should also be pointed out , moreover , that with three rotational degrees of freedom there will in principle be several displacement combinations which correspond to a given space orientation of the beam axis .",
    "hence the projection of forces into the @xmath34- @xmath35- and @xmath36-planes is an approximation based on the assumption that large deflections about more than one axis simultaneously are rare .",
    "otherwise the exact orientation of the beam would be history - dependent , i.e. , it would depend on the sequence in which the ( final ) angular displacements @xmath53 , @xmath129 and @xmath76 were incremented .",
    "the out - of - plane force components are small , but their collective effect has a significant impact on the stress field . in the presence of significant cracks there is a feedback from the @xmath45-displacements which allows the @xmath34-displacements of the buckled lattice to relax with respect to the @xmath34-displacements of the flat lattice .",
    "one example of this is the transverse compressive stress stored in the region in front of and behind the crack in the non - buckling lattice . buckling releases this stress , as can be seen in fig",
    ".  [ twox ] , where the @xmath16 component of eq .",
    "( [ sumx ] ) is shown in the non - buckling ( a ) and the buckling ( b ) cases . in",
    "( a ) a region of compressive stress confined between the crack tips is seen to extend for a distance of about 6 - 8 rows away from the crack edge . in ( b ) only a vestige of this is left , and then only in the immediate vicinity of the crack .",
    "the tensile stress at the crack tips increases slightly in the buckled configuration .    in the non - buckling beam model , the extra non - linear terms which arise when the beam is simultaneously bent while under axial compression , or tension",
    ", are of lesser importance .",
    "all forces now act within the structure which defines the plane so that , in calculating the in - plane displacement field , corrections such as those due to @xmath76 in eq .  ( [ limxx ] ) may be neglected . the out - of - plane displacement field , on the other hand , is obtained from an equilibrium state in force and moment between a number of terms which are individually small .",
    "for instance , the axial , transverse and buckling components which make up the @xmath16 contribution to eq .",
    "( [ zf ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ compz1 ] . here",
    "the vertical scales on the three subplots have been adjusted to the relative sizes of the components .",

    "[ t ]    [ b ]    at the onset of buckling the axial and transverse terms , @xmath130 and @xmath127 , are identically zero while the buckling term , @xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "[ bucfig ] , is non - zero . in this - situation",
    "the sum of contributions from @xmath131 is non - zero . as the out - of - plane deflection increases ,",
    "an equilibrium is approached where the sum of forces is zero . at this equilibrium the buckling terms , e.g. , terms such as @xmath65 in fig .",

    "hence , at the equilibrium , the most significant of the non - linear terms are those relevant to the momentum , @xmath132 being about five times larger than @xmath65 .",

    ".  [ 41cgr ] , at the onset of buckling , is the movement of the crack - edge as a function of time , the time - steps being defined by the iteration procedure which locates the equilibrium of force and moment . just before the point at which equilibrium",
    "is reached , all buckling terms are `` switched off '' whereupon the remaining forces set about to locate a new minimum of elastic energy .",
    "this new minimum , of course , is none other than the flat configuration . as would be expected , not only do terms such as @xmath65 and @xmath132 cause buckling , they also sustain it once it has been established .    finally some remarks on the angular correction in eq",
    "( [ fiforce ] ) , which is included to allow for the possibility that axial force may increase or decrease as a consequence of bending . in eq .",
    "( [ fiforce ] ) it is assumed that the additional elongation due to bending can be obtained from a multiplicative factor . this factor is based on the ratio of a circular arc  @xcite to a straight line , the former being the semi - circle defined by the angular difference @xmath133 at the end - points and the latter the line which connects these . on the level of the individual beam ,",
    "the presence of inflection points are neglected in this approximation . in other words ,",
    "up - down curvatures may only occur in combinations of two or more beams in an end - to - end alignment .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ fiforce ] ) , the effect of in - plane bending moments , or transverse displacements perpendicular to the rest axis of the beam , are neglected as contributions which would otherwise add to the axial length of a beam .",
    "an important feature to be included in the model is the random variation of the material in the out - of - plane direction , as was remarked in section  [ bbm ] . in thin materials such as paper , cloth , membranes and so forth ,",
    "the most important factor influencing the behaviour during fracture is not the three - dimensional structure of the material itself .",
    "rather it is the out - of - plane deflection of this structure which makes a difference .",
    "nevertheless , random variations in the thickness direction provide an important part of the mechanism which initiates buckling .",
    "this is because such variations combine with the externally applied force and the emerging cracks to create local forces and moments which are not perfectly aligned within the plane .",
    "once a buckled configuration has been established , however , the variation in the thickness direction is far less important .",
    "since we presently regard the out - of - plane deflection of a structure which has no vertical extent , buckling must be initiated by other means .",
    "specifically , in modeling the fracture process , the equilibrium stress field is re - calculated by use of eq .",
    "( [ ma3x ] ) after a beam has been removed . at each step of this process ,",
    "i.e. , for each beam removed , a sample - specific random noise in the form of a small vertical displacement is imposed on all nodes of the lattice .",
    "presently , we use a random number uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath134 $ ] . in the early stages of the fracture process , the stress field is calculated in the presence of these variations until buckling commences . before sizable cracks appear , forces combine to flatten out the vertical displacements . that is , a flat configuration is energetically preferred to begin with , and fracture propagates according to the non - buckling simulation . as significant cracks begin to appear , however , the conditions at some point become favourable for the out - of - plane components of the stress field to be realized , and buckling sets in . from here on the random noise is discarded , and the next displacement configuration is simply calculated from the previous coordinates . when the lattice has been broken , a new set of vertical displacements is generated for the next sample , i.e. , a sample - specific random noise is used .",
    "lattice buckling modes in the presence of a center - crack of size @xmath135 are shown in fig .",
    "the only disorder present here is that due to the out - of - plane initialization , but evidently a number of buckling modes may appear . in the following , cases where the deflection of the edges of the crack is to the same side , i.e. , up - up or down - down , are referred to as symmetric buckling , and cases where the deflection is to opposite sides is referred to as anti - symmetric buckling . in fig .",
    "[ disp ] , ( d ) and ( e ) are examples of the former , and ( f ) and ( h ) are examples of the latter .",
    "another buckling mode which frequently appears is that shown in ( a ) , ( g ) or ( j ) , where the main bulge at one of the crack edges is made up of four , rather than three , half - waves . based on the few dozen samples observed , ( a ) and ( j ) evolve into type ( d ) after a few more beams have been broken , and ( g ) into type ( e ) , i.e. , the symmetric buckling mode prevails in each case .",
    "however , due to the randomness introduced , examples such as ( h ) are not completely anti - symmetric about the neutral plane .",
    "hence , even for this simple crack configuration , the exact shape of the out - of - plane deflection can vary considerably .",
    "the overall shape , however , tends to fall within the main categories , i.e. , one of the two symmetric or anti - symmetric buckling modes .",
    "this way of initializing the out - of - plane deflection is suitable for studying disordered systems , where a lattice without any initial geometrical discontinuity is strained until random cracks begin to appear . as the cracks grow buckling sets in at some point , depending on the configuration , position and size of the initial cracks .",
    "another way of initializing the out - of - plane deflection is to impose a small vertical deflection on a very few nodes in strategic positions .",
    "this is most practical when studying an `` ideal '' buckling scenario , such as the fracture of a non - disordered plate with a perfect center - crack .",
    "in order to study how buckling affects the fracture properties of a two - dimensional structure an appropriate breaking criterion should be chosen .",
    "as previously mentioned , this can be done to suit a range of engineering requirements .",
    "often the mode of rupture in the out - of - plane direction is radically different from that which takes place within the plane . in paper or cloth , for instance , the phenomenon which first springs to mind is tearing .",
    "the energy required to propagate a crack across a given area in tear mode is much less than that which causes the same area to fracture in pure tensile loading .",
    "this is especially the case with paper .",
    "out - of - plane contributions to the breaking criterion must be included by some other mechanism than that provided by eq .",
    "( [ tresca ] ) , since the latter is relevant to regions which are comparable in size to a beam .",
    "the stress intensification due to buckling , on the other hand , is due to much smaller regions ,",
    "i.e. , comparable in extent to the sharp crack tip .",
    "one way of enhancing the stress due to buckling is to combine torsion with axial stress . the larger the load , the more sensitive the beam will be to the presence of a given amount of torque .",
    "compressive loads are assumed to alleviate the torsional moment , but only to a very small degree .",
    "hence , the breaking criterion can be stated as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the effective stress , @xmath138 the torque , and @xmath139 the combined bending moment . with @xmath14 and @xmath83 denoting the width and thickness , respectively , of the beam , @xmath140 is the aspect ratio of the cross section , and @xmath141 is the enhancement factor in eq .",
    "( [ ft ] ) .    considering fig .",
    "[ 2x50 ] , the breaking stress is increased in case ( b ) and also in case ( a ) provided the deflections in front of and behind the crack are not congruent .",
    "when the bulges are completely symmetric , however , ( a ) does not intensify the breaking stress and thus contradicts experimental findings .",
    "another possibility is to assume a crack - tip stress enhancement which depends on the out - of - plane bending moment . here",
    "the in - plane displacement component @xmath103 observed in fig .",
    "[ p8 ] , i.e. , the backward and forward movement of the crack edge , creates an angular displacement about the @xmath41-axis . for a sufficiently thin plate",
    "the resistance towards bending will not be sufficient to halt the out - of - plane deflection once it has commenced , since the forces involved act over a region much larger than the immediate neighbourhood of the crack . due to the short distance which separates the top and bottom surfaces",
    ", the resulting `` lever - arm '' effect creates an asymmetric stress - gradient across the crack front in the direction of the thickness . whereas tensile force on the concave side is then reduced , it increases on the convex side .",
    "this increase comes in addition to the stress already concentrated along the crack front , i.e. , the very presence of a crack creates a screening effect which re - distributes the in - plane stresses so as to cause a build - up in the load at the crack tips . for a crack that has grown to an extent which allows buckling to occur , this in -",
    "plane stress is significant .",
    "the crack - tip opening angle also plays an important role . buckling in brittle materials , for instance ,",
    "is known to have a profound effect on the maximum load the system can tolerate before breaking . in a fem study by seshadri and newman  @xcite a hypothetical very large critical crack - tip opening angle was used to model buckling in a ductile material .",
    "strength reduction in this case was found to be significantly smaller than for brittle materials .    in the beam model ,",
    "the crack tip is never sharper than exactly one beam length . to emulate the above stress enhancement due to out - of - plane bending we instead imagine a sharp crack",
    "to be embedded within that beam which on the lattice defines the tip of the crack , and consider a combination of axial stress and moment .",
    "out - of - plane bending modes are shown in figs .",
    "[ uu ] and  [ du ] , where the displacements of the schematic lattice at the top have been exaggerated somewhat to illustrate the point .",
    "specifically , the @xmath45-displacements of contour b have been scaled up 100 times with respect to those of contour a , which itself is scaled up with respect to the horizontal extent of the lattice .",
    "the in - plane @xmath9-displacements have also been adjusted accordingly .",
    "experimental evidence indicates that the stress enhancement at the crack tips is more or less similar in the symmetric and anti - symmetric buckling modes . to incorporate this we distinguish between the two cases .",

    "otherwise , @xmath166 might probably be used in cases where we are interested in features which depend on the internal processes of the fracture mechanism , such as the roughness exponent of crack interfaces .    to guard against unphysical breaks , we introduce @xmath167 which contributes when one or both nearest lateral neighbours are intact , and @xmath168 which contributes when a certain number of neighbours have been broken . for any node @xmath10",
    ", the array @xmath169 now keeps track of the status of the beam which extends away from @xmath10 in the direction of the @xmath9-axis , i.e. , it remembers whether this is broken or intact , respectively . the combined expression , @xmath170 has the property @xmath171 as has @xmath172 governing cracks in the normal direction .",
    "in other words , eq .  ( [ disco ] ) ensures that the stress enhancement mechanism is activated only in cases where the lateral neighbour on one side is intact while simultaneously a certain number of beams , defining a minimum crack length @xmath173 , are broken on the other side .    in most cases",
    "the operator @xmath174 is not necessary .",
    "it has been included to avoid cracking being induced near the top and bottom rows of the lattice .",
    "for very large systems , and especially in cases where @xmath1 is significantly larger than @xmath163 , breaks sometimes occur due to the large angular gradients in beams extending up from @xmath93 or down from @xmath175 , see , for instance , figs .",
    "[ uu ] and  [ du ] . in the present formalism",
    "the properties of beams with inflection points are not considered , the smallest crack that can cause buckling , i.e. , a bulge consisting of at least three half - waves , is therefore approximately @xmath176 .",
    "this is confirmed in numerical runs for systems with small @xmath1 , but where @xmath177 .",
    "a problem with using such a large value of @xmath173 is that it excludes cracks inclined at an angle with respect to the horizontal . over a wide range of system parameters and external boundary conditions ,",
    "however , @xmath178 was found to be adequate .",
    "[ t ]    in the limit of no buckling , i.e. , @xmath179 or @xmath180 , eq .  ( [ bcri ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ tresca ] ) .",
    "in other words , if buckling is not activated , then neither is the stress enhancement mechanism in the fracture criterion .    finally , in order to illustrate how eq .",
    "( [ bcri ] ) , with eqs .",
    "( [ momdef ] ) to  ( [ lresu ] ) defining the stress enhancement mechanism , works within our model of buckling , we consider the buckling response ratio of the residual strength of the system .",
    "that is , @xmath181 , where @xmath182 and @xmath183 represent the maximum applied external force a restrained or buckled plate , respectively , can tolerate before breaking apart .",
    "early experimental results show that the decrease in strength due to buckling increases as the ratio of the crack - length @xmath184 to the thickness @xmath83 is increased .",
    "a linear relationship was proposed by kuhn and figge  @xcite which , in the case of brittle materials , has been shown to agree well with more recent fem calculations  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ kuhn ] , results obtained with the beam model are compared with the kuhn - figge relationship . a small correction to the size of the central crack has been made to account for the finite size of the beams .",
    "the effect is very small , shifting the values of the smallest systems slightly to the left , thus improving the agreement with the kuhn - figge relationship from very good to excellent .",
    "to summarize , we have included the additional degrees of freedom necessary to describe the interaction of cracks with buckling in the elastic beam model .",
    "this model is stochastic in nature , so that sheets with random cracking at any level of meso - structural disorder can be studied , including systems with no disorder .",
    "in addition to important issues of practical relevance in traditional fracture mechanics , such as strength properties and stability , the present model also enables fundamental aspects of fracture in random media to be explored .",
