    "the inversion distribution of a population for an electron  hole system is one or two orders of magnitude higher than the mott transition density .",
    "if an exciton - related recombination is used as the mechanism of laser action , the resultant threshold value is expected to be two or three orders of magnitude lower with higher quantum efficiency .",
    "because of this expectation , interest has recently been shown in zinc oxide ( zno ) , the band gap of which is in the ultraviolet range .",
    "in addition , the exciton binding energy ( ebe ) of zno is rather large ( 60  mev ) compared with those of other semiconductors such as group ii - selenides or group iii - nitrides .",
    "thus , the advantage of zno is that excitons can exist stably even at room temperature ( rt ) and even under a high - density condition .",
    "atomic layer control technology in the laser - assisted molecular - beam - epitaxy ( lmbe ) of oxides has advanced remarkably since the discovery of high - temperature superconductors . in response to this , we started study of zno epitaxial growth for the development of the short - wavelength semiconductor optoelectronics .",
    "at first , we adopted sapphire as substrates that had large lattice - mismatch ( 18% ) with zno .",
    "optical and structural properties of zno epitaxial layers deposited on sapphire has been investigated .",
    "these studies revealed that the zno epilayers are adapted for the optoelectronic applications with the following aspects :    1 .",
    "laser oscillation of excitonic origin was observed at room - temperature .",
    "grain boundaries in the epilayers act as longitudinal cavities",
    "band gap energies can be tuned by preparing the ( zn , mg)o and ( zn , cd)o solid solutions  @xcite .",
    "3 .   growth of zno/(mg , zn)o multi - quantum wells ( mqws ) were succeeded .",
    "4 .   optical properties of these mqws were investigated .",
    "excitonic luminescence accompanied by the quantum size effect at low temperatures was observed  @xcite .",
    "however , the abovementioned studies have also revealed some problems ( unsatisfactory properties of zno epilayers ) that are unavoidable as long as lattice - mismatched substrates are used .",
    "these zno thin films are indeed epitaxial but stay multicrystalline in nature having incoherent grain boundaries .",
    "these grain boundaries seem to be useful for observing the excitonic laser action because they can function as mirrors of a longitudinal cavity .",
    "the electrical properties of such films are , however , rather poor , as represented by a typical electron concentration of @xmath0  @xmath1 and a typical hall mobility of @xmath210 @xmath3/v s at room temperature .",
    "the electrical properties of the epilayers are clearly inferior to those of bulk single crystals ( @xmath4  @xmath1 and @xmath2200 @xmath3/v s ) .",
    "the crystallinity of epilayers is also inferior .",
    "in addition , the fact that neither luminescence ( photoluminescence ) nor a stimulated emission could be observed at room temperature in mqws grown on the sapphire substrates is a problem .",
    "the current advanced technology of compound semiconductors can not be fully utilized in the case of such inferior thin films and quantum wells ( qws ) .",

    "samples of mqws ( 10 periods ) were grown by the method of laser molecular - beam epitaxy .",
    "a qw is defined as stacks alternatively deposited by using two kinds of very thin semiconductor layers ( wells and barriers ) that have different band gap energies .",
    "zno was used as a well layer material and a znmgo solid solution , the band gap of which is larger than that of zno , was used as a barrier layer .",
    "the mg concentration dependence of the band gap energy is given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the in - plane lattice mismatch between zno and these alloys is very small .",
    "the mg concentration was set to 0.12 or 0.27 , because the barrier height could be changed by a change in its concentration .",
    "eighteen samples with different mg concentrations and well widths ( @xmath10 ) , 6.9 to 46.5  , were prepared in order to estimate the @xmath10 dependence of their optical properties .",
    "barrier layer thickness was fixed at 50  .",
    "the samples were grown by the `` combinatorial '' method , the concept of which has been explained in the review article  @xcite .",
    "readers should refer to related papers in which the apparatuses developed for efficient structural and optical characterizations are described  @xcite .",
    "here , we describe briefly the improvements in the properties of zno epilayers achieved by using lattice - matched scam substrates .",
    "observation of the surface morphology of zno / scam epilayers revealed that the steps have a flat terrace in the scale of an atomic level and have a height of 0.26  nm ( corresponding to the charge neutral unit ) .",
    "comparison of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) curves showed that the crystallinity of these epilayers had reached almost the same level as that of a single crystal  @xcite .",
    "these films also have high carrier mobility ( 100  @xmath3/vs ) and low residual carrier concentration ( @xmath11  @xmath1 ) .",
    "even if the growth temperature is lowered to about 200  @xmath12c , the high level of crystallinity was not changed .",
    "recently , the formation of epilayers that have high resistance in which hall measurement can not be performed , and that have the high mobility ( @xmath13200  @xmath3/vs ) has been achieved . in order to examine the activation efficiency of donor doping , _",

    "this was not the case for zno epilayers grown on sapphire substrates  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ abs_epi ] .",
    "the two excitonic peaks became too broad to be resolved because the damping constant of the excitons became larger due to the inferior crystallinity , as mentioned earlier .",
    "such undesired broadening could be avoided in the case of zno epilayers grown on scam substrates .",
    "the fwhms of the exciton absorption bands of these samples were similar to those of bulk crystals  @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that the threshold for the stimulated emission is also significantly improved  @xcite .",
    "such improvements in electrical , structural and optical properties would not be possible if a sapphire substrate is used .",
    "it can be concluded that quality of these single - crystalline zno epilayers satisfies the stringent requirements for being regarded as compound semiconductors .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the mqws showed the following drawbacks due to the formation of rough interfaces caused by the use of lattice - mismatched substrates : ( 1 ) controllability of layer thickness is not sufficient for quantum confinement effect to be elicited in the case of @xmath15  , and ( 2 ) pl efficiency is not high enough to enable observation of the exciton emission at rt  @xcite .",
    "these problems must be overcome for an optoelectrical device to be operable at rt .",
    "these problems , which were unavoidable when the sapphire substrates were used , could be eliminated by using scalmgo@xmath5 substrates  @xcite .",
    "the xrd patterns of the mqws showed bragg diffraction peaks and clear intensity oscillations due to laue patterns corresponding to the layer thickness .",
    "this indicates a high crystallinity and a high degree of thickness homogeneity .",
    "furthermore , observation of the atomic force microscopy ( afm ) images revealed that the surface of an mqw is composed of well - defined atomically flat terraces and steps corresponding to the charge neutral unit of zno .",
    "therefore , the interface roughness in the heterostructure can not be larger than 0.26 nm .",

    "the absorption peak energies both in zno epilayers and in mqws are monotonically decreasing functions of temperature as was revealed in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to the temperature - induced shrinkage of the fundamental energy gap .    in general , when a dominant pl peak is assigned to a radiative recombination of localized excitons , its peak energy blue - shifts with increase in temperature in a range of low temperatures and red - shifts at higher temperatures .",

    "the temperature dependence of the recombination mechanism for localized excitons is thought to be closely related to the temperature variation in the decay time constant of their pl .",

    "the @xmath41 values exhibit nonmonotonical behavior with respect to temperature ; the value increased in a low temperature range and decreased above a certain critical temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the recombination mechanism for localized excitons can be explained  @xcite as follows . for 5",
    "k < @xmath43<50  k , the relatively long relaxation time of excitons gives the excitons more opportunity to relax down into lower energy tail states caused by the inhomogeneous potential fluctuations before recombining .",
    "this is because radiative recombination processes dominate in this temperature range .",
    "this behavior produces a red - shift in the peak energy position with increasing temperature . for 50",
    "k < @xmath44<95  k , the exciton lifetimes decrease with increasing temperature .",

    "( iv ) at temperatures above 200  k , since the excitons are less affected by the temperature - induced rapid change in their lifetimes and since the relaxation rate of the excitons increased due to an increase in the phonon population , blue - shift behavior becomes less pronounced .",

    "mg@xmath63o mqws ( b ) and ( c )  @xcite . ]",
    "thus , as a result of careful comparison with that of a zno thin film , it became clear that the mechanism of this stimulated emission is inelastic scattering processes between the excitons .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10 dependence of ebes can be experimentally determined from analysis of the energy position of the _ p_-line . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bindingenergy ] ( right axis ) , when @xmath10 decreased , the ebe increased up to about 90  mev and exceeded @xmath34 ( 72  mev ) .",
    "this enhancing effect is due to the quantum confinement effect .",
    "it has been revealed that these estimated ebes approximately agree with the theoretical values  @xcite .",
    "if qw structures were used , the phonon scattering process and thermo - broadening effect of excitonic linewidth can be controlled .",
    "these are favorable from the viewpoint of application .",
    "combinatorial concept - aided techniques adopted in the growth of our samples suppressed the variations in crystal growth conditions and hence the undesired uncertainty in the deduced spectroscopic results . in a related review article , the benefit of the combinatorial technique is described in detail  @xcite .",
    "for example , the well width dependence of the radiative and nonradiative recombination times of localized excitons was estimated by time - resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "well width dependence of _ biexciton _ binding energy was also estimated  @xcite .",
    "in addition , optical properties of ( cd , zn)o/(mg , zn)o mqws have not ever explored so far except our work  @xcite .",
    "these structures are advantageous from the viewpoint of almost perfect in - plane lattice - matching .",
    "if a short - wavelength ( uv region ) semiconductor laser using exciton transitions in low - dimensional crystals ( e.g. , quantum wells ) of zno can be produced , it is expected that threshold of the laser action will become lower than that of a laser using an ordinary recombination mechanism of electrons and holes .",
    "this study has shown , through experiments on optical excitation , that it is possible to produce a laser with a low threshold ( i.e. , small driving current density ) .",
    "laser action due to the effect of a longitudinal cavity using grain boundaries is no longer observed in zno epitaxial layers deposited on lattice - matched substrates , because their level of crystallinity has been greatly improved .",
    "moreover , they no longer show a polycrystalline nature ( i.e. , assembly of hexagonal pillar prisms ) . the corresponding resonance cavity structure has disappeared .    moreover , a _",
    "p - n _ junction is essential for the production of a current injection laser .",
    "a zno crystal usually shows _ n_-type conductivity and it has not been possible to produce a _ p_-type layer with low resistance .",
    "such a feature of widegap semiconductors is called unipolarity in carrier doping . in this chapter",
    ", we have not discussed this problem .",
    "such high - quality zno qws deposited on lattice - matched substrates are expected to have many applications for uv optoelectronics devices .",
    "various applications of zno , such as its use in transparent electric - conduction films or a surface acoustic - wave device , are well - known",
    ". new function of this substance have been found through research on high - quality single - crystalline thin films grown by the use of the laser - assisted molecular - beam - epitaxy .",
