    "it has recently been demonstrated that the color symmetry of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) might be spontaneously broken through the formation of a diquark condensate .",
    "this phase is metastable at zero and small matter density @xcite but becomes stable and replaces the usual chiral - broken phase at some critical density @xcite .",
    "condensation of diquarks is analogous to cooper pairing of electrons in bcs theory , in which the massive photon is the microscopic embodiment of the meissner effect . in qcd",
    "the gauge group is @xmath0 , but the consequences are similar : gauge bosons ( gluons ) become massive due to their interaction with the correlated fermions ( quarks ) . not every gluon species becomes massive , since the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath2 and the three gluons of the residual @xmath1 remain massless . among the five massive modes ,",
    "four are degenerate and the mass of the fifth is @xmath3 times that of the others .",
    "this is comparable to the symmetry - broken phase of the electroweak theory .",
    "thus the direct analogy is to the higgs mechanism , with the diquark field forming a composite scalar and its nonzero vev generating a dynamical higgs effect .    in this paper",
    "this mechanism is analyzed microscopically . as the source of diquark condensation we will use the effective quark action obtained by averaging over instanton configurations @xcite . in this approach to the qcd vacuum , all information from the large background gauge fields ( instantons )",
    "is encoded in the non - local form of the t hooft interaction and the two instanton parameters , average size ( @xmath4 ) and number density ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this procedure replaces dynamical gluons with classical , nonperturbative field solutions , ignoring quantum gluonic fluctuations .",
    "the reintroduction of gluonic fluctuations will require a gauge - invariant perturbative modification of the t hooft vertex .",
    "a direct consequence of gauge invariance is the transverse polarization operator , which we will compute explicitly .",
    "this is the main result of the paper as from it we obtain the gluon masses .",
    "since the dynamical higgs effect is interesting regardless of density , we will first consider the vacuum alone ( chemical potential @xmath6 ) , although in this case the superconductor is only metastable @xcite .",
    "the gluon masses are found to be proportional to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the superconducting gap , the scale of which is a nonperturbative one set by the strength of the instanton background . extending the formalism to finite chemical potential @xmath9",
    "is straightforward , given that the density dependence of the propagators and effective action are known @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we avoid exact calculations at @xmath10 . instead ,",
    "for simplicity we assume that the in - medium gluon masses are determined by the behavior of @xmath11 up to and somewhat above the critical value of @xmath12 mev . at this density ,",
    "the point at which the color superconductor becomes the stable phase , we find that the gluon masses are about 120 mev .    for gluons",
    "the color - breaking meissner masses are a primary ramification of the superconducting state , however this is not the only effect of a quark medium .",
    "there will be additional contributions , among them a debye screening mass of the order of @xmath13 , which do not break color symmetry .",
    "when the density becomes large , the debye mass increases and instantons are screened out of the picture . yet diquark condensation persists , now due to perturbative gluon exchange @xcite , and at asymptotically large density the meissner masses are also proportional to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "so while one still has quark pairing , any matching between low and high density mechanisms remains unclear .",
    "in this paper we consider the case of two massless flavors , which is expected to be relevant at finite - density chiral restoration given a relatively large strange quark mass @xcite .",
    "instantons are euclidean pseudoparticles , and thus all calculations will be in euclidean space .",
    "in section 2 we recall those features of the ordinary higgs mechanism ( based on elementary scalar fields ) which will also be relevant for composite scalars . in section 3",
    "the instanton - induced action including perturbative gluons will be formulated . in section 4",
    "the diquark gap equation is reviewed , and in section 5 the color current is determined .",
    "in section 6 we sum a set of quark - quark correlation functions to recover the nambu - goldstone modes of the theory , a necessary exercise as these will mix with the longitudinal gluons .",
    "these ingredients are assembled into the gluon polarization operator in section 7 , which taken in the static limit corresponds to a mass .",
    "section 8 compares the result to chiral symmetry breaking , and in section 9 this result is discussed and conclusions are drawn .",
    "the dynamical higgs mechanism , though technically more involved , does not differ much from the ordinary one .",
    "let us denote the quark bilinear combination @xmath14 where greek letters denote color , @xmath15 flavor , and @xmath16 are spinor indices of the left ( @xmath17 ) and right ( @xmath18 ) components of the quark field @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting complex field @xmath20 is a lorentz scalar isoscalar field belonging to the fundamental representation of the @xmath0 group . to support gauge invariance",

    "however , it deviates from unity even for the elementary field when one takes into account the perturbative virtual emission of particles . for the fields that are composite from the start",
    "there is no reason for @xmath24 to be unity .",
    "this quantity is _ a priori _ unknown and should be determined from a dynamical calculation , as will follow below .",
    "we stress , however , that the relative weights of the three terms in eq.([lagr ] ) are fixed by gauge invariance .    if the scalar field @xmath20 develops a nonzero vev signaling the diquark condensation , @xmath26 ( it can be always arranged along the third color axis and made real ) , then gluons obtain a mass matrix @xmath27 the symmetry breaking pattern is , thus , @xmath28 ; three gluons corresponding to the unbroken @xmath1 subgroup remain massless , four gluons obtain masses proportional the higgs vev , and the fifth gluon is @xmath3 times as heavy .",
    "this relation will be , of course , reproduced for composite higgs fields as well , as it follows from symmetry considerations alone .",
    "this simple elementary - higgs model also provides an alternative way to find the gluon masses , which we will generalize to the case of the composite higgs field .",

    "[ hpol ] will be replaced by loop diagrams , formed by quarks , however , the general setting will be rather similar to this simple case : there will be a pole contribution from the would - be goldstone bosons in the intermediate state , and there will be a ` contact ' term .",
    "the resulting polarization operator will be transverse , _ provided _",
    "one takes a conserved color current .",
    "following a long tradition of instanton phenomenology , we assume the following :    * instantons are the dominant nonperturbative contribution to low - energy qcd , and * low and high momentum scales are safely separable for quark and gluon fields .    these assumptions are supported _ a posteriori _ by instanton - based phenomenology of the vacuum , as reviewed in ref .",
    "instantons break chiral symmetry spontaneously and axial @xmath34 anomalously , both at a satisfactory magnitude .",
    "instanton - induced interactions also provide the necessary @xmath35 attraction for a diquark condensate , nonperturbatively .",
    "here we use a formulation which not only relies on the separation of quark zero and free modes , but also explicitly includes both instantons and perturbative gluons .",
    "gluons are separated into classical instantons and quantum corrections , which we write as @xmath36 where the sums are over all instantons and anti - instantons , each given by the t hooft solution in the singular gauge @xcite .",
    "although there is a certain distribution of instanton sizes ( see , for example , @xcite ) we simply use the average value , @xmath37 fm , in all calculations .",
    "the main idea of this paper is to examine the effects of color superconductivity on the gluonic excitations above the instanton vacuum , which means we must retain and analyze the @xmath38 .",
    "hereafter , the term ` gluon ' will refer to the perturbative gauge fluctuation above the instanton background , @xmath38 .",
    "the origin the t hooft interaction is explained in the literature @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "to summarize , the low momentum quarks are approximated by zero mode solutions in the presence of one instanton .",
    "averaging over the instanton ensemble generates a vertex for dynamical quarks , mediated by the zero modes , which can be treated perturbatively when the instanton liquid is reasonably dilute .",

    "we now consider the effective action itself . in the quark sector",
    "it is a non - local one of four - fermion operators , since quarks are connected to instantons via the quark zero modes whose spatial extent is of the order of the instanton size , @xmath4 .",

    "when calculating bulk vacuum properties one need nt worry about quantum corrections as observables are seldom sensitive to them , however in this case the dependence is crucial",
    ". a limited literature does exist in which non - local interactions are modified to be gauge invariant @xcite and we follow the same procedure here .",
    "in particular , we will minimally modify the effective action ( [ oldsint ] ) to suit the present needs .",
    "we will take the non - local four - fermion interaction as the starting point .",
    "it then becomes a matter of multiplying each quark operator by a path - ordered exponential in the background of the perturbative gluon field @xmath48 , replacing as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the perturbative field .",
    "as has been pointed out in the cited works , the choice of path integrated over is not unique . yet",
    "as long as these factors transform as @xmath51 by virtue of path ordering , the action will be gauge invariant .",
    "this remains true when , as in this case , the interaction involves an explicit color average since overall color is conserved .",
    "we are also concerned only with the static limit , @xmath52 , in which _ results are independent of any particular choice of path . _    thus we write the modified interaction as a product over flavors , @xmath53 ,   \\label{sint } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] noting that this includes terms of all orders in @xmath54 .",
    "calculating the gluon polarization operator will require the linear and quadratic contributions .    to this interaction term one must add the usual quark kinetic term , minimally modified to preserve gauge invariance : @xmath55 consequently",
    ", the color current obtained from the variation of the action in respect to @xmath56 will have two contributions : one is the ordinary one arising from the minimal coupling ( [ qkin ] ) and the other arising from the non - local interaction term ( [ sint ] ) .",

    "all expressions are euclidean and the notation generally follows that of ref .",

    "the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry was also a central concern in that work , whereas here we are considering restored chiral symmetry .",
    "the main result of refs .",
    "@xcite is a competition between chiral and diquark condensates at zero temperature and nonzero quark chemical potential . in all cases ,",
    "there is a phase transition from a low - density phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry to a high - density one of color superconductivity .",
    "while technically involved , our previous results arise from an effective four - quark interaction which allows for pairing of quarks as in the bcs theory . the instanton model retains more of qcd s features than _ ad hoc _ models , notably the anomalous breaking of axial @xmath34 and transmutation of dimensions , and is constructed in a more systematic way from that underlying theory .",
    "a prominent feature of the instanton approach used here is the determination of the effective four - fermion coupling constant @xmath57 .",

    "we have analyzed the problem of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking brought about by a diquark condensate .",
    "since the broken symmetry is continuous and gauged the resulting nambu - goldstone modes do not remain in the spectra , instead mixing with the longitudinal components of the gauge fields to produce massive gauge bosons .",
    "this , a dynamical higgs mechanism , can be called the color meissner effect in the context of color superconductivity .    to reveal the gauge boson masses mathematically",
    "one has to compute the polarization operator , which ought to be transverse , @xmath193 where the massless pole @xmath102 is the manifestation of the nambu ",
    "goldstone intermediate state .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath194 gives the mass of the gauge boson . in this paper",
    ", we explicitly solved this problem for the case of diquark condensation as induced by the instanton background , the effective action from which we found necessary to modify in order to maintain a conserved color current .",
    "through computing the gluon polarization operators to order @xmath111 we find the effective gluon masses to be on the order of the diquark gap .",
    "the three gluons comprising the residual @xmath1 group remain massless and hence a quark - gluon medium would become color - biased in such a phase . the analysis here was done in the limit of zero temperature and , initially , vanishing chemical potential @xmath9 , though strictly speaking at zero @xmath9 the color superconductor is only metastable with the ground state being the usual chiral - broken phase .",
    "we then estimated finite - density dependence of the calculated quantities . at the critical density , where one expects the phase transition to the color superconducting phase",
    ", we deduce that the meissner masses of the @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 gluon are about 120 mev and the @xmath199 gluon has a mass about 140 mev .",
    "these quantities would be of physical relevance should a low temperature , high density region become experimentally accessible . at a chemical potential",
    "low enough to leave the instanton background approximately unchanged ( @xmath200 0.6 gev ) , the instanton effects analyzed here would still be present and likely dominant .",
    "in computing the coupling of the nambu - goldstone modes to gluons we have established that their mixing is described by an effective theory in which the composite diquark is replaced by a complex scalar in the fundamental representation of the gauge group , @xmath201 .",
    "the effective lagrangian coincides with that of elementary scalar field covariantly coupled to gluons , aside from an overall factor @xmath24 which is the ` wave function renormalization ' of the composite scalar field .",
    "there are no _ a priori _ reasons for this factor to be close to unity ( as it is in the case of a weakly - coupled elementary higgs field ) , and indeed we find a substantial deviation from unity .",
    "meanwhile , it is a crucial factor for the estimate of the meissner mass .",
    "if electromagnetic interactions were taken into account , the gluon @xmath159 will invariably mix with the ( massless ) photon .",
    "this mixing , estimated from general arguments to be rather small @xcite , reorganizes the fields into a massive ` new gluon ' and massless ` new photon ' .",
    "given that the gluonic sector alone can be recast as a yang - mills - higgs theory , this additional result would complete the analogy to the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the phase transition between ordinary chiral - broken phase and the color superconductivity .",
    "the point is that all estimates existing in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) indicate that this phase transition happens alarmingly ` early ' : taken literary , the claim is that the interior region of a heavy nucleus is actually in a ` boiling ' state .",
    "however , those estimates generally neglect the influence of the dense medium on the gluonic background fluctuations which induce the color superconductivity itself .",
    "the meissner mass of about 150 mev found here is a large quantity and , together with the debye mass and other effects , will suppress instantons .",
    "therefore , by taking into account back - influence effects one has a chance to ` save ' ordinary nuclear matter from a premature phase transition by moving that transition to higher densities .",
    "although the instanton density is not expected to change significantly for any chemical potential below the inverse instanton size ( 600 mev ) , at and beyond this point perturbative meissner and screening masses will become increasingly important . at asymptotically large densities",
    "perturbative gluon exchange is the source of diquark condensation @xcite , whereas in this work we have been concerned with the low density , nonperturbative regime . determining the behavior at a moderate density scale  which would be an interpolation between the two  is necessary if one wishes to confidently consider signals of color superconductivity in any potentially realizable situation , be it in some future heavy - ion collider or a neutron star .",
