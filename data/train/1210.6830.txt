    "the demonstration of ultraslow group velocity ( @xmath2 ) of light @xcite in ultracold atoms by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite has inspired appealing applications @xcite . besides the slow light , superluminal phenomena ( @xmath3 is negative ) was observed in atomic caesium gas @xcite and in alexandrite crystal @xcite .",
    "slow and superluminal light have also been observed in optomechanical systems @xcite whose superior delay and advancement times , smaller dimensions , and less demanding thermal requirements makes them attractive for quantum optomechanical memory and classical signal processing applications @xcite .",
    "recent proposal such as optomechanical cavity with a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite and one - sided cavity with a nanomechanical mirror ( nmm ) @xcite , which is recently demonstrated @xcite , are promising but either too costly and difficult to implement @xcite or not sufficiently flexible enough to realize both superluminal and slow light effects simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency has been demonstrated very recently in a room temperature cavity optomechanics setup formed by a thin semitransparent membrane within a fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "we address the question of how more controllable and simpler optomechanical systems , that can simultaneously exhibit larger delay and advancement times , can be realized .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the time delay of the weak probe field at the probe resonance in a double - ended high quality cavity with a moving nmm under the action of coupling laser .",
    "we find that the group delay can be controlled by the power of the coupling field .",
    "the time delay is positive which corresponds to ultraslow light propagation ( subluminal propagation ) when there is a strong coupling between the nano - oscillator and the cavity .",
    "in contrast to single - ended cavities , only allowing for superluminal propagation @xcite , possibility of both superluminal and subluminal propagation regimes are found .",
    "the magnitude of the group delay is @xmath4ms at a very low pumping power of a few microwatts .",
    "the transmission group delay that we have found is larger than the group delay in a coupled bec - cavity system @xcite which is costly and difficult system to implement .",
