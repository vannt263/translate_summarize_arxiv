    "in early 1992 , the ultraluminous s5 quasar ( , @xmath0 ) underwent a prominent optical outburst ( von linde et al .",
    "1993 ) , which later led to enhanced variability in the mm- and cm- radio bands ( @xcite ) . at the time of the optical flaring ,",
    "the source also was in a bright state in the gamma - regime ( egret : fichtel et al .",
    "1994 ) and at soft x - rays ( rosat : @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the increased activity of the source , we started a high frequency vlbi monitoring program in 1993 in order to investigate the possible relation between broad - band changes in the flux density and structural variations in the jet on sub  milliarcsecond scales .",
    "the ejection of new vlbi jet components after major outbursts in the flux density has been observed also in a few other sources ( e.  g.   component ejection after optical flaring : babadzhanyants and belokon 1986 , @xcite ; ejection after radio flares : mutel et al .",
    "1990 , , wagner et al .",
    "1995a ) and seems to be a quite common phenomenon in compact flat spectrum radio sources ( blazars ) .    with the new data",
    "obtained for , it appears very likely that the relation between outbursts in the flux density observed at high frequencies and jet component ejection is not limited to the synchrotron regime ( e.g. optical - to - radio ) , but most probably covers a much wider spectral range ( gamma - to - radio ) , possibly the full electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "similar correlations between gamma - activity and jet activity were recently found also in a number of other sources , e.g. in 3c  273 ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1996 ) , 3c  279 ( wehrle et al .",
    "1994 ) , 0528 + 134 and 3c454.3 ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1995 ) , where the ejection of jet components could be related to gamma - flares , or enhanced levels of gamma - activity . however , in most of the published cases the frequency coverage is not as broad as presented here for .",
    "the quasar is a member of a complete flux density limited sample of 13 flat ",
    "spectrum radio sources ( eckart et al .  1986 & 1987 ) compiled from the 6 cm s5 survey ( khr et al .  1981 ) .",
    "the 13 sources of the sample are located in the northern polar cap ( @xmath3 ) and are regularly studied with vlbi at frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 22ghz ( cf .",
    "witzel et al .",
    "1988 and references therein ) . the vlbi data for now span a time range of more than 15 years ( 19831996 ) .",
    "the high dynamic range vlbi images of reveal a complex and wiggled one  sided core ",
    "jet structure ( eckart et al .",
    "1986 , @xcite ) .",
    "world - array vlbi images at 90 cm and 18 cm show the jet extending over more than 150milliarcseconds ( mas ) in direction to the outer arcsecond lobe seen with merlin and the vla ( @xcite ) . mainly from the vlbi monitoring at 6 cm ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1990b hereafter k90b , otterbein 1996 hereafter o96 ) , a very complex motion pattern is revealed , with jet components , moving at velocities ranging from subluminal ( @xmath4 ) to superluminal ( @xmath5 ) ( assuming @xmath6 and @xmath7 , throughout this paper ) .",
    "no systematic correlation between the speed of the jet and the separation of the components from the core seems to be present .",
    "the jet shows a noticeably structure , with lateral displacements of its ridge line ( kinks ) and oscillations of its transverse width ( k90b ) .    at cm - wavelengths , is strongly polarized ( @xmath8 at 5ghz ) .",
    "polarization vlbi images show a highly polarized jet with the magnetic field roughly following the bent ridge line ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the jet of is also highly magnetized .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the structural changes observed in the sub - milliarcsecond regions of the inner jet of during and after the optical outburst of 1992 . a more detailed discussion of the overall morphology and the spectral and kinematic properties of the milliarcsecond - jet will be given elsewhere .",

    " absorbed vlbi jets ( e.g. blandford and knigl 1979 ) , frequency dependent shifts of the relative positions of the vlbi components , caused by optical depth effects , are expected . the comparison of the relative component positions between the nearly simultaneous 8 , 15 and 22  ghz images , however , indicate that the position shifts in are relatively small ( @xmath10  mas ) . in the following ,",
    "we neglect such shifts due to opacity and plot in figure [ birth ] the relative separation from the core of b3 versus time .",
    "the data points line up very nicely , thus confirming indirectly the validity of our assumption of negligible opacity effects .",
    "furthermore , we find no evidence for non - linear motion , e.g. acceleration or motion along curved paths ( see also the nearly constant position angle of b3 in table [ rvst ] )",
    ".    a linear fit to the data yields an apparent angular separation rate of @xmath11  mas / yr corresponding to an apparent velocity of @xmath12 .",
    "this velocity is close to the speeds seen for the older components b & b2 ( k90b , o96 ) , and confirms the previous finding of relatively high velocities at small separations from the core ( note : components c1 and c2 move substantially slower , cf .",
    "linear back - extrapolation of the motion of b3 yields the time of zero separation of @xmath13 .",
    "this is close to the time of the strong optical flare observed in 1992.13 ( von linde et al .",
    "1993 , see figure [ fg : lightcurves ] ) . within possible extrapolation errors and due to the limited and partially incomplete time coverage of the optical flaring",
    ", it therefore appears that b3 was ejected _ during or shortly after _ ( @xmath14yrs ) the optical outburst .",
    "we study the correlation between the optical flaring and the ejection time of b3 in more detail in section [ sc : travel ] .",
    "figure [ fg : lightcurves ] shows the propagation of the outburst through the spectrum .",
    "such a behavior is readily described within the standard shock  in  jet models ( e.g. marscher & gear 1985 ) , in which a relativistic shock propagates along a synchrotron self - absorbed jet , causing ( at least qualitatively ) the observed frequency dependence .    from the data shown in figure [ fg : lightcurves ] and additional data from measurements made with the mpifr 100 m radio telescope at longer cm  wavelengths , we are able to follow the evolution of the radio spectrum and to determine the path of a local spectral excess , which propagated from higher to lower frequencies .    from our radio data , we first constructed quasi - simultaneous radio spectra covering the @xmath15ghz range .",
    "good spectral coverage is achieved in the period from 1992.05 to 1993.00 . to overcome the lack of frequency coverage at individual epochs , we binned the available data into 7 intervals , each of 50 days in duration .",
    "since the source did not show strong variations within the binning - timescale , we are confident that the averaging of the data within each bin is not causing large errors for our later derived turnover points .",
    "figure [ fg : spectrum ] ( top ) gives an example of such a radio spectrum .",
    "the long - term flux density monitoring of at cm - wavelengths shows longer periods of low or only moderately slow ( timescales of @xmath16years ) variability .",
    "one such period had occurred prior to the time of the optical activity in 1992 .",
    "we used the spectra from this period to determine the shape of the quiescent spectrum ( non - variable part ) . throughout the radio band considered",
    "( @xmath16 1100ghz ) it can be well represented by a simple power law ( @xmath17 ) , which we plot as dashed line in figure [ fg : spectrum ] ( top ) .    in order to determine the position ( @xmath18 , @xmath1 ) of the turnover point of the variable part of the radio spectrum",
    ", we now subtracted the same quiescent spectrum from our binned spectra .",
    "the fit of a homogeneous synchrotron component spectrum ( with spectral indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) to each of the residual spectra was rather unsatisfactory , indicating that the variable part of the radio spectrum can not be represented well enough by a single and homogeneous synchrotron component .",
    "a much better fit was achieved when we used @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the following we use the results from these fits .",
    "figure [ fg : spectrum ] ( bottom ) shows an example of such a fit for one of the spectra ( epoch 6 ) . from each of the fits to the 7 residual spectra , we determined the position of the spectral turnover . in figure [ fg : sm_num ]",
    "the turnover flux density @xmath1 is plotted versus turnover frequency @xmath2 as a function of time .",
    "the numbered labels at each position correspond to the following epochs : 1 - 1992.07 ( tjd 8650 ) , 2 - 1992.21 ( tjd 8700 ) , 3 - 1992.35 ( tjd 8750 ) , 4 - 1992.48 ( tjd 8800 ) , 5 - 1992.62 ( tjd 8850 ) , 6 - 1992.76 ( tjd 8900 ) , 7 - 1992.90 ( tjd 8950 ) .",
    "the measured path of the spectral turnover seems to follow a linear trend ( in the @xmath23 space ) , which can be interpreted within models invoking a shock moving along a relativistic synchrotron self  absorbed jet . in the model of marscher & gear ( 1985 ) and marscher ( 1990 ) , the spectral evolution is described by three subsequent phases of energy loss and radiation , the compton , synchrotron , and adiabatic phase . during the first two stages , the turnover flux rises with decreasing frequency , then remains nearly constant .",
    "the phase of adiabatic losses is characterized by a decrease of the flux density with decreasing turnover frequency .",
    "we therefore identify the spectral evolution seen in figure [ fg : sm_num ] with the adiabatic  loss stage .",
    "a power law fit ( the straight line in figure [ fg : sm_num ] ) to the path of the turnover point yields @xmath24 .",
    "we note that in figure [ fg : sm_num ] a slightly steeper slope is obtained , if the first data point ( point no .",
    "1 ) is not included in the fit . within the afore mentioned model ,",
    "it is possible that the spectral evolution from point no . 1 to no .",
    "2 reflects the transition from the synchrotron to the adiabatic cooling phase .",
    "if this is the case , the synchrotron loss dominated phase would have ceased @xmath25days after the onset of the optical flare .",
    "obviously observations much closer to the time of the outburst would have been required to study the synchrotron phase .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2 dependence determined in the previous section can be used for studying the relation between the spectral and kinematic properties of the relativistic jet in . despite some evidence for emission from an inhomogeneous synchrotron component ( @xmath21 ,",
    "see previous section ) , we postulate for the sake of simplicity , that the observed spectral variations are produced by a single , compact relativistic shock dominating the source radio emission , and associated with the core of the jet or an emitting region moving inside the jet within @xmath26mas distance from the core ( a distance comparable to the back  extrapolated separation of b3 at the last spectral epoch , 1992.9 ) .",
    "we use the formalism developed by marscher & gear ( 1985 ) , and account for possible variations of the doppler factor in the emitting region ( marscher 1990 ) . based on the synchrotron spectral index @xmath27 used for the spectral fitting",
    ", a power law electron energy distribution with @xmath28 is assumed .",
    "the magnetic field distribution along the jet axis @xmath29 is defined by an exponent @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 .",
    "the doppler factor is @xmath32 .",
    "the spectral evolution of the shock is then described by the variations of the turnover point : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the exponents @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the dominating type of the energy losses ( marscher 1990 , marscher et al .",
    "1991 , lobanov & zensus 1998 ) .",
    "following marscher ( 1990 ) , we obtain the following expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 during the adiabatic ",
    "loss stage : @xmath37 @xmath38    we now consider two cases : a )  a jet with transversal ( @xmath39 ) magnetic field , and b )  a jet with longitudinal ( @xmath40 ) magnetic field . with the measured @xmath41 , changes of the doppler factor and turnover frequency along the jet can be determined from ( [ eq : index_sm ] ) and ( [ eq : index_num ] ) .    for @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the distance travelled by the emitting region between 1992.07 and 1992.90 ( the 1st and the 7th spectral epochs ) should increase by a factor of @xmath44 . to assess the jet kinematics",
    ", we use @xmath45 measured in section [ sc : b3 ] for the jet component b3 at small separations from the core . for now , we assume that the jet bulk lorentz factor is @xmath46 , with the resulting doppler factor @xmath47 and jet viewing angle @xmath48 . using the time separation between the two aforementioned spectral epochs , @xmath49yrs , one can then estimate the distance between the emitting region and the jet apex , @xmath50pc .",
    "the case with @xmath40 results in @xmath51 , implying that the emitting region was accelerating .",
    "the corresponding turnover frequency evolution is described by @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting doppler factor must increase between @xmath53 and @xmath54 by @xmath55 , and the corresponding distance must become larger by a factor of @xmath56 . for a jet with variable doppler factor ,",
    "the distance travelled by the shock between two epochs @xmath53 and @xmath57 is ( lobanov & zensus 1998 ) : @xmath58 for the doppler factor @xmath32 , equation ( [ eq : travdistance ] ) gives for the distance to the jet apex at the epoch @xmath53 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the light speed , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the exact form of @xmath63 is essentially unknown . in many cases",
    ", it can be assumed to be constant ( so that the doppler factor variations are entirely due to a curved path followed by the emitting region ) . for a straight jet ,",
    "the @xmath63 can be derived from the doppler factor variations . for",
    ", both approaches yield similar result : @xmath64pc ( here we postulate @xmath65 ) .",
    "one can argue that the location @xmath66 ( the beginning of the adiabatic  loss stage ) should correspond to the vlbi core , since the core emission is likely to be dominated by compton and synchrotron energy losses ( unwin et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) , whereas the moving jet components are successfully modelled as adiabatically expanding spherical plasmons embedded in the jet ( zensus et al .",
    "1995 ) . in view of this argument",
    ", the case of a non  accelerating jet with @xmath67pc appears to be more likely to explain the observed spectral behavior in .",
    "if the jet core is located at @xmath66 , one can calculate the travel time between the jet nozzle , @xmath68 , and the core . for @xmath69 ( @xmath70const ) ,",
    "the calculation is trivial , and it gives ( in the observer s frame ) @xmath71yrs . for an accelerating jet , the travel time",
    "can be calculated from ( [ eq : travdistance ] ) , and it depends on the ( unknown ) doppler factor @xmath72 at the jet nozzle . if the nozzle is formed by a pressure drop in a relativistic outflow , the resulting lorentz factor is @xmath73 ( marscher 1980 ) .",
    "the corresponding doppler factor is then @xmath74 , for @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting travel time is @xmath76yrs . for larger",
    "@xmath77 , the travel time increases and may become as large as 2.8yrs , if @xmath78 .    on the basis of the arguments presented in the previous section , we take @xmath79yrs as a better estimate of the travel time between the nozzle and the core . in section [ sc : b3 ] ,",
    "we have found @xmath80 for the ejection time of the superluminal feature b3 . together with the derived nozzle  to  core travel time , this implies that the plasma condensation responsible for the emission of b3 had travelled through the nozzle at @xmath81 .",
    "the latter epoch is very close to the time when the optical flare was observed in the source .",
    "although the coincidence may be only fortuitous , it is rather striking , and we would like to emphasize that such a situation is indeed possible .",
    "for instance , if a flare occurs when a dense plasma condensation travels through the jet sonic point , the optical depth in the radio bands can exceed unity , and only a high  energy flare ( optical , x  rays , or gamma ",
    "rays ) is observed .",
    "an increase of the radio emission and the associated ejection of a new vlbi feature are observed later , after the condensation has travelled outside the @xmath82 region .",
    "the jet geometry and travel times above are determined for @xmath83 . if we suppose that the gamma - to - optical flaring activity and the ejection of vlbi component b3 in 1992 had a common origin , the jet geometry can be uniquely determined .",
    "we assume that the maximum of the flare occurs at @xmath84 and take @xmath85 from the extrapolation of the component motion .",
    "in such a scenario , @xmath86 , and we find @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding doppler factor is @xmath89 ; the core  to  nozzle distance is @xmath90pc .",
    "we note that the derived values are consistent with overall kinematics of ( o96 ) .",
    "we therefore view this model as a likely explanation for the kinematic properties , spectral behavior and flaring activity observed in in 19921993 .",
    "the kinematic parameters determined above for the case of a non  accelerating ( @xmath69 ) jet with transverse ( @xmath39 ) magnetic field can be further used to evaluate the physical conditions in the emitting region responsible for the observed spectral changes in . for this purpose , we associate the core  to  nozzle distance , @xmath91pc with the location of the emitting region at the estimated epoch of origin of b3 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "then , for each spectral epoch , we find the respective location , @xmath92 and size of the emitting region ( using equation ( 3 ) from marscher 1987 ) , @xmath93 @xmath94 and @xmath95 are measured at @xmath96 , which gives @xmath97ghz and @xmath98jy . for @xmath99 ,",
    "we use the size of the vlbi core , @xmath100mas , typically measured in the 22ghz images of .",
    "the corresponding linear size is @xmath101pc .",
    "the derived projected location and size of the emitting region are shown in figure [ fg : jetexp ] for all spectral epochs . the open square refers , in figure [ fg : jetexp ] , to the back - extrapolated ejection epoch of b3 ( associated with the passage of b3 through the vlbi core ) . at earlier epochs ,",
    "the emitting region was optically thick at frequencies @xmath102ghz , which is reflected in its negative location with respect to the vlbi core ( implying that the emitting region was traveling between the jet base and the vlbi core ) .",
    "the region was expanding almost linearly ; the resulting opening angle @xmath103 is in a good agreement with the observed opening angle measured in the immediate vicinity of the vlbi core ( o96 ) . during the expansion , the magnetic field decreases from @xmath104 g to @xmath105 g , with the core magnetic field , @xmath106 g .",
    "with the jet parameters determined , we can now discuss the energy balance in the compact jet of .",
    "we adopt the formulation of blandford and knigl ( 1979 ) to estimate the total ( kinetic@xmath107magnetic field ) power of the jet , @xmath108ergs@xmath109",
    ". the corresponding synchrotron power of the jet is @xmath110ergs@xmath109 . the data from von linde et al .",
    "( 1993 ) provide an estimate of the energy deposited in the jet by the optical flare , @xmath111erg .",
    "the maximum observed gamma luminosity of is @xmath112ergs@xmath109 ( mukherjee et al .",
    "1997 ) , but it should be made smaller by @xmath113@xmath114 to account for doppler boosting of the gamma - radiation . comparing the optical energy output and gamma luminosity to the jet radio power , we can conclude that flaring activity is not likely to play a significant role in forming and maintaining the jet . on the other hand",
    ", we find that the average isotropic luminosity of the optical flare is similar to the isotropic radio luminosity observed at the epoch of the flare ( @xmath115ergs@xmath109 ) , suggesting the relation between the emission in the two bands . in our view",
    ", this supports the schemes in which relativistic electrons ( responsible for synchrotron emission in the radio and optical bands ) are the primary radiating particles in the jet , and external photons ( producing the observed gamma - emission ) are compton scattered by the jet electrons ( e.g. blandford & levinson 1995 ) .",
    "then the energy densities of the synchrotron and compton emission can be related through the doppler factor , so that @xmath116 , ( dermer , sturner & schlickeiser 1997 )",
    ". we assume equipartition ( @xmath117 ) between the external radiation field and the magnetic field of the emitting region .",
    "then , for a typical spectral index of compton emission , @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 , which is consistent with the @xmath120 derived in section [ sc : travel ] .",
    "high frequency vlbi - observations performed shortly after a strong gamma / optical / radio outburst in the quasar revealed the ejection of a new jet component , which is moving at a constant apparent speed of @xmath121 . back ",
    "extrapolation of the motion yields a time of ejection of the component shortly ( @xmath122yrs ) after the time of the gamma-/optical flaring .",
    "the monitoring of the variations in total radio spectrum showed a synchrotron self - absorbed spectral component propagating from high to low frequencies .",
    "the path of the spectral turnover of this component , which we identify with the ejected jet component , is consistent with adiabatic expansion at a slope of @xmath123 .",
    "the time lag between the outburst and the observed component ejection can be quantitatively explained by strong synchrotron self ",
    "absorption at the jet base , which prevents the detection of the radio emission from the component at early epochs . in this model ,",
    "the jet radio - core is separated by @xmath124pc from the jet base .",
    "the jet plasma has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath125 , and moves at an angle of about 3@xmath126 to the line of sight .",
    "the corresponding jet opening angle derived from the expansion of the spectral component is @xmath127 .",
    "the derived values are consistent with the jet kinematic parameters obtained from vlbi monitoring of the source ( o96 ) .    the high gamma - ray luminosity ( figure [ fg : nufnu ] ) of , which surpasses the ir / optical luminosity by at least one order of magnitude",
    ", the rapid and apparently correlated variability seen in the gamma - ray and the optical regimes ( figure [ fg : lightcurves ] ) , and the ejection of a highly superluminal ( @xmath5 ) jet component after the quasi - simultaneous optical / gamma - ray flaring , strongly supports the idea that the gamma - emission originates in the inner parts of a highly relativistic jet and that a broad - band correlation  perhaps extending over the full electromagnetic spectrum  between high energy outbursts and ejection of new jet components exists .    the observed multi band energy output during and after the flare in 1992.1 allows us to conclude that the gamma and optical flaring activity are not sufficient to maintain the jet total power , but",
    "are connected with the observed jet radio emission . in this scheme ,",
    "relativistic electrons are responsible for synchrotron emission in the optical and radio bands , and external compton scattered photons produce the observed gamma radiation .",
