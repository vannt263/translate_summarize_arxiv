    "the interaction between mobile charge - carriers and magnetic impurities is accompanied by a spin - flip process . in superconductors",
    ", this process leads to the pair - breaking effect@xcite , that is , to the destruction of cooper pairs . as a result",
    ", superconducting properties are strongly affected by the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "for example , an increase of magnetic impurity concentration @xmath2 leads to the decrease of the critical temperature @xmath0 and to gaplesness@xcite , to a decrease of the critical field @xmath3 @xcite or the josephson current amplitude @xmath4 @xcite ( at given temperature ) .",
    "most studies including the effect of magnetic impurities consider the magnetic moments as independent from one another . because of the conservation of the total spin ( disregarding spin non - conserving couplings such as the dipole - dipole interaction )",
    "scattering processes involve the spin - flip of both the charge carrier and the localized magnetic moment .",
    "however , in the region near @xmath5 one should take into account the correlations between impurity spins .",
    "the ordering trend of the magnetic moments frustrates the spin - flip process and decreases , therefore , the pair breaking .",
    "this decrease leads to the `` recovery '' effect of superconductivity . as shown by two of the authors in ref .",
    "the account of this effect explains the unusual temperature dependence of @xmath3 in high - temperature superconductors and leads to excellent agreement with all experimental data available so far .",
    "the interplay of superconductivity and ordering of impurity spins has also been studied in the context of ternary compounds containing rare earth elements ( @xmath6rh@xmath1b@xmath1 with @xmath7sm , ho , er or lu@xcite ) . in some of these materials ( @xmath7sm ,",

    "anomalies in the josephson critical current have also been observed in this material.@xcite the experiment shows that the josephson amplitude is enhanced in the antiferromagnetic region as compared to the value extrapolated from the paramagnetic phase .    in the following ,",
    "we calculate the critical - current amplitude @xmath4 of a josephson junction in the presence of magnetic impurities and study the influence of the low - temperature ordering trend .",
    "our analysis shows that including impurity spin - spin correlations leads to a sizeable and experimentally observable increase of @xmath4 at low temperatures with respect to the saturated value obtained when neglecting these correlations",

    "the current depends on the temperature and on the concentration of magnetic impurities through @xmath19 .    in general ,",

    "( [ un ] ) , on @xmath27 appears not only through @xmath28 , but also through @xmath29 and is thus non - trivial . however , there are two limiting cases , that are of interest for the present work , in which an analytical expression can be derived .",
    "both are within the weak - coupling bcs theory ( @xmath30 ) . in the absence of magnetic impurities ( @xmath22 )",

    "this expression is usefull for the determination of @xmath4 at @xmath5 in the weak - coupling case . for strong - coupling superconductors one has to use eqs .",
    "( [ elimd ] ) and ( [ elimz ] ) .",
    "the numerical solution near @xmath5 can then be obtained using the poisson formula .",
    "the equations of the previous section describe the pair - breaking effect induced by the time - reversal non - invariant perturbation due to magnetic impurities .",
    "the theory accounts for such a perturbation through the spin - flip scattering amplitude @xmath36 ( see eq .",
    "( [ un ] ) ; @xmath37 is the relaxation time ) . in the usual picture of independent magnetic moments@xcite ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath24 is a temperature independent parameter .",
    "as already stressed in the introduction , the assumption of independent impurity spins is a good approximation at high temperatures and low impurity concentrations , but is not valid in the other cases .",
    "one example where the independent impurity - spin assumption is not valid is given by systems undergoing a magnetic phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the observed deviations from the expected behaviour of superconducting properties near and below the ( anti)ferromagnetic transition temperature of ternary compounds mentioned in the introduction point towards a change in the value of @xmath24 due to spin - spin correlations .",
    "we stress , however , that spin - spin correlations are important even if one does not observe a magnetic phase transition . for example , the formation of a spin `` glass '' is related to these correlations .",
    "the importance of magnetic impurity correlations increase with descreasing temperature .",
    "the anomal behaviour of the critical field @xmath3 observed in the cuprates can be explained by such correlations@xcite .",
    "another manifestation of such a `` recovery '' effect is the decrease in microwave losses @xcite observed under application of an external magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the frustration of the spin - flip process is due to the external field .    because of the spin - spin correlations ( the ordering trend of magnetic impurities ) the spin - flip scattering amplitude depends on temperature .",
    "this dependence @xmath38 was studied by two of the authors in ref .   and was applied to the evaluation of @xmath3 . according to this study , @xmath38 can be represented in the form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this expression is valid both for systems that do and do not undergo a magnetic phase transition . in the former case",
    "@xmath8 is the temperature of the phase transition and @xmath44 corresponds to the width of the critical region around @xmath8 ( it is such that @xmath45 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is no phase transition ( e.g. , when dealing with the formation of a spin `` glass '' ) , one sets @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the characteristic parameter of the ordering .",
    "the expression ( [ gamm ] ) introduced in ref .   describes the `` recovery '' effect in a phenomenological way ( a microscopic treatment will be presented elsewhere ) . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ gamm ] ) the spin - flip scattering amplitude is constant for @xmath48 ( or @xmath8 ) and decreases continuously near and below @xmath49 ( or @xmath8 ) .",
    "below @xmath50 the scattering amplitude @xmath24 is a constant independent of temperature .",
    "a change of only several percents of the value of @xmath38 at low temperatures can strongly affect the temperature dependencies of properties such as @xmath3 or @xmath51 ( see ref .   and below ) .",
    "generally speaking , the theory contains three parameters : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath47 . to determine their value one has to consider separateley the case of conventional and high-@xmath0 superconductors . in the first case ,",
    "the only existing experiments studying the effect of ordering on pair - breaking were done on systems that are ( anti)ferromagnetically ordered . a reasonable value for the characteristic temperature @xmath47 is thus given by the critical temperature of the phase transition which is of the order of 1k .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath54 can be obtained within the abrikosov - gorkov theory , once the experimental value of the critical temperature @xmath0 in the presence of magnetic impurities is given .",
    "its value corresponds to the high - temperature limit of the spin - flip scattering amplitude ( when @xmath55 ) .",
    "we are thus left with one free parameter .    in the case of high - temperature superconductors the analysis of @xmath3 performed in ref",
    ".   delivers the values for all parameters .",
    "there is thus no free parameter left for the high-@xmath0 materials studied in ref .  .",
    "for example , for overdoped tl@xmath56ba@xmath56cuo@xmath57 studied experimentally in ref .",
    "one has @xmath58k , @xmath59 , @xmath60k , whereas for bi@xmath56sr@xmath56cuo@xmath57 studied in ref .",
    "one has @xmath61k , @xmath62 and @xmath63k .",
    "based on eqs .",
    "( [ elimd])-([jc ] ) and ( [ gamm ] ) we can calculate the amplitude of the josephson critical current in the presence of magnetic - impurity ordering at low temperatures .",
    "we consider the weak and strong coupling cases separately .",
    "since , to our knowledge , no experimental study of the ordering trend on @xmath51 has been undertaken either on conventional or high - temperature superconductors for systems that do not undergo a magnetic phase transistion , we chose arbitrary but realistic values of the parameters and discuss qualitatively what can be expected for the two types of superconductors .",
    "for a weak - coupling superconductor @xmath64 , @xmath65 and one neglects the dependence on @xmath66 of @xmath67 .",
    "( [ elimd])-([un ] ) reduce to the abrikosov - gorkov theory@xcite . for the numerical calculations we determine @xmath13 and @xmath24 from the experimental values of @xmath0 and @xmath68 ( the critical temperature with and without magnetic impurities ) .",
    "@xmath13 is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ elimd])-([un ] ) for @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath69 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath54 can be extracted from the abrikosov - gorkov equation for @xmath0 in the presence of magnetic impurities @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the pair - breaking parameter and @xmath72 is the psi function .    fig .",
    "1 shows the temperature dependence of the josephson amplitude for different concentrations of magnetic impurities , that is for different values of @xmath52 .",
    "the temperature and amplitude of the current are normalized to the critical temperature @xmath68 and the amplitude @xmath73 [ see eq .",
    "( [ jcab ] ) ] in the absence of magnetic impurities , respectively .",
    "as seen in the figure , the presence of magnetic impurities lowers the value of @xmath0 and @xmath51 with respect to the ambegaokar - baratoff result .",
    "as stated in the introduction this is a consequence of the pair - breaking effect .",
    "one notes further that @xmath51 does not saturate as @xmath33 but increase in a temperature range given by @xmath47 .",
    "the upturn is the direct signature of the impurity - spin ordering trend , that is , the temperature dependency of the spin - flip scattering amplitude .",
    "there is a `` recovery '' effect due to impurity - spin ordering opposing the saturation trend of @xmath4 for uncorrelated spins .",
    "note that the recovery is not complete [ @xmath74 since @xmath75 .",
    "this is even true for a fully ordered state .",
    "the mechanisms impeding the total recovery of the ambegaokar - baratoff result ( as , e.g. , dipole - dipole interactions ; see also ref .  ) will be described elswhere .",
    "the ordering trend of local moments leads to a positive curvature of @xmath51 at low temperatures .",
    "1 shows that , the high - temperature linear part becomes dominant as one increases the concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "the account of correlations leads thus to a behaviour of @xmath51 that is qualitatively different from the result obtained for @xmath9@xcite .",
    "indeed , in the absence of spin correlations , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , considered as functions of temperature , both have a negative curvature up to @xmath0 and are linear in the vicinity of @xmath0 . adding magnetic impurities",
    "extends the high - temperature linear part of @xmath76 to lower temperatures to the expens of the low - temperature region ( that has positive curvature if impurity correlations are taken into account ; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the effect on @xmath9 is opposite .",
    "for high enough magnetic impurity concentrations , @xmath9 displays a positive curvature over the whole temperature range when correlations are taken into account@xcite .",
    "the concentration of magnetic impurities at which a positive curvature of @xmath3 was observed experimentally corresponds to the case @xmath77 of fig .  1 ( i.e.  to the gapless regime ) .    fig .",
    "2 gives another representation of the situation presented in fig .",
    "compare first the solid and dashed lines .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the case @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( same parameters as the dotted line of figure 1 ) whereas the solid line corresponds to the case of uncorrelated spins and @xmath81 .",
    "the latter value was chosen in such a way that the critical temperature @xmath0 is the same for both curves .",
    "one can see that the result obtained by taking into account the correlation of impurity spins strongly deviates from the curve expected when the spins are uncorrelated .",
    "this deviation is already significant at temperatures near @xmath0 for high enough impurity concentrations , but is largest near @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the deviation is such that it should be experimentally observable .",
    "another conclusion can be drawn when comparing the dashed and dotted lines of fig .  2 .",
    "these curves were obtained for different values of the parameter @xmath53 [ see eq .",
    "( [ gamm ] ) ] .",
    "thus , both curves include the spin - correlations of the magnetic impurities , but the strength of the correlations is different .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath82 whereas the dotted line is for @xmath83 . because @xmath52 remained unchanged , the two curves have slightly different @xmath0 s .",
    "the increase of @xmath53 , which corresponds to an increase of the influence of magnetic - impurity correlations , implies a stronger temperature dependency of @xmath51 .",
    "2 shows that impurity correlations reduce the high and intermediaire temperature negative curvature of @xmath51 .",
    "note , finally , that the value at @xmath5 is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "it would be interesting to study experimentally the same high - temperature superconductors as those for which @xmath3 was measured and described in ref .  .",
    "indeed , the values of the parameter for the expression of @xmath38 are given by the analysis of @xmath9 , leaving no free parameter ( see previous section ) .",
    "of special interest would be the case of yba@xmath56(cu@xmath84zn@xmath85)@xmath86o@xmath87 since there are evidences that the depression of @xmath0 and other superconducting properties is mainly due to the increase in magnetic impurity concentration ( see also section on strong - coupling superconductors ) .",
    "note , finally , that our calculations suggest a possible application of josephson junctions based on superconductors doped with magnetic impurities ( as e.g. high-@xmath0 materials ) .",
    "indeed , because the temperature dependence of the josephson current is linear for superconductors in the gapless regime ( see dash - dotted line of fig .  1 ) , the measure of @xmath51 for such systems can be used as a thermometer@xcite .",
    "up to now we have assumed that the magnetic moments are correlated but remain disordered . in the case of a magnetic phase transition ,",
    "the result differs from above in that the temperature dependency of @xmath24 vanishes below @xmath8 [ see eq .",
    "( [ gamm ] ) ] .",
    "this is shown on fig .  3 for parameters corresponding to the experimental results on smrh@xmath1b@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the critical temperature in the absence of magnetic impurities is set to @xmath88k , the value of @xmath68 for lurh@xmath1b@xmath1 which has the same structure as the sm compound , is also superconducting but has no magnetic moments .",
    "the values @xmath89k , @xmath90k , @xmath91k were taken from the experiment@xcite .",
    "the value @xmath92k was determined from the measure of @xmath93 .",
    "finally , the remaining parameter @xmath94 was fixed by the value @xmath54 chosen in such a way that @xmath95k from eqs .",
    "( [ gamm ] ) and ( [ tcag ] ) .",
    "the values of all parameters have thus been taken from the experiment and there is no free fitting parameter left .",
    "regarding the determination of these parameters , one notes first that we are in the gapless regime ( @xmath96 ) and thus in the situation of the dash - dotted curve of fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath53 that arises because of the spin - spin correlations is close to one ( value at which the spins are uncorrelated ) and thus much smaller than most of the high-@xmath0 superconductors studied in ref .",
    "( which are of the order @xmath97 ) .    comparing our result with the experiment on the ternary compound , one notes that the behaviour above the temperature @xmath50 ( at which the transition to the antiferromagnetic state is complete ) is well reproduced by our calculation .",
    "this demonstrates that the increase of the current observed near @xmath50 in ref .",
    "can indeed be explained by the ordering trend of the magnetic impurities . below @xmath50 , however , the situation is less clear .",
    "if we use eq .",
    "( [ gamm ] ) then we observe a distinct discrepancy between experiment and theory . in the experiment , the current continues to increase as @xmath98 is lowered , whereas the current saturates in our calculation ( see dashed line below @xmath50 in fig .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that in metallic systems containing magnetic impurities several processes occur that were not accounted for in the present analysis .",
    "one of them is connected with symmetry breaking caused by the impurity@xcite .",
    "another reason for the discrepancy is related to the direct dipole - dipole or rkky type interaction between the impurity spins . in the specific case studied in ref .",
    ", the occurence of a proximity effect due to unoxidized parts of the lu layer of the junction may also be responsible for the linear behaviour of @xmath51 for @xmath99 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "further experimental studies should be carried out on this system to determine which mechanism is the most relevant to explain the data .    to take into account the additional temperature dependence of the spin - spin correlations induced by the above processes , we have considered a temperature dependent @xmath24 below @xmath50 as well , but with modified values of the parameters .",
    "the experimental value @xmath100 gives @xmath101 , @xmath47 is kept unchanged and @xmath102 gives the best fit to the data . as seen on fig .",
    "3 ( solid line ) , the temperature dependence of @xmath24 below @xmath50 can account well for the experimental result .",
    "this is not a trivial statement because , as shown in the previous figures , the temperature dependency @xmath51 can not be modified at ease by changing the values of the parameter .",
    "the fact that one has to include a temperature dependency of @xmath24 in the antiferromagnetic region leads us to the conclusion that not only the contact interaction but also the other mechanisms ( see above and ref .  )",
    "are important in this material .",
    "we study the influence of strong coupling onto the results of the last section .",
    "this case is numerically more difficult to handle , due to the fact that the renormalization function has to be considered and that all three unknown functions @xmath29 , @xmath103 and @xmath19 depend on @xmath27 .",
    "as before , we determine @xmath24 and @xmath13 from the equations for @xmath0 and @xmath68 . for @xmath0 one",
    "linearizes eq .",
    "( [ elimd ] ) . as for @xmath68 ( @xmath22 )",
    "we use the expression derived by one of the authors@xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath12 is the characteristic phonon frequency .",
    "4 shows a generic case for the strong coupling limit .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between the weak and strong coupling results .",
    "the parameters in fig .",
    "4 were chosen so as to correspond to the case of yba@xmath56(cu@xmath84zn@xmath85)@xmath86o@xmath87 with @xmath105 ( @xmath106k)@xcite@xmath107 . this result leads us to conclude that the overall qualitative behaviour obtained for weak - coupling superconductors is not modified by increasing the strength of the coupling .",
    "in particular , one expects a nearly linear behaviour of @xmath51 for high-@xmath0 materials where @xmath0 has been strongly reduced by the presence of magnetic impurities and are in the gapless regime .",
    "examples of such systems are zn - doped yba@xmath56cu@xmath86o@xmath87@xcite@xmath107 and la@xmath108sr@xmath109cuo@xmath1@xcite@xmath110 , as well as other under- and overdoped materials studied in ref .",

    "in summary , we have calculated the amplitude of the josephson current @xmath51 in the presence of magnetic impurities taking into account their ordering trend at low temperatures .",
    "we have shown that the `` recovery '' effect introduced in ref .",
    "is also occuring for the josephson current @xmath51 .",
    "the effect manifests itself in an upturn of @xmath51 at low temperatures ( instead of the saturation occuring for uncorrelated magnetic moments ) .",
