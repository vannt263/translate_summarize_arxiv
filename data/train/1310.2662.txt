    "an experiment was conducted to study the bouncing behavior of silicone oil drops on a vertically oscillating shallow tray of the same liquid .",
    "the simple bouncing , period - doubled bouncing and walking regimes as well as chaotic and intermittent behaviors were observed and occurred under conditions very similar to those of previous work  @xcite .",
    "the influence of depth on the trajectories of drops walking over a submerged obstacle was investigated . the local change of depth associated with the obstacle led to a range of possible trajectories , including straight crossing , reflection from the aft face of the obstacle and trapping of the droplet above the obstacle .",
    "a reduction in walking velocity occurred in all cases .",
    "the different behaviors were dependent on the approach velocity of the drops ; the change of depth influenced the decay time of the standing waves generated during bouncing , thus producing changes to the walking speed and direction .",
    "a circular aluminum tray of 6 inches in diameter was filled with silicone oil ( _ clearco _",
    "psf-50cst ) and mounted on a vibration exciter .",
    "the depth of the oil film was greater than 4 mm so that the faraday waves were independent of this parameter .",
    "an accelerometer was installed on the side of the tray to measure the amplitude and frequency of motion .",
    "the influence of a local change in depth was studied by gluing a submerged obstacle , namely an aluminum strip with height @xmath0 mm , width @xmath1 mm and length 120 mm , to the bottom of the tray along its diameter . in order to ensure that the drops would walk toward the obstacle ,",
    "two guides were placed forming a triangular shape with the obstacle  @xcite .",
    "the height of these guides exceeded the maximum depth of the oil so that drops would reflect off them if they got close .",
    "the tray was filled with silicone oil until the surface was 2 mm above the obstacle , @xmath2 mm    to create drops of the desired size , a needle or a sharp toothpick ( @xmath3 mm in diameter ) was plunged inside the oil tray and rapidly pulled out . when the resultant liquid ligament detached from the surface , it either produced one small droplet or a set of droplets with distributed sizes via the plateau - rayleigh instability , depending on the rate at which the liquid bridge was elongated .",
    "this technique produced small drops ( generally @xmath4 mm ) .",
