    "the outflow of stellar winds from massive ob - type stars is an important process which affects both the chemical enrichment and kinetics of the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mass - loss itself is enough to change the evolution of the star , which ends its life in a supernova explosion , also profoundly changing its environment .",
    "hence , quantitative understanding massive star winds is important not only as a basic component of stellar astrophysics , but also for understanding cosmic feedback on galactic scales throughout cosmic history .    while some basic physics of stellar winds in massive stars is well established  that winds are accelerated by photoelectric absorption of the intense ultraviolet radiation field by a multitude of metal lines , that an instability can lead to wind - shocks which generate x - rays  there are still puzzles to be solved .",
    "one of these is the `` weak - wind '' problem , in which uv line diagnostics clearly show a wind signature in classical p  cygni line profiles , but modeled mass loss rates can be discrepant by more than an order of magnitude from values expected based on o - star statistical trends and theoretical foundations , specifically the wind momentum - luminosity relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "factors of a few in mass loss are enough to be significant for stellar evolution and cosmic feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has long been known that photoionization by x - rays can alter the ionization balance in the wind regions where the uv lines are formed @xcite .",
    "there is a theoretical degeneracy in that different values of mass loss rate ( @xmath1 ) and x - ray luminosity ( @xmath2 ) can produce very similar uv line profiles @xcite ; direct knowledge of the x - ray spectrum is thus important for reliable determination of wind parameters .",
    "another possibility is that cool and hot plasma emission originate from different volumes or densities ; that is , clumping can affect the interpretation @xcite .",
    "@xmath0colbelongs to the weak - wind domain defined by @xcite in which a star s rate of mechanical energy loss in a radiatively driven wind is less than the radiative output from nuclear burning ; lucy showed that there is a huge disparity between the theoretically expected @xmath1 and values derived from uv and optical spectra .",
    "@xcite developed a phenomenological model and suggested that in low - luminosity o - type stars , the volumetric roles of hot and cool gas are possibly reversed compared to o - type stars of high luminosity ; thus in the weak - wind stars , a larger volume is occupied by the hot gas than by the cool gas .",
    "@xmath0col(hd  38666 ) is an o9.5  v runaway ( and single ) star and is one of the weakest wind galactic o - type stars ( e.g. , see figs .  39 and 41 in * ? ? ?",
    "these factors are what motivated our spectroscopic study of the prototypical weak - wind system , @xmath0col , at high - resolution with _ chandra_and at low resolution but greater sensitivity at higher energies with _ suzaku_. in this letter , we concentrate on the primary empirical results from the x - ray spectral analysis of @xmath0col",

    "emission line strengths are indicative of plasma temperatures and elemental abundances .",
    "the continuum at the shortest wavelengths available ( @xmath36@xmath37 , @xmath38@xmath39 ) is also very sensitive to the highest temperatures present .",
    "the he - like triplets are sensitive to electron density and the uv radiation field through collisional and photoelectric excitation which can depopulate the forbidden - line level , weakening it while strengthening the intercombination lines @xcite ; in o - stars , the uv field typically dominates the depopulation and hence he - like line ratios are diagnostic of radius of formation @xcite . very close to the photosphere , density effects could also become significant .",
    "we have fit a global model to the x - ray spectrum , using standard products produced by ciao ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , and associated calibration database ) , using isis @xcite and the collisional ionization equilibrium emissivities in atomdb ( version 2.0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the plasma model",
    ", we used a broken powerlaw emission measure distribution ( emd ; which in differential form is defined as @xmath40 ) , with variable abundances for significant ions , a doppler shift , and line profiles defined by a global gaussian doppler broadening term .",
    "our models show that the absorption of x - rays in the cool stellar wind is negligible , and spectra can be well fitted neglecting wind absorption .",
    "abundances , velocity , and broadening were common over all temperature components .",
    "the resulting fit is shown as the red curve in figure  [ fig : mucolspec ] .",
    "the emission measure distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : emd ] .",

    "abundances ( referenced to solar photospheric values of @xcite ) were about half of solar ( o , si , and fe ) or near solar ( n , ne)we could not obtain a good fit using abundances all set to solar .",
    "this may be due to the adopted smooth functional form of the emission measure distribution , since the emd and abundances are somewhat degenerate .",
    "trial fits with discrete temperature components were also poorer when using solar abundances . to explore this",
    "somewhat further , since the integrated emission measure is fundamental to our main result , we evaluated the 90% confidence limits of the model normalization , froze this at each of the high and low limits , and re - fit the spectrum to obtain new emd and abundances .",
    "we could have half the integrated em with relative abundances increased to 0.71.5 , or we could have about triple the best - fit em , also with slightly modified abundances .",
    "( we note that from uv spectra , @xcite also found low abundances for @xmath0col , but did not believe their results plausible and attributed them to model deficiencies . )    the broken powerlaw model is empirically justified in that it provides a necessary multi - thermal model and does fit well with relatively few parameters .",
    "such an emd can be physically justified by hydrodynamic shock models which predict a wide range of temperatures over a large range of radii @xcite .",
    "other ob - stars have also shown similar , empirically determined emd @xcite .",
    "the important point here is to obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate of the em , and that can be done with a variety of plausible models . also given that the x - ray emitting plasma is optically thin , it does not matter ( for the emd ) where the emission originates , under the assumption that abundances are independent of temperature and density .",

    "we used an un - clumped model profile with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we find the wind is thin enough that a small asymmetry and shift is due to the stellar disk occultation of the receding hot wind .",

    "the intercombination lines are as strong as the resonance lines .",
    "the forbidden - to - intercombination ratios ( @xmath61 ) provide limits on the radii of formation .",
    "we applied a simple model assuming triplet formation occurs at a single radius in the wind , using only excitation by photospheric uv fluxes from model atmospheres such as tlusty or atlas-9 @xcite .",
    "we also used more sophisticated treatment using the powr code @xcite in which the wind model calculates ionization structure , solves the energy equation , includes x - rays , includes photospheric emission corrected for absorption lines , line blanketing , non - lte populations , stellar disk limb darkening , and the diffuse uv radiation field .",
    "each of the methods predicts the @xmath61-ratio vs radius @xmath62 of formation .",
    "values ( which were nearly identical for all methods ) are given in table  [ tbl : props ] with @xmath62 , in units of the stellar radius .",
    "there is some temperature dependence in the triplet ratios , but it is below 10% , less than our measurement uncertainty .",
    "the point - formation model also ignores the effect of any distributed emission .",
    "if there is contribution from further out in the wind , our @xmath61-derived radii will be overestimates ( since @xmath63 increases and @xmath64 decreases at larger radii",
    " the distributed emission ratio would be larger than at any point at smaller radius ) .",
    "we have also looked for variability .",
    "the count rate in dispersed photons appears constant ; the rate cannnot change by more than 510% in time intervals of 1 ks or more .",
    "the he - like triplets place the x - ray emission within about 25 stellar radii of the photosphere .",
    "line widths are consistent with x - rays being formed at small radii .",
    "we assume that the hot plasma obeys the continuity equation , that the standard velocity law holds for the hot plasma , namely @xmath65 , and that the hot plasma exists only above some inner radius @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( a value based on the ratio of the sound speed at @xmath69 to @xmath52 , which provides a non - zero wind velocity , but which is somewhat uncertain . ) and @xmath70 , we expect wind velocities in this region to be about 8001300@xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mucollines ] shows the widths to be somewhat smaller at 300700@xmath71 .",
    "this suggests that much of the x - ray emission originates very close to the star within the radiation - driven wind acceleration zone , or that the hot plasma does not follow the typical velocity law .",
    "the hot plasma , however , does expand with relatively high velocity since the x - ray emission line profiles are resolved .",
    "detailed line - profile fitting using wind - models will be required to determine the structure in more detail .    with the assumptions above and the definition of the x - ray emission measure ( and @xmath57 to allow an analytic integration )",
    ", we can derive a simple expression for the x - ray inferred mass loss rate in solar masses per year , also assuming that the hot wind is unclumped , and that the cool wind is optically thin to x - rays ( as justified by the line profiles ) : @xmath72^{1/2}\\ ] ] in which @xmath73 is the hot wind s terminal velocity as determined from x - ray emission line profiles ( in units of @xmath74 ) , @xmath69 is the stellar radius , @xmath41 is the emission measure of the hot plasma ( in units of @xmath75 ) , and @xmath76 is the unitless parameter from the wind velocity law . using @xmath77 , @xmath78 and values from table  [ tbl : props ] , we infer that @xmath79 .",
    "this is 6 times the value derived from the uv by @xcite ( or more , accounting for subsequent revisions in distance and stellar radius ) .",
    "if the hot wind begins somewhere above the photosphere , then the inferred mass loss rate will be even larger ( e.g. , about 20 times for @xmath80 ) .",
    "the above @xmath81 uses our @xmath82 .",
    "if were to assume the much lower @xmath83 , we would infer a much smaller emission measure for a spherically symmetric wind .",
    "this means that most of the wind is hot ( or denser ) than the uv - emitting plasma , a situation also noticed in the study of main sequence b stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the hot wind of @xmath84  col must have a larger volume or greater density than the cool wind .",
    "the wind is not weak , but it is hot and its bulk is only detectable in x - rays .",
    "our observations exclude other proposed weak - wind explanations , such as magnetically channeled wind shocks ( mcws ) or frictionally decoupled winds .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0colis not characteristic of mcws in which hot plasma is held in stationary structures close to the stellar photosphere and which reach high temperatures from collision of funneled high velocity winds @xcite .",
    "the plasma of @xmath0colis not extremely hot ( @xmath85 ) nor are lines unshifted and unresolved .",
    "decoupling of ions from neutrals could occur at low densities or very low metallicities , creating a two - fluid system .",
    "frictional heating by decoupled ions seems unlikely : the plasma is not extremely cool ( @xmath86 ) with different widths and velocities for different ions ( within our sensitivity ; fig .",
    "[ fig : mucollines ] ) . given the x - ray @xmath41 and likely radii of formation , the density is not as low as once presumed .",
    "the relative fe abundance from our fits is about 0.5 solar , not low enough to cause decoupling .",
    "@xcite reduced the weak - wind discrepancy through theoretical arguments .",
    "the x - ray spectra of @xmath0colsupport this with empirical evidence for a dominant hot wind , even given some uncertainty from still poorly determined factors of clumping , wind velocity law , and location of the wind base .",
    "@xcite suggested that x - rays may increase the wind ionization at the critical point , lowering the effective radiative acceleration and mass - loss rate .",
    "our _ chandra_observations resolve the broad x - ray emission lines , indicating that the hot plasma expands at high velocities , perhaps even exceeding the cool wind velocity determined from uv spectra .",
    "our empirical findings , reached in ignorance of work by @xcite , are in line with his claim that in late - type o - dwarfs the ambient wind is heated to temperatures of few mk at radii @xmath87 , with cool radiatively - driven gas being confined to dense clumps and small volume filling factor . further out in the wind in his model , cool clumps are destroyed by heat conduction from the hot plasma , and the outflow is dominated by a hot thermal wind which reaches a supersonic terminal velocity of @xmath88 .    in future work",
    ", we will refine our order - of - magnitude estimates using detailed wind models .",
    "for a relatively thin wind , we do not expect significant qualitative changes .",
    "some observational uncertainties need to be refined : we only have both upper and lower limits for the formation radii of ne  ; whether other species form at @xmath89 or below @xmath90 is important for wind shock models .",
    "higher spectral resolution would be of use , especially for the hottest he - like triplet in the spectrum , si  , to probe the deepest layers .",
    "higher resolution would better determine line shifts and widths , and better constrain wind structure .",
    "@xcite recently classified @xmath91oriab ( hd  37468 , o9.5  v  +  b0.5  v ) as a weak - wind system , based on infrared spectra , revising its mass - loss rate downward by more than two orders of magnitude from that in @xcite .",
    "this star has also been observed at high resolution in x - rays @xcite .",
    "based on these prior works and our own analysis of the _ chandra_/hetgspectrum , we find that @xmath91orihas x - ray spectral characteristics very similar to those of @xmath0col .",
    "this further corroborates our conclusions that the weak - wind phenomenon is due to a property of the cool plasma being a minor constituent of the wind .",
    "our results challenge the idea that some ob stars are `` weak - wind '' stars that deviate from the standard wind - luminosity relationship . from high - resolution x - ray spectrum of @xmath0col , specifically he - like lines and the total emission measure , this star does not appear unusual relative to other o - stars except for its weak - wind status .",
    "its x - ray emission measure , line widths , and centroids are in good agreement with the ob main sequence star results of @xcite .",
    "the volume emission measure of the x - ray emitting plasma must be very much larger than the cool , uv - emitting plasma , and we believe that the weak - wind problem is reduced or eliminated when the hot and dominant component of the wind is taken into account .",
