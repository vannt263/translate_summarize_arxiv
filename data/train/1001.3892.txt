    "the o - type star herschel  36 ( her36 ) is located in the m8 nebula , a high - mass star - forming region at a distance of 1.3  kpc ( arias et al .",
    "this o7.5v(n ) star ( walborn 1982 ) is responsible for the ionization of the optically brightest part of m8 , known as the hourglass nebula .",
    "a very young infrared cluster is found around her36 ( arias et al .",
    "the ultracompact hii region g5.97 - 1.17 , a candidate `` proplyd '' similar to those seen in the orion nebula ( stecklum et al .",
    "1998 ) , is located @xmath1 distant from her36 .",
    "recently , high - resolution infrared imaging of the region also revealed the existence of a compact source at @xmath2 southeast of the star , which harbors an early b - type embedded star ( goto et al .",
    "her36 and its close neighbors are probably part of a trapezium - like stellar system .",
    "it seems clear that most , or even all , massive stars form in clusters and ob associations ( de wit et al .",
    "after a few hundred thousand years , they become optically visible . only few , if any , of the massive stars are found as single objects and , on average , massive stars have more than one companion . ignoring the multiplicity of massive stars can introduce serious problems when comparing observations and stellar evolution theory .",
    "although it is often stated that zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) o stars should not be and are not observed optically , her36 appears as a possible bona fide zams o star ( walborn 2007 ) , based on the appearance of its optical spectrum , the association with a dense , dusty nebular knot and its observed subluminosity ( arias et al . 2006 ) . because of all these aspects , her36 and the hourglass have been many times compared to @xmath3  ori  c and the orion trapezium .",
    "her36 has also been extensively studied because it shows an `` anomalous '' extinction curve with @xmath4 ( arias et al .",
    "2006 ) , which represents one of the highest @xmath5 values known ( cf . fitzpatrick & massa 2009 ) .",
    "a long - term spectroscopic monitoring of galactic o and wolf - rayet of the nitrogen sequence ( wn ) stars is being carried out ( gamen et al . 2008 ) , with the main aim of establishing the multiplicity status of these objects . as part of this observational campaign , her36 has been systematically observed .",
    "here we present the results of the analysis of the data , which demonstrate conclusively that her36 is a complex multiple system , with outstanding characteristics .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] presents the journal of the observations used in this work .",
    "most of them came from the monitoring campaign of galactic o and wn stars and were obtained between 2005 april and 2009 may at the observatories of las campanas ( lco ) and la silla , in chile .",
    "a total of 33 high - resolution spectra were obtained at lco ; 32 of those were taken with the chelle spectrograph at the 2.5 m du pont telescope and the other with the mike at the 6.5 m magellan ii ( clay ) telescope .",
    "twenty - six more spectra were acquired with feros at eso la silla .",
    "four additional spectra were taken at the complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) , argentina , in observing runs prior to 2005 , using the reosc sel cassegrain spectrograph in cross - dispersion mode .",
    "technical details of the observations and data reduction are presented by r. h. barb et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "besides the balmer series , the spectrum of her36 shows many absorption lines characteristic of hot massive stars , such as those of hei , heii , ciii and iv , oiii and siiv .",
    "some diffuse interstellar bands at 4430 , 4500 , 5780 , and 5797 , as well as a number of interstellar absorption lines due to caii and nai , are also evident . narrow strong nebular emission lines , associated with the hourglass nebula , are observed , some of them superimposed on the balmer and hei absorptions .",
    "the spectrum of her36 was monitored during two to six consecutive nights in each of the observing runs .",
    "the first result that came from the inspection of our high - resolution data is that the spectrum of this star is highly variable .",
    "the spectral lines of her36 show large variations in both line - profile shape and radial velocity ( rv ) , on a timescale of hours . even if all the absorption lines appear appreciably broadened , in good agreement with the qualifier ( n ) in the spectral classification by walborn ( 1982 ) , the profiles of the most prominent ones alternate between more or less normal and unusually broad .",
    "when observed with enough resolution , the lines are clearly not single : at different times and in different lines , one , two , or three components are detected , showing that this star is actually a multiple system .",
    "we present the variations in the heii  @xmath64686 line in the left panel of figure  [ reg4600 ] .",
    "this plot includes the data from five consecutive nights .",
    "the morphology observed varies from a very deep single profile to a well - defined double line . at first sight , however , the line - profile morphology does not seem to be strictly repeatable .",
    "large rv variations accompany all these changes .",
    "we will refer to the main and secondary absorptions as `` component a '' and `` component b1 '' , respectively .",
    "an even more complex behavior is observed in the hei absorption lines .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ reg4600 ] shows the spectral variations in the hei @xmath65875 line .",
    "now three absorption components ( labeled as a , b1 , and b2 ) can be clearly identified . whereas components a and b1 correlate with those observed in the heii  @xmath64686 profile , the component b2 is undetected in the heii lines , indicating that the latter star is cooler than its companions .",
    "the rv of the main component a changes rather slowly , but the variations observed for components b1 and b2 are remarkably large .",
    "note that the positions of the components b1 and b2 practically invert from the forth to the fifth night .",
    "apart from the heii  @xmath64686 and hei  @xmath65875 lines , several other photospheric features , such as hei  @xmath64471 , heii  @xmath65411 , ciii  @xmath64650 , and civ  @xmath65812 , were also measured .",
    "we found correlated variations in profile shape and rv in most of these lines .",
    "finally , we considered the least blended spectra in order to obtain a spectral type for each of the three stellar components detected in the spectrum of her36 .",
    "the spectral classification was performed by comparison of the spectrum with the ob star atlas of walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) .",
    "we adopt the spectral types o7.5v , o9v , and b0.5v for components a , b1 , and b2 , respectively .",
    "the fact that all measured photospheric lines show similar profile and rv variations suggests that the rv variations detected in the spectrum of her36 are actually caused by the orbital motion of , at least , three stellar components .",
    "we propose that the system is composed of a close o - type binary and a third more distant companion , also of spectral type o. the binary and the third body are very likely in wide orbit about each other .      the behavior observed in the hei  @xmath65875 line suggests that the components b1 and b2 are constituents of a double - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "when we refer to this binary system we will simply use the term `` system b '' .    as mentioned before",
    ", the component b2 is not detected in heii .",
    "moreover , only in the hei  @xmath65875 line , the profile features appear separated enough to obtain a reliable measurement of the rv of each component .",
    "thus we considered only this line to determine the orbital solution for the stellar system b. the rv measurements used in the determination of the orbital solution are presented in table  [ tbl-1 ] ( columns 6 and 7 ) .",
    "we determined the rvs of the different components of the hei @xmath65875 line by fitting them with adequate sums of gaussian profiles . to do this",
    ", we considered four gaussian functions : one for each of the stellar components a , b1 , and b2 , as well as an additional one to take into account the strong nebular emission .",
    "first , we used the least blended spectra to determine the intensities and widths of the three stellar blends and then repeated the disentangling by keeping these parameters fixed .",
    "thus the deconvolution of gaussian profiles yielded the central wavelengths of the four components ( three stellar and one nebular ) of the hei  @xmath65875 line as adjusted parameters . in spite of the complexity of this blend ,",
    "the fits were highly satisfactory in most of the cases .",
    "being conservative , we estimate that the measurement errors in the rvs of the stellar components are no larger than 10  kms@xmath7 .",

    "to study the spectral variations , we used the rv measurements of the heii  @xmath64686 line .",
    "this line appears as one of the most useful features for investigating possible periodicities because of being less contaminated by other features or the background nebular emission , and , mainly , because of showing only two stellar components : a and b1 . as in the case of the hei  @xmath65875 line",

    "an additional value of @xmath33 days is also strong but less significant , and can not be discarded a priori .",

    "it can be verified that , within the errors , both solutions represent essentially the same orbit .",
    "the main finding of this study is the multiple nature of the zams object her36 .",
    "the absorption lines in the spectrum of this star are clearly not single .",
    "we arrived at the conclusion that her36 presents at least three stellar components that we labeled as a , b1 , and b2 , and classified as o7.5v , o9v , and b0.5v , respectively .",
    "arias et al .",
    "( 2006 ) determined the distance and reddening to several early - type stars in the hourglass region , including her36 .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , her36 that was considered as a single o7.5v star in their calculus fell below the calibration of its luminosity class .",
    "the here demonstrated multiplicity of her36 makes the stars that compose this triple system even much more subluminous individually .",
    "thus , if we adopt the absolute magnitudes for zams ob stars from hanson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the combined @xmath34 value obtained is similar to that quoted by arias et al .",
    "this fact adds additional support to the hypothesis that the stellar components of this system may be on the zams .",
    "we measured the most prominent features in the spectrum of her36 , finding correlated variations in profile shape and rv . based on our rv study",
    ", we proposed that her36 is composed of a close massive binary , the stellar pair b1+b2 ( system b ) , and a companion , the component a , which is the most luminous star of the system and dominates the optical spectrum .",
    "considering the rv measurements of the hei  @xmath65875 line , we derived a set of orbital elements for the system b. the best solution is characterized by a circular orbit with a period @xmath35 days , and semi - amplitudes @xmath36  kms@xmath7 and @xmath37  kms@xmath7 .",
    "we can use the obtained minimum masses @xmath38 to estimate the inclination of the system b. the values of 14.6 and 9.0  m@xmath26 , derived for the primary and the secondary , respectively , are compared with the typical masses of o9v and b0.5v stars . according to the values for detached eclipsing systems from gies ( 2003 ) ( 19.0  m@xmath26 for o9v and 11.7  m@xmath26 for b0.3v )",
    ", the system must have a large inclination ( larger than 67@xmath39 ) , which means that it could possibly undergo eclipses .",
    "unfortunately , no photometric study of her  36 exists at present .",
    "future photometric monitoring will certainly be valuable .",
    "the component a also shows rv variations .",
    "independent rv measurements of the heii  @xmath64686 and the hei  @xmath65876 lines yield essentially the same relatively eccentric ( @xmath40 ) orbit , characterized by a period close to 498 days and a semi - amplitude of the order of 65  kms@xmath7 .",
    "we feel that the component a and the close binary system b are in wide orbit about each other .",
    "the long - term periodicity observed in the rvs of the component a must then be related to the mutual orbit of both objects .",
    "if that is the case , and we are indeed in the presence of a triple ( hierarchy 2 + 1 ) system , then we should expect the systemic velocity of the binary b to change with a period @xmath41 days .",
    "to prove this hypothesis , we computed a joint orbital solution considering the rvs of the component a of the hei  @xmath65876 line for the primary , and the systemic velocities of the system b , @xmath42 , for the secondary .",
    "the @xmath42 values were calculated according to the basic expression @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the minimum masses from table  [ tbl-2 ] , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the rvs of the components b1 and b2 of the hei  @xmath65876 line , respectively .",
    "the resulting solution is characterized by the parameters in the last column of table  [ tbl-3 ] and the rv curves in the lower panel of figure  [ rvcurves ] .",
    "although with somewhat larger dispersion , these curves represent practically the same orbit as those derived from the rv data of a alone , as can be easily verified by confronting the orbital parameters listed in the different columns of table  [ tbl-3 ] . we note here that the joint solution was obtained in a completely independent manner , supporting the idea of the mutual orbital motion between a and b.    comparing the projected mass of the system b from table  [ tbl-3 ] with the projected total mass of the close pair b1+b2 from table  [ tbl-2 ] , it can be shown that @xmath48 .",
    "this means that the inclinations of the two orbital planes satisfy either @xmath49 or @xmath50 . in the first case",
    ", the inner and the outer orbits of the triple system will be nearly coplanar , whereas in the last case the relative inclination between the orbital planes , @xmath51 , will lie between @xmath52 ( fekel 1981 ) .",
    "the relative orientation of the orbits in a multiple system is of particular interest because of its direct relationship with the conditions at the epoch of formation .",
    "thus , the study of a triple system as young as her36 can provide important clues to the formation processes of massive stellar systems .    on the other hand , comparing the minimum mass for the primary a ( 19.2  @xmath53 ) to typical masses of o7.5v stars from gies ( 2003 )",
    ", we estimate that @xmath54 is most probably larger than 70@xmath39 . the component a has the largest individual mass of the three stars .",
    "its mass is however fairly comparable with the total mass of the inner binary b. according to table  [ tbl-3 ] , the minimum mass of the triple system is @xmath55  @xmath53 . assuming a minimum inclination @xmath56",
    ", we conclude that the total mass of her36 is probably no larger than 54  @xmath53 .",
    "the triple zams system her36 is really peculiar , and it undoubtedly deserves additional study .",
    "clearly , further observations are required before a complete characterization of the orbits can be given and a definitive model for the system can be derived .",
    "spectroscopic observations with higher signal - to - noise ratio , as well as an exhaustive program of photometric monitoring , seem essential .",
