    "<S> the electric quadrupole coupling constant of the @xmath0al ground state is measured to be @xmath1 using two different @xmath2-nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) techniques . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , a direct comparison is made between the continuous rf technique and the adiabatic fast passage method . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained coupling constants of both methods are in excellent agreement with each other and a precise value for the quadrupole moment of @xmath0al has been deduced : @xmath3 = 134.0(16 ) mb . comparison of this value with large - scale shell - model calculations in the sd and sdpf valence spaces suggests that the @xmath0al ground state is dominated by normal sd - shell configurations with a possible small contribution of intruder states . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained value for @xmath4 and a compilation of measured quadrupole moments of odd - z even - n isotopes in comparison with shell - model calculations shows that the proton effective charge @xmath5 provides a much better description of the nuclear properties in the sd - shell than the adopted value @xmath6 .    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    @xmath0al , island of inversion , electric quadrupole moment , @xmath2 nuclear magnetic resonance ( @xmath2-nmr ) , shell model 21.10.ky , 21.60.cs , 24.70.@xmath7s , 27.30.@xmath7 t , 25.70.mn , 29.27.hj , 76.60.@xmath8k </S>"
