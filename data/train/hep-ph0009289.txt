    "the higgs boson is the only particle in the standard model ( sm ) that has not yet been confirmed experimentally .",
    "it is responsible for the mass generation of fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "the search for the higgs boson is the main priority in high energy experiments and hints of its existence may have been already seen at lep@xcite at around @xmath3 gev .",
    "however , once found the detailed study of its couplings could give information on the mass generation mechanism and on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "an intermediate - mass higgs boson could also be produced in peripheral heavy ion collisions through photon - photon interactions @xcite .",
    "this possibility , in the context of the sm , has been explored in detail in the literature @xcite , with the general conclusion that the chances of finding the standard model higgs in the photon - photon case are marginal .",
    "however , the standard model is only an effective low energy theory of a more complete model and one expects deviations from its predictions .",
    "a convenient way to parameterize deviations of the standard model predictions is the effective theory approach @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", we assume that the existence of new physics , associated with a high  energy scale @xmath4 , can manifest itself at low energies via the process of integrating - out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "these effects are then described by effective operators involving the spectrum of particles belonging to the low  energy theory . at this point",
    "we have two possibilities : either the higgs boson is light and it should be included in the effective operators or the higgs boson is heavy and should also be integrated out . in this work",
    "we will adopt the former possibility , where the gauge group @xmath5 is linearly realized . in this case , the effective lagrangian will generate anomalous higgs couplings .    in this letter",
    "we explore the capabilities of peripheral heavy ion collisions in constraining anomalous higgs couplings , which could in principle arise from new physics beyond the sm .",
    "we analyse the processes @xmath6 . after simulating the signal and background",
    ", we find optimal cuts to maximize their ratio .",
    "we show how to use energy and invariant mass spectra of the final state @xmath7 or photon pair in order to identify the presence of a higgs boson and extract information about its couplings .",
    "finally , we compare the bounds on the anomalous couplings that will be possible to extract from our analyses to bounds coming from other processes in different machines .",
    "in the linear representation of the @xmath5 symmetry breaking mechanism , the sm model is the lowest order approximation while the first corrections , which are of dimension six , can be written as @xmath8 where the operators @xmath9 involve vector ",
    "boson and/or higgs  boson fields with couplings @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this effective lagrangian describes the phenomenology of models that are somehow close to the sm since a light higgs scalar doublet is still present at low energies . of the eleven possible operators @xmath11 that are @xmath12 and @xmath13 even ,",
    "only three of them modify the higgs ",
    "boson couplings to photons @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the higgs doublet , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being respectively the @xmath20 and @xmath21 field strength tensors . in the unitary gauge , the anomalous @xmath0 coupling is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the electroweak coupling constant and @xmath26 .",
    "the operator @xmath27 contributes at tree level to the vector  boson two  point functions , and consequently is severely constrained by low ",
    "energy data @xcite . the present 95% cl limits on these operators for 90 gev @xmath28 800 gev and @xmath29 gev read @xcite , @xmath30",
    "the remaining operators can be indirectly constrained via their one  loop contributions to low ",
    "energy observables , which are suppressed by factors @xmath31 . using the `` naturalness '' assumption that large cancellations do not occur among their contributions",
    ", we can consider only the effect of one operator at a time . in this case , the following constraints at 95% cl ( in units of tev@xmath32 ) arise @xcite @xmath33 these limits depend in a complex way on the higgs mass .",
    "the values quoted above for the sake of illustration were obtained for @xmath34 gev .",
    "there are also limits coming from direct higgs searches at lep ii @xcite , tevatron @xcite colliders .",
    "the combined analysis @xcite of these signatures yields the following 95% cl bounds on the anomalous higgs interactions ( in tev@xmath32 ) : @xmath35 for @xmath36 gev .",
    "these limits can be improved by a factor 23 in the upgraded tevatron runs .",
    "the 95% cl bounds on the anomalous higgs interactions ( in tev@xmath32 ) coming from direct higgs searches via gluon gluon fusion at lhc @xcite collider are @xmath37 for @xmath36 gev .",
    "the anomalous higgs interaction @xmath38 can also be constrained by their effect on the triple gauge  boson vertices , but this is not the case for @xmath39 nor @xmath40 .    in the following",
    "we will present our limits in terms of the relevant combination @xmath41 which is the only combination of anomalous couplings directly measured in the processes we study .",
    "in order to perform the monte carlo analysis , we have employed the package madgraph @xcite coupled to helas @xcite .",
    "special subroutines were constructed for the anomalous contribution which enable us to take into account all interference effects between the qed and the anomalous amplitudes .",
    "the phase space integration was performed by vegas @xcite .",
    "the photon distribution in the nucleus can be described using the equivalent - photon or weizscker - williams approximation in the impact parameter space . denoting the photon distribution function in a nucleus by @xmath42 , which represents the number of photons carrying a fraction between @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the total momentum of a nucleus of charge @xmath45",
    ", we can define the two - photon luminosity through @xmath46    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the square of the center of mass ( c.m.s . )",
    "system energy of the two photons and @xmath49 of the ion - ion system .",
    "the total cross section @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are the particles produced by the @xmath52 process , is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the cross - section of the subprocess @xmath55 .",
    "we choose to use the conservative and more realistic photon distribution of cahn and jackson  @xcite , including a prescription proposed by baur  @xcite for realistic peripheral collisions , where we must enforce that the minimum impact parameter ( @xmath56 ) should be larger than @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the nuclear radius of the ion @xmath59 .",
    "a useful fit for the two - photon luminosity is : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the nucleus mass , @xmath63 its radius and @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 which is a fit resulting from the numerical integration of the photon distribution , accurate to @xmath66 or better for @xmath67 , and where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath74 we use the expression ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath75 ^ 3 .",
    "\\label{e5}\\ ] ] we consider ca - ca collisions since they are the most promissing ones to put limits on the anomalous couplings because of the larger luminosity of the ca beams .",
    "the energy for @xmath76ca considered was 140 tev / beam with a luminosity of @xmath77 cm@xmath32 s@xmath79 at lhc @xcite .",
    "since the collider will run in the heavy ion mode only a few months per year we will consider two possibilities for an integrated luminosity per year , one optmistic of 50 pb@xmath79 year@xmath79 and another more realistic of 10 pb@xmath79 year@xmath79 .",
    "in our analyses we computed the sm and anomalous cross sections for the higgs production via photon - photon fusion in peripheral heavy ion collisions at lhc using similar cuts and efficiencies as the ones atlas collaboration @xcite applied in their studies of higgs boson searches .",
    "we begin our analyses imposing the following acceptance cuts @xmath80 and taking into account an efficiency for reconstruction and identification of one photon of 84% and a b - tagging of 60% @xcite .    in order to improve our limits on the anomalous couplings ,",
    "we have studied several kinematical distributions of the final state particles .",
    "the most promissing one is the invariant mass of the final particles , since the anomalous interactions occur mainly for the higgs boson produced on - shell .",
    "for instance , the number of sm cross section for the process @xmath81 with @xmath82 gev falls from @xmath8325.4 pb to @xmath834.06 pb when the cut @xmath84 gev is applied .",
    "the pure anomalous cross section for @xmath85 with @xmath86 tev@xmath32 falls from 16.2 pb to 15.8 pb , being almost unaffected by the invariant mass cut .",
    "the significance of a anomalous signal , given by @xmath87 , is enhanced by a factor of 2.4 when the invariant mass cut is used .",
    "therefore , for the photon - photon initial state , we collected the final state @xmath52 and/or @xmath7 events whose invariant masses fall in bins of size of 15 gev around the higgs mass @xmath88 in order to evaluate our results .    considering the set of cuts ( [ cut1 ] ) and ( [ cut2 ] ) , the luminosity and efficiencies discussed above , and a higgs mass in the range ( 115180 ) gev , the number of standard model events for the process @xmath89 is smaller than one since the highest standard model cross section is smaller than 3 fb .",
    "since we expect nearly zero events for this process , a 95% cl limit for the anomalous couplings is obtained when its contribution generates 3 events .    in table",
    "[ cross_sec ] we present the standard model cross section for the process @xmath90 considering a higgs mass in the range ( 115180 ) gev .",
    "for example , for a higgs mass of 115 gev , the number of standard model events is @xmath83 73(15 ) in one year when we consider a luminosity of 50(10 ) pb@xmath79year@xmath79 , including b - tagging efficiency . in this case , a 95% cl signal is obtained when the number of sm events ( @xmath91 ) is changed by a value of @xmath92 if @xmath91 is greater than 10 units , otherwise we apply poisson statistics for few background events .    in tables",
    "[ fall_gamma ] and [ fall_b ] we present the limits for @xmath93 considering the same range of higgs masses .",
    "the limits are more stringent in the @xmath1 case , where the number of events is larger .",
    "the limits get worse for @xmath94 gev because the total higgs width increases due to the opening of @xmath95 decay channel .",
    "the pure anomalous contribution to the process @xmath96 is quadratic in the anomalous coupling because there is only one anomalous vertex in this case . in figs .",
    "[ htb1](a ) and [ htb1](b ) the number of @xmath7 events in the lhc heavy ion mode as a function of the anomalous coupling @xmath93 is shown together with the sm 95% cl region for @xmath97 gev and a luminosity of 50 and 10 pb@xmath79year@xmath79 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , for the process @xmath89 , the pure anomalous contribution is proportional to the fourth power in the anomalous coupling because there are two anomalous vertices in this case , as shown in figs .",
    "[ htb2](a ) and [ htb2](b ) .",
    "in this work we have studied the sensitivity of the heavy ion mode of the lhc to anomalous higgs boson couplings to photons , @xmath0 , through the analysis of the processes @xmath6 in peripheral heavy ion collisions .",
    "our best limits for the photon - photon initial state are ( in tev@xmath32 ) , @xmath98 and @xmath99 for an integrated luminosity 50 ( 10 ) pb@xmath79 year@xmath79 , including @xmath100 identification and b - tagging efficiencies .      in conclusion ,",
    "the limits for anomalous higgs couplings that can be obtained in peripheral heavy ion collisions at the lhc via electromagnetic processes are a factor of five tighter than the limits that can be obtained in the upgraded tevatron . however",
    "the proton - proton mode of the lhc will be able to put stronger constraints due to its higher luminosity .",
