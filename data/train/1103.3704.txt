    "many applications require understanding how disordered materials flow under an external load such as a shear stress  @xcite .",
    "deriving such an understanding from thermodynamic principles requires identifying relationships between thermodynamic parameters and transport .",
    "since external loads drive systems out of equilibrium , their thermodynamics can not be described solely in terms of equilibrium parameters like temperature and pressure .",
    "however , simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite show that sheared spherical particles possess an _ effective _ temperature that relates low - frequency fluctuations of various observable quantities to their associated response functions .",
    "this effective temperature is likely to feature prominently in any thermodynamics - based description of flow in glassy materials  @xcite .",
    "first , the relationship between transport and effective temperature must be established .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we begun to establish a relationship between mobility and effective temperature @xmath2 by studying the behavior of a mixture of soft , repulsive disks in two dimensions at a packing fraction above random close packing over a range of shear strain rates @xmath1 and kinetic temperatures @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the system only flows under shear if @xmath2 exceeds a threshold value similar to the dynamic glass transition temperature . under strong shearing",
    ", we found that the average shear stress is proportional to a boltzmann factor containing the effective temperature .",
    "these results imply that the effective temperature plays a key role in facilitating the mobility of sheared systems .    here , in order to further elucidate this role , we determine the relationship between mobility and @xmath2 over a wide range of parameters for a hard sphere model .",
    "the advantages of the hard sphere model are twofold .",
    "first , due to the hard - core nature of the interactions , @xmath2 can only control the behavior of the model via a dimensionless parameter .",
    "using the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure and @xmath7 is the sphere diameter , facilitates a direct comparison with the equilibrium system , where @xmath13 is the relevant control parameter .",
    "second , the relationship between mobility and @xmath5 should capture the leading order behavior of soft repulsive systems , provided that parameters continue to be expressed in dimensionless form  @xcite .",
    "we find a crossover in the relationship between @xmath2 and the relaxation time @xmath4 that characterizes the mobility . in the _ solid response _",
    "regime , @xmath4 depends on @xmath2 at fixed packing fraction according to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 depends weakly on @xmath0 , suggesting that the average local yield strain is proportional to a boltzmann factor containing the effective temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the effective temperature s role in shear transformation zone theory , where @xmath2 controls the density of zones that are susceptible to shear deformation  @xcite . in the _ fluid response _ regime",
    ", the relaxation time depends on @xmath5 as it depends on @xmath10 in equilibrium .",
    "this regime includes both near - equilibrium conditions where @xmath11 and far - from - equilibrium conditions where @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that the mechanisms that control transport for the equilibrium fluid persist under shear even where the slow degrees of freedom responsible for transport fall out of equilibrium with fast degrees of freedom .",
    "our model is a mixture of 4096 hard spheres of mass @xmath14 , half each of diameter @xmath7 and @xmath15 to avoid crystallization .",
    "we conduct event - driven molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite at fixed packing fraction @xmath0 and uniform shear strain rate @xmath1 under lees - edwards boundary conditions .",
    "maintaining such a system in steady state requires dissipating energy .",
    "we perform two separate sets of simulations using two different methods to dissipate energy . for _ inelastic _ simulations , we dissipate energy at each collision by imposing a coefficient of restitution @xmath16 . for _",
    "thermostatted _ simulations , we let collisions be purely elastic ( @xmath17 ) but dissipate energy into a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath3 by periodically rescaling the velocities @xmath18 to keep the kinetic temperature @xmath19 within @xmath20 of @xmath3 . although there are three control parameters for each set of simulations ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath21 or @xmath3 ) , one of them can be absorbed into the unit of time ; for instance , time can be measured in units of @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "there are therefore only two independent , dimensionless control parameters , the packing fraction @xmath0 and a parameter that controls the strength of shearing . while @xmath24 and @xmath21 are both valid dimensionless control parameters , we choose to represent the strength of shearing in both sets of simulations by the ratio @xmath25 of shear stress to pressure .",
    "for the thermostatted and inelastic simulations , @xmath25 can be increased at fixed @xmath0 by increasing the shear strain rate @xmath24 or decreasing @xmath21 , respectively ; the equilibrium limit @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we characterize the mobility by the relaxation time @xmath4 defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the root - mean - squared displacement in the direction perpendicular to the shear plane .    as we will discuss in the following section , we define the effective temperature @xmath2 as the value that replaces the temperature @xmath31 to satisfy two independent fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
    "the first fluctuation - dissipation relation is the compressibility equation relating the compressibility to the amplitude of density fluctuations , @xmath32 we define the isothermal compressibility out of equilibrium as the compressibility at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath25 , @xmath33 which we calculate by composing partial derivatives and taking finite differences .",

    ", we find such a collapse for all observable quantities that we measure , indicating that the behavior of the model is insensitive to the way that energy is dissipated .",
    "the breakdown of this collapse at very high @xmath25 is due to an unphysical layering transition that occurs for sheared spheres coupled to a profile - biased thermostat  @xcite . at these values of @xmath25 ,",
    "the data for the inelastic simulations should be considered the physically realistic branch .",
    "the second important feature of fig .  [ compress ] ( a ) and ( b ) is that the data in panel ( a ) and ( b ) are not identical , indicating that the compressibility equation does _ not _ hold under strong shear . in particular , while the measured compressibility at fixed @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath25 , the compressibility expected from applying the compressibility equation to the measured density fluctuations increases with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , following the procedure practiced in previous studies of effective temperature  @xcite , we can define a temperature - like parameter @xmath56 as the quantity that replaces @xmath31 to satisfy eq .",

    "the system exhibits shear thinning , with @xmath70 decreasing with increasing @xmath25 .",

    "the jamming phase diagram provides a framework for applying our hard - sphere results to systems with soft interactions . moving away from the hard - sphere limit , the relaxation of soft , repulsive spheres varies continuously with the parameter @xmath88 that characterizes the softness of the potential  @xcite .",
    "even far from the hard - sphere limit , where the relaxation time is not adequately approximated by its form at @xmath129 the dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath13 ( with no shear ) can be mapped onto the hard - sphere behavior by computing an effective hard - sphere diameter from the structure of the soft - sphere system  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that while the numeric form of the relaxation changes far away from @xmath130 , the mechanisms remain the same .",
    "we therefore expect that for @xmath131 the effective temperature continues to facilitate relaxation via the same two mechanisms as in the hard sphere limit .",
    "while the boundaries between the two mechanisms may shift at elevated @xmath88 , we expect that the solid response will continue to dominate at low @xmath10 and high @xmath25 while the fluid response dominates elsewhere .",
    "analysis of our earlier simulations  @xcite of sheared two - dimensional soft disks in terms of dimensionless quantities is consistent with this picture .",
    "we have shown that the ratio of effective temperature to pressure , @xmath5 , controls the mobility of sheared hard spheres throughout the unjammed region of the jamming phase diagram spanned by packing fraction and applied shear stress .",
    "the effective temperature characterizes both the amplitude of static density fluctuations relative to the compressibility and the amplitude of low - frequency shear stress fluctuations relative to the shear viscosity . at high shear stress and low kinetic temperature ,",
    "the effective temperature departs significantly from the kinetic temperature that characterizes high - frequency fluctuations . in this",
    "far - from - equilibrium regime , the effective temperature , not the kinetic temperature , controls the diffusive motion of the spheres .",
    "we find that the mechanism by which @xmath5 controls the mobility depends on where the system lies in the jamming phase diagram , crossing over between two regimes .",
    "for very low values of the kinetic temperature relative to the pressure , the sheared hard spheres respond like a solid .",
    "they maintain an average local yield strain that depends on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the functional form of this dependence is consistent with the effective temperature s thermodynamic role in the solid - based shear transformation zone theory , in which the effective temperature controls the density of localized zones susceptible to plastic deformation . in contrast , for moderate or large values of the kinetic temperature , the sheared hard spheres respond like a fluid .",
    "the relaxation time depends on temperature in the same way as does the unsheared , equilibrium system , except that the relevant temperature is the effective temperature , _ not _ the kinetic temperature .",
    "this suggests that , just as the temperature facilitates flow in the unsheared system by doing work against the pressure , the effective temperature mobilizes the sheared spheres by working against the pressure to open up free volume .    by expressing our results in relation to the dimensionless version of the jamming phase diagram ,",
    "we have illustrated how these mechanisms likely apply for systems with soft repulsive potentials .",
    "it remains to be seen to what extent these mechanisms hold for systems with attractions .",
