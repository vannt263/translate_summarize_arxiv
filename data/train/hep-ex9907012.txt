    "one of the most powerful tools to investigate the structure of quasi - real photons , @xmath1 , is the measurement of photon structure functions in deep inelastic electron - photon scattering at electron - positron colliders , shown in figure  [ fig01 ] .",
    "these measurements have by now a tradition of eighteen years since the first  was obtained by pluto  @xcite . the lep accelerator is a unique place for the measurements of photon structure functions until a high energy linear collider is realised .",
    "it is unique because of the large coverage in  owing to the various beam energies covered within the lep programme , and due to the high luminosities delivered to the experiments .",
    "the main idea is that by measuring the differential cross - section @xmath2\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one obtains the photon structure function . here",
    "@xmath3 is the absolute value of the four momentum squared of the virtual photon , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the usual dimensionless variables of deep inelastic scattering and  is the fine structure constant . in the region of small @xmath6",
    "studied ( @xmath7 ) the contribution of the term proportional to  is small and it is usually neglected . in leading order  is proportional to the parton content , @xmath8 , of the photon , @xmath9 for quarks , and therefore reveals the internal structure of the photon .",
    "because the energy of the quasi - real photon is not known , @xmath5 has to be derived by measuring the invariant mass of the final state @xmath10 , which consists of  pairs for the investigation of the qed structure of the photon , or of hadrons created by a quark pair in studies of . in the case of  final states",
    "the invariant mass can be determined accurately , and measurements of the qed structure are generally statistically limited . for hadronic final states",
    "the measurement of @xmath5 is a source of significant uncertainties which makes measurements of  mainly systematics limited .",
    "if both photons are virtual an effective structure function  of virtual photons can be determined in the region @xmath11 and , for @xmath12 the differential cross - section for the exchange of two virtual photons is probed .",
    "here @xmath13 is the qcd scale .",
    "the different measurements performed to investigate the qed and qcd structure of the photon are discussed in the following .",
    "several measurements concerning the qed structure of the photon have been performed by various experiments . prior to lep , mainly  of quasi - real photons was measured .",
    "the lep experiments refined the analysis of the  final state , and derived more information on the qed structure of the photon .",
    "the interest in the investigation of the qed structure of the photon is twofold .",
    "firstly the investigations serve as tests of qed to order @xmath14 , but secondly , and also very important , the investigations are used to refine the experimentalists tools in a real but clean experimental situation to investigate the possibilities of extracting similar information from the much more complex hadronic final state .      the structure function  has been measured using data in the approximate range of average virtualities  of @xmath15  .",
    "results were published by cello  @xcite , delphi  @xcite , l3  @xcite , opal  @xcite , pluto  @xcite and tpc/2@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "additional preliminary results are available from aleph  @xcite and delphi  @xcite .",
    "the aleph results are preliminary since two years and therefore they are not considered here .",
    "the delphi result at @xmath16  is going to replace the published measurement , which will still be used here .",
    "special care has to be taken when comparing the experimental results to the qed predictions , because slightly different quantities are derived by the experiments .",
    "some of the experiments express their result as an average structure function , @xmath17 , measured within their experimental acceptance in , whereas the other experiments unfold their result as a structure function for an average  value , @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig02 ] shows a summary of the  measurements compared either to @xmath17 , assuming a flat acceptance in , or to @xmath18 , while using the appropriate values for  and  given by the experiments . for the measurements which quote an average virtuality  of the quasi - real photon for their dataset",
    ", this value is chosen in the comparison , otherwise @xmath19 is used .",
    "there is agreement between the data and the qed expectations for about three orders of magnitude in .",
    "some differences are seen for the tpc/2@xmath1 result , but at these low values of  this could also be due to the simple averaging procedure used for the theoretical prediction .",
    "the lep data are so precise that the effect of the small virtuality of the quasi - real photon can clearly be established , as shown , for example , in figure  [ fig03 ] for the most precise data from opal .",
    "the data are compared to the qed predictions of ( x,,,@xmath20 ) , where either  or @xmath20 is varied .",
    "the mass of the muon is found to be @xmath21  , assuming the  value predicted by qed .",
    "although this is not a precise measurement of the mass of the muon it can serve as an indication on the achievable precision for the determination of @xmath13 , if it only were for the pointlike contribution to .",
    "the structure functions  and  are obtained from the measured  and a fit to the shape of the distribution of the azimuthal angle , which is the angle between the plane defined by the momentum vectors of the muons and the plane defined by the momentum vectors of the incoming and the deeply inelastically scattered electron . for small values of @xmath6",
    ", the  distribution can be written as : @xmath22 with parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the recent theoretical predictions  @xcite which take into account the important mass corrections up to are consistent with the results from l3  @xcite and opal  @xcite and with the preliminary results from delphi  @xcite , as shown for the ratios in figure  [ fig04 ] .    both  and  are found to be significantly different from zero .",
    "the cross - section for the exchange of two highly virtual photons in the kinematical region under study can schematically be written as : @xmath25 here the total cross - sections , ,  and  and the interference terms  and  correspond to specific helicity states of the photons ( t = transverse and l = longitudinal ) , and  is the angle between the electron scattering planes .",
    "there is good agreement between the measured  from opal  @xcite and the qed predictions using the vermaseren and the galuga monte carlo programs , provided all terms of the differential cross - section are taken into account .",
    "however , as apparent from figure  [ fig05 ] , if either  ( dot - dash ) or both  and  ( dash ) are neglected in the qed prediction as implemented in the galuga monte carlo , there is a clear disagreement between the data and the qed prediction .",
    "this measurement shows that both terms ,  and especially , are present in the data in the kinematical region of the analysis , mainly at @xmath26 , and that the corresponding contributions to the cross - section are negative .",
    "as the kinematically accessible range in terms of  and for the measurement of the qed and the qcd structure of the photon is the same , and given the size of the interference terms in the leptonic case , special care has to be taken when the measurements on the qcd structure are interpreted in terms of hadronic structure functions of virtual photons .",
    "the hadronic structure function  contains two contributions from the different appearances of the resolved photon , namely the point - like component stemming from the point - like coupling of the photon to quarks , and the hadron - like component originating from the fluctuations of the photon into a hadronic state with the same quantum numbers as the photon .",
    "the hadron - like part can be modelled by vector meson dominance and obeys the same evolution equations as the structure function of an ordinary hadron like the proton .",
    "the composition of these two components predicted by the grv parametrisation of  is shown in figure  [ fig06 ] . with increasing  the hadron - like contribution dies out at large @xmath5 and creates the steep rise at low @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the point - like component increases with   at large @xmath5 , the unique feature of  compared to . in the present investigations of both",
    "these features are investigated .",
    "the shape of  as a function of @xmath5 at fixed  is studied with emphasis on the low-@xmath5 behaviour of  in comparison to , and the evolution of  with  is measured mainly at medium @xmath5 .",
    "the adequate description of the hadronic final state by the monte carlo models is very important for measurements of the photon structure . during",
    "the lep2 workshop general purpose monte carlo programs became available for deep inelastic electron - photon scattering .",
    "the first serious attempt to confront these models with the experimental data has been performed by opal  @xcite .",
    "it was found , that none of the monte carlo programs available at that time was able to satisfactorily reproduce the data distributions .",
    "therefore , the full spread of the predictions was included in the systematic error of the  measurement , which consequently suffered from large systematic errors .",
    "an important quantity is the flow of hadronic energy as a function of the pseudorapidity , .",
    "a significant fraction of the energy flow goes into the forward region of the detectors which are only equipped with electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "given this , the detectors are precise enough to disentangle various predictions in the central part of the detector , however they are not able to distinguish very well between models which produce different energy flow distributions in the forward region .    the various monte carlo models produce significantly different hadronic energy flows , which leads to the fact that for a given value of @xmath27 , the visible invariant mass  is rather different when using different monte carlo models , with the largest differences occuring at low values of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the models discussed above the phojet and the twogam monte carlo models were used in a structure function analysis from l3  @xcite , where the prediction of the hadronic energy flow for these two models was compared to the data for the range @xmath28  .",
    "again , these two models , although closer to the data than the herwig5.8d and pythia predictions in the case of the opal analysis , do not accurately account for the features observed in the data distributions .",
    "several methods were investigated to reduce the dependence on the monte carlo models : @xmath29 motivated by the observation made in photoproduction studies at hera  @xcite , the herwig5.9 model was tuned  @xcite by changing the distribution of , the intrinsic transverse momentum of the quarks inside the photon from a gaussian to a power - law behaviour of the form @xmath30 . in the latest version the upper limit of  is dynamically adjusted on an event by event basis .",
    "@xmath29 the longitudinal momentum of the photon - photon system is unknown , but the transverse momentum is well constrained by measuring the transverse momentum of the scattered electron . this fact is used to replace a part of the measurement of the hadronic system by quantities obtained from the scattered electron , and thereby a part of the uncertainty of the measurement of the hadronic final state can be eliminated .",
    "the distribution of the invariant mass reconstructed in this scheme by l3  @xcite is closer to the @xmath27 distribution than the  distribution , but still the agreement with @xmath27 is not very good .",
    "@xmath29 another way of reducing the model dependence is to perform the unfolding in two dimensions .",
    "preliminary results from the aleph  @xcite and opal  @xcite experiments show that this indeed reduces the systematic uncertainty on the  measurement .",
    "@xmath29 in order to establish a consistent picture a combined effort by the aleph , l3 and opal collaborations and the lep two - photon working group has been undertaken  @xcite .",
    "the data of the experiments have been analysed in two regions of , @xmath31  and @xmath32  , using identical cuts and also identical monte carlo events passed through the respective programs of the individual experiments to simulate the detector response .",
    "the data distributions are corrected to the hadron level , allowing for a direct comparison to the predictions of the monte carlo models .",
    "it was found , that for large regions in most of the distributions studied , the results of the different experiments are closer to each other than the sizable differences which are found between the data and the models .    from the discussion above it is clear , that the error on the measurement of  will vary strongly with the monte carlo models chosen to obtain the systematic uncertainty .",
    "however , given the improved understanding of the shortcomings and the combined effort on improving on the monte carlo description of the data , it is likely that the error on will shrink considerably in future measurements .",
    "many measurements of the hadronic structure function  have been performed at several electron - positron colliders . in this review",
    "the interpretation of the data will be based on the published results , and on those preliminary results from the lep experiments , which are based on data which have not yet been published . for the preliminary results",
    "@xcite which are meant to replace a published measurement in the near future the published result will be shown until the new result is finalised .",
    "the range in  covered by the various experiments is @xmath33  , which is impressive given the small cross - section of the process . in figure  [ fig07 ] the published results from aleph  @xcite amy  @xcite , delphi  @xcite , jade  @xcite , l3  @xcite , opal  @xcite , pluto  @xcite , tasso  @xcite , tpc/2@xmath1",
    "@xcite and topaz  @xcite are shown together with additional preliminary results from aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite and l3  @xcite .",
    "the precision of the measurements of  which have been performed at  centre - of - mass energies below the mass of the @xmath34 boson is mainly limited by the statistical error and , due to the simple assumptions made on the hadronic final state , the systematic errors are small , but in light of the discussion above , they maybe underestimated .",
    "some of the data show quite unexpected features .",
    "for example , the as obtained from tpc/2@xmath1 shows an unexpected shape at low values of @xmath5 , and also the results from topaz rise very fast towards low values of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition there is a clear disagreement between the tasso and jade data at @xmath35  .",
    "the measurement of  has attracted a lot of interest at lep over the last years .",
    "the lep collaborations have measured  in the range @xmath36  1 and @xmath37 . as seen from figure  [ fig07 ]",
    "the measurements obtained at lep1 energies ( open symbols ) are consistent with those obtained at lep2 energies ( closed symbols ) .",
    "the comparison to the grv higher order prediction of  shows an overall agreement , but also some regions where the prediction does not so well coincide with the data .",
    "this large amount of data , which partly is rather precise , gives the possibility to study the consistency of the predictions with the data .",
    "the quality of the agreement is evaluated by a simple  method based on : @xmath38 where the sum runs over all measurements in figure  [ fig07 ] with @xmath39 , where  is the starting scale of the evolution for the respective parametrisation of .",
    "the term  denotes the measured value of  in the @xmath40 bin and @xmath41 is its total error .",
    "the theoretical expectation is approximated by the average  in that bin in @xmath5 for @xmath42 and for @xmath19 , abbreviated by @xmath43 .",
    "the procedure does not take into account the correlation of errors between the data points .",
    "a more accurate analysis would require to study in detail the correlation between the results within one experiment , but even more difficult , the correlation between the results from different experiments , a major task which is beyond the scope of the comparison presented here .",
    "the predictions used in the comparison are the whit parametrisations , which are the most recent parametrisations based on purely phenomenological fits to the data , and the grv and sas1d predictions which use some theoretical prejudice to construct the hadron - like part of  at .",
    "the values of  found are : grv lo ( 1.55 ) , grv ho ( 1.64 ) , grschienbein lo ( 1.58 ) , sas1d ( 1.81 ) , sas1 m ( 1.50 ) , for @xmath44 data points with @xmath45  , and sas2d ( 0.97 ) , sas2 m ( 1.01 ) , whit1 ( 1.10 ) , whit2 ( 3.27 ) , whit3 ( 5.37 ) , whit4 ( 5.78 ) , whit5 ( 18.66 ) , whit6 ( 28.29 ) , for 132 data points with @xmath46  .",
    "the parametrisations describe the amy , jade , pluto and tasso data , and they all disfavour the tpc/2@xmath1 results .",
    "the whit parametrisations predict a faster rise at low-@xmath5 than the grv , grsc and the sas parametrisations .",
    "therefore , the agreement with the topaz data is satisfactory for the whit parametrisations , whereas the grv , grsc and the sas1 parametrisations yield values of  of around 2 , and the sas2 parametrisations lie somewhere between these extremes . for the same reason the whit parametrisations fail to describe the aleph and delphi data which tend to be low at low values of @xmath5 , thereby leading to large  for the whit parametrisations , especially for the sets whit4 - 6 which use a larger gluon distribution functions . the only acceptable agreement is achieved by using the set whit1 .",
    "the opal results tend to be high at low values of @xmath5 and also they have larger errors , therefore only the extreme cases whit5 - 6 lead to unacceptable values of .",
    "the quoted uncertainties by l3 are very small and the results tend to be high for low values of . consequently , none of the parametrisations which are valid below @xmath47  is able to describe the l3 data and all lead to large values of . for @xmath48",
    "the agreement improves but the values of are still too large , besides for grsc . for the parametrisations valid for @xmath48  the best agreement with the l3 data is obtained for whit1 .",
    "this comparison shows that already at the present level of accuracy the measurements of  are precise enough to constrain the parametrisations and to discard those which predict a fast rise at low @xmath5 driven by large gluon distribution functions .",
    "the second topic which is extensively studied using the large lever arm in , is the evolution of  with .",
    "a collection of all available measurements of the evolution of  at medium @xmath5 for four active flavours is shown in figure  [ fig08 ] . for pluto",
    "the average  in the range @xmath49 for the  values of the analyses has been added to the published three flavour result .",
    "unfortunately the different experiments quote their results for different ranges in @xmath5 which makes the comparison more difficult because the predictions for the various ranges in @xmath5 start to be significantly different for @xmath50  , as can be seen in figure  [ fig08 ] .",
    "the measurements are consistent with each other and a clear rise of  with  is observed .",
    "it is an interesting fact that this rise can be described reasonably well ( @xmath51 accuracy ) by the leading order augmented asymptotic prediction detailed in  @xcite , which uses the asymptotic solution  @xcite for  for the light flavour contribution as predicted by perturbative qcd for @xmath52 .    in order to look at the variation of the scaling violation as a function of @xmath5",
    "the data from figure  [ fig07 ] are displayed differently in figure  [ fig09 ] .",
    "the data are shown as a function of , divided in bins of @xmath5 , with average values as shown in the figure .",
    "each individual measurement is attributed to the bin with the closest average value in @xmath5 used . to separate the measurements from each other an integer value , n , counting the bin number",
    "is added to the measured .",
    "the theoretical prediction is the average  in each bin .",
    "the  ranges used for the predictions are the maximum ranges possible for @xmath53  and @xmath54  .",
    "the general trend of the data is followed by the predictions of the augmented asymptotic solution , and the grv and sas1d leading order parametrisations of , however , differences are seen which were discussed above .",
    "the structure functions of virtual photons can be determined in the region @xmath55 by measuring the cross - sections for events where both electrons are observed .",
    "an effective structure function @xmath56 can be measured by experiments , however , to relate  to the structure functions  and  further assumptions are needed . by assuming that the interference terms do not contribute , that  is negligible and also using @xmath57 , the relation @xmath58 is derived . due to the  suppression of the cross - section these measurements suffer from low statistics .",
    "the first measurement of this type performed by pluto  @xcite , for @xmath59  and @xmath60  , has been compared in  @xcite to the theoretical predictions from the grs parametrisations .",
    "the best description of the data is obtained using the next - to - leading order result including a non - perturbative input at the starting scale of the evolution .",
    "if the hadron - like input is neglected , the prediction is consistently lower than the data , but still consistent with it , within the experimental errors .",
    "also the prediction obtained by calculating  solely from the box diagram is still consistent with the data although it is the lowest at high values of @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of  with  has been studied as well , including the result of  for the quasi - real photon .",
    "the data suggest a slow decrease with increasing , but they are also consistent with a constant behaviour . also for the  evolution of  the full next - to - leading order prediction gives the best description of the data and the purely perturbative prediction is at the low end .",
    "a similar measurement has been presented by l3",
    "the average virtualities for the l3 result are @xmath61   and @xmath62  , thereby ensuring @xmath11 . as in the case of pluto",
    "the qpm result is too low compared to the data .",
    "taking only  as calculated from the grs parametrisation of the parton distribution functions of the photon gets closer to the data , and the best description is found if the contribution of  is added to this , based on the prediction of the qpm .",
    "the data show a faster rise with @xmath5 than any of the predictions , however with large errors for increasing @xmath5 , which are mainly due to the low statistics available .",
    "the qpm prediction of the  evolution of  is consistent in shape with the data , but the predicted  is too low .",
    "however , the main difference comes from  at @xmath19 , which is not described by the quark parton model for @xmath63 , where the hadron - like component is expected to be largest .",
    "but in this region the data are even higher than the predictions of all parametrisations of  which contain a hadron - like contribution .",
    "the measurement at @xmath64 can not rule out the quark parton model prediction , although the data are consistently higher .",
    "the ratio of /  is similar for the pluto and l3 measurements , leading to values for @xmath65 of 2.6 and 3.5 respectively .",
    "this enables to compare the  evolution of the two measurements .",
    "the evolution is consistent with the expectation of the quark parton model for @xmath66 , and using the range @xmath67 .    in summary a consistent picture",
    "is found for the effective structure function of the virtual photon between the pluto and l3 data and the general features of both measurements are described by the next - to - leading order predictions . however , the data do not constrain the predictions very strongly and for more detailed comparisons to be made the full statistics of the lep2 programme has to be explored .    if both photons have similar virtualities",
    "the application of the photon structure function picture is no longer applicable and the data are interpreted in terms of the differential cross - section . due to the large virtualities",
    "the cross - section is small and large integrated luminosities are needed to precisely measure it .",
    "the main interest is the investigation of the hadronic structure of the interaction of two virtual photons .",
    "however , the interest in performing these measurements increased considerably in the last years , because calculations in the framework of the leading order bfkl evolution equation , which sums @xmath68 contributions , predicted a large cross - section  @xcite .",
    "the predicted cross - section is so large that already measurements with low statistics are able to decide whether the bfkl picture is in agreement with the measurements .",
    "recently theoretical progress has been made  @xcite to also include next - to - leading order pieces in the bfkl calculations  @xcite .",
    "large negative corrections to the leading order results were found , e.g.  @xcite , consequently , there is some doubt about the perturbative stability of the calculation .",
    "the theoretical development is underway and this should be kept in mind in comparisons to the bfkl predictions .",
    "the most suitable region for the comparison is @xmath69 , which ensures similar photon virtualities and large values of 1/@xmath5 .",
    "these requirements strongly reduce the available statistics , therefore compromises have to be made in this comparisons .",
    "the first measurement of this type was performed by l3  @xcite using data at @xmath70 and @xmath71  , and additional preliminary results were reported  @xcite for data taken at @xmath72  .",
    "the average photon virtualities ,  are 3.5 , 14 and 14.5  respectively .",
    "the @xmath27 ranges used are @xmath73  for the three centre - of - mass energies , which means the lowest values of @xmath5 probed are about @xmath74 .",
    "the differential cross - section as a function of @xmath75 is described by the twogam monte carlo at @xmath70 and @xmath71  .",
    "the phojet model gives an adequate description at @xmath76 and @xmath77  , whereas it fails to describe the data at @xmath70  , probably due to the low cut in @xmath27 applied .",
    "the prediction of the qpm is found to be too low at all energies .",
    "the cross - sections predicted by the bfkl calculation are much higher than what is observed and are strongly disfavoured by the data .",
    "a similar analysis was presented by opal  @xcite , based on data at @xmath72  , with average photon virtualities of about @xmath78  , and for @xmath79  .",
    "the differential cross - section is obtained as functions of @xmath27 , @xmath5 and , for @xmath79  and for energies of the scattered electrons larger than 65  , and polar angles in the range @xmath80  mrad .",
    "the measured cross - section in this region is @xmath81  pb , compared to the predicted cross - sections of @xmath82  pb for phojet and @xmath83  pb based on the bfkl calculation in leading/higher order. also for opal the data are described by the phojet model and there is no room for large additional contributions .",
    "the precision of the results is limited by statistics and they can be improved by using the full statistics of the lep2 programme .",
    "many new results on the qed and qcd structure of the photon have been obtained in the last years .      for the measurement of the hadronic structure function",
    "considerable progress has been made concerning the problem of the inaccurate modelling of the hadronic final state by the monte carlo models .",
    "new results on the low-@xmath5 behaviour of  have been presented and by now the evolution of  with  is probed up to @xmath84  .",
    "interesting studies on the hadronic structure of the exchange of two virtual photons have been performed .",
    "the effective structure function has been measured at lep and its behaviour can be described by the next - to - leading order prediction .",
    "the cross - section for the exchange of two highly virtual photons can be described with conventional models , whereas the present bfkl predictions are strongly disfavoured by the data .",
