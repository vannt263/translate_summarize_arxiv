    "nowadays , one of the main problems of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the problem of glueball  a controversial object whose existence is fully admitted , though details of its model are still under question .",
    "glueball represents a model for a new hadron which is created by self - interacting gluonic fields . in a sense ,",
    "a glueball can be imagined as a blob of gluonic fields , and this causes difficulties in working with the model .",
    "particularly , the model of glueball can be described only in the realm of qcd , since in this case we deal with gluonic fields .",
    "the non  dimensional coupling constant of su(3 ) nonabelian gauge theory is the base for qcd , and the latter being strongly nonlinear theory requires the constant to be greater than 1 .",
    "thus , mathematically , this condition stipulates that we can not use feynman diagram method , namely , the perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "the matter is that the method can be used only in case of weak interactions , in which dimensionless coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the problem lies in that for description of the model we must use non - perturbative methods of quantum field theory .",
    "for example , in ref s @xcite the authors consider the glueball decay rates in the witten - sakai - sugimoto model , a holographic top - down approach for qcd with chiral quarks in witten s holographic model of nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory .    at the present time , experimental search of lightest glueball is conducted based on assessments of its mass , which lies in the range of 10001700 mev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the experimental and theoretical status of glueball ) .",
    "although , it is necessary to mention that experimental search did not reveal any strong evidence of existence of glueball .    in ref s",
    "@xcite an approximated approach was proposed for the non - perturbative quantisation in qcd . in this approach given su(3 ) lagrangian is turned into lagrangian of two scalar fields using some assumptions .",
    "these fields describe two and four point green functions entering the initial lagrangian .",
    "hence , we obtain simplified description of gluonic fields in the form of two scalar fields .",
    "a glueball is a hypothetical composite particle that consists solely of non - abelian su(3 ) gauge field , without valence quarks .",
    "the existence of a glueball is consequence of the self - interaction of gluons within quantum chromodynamics .",
    "nonlinear self - interaction of gluons in qcd leads to possibility of the existence of a color - neutral state made of gluons only , which was called glueball .",
    "glueball is also thought as a bound state of gluons , and it s properties can not be described within a perturbative approach to qcd .",
    "glueball remains an obscure object over thirty years after qcd was used to predict such a state .",
    "it is well known that the gluon condensate , from which glueball is thought to be made of , can only be determined in a nonperturbative formulation of qcd .",
    "so far various attempts have been made to determine gluon condensate from first principles @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "our main idea is to write an effective lagrangian .",
    "this lagrangian is obtained from the lagrangian of su(3 ) non - abelian gauge theory . in order to do this , we first separate su(3 ) color degrees of freedom into two parts : subgroup  su(2 ) @xmath1 su(3 ) and coset su(3)/su(2 ) .",
    "then we average the su(3 ) lagrangian using some assumptions and approximation .",
    "our approximation is based on the main assumption that the 2 and 4-points green s functions are described in terms of some scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 due to the following relations : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are su(2 ) indices , @xmath6 are coset indices , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are closure constants .",
    "similarly , we see that for turbulence modeling we have to introduce some closure constants .",
    "an effective lagrangian then becomes @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dimesionless coupling constant ; @xmath11 , @xmath8 are some parameters ; the signature of the spacetime metrics is @xmath12 .",
    "the effective lagrangian is an approximation to the nonperturbatively quantized su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "quantities entering the lagrangian have the following meanings and origins :    * the scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 describe nonperturbatively quantized su(2 ) and coset su(3)/su(2 ) degrees of freedom , correspondingly ; * the terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the result of the nonperturbative quantum averaging of @xmath15 in the initial su(3 ) lagrangian ; * the terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the result of the nonperturbative quantum averaging of @xmath18 ; * the term @xmath19 is the result of the nonperturbative quantum averaging of @xmath20 ; * @xmath8 appear to be closure coefficients ; * the terms @xmath21 , @xmath22 arise due to the closure coefficients @xmath8 .    using the lagrangian",
