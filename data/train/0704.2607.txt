    "clusters of galaxies form from the highest peaks in the primordial spectrum of density perturbations generated by inflation in the early universe .",
    "they are the most massive virialized structures in the universe , and as such are rare objects .",
    "the number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is strongly dependent on a number of cosmological parameters . in particular , counting the abundance of clusters above some lower mass limit as a function of cluster redshift places constraints on @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "observational measurement of the cluster abundance over large sky areas and redshift range is required to generate cosmological parameter constraints which are complementary to constraints from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , type ia supernovae , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the lyman-@xmath12 forest , and galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "cluster survey yields depend on the value of the minimum cluster luminosity probed as a function of redshift , the scaling between cluster luminosity and mass , the growth function of structure , and the redshift evolution of the comoving volume element , all of which depend on a complex combination of cosmological parameters @xcite and intracluster medium ( icm ) physics @xcite .      the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite is a process by which the hot electrons trapped in the large dark matter potential wells of clusters inverse compton scatter cmb photons to higher energy , resulting in a low frequency ( @xmath13 218 ghz ) decrement , and a corresponding high frequency ( @xmath4 218 ghz ) increment in the cmb on the angular scale of the cluster .",
    "the strength of the sze decrement / increment is characterized by the compton @xmath14 parameter , which results from the line of sight integral of the thermal pressure @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron density and @xmath17 is the gas electron temperature .",
    "we also define the integrated compton @xmath14 parameter as @xmath18 which is the integration over the area subtended by a circle corresponding to some relevant cluster physical radius .",
    "the observed temperature fluctuation corresponding to a give value of @xmath14 in a given frequency band is @xmath19 where @xmath20,\\ ] ] @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a relativistic correction as described in @xcite . for our purposes in this paper",
    "we have neglected the relativistic correction , but will explore it in future work .",
    "this correction is small ( less than 1% at the maximum decrement frequency ) for clusters with t @xmath13 10 kev .",
    "the sze is particularly useful in cosmological studies due to its near redshift independence @xcite .",
    "therefore , observations of clusters are not limited to low redshift as in the x - ray , but can extend to as high as z @xmath0 2 , where the number of massive clusters becomes small .",
    "an additional consequence of the redshift independence of sze surveys is that a flux - limited survey is also approximately a mass limited survey @xcite .",
    "these two properties make sze surveys uniquely valuable for cluster abundance counts and determination of the cluster mass function with redshift , provided one can obtain independent optical redshifts for the galaxies in the identified objects .",
    "the near redshift independence of the sze creates unique complications for large area surveys which do not seriously affect other types of surveys ( e.g. , optical and x - ray ) .",
    "in particular , the contribution to the sky signal from both low mass and distant halos , as well as unbound gas , may be a significant source of confusion .",
    "there are several upcoming millimeter wavelength cluster surveys with new telescopes including the atacama pathfinder experiment sunyaev - zeldovich survey ( apex - sz ) @xcite , the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite , and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite , in addition to the space - based _ planck _",
    "surveyor @xcite , which will conduct large blind surveys of clusters using the sze .",
    "table [ sz_inst ] shows the values of the relevant instrumental characteristics for the single - dish survey telescopes we have taken from the literature and used in the following analysis . for this study , we limit ourselves to results using a single band , @xmath0144 ghz , where the sze decrement is maximal , though these results will generalize to other bands and to multiwavelength studies , since the sze from all gas will have roughly the same spectral signature ( modified slightly by relativistic effects ) .",
    "however , for removing contaminating signals ( e.g. radio point sources , cmb ) multiwavelength coverage will be very desirable .",
    "the variation in survey characteristics for these instruments has important consequences for cluster surveys .",
    "for example , the distribution of sources detected as a function of cluster redshift should be different for each survey .",
    "this is because although the sze surface brightness does not diminish with distance , the angular size of the objects does vary with redshift , and may be larger or smaller than the instrument beam for any given cluster .",
    "this selection effect is modified also by the volume sampled as a function of redshift in a fixed angular field and the growth rate of structure in an @xmath23cdm universe .",
    "it is important to understand these selection effects in order to constrain cosmology",
    ". we must be able to determine the correct distribution of clusters as a function of redshift from the surveys or systematic errors in estimated cosmological parameters will result .",
    ".characteristics of upcoming sze surveys [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sz_inst ]    there are also several centimeter wave ( @xmath2430 ghz ) interferometers that are performing surveys of the sze , such as the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) @xcite and the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) @xcite .",
    "sze surveys have the potential to strongly constrain the @xmath11 parameter for dark energy , since they sample clusters to large redshift .",
    "determining the abundance and distribution in mass and redshift of massive galaxy clusters from observables is a challenging exercise . in the realm of cluster abundance counts",
    ", one needs to know with high precision the mass range of clusters probed in a flux - limited survey as a function of cluster redshift .",
    "this determination depends on detailed knowledge of the scaling between mass and light in clusters .",
    "it is critical to understand how cluster observables correlate with cluster total mass in order to use clusters of galaxies as precision cosmological tools .",
    "recent results indicate that high resolution n - body simulations @xcite generate mass functions which differ significantly from the press - schechter result and also from the subsequent modifications of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since there is strong evidence that purely analytic methods are insufficient , `` precision cosmology '' requires the use of numerical simulations . in other words , in order to make predictions which match the observed cluster population to percent - level precision , analytic methods are inadequate .",
    "the output of numerical simulations of clusters can be compared to the observed cluster mass function .",
    "this comparison is non - trivial , however , due to the uncertain nature of the conversion between observable quantities ( e.g. , x - ray luminosity , sze compton y parameter , lensing shear ) and cluster total mass .",
    "observations of the cluster gas typically depend on the detailed properties of the hot baryons in clusters .",
    "it has been shown by our group and others that cluster observables have a strong dependence on the baryonic physics in the icm @xcite , and are subject to an array of uncertainties .",
    "however , the sze signal integrated over the projected cluster area ( as defined in equation 2 ) inside @xmath25 is unique in that the general scaling with mass is relatively independent of the assumed gas physics @xcite . while the normalization of the y - m relation has some dependence on icm physics , the slope and tightness of the correlation",
    "are unaffected @xcite .",
    "most recent simulated light cone calculations use the dark matter mass function generated by large n - body simulations like the hubble volume simulation or the millennium run , with `` painted on '' baryons to generate mock surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies typically assume the gas is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter potential .",
    "both simulations including relevant physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and high resolution x - ray observations of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that many clusters depart strongly from both equilibrium and isothermality .",
    "these deviations can have a strong impact on both the observable and derived properties of clusters .",
    "thus , in order to properly simulate sky surveys , it is critically important to self - consistently include baryons in numerical simulations . while some work has been done in this area ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the largest volumes simulated were small ( @xmath0100 - 200 h@xmath26mpc ) , and only sufficient to generate synthetic light cones of roughly 1 - 4 deg@xmath27 .",
    "the simulation performed for this study models a significantly larger physical volume than previous efforts , has a higher peak physical resolution , and fully incorporates baryons self - consistently .",
    "this allows us to perform much larger synthetic surveys ( @xmath0100 deg@xmath28 ) than could be done with earlier n - body / hydro simulations .",
    "cosmological n - body / hydro simulations have advanced significantly in the last decade , such that the simulation output now compares quite well to observations of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "in particular , our group and others have shown that there is good agreement in simulated and observed scaling relations between bulk cluster icm properties ( e.g. , cluster mass , x - ray luminosity , x - ray spectral temperature ) @xcite .",
    "there remain important differences , particularly for lower mass clusters , which indicates the need for a better understanding of the details of baryonic cluster physics .",
    "the advance of realism in simulations is a result of diligent , iterative efforts by various groups of investigators to directly compare simulations to observations .",
    "this study uses a large volume high resolution adiabatic simulation , and serves as a template for more complex runs involving additional non - gravitational physical processes which are likely important to accurately modeling cluster surveys .",
    "these results should be relatively robust in any case , as it has been shown that sze survey yields are relatively independent of cluster physics details @xcite .",
    "a variety of approaches have been taken to model sze surveys .",
    "most involve either semi - analytic prescriptions or n - body simulations where the gas is added in a post processing step ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in the previous section , there are limitations to these methods , particularly in the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality .",
    "some studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have discussed the contribution of unresolved clusters / groups to the signature of detected clusters .",
    "the presence of gas outside the cluster virial radii in low density unbound structures such as filaments is potentially also quite important .",
    "this gas is completely absent in non - hydrodynamic treatments of the simulation volume , appears naturally in our calculation , and is expected to contain 40 - 50% of the baryons in the universe @xcite .",
    "since the sze does not diminish with distance , and results from a line of sight integral of the gas pressure , the sum of all the flux from unbound gas could be a significant contributor to the total flux in any cluster detection .    in this paper",
    ", we have examined the contribution of line - of - sight baryonic gas to the expected sze signal of simulated clusters .",
    "we have stacked a ( 512 h@xmath26mpc)@xmath1 volume ( comoving ) adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) n - body / hydro simulation to generate a survey of a light cone subtending 100 square degrees on the sky .",
    "our simulated survey covers a larger sky area , and at higher angular resolution , than any previous n - body + hydro simulated survey .",
    "there is extensive work in the literature on cluster detection algorithms for sze surveys , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these methods involve various techniques designed to spatially filter out the primary cmb anisotropies ( so called matched filtering ) , wavelet techniques , and application of public tools such as sextractor @xcite .",
    "we find the existing work to be quite detailed , and do not introduce new algorithms of this type here .",
    "indeed , it is important to step back from the analyses which have attempted to include all the relevant contaminants and instrumental effects and explore the intrinsic difficulties resulting from the cluster population as projected on the sky . there is a limiting precision one can expect from cluster surveys irrespective of the ability to remove instrumental effects , point source confusion and sky backgrounds .",
    "this limit results from the possibly irreducible confusion due to clusters , groups , lower mass halos and unbound gas , all of which contribute to the sze signal with a nearly identical spectral signature .",
    "this study examines these effects with a more realistic cosmological calculation than has typically been done , including the full complement of baryons expected in the real universe .",
    "we explore the intrinsic limitations of sze surveys by comparing and characterizing the contribution of unresolved halos and unbound filamentary gas to the cluster signal in samples that might result from upcoming surveys using a full hydro / n - body simulation of the cluster sky . in future work , we will model backgrounds and instrumental characteristics as has been done in the literature recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a focus on techniques for accurately extracting cluster properties and abundance .",
    "we discuss our methodology of simulating these large surveys in section 2 , analytic predictions of sze observables in section 3 , present results in section 4 , discussion in section 5 , and summarize our work in section 6 .",
    "` enzo ' is a publicly available , extensively tested adaptive mesh refinement cosmology code developed by greg bryan and colleagues @xcite .",
    "the specifics of the enzo code are described in detail in these papers ( and references therein ) , but we present a brief description here for clarity .",
    "the enzo code couples an n - body particle - mesh ( pm ) solver @xcite used to follow the evolution of a collisionless dark matter component with an eulerian amr method for ideal gas dynamics by @xcite , which allows high dynamic range in gravitational physics and hydrodynamics in an expanding universe .",
    "this amr method ( referred to as _ structured _ amr ) utilizes an adaptive hierarchy of grid patches at varying levels of resolution . each rectangular grid patch ( referred to as a `` grid '' )",
    "covers some region of space in its _ parent grid _ which requires higher resolution , and can itself become the parent grid to an even more highly resolved _ child grid_. enzo s implementation of structured amr places no fundamental restrictions on the number of grids at a given level of refinement , or on the number of levels of refinement .",
    "however , owing to limited computational resources it is practical to institute a maximum level of refinement , @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , the enzo amr implementation allows arbitrary integer ratios of parent and child grid resolution , though in general for cosmological simulations ( including the work described in this paper ) a refinement ratio of 2 is used .",
    "since the addition of more highly refined grids is adaptive , the conditions for refinement must be specified . in enzo",
    ", the criteria for refinement can be set by the user to be a combination of any or all of the following : baryon or dark matter overdensity threshold , minimum resolution of the local jeans length , local density gradients , local pressure gradients , local energy gradients , shocks , and cooling time .",
    "a cell reaching any or all of the user - specified criteria will then be flagged for refinement .",
    "once all cells of a given level have been flagged , rectangular solid boundaries are determined which minimally encompass them .",
    "a refined grid patch is then introduced within each such bounding volume , and the results are interpolated to a higher level of resolution .",
    "in enzo , resolution of the equations being solved is adaptive in time as well as in space .",
    "the timestep in enzo is satisfied on a level - by - level basis by finding the largest timestep such that the courant condition ( and an analogous condition for the dark matter particles ) is satisfied by every cell on that level .",
    "all cells on a given level are advanced using the same timestep .",
    "once a level @xmath30 has been advanced in time @xmath31 , all grids at level @xmath32 are advanced , using the same criteria for timestep calculations described above , until they reach the same physical time as the grids at level @xmath30 . at this point grids at level @xmath32 exchange baryon flux information with their parent grids ,",
    "providing a more accurate solution on level @xmath30 .",
    "cells at level @xmath32 are then examined to see if they should be refined or de - refined , and the entire grid hierarchy is rebuilt at that level ( including all more highly refined levels ) .",
    "the timestepping and hierarchy rebuilding process is repeated recursively on every level to the maximum existing grid level in the simulation .",
    "two different hydrodynamic methods are implemented in enzo : the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) @xcite , which was extended to cosmology by @xcite , and the hydrodynamic method used in the zeus magnetohydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "we direct the interested reader to the papers describing both of these methods for more information , and note that ppm is the preferred choice of hydro method since it is higher - order - accurate and is based on a technique that does not require artificial viscosity , which smoothes shocks and can smear out features in the hydrodynamic flow .      the simulation discussed in this paper",
    "is set up as follows .",
    "we initialize our calculation at @xmath33 assuming a cosmological model with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) , @xmath39 , and using an @xcite power spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath40 .",

    "the equations of hydrodynamics were solved with the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) using the dual energy formalism .",
    "the entire grid hierarchy ( including both particle and baryon information ) was written out at regular intervals , and in particular , data was output at intervals of @xmath49 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( inclusive ) , and @xmath52 between @xmath51 and @xmath53 ( inclusive ) .    analysis was performed on every data output between @xmath50 and @xmath53 in an identical way .",
    "the hop halo - finding algorithm @xcite was applied to the dark matter particle distribution to produce a dark matter halo catalog .",
    "spherically - averaged , mass - weighted radial profiles of various baryonic and dark matter quantities including density , temperature , and pressure were then generated for every halo in the catalog with an estimated halo mass greater than @xmath54  m@xmath43 .",
    "these radial profiles were used to calculate more accurate virial masses and radii as well as an estimate for the compton @xmath14 parameter as a function of impact parameter on the halo .",
    "projections of the integrated compton @xmath14 value along the line of sight were created for each of the three axes along the simulation volume , with two projections per axis ",

    ". this scaling may involve tiling ( for redshifts where 512 h@xmath26 mpc comoving corresponds to less than @xmath58 on the sky ) or interpolating ( for redshifts where 512 h@xmath26 mpc comoving corresponds to more than @xmath58 on the sky ) .",
    "secondary maps are created which include only the compton @xmath14 parameter contributed by gas within the virial radius of halos with masses above @xmath59  m@xmath43 , and only gas outside of the virial radius of these objects .",

    "what is also of interest in this analysis is the size of the variance shown by the 90% range error bars .",
    "on 100 square degree patches of the sky at @xmath113 the deduced power can be different by factors of 5 - 8 .",

    "this work also includes the additional flux contributed by unbound gas , which contributes at some level in the real universe , but has been ignored in most simulations of sze surveys .",
    "while there are several definitions of confusion in the literature , even for sze surveys , we have chosen to define cluster confusion as the number of true cluster- or group - mass objects in the simulation whose centers are within the source region in projection .",
    "since upcoming sze surveys are unlikely to detect cluster gas out to the virial radius , we have chosen a smaller radius ( @xmath25 ) as the source region .",
    "for each of the upcoming surveys , we have defined the source region as a radius of a full beam diameter , presuming that if two objects were imaged by two separate non - overlapping beams , that there is a possibility they would not be confused .",
    "this also presumes that the secondary object is bright enough to be detected on its own .",
    "one can also define confusion as an error in recovered flux @xcite from sources found by progressive matched filtering at different angular scales corresponding to variation of the angular size of clusters as a function of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    whether this type of confusion can be mitigated depends on a variety of factors , including the mass of the additional secondary objects in the source region , redshift distribution and angular scale of the objects and the observing beam and multiple wavelength identfication of the objects ( e.g. , optical , x - ray , lensing ) .",
    "we endeavor here then simply to characterize the amount of said confusion , leaving the mitigation of this problem to future work .",
    "figure [ all_source ] shows for each of the surveys considered a histogram of the number of objects above 10@xmath123 in the source regions ( as defined above ) of all clusters with m @xmath124 .",
    "these mass limits are chosen somewhat arbitrarily , though for the ground - based surveys , @xmath125 is close to the expected mass limit .",
    "@xmath117 is chosen for the contaminating objects on the expectation that one or more object above that mass in the source region should lead to a significant bias in the sze flux from that expected from a single cluster in the detectable mass range .",
    "as in section 4.3 , we have identified each cluster by its projected image plane position associated with its true three - dimensional location in the simulation after stacking .",
    "it is clear that for planck , there are a high number of objects per source region above this relatively high mass .",
    "in fact , roughly 40% of source regions have only one object above this mass cut , while nearly 60% have more than one .",
    "contrast this result with that of apex / spt , where 95% of source regions have only one massive cluster projected into them .",
    "this result is clearly correlated directly with beam size , but also depends weakly on sensitivity , since a deeper survey will lead to larger source regions ( when limited by signal - to - noise ) and will increase the chance of objects overlapping into the source , and can also increase `` bridging '' between sources .",
    "also , it is likely that sze experiments will sometimes detect a source where there is no cluster in the mass range at that location ( spurious detections )",
    ". therefore our estimates shown in figure [ all_source ] may be optimistic .     per source region for each of survey modified light cones .",
    "source region is defined as inside @xmath25 projected for the solid line , and as within 1 beam diameter ( at 144 ghz ) distance for each of the survey instruments listed .",
    "cluster identifications for all 200 light cones are tallied and used in the fraction.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      one possibly significant difference between this and other similar simulation - based studies is the inclusion of adiabatic hydrodynamics in addition to n - body dynamics in the calculation .",
    "this results in several advantages over n - body calculations that include the effects of baryons in the post - processing phase .",
    "the first is that our clusters need not be in hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) which is a standard assumption in dark matter - only simulations which have been post - processed .",
    "both simulations and observations indicate that hydrostatic equilibrium is not a safe assumption for many clusters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a significant amount of scatter in cluster observables results from the disequilibrium caused by mergers @xcite .",
    "this scatter is absent in n - body + hse type studies , and is naturally included in our work .",
    "secondly , our simulations include baryons which are outside virialized objects , including gas in filaments and voids .",
    "the sze in particular is sensitive to this additional gas , since the effect is only linear in the gas density and is relatively redshift independent .",
    "thus any gas along the line of sight contributes to the sze integral , and is not diminished by distance .    while several authors have noted that the angular power in the sze from the cluster subtracted field is small ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not necessarily true that the total sze flux ( or decrement ) from unresolved halos and unbound gas is negligible .",
    "figure [ sz_lc ] shows an image of the full field of light cone in projected compton @xmath14 parameter next to an image of the field where clusters with m @xmath126 have been removed from the field .",
    "we show in figure [ power_noc ] the angular power from the sze in the cluster subtracted images compared to the power due to the full sze image . at small scales ( @xmath127 5000 ) , the power in the cluster subtracted image is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of the full image . at larger scales , however , the difference narrows , and in fact the 90% variance overlaps for the two in some regions .",
    "this is likely due partly to incomplete cluster subtraction in the image .",
    "halos are subtracted ( dashed line ) .",
    "dotted lines indicate 90% variance range for the 200 independent stacking realizations of the light cone images.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a significant result from this analysis is that roughly one third of the sze flux in the image comes from objects with m @xmath128 and filamentary structures made up of gas in the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) phase .",
    "figure [ szy_histo ] shows a histogram for 200 independent light cone realizations from our simulations of the ratio of the total sze flux ( or integrated compton @xmath14 parameter ) in the 100 deg@xmath27 field from only gas within the virial radius of those clusters to that of all other gas in the field .",
    "thus , we predict that upcoming sze instruments are the only near - term telescopes that will possibly be capable of detecting whim over large sky areas .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite , who have performed a similar study with a fixed grid n - body / hydro simulation with considerably lower peak resolution ( 195 h@xmath26 kpc ) than our work .",
    "it is important to note that in an adiabatic simulation , gas fractions are relatively constant with cluster / group mass . in the real universe , as well as in more realistic simulations such as those we performed for @xcite ,",
    "the icm gas radiatively cools and forms stars , lowering the gas fraction of the cluster , and effectively attenuating its sze signal .",
    "this effect is also cluster - mass dependent , lower mass objects have comparatively lower gas fractions . within a simulation with radiative cooling and star formation prescriptions , we find gas fractions 30 - 50% lower in clusters with m @xmath129 than the average value for clusters with m @xmath130 .",
    "additionally , recent observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) point out that gas fractions deduced from x - ray data decrease with cluster temperature ( therefore with mass ) , by of order 50% for 1 - 2 kev clusters from a flat value above @xmath04 kev .",
    "therefore we expect our result here to be an upper limit on the amount of flux from low mass objects and whim gas , possibly above the true value by as much as a factor of two .",
    "our future light cone simulations will be run with non - gravitational physics , and we will explore the effect on the sze background .     and from images with clusters subtracted .",
    "the histogram is generated from 200 independent realizations of the light cone using the same simulation .",
    "roughly two thirds of the flux in the image comes from clusters with m@xmath131 , and the other third comes from the whim and poor groups.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      since unresolved halos ( m @xmath132 ) and unbound gas in this simulation clearly contribute flux to the image , it is important to ask how much additional flux per source is added .",
    "this extra flux is a bias , in that it is always additive",
    ". therefore it should boost the emission of all clusters in the field by some amount which may vary from cluster to cluster , adding both bias and scatter to the cluster sze observable .",
    "this effect is critical to understand , since photometric accuracy of the sze in clusters is key to calibrating a y - m relationship which will be useful in determining cosmological paramteters .",
    "the precision of the calibration of the y - m relationship depends strongly on its scatter @xcite .",
    "figure [ whim_ratio ] shows the ratio of the integrated compton @xmath14 parameter inside a cylinder of radius @xmath25 around each cluster above 10@xmath133 from the cluster subtracted image to the value for the full image .",
    "the plot shows values for clusters in a single light cone image , but there is very little variation in the mean , median and scatter across all the realizations .",
    "the large scatter is partly a result of incomplete subtraction of the cluster sze signature from the image , but also results from variations in large scale structure in the various source regions .",
    "what is clear from the plots is that there is a systematic bias in integrated compton @xmath14 resulting from low mass objects and unbound gas .",

    "it is unclear that this bias is reducible , since identifying objects of very low mass in source fields , particularly at high redshift , seems prohibitively difficult .",
    "additionally , making direct observation of filamentary gas , particularly to locate its position on the sky , has been nearly impossible .     inside a cylinder projected to @xmath25 from the cluster - subtracted image to integrated compton @xmath14 from the same projected cylinder in the full light cone image .",
    "includes all clusters projected into the survey image which have m @xmath137 .",

    "depending on how much of the cluster s radial extent is sampled , the mean value for all clusters will change .",
    "the scatter though , is quite large , which means that accounting for this flux is not as simple as removing a uniform background from each cluster s sze signal . in our study",
    "we also performed the identical analysis for the clusters , assuming detection out to @xmath138 , and found no change in the scatter , though the mean value of the additional flux dropped to roughly 8 - 10% .",
    "as discussed in previous sections , a more realistic modeling of the heating and cooling in the icm should result in a reduction in this additional flux ( or decrement ) by as much as 30 - 50% . even with a reduction of this size , we still expect it to be a few percent to 10% effect with of order @xmath13630 - 40% scatter , creating challenges for a percent - level calibration of the y - m relationship .",
    "in this study , we have taken an important step missing from previous work in the literature on characterizing selection functions of sze surveys . in earlier work",
    ", investigators have attempted to evaluate methods of removing contamination of the galaxy cluster sze signal due to the cmb and other point sources and backgrounds .",
    "however , they have included only the baryons present in clusters and groups , and artificially inserted the gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter distribution from an n - body only simulation . here",
    ", we have explored the often neglected contribution of gas in low mass halos and unbound filamentary gas in aggregate to determine the effect on the cluster signal at a single frequency .",
    "the presence of gas outside the cluster virial radii in low density structures such as filaments is potentially an important contributor to the cluster sze signal .",
    "this gas is completely absent in non - hydrodynamic treatments , but appears naturally in our calculation . since the sze does not diminish with distance and results from a line of sight integral of the gas pressure , the sum of all the flux from unbound gas could be a significant contributor to the total flux in any cluster detection .",
    "additionally , our simulation includes the cluster gas in the full array of dynamically active states .",
    "though the integrated sze is less sensitive to cluster - cluster merging than an x - ray observation would be , merging contributes non - zero scatter to the y - m relationship .",
    "thus , for all these reasons it is critically important to self - consistently include baryons in numerical simulations in order to properly simulate sky surveys .",
    "we have shown that on 100 square degree patches of the sky at @xmath139 or so the deduced power can be different by factors of 5 - 8 .",
    "this indicates that the power spectrum can be quite different from one area of the sky to another , and clearly requires much larger angular areas to be well constrained .",
    "the effect of cosmic variance does not become very small until @xmath140 a few thousand .",
    "we have shown that projection effects can create a large bias and additional scatter in the value of y measured for clusters of galaxies . for clusters of m @xmath243.0@xmath510@xmath123 ,",
    "the median bias in y due to projection is 79% , and the scatter is + 32%/-16% about that median , a significant increase over the scatter in the true y - m relationship .",
    "additionally , we have shown that the contribution of low - mass unresolved halos and unbound gas to the flux ( or decrement ) of identified sources can be significant in some cases , and certainly varies widely from source to source .",
    "we find that there is a contribution from gas outside clusters of @xmath134% per object on average for upcoming surveys .",
    "this indicates both a bias and an additional source of scatter in the determination of the true sze signal from any given cluster . as identified by other studies , errors in extracting the correct value of y",
    "should dominate the error budget for the y - m relation .",
    "this effect is critical to understand , since photometric accuracy of the sze in clusters is key to calibrating a y - m relationship which can be useful for the precision determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "while the intrinsic y - m relation has very small scatter , what matters in practice is the ability to determine the value of y accurately .",
    "the precision of the calibration of the y - m relationship depends strongly on its scatter .",
    "we also show results from an analysis of the source confusion for each instrument based on how many massive ( m @xmath141 m@xmath7 ) clusters lie within an identified source region ( within a radius of @xmath25 or a beam diameter at 144 ghz ) .",
    "it appears that pure cluster / group confusion in these surveys will be a significant problem , particularly for planck surveyor , but also to a lesser extent for the other single - dish surveys .",
    "smaller beam surveys ( @xmath01@xmath3 ) have more than one massive cluster within a beam diameter 5 - 10% of the time , and a larger beam experiment like planck has multiple clusters per beam 60% of the time .",
    "we may have slightly overestimated the problem , since the use of higher resolution ( shorter wavelength ) bands on some of the survey instruments will help to alleviate this issue . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not accounted for spurious detections which may result in a field with real backgrounds and instrument noise . whether this type of confusion can be mitigated depends on a variety of factors , including the mass of the additional secondary objects in the source region , the redshift distribution and angular scale of the objects and the observing beam , and multiple wavelength identfication of the objects ( e.g. , using optical , x - ray , and lensing measurements ) .",
    "this study uses a large volume , high resolution adiabatic simulation , which serves as a template for more complex runs involving additional non - gravitational physics that is likely important to accurately modeling cluster surveys .",
    "there remain important differences between simulation outputs and cluster observations , particularly for lower mass clusters , which indicates the need for a better understanding of the details of baryonic cluster physics .",
    "in addition , deviations from isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster gas can have a strong impact on both the observable and derived properties of clusters .",
    "it is also important to note that there is some dependence of the sze signal on the details of the icm physics ( heating , cooling , conduction , etc . )",
    "which is not modeled in this work . in future work",
    ", we will explore the impact of this additional physics , modeled self - consistently within the hydrodynamic framework of the simulation code , on a selection of sze clusters from surveys",
    ".    this work will be expanded in future papers by a detailed treatment of the point source confusion and instrumental and observing limitations .",
    "this will include adding to our synthetic surveys the contribution of the cmb , dusty galaxies , agn , and atmospheric foreground .",
    "we are now working on modeling these , in particular for apex - sz and spt , and will then experiment with matched filtering and the use of multiwavelength coverage provided by spt for example to mitigate confusion and remove the atmospheric and cmb signals .",
    "matched filtering is a process by which the images are filtered with a kernel matched to the presumed size and shape of the expected sources in the field . in the case of the sze ,",
    "this procedure filters out information on larger scales where the primary cmb anisotropies will be a source of confusion .",
    "it also maximizes the contrast of the image for the objects at that scale .",
