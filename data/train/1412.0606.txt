    "in recent years there has been increasing interest on the multicritical behavior of disordered systems .",
    "special attention has been given to models with the inclusion of random fields , in the case of disordered magnetic systems , both for theoretical interest and also for its correspondence with the experimental results @xcite . among those models ,",
    "the blume - capel model @xcite and some of it extensions has received a lot of attention .",
    "the blume - capel is itself an extension of the classical ising model for spin-1 which takes into account the effect of a local crystal field anisotropy .",
    "its phase diagram displays a line of continuous transition line which meets a first - order transition line which meet at a tricritical point @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "a particularly interesting question is how such phase diagrams are changed under the effect of quenched randomness @xcite .",
    "because of that , kaufman and kanner @xcite studied the blume - capel model under a random magnetic field and obtained a rich variety of phase diagrams.the effect of random crystal field has been considered by a several authors @xcite . besides the approach adopted , in some of these works the choice of the random crystal field distribution",
    "is also different .",
    "however , in all cases the phase diagrams display a rich behavior with the presence of critical and coexistence lines , as well as many multicritical points and re - entrant phenomena . in their recent work ,",
    "salmon and tapia studied an infinite - range blume - capel under a quenched disorder crystal field following a superposition of two gaussian distribution and classified the phase diagrams according to their topology @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of a special discrete random crystal field distribution was investigated by the pair approximation approach @xcite .",
    "the same type of random crystal field distribution had already been investigated by the real - space renormalization - group approach , as well as by the mean - field approximation @xcite . however , as far as the results can be compared they lead to qualitatively different phase diagrams for low temperature .",
    "for instance , while the pair approximation predicts first - order transitions between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic at zero temperature as in figure 2 of @xcite , the conclusion of the single - site mean - field approximation is that the ground state is always ordered according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) of @xcite .",
    "thus , we decided to investigate this point further by considering an exactly version of the blume - capel model under the random crystal field distribution considered by @xcite . besides , we are also interested in investigate the possible topologies for phase diagrams predicted by this sort of mean - field treatment along the lines of the continuous distribution started by@xcite .",
    "finally , since the re - entrant phenomena in random spin-1 models has attracted some recent interest ( see , for instante , @xcite and references therein ) , our results may give some hint as to what expect in more disordered system as in the case of the blume - capel spin - glass under a random crystal field @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the blume - capel model under the presence of a random crystal field and obtain the basic equations . in section 3",
    "we present the obtained phase diagrams .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "let us consider the infinite - range blume - capel model described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the number of spins and @xmath3 , for all sites @xmath4 .",
    "the first sum runs over all pairs of spins @xmath5 .",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling takes the form @xmath6 to account for the free energy extensivity .",
    "the random crystal fields @xmath7 are quenched variables , independent and identically distributed according to the following probability distribution : @xmath8    as far as we know , the above probability distribution was introduced by branco and boechat @xcite and branco @xcite and has been recently considered by lara @xcite .",
    "the transformation @xmath9 leads to the probability distribution mostly used in the study of the blume - capel in discrete random crystal field as , for instance , in @xcite , but also produces a slight change in the hamiltonian .",
    "the general properties of the phase diagram should not depend on the particular form of the discrete random crystal field distribution .",
    "thus , besides our interest in making comparison with known results ( @xcite ) , another reason for our choice of the probability distribution is the symmetry inherent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probability_function ] ) which can be expressed by :    @xmath10    therefore , in order to determine phase diagrams for fixed values of @xmath11 it is sufficient to consider the domain defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    using the replica method ( see the appendix for details ) ,",
    "we obtain the free - energy density , in units of @xmath14 : @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\left(1-p\\right)t\\ln \\left[1 + 2\\exp(d / t)\\cosh\\left(m / t\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eq : fed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the magnetization .",
    "the equation of state can be obtained by taking the minimum of the above free - energy functional with respect to @xmath18 , which leads to @xmath19    the thermodynamic properties of the model is completely determined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fed ] ) and ( [ eq : mag ] ) which , in turn , reveals clearly the symmetry expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sympd ] ) . for given values of @xmath11 , @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 the physical solution corresponds to the global minima of the free - energy density .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath11 we can determine the @xmath22 phase diagram .",
    "( [ eq : mag ] ) always have a trivial solution corresponding to the paramagnetic phase * p * , with @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding paramagnetic free - energy density is given by @xmath24 -\\left(1-p\\right)t\\ln \\left[1 + 2\\exp(d / t)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : fpara}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides the paramagnetic solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mag ] ) may present distinct non - trivial solutions , corresponding to different ferromagnetic phases .",
    "let us consider the ground state .",
    "for @xmath25 , the free - energy density @xmath26 for the paramagnetic solution becomes @xmath27    apart from the paramagnetic phase , we find two ferromagnetic solutions .",
    "the first type ( * f1 * ) is characterized by @xmath28 , with the free energy density given by : @xmath29 the second type of ferromagnetic solution ( * f2 * ) is given by @xmath30 , with the free energy density given by : @xmath31    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) and ( [ eq : f2 ] ) , we note that @xmath32 wherever the * f2 * phase exists .",
    "moreover , from the analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f0])@xmath33([eq : f2 ] ) we find that the ground state consists of the * f1 * phase for @xmath34 , while for @xmath35 it corresponds to the * f2 * phase . at zero temperature , @xmath36",
    ", we determine a first - order transition between the * f1 * and * f2 * phase at @xmath37 given by @xmath38 therefore , except for @xmath11 strictly equals to 1 the paramagnetic phase is never realized at zero temperature .    in general the @xmath22 phase diagrams for a given value of @xmath11",
    "can be determined numerically from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fed ] ) and ( [ eq : mag ] ) .",
    "however , the stability of the paramagnetic phase can be determined analytically . from this analysis",
    "we can find critical frontiers as well as possible tricritical points .",
    "for this purpose , let us introduce the following parametrization : @xmath39 nearby a continuous transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase , we consider a small magnetization @xmath40 and write a landau - like expansion for the free energy density : @xmath41 the coefficient @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpara ] ) , while the remaining coefficients are given by :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 given by @xmath47 these new parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not independent and can be interpreted as the density of spins @xmath48 in the paramagnetic phase for the pure cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .    a continuous transition line from the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase",
    "is given by @xmath51 from  ( [ eq : parametrization ] ) , one has the following expression for the critical line : @xmath52 which is valid as far as @xmath53 .",
    "as in the pure case @xmath54 , we can find tricritical point when    @xmath55    since the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 are functions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( trough @xmath58 ) and @xmath11 , we find a threshold for the tricriticallity as @xmath59 , which corresponds to a multicritical point when @xmath60 ( sometimes called the last tricritical point ) .",
    "thus , we determine the value @xmath61 such that for @xmath62 there are tricritical points in the @xmath22 phase diagrams .    for @xmath63",
    "the tricritical behavior disappears leaving room to other critical or multicritical behavior as the appearance of critical endpoints .",
    "finally , we can also determine a value of @xmath64 such that the tricritical point coincides with the maximum of the critical line @xmath65 implicitly determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcrit ] ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath66 there are re - entrant phenomena from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phase associated with the tricritical behavior . in the following section we present our results in terms of the @xmath67 phase diagrams .",
    "the phase diagrams were determined by numerically finding the global mininum of the free energy density given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fed ] ) . in general the @xmath22 phase diagrams",
    "consists of continuous transition as well as first - order transitions lines and some special , or multicritical , points .",
    "the pure case , which corresponds to @xmath49 , is well - known to display both first - order as well as continuous transition lines separating the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase .",
    "these lines meet at the so - called tricritical point @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the disordered case , we will no longer discuss the phase diagram for the pure case .",
    "as in similar models , the tricritical behavior is affected by the randomness . besides , the randomness may cause the appearance of ordered critical point , which is the end of the coexistence line between two ordered phases , as well as critical endpoint , which is the end of critical line on a coexistence curve .",
    "following @xcite , we use the following convention in our phase diagrams :    * continuous transition or critical line : continuous line ; * first - order transition line : dotted line ; * tricritical point : located by a black circle ; * ordered critical point : located by an asterisk ; * critical endpoint : located by a black triangle ;    depending on the value of @xmath11 we found essentially three topologically distinct phase diagram in the @xmath22 plane .",
    "the phase diagrams belonging to topology i occurs for @xmath68 .",
    "they present a continuous transition line between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases , as displayed in figure 1 . for low temperatures",
    "there is a first - order order transition line separating distinct ferromagnetic phases * f1 * and * f2*. this line ends at an ordered critical point .",
    "the topology ii phase diagrams appear for @xmath69 .",
    "their general behavior is ilustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ordered ( ferromagnetic ) phases by first - order and continuous transition lines .",
    "for low temperature and @xmath70 there is a critical line between the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic * f2 * phase .",
    "also , for low temperatures and @xmath71 there is a first - order transition between the * * f1**@xmath33*f2 * phases .",
    "these two lines meet at a critical endpoint with a second first - order transition line between the paramagnetic * p * and the * f1 * phase .",
    "this new line ends at another critical endpoint common to the critical line between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases .",
    "finally , this second critical endpoint belongs to a second first - order line between the ferromagnetic phases * f1 * and * f3*. this kind of topology is also characterized by re - entrant effects for intermediate temperatures and @xmath21 slight greater than @xmath72 .",
    "the third type of phase diagrams defines the topology iii .",
    "they are obtained for @xmath73 .",
    "the intermediate to low temperature regime is quite similar to type ii phase diagram .",
    "however , the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic * f1 * phase are separated by a coexistence line at intermediate temperatures and a continuous transition line for higher temperatures .",
    "these two lines meet together at a tricritical point . in this case , for a small @xmath11-window we have reentrant phenomena ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "a typical case of topology iii phase diagram is shown in figure 3 .",
    "an important consequence of the random anisotropy distribution used in the present work is that the paramagnetic phase can not be realized at zero temperature for @xmath11 strictly less than 1 .",
    "thus , in our case there is no phase diagram corresponding to topology i described by @xcite . in particular , our findings",
    "do not reproduce the structure of the phase diagrams obtained by @xcite who find stable paramagnetic phases at zero temperature as can be seen in their figures 1 and 2 .",
    "also , our low temperature results are at variance with those obtained by real - space renormalization group analysis @xcite for low dimensional systems .",
    "perhaps these disagreements are due the mean - field character of our infinite - range model .",
    "we plan to investigate this further in future works .",
    "phase diagram for @xmath75 , corresponding to topology i , displaying a continuous transition and a first - order transition line , as well an ordered critical point . ]     phase diagram for @xmath76 , corresponding to topology ii , with three first - order transition lines ( coexistence of * f1-f2 * , * f1-p * and * f1-f3 * phases ) , and two critical lines separating the paramagnetic from the ordered ferromagnetic . a re - entrant effect is clearly noted in this phase diagram .",
    "it is also shown an ordered critical point and two critical endpoints . ]",
    "phase diagram for @xmath77 , corresponding to topology iii and displaying two first - order transition lines ( coexistence of * f1-f2 * and * f1-p * phases ) , and two critical lines separating the paramagnetic from the ferromagnetic phases * f1 * and * f2*. in this case we have a tricritical point and a critical endpoint . ]",
    "in this work we studied the infinite - range blume - capel model under a quenched random crystal field .",
    "the exact free energy density was determined by means of the replica method .",
    "a variety of rich phase diagrams , displaying critical and coexistence lines as well as ordered critical , tricritical and critical end points was obtained .",
    "these phase diagrams can be classified according to three classes , designated as topologies i , ii and iii , with increasing values of the parameter @xmath0 which is a measure of the crystal field randomness .",
    "topology i is characterized by a continuous critical line separating the high temperature paramagnetic phase from the ordered ferromagnetic phase . for low temperatures we have two ferromagnetic * f1 * and * f2 * phases , which are separated by a first - order transition line ending at an ordered critical point . for topology ii the paramagnetic phase",
    "is separated from the ordered ferromagnetic phases either by critical or coexistence lines . for low temperatures",
    "the critical * * p**@xmath33*f2 * line meet two coexistence lines ( * * f1**@xmath33*f2 * and * * p**@xmath33*f1 * ) at a critical endpoint . on the other hand , for intermediate temperatures",
    "the critical line between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases ends at a second critical endpoint .",
    "this critical endpoint is also the terminus of the * * p**@xmath33*f1 * coexistence line as well as of the * * f1**@xmath33*f3 * coexistence lines which , in turn , ends at a common critical point .",
    "the third class of phase diagram belongs to topology iii .",
    "it is marked by the disappearance of the ferromagnetic * f3 * found in the previous case so that the critical * * f1**@xmath33*f3 * point merge with the * * p**@xmath33**f1**@xmath33*f3 * critical endpoint , giving rise to a tricritical point which is the meeting point of the critical * * p**@xmath33*f1 * boundary with the * * p**@xmath33*f1 * coexistence line . in case of topology ii we always have the possibility of reentrant phase transitions , whereas for topology iii reentrant phenomena can only occur for a narrow window in terms of @xmath11 . it remains to be seen whether these effects are present in more realistic short - range models .",
    "the partial financial support from capes ( brazilian agency ) is acknowledged .",
    "apart from terms which do not contribute in the termodynamic limit we can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_bc ] ) as @xmath78 since we are dealing with a quenched system , the free energy is given by      where @xmath80 denotes the average over the disorder given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : probability_function ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the free energy density is given by @xmath81 in order to compute the averaged free energy ( [ eq : fe ] ) we make use of the replica method @xcite based on the identity @xmath82 writing @xmath83 , \\ ] ] and using the identity          in the large @xmath2 limit the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : znavg ] ) is dominated by the maximum and can be evaluated by the steepest descent method .",
    "since we have equivalent and nointeracting replica the saddle point is given by @xmath88 for any replica @xmath89 .",
    "thus we can finally obtain , for @xmath90 , the asymptotic expression @xmath91 where @xmath92 from which we obtain the free energy in units of @xmath14 ( this is equivalent to taking @xmath93 ) given by eq .",
