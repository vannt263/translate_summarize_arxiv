    "the theory of complex networks has recently produced a great deal of interest in a very multidisciplinary community ( for recent reviews on the field see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been applied with success to a number of fields spanning from the internet and the world - wide web @xcite to protein interactions in cells @xcite .",
    "the study of human society is another topic where networks can play an important role . in this particular case ,",
    "the vertices represent individuals and the edges social interactions such as professional , friendship , or family relationships .",
    "these interactions can appear on different levels of intensity .",
    "how strength our friendship with other person is can not be seen as a white - and - black concept but as a full scale of colors .",
    "this means that the best networks to characterize social interactions are weighted graphs .",
    "weighted graphs include a magnitude associated to the edges , a so - called _ weight _ , that accounts for the quality of each connection @xcite . here",
    "i will apply the mathematical tools designed for weighted graphs to collaborations networks .",
    "so far the major problem for the study of social networks has been the absence of large enough databases from which reliable statistical conclusions could be extracted .",
    "however , on the edge of the digital era , this restriction does no longer exist for a particular kind of social networks , the so called _ collaboration networks_. this type of networks are obtained from public databases containing artistic or scientific productions such as books , movies or papers , together with the names of the people authoring those works .",
    "the network is then formed by connecting together pairs of persons who have co - authored a common work @xcite .",
    "this graph is undirected , the relations are reciprocal , and it may be weighted .",
    "the weights can be used to represent how many times a certain partnership has taken place , maintaining thus a high degree of information in a single graph @xcite . recently , we exploited the information contained in the weights of the links to define a new quantity , the _ social inertia _ , which measures the eagerness of the authors to keep working over and over with the same team @xcite .",
    "my intention in this paper is to study in detail the foundations of this magnitude and to show why it gives new information different from previous metrics . in order to illustrate these points , i will use networks obtained from the imdb movie database @xcite and from condmat @xcite .",
    "the imdb database comprehends @xmath0 actors and @xmath1 movies , while the data from condmat contains @xmath2 authors and @xmath3 papers .",
    "let us start by considering a network where the nodes are authors or actors , the edges represent partnerships and the weight of the edges , @xmath4 for a link between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the number of times a co - authorship between authors @xmath5 and @xmath6 has been repeated .",
    "the degree of a node @xmath5 , the number of connections @xmath7 , corresponds to the number of different coauthors a particular actor has had .",
    "another important magnitude is the strength @xmath8 , which is the sum over all the weights of the links of node @xmath5 . in our case",
    ", @xmath8 is the total number of partnerships @xmath5 had . the social inertia for @xmath5 is then defined as @xmath9 and accounts for how many of the partnerships have taken place with different partners . @xmath10",
    "measures the level of conservatism of @xmath5 , how open he or she is to collaborate with different people .",
    "its limits are @xmath11 if the actor has never repeated collaborators , and @xmath12 if all her works were carried out with the same team , where @xmath13 stands for the total experience of @xmath5 ( number of works she has authored ) .",
    ", for the movie network ( main plot ) and condmat ( inset ) .",
    "the red line in the main plot corresponds to a power law with exponent @xmath14 and the one in the inset to an exponent @xmath15 ( the limit to have finite second moment ) .",
    "the b ) plot contains the distribution of values of inertia for nodes with a given value of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in the actor network.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , for the movie network ( main plot ) and condmat ( inset ) .",
    "the red line in the main plot corresponds to a power law with exponent @xmath14 and the one in the inset to an exponent @xmath15 ( the limit to have finite second moment ) .",
    "the b ) plot contains the distribution of values of inertia for nodes with a given value of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in the actor network.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the inertia is the average weight of the links of a node , @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the set of @xmath7 neighbors of @xmath5 .",
    "if we consider a network where all the weights are alike , the inertia is a constant .",
    "unweighted graphs are a particular case of this situation with @xmath20 for all @xmath5 .",
    "if there exist a weight distribution in the graph @xmath21 , then the values allowed to @xmath22 depend on how wide such distribution is . for distributions with a finite second moment and for nodes with high degrees @xmath16",
    ", the central limit theorem implies that their strengths must show a gaussian distribution around a central value @xmath23 and that the deviation of this distribution should grows as @xmath24 with the degree .",
    "this leads in turn to a gaussian distribution of the fluctuations of the inertia of nodes with the same degree @xmath16 , with the standard deviation decreasing with the degree as @xmath25 .",
    "in other words : the inertia should be better and better determined , the larger the degree of a node becomes .",
    "if the degree of a node is known , there remains almost no uncertainty in its value of the inertia ( specially if its degree is high ) .",
    "this argument seems to establish that the inertia is a magnitude dependent of others as the degree , but is it really like that in real - world networks ?    in order to give an answer to this question ,",
    "i have plotted in figure 1a the cumulative weight distribution ( @xmath26 ) for both empirical networks ( actors and condamt ) .",
    "for the two examples , the weight distribution is wide but decays faster than @xmath27 , which implies that these distributions have finite second moments .",
    "however , as can be observed in fig .",
    "1b , the distribution of values of inertia for nodes with a given value of the degree , @xmath28 , does not tend to a gaussian form for high values of @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise , the curves in fig .",
    "1b should tend to a parabola when @xmath16 increases .",
    "this fact is in contradiction with the argument above .",
    "another point of conflict is its final prediction for the inertia : the deviation of the values of @xmath22 for nodes with a certain degree @xmath16 , @xmath29 , does not decay as @xmath30 for any of the networks studied .",
    "instead , it grows for the actor network , see figs .",
    "2a , and remains almost constant for the condamt ( fig .",
    "this leads to a kind of indetermination rule : for the actors , the higher the degree of a node is , the less we know a priori about its possible value of the inertia . and for the condmat , knowing the degree does not tell us anything about the inertia .",
    "the values of the average inertia as a function of the degree is also represented in the same figures and , in contrast to what happens in transport networks @xcite , it does not change significantly .",
    "decay for uncorrelated networks.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   decay for uncorrelated networks.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    one may wonder then what these networks have in particular to show this behavior .",
    "the answer is profusely discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is related to the fact that the weights of the edges are not randomly distributed .",
    "the edges of a node tend in general to be uniform , more than in a purely random distribution .",
    "these correlations imply that nodes with the same degree can have very different values of the strength and consequently vary in the inertia .",
    "weak links are concentrated in certain areas of the network and the same happens with the strong links . to illustrate this mechanism ,",
    "i have disordered the weights of the links : maintaining the same topological structure of the network , the weight of each link is interchanged with that of another randomly chosen edge .",
    "the effect on @xmath29 can be seen in figs .",
    "2a and 2b .",
    "for the randomized networks , the deviation decays as @xmath30 following the prediction done by the argument discussed above for uncorrelated graphs .    from the social perspective",
    ", this effect means that the authors or actors display a tendency towards keeping their partnerships in relative similar levels .",
    "some people are quite faithful and go on repeating with the same collaborators , others change of collaborators with high frequency and do not maintain a partnership for very long .",
    "these are the two extremes but of course there is a full scale of behaviors for the agents in the middle .",
    "however , extreme conducts are here more likely than in a completely random situation .",
    "consequently , even if the number of different partners is the same for two actors , it is not easy to predict to which category they belong .",
    "the difficulty of doing so may even increase with an increasing number of partners .",
    "in summary , i have studied here how the inertia , the average weight , of the nodes relates to other magnitudes in social networks .",
    "a very simple theoretical arguments suggests that knowing a certain magnitude as the degree , one has the inertia of a node specified .",
    "i have checked the validity of this argument in two real - world social networks : the imdb movie database and the condmat . both of these cases show that the theoretical prediction fails .",
    "the reason for the failure is the existence of weight - weight correlations in real networks .",
    "this fact implies that the distribution of the inertia contains important information on the behavior of the agents . from a social point of view , the existence of these correlation indicate the presence of two different type of behaviors .",
    "some agents are faithful to their partners and maintain in average a high level of collaboration with them , while others have a tendency to change quickly their collaborators without allowing the partnerships to go too far ."
