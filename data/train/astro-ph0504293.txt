    "it is generally accepted that only a small fraction ( @xmath4 10% ) of the spin - down energy of a young pulsar is converted into observable pulsed emission , and most of the energy leaves the pulsar in the form of a highly relativistic electron / positron wind .",
    "this relativistic wind eventually interacts ( through a termination shock ) with the external medium , emits synchrotron radiation , and produces a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pulsar wind particles are usually confined by the supernova ejecta or interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the morphology of the pwn relies strongly on how the wind particles are confined .",
    "some pwne ( e.g. , ic 433 , w44 , n157b , b1957 + 20 , b1757 - 24 , duck nebula , mouse , geminga ) have cometary morphologies , which are suggested to be due to the supersonic motion of their respective pulsars in the ism or supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite . in such a system , there is a bow shock running ahead of the pulsar , most of the wind particles are confined to the direction opposite to the pulsar proper motion , and the pulsar is well offset from the center or even at the apex of the pwn @xcite .",
    "detailed spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy of a pwn should be important for examining and refining those models , because the x - ray emitting particles are young and have a short lifetime , and thus the spatial variations of the x - ray spectra reflect very well the particle track and energy evolution in the pwn .",
    "radio and optical observations suggest that the pwn energized by psr b1951 + 32 in snr ctb 80 ( g69.0 + 2.7 ) is an ideal laboratory to study the interaction between an snr and the embedded pwn .",
    "ctb 80 has a peculiar radio morphology composed of three ridges and a @xmath5 core in the southern central portion of the extended component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the 39.5 ms pulsar psr b1951 + 32 , located at the south - western edge of the core , moves towards the south - west ( @xmath6 , north through east ) with a transverse velocity of 240@xmath740 km s@xmath8 for a distance of 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "radio observation revealed a `` @xmath9 '' like loop and a bright bow shock feature at the southwest of the loop , indicating strong interaction of the wind of the fast moving pulsar with the environment @xcite .",
    "the optical structure of the pwn of psr b1951 + 32 was delineated by forbidden - line ( [ o iii ] , [ s ii ] , and [ n ii ] ) emission as shell - like @xcite .",
    "these optical features suggest that they arise behind shocks which are being driven into a magnetized thermal plasma by the confined relativistic wind from psr b1951 + 32 @xcite .",

    "observations show a central filled x - ray source with nonthermal x - ray spectrum ( photon index @xmath10=3.8@xmath11 ) , and the morphology of the source was suggested as a result of the relativistic jets energized by the central pulsar @xcite .",

    "these observational properties are well consistent with those of a pwn . however , due to the limited spatial and spectral resolution of the previous x - ray telescopes , the detailed morphological and spectral structures of the x - ray emission remains not well resolved .",
    "the superb spatial resolution and moderate spectral resolution of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( hereafter _ chandra _ ) permit a detailed morphological study and spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy of psr b1951 + 32 and its pwn .",
    "_ chandra _ can isolate the pulsar from the surrounding nebula and we can then study the spectrum of the pulsar proper , which has not been done so far yet .",

    "acis is sensitive to x - rays in 0.2 - 10 kev with an energy resolution of @xmath20 at 1 kev , and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) is 0@xmath21 .",
    "the frame read out time for this observation is 0.74 s , since only a small portion of the ccd chip was illuminated .",

    "figure 1 shows an acis image of the pwn of psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "this image reveals several major components of the pwn : a point source at ra ( j2000 ) = @xmath22 , dec ( j2000 ) = @xmath23 , a bright elongation lies in the northeast of the point source , a 30@xmath0 diameter plateau with absence in its northwest , and more diffuse emission in between and beyond these features .",

    "the x - ray point source thus represents the x - ray emission from this pulsar .",
    "the x - ray plateau is just within the radio and optical shells @xcite , and therefore corresponds to the main body of the pwn .",
    "the overall structure of the x - ray nebula is similar to the radio structure , as shown in figure 2 , except that the radio nebula is limb - brightened and that the bright x - ray elongation in the northeast is absent in the radio map @xcite .    in order to show the diffuse x - ray emission near the pulsar more clearly , we plot in figure 3 the x - ray counts ( per 0@xmath25 pixel ) profile ( solid line ) along the pulsar proper motion . in this profile",
    "the contribution from the pulsar has been removed by subtracting the convolution of a delta function with the telescope psf .",
    "the psf is energy - weighted and was simulated with _",
    "the dashed line in figure 3 represents the 1.5 ghz radio profile from @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there is high brightness diffuse emission within @xmath132@xmath0 radius from the pulsar .",
    "there is also significant x - ray emission in the radio bow shock region , although the overall trend of the diffuse emission is declining .",
    "according to our analyses of the morphology of the nebula , we divided it into a few regions ( see figure 4 ) , from which we extracted the spectra of various components .",
    "the background used in the spectral analysis of the diffuse features was extracted from two boxes where there are no prominent emission , while the background of the pulsar spectrum was extracted from an annulus centered on the pulsar , with inner and outer radii of 1@xmath21 and 3@xmath0 respectively .",
    "we fitted the spectra of the diffuse features jointly with a power law ( pl ) model by forcing all the spectra to share the same absorbing column density ( @xmath26 ) . as shown in figure 5 , such a model fits the spectra very well .",
    "the resulted @xmath26 is 3.0@xmath27 @xmath28 , and the other parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "as seen in other pwne , these spectra have a trend of softening with distance from the pulsar due to the fast energy - losing of the high energy electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pile up fraction of the pulsar emission was estimated as 6@xmath17 by using _ sherpa _ , and thus the pile up effect was neglected in our analysis of the pulsar spectrum .",
    "we first fitted the pulsar spectrum with a pl model by fixing the column density to 3.0@xmath29 @xmath28 as derived above .",
    "this gives a photon index of 1.74@xmath30 and @xmath31 of 223 with 208 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "we then fitted the spectrum with a power law + blackbody ( pl+bb ) model , and this yields a photon index of 1.63@xmath32 , bb temperature of 0.13@xmath2 kev , and a @xmath31 of 190 with 206 dof .",
    "if we only check the data in 0.5 - 1.5 kev ( to which energy region the bb component contributes ) , the @xmath31 and dof of the spectral fitting with and without the bb component are 61 , 60 and 84 , 62 , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 shows that the substitution of the pl model by the pl+bb model is necessary at a significance level of @xmath34 99.99% . in comparison ,",
    "figure 6 gives the 0.5 - 1.5 kev spectrum of the pulsar fitted with a pl model and a pl+bb model .",
    "the fitted bb flux corresponds to an equivalent emitting radius of 2.2@xmath3 km assuming a distance of 2.0 kpc to the pulsar .    in order to see whether there is any spectral variation in the plateau and in the very outside region surrounding the plateau , we extracted spectra from the 5 quasi - annulus regions defined in figure 7 and fitted them with a pl model using the background identical to that used above .",
    "table 2 lists the spectral fitting results , which show that the edge of the plateau ( rings 1 , 2 , and 3 in table 2 , and so the radio shell region ) has apparently a harder spectrum than the neighboring inner ( the center region ) and outer regions ( the ring 4 ) .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation has been used to estimate how significant the spectrum of the plateau edge is flatter than that of the center region .",
    "we generated 100,000 pairs of random numbers .",
    "in each pair , the first is a random number from a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation of 1.76 and 0.04 , while the second number is from a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation of 1.64 and 0.015 .",
    "the standard deviations are smaller than the errors listed in table 2 since those in table 2 are at 90% significance level .",
    "we found that only 235 out of the 100,000 pairs have their first numbers smaller than the corresponding second numbers .",
    "therefore , the overall spectrum of rings 1 to 3 is flatter than the spectrum of the center region at a significance of 99.7% .",
    "we have also fitted the spectrum of the entire nebula ( excluding the pulsar ) with a power law model .",
    "this gives an @xmath26 of 3.0@xmath27 @xmath28 , a photon index of 1.73@xmath30 , an unabsorbed 0.2 - 10 kev energy flux of 9.6@xmath35 ergs @xmath28 s@xmath8 , and @xmath31 of 296 for 312 dof .",
    "the radio and x - ray spectra of the pwn can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength in the nebula .",
    "the radio emission of this pwn has a flat spectrum of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and flux of @xmath13500 mjy @xcite .",
    "from @xmath16 3.2 we inferred these two values for the x - ray emission as 0.73 and 1 @xmath38jy , respectively .",
    "therefore the spectral break frequency @xmath39 between the radio and x - ray band is around 10@xmath40 hz . assuming that this spectral break arises from synchrotron losses , the magnetic field in the nebula is then determined by the age of this nebula .",
    "the proper motion of the pulsar indicates that the pulsar can cross the x - ray plateau in about 1200 yr .",
    "nonetheless , this seems unlikely the age of the pwn of psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "most of the electrons injected by the pulsar in the history are probably still confined in the bubble by the highly ordered magnetic field @xcite , as indicated by the much higher radio brightness of this region ( than the neighboring regions ) and the nice radio shells @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the pulsar dynamic age ( 64 kyr , migliazzo et al .",
    "2002 ) to represent the age of the pwn . using the formula reproduced by @xcite from pacholczyk ( 1970 )",
    ", we derived that the magnetic field strength in the nebula is @xmath41 g .",
    "this estimated magnetic field strength is comparable with the values given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but much higher than those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between our result and that ( 5.2 @xmath38 g ) of @xcite is due to that they used a much higher @xmath39 of 2.4@xmath42 hz and a much lower pwn age of 18,200 yr .",
    "we found that both the high @xmath39 and the low pwn age are problematic .",
    "their reason of choosing @xmath39 = 2.4@xmath42 hz is that @xmath39 is not much lower than the x - ray energies given the similar x - ray and radio sizes of the pwn .",
    "however , as we discussed above , the pwn has the similar x - ray and radio sizes most probably because the pulsar wind particles are well confined rather than diffuse freely .",
    "18,200 yr is the time for the pulsar to move across the @xmath1310@xmath14 radio nebula .",
    "but , again , since most of the wind particles ejected by the pulsar in the history are likely still in the bubble . to use the pulsar dynamic age as",
    "the pwn age is more reasonale .",
    "we now discuss whether the spectral break between the radio and x - ray bands is mainly due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "@xcite suggested that more than one electron populations are being injected into the pwn of psr b1757 - 24 .",
    "the injected wind particles of psr b1951 + 32 may have similar energy spectrum .",
    "however , synchrotron cooling does play an important role in the x - ray to radio spectrum in the pwn of psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "the particle energy spectrum of the bright x - ray tail ( see figures 1 and 3 ) may represent the injected particle energy spectrum well , because these particles are young .",
    "the non - detection of radio emission in this region suggests that the current overall particle energy spectrum in the pwn is significantly steeper than the injected one , due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "therefore , although not very certain , the magnetic field strength we obtained is reasonable .",
    "the pwn of psr b1951 + 32 represents the pulsar wind material confined by the ram pressure of the ambient medium , a typical example of the model suggested by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has the following regions :    * * the pulsar wind cavity and termination shock : * in the immediate region surrounding the pulsar the relativistic wind flows freely outwards with very little emission , and this region is shown as a cavity .",
    "the size of the cavity is determined by the radius of the termination shock over where the pulsar wind ram pressure ( @xmath43 ) balances the ram pressure of the ism due to the motion of the pulsar ( @xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 is the ambient medium density , @xmath46 and @xmath47 the velocity and spin - down energy of the pulsar , @xmath48 the radius of the termination shock , and @xmath49 the speed of light .",
    "for psr b1951 + 32 , @xmath50 g @xmath51 g @xmath52@xcite , @xmath53 240 km s@xmath8 , @xmath54 erg s@xmath8 , and thus @xmath55 cm , corresponding to 0.5@xmath0 at the distance ( 2.0 kpc ) to the pulsar .",
    "because psr b1951 + 32 moves supersonically in the snr , as the simulation shows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this region is more likely elongated opposite to the pulsar proper motion rather than spheric .",
    "+ in the x - ray counts profile of the nebula along the pulsar proper motion ( figure 3 ) we see strong diffuse emission in the nearby region of the pulsar .",
    "the fwhm of this emission is about 3@xmath0 , and the emission following the pulsar extends a little further out ( @xmath56 compared to @xmath57 ) than that ahead of the pulsar . we propose that this high brightness region represents most probably the emission from the termination shock , giving their roughly similar angular sizes .",
    "the bigger extension opposite to the pulsar proper motion is consistent with the distorted termination shock geometry because of the supersonic motion of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the pulsar wind cavity in this nebula is unresolved , giving the contamination from the high brightness emission from the pulsar and the termination shock . * * the particle tunnel : * the x - ray elongation ( tail ) about 4@xmath0 to 10@xmath0 northeastern from the pulsar represents most probably the particle tunnel suggested by @xcite and @xcite ( region b2 in figure 9 of gaensler et al s paper ) . reasons to identify this emission as from the particle tunnel rather than from the termination shock are the tail like morphology and its much lower brightness than that of the region neighboring the pulsar .",
    "the bright radio and x - ray features at ra ( j2000 ) = @xmath58 , dec ( j2000 ) = @xmath59 ( figure2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may represent the termination site of the particle tunnel @xcite . since this bright radio feature does not align with the pulsar s motion , it is possible that the particle tunnel has been bent due to interaction with a gradient in the ambient density and/or magnetic field , as also seen in the crab nebula and the pwn of psr b1509 - 58 @xcite . * * the interface between the pwn and snr : * in @xmath16 3.1 we have mentioned that bright x - ray plateau are well surrounded by the radio and [ o iii ] , [ s ii ] and [ n ii ] shells .",
    "this implies that the main body of the pwn is well confined by the snr ejecta .",
    "the radio map is much more shell - like than the x - ray map , suggesting that the old wind particles have accumulated at the interface between the pwn and snr , since the radio emitting particles have a much longer lifetime than the x - ray emitting particles .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , there may exist highly ordered magnetic field in the shell , which might prevent the old particles from diffusing out .",
    "+ the low surface brightness x - ray diffuse emissions in front of the bow shock and outside of the eastern edge of the pwn are positionally consistent with the bipolar h@xmath10 structure ( figure 2 of moon et al .",
    "we propose that this is the consequence of the non - uniform distribution of the snr ejecta . in the directions of the two low surface brightness x - ray protrusions ,",
    "the ejecta are of so low density that they can not effectively confine the wind particles and so the wind particles extend further out .",
    "finally the wind particles are stopped by the ism that has low metallicity , and the interaction between them ionizes the hydrogen in the ism to be h@xmath10 emitting .",
    "now we discuss the origin of the possible spectral hardening at the plateau edge .",
    "although , generally , the apparent harder spectrum can be the result of either a higher @xmath26 or an intrinsic hardening of the emitting spectrum , the first possibility can be ruled out for the hard edge of the x - ray plateau in this pwn .",
    "as shown in table 2 , with the photon index ( @xmath60 ) fixed , @xmath26 to the plateau edge needs to be @xmath61 @xmath62 higher than those to the neighboring regions . from the radio and optical observations we know that the shell has a width of @xmath130.03 pc and an inner radius of about 0.1 pc .",
    "if the higher @xmath63 to the plateau edge ( and so the radio shell ) is due to the additional absorbing material in the shell , the required number density of the shell will be @xmath64 , about 20 times higher than 50 - 100 @xmath65 , the value measured in optical observations @xcite .",
    "this implies that the apparent x - ray spectrum hardening of the edge of the plateau is not a consequence of the higher absorption but an intrinsic harder emitting spectrum .    in turn",
    ", the intrinsic harder emitting spectrum may be due to either the re - acceleration of the pulsar wind particles at the edge or the contribution from a second emission component over there .",
    "for both cases , a shock wave is needed , and a shock wave at the interface between the pwn and snr ejecta does have already been proposed by @xcite to explain the filamentary optical emission from the core of ctb 80 .",
    "this shock is in the snr ejecta rather than in the pwn because of the high sound velocity ( @xmath66 ) in the pwn , and thus the shock can not re - accelerate the pulsar wind particles .",
    "however , it is not unlikely that this shock accelerates new relativistic particles and these particles radiate synchrotron x - ray emission at the shock front , like those observed from several snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this shock generalized x - ray emission might have a flat spectrum , which makes the overall spectrum of the x - ray emission from this region harder than those from neighboring regions .",
    "the cooling of ns ( age @xmath67 yr ) is realized mainly by neutrino emission from the entire stellar body .",
    "the standard cooling model only includes neutrino emission via the modified urca process and the nonstandard models involves pion ( kaon ) condensates , strong magnetic field , or neutron superfluidity ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with",
    "the _ chandra _ observation we estimated the effective blackbody temperature of the entire surface of psr b1951 + 32 and compared it with the cooling models .",
    "the majority of equations of state yield an effective ns radius larger than 12 km for any range of masses ( haensel 2001 ) . in order to estimate the blackbody temperature of psr b1951 + 32",
    ", we fitted its x - ray spectrum with a pl+bb model by fixing the emitting radius as 12 km , and obtained a blackbody temperature of @xmath68 k with 3@xmath69 upper limit of 7.8@xmath70 k. we plot in figures 8 and 9 this temperature upper limit and the various theoretical ns surface cooling curves . in the figures the pulsar",
    "s dynamic age ( 64@xmath718 kyr ) has been used , but the characteristic age of 107 kyr is not much larger than the dynamic age @xcite and will not change the results much .",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , the effective blackbody temperature falls considerably below the predictions of the standard cooling models , suggesting the presence of some exotic cooling contribution ( such as pion , kaon condensates or strong magnetic field effects ) in the interior @xcite .",
    "the influence of the mass to the cooling of the ns has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the larger mass ns tends to cool faster because the modified or direct urca process are less suppressed by strongly proton superfluidity . as seen from figure 9",
    ", our result may also indicate that the mass of psr b1951 + 32 is higher than 1.42m@xmath71 .",
    "in @xmath16 3.2 we pointed out that there is a 0.13 kev blackbody component in the x - ray spectrum of psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "however , this component is not from the entire ns surface giving the small equivalent emitting radius . in the above paragraph",
    ", this component had not been excluded in deriving the temperature of the entire surface of psr b1951 + 32 , and thus this surface temperature upper limit is modest .",
    "if the emission from the surface of a ns is not a blackbody , then the modification by the presence of a whatever atmosphere component other than h will not make the temperature of the ns surface higher than the estimated effective temperature upper limit @xcite .",
    "in short , the above upper limit of the surface temperature of psr b1951 + 32 and its constraints on the ns cooling models are safe .",
    "we studied the morphology and spectra of psr b1951 + 32 and its pwn .",
    "the overall morphology of the pwn is consistent very well with that of a ram pressure confined pwn .",
    "the x - ray map shows a bright plateau which is within the radio and optical shells positionally , and thus represents the main body of a pwn confined in the snr .",
    "we found that the spectrum of the edge of the x - ray plateau is probably harder than those of the neighboring regions , which are possibly due to the shock between the pwn and the sn ejecta .",
    "we detected thermal x - ray emission from hot spots on the ns , and the temperature of the entire surface of psr b1951 + 32 is shown to be much lower than that predicted by the standard ns cooling model .",

    "<S> generally the spectra of these components obey the trend of steepening from the inside to the outside . </S>",
    "<S> however , the edge of the plateau probably has a harder spectrum than that of the central region of the plateau . </S>",
    "<S> the cause of the apparent hard spectrum of the plateau edge is unclear , and we speculate that it might be due to a shock between the pwn and the snr ejecta . the possible blackbody radiation component from the pulsar has a temperature of 0.13@xmath2 kev and an equivalent emitting radius of 2.2@xmath3 ( d/2 kpc ) km , and is thus probably from the hot spots on the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> we also show in this paper that the blackbody temperature of the entire surface of psr b1951 + 32 is much lower than those predicted by the standard neutron star cooling models . </S>"
