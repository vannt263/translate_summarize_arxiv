    "in 1987 , mateescu and pun @xcite studied state observability in completely specified deterministic finite automata without non - accessible states .",
    "they classified the states of finite automata into three types : observable , semi - observable , and non - observable .",
    "a state @xmath5 is said to be _",
    "observable _ if there exists a string @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is a final state ; otherwise , @xmath5 is said to be _ non - observable_. moreover , an observable state @xmath5 is said to be _ semi - observable _ if there is a state @xmath8 that is non - observable , for some input symbol @xmath9 .",
    "( in what follows , we assume that each deterministic finite automaton is completely specified without non - accessible states and , therefore , call them simply deterministic finite automata . )",
    "they proved that the family of all regular languages accepted by completely specified deterministic finite automata with all states being observable , denoted by @xmath10 , forms a proper subfamily of the family of regular languages which is not closed under union , intersection , complementation , concatenation , intersection with regular sets , @xmath11-free homomorphism , inverse homomorphism , mirror image , and right and left quotient .",
    "however , if all the regular languages are taken over a given alphabet @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is minimal for them , then the family of all such regular languages , denoted by @xmath13 , is closed under union , concatenation , and left quotient ( the other properties are the same as for @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is also not hard to see that if the automaton has a non - observable state , then there is an equivalent automaton which has only one non - observable state ( by the minimization ) .",
    "thus , we have the well - known result showing that any regular language is accepted by a deterministic finite automaton with no more than one non - observable state .    on the other hand ,",
    "considering the number of semi - observable states gives rise to an infinite hierarchy of families of subregular languages , denoted by @xmath2 , @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , it is known that for @xmath15 , all the families @xmath2 are anti - afl s , i.e. , they are not closed under union , concatenation , kleene + , @xmath11-free homomorphism , inverse homomorphism , and intersection with regular sets .",
    "however , the properties of ( some of ) the other language families were left open . note also that in comparison with @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is closed under kleene @xmath4 and , therefore , is not an anti - afl .",
    "this paper answers these questions and proves that except for @xmath3 , all the families @xmath2 , @xmath0 , are anti - afl s .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the reader is familiar with formal language theory ( see @xcite ) . for an alphabet ( finite nonempty set ) @xmath12 , @xmath17 represents the free monoid generated by @xmath12 , where the unit of @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath11 .",

    "in addition , in this paper we assume that all the states of @xmath21 are _ accessible _ , which means that for each @xmath30 , there exists @xmath31 such that @xmath32 . in",
    "what follows , the notion of a deterministic finite automaton ( dfa ) stands for an automaton which is completely specified , deterministic , and without non - accessible states .",

    "otherwise , @xmath5 is _ non - observable_. an observable state @xmath30 is said to be _ semi - observable _ if for some @xmath34 , the state @xmath8 is non - observable .",
