    "<S> = 0.2    generating and manipulating non - equilibrium spin magnetization by electric fields is one of the most desirable goals of semiconductor spintronics , because electric fields have potentialities for accessing individual spins at nanometer scale . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit ( so ) coupling is a mechanism for achieving this goal . </S>",
    "<S> it has the prominent consequence of the spin - hall effect ( she ) , where an electric - current can induce a transverse spin current and a non - equilibrium spin accumulation near sample boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of this effect are important experimental achievements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , two different mechanisms of she were proposed . </S>",

    "<S> mechanism @xcite is based on spin - dependent scattering of electrons by impurities and is mostly due to mott skew scattering @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . an _ </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic _ mechanism has also been proposed , which is related to the concept of dissipationless spin currents in a perfect crystal @xcite .    the theory of spin transport in media with so coupling is rather intricate and includes all problems inherent in the theory of anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) , which has a long history ; for reviews see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the precise definition of spin currents is still under dispute because of the problems stemming from spin nonconservation in media with so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> if spin - relaxation rates are small , a spin current with non - zero divergence can lead to spin accumulations , which are experimentally observable quantities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , because spin - currents are even with respect to time inversion , they do not necessarily vanish in thermodynamic equilibrium , hence their relation to spin transport and spin accumulation is far from obvious @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these problems inherent in the spin - transport theory make identification of physical mechanisms underlying the she observed in refs .   and rather challenging . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , wunderlich _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite observed a strong she in two - dimensional ( 2d ) layers of @xmath1-gaas and ascribed it to the _ intrinsic _ effect because of the large magnitude of the effect and large splitting of the energy spectrum typical of heavy holes . on the other hand , kato _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite attribute their measurement of she in three - dimensional @xmath0-gaas layers ( 2@xmath2 m thick ) to the _ extrinsic _ mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is indeed the case as we explain in this work . </S>",
    "<S> although an intrinsic spin hall effect , driven by the @xmath3-dresselhaus so coupling @xcite , could give rise to spin accumulation in this system , as proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , its estimated size , when impurity scattering is taken into account , is an order of magnitude smaller than the observations . </S>",
    "<S> further , because of the large sample thickness , a specifically 2d mechanism of spin accumulation proposed recently be usaj and balseiro @xcite and nikoli _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite and relying on the properties of near - edge states can not play a role in the geometry of ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> in the following , we develop a theory of extrinsic spin currents in a 3d electron system . </S>",
    "<S> it results from intrinsic so coupling in the bulk crystal that produces a so contribution to the impurity potential . </S>",
    "<S> ( this effect can occur even when the host crystal is inversion symmetric , so that spin is conserved outside the radii of the impurity potentials . ) </S>",
    "<S> we find that impurity scattering and so interaction in @xmath0-gaas are strong enough to support spin - currents that are in reasonably good agreement with findings by kato _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite without using any adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although the sign of our result is opposite to that mentioned in ref .  , there remains some uncertainty about the absolute sign in the experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since our result contains two contributions of opposite sign , and we have employed several approximations , we would believe the extrinsic mechanism to be relevant even if it turns out that the difference in the sign of the effect persists .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider an electron hamiltonian of form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an electron potential energy that varies slowly on the scale of the host lattice constant . in vacuum , the last term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : h ] ) results from relativistic corrections in the pauli equation and is known as thomas term , with @xmath6 , vacuum electron mass @xmath7 , and velocity of light @xmath8 . in direct gap cubic semiconductors like gaas , a so interaction of the same form develops in the framework of the @xmath9 model due to the coupling of a @xmath10-type conductance band to @xmath1-type valence bands . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling is well established and , for asymmetric 2d systems , it leads to the rashba term . for conduction </S>",

    "<S> all these parameters are large ( i.e. , of atomic scale ) since they result from the strong crystal potential . for example , for gaas one finds @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the so coupling in @xmath0-gaas is by _ _ six orders of magnitude stronger _ _ than in vacuum and has the _ </S>",
    "<S> opposite sign_. this enhancement of so coupling is critical for developing large extrinsic spin currents .    in the 3d problem that we consider , so coupling comes only through the potential energy @xmath5 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : h ] ) , that can be either electron energy in an impurity center or its energy @xmath19 in a driving electric field , where @xmath20 is the charge of an electron , i.e. , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore here the so @xmath3 ( dresselhaus ) correction to the electron energy in pure gaas , which is small and is absent in the @xmath11 kane model .    </S>",
    "<S> we now analyze the effect of the so coupling in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : h ] ) on the scattering at impurities , which leads to the extrinsic spin hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> this comprises two contributions , one resulting from the skew - scattering at the impurities @xcite and the other from the shift of the scattered wave packet @xcite ( known as side jump contribution ) . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions are shown schematically in fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the skew scattering contribution is calculated in the lowest order both in so interaction and in @xmath22 , with fermi momentum @xmath23 and mean free path @xmath24 . to this end , we describe the system by a spin - dependent boltzmann equation and a distribution function written as a @xmath25 spin matrix @xmath261\\!\\!1+{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{k}})\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ ] , with equilibrium distribution function @xmath27 . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we suppress the identity matrix @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the collision integral on the right hand side of the boltzmann equation has the form @xmath29,\\label{eqp : collterm}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the impurity density . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering cross section @xmath31 is spin - dependent and mixes spin components of the incoming flux . in the general case , this spin dependence is rather complex @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it simplifies essentially when we expand eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqp : collterm ] ) in so coupling and neglect the cross terms containing spin - dependent contributions of both @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for a central symmetric impurity potential , we can then write @xmath33=i(\\vartheta)\\left[\\hat{f}({\\mathbf{k}})-\\hat{f}({\\mathbf{k}}')\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   & \\qquad+i(\\vartheta)s(\\vartheta){\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\cdot{\\mathbf{n}}\\left[\\phi({\\mathbf{k}})-\\phi({\\mathbf{k}}')\\right],\\label{sigterms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the angle between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the unit vector normal to the scattering plane . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath38 is the spin - independent part of the scattering cross section , while @xmath39 is the so - called sherman function @xcite , which measures the polarization of outgoing particles scattered into direction @xmath36 from an unpolarized incoming beam of momentum @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order in the electric field , the left hand side of the boltzmann equation equals @xmath40 , where the isotropy of @xmath41 was used . </S>",
    "<S> the boltzmann equation may then be solved with the following ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> first , the usual spin - independent term is set to @xmath42 [ typically , @xmath43 with transport lifetime @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use @xmath45 for the spin polarization due to so interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is motivated by the physics of mott scattering , namely , that the spin polarization is perpendicular to the scattering plane defined by incoming electrons that drift in the direction of @xmath46 and are scattered into @xmath36 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 and @xmath48 are spherically symmetric functions of @xmath36 .    with this ansatz </S>",
    "<S> , we can evaluate the collision integrals on the right hand side of the boltzmann equation . integrating over the direction of @xmath35 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the the azimuth of @xmath35 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath36 , and suppressing an overall factor of @xmath51 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqp : collterm ] ) , we obtain ( see app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app])@xmath52\\:\\int d\\omega\\ : i\\left(\\vartheta\\right)\\,\\left(1-\\cos\\vartheta\\right),\\label{eq : icoll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral on the right is proportional to the inverse transport time @xmath53 , and @xmath54    since the left hand side of the boltzmann equation only depends on the component of @xmath36 along the electrical field , this must also be the case on the right hand side . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the second term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : icoll ] ) must cancel with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : iscoll ] ) , determining @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we defined the transport skewness@xmath56 which describes the effect of skew - scattering on the distribution function and depends on the structure of the scattering center and on the energy of the scattered particle . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our ansatz is self - consistent , and the solution of the boltzmann equation is@xmath57\\ , c_{k},\\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] i.e. , the components of @xmath58 are @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we calculate the contribution of skew - scattering to the spin current , @xmath60 , with density @xmath0 and with @xmath61 ( so contributions to the velocity are analyzed below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the charge current in the absence of so coupling , and summation over @xmath64 is implied . </S>",
    "<S> assuming low temperatures , we need to evaluate @xmath65 only near the fermi energy @xmath66 and we defined @xmath67 @xcite . if there are different species of impurity potentials , the weighted average of the corresponding transport skewnesses @xmath68 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gammaskew ] ) , should be taken . </S>",
    "<S> note that repulsive impurities generally lead to the opposite sign of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this can result in a partial suppression of spin hall currents due to impurity compensation ( where some acceptors are still present in an @xmath0-doped material and can localize electrons , leading to repulsive scatterers ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next we evaluate the contribution of the side jump @xcite to spin currents , where the wave function is laterally displaced during the scattering event . </S>",
    "<S> ( this displacement does not modify the scattering angle measured at large distances , i.e. , it does not affect the scattering cross section . ) </S>",
    "<S> side - jump currents were analyzed in detail for the anomalous hall effect @xcite and we now relate the ahe to the she . in the ahe , </S>",
    "<S> a net polarization in combination with so interaction at impurities , leads to electrical hall currents , even in the absence of an external magnetic field . for the she </S>",
    "<S> , electrons are unpolarized in equilibrium and we consider induced spin currents @xmath69 . because @xmath70 is small and spin relaxation is of order @xmath71 @xcite , one can understand the @xmath72-component of spin current as difference in particle currents of two spin species with polarizations @xmath73 . for non - interacting electrons , </S>",
    "<S> each of these species carries the anomalous hall current @xmath74 of a system with density @xmath75 and with spins fully aligned along the @xmath73 direction , and we can express the spin hall current as@xmath76    for the ahe , the side - jump contribution was found to be @xmath77 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it results from so corrections @xmath78 to the velocity operator during impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> nozires and lewiner @xcite clarified that this anomalous velocity @xmath79 comprises two equal so contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the first is @xmath80-{\\mathbf{v}}_{0}=(\\lambda/\\hbar)(\\nabla v\\times{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}})$ ] and becomes @xmath81 after the equation of motion , @xmath82 , is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the second originates from the correction to the coordinate operator , the yafet term @xmath83 @xcite , and contributes as @xmath84 . note that @xmath85 leads to a factor of 2 which is often ignored </S>",
    "<S> heuristically , we can now understand the current @xmath86 as follows . for scattering at an impurity with momentum transfer @xmath87 , the lateral displacement it @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous hall current is recovered from @xmath89 , by using that the momentum dissipated per scattering event is @xmath90 . using @xmath86 @xcite and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : shah ] ) , we readily obtain the side jump contribution to the she , @xmath91 the sum @xmath92 provides the total spin - hall current .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , one could consider a model where the electron charge is cancelled by a uniform positive background , with only small fluctuations in the potential @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , we could let @xmath94 become arbitrarily large . </S>",
    "<S> although the side - jump contribution to the spin hall conductance is independent of @xmath95 the skew - scattering contribution , given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ss ] ) , would grow with @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this growth would be cut off , however , when @xmath94 becomes comparable to the inverse of the so splitting @xmath96 due to the @xmath3 dresselhaus term . if @xmath97 is small compared to @xmath98 , as would be the case </S>",
    "<S> if the potential fluctuations are sufficiently small , then the skew - scattering contribution will be smaller than the intrinsic contribution by a factor of order @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now evaluate the skewness @xmath68 [ eq .  ( [ eq : gammaskew ] ) ] for a screened attractive coulomb potential . for this , we make use of the long - established theory of single electron scattering by an atom @xcite . we rescale the parameters to make a connection between the atomic hamiltonian and the effective hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : h ] ) ] with @xmath100 , effective mass @xmath101 , permittivity @xmath102 , and screening length @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> we match @xmath93 be setting the atomic number to @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> further , to match the so interaction , we define an `` effective '' speed - of - light @xmath105 such that @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , when the sign of @xmath70 differs from its vacuum value , we replace @xmath39 by @xmath107 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gammaskew ] ) @xcite . for gaas , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , thus @xmath110 and @xmath111 , with fine structure constant @xmath112 . when evaluating @xmath38 , screening of the long - range coulomb interaction is required , otherwise the integrals in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gammaskew ] ) diverge , e.g. , @xmath113 . for exponential screening and in second order born approximation , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is given by the dalitz formula @xcite ( with the parameters used below and at large @xmath114 , it agrees well with the exact solution for the unscreened potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume thomas - fermi screening with inverse screening length @xmath115 the numerical evaluation below shows that the transport skewness @xmath68 depends only weakly on the screening , implying that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ss ] ) is well - suited for evaluating the skew - scattering contribution . [ because of low sensitivity of @xmath97 to screening , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ss ] ) is also in agreement with the common belief that the skew - scattering contribution is proportional to @xmath94 . ] when evaluating @xmath39 , we note that the main contribution comes from large angles @xmath114 where the effects of screening are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we thus use for @xmath39 the exact expression for an unscreened potential @xcite . note that when evaluating @xmath39 , the small parameter is @xmath116 , with effective bohr radius @xmath117 , </S>",
    "<S> so we expect @xmath118 for the order of magnitude of @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now estimate @xmath68 for gaas and for the electron density @xmath119 reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , i.e. , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . as a test </S>",
    "<S> , we first evaluate the longitudinal conductivity using an impurity density @xmath122 and the drude formula , @xmath123 with @xmath124 and arrive at @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> this is within 10% of the experimentally observed conductivity at low voltages ; a surprisingly good agreement , given that the rather small value @xmath126 restricts the accuracy of the boltzmann approach . </S>",
    "<S> next we evaluate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gammaskew ] ) and find @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is rather stable and changes by less than 30% when @xmath128 or @xmath66 increase or decrease by a factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we estimate the spin hall currents . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were performed at electrical fields @xmath129 where the conductivity increased to @xmath130 due to electron heating . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath68 is not very sensitive to these heating effects and we still use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ss ] ) but with the increased conductivity . for an electrical field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath131 , we find both contributions to the spin hall conductivity @xmath132 , namely @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in total , we arrive at the extrinsic spin hall conductivity @xmath135 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude is within the error bars of the experimental value of @xmath136 found from spin accumulation near the free edges of the specimen  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> bernevig and zhang calculated intrinsic spin currents due to @xmath3-dresselhaus interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of spin - orbit interactions linear in @xmath36 , where vertex corrections lead to a cancellation of the spin current @xcite , for the @xmath3 interaction this is not true ; e.g. , for @xmath10-wave scatterers the vertex corrections vanish identically @xcite . however , in the dirty limit @xmath137 , where @xmath96 is the so splitting @xmath96 at the fermi level and for experimental parameters of ref .  </S>",
