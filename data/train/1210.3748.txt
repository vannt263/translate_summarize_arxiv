    "<S> double chooz is unique among modern reactor - based neutrino experiments studying @xmath0 disappearance in that data can be collected with all reactors off . in this paper , we present data from 7.53 days of reactor - off running . applying the same selection criteria as used in the double chooz reactor - on oscillation analysis , </S>",
    "<S> a measured background rate of 1.0@xmath10.4 events / day is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the background model for accidentals , cosmogenic @xmath2-@xmath3-emitting isotopes , fast neutrons from cosmic muons , and stopped-@xmath4 decays used in the oscillation analysis is demonstrated to be correct within the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> kinematic distributions of the events , which are dominantly cosmic - ray - produced correlated - background events , are provided . </S>",
    "<S> the background rates are scaled to the shielding depths of two other reactor - based oscillation experiments , daya bay and reno .    with the discovery of the last mixing angle of the three - neutrino mixing matrix @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , neutrino oscillation experiments entered the precision era . </S>",
    "<S> the next goal is precision studies of the three - active - neutrino model , including searches for @xmath5-violation or non - unitarity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from searches to precision measurements necessitates a higher standard for understanding backgrounds to oscillation analyses .    among ongoing reactor - based oscillation experiments , </S>",
    "<S> double chooz ( dc ) is unique in obtaining a `` reactor - off '' data set when the two cores of the chooz site are both brought down for maintenance . </S>",
    "<S> the daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite experiments are each located at complexes with six cores . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , they are unlikely to obtain data with all cores off . the chooz experiment reported reactor - off running @xcite , but with varying scintillator stability and higher accidentals rate and threshold than in dc . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the results of 7.53 days of dc reactor - off running , collected in 2011 and 2012 . this data set demonstrates the validity of the background predictions for present and future @xmath6 experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the primary goal of dc is measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameter @xmath6 through @xmath0 disappearance . </S>",
    "<S> the design of the daya bay and reno detectors is similar to that of dc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all three experiments use the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) interaction ( @xmath7 ) in liquid scintillator . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is identified by a correlated pair of signals , the first consistent with a positron and the second consistent with a @xmath3-capture .    </S>",
    "<S> the dc far detector is positioned 1050 m from the two 4.25 gw@xmath8 ( thermal power ) cores of the chooz nuclear power plant . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of four concentric cylindrical regions , with centered chimneys for filling and insertion of calibration sources . </S>",
    "<S> the innermost cylinder is the `` neutrino target '' ( nt ) , a 10 m@xmath9 volume of gadolinium - doped liquid scintillator . </S>",
    "<S> the acrylic nt cylinder is surrounded by a 55 cm thick `` @xmath10 catcher '' ( gc ) consisting of gd - free scintillator . </S>",
    "<S> the acrylic cylinder of the gc is immersed in a 105 cm thick nonscintillating oil `` buffer region '' containing 390 10-inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) . </S>",
    "<S> these three cylinders , collectively called the `` inner detector '' ( i d ) , are contained in a stainless steel vessel which is encompassed by a 50 cm thick liquid scintillator region forming the `` inner veto '' ( iv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the iv is surrounded by 15 cm of demagnetized steel , followed by rock . above this system </S>",
    "<S> is the `` outer veto '' ( ov ) , consisting of segmented scintillator modules for muon tracking .    </S>",
    "<S> the detector is shielded from cosmic rays by a 300 meters water equivalent ( m.w.e . )  </S>",
    "<S> rock overburden , in a hill topology . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant backgrounds in the reactor neutrino experiments are : spallation products , particularly @xmath11li and @xmath12he , produced by cosmic muons interacting in oil , which emit a @xmath3 immediately following the @xmath2-decay process ; stopping muons ; and fast neutrons produced by muons in the surrounding rock . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to the first as `` @xmath2-@xmath3 backgrounds , '' while the latter two are collectively called `` @xmath4/fast-@xmath3 '' backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> these are directly measured by reactor - off running . </S>",
    "<S> the dc overburden being similar to those of daya bay and reno , these results can be applied to those experiments with modest scaling for depth variations .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct measurement of the backgrounds in the dc oscillation analyses is performed by applying the same @xmath13 selection criteria as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite to the reactor - off data sample . </S>",
    "<S> a minimal set of selection cuts was applied in @xcite ( `` dci selection '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> two extra cuts were added in @xcite ( `` dcii selection '' ) to reduce background contamination in the @xmath13 candidate sample . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here apply to both the dci and dcii selections , comparing the reactor - off data with expectations from the published reactor - on oscillation analyses  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> candidates are extracted from a sample of triggers ( `` singles '' ) above 0.5 mev that are neither tagged as a background known as `` light noise , '' nor vetoed by the 1 ms muon veto ( @xmath4 veto ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dci selection then applies four cuts to the prompt ( @xmath14 ) and delayed ( @xmath3 ) ibd signals : 1 ) time difference : @xmath15s @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath18s ; 2 ) prompt trigger : @xmath19@xmath20mev ; 3 ) delayed trigger : @xmath21@xmath22mev ; 4 ) multiplicity : no additional valid triggers from @xmath18s preceding the prompt signal to @xmath23s after it . </S>",
    "<S> the dcii selection further rejects candidates according to two more conditions : 5 ) cosmogenic @xmath2-@xmath3 background reduction : candidates within a 0.5 s window after a muon depositing high energy ( @xmath24600 mev ) crosses the i d ( `` showering-@xmath4 veto '' ) ; 6 ) @xmath4/fast-@xmath3 background reduction : candidates whose prompt signal is coincident with an ov signal ( ov veto ) .    during the reactor - off period , </S>",
    "<S> the total and showering muon rates ( i d only ) were 46 and 0.10 s@xmath25 , respectively , consistent with those during the reactor - on period to 4% @xcite . by applying the @xmath4 veto without and with the additional dcii showering-@xmath4 veto , 7.19 and 6.84 live days , respectively , </S>",
    "<S> are obtained . within these times , a singles rate of 11.01 s@xmath25 is measured , again consistent , within 4% , with that during the reactor - on period . hence , the same accidental background level is expected for dci and dcii .    </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab : expbkg ] shows the estimated background and observed reactor - off event rates for both the dci and dcii selections . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the background rate estimation relies on data published in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the accidental rate uncertainties quoted include an additional effect of day - to - day variations , negligible in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the dcii selection , the @xmath11li rate corresponds to the value used as an input for the oscillation fit , which is consistent with the fit output , and the @xmath4/fast-@xmath3 rate is smaller than that reported in  @xcite since ov duty - cycle was 100% during the reactor - off period .    . </S>",
    "<S> background rate estimates  @xcite , in events / day , for the reactor - off data sample , compared to observation , for the two selections described in the text . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : expbkg ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -@xmath3 decay rates and comparison with quoted values </S>",
    "<S> . results were scaled by number of carbon atoms and normalized to muon flux at dc far site . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines and shaded regions correspond to rate and scaling uncertainties in reactor - off analysis : dci ( red solid line ) and open data points compare the total @xmath2-@xmath3 rate , while dcii ( blue solid line ) and filled data points correspond to analyses with an extended veto following showering muons . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaleli ] ]    in conclusion , we have reported a direct measurement of the cosmic - ray - induced background in the dc oscillation analysis using 7.53 days of data with both reactors off . </S>",
    "<S> the identified candidates are well understood as due to accidentals , @xmath2-@xmath3-emitting isotopes , cosmic muons producing fast neutrons , and stopped muons that decay . with the same cuts applied as in the double chooz reactor - on oscillation analysis @xcite , the total background including accidentals , cosmogenic @xmath2-@xmath3-emitting isotopes , fast neutrons from cosmic muons and stopped-@xmath4 decays </S>",
    "<S> is 1.0@xmath10.4 events / day . </S>",
    "<S> the result is consistent with estimations in the dc oscillation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been scaled to depths of interest to the daya bay and reno reactor - based neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>"
