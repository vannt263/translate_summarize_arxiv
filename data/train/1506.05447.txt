    "population studies of x - ray binaries in nearby galaxies have been made possible thanks to the superb spatial resolution and excellent sensitivity of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) of point sources have been obtained for many galaxies , and they are found to be environment dependent ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in young normal galaxies , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs )",
    "dominate , and the xlfs follow a simple power law ( pl ) @xmath10 with @xmath11 over a large range of luminosity : @xmath12 erg  s@xmath2 @xmath13 erg  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in old normal galaxies or in the bulge of young normal galaxies , low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) dominate , and the xlfs seem relatively complicated , showing both a high - luminosity break at @xmath14 erg s@xmath2 @xcite and a low - luminosity break at @xmath15 erg s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the slope between these two breaks is @xmath161.82.2 . above the high - luminosity break ,",
    "the xlfs decrease sharply . below the low - luminosity break",
    ", the xlfs might flatten to @xmath17 .",
    "the high - luminosity break may be due to the eddington limit of neutron star ( ns ) lmxbs .",
    "the low - luminosity break has been attributed to either the transition from mass transfer driven by magnetized stellar wind at high luminosities to mass transfer driven by gravitational wave emission at low luminosities @xcite , or different types of donor stars with the high - luminosity ones being giants and the low - luminosity ones being main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the former predicts the slope below the break to be about 1.0 and the slope above the break to be about 2.0 .",
    "for the latter explanation , the steepening of the xlf at high luminosity is due to the short life time of binary systems with giants .",
    "the xlfs of lmxbs have often been obtained by combining multiple galaxies in order to improve the statistics . however , this method is subject to the limitation that the normalizations of the xlfs in different galaxies show a scatter of more than a factor of two @xcite .",
    "the xlfs of lmxbs well below @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 are still only obtained for very few old galaxies , most notably centaurus a and ngc 3379 @xcite , and the bulge of m31 @xcite .",
    "a low detection limit is critical for constraining the low - luminosity break , which has been shown mostly for the old populations in young galaxies @xcite .",
    "deep observations of old galaxies are also needed for the investigation of the differences between the xlfs of lmxbs in globular clusters ( gcs ) and in the stellar field , which can be used to check whether they have the same origin .",
    "for instance , there is a relative underabundance of faint lmxbs in gcs when compared with field lmxbs @xcite .",

    "our xlf of field lmxbs can be fitted with parameters typically seen in the literature for other old normal galaxies or the bulge of spiral galaxies , with a possible break around @xmath167 erg s@xmath2 .",

    "* ) in the high and low luminosities .    however , the interpretation of our xlf of field lmxbs is complicated by the presence of a degenerate solution with a high break at about @xmath168 erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this degeneracy appears to be associated with a spatial variation of the xlf , with the xlf in the inner region ( ( 0.0460.2)@xmath28 ) being flatter and having a lower break ( @xmath169 erg s@xmath2 ) than that in the outer region ( ( 0.21.0)@xmath28 ) , which has a break around @xmath8 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the xlf of field lmxbs in the inner region is closer to the xlf of gc lmxbs .",
    "one possible cause for this is that our field lmxb sample in the inner region could include some gc lmxbs that we can not identify due to significant incompleteness effects near the galaxy center that limit our ability to detect gcs in the optical . in the outer region we found 25 lmxbs from 219 gcs and 44.5 in the field ( after excluding the cxb contribution ) above @xmath127 , but",
    "only 2 gc lmxbs from 7 gcs and 43.0 field ones in the inner region . to have the same ratio of gc lmxbs to field lmxbs",
    ", we would have missed 22 gc lmxbs in the inner region . however , it is well known that the spatial distribution of gcs is more extended than the stellar light , as can also be seen in figure  [ fig : spatialdist ] for the outer region .",
    "the distribution of gcs within ( 0.31.3)@xmath28 , if fitted with a pl , is found to follow @xmath170 , which would indicate that in the inner region there should be 93 gcs .",
    "assuming the same detection rate of lmxbs ( @xmath171 ) as in the outer region , we would have missed 6.6 gc lmxbs , given that we have detected 2 gc lmxbs and 2 candidates .",
    "thus , the number of gc lmxbs that we missed in the inner region is probably small , compared with the total number of sources observed ( 43.0 after subtracting the cxb contribution ) , and their effect on the xlf of field lmxbs in the inner region should be insignificant .",
    "alternatively , the spatial variation of the xlf of field lmxbs might be real and can be explained if the field lmxbs in the inner region have a dynamical origin similar to gc lmxbs .",
    "there are two scenarios : one is the dynamical formation of lmxbs in the dense stellar environment near galaxy nuclei , and the other is the destruction of gcs that drift toward the galaxy center due to mass segregation , leaving behind the remnant lmxbs .",
    "the former was argued to be the dominant mechanism to account for the high specific frequency of x - ray sources , per unit stellar mass ( following the @xmath172 dependence on the stellar density ) , near the center ( @xmath173@xmath174 ) of m31 by @xcite .",
    "however , we do not see increasing high specific frequency of ( non - gc ) x - ray sources at the very center , compared with the outer region ( figure  [ fig : spatialdist ] ) .",
    "the stellar density of m31 is around 30  pc@xmath175 at @xmath174 from the center @xcite .",
    "based on the stellar density model by @xcite , we expect that ngc 3115 reaches a similar stellar density at @xmath74@xmath08@xmath56 in the major - axis direction .",
    "therefore the former mechanism is probably still not significant in our inner region , which excludes the central @xmath32 elliptical region .",
    "there is large uncertainty in estimating the level of the second mechanism .",
    "the specific frequency of ( non - gc ) x - ray sources seems to peak around @xmath176 0.10.2 .",
    "if some part of it is due to the second mechanism , the remnant lmxbs should gain some momentum to reach this region during the destruction of gcs , or the destruction should be able to occur there .",
    "considering the possible contamination of the lmxbs from undetected or disrupted gcs in the inner region , the xlf in the outer region is probably a better representation of the characteristics of primordial field lmxbs .",
    "its break at about @xmath8 erg s@xmath2 ( table  [ tbl : xlffit ] ) seems somewhat higher ( at the 90% confidence level ) than typical values of around @xmath128 erg s@xmath2 reported in other studies that normally used most of the field ( that is , no differentiation between the inner and outer regions ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained xlfs combining 20 early - type galaxies for the inner and outer regions separately .",
    "their inner and outer regions were defined as ( 0.23)@xmath177 and ( 410)@xmath177 , respectively , where @xmath177 is the @xmath51-band half - light radius .",
    "our inner and outer regions for ngc 3115 are approximately ( 0.31.3)@xmath177 and ( 1.36.5)@xmath177 , respectively .",
    "visually it appears that the break of the xlf in their outer region is higher than the xlf in their inner region ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "however , they did not carry out the fit , and the significance of this variation is not clear .",
    "moreover , they did not exclude gc lmxbs , making it difficult to compare directly . in the future",
    ", more galaxies should be used to investigate the xlf of field lmxbs from the outer region to check whether the high break that we observed in the xlf of field lmxbs in the outer region of ngc 3115 is universal or due to statistical fluctuation .",
    "if it is real , the best explanation is probably the eddington limit of ns lmxbs . in paper",
    "i , we have shown that most of our bright lmxbs ( above several 10@xmath178 erg  s@xmath2 ) are ns lmxbs in the soft state .    in summary ,",
    "the flatter xlf of field lmxbs in the inner region compared to that in the outer region is unlikely due to dynamically formed lmxbs in the dense stellar environment near the galaxy nucleus , but could be due to contamination of lmxbs from undetected and/or ( more likely ) disrupted gcs in the inner region .",
    "the field lmxbs in the outer region are more likely to be primordial .",
    "the break of their xlf could be due to the eddington limit of ns lmxbs , agreeing with our finding in paper i that most of our bright sources are ns lmxbs in the soft state .",
    "considering the large detection rate of lmxbs ( @xmath0@xmath179 , section  [ sec : gclmxbs ] ) in the most metal - rich and the most massive gcs , some of these gcs probably in fact host multiple lmxbs which can not be resolved by _",

    "thus we can not confirm any effect of blending on the variability .    to investigate the source blending effects on the xlf",
    ", we carried out monte carlo simulations using equation  [ eq : gcprob ] with @xmath201 if @xmath187 and @xmath188 and @xmath196 elsewhere , as obtained above .",

    "the results from 1000 simulations are shown in figure  [ fig : gc_sim ] , where we plot the xlf using the mean ( open circles ; the standard deviation is shown as the error bar ) of lmxbs in each luminosity bin from these simulations .",
    "the simulated xlfs seem steeper than the observed one overall , as expected . however , the difference is small , which is mainly due to two reasons .",
    "one is that about one third of gc lmxbs are observed to cluster within a very narrow luminosity range ( 0.81.4)@xmath69 erg s@xmath2 , but these gcs are widely spread around in the color - magnitude diagram , thus producing no significant source blending effects .",
    "the second reason is that in the area of parameter space where gcs preferentially host lmxbs , both faint and luminous lmxbs were observed .",
    "that is , the source blending effects are seen at different luminosity levels .",
    "therefore we conclude that the source blending effects on the xlf are negligible , within the uncertainties of our data .    instead of assuming equal weights to construct the xlf ( section  [ sec : gcxlf ] )",
    ", we explored the option of weighting the incompleteness function to reflect the tendency of lmxbs to be detected in metal - rich and massive gcs .",
    "we recalculated the xlf of gc lmxbs with the incompleteness function weighted by the probability of hosting one or more lmxbs , based on equation  [ eq : gcprob ] again with @xmath201 if @xmath187 and @xmath188 and @xmath196 elsewhere ( the source blending effects can not be taken into account simultaneously though ) .",
    "we find that the xlf obtained in this way shows no significant difference from that shown in section  [ sec : gcxlf ] .",
    "therefore the observed paucity of faint gc lmxbs below the xlf break @xmath0@xmath18 erg  s@xmath2 in ngc 3115 should be real .",
    "it could be explained if there is a transition from persistent sources to transients around this break @xcite .",
    "one main class of gc lmxbs could be ultracompact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) .",

    "used the limiting significance level of @xmath215 for _ wavdetect _ and kept sources with false binomial probability less than 0.004 ( see their equation 1 ) , while we adopted the limiting significance level of @xmath216 for _ wavdetect _ ( paper i ) and used sources above @xmath127 , which results in using only sources with the signal to noise ratio @xmath2172.9 .",
    "moreover , lehmer et al .",
    "used sources detected from the merged and individual observations ( though the false binomial probability was calculated exclusively from the merged photometry ) , while we used sources detected from the merged observation only .",
    "therefore we expect that lehmer et al",
    ". could detect more real faint sources but also more spurious faint sources than we did .",
    "the region studied is also different .",
    "lehmer et al .",
    "used an elliptical region of a semi - major axis of 2.7@xmath24 , a semi - minor axis of 1.1@xmath24 and a position angle of @xmath218 ( based on the @xmath140-band galaxy emission ) , excluding a central circular region of radius @xmath219 , but we use the slightly larger @xmath28 ellipse , excluding the central @xmath32 elliptical region .",
    "we excluded a smaller central region because of our use of subpixel binning images for source detection in the central region . within their study region",
    ", we have 90 sources above @xmath127 , among which 17.4 are expected to be cxb sources , while in our study region , we have 145 sources above @xmath127 , 26.5 of which are expected to be cxb sources . the handling of the cxb contribution in the fits to the xlfs is also different .",
    "lehmer et al .",
    "excluded all agns that they could identify from the _ hst_/acs imaging ( they found 9 such sources , which is about 50% of the expected number ) , while we estimated the cxb contribution following @xcite .",
    "we tried to check whether we can reproduce their xlf fitting results ( they also fitted the xlfs with a broken pl ) based on the sources that we detected but using their study region .",
    "we followed their technique to exclude all agns that we could identify ( 10 from paper i ) from the _",
    "hst_/acs imaging instead of estimating the cxb contribution following @xcite .",
    "we found that we generally obtained slightly lower values of the initial slope @xmath148 by ( 12)@xmath57 , most probably due to their inclusion of more very faint sources than were in our sample .",
    "specifically , in the fit to the total xlf , they obtained @xmath220 , and we obtained @xmath221 if we chose a high - break solution with @xmath222 erg s@xmath2 similar to their @xmath223 erg s@xmath2 . we still see the degenerate low - break ( @xmath224 erg s@xmath2 ) fit , which has a c statistic larger than that of the high - break fit by only 0.4 ( or by only 0.1 if the cxb contribution was subtracted from modeling instead ) . for the field lmxb xlf , we preferred a high - break fit , which was also adopted by lehmer et al . and is similar to our xlf of field lmxbs in the outer part of the @xmath28 region ( section  [ sec : fieldxlf ] ) . for the gc lmxb xlf , they also obtained a high break luminosity @xmath225 erg s@xmath2 , but we can not constrain it well ( @xmath226 erg s@xmath2 ; we have 22 gc lmxbs ( including three candidates ) above @xmath127 in their region , while they have 25 gc lmxbs detected ) .",
    "overall , we see no large discrepancy between our results and theirs for lmxbs in their study region .",

    "<S> we have studied the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 3115 , using the megasecond _ chandra _ x - ray visionary project observation . with a total exposure time of @xmath01.1 ms </S>",
    "<S> , we constructed the xlf down to a limiting luminosity of @xmath0@xmath1 erg  s@xmath2 , much deeper than typically reached for other early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we found significant flattening of the overall lmxb xlf from @xmath3 above @xmath4 erg  s@xmath2 to @xmath5 below it , though we could not rule out a fit with a higher break at @xmath0@xmath6 erg  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found evidence that the xlf of lmxbs in globular clusters ( gcs ) is overall flatter than that of field lmxbs . </S>",
    "<S> thus our results for this galaxy do not support the idea that all lmxbs are formed in gcs . </S>",
    "<S> the xlf of field lmxbs seems to show spatial variation , with the xlf in the inner region of the galaxy being flatter than that in the outer region , probably due to contamination of lmxbs from undetected and/or disrupted gcs in the inner region . </S>",
    "<S> the xlf in the outer region is probably the xlf of primordial field lmxbs , exhibiting @xmath7 up to a break close to the eddington limit of neutron star lmxbs ( @xmath0@xmath8 erg  s@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the break of the gc lmxb xlf is lower , at @xmath0@xmath9 erg  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm previous findings that the metal - rich / red gcs are more likely to host lmxbs than the metal - poor / blue gcs , which is more significant for more luminous lmxbs , and that more massive gcs are more likely to host lmxbs . </S>"
