    "parity violation has played an important role in the understanding of the nature of the weak interaction .",
    "today the weak interaction is well understood in the leptonic , semileptonic , and strange nonleptonic sectors . however , our picture of the nonstrange nonleptonic weak interaction , which appears in nuclear processes , e.g. in @xmath7 scattering , is far from being complete @xcite .",
    "the presence of the strong part of the nucleon - nucleon force makes the effect of the weak nucleon - nucleon interaction hardly observable .",
    "the size of the parity violating effect is , for example , typically in the order of @xmath8 relative to the effect of the strong @xmath9-@xmath9 force .    despite the smallness of its effect , parity violation in a nuclear process",
    "was experimentally observed in 1967 by lobashov _",
    "since then , nuclear parity violation has been studied in @xmath10 scattering and @xmath11 capture , in few - nucleon systems ( e.g.@xmath12 and @xmath13 scattering ) , in parity - mixed doublets of light nuclei , and in polarized neutron scattering on heavy nuclei . for two excellent review articles on the nuclear parity violation experiments ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "complex nuclear structure and dynamics often leads to ambiguities in the theoretical description of nuclear parity violation involving light nuclei .",
    "however , impressive theoretical progress has been achieved recently in the description of the six - nucleon systems @xcite . while realistic gfmc results for light nuclei , including for @xmath2li , are very encouraging @xcite , these studies are basically restricted to bound states .",
    "however , effective many - body theories like the microscopic multicluster model yield a good and consistent description of the nuclear structure and dynamics ( bound and scattering states ) in the six - nucleon systems simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this method appears thus to be well suited for the study of the parity - violating @xmath0 decay of the @xmath14 state of @xmath2li at 3.56 mev excitation energy .",
    "as the spin - parity of the deuteron is @xmath15 , the decay of the @xmath1 @xmath2li state into the @xmath0 channel is only possible if the continuum final state is @xmath16 ; thus this process violates parity .",
    "as the final state is @xmath17 , this process is sensitive to the isovector part of the parity - violating @xmath9-@xmath9 potential .",
    "the best experimental upper limit for the parity - violating @xmath0 partial decay width is @xmath18 ev @xcite .",
    "the two most comprehensive theoretical descriptions of this process are based on the shell model @xcite and the harmonic oscillator cluster model @xcite , respectively . if one assumes the same parameters for the parity - violating @xmath9-@xmath9 potential , these two studies find parity - violating decay widths which differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "both of these models contain questionable approximations . in @xcite",
    "the initial @xmath1 wave function is rather schematically described by one @xmath19 configuration with total spin and angular momentum zero .",
    "note that the initial state has a spatially extended halo - like neutron - proton tail @xcite .",
    "the ability of the shell model @xcite to reproduce such a loosely bound state with genuine three - body ( @xmath3 ) nature is questionable . a model which can not reproduce this tail tends to compress the wave function inside , thus supposedly increasing the decay width .",
    "moreover , both studies @xcite use a potential model for the @xmath0 scattering , which is inconsistent with the description of the bound state .    in the present paper",
    "we study the problem in a six - body three - cluster model , which is practically complete in the @xmath20 space .",
    "we also investigate the effects of @xmath4 distortion and t+@xmath5he rearrangement on the decay width .",
    "our model correctly describes the spatially extended nature of the @xmath1 bound state , and uses an @xmath0 scattering state which is consistent with the bound state .",
    "we try to use a model which is as parameter - free as possible by requiring the good reproduction of the properties of the subsystems ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 scattering states , channel thresholds , binding energies , etc . ) .",

    "we use the minnesota effective interaction @xcite as the parity - conserving strong nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that this interaction provides excellent @xmath21 and @xmath22 phase shifts in the @xmath82 and @xmath83 models by using @xmath84 and @xmath85 exchange mixture parameters of the central interaction and slightly different spin - orbit forces , respectively . here",
    "we refit the @xmath86 parameter in order to reproduce the experimental binding energy of the @xmath1 state ( 0.137 mev relative to the @xmath3 threshold ) in all four models .",
    "these adjustments are rather small .",
    "for example , in our full model we have to change @xmath86 by only 0.7% .",
    "the weights of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 components of the wave functions are between 86.589.5% and 13.510.5% , respectively in the four different models in accordance with the results of several different model calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the @xmath89 phase shifts of our four models , together with the experimental data @xcite and the phase shift generated by the mcintyre - haeberli optical potential @xcite .",
    "note that the two lowest - energy experimental data points are not tabulated in @xcite , we read them off the figure of ref .  @xcite .",
    "all our theoretical models slightly underestimate the absolute value of the phase shift at the @xmath90 mev , which is the final energy of the decay process .",
    "the full model ( iv ) is closest to experiment .",
    "below we investigate the sensitivity of the decay width on the phase shift at 2.09 mev .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0 spectrum of @xmath2li is reproduced well by all four models .",
    "for example , in the @xmath91 model , the @xmath92=@xmath93 ( ground state ) , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 @xmath2li states are at 1.421 mev , 0.637 mev ( @xmath96 mev ) , and 4.254 mev ( @xmath97 mev ) , respectively , while the experimental values are 1.475 mev , 0.71 mev ( @xmath98 mev ) , and 2.83 mev ( @xmath99 mev ) .",
    "all energies are relative to the @xmath0 threshold . as in all models",
    "the deuteron has the correct binding energy , the position of the @xmath0 threshold relative to the @xmath20 is always reproduced . moreover , the @xmath100he+@xmath43 and @xmath100li+@xmath44 thresholds are at the correct position , while our @xmath49 threshold is 4 - 5 mev higher than experimentally .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we show the parity - violating @xmath101 partial decay widths given by our four different model spaces , taking into account only the pion term of ( [ pnc ] ) and using the ddh best value for @xmath102 .",
    "the spread among the results is almost an order of magnitude .",
    "to understand the origin of these big differences we performed some test calculations .",
    "we found that the width depends moderately on the @xmath0 phase shift at 2.09 mev .",
    "if we used a scattering wave function which reproduced the phase shift of the mcintyre - haeberli potential at 2.09 mev , then @xmath103 was increased by roughly 50% .",
    "we checked the sensitivity of @xmath104 on the binding energy of the @xmath1 state by using the original @xmath85 exchange mixture parameter in our simplest model .",
    "the binding energy decreases by 350 kev ( resulting in a positive energy pseudo - bound state ) which leads to a 15% decrease in @xmath104 . obviously , a larger probability of finding nucleons farther from each other decreases somewhat the magnitude of the internal wave function and reduces @xmath104 .",
    "we checked the role of the orthogonal @xmath87 and ( 1,1 ) components in the bound state wave function of our four models by performing calculations for the two components separately . in each case",
    "the exchange mixture parameter @xmath86 has been refitted to reproduce the correct @xmath1 binding energy . for the @xmath105 model space ,",
    "the individual @xmath106 and @xmath88 components yield widths of @xmath107 ev and @xmath108 ev , respectively .",
    "this is to be compared with the result @xmath109 ev , obtained if both components are considered .",
    "although we observe a strong sensitivity of @xmath104 on the weight of the @xmath110 component , this can not explain the big differences in table [ tab1 ] alone , as the weight of this component is roughly the same in all model spaces .    in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we list the partial contributions of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 components of the bound state to the parity - violating matrix element for our four model spaces .",
    "one can see that the contribution of the @xmath106 component changes its sign when going from the model with only one @xmath4-particle basis state to the one which contains @xmath4 breathing modes .",
    "this is obviously the consequence of some kind of cancellations taking place in the matrix element .",
    "these strong cancellations appear to be a warning that it is dangerous to generate bound and scattering states inconsistently from different models , as has been done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a similar sensitivity is found in the modelling of the beta - delayed deuteron emission process in @xmath2he @xcite .",
    "as @xmath104 only moderately depends on the scattering state , the main origin of these cancellations must be in the bound state wave function .",
    "as the matrix element of the parity - violating interaction can not be rewritten in a form which contains only relative motions , we can not directly determine which property of the bound state wave function causes the sign change in the @xmath106 component . by investigating the contribution of the individual @xmath4-particle basis states , we find that the contributions of the excited @xmath4 pseudo - states are substantial , but they do not cause the sign change . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , their effect might be to shift the nodal positions in the bound state wave function .    from table",
    "ii we observe that our model has a non - anticipated sensitivity to the model space , showing that the parity - violating decay is determined by components in the model space which are not well constrained by the other low - energy properties of the 6-nucleon systems which our models describe quite well .",
    "nevertheless we will complete our study by calculating the decay width @xmath104 within our most elaborate model space ( iv ) and using the full parity - violating interaction as defined in eqs.(1)-(2 ) .",
    "then @xmath111 in table [ tab3 ] we give @xmath104 for the coupling constants of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "one observes about an order of magnitude spread among the decay widths calculated for these different sets of coupling constants . for comparison , table [ tab3 ]",
    "also gives @xmath104 using only the pion contribution in the parity - violating potential .",
    "as the @xmath28 and @xmath29 contributions are small , the decay width shows about an order of magnitude variation among the various model spaces .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the predictions of @xcite and @xcite . in these models",
    "the pionic term alone gives @xmath112 ev and @xmath113 ev , respectively , using the ddh best value for the coupling constant . in @xcite only the @xmath87 component is included in the bound state wave function which might partly explain the smallness of their reported decay width .",
    "in @xcite the @xmath114 weights are similar to ours , being 89.4% and 10.4% for @xmath106 and @xmath88 , respectively . compared to @xcite",
    ", we do not take into account the @xmath115 state of the deuteron ( our parity - conserving @xmath9-@xmath9 interaction is designed for a pure @xmath75-state deuteron ) . according to @xcite , inclusion of the deuteron d - state increases @xmath104 by 50% .",
    "thus our decay width appears to be about a factor of two smaller than the estimate given in ref .",
    "@xcite which is partly due to the use of a too attractive scattering potential in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the present results , ref .  @xcite finds a substantial contribution of the @xmath29 term in the parity - violating interaction to the decay width .",
    "in summary , we have studied the parity - violating @xmath116 decay of the lowest @xmath1 state of @xmath2li within a microscopic multicluster model .",
    "we have performed a series of studies based on a three - cluster @xmath20 model space ( including all possible arrangement of the clusters and within each arrangement all relevant angular momenta ) and its extension to additionally include monopole breathing modes of the @xmath4 particle and the @xmath5h+@xmath5he rearrangement channel . for the parity - conserving interaction we used the minnesota force which reproduces all relevant subsystem properties reasonably well .",
    "we have calculated the decay width in perturbation theory , using a consistent description of the @xmath1 bound state and the final @xmath89 scattering state .",
    "we have found that the parity - nonconserving @xmath0 decay width @xmath103 is moderately sensitive to the correct reproduction of the experimental @xmath0 phase shift and the @xmath1 binding energy . on the other hand ,",
    "we have demonstrated that @xmath103 is very sensitive to the presence of the 1015% @xmath110 component in the bound state wave function .",
    "as the inclusion of @xmath4 breathing modes and the @xmath5h+@xmath5he rearrangement channel changes @xmath104 considerably , we find that dynamical degrees of freedom beyond the @xmath20 three - cluster space are quite important .",
    "the decay width in our most complete model , using the ddh best values for the weak coupling constants , is @xmath117 ev compared to the experimental upper limit @xmath118 ev .    our most important result , however , is that the state - of - the - art microscopic multicluster model does not constrain the parity - violating decay width of the @xmath119 state at @xmath120 mev in @xmath2li sufficiently well ; despite the fact that this model is very successful in simultaneously describing other low - energy properties of the six - nucleon system .",
    "we note that a similar sensitivity has already been observed in cluster model studies of the beta - delayed deuteron emission process in @xmath2he @xcite .",
    "improved dynamical calculations in larger six - body model spaces would be welcome to clarify the role of other degrees of freedom beyond our model , for example , by including the d - state components in the deuteron and @xmath4-particle .",
    "such calculations are , however , very challenging , as they have to consistently reproduce the spatially extended halo - like nature of the @xmath2li @xmath1 state and the @xmath121 scattering state .",
