    "turbulence is an essential property of interstellar medium , which controls a number of key astrophysical processes , including star formation , mass and heat transport and propagation of cosmic rays ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see review by @xcite ) .",
    "observational studies of turbulence can put constraints on theoretical expectations for such processes and clarify their physical descriptions .",
    "the advantage of obtaining the spectra of turbulence using the observations of doppler broadened lines was obvious from the very beginning of the research in the field ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the problem happened to be extremely difficult , however .",
    "fortunately , we have seen some progress in this field recently .",
    "for instance , the vca techniques for the analysis of turbulence from spectral data , developed by @xcite ( henceforth lp00 ) , is based on the analysis of fluctuations in channel maps .",
    "those can be viewed as slices of a position - position - velocity ( ppv ) cube .",
    "however , there exists a complimentary technique , employing statistics along velocity coordinate which has also been briefly discussed in that paper .",
    "this technique was introduced in the same ( lp00 ) paper , but was not appreciated enough at the time of its introduction .",
    "in fact , it happened that studying the spectra of channel maps was an adopted procedure well before @xcite posed a question what these fluctuations may mean in terms of the underlying turbulence . on the contrary , has been studying the fluctuations of ppv emissivity along the velocity coordinate until very recently ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as the result , the introduction of the technique was delayed .",
    "a detailed study of the technique , that was termed velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) ( lazarian 2004 ) , including the possible effect of absorption were presented in @xcite ( henceforth lp06 ) .",
    "however , there only a distant cloud is considered there as a possible turbulent volume for studies , which exclude the situation of not parallel lines of sight , which is typical , e.g. for studies of high latitude hi .    in the present paper",
    "we present a formalism that in a concise form allows to reproduce the earlier results in the field , as well as to move the field forward .",
    "the gist of our approach is formalization of the role of observational geometry , which allows us to write out the basic equations of both the vca and the vcs in a very similar way .",
    "our approach also enables us to account for a limited resolution , various beam geometries and , more importantly , account for both the crossing or parallel lines of sight geometry of observations . in other words ,",
    "unlike lp06 we can both consider turbulence studies within a distant cloud with size much larger than the distance to the cloud and the in volume that surrounds the observer .",
    "moreover , our general formalism can easily be extended for the intermediate cases , when lines of sight are not crossing , but can not be considered parallel either .",
    "we note , that the vcs is special among the techniques of turbulence studies .",
    "compared to the vca or velocity centroids ( see @xcite and references therein ) it uses exclusively data along velocity coordinate . in this case",
    "the spatial information is used for improving statistics only .",
    "our simulations in the companion paper confirm , that a very few independent measurements ( e.g. @xmath0 ) is sufficient to get the underlying velocity turbulence spectrum with enough accuracy .",
    "this tool is irreplaceable when we do not resolve the object enough to analyze power spectrum in the pictorial plane .",
    "in addition , our present study makes the vcs the only tool accounting for convergence of lines of sight .    in what follows in sect .",
    "[ sect : turb ] we introduce the basic terms of statistics of turbulence , in sect .",
    "[ sect : sline ] we describe the signal at a spectrometer output in terms of underlying velocity and emissivity fields , in sect . [ sect : cfs ] we consider the basic statistics common for vca and vcs , the power spectrum along the velocity coordinate is presented in sect . [",
    "sect : p1 ] and in sect .",
    "[ sect : p1_asy ] we consider its asymptotics .",
    "the variants of the geometric term are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : gc_all ] . some needed here facts regarding velocity and",
    "density statistics are presented in appendices [ sect : vst ] and [ sect : ecf ] , the influence of the regular velocity shear is considered in appendix [ sect : reg_vel ] .",
    "we discuss our findings in sect .",
    "[ sect : disc ] .",
    "we assume here , that turbulent velocity and density are homogeneous and isotropic and admit a statistical description in terms of correlation ( or structure ) functions and corresponding power spectra .",
    "the latter pair of functions is related to each other through fourier transform .    for a vector field like velocity ,",
    "correlation function and correspondent power spectrum take a tensor form .",
    "power spectrum is different for solenoidal and potential field components . for each case spectrum",
    "s tensor properties can be represented by a factor , depending only on angles .",
    "another , scalar , factor is responsible for energy distribution in the wavenumber space .    because of the self - similarity of turbulence",
    ", we usually expect a power law dependence for power spectrum",
    ". this power law can be either `` long wave dominated '' ( or `` steep '' ) if the respective spectral index is greater than @xmath1 , or `` short wave dominated '' ( or `` shallow '' ) otherwise ( see lp00 ) . to keep total energy limited , both types of spectrum must have a cutoff : at low wavenumbers for the steep one , and at high wavenumbers for the shallow one .",
    "we assume the velocity spectrum to be steep , as the shallow velocity spectrum is not physically motivated . on the contrary , for density spectrum we consider both steep and shallow spectra .",
    "the shallow spectrum emerges for high mach numbers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities we deal with in spectral line observations are velocity and emissivity .",
    "the latter can be proportional to density ( like in emission lines of neutrals ) or density squared ( dielectron recombination lines in plasma ) .",
    "the regime of squared density modifies the underlying density spectrum as the emissivity spectrum is an auto - convolution of the density one in this case : the asymptotic slope of the emissivity spectrum is the same for steep density spectrum and different , @xmath2 , for the shallow one ( see appx .",
    "[ sect : ecf_st ] ) .",
    "we are interested in velocity statistics , and emissivity is considered only because it affects the quantities , derived from observational data , that we use here . this influence is less for steep emissivity spectrum , and could be ignored ( apart from the normalization ) , but",
    "for the shallow spectrum it should be accounted for .    because of non - linear character of the statistics we use eq .",
    "[ [ eq : p1_fin ] ] , we can not directly recover the velocity spectrum .",
    "but if it is parametrized with the spectral index , spectrum amplitude , and cutoff wavenumber ( related to the injection scale ) , we in principle can recover these parameters .",
    "the presentation of the techniques in both lp00 and lp06 starts from presenting the underlying turbulence statistics and proceeds with introducing the observables . in such presentation of the vca and the vcs",
    "decouple rather early and the derivations are rather lengthy .",
    "below we provide a derivation of the relevant formulae starting from the output of a spectrometer .",
    "this allows us to present both the vca and the vcs within a unified approach .",
    "moreover , it allows us to cover the observationally important case of crossing lines of sight .",
    "however , unlike lp06 , we do not consider self - absorption , which means that our approach is applicable either to optically thin emission lines or to weak absorption lines .",
    "let us write out space - velocity distribution of density : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is maxwellian distribution @xmath5 and @xmath6 is an integral density .",
    "if we write out the similar expression for emissivity @xmath7 we will get @xmath8  for linear emissivity law , @xmath9  for quadratic emissivity law , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 set up the ratio between the quantities integrated over the velocity .",
    "then we can write out the following expression for the signal in a spectrometer channel centered at the velocity @xmath12 : @xmath13    where @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : effsens ] ] @xmath15 is the channel sensitivity function , @xmath16 is the instrument beam , @xmath17 is the integral emissivity , @xmath18 is the turbulent velocity radius - vector projection , @xmath19 is the regular velocity radius - vector projection and @xmath20 is the wavelength of the spectral line .    in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : sig ] ] it is assumed that the following normalization is applicable : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    the principal quantity in our analysis , @xmath23 is measured in @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is in @xmath26 , @xmath20 is in @xmath27 and @xmath28 is in @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that the instrument aperture efficiency is @xmath30 .",
    "random field @xmath17 is not homogeneous , at least because the emitting structure is limited in space . to model",
    "this we introduce a homogeneous field @xmath31 and a deterministic factor @xmath32 setting up borders of an observed object .",
    "we will also `` pack '' into @xmath31 all constant factors : @xmath33 it is also convenient to introduce a window function @xmath34 as follows : @xmath35 with these notations we finally obtain : @xmath36 in what follows we shall consider the fourier transform of spectral line plays here the role of @xmath37 in lp00 , being however different in dimension ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we use it here to avoid complications when @xmath39 . ] : @xmath40 this function can be easily determined from observational data .",
    "a signal in a channel @xmath41 received from a point object with the flux @xmath42 is as follows : @xmath43 then the signal can be written as an integral of @xmath44 weighted with the channel sensitivity function @xmath45 : @xmath46 and , if we make the following substitution is a homogeneous field and @xmath47 is a correspondent window function ] @xmath48 and keep only the variable term of @xmath49 with inverted sign , we will have : @xmath50 the correspondent fourier transform is : @xmath51 the observational configuration for this regime is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] .",
    "let us consider the following measure : @xmath52 where indexes 1 and 2 designate different beam directions .",
    "we have assumed here that density and velocity are uncorrelated .",
    "the effects of such correlation have been studied analytically in lp00 and numerically in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they were shown to be marginal .",
    "the first averaging gives us an emissivity correlation function @xmath53 .",
    "averaging of the exponent can be performed with assumption that the velocity field has gaussian statistics : @xmath54    to proceed we assume that the beam separation as well as the beam width is small enough to neglect the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( we consider @xmath57-axis to be a bisector of the angle between beams ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath58 depends only on @xmath57 and admits a linear approximation : @xmath59    this leads us to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a velocity structure tensor projection : @xmath62 assuming that the velocity field is homogeneous .",
    "having substituted @xmath63 , we can write the following expression for @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 which will be further referred to as `` geometric term '' .    the case @xmath67 leads us to the vca is a 2-d vector in picture plane , @xmath68 is defined in sect.[sect : gc_irp ] ] , while making the two beams coincide , we turn to the vcs .",
    "setting @xmath69 in eq . [ [ eq : k12_fin ] ] we can write : @xmath70 where @xmath71    some variants of @xmath72 are presented in appendix [ sect : gc_all ] .",
    "we get an important case of infinite resolution after applying of @xmath73-function in @xmath72 from appendix [ sect : gc_irp ] :    @xmath74    in particular , it arises when using an absorption line [ [ eq : sig_abs_rat ] ] from distant point sources behind the studied turbulent cloud ( see fig .",

    "another important case arises when the emissivity spectrum is shallow and @xmath75 splits into constant and singular terms : @xmath76 and @xmath77 is splitted accordingly : @xmath78    in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : p1_split ] ] the first term with the exception of its amplitude is entirely determined by velocity field , while the other one depends on both emissivity and velocity .",

    "the cases presented below roughly cover all possible geometrical configurations , which include on the instrument beam shape and relative location of the observed turbulent structure .",
    "each of these variants of geometric term has different behavior for @xmath79 ( see tab .",

    "it can happen that the asymptotic regime is not achieved because of thermal smoothing of the spectral line , or low spectrometer resolution . in this case we can calculate velocity field parameters by fitting of the model @xmath77 to the data with different spacial smoothing .",

    "[ fig : shear ] .",
    "another important case for using the vcs can be the studies of turbulence in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "such studies can utilize x - rays , but in most cases the spatial resolution of telescopes may not be adequate to get channel maps with a sufficient spatial resolution .",
    "as discussed earlier in lp06 , the inertial range observed with the vcs may be somewhat limited .",
    "some extension is possible by using heavier species , for which the thermal broadening is reduced .",
    "another way that we explore in practical terms in @xcite is fitting the data with a model and using the vcs formulae directly , rather than their power - law asymptotics .",
    "naturally , the vcs is a complementary technique to the vca and their use can improve the reliability of interpreting fluctuations in the shapes of doppler broadened lines in terms of underlying spectra of turbulence .",
