    "the electronic response function at low energies is a standard tool to address the physical mechanism leading to the exotic macroscopic properties observed in complex materials .",
    "the onset of superconductivity , charge density wave or giant magnetoresistance , which arise from both the electron - electron interactions as well as from the interactions between electrons and other degrees of freedom , is often reflected in anomalous features in the low energy electronic response function  @xcite . in those systems , the population dynamics and the electronic gaps are often not `` factorizable '' , i.e. the excited state population dynamically renormalizes the electronic gaps  @xcite .",
    "this aspect makes time - resolved photoemission particularly appealing among non - equilibrium techniques , as it allows to simultaneously measure the time - dependent band structure and the evolution of the non - equilibrium distribution of electronic excitations .",
    "various time- and angle - resolved photo - emission experiments have revealed the collapse of charge density waves and mott gaps  @xcite or the reconstruction of the gap at photo - induced metal - insulator transitions  @xcite .",
    "time domain pump and probe photo - emission spectroscopy suffers from the intrinsic limitation imposed by energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "in fact , although nowadays we have technologies to produce light pulses shorter than 100 attosecond  @xcite , the shorter the pulses are , the larger is their bandwidth . in standard time domain photoemission experiments",
    "the large energy content of the probing pulse maps directly onto a large spread in the energy content of the photo - emitted electron .",
    "this results in a poor energy resolution that averages out the spectroscopic feature associated to low energy gaps .    for this reason up to",
    "now , time domain studies have been limited to study the dynamics of spectral features which are slower than the inverse of their characteristic frequency . in general",
    ", one could say that the time - evolution takes place _ beyond the spectral uncertainty limit _ if relevant degrees of freedom evolve faster than the inverse width of their spectroscopic fingerprint .",
    "a paradigmatic example of such situation is the kondo effect , i.e. , the screening of an impurity magnetic moment , which is reflected only in a narrow spectral feature close to the fermi energy : since a pulse of duration @xmath0 has a minimum bandwidth @xmath1 , it is generally believed that the dynamics of the kondo screening can be measured only on timescales slower than the inverse of its spectral width , while it is known that the screening itself can evolve on a shorter timescale  @xcite .",
    "a similar issue can arise in the case of the condensate in standard bcs superconductors , whose dynamics is believed to be observable only on timescales which are slower than the inverse of the gap frequency , @xmath2 . on the other hand it is expected that gap amplitude oscillations at the gap frequency should follow a sudden quench of the superconducting gap  @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we show that the tradeoff between the resolution on the photoelectron energy and the temporal resolution is a characteristic of standard pump - probe photoemission performed with pulses with gaussian envelopes , and that it can be circumvented using properly shaped light pulses . here , we extend the well established concepts of multidimensional optical spectroscopy  @xcite to time - resolved photoemission experiments .",
    "the idea leading this theoretical proposal is that the full information about the single particle dynamics in the solid , contained in the green s function @xmath3 , can be accurately characterized entirely in the time domain and the limitations of the mixed time - frequency approach used in standard time domain experiments can be overcome . in particular , we show that a real - time measurement of the green s function can be experimentally implemented using the interference photo - emission signal from a double probe pulse , obtained by splitting , delaying and recombining a pulse of arbitrarily short duration .",
    "we illustrate this double probe pulse photo - emission scheme addressing the buildup time of the kondo peak and highlight how this scheme could have a more general relevance for experiments addressing the true timescales of destruction of electronic order in mott insulators such as 1@xmath4-tas@xmath5 dichalcogenide  @xcite and superconductors  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the experiments exploiting the modulation of the classical intensity we envision experiments taking advantages of light pulses with statistical or quantum correlations . exploiting quantum correlations of light both in controlling and measuring the properties of matter has a wide application in other fields  @xcite .",
    "our proposal represents the first attempt to exploit non - coherent states of light to address specific spectroscopic features in time - resolved photoemission experiments .",
    "in a time - resolved angle - integrated photoemission experiment , one measures the probability @xmath6 that an electron is emitted under the action of a short probe pulse , as a function of the photoelectron energy @xmath7 and the time - delay @xmath8 between the probe pulse and a given excitation ( e.g. the pump pulse ) .",
    "the signal @xmath6 can be obtained using time - dependent perturbation theory in the light - matter coupling @xcite . if @xmath9 denotes the time - profile of the probe vector potential with envelope @xmath10 and centre frequency @xmath11 , one obtains ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix [ appendix : derivation ] ) @xmath12 here the kinetic energy @xmath7 is defined with respect to the energy @xmath13 given by the frequency @xmath11 and the work function @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is an autocorrelation function of the probe pulse , which acts as a _ filter _ determining how @xmath16 is sampled over the @xmath17-plane in the above integration .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 is the green s function of the sample alone , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for an electron in a given orbital of the system , @xmath21 denotes the expectation value in the initial state ( at @xmath22 ) , and the time evolution includes all nonequilibrium perturbations besides the probe , such as external pump laser fields . equation can easily be extended by adding a sum over orbitals and matrix elements , but the latter are static and do not alter the following general discussion of the relation between the time - dependent electronic properties and the photoemission signal .",
    "similarly , by inserting suitable matrix elements the results discussed in this work can be reformulated for angle - resolved photoemission  @xcite .",
    "if the probe pulse is modelled by a gaussian @xmath23 with duration @xmath0 , eq .   can be transformed into a mixed time frequency representation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wigner transform of the green s function , which could be referred to as a time - dependent occupied density of states .",
    "( at equilibrium , @xmath26 is the product of the spectral function @xmath27 and the fermi distribution function . )",
    "equation   emphasizes the origin of the uncertainty limit in time - resolved photoemission : the signal @xmath28 is related to the underlying spectral information @xmath29 by a filter which is subject to the uncertainty @xmath30 in ( @xmath31 ) plane .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the relative difference of carrier envelope phase between the two probe pulses , and @xmath47 is the temporal separation .",
    "using eq .  , the photoemission intensity obtained with this double pulse is given by the sum of the photoemission @xmath48 obtained with the individual pulses @xmath49 as if they were used separately , and an _ interference signal _ @xmath50 .",

    "note that @xmath46 is the relative difference of carrier envelope phase between the two probe pulses , and not an absolute carrier envelope phase .",
    "therefore , if the phase relation between the two probes is fixed , @xmath52 does not vanish upon averaging over many laser shots . as an example , if the probe photon energy is 6 ev ( @xmath53 200 nm ) , the stability of the mirrors of the delay stage in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] controlling @xmath43 should be of approximately 100 nm .",

    ", the diagonal terms @xmath58 can be obtained from an independent measurement with a single probe pulse experiment . even without any knowledge of the relative phase @xmath46",
    ", one can thus obtain the absolute value @xmath59 by varying @xmath8 and @xmath43 .    in section  [ sec : kondo ] we will demonstrate , for the example of the buildup of the kondo peak , that this information is valuable to extract key features of the ongoing dynamics of the system , that are otherwise hidden by the uncertainty limit of standard probe pulses .",
    "the double probe measurement scheme may therefore open the path for the application of extremely short pulses to study the dynamics of emergent low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "it can be noted that the coherence time of the features one wants to observe should be long enough to allow such two - probes measurement .",
    "however , the cases in which the double probe scheme is useful are exactly the ones in which the spectral features are sharp and , therefore , long - lived .    in the past ,",
    "pioneering works  @xcite explored the possibilities of time - resolved _",
    "two_-photon photoemission , which uses two delayed pulses with energies ( @xmath603 ev ) _ below _ the work function of the sample to populate empty states and then photoemit electrons from there .",
    "the study of interferometric effects allowed to measure elastic and inelastic scattering rates of excited states at the surface of metals .",
    "it is important to underline the differences between this technique and the tomographic measurement proposed here . because time - resolved two - photon photoemission allows only to study states with energies within 3 ev from the vacuum level , i.e states that are not occupied at equilibrium , it probes a joint density of occupied and unoccupied states rather than the single - particle spectrum , and is therefore unsuited to study how the states below the fermi energy change after a general kind of excitation , e.g. in an out - of - equilibrium phase transition or in the modification of the low energy properties of the system .",
    "in contrast , in the tomography described in this work the interference comes from different pathways leading to the same _",
    "one_-photon photoemission event , which would allow to probe any bound state .",
    "although the discussion in section  [ sec : illustration ] is based on the double pulse scheme , we now complete the generalization of the photoemission process extending it to states of the probe pulse which are not coherent states @xmath61 , i.e. that have either statistical or quantum correlations .",
    "a coherent state @xmath61 is the closest quantum description of a classical wave and is therefore also called quasiclassical . while the double probe experiment allows to reconstruct @xmath3 over the full @xmath17 plane through a tomographic process , the manipulation of the state of the probe pulse beyond the coherent state - case can allow to retrieve specific correlations in a single measurement .",
    "again , the discussion starts from @xmath38 .",
    "the probe pulse defines a filter @xmath38 in the time - domain [ eq .  ] or correspondingly in the time - frequency domain [ eq .  ] , which relates the signal @xmath6 to the dynamical information contained in @xmath39 .",
    "in the analysis discussed so far the pulse autocorrelation function is generally limited to a form @xmath15 which can be _ factorized _ in the time - domain . on the other hand , an arbitrary function @xmath38 could be designed to probe specific statistical features and correlations in the ongoing dynamics in the system . to see how such a measurement might be implemented",
    ", we first note that an arbitrary function of hermitian symmetry @xmath62 can be expressed , through diagonalization , as the sum of factorizable functions : @xmath63 where @xmath64 labels the eigenvectors .",
    "if more than one @xmath65 is different from zero , then @xmath38 is non - factorizable . from the above expression",
    "it can be seen that the result of the hypothetical photoemission with a non - factorizable filter @xmath38 would be a weighted average @xmath66 of signals obtained with different pulses @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the measurement can be emulated by an equivalent `` tomographic '' set of experiments with factorizable filters .",
    "the usage of a factorizable @xmath38 comes from the fact that in the standard case coherent states are considered for photoemission .",
    "this opens the intriguing question whether the hypothetical tomographic experiment described in the previous paragraph can be replaced by a single measurement performed with non - coherent states of light . in order to see",
    "what kind of filters @xmath38 one can obtain using general ( quantum or statistical ) probe pulses , we will now show what differences arise if a general state is considered for the light in the photoemission process .",
    "the derivation of the photoemission intensity for an arbitrary state ( described by the density matrix @xmath68 ) of the incoming probe pulse is rather analogous to the semiclassical case discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is therefore presented in the appendix . in the coulomb gauge ( @xmath69 ) , the vector potential @xmath70 is now given by an operator @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the photon annihilation operator . for notational simplicity",
    "we take into account only one propagation direction @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and transverse linear polarization . setting the location of the sample at @xmath77 , the only change in eq .",
    "is that the autocorrelation function @xmath38 takes its quantum - mechanical form @xmath78 in this context , classical coherent probe pulses can be described as a coherent state @xmath79 , which immediately recovers the standard result , with @xmath80 and probe envelope @xmath81 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the state of the probe pulses is not a product @xmath82 of coherent states , i.e. it is not a quasiclassical coherent wave , @xmath38 is not bound to the standard factorizable form . in fact , since the probe pulse only enters through the two - time correlation function , it can be shown that every function of the form can be obtained from eq .   with a multimode state with gaussian wigner function",
    "provided that @xmath83 , i.e. , the function is positive definite ( see appendix [ sec : squeezed ] ) . in this way , a tomographic set of measurements aimed at reconstructing the effect of a hermitian and positive definite filter @xmath38",
    "can , indeed , be replaced by a single experiment with probe pulses not in a coherent state . in turn , every measurement with non - coherent states can be replaced by a tomographic set of measurements with classical pulses , because any state of light @xmath68 can be expressed as an integral over coherent states using the glauber - sudarshan p representation  @xcite @xmath84 .",
    "the potential use of different filters @xmath38 to obtain specific informations , such as the wigner transform , is illustrated for the level quench in fig .",
    "[ fig : quantum]c , where we plot the result of eq .   with a particular choice of an exotic , but hermitian and positive definite cross - shaped @xmath38 .",

    "an incoherent light pulse has a reduced correlation between the various temporal positions in the pulse , as compared to coherent light . in the @xmath17 plane",
    ", @xmath38 must quickly go to zero moving away from the @xmath51 diagonal , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : quantum]d .",
    "this leads to a reduced frequency resolution [ fig .",
    "[ fig : quantum]d ] compared to the result obtained with a coherent pulse with the same intensity profile in time .",
    "in the following we illustrate the real - time measurement of the green s function with the double - pulse technique ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) for the buildup of a kondo resonance , which is a classical problem of nonequilibrium many - body physics and also a paradigmatic example of dynamics occurring beyond the spectral uncertainty limit .",
    "we start by discussing the results in standard photoemission .",
    "the kondo effect can arise when a localized orbital , such as a quantum dot or an impurity atom on a metallic surface , hybridizes with a continuum of conduction electrons @xcite . depending on the orbital occupancy , a magnetic moment",
    "is formed on the impurity when charge fluctuations are suppressed due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "this moment becomes screened by the conduction electrons below the kondo temperature @xmath86 , an emergent low energy scale of the system .",
    "the buildup of kondo screening in real time , e.g. , after the impurity is suddenly coupled to the conduction band , has recently been a subject of intensive numerical research @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic signature of the kondo effect is a narrow resonance of width @xmath86 at the fermi energy ( the so - called kondo peak ) , which can be resolved only after times @xmath87 @xcite , while the kondo screening cloud is formed to a large extent on the much shorter timescale set by the hybridization between impurity and conduction band @xcite .",

    "@xcite after the excitation with monocycle - like thz pulses , the transmittivity of the sample in the terahertz range oscillates at the frequency @xmath160 , as predicted for the excitation of the higgs amplitude mode .",
    "oscillations of the gap of a superconductor at its own frequency fall under the dynamics occurring at the spectral uncertainty limit .",
    "photoemission with the tomographic double probe scheme is therefore a potential way to characterize the dynamics without the energy - time uncertainty limitation .",
    "as the lesser green s function for laser - excited superconductors has been calculated theoretically , it would be interesting to evaluate the spectroscopic signature of the higgs oscillations within the two - probe technique , and thus stimulate corresponding experiments .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed possibilities to use time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy as a tool to probe the evolution of the electronic structure fully in the time - domain .",
    "whenever relevant degrees of freedom evolve on timescales comparable to or faster than the inverse width of their spectral signatures , such a pure real - time characterization can provide more insight than a measurement in the usual mixed time - frequency domain , which requires a tradeoff between temporal and spectral resolution .",
    "in particular , we proposed a double probe pulse technique , which can be used to probe the dynamics of low - energy degrees of freedom with arbitrarily short pulses , possibly in the attosecond range , with a bandwidth that would not be able to resolve the respective linewidths in frequency space if the pulses were taken alone .",
    "the case of dynamics occurring _ beyond the spectral uncertainty limit _ is actually a quite common feature of correlated systems . as examples",
    ", we discussed the buildup of the kondo resonance , the melting of a mott gap , and the dynamics of a superconductor when the amplitde mode is excited .",
    "further examples include the melting of other types of electronic order such as spin - density wave gaps  @xcite and the buildup of screening and plasmon resonances ( in optics , the plasmon resonance at @xmath161 forms on a timescale @xmath162  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the use of quantum or statistical correlations in the light pulse would enhance the possibilities to characterize the dynamics with a time - resolved photoemission experiment .",
    "while this may seem technologically challenging at present , it contributes to the questions whether correlations of light can be exploited to enhance , in a similar way , the capabilities of time - dependent measurements in other spectroscopic techniques , such as two - photon photoemission or optical spectroscopy .",
