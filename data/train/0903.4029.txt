    "the @xmath4 classification of strongly - interacting particles originally proposed by gell - mann @xcite and zweig @xcite has been a very successful paradigm in particle physics .",
    "it is observed from the hadronic spectrum that the results following from this naive quark model ( nqm ) agree better with the heavy meson systems than the light ones .",
    "this is understandable because the heavy quarks inside a heavy meson are non - relativistic , and hence we can deal with their kinematics in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as a good approximation .",
    "however , for light mesons where the light components are relativistic , it is hard to say whether the nonrelativistic approximation is applicable .",
    "we can see that there is more complexity in light mesons than the heavy ones from the observed spectrum .",
    "the situation is even worse in combination with the proliferation of light scalars and their production in charmless @xmath5 decays . in order to accommodate these light mesons in theories consistent with qcd ,",
    "models beyond the naive quark model have been developed , including glueballs @xcite , multiquark states @xcite and hybrid states @xcite .",
    "one hopes that these models can supply some reasonable , or at least qualitative , explanation of the observed light mesons .",
    "the underlying structure of mesons with mass near 1 gev attract much attention .",
    "it has widely been suggested that the light scalars below or near 1gev [ the isoscalars @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the the isodoublet @xmath8(or @xmath9 ) and the isovector @xmath0(980 ) ] form a su(3 ) flavor nonet , while scalar mesons above 1gev [ @xmath10 , @xmath0(1450 ) , @xmath1(1430 ) and @xmath2(1500)/@xmath2(1710 ) ] form another nonet @xcite",

    "@xcite suggest that the light scalar nonet above 1gev can be accommodated in the conventional @xmath11 model with some gluonic component , while the light scalars around 1gev are dominated by @xmath12 states with some @xmath13 @xmath11 and glueball states .",
    "but this interpretation is still far from deciphering the puzzle presented by the light scalars .",
    "it is obvious that the starting point of all the models mentioned above concentrates on the kinematic aspect of the component inside the scalars , _",
    "i.e. , _ in order to reproduce the spectrum in theories consistent with qcd , the complexity of the light scalars is attributed to their constituents .",
    "maybe one can refer to this as a kinematics - dependent approach .",
    "there is another viewpoint we can adopt .",
    "we should recognize that in the hadronic region perturbative qcd breaks down , and the nonperturbative aspects of qcd are dominant .",
    "it is well - known the nonperturbative aspect of qcd is difficult to analyze .",
    "the nonzero quark condensate signals that the qcd vacuum is nontrivial and has a complex structure . in other word , the dynamics in qcd vacuum is very different from the trivial one .",
    "it is possible that the complexity of the light scalar mesons can be attributed to the enigmatic qcd vacuum , in which the particle treated as the excitation of the qcd vacuum from the viewpoint of quantum field theory .",
    "the nonzero value of qcd vacuum expectation values is one of the main ingredients of qcd sum rules @xcite which deals with the low energy nonperturbative aspects of qcd . in conventional qcd rules the physical quantities are expressed by a dominant perturbative part and corrections associated with vacuum expectation values of various operators .",
    "this method works well in many cases , but when we apply this method to the pions , it is difficult to obtain reasonable results .",
    "this difficulty was solved by introducing instanton contribution into the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "instantons  the nontrivial solution to the yang - mills field equation @xcite",
    " play an important role in solving the puzzle .. recent work involving qcd sum rules with instanton effects include the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite and glueballs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , instanton effects within qcd the non - strange sum - rules for scalar currents have previously been shown to split the degeneracy between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "all these works pave a new way to resolving the controversy concerning the nature of the light scalars .    comparing with the kinematics - dependent approach",

    "these two members are ideally suited to investigate the role of instantons in qcd sum rules , and we will analyze them in the naive quark model .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the @xmath15 because it is widely accepted that there is mixing with the isoscalar @xmath20 glueball ground state @xcite around 1500mev     because of this mixing , a more consistent analysis should consider the mixing of quark and gluonic content in analyzing @xmath2 meson .",

    "( 7 ) and applying the differential operator @xmath40 to them , we derive the desired mass formula which is free of the decay constant .",
    "the task now is to find ranges of parameters @xmath41 and the continuum threshold @xmath42 such that the resulting mass does not depend too much on the value of these parameters .",
    "in addition , the continuum contribution that is the part of dispersive integral from @xmath42 to @xmath43 subtracted from both sides of eq .",

    "we note that experimentally , except for the @xmath21 , there is a small mass difference between other members , and the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath44 is even smaller .",
    "thus it is reasonable to deal with them using the same threshold and borel window ; we think this criterion also holds true for other multiplets with small mass differences considered by other qcd practitioners . of course one can analyze each member of a multiplet with a separate threshold and borel window , but it is too artificial to be adopted because the sum rules are sensitive to the threshold . in considering this",

    "this suggests that important effects have been neglected in eq .",

    "the starting point on this subject is the solution of classical field equations in four dimension euclidean gauge - field theories given by belavin _",

    "using standard qcd sum - rule methodologies , we obtain the threshold @xmath86 , which is just below the next excited state @xmath87 , and the borel window is within the range [ 2.0 , 2.3]@xmath49 .",

    "the more important aspect observed from figure2 is that the calculated mass for @xmath19 and @xmath0 present the right picture : there is a range where the mass of the @xmath0 is larger than the @xmath19 , a result which can not be obtained in the sum rule without instanton contributions shown in figure1 . in other words ,",
    "the sum rule including instanton contributions can reproduce realistic results which in agreement with the light meson spectrum .    having determined the mass , it is straightforward to obtain the decay constant from eq .",

    "it is obvious that the results are very stable within the borel window , and from the figures we find the decay constants of @xmath19 and @xmath0 : @xmath95     with quark structure @xmath46 as function of borel parameter @xmath45 includes instanton . ]     with quark structure @xmath96 as function of borel parameter @xmath45 includes instanton . ]",
    "similarly if we set @xmath98 with isospin @xmath99 , we immediately get the mass of @xmath2 : @xmath100 at the `` key point '' i.e , @xmath101 , the mass is @xmath102 which is close to the experimental value of @xmath10 , while the more important result is that the mass of this state is no longer degenerate with other states .",
