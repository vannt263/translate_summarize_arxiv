    ", the density of the inner core of a typical ns can be several times the normal nuclear density @xmath8 , which is not yet achievable ( at least in a stable form ) in the terrestrial environment .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter in nss is often masked by various uncertainties in nuclear and particle physics , leading to the associated uncertainties in the physical characteristics of nss , including their masses , radii , and moments of inertia .",
    "thus , it has become a common practice for nuclear physicists to examine how eoss of high - density nuclear matter could affect the structure of nss , e.g. , the mass - radius relation , and systematic investigations along such direction have also been carried out ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , mass efforts have been pooled together to infer the details of nuclear matter from various possibly detectable characteristics ( such as mass , radius , moment of inertia and gravitational - wave spectrum ) of nss ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , paralleling these attempts to differentiate the structure of nss with respect to nuclear eos and vice versa , several universal eos - insensitive formulas connecting different physical parameters ( e.g. , mass , radius and moment of inertia ) of nss or quark stars ( qss ) have also been discovered .",
    "such formulas are important and useful as they enable astronomers to infer ( or at least to constrain ) a physical parameter of nss ( or qss ) from the others that are more amenable to physical measurement even in the absence of exact information of relevant eoss .",
    "for example , lattimer and schutz  @xcite and bejger and haensel  @xcite found formulas relating the moment of inertia @xmath1 , the mass @xmath9 , and the radius @xmath10 for nss constructed with different realistic eoss , which could be used to determine the moment of inertia of star a in the double pulsar system j0737 - 3039 @xcite to about 10% accuracy .",
    "besides , several universal behaviors of the quadrupolar @xmath0-mode oscillations of nss have been established and applied to infer the eos of nuclear matter @xcite , and similar studies have been extended to the quadrupolar and higher spherical order @xmath0-mode oscillations of rapidly rotating neutron stars @xcite    it is particularly interesting to note that some of these universal formulas actually relate the dynamical response of a ns ( or qs ) under external perturbation to its static stellar structure . in particular , lau , leung , and lin  @xcite found that the frequency and damping rate of @xmath0-mode quadrupole oscillation are expressible in terms of @xmath9 and the effective compactness @xmath11 , hereafter referred to as the  @xmath0-@xmath1 relations \" .",
    "hence , the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath1 of a ns ( or qs ) can be inferred accurately from the @xmath0-mode gravitational - wave signals @xcite . since pulsating nss",

    "the so - called `` @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations '' , discovered by yagi and yunes  @xcite , relate @xmath1 , the quadrupole tidal love number @xmath12 ( or , more precisely , tidal deformability @xcite ) , and the spin - induced quadrupole moment @xmath3 , with @xmath9 being a proper scaling parameter .",
    "the relations are robust and also prevail in several different situations , including binary systems with strong dynamical tidal field @xcite , magnetized nss with sufficiently high rotation rates @xcite , and rapidly rotating stars @xcite .",
    "besides , there are works extending the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations to consider the relation between higher - order multipole moments induced by either tidal forces or rotation @xcite .    similar to other universal relations ,",
    "these @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations enable us to infer any two of @xmath1 , @xmath13 and @xmath3 from the detected value of the remaining one even in the absence of prior knowledge of the eos of nss .",
    "in addition , the i - love - q relations could facilitate the analysis of gravitational - wave signals emitted during the late stages of ns - ns binary mergers @xcite , and also serve as an indicator to identify the validity of other modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the above - mentioned @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations were discovered separately , the moment of inertia @xmath1 is involved in both of them .",
    "it is physically natural to expect that there should be a link between these two relations .",
    "the present paper aims at examining their interrelationship and establishing universal relations that can directly link the characteristics of multipolar distortions induced respectively by oscillations and tidal forces together .",
    "first of all , we investigate the so - called `` @xmath0-love relation '' between the @xmath14th multipolar _",
    "f_-mode oscillation frequency @xmath5 and the @xmath15th multipolar tidal deformability @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "we show that there exist approximately eos - independent and relativistically correct relations between these two if @xmath18 , which are referred to as the diagonal @xmath0-love relations hereafter .",
    "it is obvious that the case with @xmath19 is a direct consequence of the original @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations @xcite . for the off - diagonal @xmath0-love relations with @xmath20 ,",
    "the relation between the two relevant physical quantities become more eos - sensitive ( see sec .",
    "iii and figs .  1 - 4 ) .",
    "this finding is important and useful . on the one hand , assuming that the mass of a ns is known from astronomical measurements , one can use the diagonal @xmath0-love relation to determine the _ f_-mode frequency from the measured tidal deformability in the same angular momentum sector @xcite ( and vice versa ) even in the absence of detailed knowledge of nuclear eos . on the other , the details of eos",
    "could be inferred from the off - diagonal @xmath0-love relations .    to pursue the physical origin of the eos - independency of the diagonal @xmath0-love relations , we compare the @xmath0-love relations of realistic stars and polytropic stars with those of incompressible stars ( see sec .",
    "iii and figs .  1 - 4 ) .",
    "we find that the latter can nicely approximate the behavior of realistic stars ( including both nss and qss ) and polytropic stars whose polytropic indices @xmath21 are less than 1 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the polytropic index of most ( if not all ) popular realistic nuclear eoss in the high density regime is less than 1 .",
    "hence , these prevailing eoss are stiff enough to guarantee the @xmath0-love relations except for nss with very low masses .",
    "if softer nuclear eoss were proposed and used to construct nss , such stars would demonstrate significant deviations from the @xmath0-love relation discovered in the present paper .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath0-love relations were violated , it would hint at the softening of nuclear matter due to physical mechanisms such as kaon condensation or other phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , regarding the physical origin of the multipolar @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath1-love and @xmath0-love formulas in the newtonian limit , we consider a model star characterized by a density profile @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the central density ( see sec .",
    "iv  a ) . here",
    "@xmath25 is a parameter controlling the stiffness of the star .",
    "with such a stellar model , we can approximately reproduce the behavior of qss and nss whose polytropic index is less than 1 , while rendering calculations of physical quantities more manageable and simplified ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "first of all , we analytically derive the @xmath0-@xmath1 formula relating @xmath5 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the @xmath28th mass moment ( see sec .",
    "iv  b ) , and the @xmath1-love formula connecting @xmath26 and @xmath6 ( see sec .",
    "in general , these two relations explicitly depend on the value of @xmath29 , i.e. , the underlying eos of the star , and lack of universality . however , if @xmath30 , to first order in @xmath29 both of them are independent of @xmath29 . consequently , combining the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love formulas , we can show that the diagonal @xmath0-love formula is also to first order independent of @xmath29 , corroborating the eos independence of the diagonal @xmath0-love formula discovered here ( see sec .",
    "iv  d ) .",
    "the analytic studies developed in the present paper clearly explain why these universal formulas are so insensitive to changes in eoss .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the crux of the observed universality is ( i ) these universal relations actually derive from the behavior of incompressible stars ; ( ii ) they are stationary with respect to changes in @xmath21 around the incompressible limit ( i.e. @xmath31 ) and hence are eos - insensitive ; and ( iii ) the prevailing eoss for nuclear matter are stiff enough to be considered as almost incompressible ( termed as quasiincompressible here ) in certain slow physical processes ( e.g. , @xmath0-mode oscillations , tidal and rotational deformation ) .",
    "physically speaking , if an external perturbation is applied to a compact star , the response of the star to such perturbation is given by the green s function , which consists of the contributions arising from different oscillation modes @xcite .",
    "tidal deformation of nss is merely the zero - frequency component of the green s function .",
    "we show in the present paper that for quasiincompressible stars in the newtonian limit , the tidal field couples only to the _ f_-mode oscillation and establish a robust @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation .",
    "such a relation readily shows that the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love relations imply each other , thus unifying these two independently discovered universal relations .",

    "when compact stars are perturbed away from their equilibrium state , their subsequent oscillations can be analyzed in terms of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) @xcite .",
    "each qnm is characterized by a complex eigenfrequency @xmath34 , with @xmath35 measuring its decay rate due to emission of gravitational waves . for typical nss , the oscillation frequency @xmath36 of the fundamental ( _ f _ ) mode usually lies in the kilohertz range , which is lower than other qnms such as the pressure ( @xmath37 ) modes and the spacetime ( _ w _ ) modes . hence , as far as gravitational waves emitted from oscillating nss are concerned , _",
    "f_-mode oscillations are most likely to be detectable with advanced gravitational - wave observatories such as the einstein telescope @xcite . owing to this ,",
    "numerous approximate formulas attempting to relate @xmath36 and @xmath38 of @xmath0-mode oscillation to other physical parameters of nss have been proposed @xcite . in most of these cases ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 were used as the independent parameters to express the @xmath0-mode frequency .",
    "it is not until lau , leung , and lin  @xcite introduced @xmath9 and @xmath1 as the two parameters to quantify quadrupolar @xmath0-mode oscillations and found two nearly eos - independent relations @xmath39 where the effective compactness @xmath40 replaces the role of the traditionally defined compactness @xmath41 .",
    "[ in ( [ eq : fmode_real ] ) we have corrected a typographical error in @xcite . ] as shown in table 1 of @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fmode_real ] ) and ( [ eq : fmode_img ] ) are more accurate than other universal relations using @xmath10 as a parameter .",
    "the typical deviation from the above two formulas for a realistic ns is less than a few percent . in the present discussion",
    "we focus our attention on ( [ eq : fmode_real ] ) and refer it as the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .    for a star with a given mass @xmath9 ,",
    "the effective radius @xmath42 measures its average size weighted by its mass distribution and is therefore more relevant to the dynamics of the star than the geometric radius @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the introduction of the effective compactness @xmath43 is expected to be a crucial reason to lead to the better performance of ( [ eq : fmode_real ] ) and ( [ eq : fmode_img ] ) .    on the other hand , owing to the frequency sensitivity limit of currently available gravitational - wave observatories , only the low - frequency part ( less than about 100 hz ) of gravitational waves emitted in the early stage of binary inspirals of compact stellar objects could be detected in the near future . however , as suggested by flanagan and hinderer  @xcite , such signals are still likely to be affected by the internal structure of the binary systems .",
    "for the same reason , it was proposed that the eos of nuclear matter could also be constrained from these gravitational - wave signals @xcite .",
    "in particular , the influence of stellar structure on the phase of gravitational - wave signal in the early stage of inspirals is uniquely determined by the quadrupole tidal deformability @xmath4 defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the traceless quadrupole moment tensor of the star and @xmath46 is the tidal field tensor inducing the deformation .",
    "besides , the term tidal love number @xmath47 ) is also often referred to in the literature @xcite .",
    "numerous investigations have been performed to study how the tidal deformability ( or love number ) depends on @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath48 and the eos . in general ,",
    "obvious eos dependence is observed if the tidal deformability ( or love number ) is considered as a function of any one of @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a set of almost universal relations , the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations , were discovered recently by yagi and yunes @xcite . in such relations ,",
    "three dimensionless scaled physical quantities , namely , the scaled moment of inertia @xmath49 , the scaled quadrupole tidal deformability @xmath50 , and the scaled rotational quadrupole moment @xmath51 , where @xmath3 and @xmath52 are , respectively , the spin - induced quadrupole moment and the angular moment of the star ( see , e.g. , @xcite for methods to evaluate these quantities in general relativity ) , are related through three nearly eos - independent empirical formulas , which can be cast into the following form @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are any two of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are some fitting coefficients ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , given any one of these three scaled quantities , the remaining two can be obtained .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations also imply that the degeneracy between the quadrupole moments and spins of nss in binary inspiral waveforms can be removed .",
    "hence , with the advent of second - generation gravitational - wave detectors , the averaged ( dimensionless ) spin of binary systems could be measured with accuracy up to @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "motivated by the possible applications of the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations in astrophysics , general relativity and fundamental physics , there has recently been a surge of interest in this field @xcite .    on the other hand , it is remarkable that @xmath55 considered in the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations is actually equal to the inverse square of the effective compactness ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) used in the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations ( [ eq : fmode_real ] ) and ( [ eq : fmode_img ] ) .",
    "this prompts us to study the possibility whether universal relations directly linking @xmath65 , @xmath57 and @xmath66 exist .",
    "an additional question also arises naturally .",
    "could such relations exist in higher - order multipoles ?",
    "the focus of the present paper is to perform an in - depth investigation on these issues .",
    "specifically , we study the so - called @xmath0-love relation between the @xmath0-mode frequency and the electric tidal deformability in the context of multipolar distortion in the following discussion .",
    "in the present paper , we adopted the convention introduced in @xcite to discuss multipolar tidal deformation .",
    "we consider the @xmath14th order electric tidal deformability ( see @xcite for its definition ) , @xmath6 , with @xmath14 being the angular momentum index of the tidal field in consideration , as well as the dimensionless @xmath14th order electric tidal deformability @xmath67 which is also related to @xmath14th order electric tidal love number @xmath68 through the relation @xcite @xmath69 as highlighted above , we investigate the relationship between the @xmath14th multipole scaled @xmath0-mode frequency @xmath70 and the @xmath15th multipole dimensionless deformability @xmath71 . in general , the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be distinct . in figs .",

    "save for some  atypical cases \" which will be further discussed later , the diagonal @xmath0-love relations again yield the smallest deviation from the incompressible limit and demonstrate the least dependence on the adiabatic index @xmath89 .",

    "general relativistical effects could apparently soften the stiffness of matter and lead to a smaller effective value of the adiabatic index ( see , e.g. , @xcite and chap .",
    "6 of @xcite for a heuristic explanation for the decrease in the effective adiabatic index due to gravitational effect ) .",
    "for example , nss with adiabatic index @xmath91 2 still become unstable towards the high compactness end as a result of the decrease in the effective value of @xmath89 .",

    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] .",

    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] . for all diagonal cases",

    "[ fig : k2_realistic ] ) and its magnitude decreases with the stiffness ( or @xmath89 ) of the eos . for nondiagonal cases showing @xmath85 in the plots of @xmath72 versus @xmath73 , if @xmath92 , the above - mentioned behavior of @xmath85 remains unchanged .",
    "in fact , @xmath84 also increases with @xmath14 for a fixed @xmath15 .",
    "however , the situation for cases with @xmath93 becomes more complicated . for the diagrams of @xmath85 with @xmath94",
    ", @xmath85 becomes positive although its magnitude still decreases with increasing stiffness ( or increasing @xmath89 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the  atypical cases \" with @xmath95 there are some crossings between lines representing eoss of different stiffness and the sign of @xmath85 is not uniquely defined .",
    "thus , the magnitude of @xmath85 is no longer a good indicator for the stiffness of eos .",
    "based on these observations , we figure out a phenomenological method , whose analytical basis will be provided in sec .  [ theory ] , to explain the above - mentioned behavior of @xmath85 .",
    "schematically we expand @xmath85 in power series of @xmath21 , @xmath96 where the coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath98 in general could also depend on @xmath71 , and only terms up to @xmath99 are kept in the expansion . as shown in figs .",

    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] in the newtonian limit ( see also table  [ tab : delta_square ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , for off - diagonal cases with @xmath92 , it follows from ( [ es-2 ] ) that @xmath85 is still negative and @xmath84 also increases with @xmath21 .",
    "complication arises for off - diagonal cases with @xmath108 .",
    "several situations could be possible .",
    "two of them are : ( i ) if either @xmath21 is small or @xmath109 is large , then the first - order term dominates the second - order term .",
    "consequently , @xmath85 is positive and increases with @xmath21 [ see the diagrams of @xmath85 with @xmath110 .",
    "( ii ) if the first - order and the second - order terms are of similar magnitudes , they could partly cancel each other out .",
    "hence , @xmath85 is not of a definite sign and its magnitude may be rather small due to the cancellation of these two terms .",
    "such is the explanation for the atypical cases mentioned above [ cases with @xmath111 .",
    "hence , in these atypical cases the magnitude of the deviation could not used as a direct measure of the stiffness of nuclear matter .",
    "however , ( [ es-2 ] ) has to be properly modified in order to account for relativistic effects . as can be observed from the diagonal cases in figs .",
    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] , for a fixed eos @xmath84 usually increases towards the maximum mass limit , which could be understood as the consequence of the general relativistical softening effect mentioned above .",
    "therefore , the polytropic index @xmath21 used in ( [ es-2 ] ) should be replaced by its modified value , which is expected to be larger than the original value .",
    "such replacement can qualitatively explain the increase in @xmath84 observed for dense stars .",
    "empirically , we find that the modified polytropic index @xmath21 increases by an amount of the order of the compactness of the star , which is in agreement with the post - newtonian analysis carried out in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a subtlety can also be observed from these figures especially for stiff stars in the small @xmath112 regime ( i.e. , dense stars ) .",
    "it seems that an extra anomalous ( positive ) contribution emerges in the right - hand side of ( [ es-1 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : k2_realistic ] , both the curves with @xmath113 cross zero in the small @xmath112 regime .",
    "we expect the magnitude of this extra term , which is more important for stiff stars , grows with compactness and leads to this anomalous behavior . however , the effect of this anomalous term is quite small and we can not extract its quantitative dependence from our data .    to sum up the above observations , we find that both realistic nss and qss obey the @xmath0-love universal relation as shown in figs .

    ", the mass moment @xmath123 in the former actually plays the role of @xmath9 in the latter .",
    "we have derived the @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation ( [ f - love - moment - dim ] ) from the gtm assumed above . however , to show the robustness of ( [ f - love - moment - dim ] ) , in the following we apply the linear response theory ( green s function method ) to quasiincompressible stars to develop an independent proof for it .    in newtonian theory , the steady state response of a star to an external time - dependent potential @xmath128 of frequency @xmath129",
    "can be obtained from the green s function method to be detailed as follows @xcite .",
    "first of all , the normal modes of a star are defined by the solutions to the eigenvalue equation : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the density distribution of the equilibrium state and @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the eigenfrequency and the lagrangian displacement of the @xmath28th ( @xmath134 ) oscillation mode carrying angular momentum @xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath136 case corresponds to radial oscillation , @xmath137 case usually represents translational motion , and for @xmath138 cases the star undergoes nonradial oscillations .",
    "unless otherwise stated explicitly , the @xmath139 component of angular momentum , @xmath140 , is suppressed in our equations .",
    "we adopt the convention where @xmath141 . for barotropic stars , which is always assumed in our analysis ,",
    "the 0th mode is the @xmath0 mode .",
    "besides , @xmath142 in general represents the net internal restoring force ( including pressure force and the gravitational force due to the star itself ) acting on a fluid element , which can be obtained from the lagrangian displacement @xmath143 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath144 can be found in @xcite .",
    "most importantly , @xmath144 is a hermitian operator guaranteeing the orthogonality relation of @xmath133 @xcite : @xmath145 where @xmath146 here denotes the volume of the star and the displacement fields are properly normalized to accord with ( [ ortho ] ) .    in the presence of an external time - dependent gravitational potential @xmath128 , the steady state linear response of the lagrangian displacement @xmath143",
    "is given by solution of the inhomogeneous equation @xmath147 the right - hand side of the above equation is actually the external gravitational force exerted on the star .",
    "expanding @xmath143 in terms of the complete set of @xmath133 and using ( [ eigen])-([steady ] ) , we find that @xmath148    in particular , if the external potential is a time - independent tidal potential in the @xmath14th ( @xmath149 ) multipolar sector , namely @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the standard spherical harmonics of angles @xmath152 and @xmath153 , a corresponding multipole moment defined by @xmath154 with @xmath155 being the eulerian change in density , is induced .",
    "the induced multipole moment in turn sets an additional potential @xmath156 outside the star .    in the linear response regime @xmath157 .",
    "the expansion in ( [ response ] ) then readily leads to @xmath158    so far the calculation has been exact up to the leading order of the perturbing potential . for @xmath0-mode oscillations of quasiincompressible stars , the lagrangian change in the density vanishes and hence @xmath159 .",
    "taking into consideration the fact that @xmath143 is derivable from a scalar potential ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we arrive at the approximate formula @xmath160 .",
    "we note that such approximation has been put forward by chandrasekhar  @xcite as the trial input of a variational principle , which is used in sec .",
    "[ f - love ] to evaluate @xmath0-mode oscillation frequencies . by orthogonality of the normal modes ,",
    "only the @xmath0 mode with the same angular momentum index @xmath14 has to be included in the sum in ( [ moment2 ] ) , and after integrating by parts , we show that @xmath161 by virtue of ( [ love ] ) , ( [ q - f - i ] ) and the definition of tidal love number @xcite , @xmath162 the general @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation involving three dimensionless quantities @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 @xmath166 is established , which holds for sufficiently stiff stars and @xmath167 .",
    "it is remarkable that ( [ f - love - moment - dim ] ) and ( [ f - love - moment ] ) are in fact equivalent to each other .",
    "while the former is a consequence of @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love relations , the latter is derived directly from the green s function method .",
    "given the @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation ( [ f - love - moment ] ) obtained from the linear response theory , the two seemingly independent @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love relations are in fact the consequence of each other for quasiincompressible stars characterized by stiff eoss .",
    "hence , the interrelationship between the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love relations is clearly shown from the @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation .",
    "although the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations have recently been discovered in the quadrupolar sector and various potential applications of them have been proposed @xcite , the reasons for the validity of these two relations and their interrelationship are not yet fully understood .",
    "yagi and yunes  @xcite suggested two possible reasons for the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations : ( i ) the relations are most sensitive to the stellar matter in an outer layer between @xmath168 and @xmath169 of the radius of a ns and the eos there is quite unified ; and ( ii ) the internal stellar structure of nss is gradually effaced as the black - hole limit is approached and hence nss reveal similar behavior . on the other hand , more recently yagi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations are actually dominated by the outer core lying in a region bounded between @xmath170 and @xmath169 of the stellar radius .",
    "however , given this finding , the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations can no longer be attributed to the similarity of eoss in the low - density regime .",
    "in addition , both @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations are valid for qss @xcite , whose eos and stellar structure are completely different from those of nss especially in the outer layer . formally speaking , the outer layer of bare qss can be considered as incompressible , while that of nss is rather soft with an adiabatic index of about 1.4 .    in the present paper",
    "we perform an in - depth examination on the relationship between the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 relations , in turn propose a robust multipolar @xmath0-love relation , and study the physical origin of these universal relations for compact stars in multipolar distortions .",
    "the multipolar @xmath0-love relation discovered here is generally valid in any angular momentum sector with @xmath149 ( albeit eos dependence increases with @xmath14 ) and for realistic compact stars ( including both nss and qss ) constructed with different prevailing nuclear eoss .",
    "we pinpoint that such universal behavior of realistic stars indeed follows closely that of incompressible stars , which are chosen as the standard to benchmark other stars . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] , as long as the polytropic index @xmath21 of a star is not greater than 1 , the fractional deviation in @xmath0-mode frequency , as compared with the incompressible counterpart , is less than @xmath171 and is inert to changes in @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we claim here that the stiffness of nuclear matter at large densities is the crux of these multipolar universal relations .    through the gtm , which is able to mimic realistic stars with @xmath172 , we carry out detailed newtonian analysis to show that both @xmath72 and @xmath173 are related to @xmath123 , the @xmath174th mass moment , in a way insensitive to changes in the parameter @xmath29 . hence , after eliminating @xmath123 from the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-love relations , the newtonian form of the diagonal multipolar @xmath0-love relation ( [ f - love-1 ] ) is readily established , which provides a strong support to the relativistic @xmath0-love relation discovered here . on the other hand , we also use the linear response theory to derive a @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation for newtonian stars with high stiffness ( say , @xmath175 ) .",
    "any two of the @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath1-love and @xmath0-@xmath1-love relations will imply the validity of the other one .",
    "more interestingly , in the @xmath0-love relation ( [ f - love-1 ] ) , the @xmath0-mode frequency and the tidal deformability are related with the mass as a parameter in the formula . however , in the @xmath0-@xmath1-love relation ( [ f - love - moment - dim ] ) the @xmath0-mode frequency , the tidal deformability and the @xmath174th mass moment are directly linked together in the absence of the knowledge of the mass .    in general , for nss far from their upper and lower mass limits , they are stiff enough to guarantee the universal formulas studied here .",
    "however , deviations from these universal formulas for stars with masses close to either of these two mass limits could arise for the following reasons . near the maximum mass limit",
    ", the strong gravitational attraction effectively softens the nuclear matter and hence the star can no longer be approximated by an quasiincompressible star . from figs .",
    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] , we can see that the magnitude of @xmath85 gradually grows larger and displays stronger dependence on the polytropic index as the star concerned approaches the maximum mass limit .",
    "in fact , such a softening mechanism seems to reduce the adiabatic index by an amount of the order of the compactness of the star @xcite and hence , following directly from ( [ es-2 ] ) , leads to larger deviation from the incompressible star . notwithstanding this",
    ", the universal formulas still hold around the maximum mass limit because the softening effect will at the same time destabilize the star @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the star becomes unstable before it could further deviate from the universal formulas . on the other hand , near the low mass limit",
    ", the star is primarily made of soft nuclear matter with adiabatic index @xmath176 and therefore deviations from the behavior of incompressible stars are expected and have been observed ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) . however , there is not much uncertainty in the eos of low - density ns nuclear matter , which is well studied .",
    "such deviations are unimportant and merely lead to modifications of the universal formulas instead of breaking them . on the other hand , nss and qss behave differently in the low - mass limit and hence do not follow the same universal formulas .",
    "researchers could make use of the difference in the universal trends obeyed , respectively , by nss and qss in the low - mass limit to distinguish these two kinds of compact stars .",
    "two kinds of universal relations have been studied here , namely the diagonal and the off - diagonal ones . in the former case",
    ", the scaled @xmath0-mode frequency @xmath72 and the scaled tidal deformability @xmath173 with the same angular momentum index @xmath14 are linked together in an almost eos - independent way . in the latter case , @xmath72 is related to @xmath177 with @xmath20 .",
    "however , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k2_realistic]-[fig : k5_realistic ] , such off - diagonal relations usually display stronger eos dependence . on the other hand , by combining these diagonal and off - diagonal relations , other off - diagonal relations , such as @xmath72 against @xmath178 , or @xmath173 against @xmath179 , with @xmath20 can be readily established .    to put our work into proper perspective",
    ", we note that several recent studies have been performed to extend the @xmath1-love-@xmath3 universality to multipolar sectors .",
    "for example , yagi  @xcite found that there exists certain degree of correlation between two tidal deformabilities with different angular momentum indices albeit with more obvious eos dependence . on the other hand , in an attempt to generalize the no - hair theorem for black holes to nss ( or qss ) , the so - called  three - hair theorem \" has been proposed @xcite , which states that higher multipole moments can be expressed in terms of just the mass monopole , spin current dipole , and mass quadrupole moments through eos - independent relations .",
    "however , the accuracy of the three - hair theorem was also found to deteriorate with the order of multipole . using the terminology coined here",
    ", we note that these two relations are actually off - diagonal ones , where more significant dependence on eos is expected according to our analysis .    for comparison ,",
    "we show here the other off - diagonal relation which connects @xmath72 of two different @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] , where @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) is plotted against @xmath66 for incompressible stars ( @xmath31 ) , and polytropic stars with @xmath182 . as discussed above , eos dependence of these off - diagonal relations become more obvious , especially for cases with larger difference in the two angular momentum indices .     against @xmath66 with @xmath183 ( black lines ) , @xmath184 ( red lines ) , and @xmath185 ( green lines ) for incompressible stars with @xmath31 ( solid lines ) , and polytropic stars with @xmath186 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath187 ( dot - dashed lines ) . ]",
    "finally , we remark that the present work is able to relate the multipole moments considered in the three - hair theorem @xcite to respective _",
    "f_-mode oscillation frequencies . since the multipole moments of compact stars could be inferred by measuring the atomic spectra observed from such stars with future x - ray telescopes such as loft and nicer @xcite , the relevant _",
    "f_-mode oscillation frequencies could likewise be derived from the @xmath0-@xmath1 universal formula .",
