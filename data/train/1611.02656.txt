    "the regulation of gene expression is essential for the maintenance of homeostasis within an organism . as such",
    ", the ability to predict which genes are expressed and which are silenced based on the cellular environment is of utmost importance to molecular biologists .",
    "mathematical models of gene regulatory networks have classically been framed as systems of differential equations that are derived from mass - action kinetics .",
    "the result is a complex system of equations that can not be solved explicitly , and involves many experimentally determined rate constants . in many cases , estimates of these constants in the literature",
    "may vary by orders of magnitude .",
    "the end result is a model which is quantitative by nature , but can only really be analyzed qualitatively , even if it can be solved numerically .",
    "these continuous models are still useful for understanding the mechanisms of regulation , but like any model , they have their strengths and weaknesses .",
    "an alternative approach is to use discrete models , such as logical models or boolean networks @xcite .",
    "these too have their drawbacks , but they have been shown to be useful tools when one is interested in analyzing the global - level dynamics of the system .",
    "the interested reader can consult @xcite for a nice survey in modeling gene regulatory networks , including both continuous and discrete models .",
    "the lactose operon in _ escherichia coli _ was the first gene regulatory network discovered , and francois jacob and jacques monod won a nobel prize in 1965 for their work on it @xcite .",
    "it is an example of an inducible operon under negative control , and a boolean network model was proposed by veliz - cuba and stigler in @xcite . in this paper , we propose a boolean model for the l - arabinose operon . while this operon is also used by _",
    "e. coli _ to regulate sugar metabolism , it contains several unique biological features such as a protein that can act both as a positive inducible control mechanism , and as a negative control mechanism by forming a dna loop to block transcription .",
    "as far as we know , our model is the first boolean network model of a system that uses dna looping to regulate transcription .",
    "we use computational algebra and sage to analyze our model , which has @xmath2 variables and @xmath3 parameters .",
    "this leads to @xmath1 possible initial conditions , and our analysis shows that for all of these , our model accurately predicts the biological behavior of the operon and also provides insight into interactions within the network .",
    "additionally , when there are medium levels of arabinose , the model predicts the observed bistability of the system .",
    "however , our model under synchronous update contains a few artificial cycles , but these go away when we look at a general asynchronous update scheme .",
    "this should serve as a cautionary tale as to how certain artifacts can arise from a synchronous update in a molecular network model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : ara - operon ] , we begin with a review of the biology of the _ ara _ operon , and we follow that with a review of boolean and logical models . finally , we propose our model and justify the choice of functions . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we convert our model into polynomials in @xmath4 $ ] and we show how to use sage to compute grobner bases to find the fixed points .",
    "we also use software such as adam @xcite , turing @xcite , and ginsim @xcite to verify that no other limit cycles exist .",
    "we explain how our model captures bistability , and discuss the dependence of the system dynamics on the whether the functions are applied synchronously or asynchronously .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of the results and future work .",
    "a core theme throughout molecular biology is the so - called `` central dogma '' , which explains how information flows from genotype ( the genetic code ) to the phenotype ( the observable physical characteristics of an organism ) @xcite .",
    "genetic information encoded in the nucleotides of the dna strand undergoes transcription , in which rna polymerase enzymes `` unzip '' the dna and read it , producing a messenger rna strand .",
    "this mrna then undergoes translation by ribosomes into an amino acid sequence known as a polypeptide , or protein .",
    "the functions of these proteins then lead to the phenotype .",
    "clearly this process requires extensive regulation , as the desire for presence or absence of a protein , as well as its concentration , are dependent on the current state of the organism and its environmental conditions .",
    "regulation of gene expression can occur at any of the steps during the flow of information , but the regulation of transcription in prokaryotic organisms has been particularly well - studied , and most of the early understanding of genetic regulatory systems came from the study of operons . an _ operon _ is a collection of contiguous genes with related functions that are all transcribed together onto a single mrna strand , along with two control sequences upstream of the genes .",
    "the genes in an operon whose protein products perform some coordinated function are known as structural genes .",
    "the two control sequences are a _ promoter _ ,",
    "a region of dna to which rna polymerase binds to initiate transcription , and an _ operator _ , a sequence of nucleotides located between the promoter and structural genes whose status determines whether transcription will occur .",
    "the state of the operator and its method of controlling gene expression can be categorized into one of four types .",
    "operons can be _",
    "inducible _ , which means that their `` default state '' is off , except when needed .",
    "the opposite is a _",
    "repressible _ operon , which means that the genes are transcribed unless there is a reason or need to turn them off .",
    "additionally , the method of regulation can be positive ( an activator protein binds to the operator to initiate transcription ) or negative ( a repressor protein binds to the operator to prevent transcription ) .",
    "one of the most well - studied prokaryotic organisms is _ e. coli _",
    ", a rod - shaped bacterium commonly found in the gut of mammals and birds .",
    "it has a short genome which has been fully sequenced , and its physiology is well - understood . since _",
    "e. coli _ lives in the intestines , its nutrition depends on the diet of its host .",
    "for example , if the host consumes milk , then _",
    "e. coli _ is exposed to lactose , or milk sugar .",
    "lactose can be used as an energy source , but gene products such as proteins and enzymes are needed to carry out tasks like transporting the molecules into the cell and then breaking them down .",
    "these gene products are not needed and therefore will not be produced if lactose is not available .",
    "the genes that regulate this make up the _ lac _ operon , and it is an example of an inducible operon with negative control .",
    "it was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be completely understood , and it is the prototypical example of a gene regulatory network .",
    "as such , it is standard material in introductory molecular biology classes , and is used as test cases for new modeling paradigms .",
    "lactose is just one of many sugar molecules that _ e. coli _ can use as an energy source .",
    "another is the five - carbon sugar l - arabinose ( the l- prefix stands for _ levorotation _ , which describes its chirality ) , and its metabolism into carbon and energy is also controlled by the gene regulatory network called the _",
    "ara _ operon .",
    "both lactose and arabinose are complex sugar molecules which need to be broken down before they can be used for energy .",
    "glucose , a more simple molecule , is a preferred energy source because it does not have to be modified to enter the respiratory pathway .",
    "thus , the _ lac _ and _ ara _ operons should be off if glucose is present .",
    "the _ ara _ operon contains three structural genes , called _ arabad _ ( that is , the adjacent _ ara _ genes b , a , and d )",
    ". transcription of these genes is controlled by the promoter @xmath5 .",
    "these genes code for thee enzymes which catalyze the following reactions needed for arabinose metabolism : the isomerase araa converts l - arabinose to l - ribulose , the kinase",
    "arab phosphorylates l - ribulose to l - ribulose - phosphate , and finally the epimerase arad converts l - ribulose - phosphate to d - xylulose - phosphate , which then enters the pentose phosphate pathway .",
    "in addition to the enzymes needed to metabolize arabinose , proteins are needed to transport it through the cell membrane .",
    "this is controlled by two different transport systems , both located upstream from the ara operon .",
    "the _ arae _",
    "gene produces arae , a membrane - bound protein that functions as a transporter in a low affinity transport system , and the _ arafgh _ genes which produce three corresponding proteins that together form a high affinity transport system known as an atp - binding cassette .    like the _ lac _ operon ,",
    "the _ ara _ operon is an inducible operon , but it differs in that it has both positive and negative regulation .",
    "specifically , the expression of the structural genes ( _ arabad _ ) is regulated by the protein arac , which can function as either a repressor or an activator depending on the intracellular concentrations of arabinose .",
    "the cell maintains a small amount ( approx .",
    "20 molecules ) of arac at all times , which binds to two sites @xmath6 , @xmath7 on the dna strand that causes a dna loop structure , as shown in the image on the left in figure  [ fig : ara - operon ] .",
    "this loop acts as a _",
    "repressor _ of transcription of both the _ arabad _ genes and the _ arac _ gene by physically blocking rna polymerase from attaching to either promoter sequence .",
    "this method of repression is quite different than the method used in the _ lac _ operon , where a repressor protein binds directly onto the dna strand to block transcription .",
    "however , the end result is the same .",
    "if extracellular arabinose is present , some molecules can be transported into the cell via passive transport .",
    "once intracellular arabinose is available , these molecules will bind to the arac protein and cause it to undergo a conformational change , which leads to it dissociating from the @xmath7 operator site and subsequently binding to the @xmath8 site .",
    "this is shown in the image on the right of figure  [ fig : ara - operon ] . in this arabinose - bound form ,",
    "arac now functions as an activator and induces binding of rna polymerase to the @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 promoter regions .",
    "transcription can now begin .",
    "in fact , the arac protein was the first known positive regulator in an operon , which was verified in the early 1970s @xcite .",
    "later experiments @xcite , @xcite uncovered the full structure of the operon ; see @xcite for a gentle survey article .        since glucose is the preferred energy source to arabinose , it must play a role in regulating the transcription of the _ arabad _ structural genes , and it does this via a method called _",
    "catabolite repression_. in addition to the arabinose - bound arac protein , a second activator known as the cyclic amp catabolite activator protein complex ( or camp - cap complex ) must bind to the promoter region to cause the dna to undergo further conformational changes to allow the binding of rna polymerase .",
    "one can think of this complex as a `` key '' which is required for transcription to begin .",
    "the presence of glucose inhibits the production of camp , which reduces the concentration levels of the camp - cap complex , thereby preventing transcription of the _ ara _ operon .",
    "operon not only uses catabolite repression , but also a form or repression called _ inducer exclusion _ , where glucose binds to the transporter protein , causing a conformal change in preventing lactose from entering the cell .",
    "this mechanism is not used in the _ ara _ operon @xcite , which actually makes modeling it more delicate .",
    "molecular networks have been classically modeled using continuous methods , such as systems of differential equations .",
    "examples of this for the _ lac _ operon can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the first boolean network model of the _ lac operon _ was published in 2011 @xcite .",
    "boolean network models were first proposed in 1969 by theoretical biologist s.  kauffman @xcite as models of gene regulatory networks . in 1973 , biologist ren thomas published a discrete formalization of biological regulatory networks that are often called _ logical networks _",
    "@xcite , and these continue to be studied and used in modeling today .",
    "the framework starts with a finite set @xmath12:=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] of nodes , each one having a state @xmath13 in a finite set @xmath14 .",
    "the case of each @xmath15 is a _",
    "boolean network_. these are the most common , and henceforth , we will assume that @xmath16 .",
    "each node also has an _ update function _ @xmath17 that updates its state based on the states of the other nodes .",
    "the update functions are then put together to generate the global system dynamics which can be encoded by a directed graph called the _ phase space_. there are several ways to do this , but in all of them , the vertex set is the set of global states @xmath18 , and the edges represent transitions between states .    the two basic ways to generate the dynamics are by applying the update functions synchronously or asynchronously . in a synchronous update , the _ dynamical system map _ @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 .",
    "this defines a discrete - time dynamical system , and so the phase space consists of the @xmath21 edges of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "every node has one outgoing edge , and the periodic points are those on simple cycles ; those of length @xmath24 are called _",
    "fixed points_. one advantage of a synchronous update is the local functions and dynamical map are multivariate polynomials over @xmath25 , and so this opens the door to using the rich toolbox of computational algebra to study biological systems .",
    "this algebraic approach has been used extensively by r.  laubenbacher and his collaborators ; see @xcite , @xcite for an overview . for example , when reverse - engineering a model from data , the model space consists of the sum of the vanishing ideal and a particular solution .",
    "approaches to the model selection problem include computing an ideal and its primary composition @xcite , or computing a grbner fan , selecting the cone with maximum weight , and then computing the grbner normal form of the corresponding grbner basis @xcite .",
    "one major drawback to this approach is that molecular networks do not have a `` central clock '' that updates every component synchronously ",
    "different gene products may have vastly different timescales , and there is always a degree of randomness involved .",
    "therefore , many logical network models assume a _",
    "general asynchronous update_. in this case , the phase space consists of the @xmath26 edges of the form @xmath27 , though self - loops are frequently omitted . the time - evolution of the global system state can be described as a walk on the phase space . with probability @xmath24 ,",
    "a `` random walk '' will end up in a maximal strongly connected component that has no out - going edges .",
    "these could be fixed points or cycles ( called _ cyclic attractors _ ) , but they can also be more complicated subgraphs called _ complex attractors _ @xcite .    regardless of whether the update functions are composed synchronously , asynchronously , or in some other method , the _ wiring diagram _ is defined to be the graph with vertex set @xmath12=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] and a directed edge from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( or @xmath13 to @xmath30 ) if the function @xmath31 depends on @xmath13 .",
    "such an edge is _ positive _ if @xmath32 and _ negative _ if the inequality is reversed .",
    "positive edges are typically denoted as    \\(a ) at ( 0,0 ) @xmath13 ; ( b ) at ( 1,0 ) @xmath30 ; ( a ) to ( b ) ;    , and negative edges as    \\(a ) at ( 0,0 ) @xmath13 ; ( b ) at ( 1,0 ) @xmath30 ; ( a ) to ( b ) ;    or @xmath33 {        \\node ( xi){$x_i$ } ; \\node ( xj ) [ right of = xi ] { $ x_j$ } ;        \\draw [ -| ] ( xi ) -- ( xj);}$ ] .",
    "of course , edges can be neither positive nor negative , though most interactions in molecular networks are one or the other  either activation or inhibition @xcite .    early work on boolean networks focused on models of well - known biological networks , as well as which network motifs in the wiring diagram can lead to common biological phenomenon . in 1981 , thomas conjectured @xcite that positive feedback loops are necessary for the dynamics to exhibit _ multi - stationarity _",
    "( having multiple fixed points ) and negative feedback loops are necessary for cyclic attractors . in this context , a feedback loop is a directed cycle in the wiring diagram , and it is positive if it consists of an even number of negative edges , and odd otherwise .",
    "biologically , a fixed point describes a biological steady state such as phenotype , and a cyclic attractor can describe a biological phenomenon like a cell cycle or homeostasis .",
    "thomas conjectures have been proven for both continuous systems such as differential equations ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as discrete system such as logical or boolean networks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to show that fixed points do not depend on the update order .",
    "additionally , one can make a case that due to the robustness of biological systems , issues such as timing should not affect the long - term dynamics .",
    "however , a synchronous update can introduce artifacts into the phase space .",
    "a simple example of this is shown in figure  [ fig:2-node ] . alternatively",
    ", non - determininstic versions of discrete models have been developed and studied .",
    "examples include probabilistic boolean networks @xcite and stochastic discrete dynamical systems @xcite .",

    "this was done in 2011 by veliz - cuba and stigler @xcite .",
    "we will begin by summarizing their work here in a few sentences , and then carry out a similar undertaking for the _ ara _ operon . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a model of the _ lac _ operon with 10 boolean variables that represent relevant gene products ( mrna , enzymes and proteins ) and intracellular lactose . for most of these",
    ", one can think of @xmath40 as denoting `` absent '' or `` low ( basal ) concentration '' , and @xmath24 as denoting `` present '' or `` high concentration '' .",
    "a system state is thus a vector in @xmath41 , and they use a synchronous update @xmath42 to get a dynamical system map @xmath43 . additionally , their model has three parameters : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , which are treated as constants and appear in some of the update functions .",
    "extracellular glucose is either present ( @xmath47 ) or absent ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "concentration levels of extracellular lactose can be one of three levels , which are described using two boolean variables .",
    "the variable @xmath45 means `` high levels of extracellular lactose '' and @xmath46 means ( at least ) medium levels .",
    "together , they describe high levels by @xmath49 , medium by @xmath50 , and low ( basal ) levels by @xmath51 . the fourth possibility , @xmath52 ,",
    "is ignored because it is meaningless .",
    "this gives six possible values for the parameter vector @xmath53 , each representing an _ initial condition _ of the model .    for five of the six initial conditions ,",
    "the authors verify that the phase space consists of exactly one basin of attraction ( connected component ) with one fixed point .",
    "each of these fixed points either corresponds to the _ lac _ operon being either off or on , and each bit of the vector matches exactly what one should expect biologically .",
    "the sixth initial condition , when @xmath54 represents medium levels of extracellular lactose and no glucose . in this case , there are two basins of attractions and two fixed points , one off and one on .",
    "this represents the important biological phenomenon of bistability .",
    "we will describe this in more details later , because it also arises in our model of the _ ara _ operon .",
    "our model of the _ ara _ operon consists of nine boolean variables and four parameters ( or constants ) , which differ from the variables primarily in the time - scales over which they change .",
    "for example , the presence of extracellular glucose or arabinose can certainly change , but it might do so on the scale of hours .",
    "in contrast , the concentrations of enzymes , proteins , or mrna may change on a scale of seconds or minutes .",
    "thus , we consider extracellular glucose and arabinose to be parameters of the model , and the concentration of the gene products as variables .",
    "we also define a parameter for the unbound arac protein , since the gene that codes for it is not part of the operon .",
    "our model uses the following boolean parameters :    * @xmath55 extracellular arabinose ( high levels ) * @xmath56 extracellular arabinose ( at least medium levels ) * @xmath57 arac protein ( unbound to arabinose ) * @xmath58 extracellular glucose    the subscript @xmath59 denotes medium concentration , and allows us to distinguish between three levels of arabinose concentration",
    ". low or `` basal '' levels occur when @xmath60 , medium levels when @xmath61 , and high levels when @xmath62 .",
    "the fourth case , when @xmath63 can be ignored , as it is meaningless .",
    "next , we define the following boolean variables :    * @xmath64 mrna of the structural genes ( @xmath65 ) * @xmath66 mrna of the transport genes ( @xmath67 ) * @xmath68 enzymes araa , arab , and arad , coded for by the structural genes * @xmath69 transport proteins , coded for by the transport genes * @xmath70 intracellular arabinose ( high levels ) * @xmath71 intracellular arabinose ( medium levels ) * @xmath72 camp - cap protein complex * @xmath73 dna loop * @xmath74 arabinose - bound arac protein    the variable @xmath75 is @xmath24 if the dna is looped , and @xmath40 if it is not looped .",
    "all of the other variables represent concentration levels of the corresponding gene product : @xmath24 for `` high '' , and @xmath40 for `` low '' .",
    "note that we distinguish between the arac protein that is unbound to arabinose ( which acts as a repressor ) and the arabinose - bound protein ( which acts as a promoter ) , with the parameter @xmath76 and the variable @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "for each of these variables , we propose a boolean function that represents how its state is influenced by the other variables and parameters .",

    "however , once the operon is in the on state , @xmath147 $ ] must be reduced to some lower threshold @xmath153 before @xmath149 can `` jump '' down to the off state .",
    "this means that if the arabinose concentration @xmath147 $ ] is in the range @xmath154 , then the operon can be observed as on in some cells and off in others .",
    "transcription of the _ arabad _ genes will likely not be initiated in cells that were raised in an arabinose - starved environment when @xmath147 $ ] gets increased to this middle range .",
    "in contrast , transcription will likely be observed in cells raised with arabinose , even as @xmath147 $ ] is decreased into this range .",
    "the s - shape of the curve in figure  [ fig : bistability ] is due to a third unstable steady state in the bistable region , which is denoted by the dashed line .",
    "the boolean analogue of this bistability is shown on the right in figure  [ fig : bistability ] .     in an ode model , as a function of concentration of extracellular arabinose .",
    "on the right is a boolean analogue of this .",
    "the dashed curve represents unstable steady states .",
    "bistability occurs when @xmath147\\in(\\tau^\\downarrow,\\tau^\\uparrow)$ ] because there are two stable steady states . ]    to see how our boolean network captures bistability , consider the initial condition whose parameter vector is @xmath155 and look at table  [ tbl : fixed - points ] .",
    "some cells , such as those raised in an arabinose - starved environment , end up in the off fixed point @xmath156 .",
    "now , consider increasing extracellular arabinose levels .",
    "when the concentration exceeds the `` up - threshold '' @xmath152 , then @xmath98 flips to @xmath24 in the parameter vector .",
    "this results in the system settling in a new on fixed point @xmath157 . on the other hand , cells raised in an arabinose - rich environment",
    "will be initially observed in the on fixed point @xmath158 .",
    "but if arabinose levels get too low , then @xmath114 in the parameter vector , and the system settles in a new off fixed point , @xmath156 .      at this point , we have verified that the fixed points of our boolean network model make sense biologically for all 12 choices of initial conditions .",
    "it remains to check that there are no other longer periodic cycles in the phase space .",
    "it would be nice to have algebraic methods to do this or a theorem with sufficient conditions for having only one basin of attraction . as far as we know ,",
    "neither of these exist , and so we need to resort to computer simulations . using the freely available online software _ analysis of dynamic algebraic models _",
    "( adam ) @xcite , we verified that indeed , for the @xmath0 initial conditions with only fixed points , there is only one basin of attraction consisting of all @xmath159 nodes .",
    "however , for the case where bistability is observed is more complicated .",
    "the phase space actually consists of six attractor basins : two with @xmath160 nodes each that lead into the fixed points , one with @xmath161 nodes that leads into a @xmath39-cycle , @xmath162 , and three with @xmath163 nodes each , that lead into the following @xmath3-cycles : @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166 this presents a problem because these longer periodic cycles do not make sense biologically .",
    "one explanation could be that that the model is faulty , in that either it does not represent the biology well , or perhaps the _ ara _ operon is simply ill - suited for a boolean network framework .",
    "another possibility could be that these periodic cycles are an artifact of using a synchronous update order . to test this",
    ", we used the _ gene interaction network simulation _ ( ginsim ) software @xcite to analyze the phase space under a general asynchronous update , which is more representative of an actual molecular network . under a general asynchronous update ,",
    "the periodic cycles merge and the only attractors in the phase space are the original two fixed points .",
    "this provides evidence that the longer periodic cycles are indeed artifacts of a synchronous update order and not a flaw in the model design .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a boolean network model of the _ ara _ operon in e.  coli on @xmath2 variables and @xmath3 parameters . unlike the _ lac _ operon which was modeled with a boolean network in @xcite , the _ ara _ operon uses dna looping to block transcription , it has a protein that acts as both a repressor and an activator , and glucose does not repress the transport of arabinose via inducer exclusion .",
    "we showed that under 11 of the 12 possible initial conditions , the system reaches a fixed point that agrees with the biology . in the last case , there were two fixed points ",
    "one for the operon being on and the other off .",
    "this captures the notion of bistability under medium levels of arabinose and no glucose .",
    "though there were other periodic cycles under an `` artificial '' synchronous update , these went away under a general asynchronous update order .",
    "the chance that this would happen in all of these cases by pure luck is astronomically small , which provides strong evidence for the strength and robustness of our model and the boolean network framework .",
    "our analysis used both computational algebra and software tools .",
    "we found the fixed points by writing the boolean functions as polynomials and then computing a grbner basis using sage .",
    "of course , this was not necessary because this network is small enough that we could have used boolean network software such as adam and/or ginsim to complete it . however , these methods are necessary for larger networks where the phase space is too big for boolean network software to handle .",
    "that said , one of the shortcomings is that not all of the model analysis can be done using computational algebra , and it would be desirable to further develop this theory .",
    "for example , is there a way to deduce that that a model has only one attractor basin , or only fixed points , just from the boolean functions ? there are some known results and theorems along these lines , but we were not able to find any the directly applied to our model .",
    "examples of such results include the following , mostly for general asynchronous update . in @xcite",
    ", robert showed that if the wiring diagram has no directed cycle , then @xmath167 has a unique fixed point .",
    "however , this does not eliminate the possibility of other periodic cycles or complex attractors .",
    "robert s result was generalized by shih and dong by restricting the directed cycles to certain subgraphs of the wiring diagram @xcite . in @xcite , richard gave a sufficient condition by proving a `` forbidden subnetworks theorem . '' by a theorem of richard @xcite , negative cycles are necessary for the existence of a cyclic attractor . since the _ ara _ operon has no negative cycles , the phase space can not contain periodic cycles .",
    "however , that does not necessarily forbid the existence of long complex attractors .",
    "another body of work involves the analysis and control of boolean networks using semi - tensor products @xcite , but it is not clear whether this work is directly applicable",
    ". future work on mathematical side includes either finding or developing theorems that would apply for this type of system .",
    "current and future work on the biological side consists of modeling not only other operons in the boolean network framework , but more complicated systems such as regulons and modulons . in some cases , if the biology is not completely understood , then algebraic reverse engineering techniques ( e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) can predict interactions are dependencies that have not been observed biologically .",
