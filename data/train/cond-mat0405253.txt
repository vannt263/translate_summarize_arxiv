    "<S> we give statistical definitions of the length , @xmath0 , of a loose prime knot tied into a long , fluctuating ring macromolecule . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo results for the equilibrium , good solvent regime show that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ring length and @xmath3 is independent of the knot type . in the collapsed regime below the theta temperature , length determinations based on the entropic competition of different knots within the same ring show knot delocalization ( @xmath4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> long polymers are remarkable systems in which topological entanglement is almost unavoidable  @xcite and shows consequences pertaining to many different scientific contexts . in chemistry </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis of macromolecules with nontrivial topology , like catenanes , is well established  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of knots and links in the biology of dna and the existence of enzymes like topoisomerases , which control these entanglements , have been at the basis of an explosion of interest in topology among biologists , chemists , mathematicians , and physicists since the eighties  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most recently , techniques for manipulating single molecules opened new possibilities of knot creation and study  @xcite .    in all these examples the knowledge of the degree of localization of the knots within the chains is of primary importance . </S>",
    "<S> the action of topoisomerases  @xcite certainly depends on how localized the topological entanglement is  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the folding dynamics of a knotted protein  @xcite should also be strongly influenced by the tightness of the knot . </S>",
    "<S> when a knot diffuses along a dna molecule stretched by molecular tweezers , the length of the entangled region is also essential since it determines the diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> if the knot is tight enough this length can be approximated by that of the knot in its ideal form  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal knot is realized with the shortest piece of rope of constant diameter and is the only one for which a precise definition of length exists  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this model is inadequate if the molecule is not well stretched and the knotted region fluctuates substantially .    in spite of several indications that prime knots of polymers in good solvent are rather well localized  @xcite , proofs and direct quantitative descriptions of this localization are still missing . </S>",
    "<S> this is primarily due to difficulties related to the notion of a knotted open string  @xcite . indeed , to localize the knot requires to identify an open portion of the ring which is  knotted \" . </S>",
    "<S> however , to assert that an open piece of a closed rope  contains \" a knot , is ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically there are no knots in an open string since continuous deformations can always bring it into an untangled shape . </S>",
    "<S> substantial progress in the description of localization properties of topological entanglement has been made for flat knots  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models describe three - dimensional knotted polymers fully adsorbed on a plane with the simplifying feature that the number of overlaps is restricted to the minimum compatible with the topology . in this way knot length </S>",
    "<S> can be defined and studied both numerically and analytically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was also discovered that flat knots become delocalized when the adsorbed polymer undergoes theta collapse  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a demonstration of the conjectured  @xcite analogous delocalization phenomenon for compact knotted polymers in three dimensions remains an open challenge  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose a statistical description of the lenght , @xmath0 , of a knot within a circular fluctuating polymers with @xmath2 monomers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath5 with @xmath3 in the good solvent regime ( weak localization ) , and @xmath6 ( delocalization ) in the collapsed phase  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider knotted self - avoiding polygons ( sap ) on cubic lattice , which are a good model for long polymers in a good solvent  @xcite . if necessary , a theta collapse  @xcite into compact configurations can be induced by switching on an attractive interaction between nearest neighbor lattice sites visited not consecutively by the sap  @xcite and by lowering enough the temperature @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the number of lattice edges occupied by the sap . </S>",
    "<S> a bfacf monte carlo dynamics  @xcite preserving the topology of the sap  @xcite enabled the sampling of equilibrium configurations of chains of variable @xmath2 . to increase mobility a multiple markov chains  @xcite in the space of the edge fugacity was implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> a first strategy of knot length determination is as follows . in each sampled configuration , various open portions of the sap </S>",
    "<S> are considered and for each one of them a closure is made by joining its ends , a and b , with an off - lattice path ( fig.1 ) .     once extracted the open string portion ( ab ) from the sap , we determine its center of mass c. an off - lattice planar 4-edges polygonal is attached to the extrema a and b. the polygonal lies on the plane cab . </S>",
    "<S> d , e and f are all chosen far away from c in order to avoid additional entanglement with the open string . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this path is chosen in order to minimize the risk of knot modifications or disentanglements in the resulting new ring . </S>",
    "<S> this risk can not be fully avoided and is a possible source of systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> once the new ring has been constructed , the computation of a topological invariant , namely the alexander polynomial  @xcite @xmath8 at @xmath9 , allows to verify the presence and the type of knot  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the length @xmath0 of the knot in a given sap configuration can then be identified with the shortest ring portion still displaying the original knot , among a large set obtained by several cutting and closing operations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the plot of the average length of a trefoil knot ( @xmath10 )  @xcite as a function of @xmath2 ( fig.2 ) shows full consistency with the scaling law @xmath11 with @xmath12 which is also robust with respect to a change of prime knot type . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we replace the @xmath10 by a @xmath13 or @xmath14 knot  @xcite , eq.(1 ) remains valid with the same @xmath15 within confidence limits . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , one can not estimate the possible systematic errors arising from the cutting and closing procedure used in this analysis  @xcite , which would be a serious handicap for applications to compact polymers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one needs to validate the law in eq.(1 ) by alternative , consistent methods of length determination .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 of the trefoil ( @xmath10 ) knot as a fuction of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the configurations sampled were @xmath17 in total . </S>",
    "<S> the brackets @xmath18 denote averages taken over data binned around fixed values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the log - log version of the plot . ]    </S>",
    "<S> consider a sap partitioned into two loops by a narrow slip link . </S>",
    "<S> each loop is tied into a @xmath10 knot and the monte carlo dynamics is such that each knot can not translocate from its loop to the other one ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two loops also remain unlinked .     </S>",
    "<S> sketch of a @xmath10 knot ( right ) forced to its typical length by the entropic competition between knotted loops . to simulate the slip link </S>",
    "<S> we impose the constraint that two fixed parallel edges of the polygon have always to be kept one lattice distance apart  @xcite . ]    since the number of configurations for the whole ring is maximum when one of the loops is much longer than the other one , most configurations break the symmetry between the two loops showing a marked length unbalance . </S>",
    "<S> typically , in one of the two loops the knot has a very large share of the whole ring at its disposal , while the other loop is just long enough to host its knot . </S>",
    "<S> consenquently , we choose to always identify the length of the shorter loop with the length , @xmath0 , of a trefoil knot inserted in a sap . </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath0 is always sampled now in situations in which the two ends of the knot come close to each other in the neighborhood of the slip link . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can hope this statistic to be representative of more general samples if laws like eq.(1 ) are considered . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for the average of this @xmath0 the power law behaviour reported in eq.(1 ) still holds , with @xmath19 , consistent with the previous estimate ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . in the case of two unknotted loops we verified that the average length of the shorter one does not grow appreciably with @xmath2 , further supporting our interpretation of @xmath0 as the knot length in the @xmath10 vs @xmath10 case .     </S>",
    "<S> log - log plot of the average value of the length @xmath0 of the shortest loop as a function of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> different curves correspond to the presence of different knots in the two loops . </S>",
    "<S> best fit estimates of @xmath15 are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ]    this last method of length determination needs a suitable competition between the two loops  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if only one of them were left unknotted , a too strong dominance of the knotted loop would result , making it almost impossible to sample configurations in which the longest loop is the unknotted one . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since the knot is rather localized , its freedom to place itself along the loop multiplies by a factor roughly proportional to the length of the loop itself the number of configurations accessible in its absence . by putting a @xmath13 knot against another @xmath13 knot </S>",
    "<S> , within error bars , we found the same value of @xmath15 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , like in the previous strategy , @xmath15 appears universal with respect to the prime knot type . </S>",
    "<S> we also carried out simulations in which one loop contained a trefoil , while the other one was tied into a composite knot made , e.g. , by the product @xmath28 of two trefoils  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the loop hosting the composite knot almost constantly dominates in length because both components are rather localized and free to move independently along it . in spite of the different conditions of entropic balance </S>",
    "<S> , we verified that also in this case the average length of the ( shorter ) loop with a single knot satisfies eq.(1 ) with the same @xmath29 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results have implications for the leading scaling correction to the singular behavior of quantities like the average radius of gyration of the sap , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> field theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) methods  @xcite and most monte carlo techniques  @xcite allow to determine exponents like @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ensembles in which configurations with all possible ring topologies are sampled . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is believed to remain the same in ensembles like those considered here , with fixed knot topology  @xcite . with our first cutting and closing method </S>",
    "<S> , we could check that the ring portion occupied by the knot has an average radius of gyration @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a length diverging as @xmath36 exists in addition to the leading one @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> standard scaling arguments then lead to expect a possible strong correction exponent @xmath38 for the ensemble with fixed knot topology </S>",
    "<S> . such stronger correction could be quite difficult to identify numerically at relatively short @xmath2  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our strategy based on entropic competition has the advantage of being applicable also to situations in which the polymer is compact . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since this method does not involve cutting and closing procedures , there is no risk that the knot topology gets altered , a highly probable event for compact configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this enabled us to address another key open issue in the field , namely the possible occurrence of knot delocalization in the compact regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we included nearest neighbor attractive interactions for the two loop model and simulated it extensively at @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the theta temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below the theta point it becomes more difficult to sample long sap configurations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at @xmath41 , as the critical edge fugacity is approached from below , the grand - canonical average number of sap edges , @xmath42 , undergoes a first order infinite jump from a finite value , rather than growing continuously to infinity as in the @xmath43 case . in spite of this difficulty </S>",
    "<S> , we could get rather clear evidence that the canonical average @xmath16 grows linearly with @xmath2 up to @xmath44 , implying @xmath6 , for the case of two competing @xmath10 knots ( fig . 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> like when dealing with the good solvent regime , in order to interpret the length of the shorter loop as the knot length , it is important to check what happens to the length of a loop without knot . </S>",
    "<S> we got evidence that in the compact regime an unknotted loop is also delocalized , i.e. shows an average length proportional to @xmath2 . however , the proportionality constant is about one order of magnitude smaller than that observed for the knotted loop in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . thus , knot delocalization seems to superimpose itself to a phenomenon of unknotted loop delocalization which is qualitatively similar , although quantitatively much less pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic competition between loops in the compact phase does not lead to a strong prominence of one of them on the other , like at high @xmath7 . to the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , all loop length ratios are realized with comparable probability . in this new scenario </S>",
    "<S> also the entropic mechanisms determining knot localization in the good solvent case cease to be active .    </S>",
    "<S> the delocalization of prime knots in compact polymer rings opens intriguing perspectives on how topological entanglement combines with more geometrical measures of complexity in polymers . </S>",
    "<S> one such measure for a fluctuating sap is the mean number of crossings , @xmath45 , one obtains by projecting on all possible planes a given configuration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity can be studied also for ideal knots  @xcite , and has been shown to be correlated with the mobility under electrophoresis of non - ideal knotted polymer rings with the same topology  @xcite . for ideal knots , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is expected to grow as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the length of the knot ( four third power law)@xcite . for fluctuating , nonideal polymers one can consider the average of @xmath45 over all configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that quite generally , for a compact sap , @xmath48  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result should indeed hold even for open walks and be independend of topology for knotted sap . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we find @xmath49 for a fluctuating , knotted compact sap suggests that for real knotted polymer rings a statistical generalization of the four third power law of ideal knots should hold : @xmath50 . in the case of ideal knots </S>",
    "<S> the growth of @xmath47 corresponds to an increase of the topological complexity of the knot considered  @xcite . for real knotted rings </S>",
    "<S> the topology remains fixed with increasing @xmath2 , while fluctuations are able to produce the same type of growth of @xmath16 versus @xmath51 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we gave a consistent and robust statistical description of the localization properties of prime knots in polymers . </S>",
    "<S> weak localization and delocalization hold in the good solvent and collapsed regimes , respectively .    </S>",
