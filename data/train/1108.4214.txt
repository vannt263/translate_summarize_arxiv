    "when performing molecular dynamics simulations , we distinguish between bonded and non - bonded interactions.@xcite effectively , this means that the interactions have been coarse - grained on the energy scale of the simulation .",
    "certain degrees of freedom are frozen , and we describe them as being permanent bonded .",
    "other degrees of freedom remain dynamic , and we describe them with relatively weak non - bonded interactions . however , this situation is less clear when simulating systems undergoing chemical reactions where bonds are created or broken .",
    "another example is dna molecules where hybridization bonds are broken at high temperatures and reformed when cooling the system . for such systems",
    ", it can be computationally more efficient to model these degrees of freedom as being dynamically bonded .",
    "the problem of bond dynamics is closely related to the question of how to represent chemical reactions in a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "reactive force fields such as reaxff and empirical valence bond ( evb ) can be used to model chemical reactions.@xcite bond order potentials are interesting since they allow three body interactions in the neighborhood of a bond to modify the strength of the bond.@xcite when coarse - graining systems capable of chemical reactions , it is important to note that the reaction radius and probability also has to be appropriately coarse - grained.@xcite when the bonds become dynamic , this also induces a dynamic for the angular and dihedral interactions . when breaking a bond , all angular and dihedral interactions involving that bond become invalid , and should be removed .",
    "similarly , when creating a bond , we have to identify which angular and dihedral interactions to create in the bond neighborhood .",
    "this ensures that after melting and renaturing of a system , it is again governed by the same set of interactions and return to the same equilibrium structure .",
    "dna molecules are comprised of the four bases adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) , guanine ( g ) , and thymine ( t ) .",
    "the bases are attached to a 2-deoxyribose sugar ring . for naturally occurring dna , sugar rings",
    "are linked to each other through phosphodiester bonds , that connect the 3 to 5 carbons in consecutive sugar rings .",
    "this builds a molecular directionality into the back bone of a dna strand , which will have a 3 and a 5 end .",
    "the strand is also characterized by a specific sequence of bases .",
    "together the phosphate backbone , the sugar and the base is denoted a nucleotide , which is the repeat unit of a single dna strand .",
    "a - t and c - g are watson - crick pairs and can form hydrogen bonds with each other .",
    "the energetically favorable stacking interactions allow two complementary single strands to form 3-5/ 5-3 anti - parallel aligned double strands .",
    "double stranded dna can be melted and renatured by repeated cycling the temperature around the melting point or by varying solvent conditions .",
    "dna is a very complex molecule and numerous models exists to describe behavior from atomistic properties to mesoscopic mechanical properties .",
    "the molecular structural details of short dna oligomers can be studied with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations such as amber@xcite and charmm@xcite . however , when we want to understand the large scale properties of dna molecules or materials in which dna molecules are a component , coarse - grained dna models are essential .",
    "coarse - graining is the statistical mechanical process by which uninteresting microscopic details are systematically removed , leaving a coarse - grained , effective model that is described by an effective free energy functional.@xcite a major advantage of coarse - grain models are that we can use them to simulate the interesting large scale dynamics of a system directly without wasting time on uninteresting details .",
    "this allows larger systems to be studied for longer times which paves the way for studying e.g. the properties materials rather than single molecules .",
    "a number of coarse - grain dna molecular dynamics models exists . in the `` three site per nucleotide '' model of de pablo and co - workers",
    ", a single nucleotide is represented by a phosphate backbone site , a sugar group site , and a base site , respectively@xcite .",
    "the model uses an implicit representation of counter ions at the level of debye - hckel theory , but has recently been generalized to explicit counter ions.@xcite a version of this model has also been generalized to include non - watson - crick base pairing such as hoogsteen pairing.@xcite there is also a number of `` two site per nucleotide '' models where one site represents the back bone and the sugar ring .",
    "the other site represents the base.@xcite one challenge to `` one site per nucleotide '' models are to represent the dna double helix .",
    "savelyev and papoian@xcite does this by special `` fan '' shaped pair - interactions between a bead and a large number of beads on the opposite strand .",
    "this model does not allow for dna melting .",
    "trovato and tozzini@xcite produce a helical structure using angular and dihedral interactions along the double strand . in the case where the large scale dna mechanical properties are of interest",
    ", it can be advantageous to coarse - grain a whole base - pair to a single rigid ellipsoidal or plate - shaped object and regard dna as a latter - like chain of such objects.@xcite here the coarse - graining has eliminated the melting and renaturation dynamics all together .",
    "other types of coarse - grain dna models are applied to study behavior of dna functionalized nano - particles .",
    "the dna molecules can e.g. be modeled as rigid rods with a single sticky site on one end and tethered to the surface of the nano - structure by the other end@xcite , as semi - flexible polymers with attractive sites on the monomers@xcite , or the whole dna molecule can be modeled as a single sticky site that can be hybridized to complementary free sticky sites.@xcite here the coarse - graining has completely eliminated the chemical structure , while the melting , renaturing , and sequence specificity has been retained in the dynamics .",
    "the two most prevalent statistical mechanical models of rna and dna melting are the poland - scheraga@xcite ( ps ) and the dauxois - peyrard - bishop@xcite ( dpb ) models .",
    "the poland - scheraga model describes dna as a 1d lattice model where a base - pair can either be hybridized or open .",
    "the free energy expression for the ps model contains empirical stacking free energies each stack of hybridized base - pairs as well as contributions from the strand configuration entropy due to internal bubbles , frayed ends and empirical initiation terms .",
    "the dpb model also describes dna as a 1d lattice model , but where each base - pair is characterized by a continuous base - pair distance .",
    "contrary to the ps model , the dpb model has a hamiltonian where the base - base potential is described by an anharmonic potential representing hydrogen bonding , and deviations between nearest neighbor base - pair extensions are penalized by a harmonic term .",
    "a generalization of the ps model exists , where the strand conformations are represented explicitly as lattice polymers .",
    "this provides a conceptual simplification since the conformational entropy of bubbles and frayed ends emerges naturally from the polymer model .",
    "this real space lattice ps model has been studied using exact enumeration techniques@xcite , a version of the model has also been applied to study rna folding using monte carlo simulations.@xcite    the dynamic bonding framework allows us to study classes of dna models where hybridization bonds , angular bonds , and dihedral bonds are created and broken dynamically .",
    "these dynamic bonding dna models are intermediates between the real space lattice ps models , the coarse - grained molecular dynamics models , and the sticky dna models described above . in the ps model ,",
    "base pairs can either be hybridized or open and are characterized by a corresponding free energy . in a dynamic bonding model , base pairs will be either hybridized or open and a free energy will also characterize this transition .",
    "in the coarse - grained molecular dynamics models and the dpb model , base pairs are represented by a continuous non - bonded pair - potential . in the dynamic bonding dna models ,",
    "base pairs are characterized by a continuous bond potential .",
    "the dynamic bond dna models can also be regarded as being off - lattice generalizations of the real space lattice ps model , where a single strand is described as a semi - flexible bead - spring polymer where complementary monomers will form hybridization bonds when they are close .",
    "the dynamic bonded dna models are `` one site per nucleotide '' models , but we can also lump sequence of nucleotides into a single coarse - grained bead . in this case , we can as a first approximation assume that only beads representing complementary sequences can hybridize , and that the breaking of a hybridization bond corresponds to the creation of a dna bubble .",
    "this would be a `` many nucleotides per site '' dynamic bonding dna model more akin to the sticky site dna models used to study dna functionalized nano - particles .",
    "the dynamic bonded dna models ensure anti - parallel strand alignment in the double strand state , through the interplay between the dihedral interactions and the directional bonds .",
    "such degrees of freedom are absent from both the ps and dpb 1d lattice models .",
    "the coarse - grained models use angular and dihedral interactions to ensure a structure resembling the real chemical structure of dna molecules . in dynamic bonded dna models ,",
    "the angular and dihedral interactions are dynamically introduced when hybridization bonds are formed to promote a zipper - like closing dynamic . similarly angular and dihedral interactions are dynamically removed as hybridization bonds are broken to promote zipper - like opening dynamic .",
    "hence in dynamic bond dna model , we utilize the interplay between dynamic bonded , angular , and dihedral interactions to model cooperative effects in the dna bubble and zippering dynamics , rather than to model chemical structure .",
    "the simplicity and success of the ps model in predicting sequence specific dna melting temperatures suggests that the essential physics of dna hybridization , melting and renaturing can , in fact , be accurately captured in a model without chemical details , and where the key property is the dynamics of hybridization .",
    "this is our motivation for developing the dynamic bonding framework .",
    "we will use it to develop and apply models to study the properties of hybrid materials containing both dna molecules and soft - condensed matter .",
    "we have implemented directional bonds and dynamic bonding in the large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator@xcite ( lammps ) .",
    "lammps is a versatile , parallel , highly optimized , open source code for performing molecular dynamics ( md ) and dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulations of coarse - grained models . due to the modular design",
    ", lammps is easy to extend with new interactions and functionality .",
    "the dynamic bonding implementation is also modular and easy to extend with new functionality .",
    "our extension is by no means limited to modeling dna , but could equally well be used for simulations of chemical reactions such as living polymerization , cross - linking of stiff polymers , coarse - grained dynamics of worm - like micelles and active driven materials .",
    "a snapshot of the lammps code with the directional bonds and dynamic bonding implementation can be obtained from the cpc program library .",
    "included with the code is also the documentation necessary for porting the directional and dynamic bonding framework to future lammps versions .",
    "[ sec : implementation1 ] is a summary of the implementation of directional bonds and the dynamic bonding framework .",
    "we present a simplified dna model based on the dynamic bonding framework in sect . [",
    "sec : dna - model ] , which is provides the examples of dna dynamics shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : illustrations ] .",
    "we conclude with our conclusions in sect . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] , and present the details of the directional bonds and dynamic bonding implementation in an appendix .",
    "double stranded dna only exists in a state where the two strands are aligned anti - parallel 3-5/5-3. in order distinguish between parallel and anti - parallel strand alignment , we regard the 3-5 back bone structure as a property of the back bone bonds , which become directional . this is necessary since the chemical structure of the nucleotides have been coarse - grained to a single structureless site .",
    "the directional bonds will also play a crucial role when introducing angular and dihedral interactions in a double stranded dna molecule , since this affects the stability , zippering dynamics , and mechanical properties .    to implement directional bonds in lammps ,",
    "we make use of the fact that newtons 3rd law is optional when calculating bond forces .",
    "when newtons 3rd law is enabled , each bond force is only calculated once , but subsequently has to be communicated to the bond partner . when it is disabled , lammps calculates the bond force twice , once for each of the two bond partners . in this case , each of the two bond partners store information about the bond type and the identity of the other bond partner .",
    "we can denote this situation by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which shows that the @xmath2 bead stores @xmath3 as the type of the bond to @xmath4 , and the @xmath4 bead stores @xmath3 as the type of the bond to @xmath2 . with a few modifications",
    ", lammps will load and store different bond types in the two bond partners .",
    "hence , we can have @xmath0 and @xmath5 , where the bond type @xmath6 from @xmath4 to @xmath2 and the bond type @xmath3 from @xmath2 to @xmath4 differs . when the two bond types refer to the same bond potential ,",
    "newtons 3rd law still applies , and the dynamics is unaffected .",
    "however , we can interpret the pattern of bond types as the directionality of the strand .",
    "note that if we instead use different bond potentials in the two directions or only a `` half '' bond , the result would be a net force along the bond , which can be used to model driven active matter .",
    "we shall not pursue this situation further in the present paper .",

    "these rules are applied to a specified group of reactive beads with a specified frequency .",
    "the application of the rules is conditional on the types of beads , types bonds , distance between beads and length of bonds involved .",
    "in particular , we have implemented rules for stochastic creation of symmetric and directional bonds within a certain reaction distance , stochastic removal of symmetric bonds larger than a breaking distance , removal of all symmetric bonds exceeding a certain length , and stochastic conversion of a symmetric bond from one type to another .",
    "furthermore , all bond creation rules ensure that a bead can never have more than a specified number of bonds of a given type .",
    "the implementation is structured such that it is easy to implement new types of rules .    besides the bond dynamics , the consistency of the angular and dihedral interactions should be ensured at all times .",
    "after bonds have been broken , all invalid potential angular and dihedral interactions involving broken bonds should also be removed .",
    "after bonds have been formed , all triplets or quartets of beads that could be connected by at least one new bond are checked to see if they require the creation of an angular or dihedral interaction .",
    "we discard cyclic triplets and quartets where the same bead appears more than once .",
    "an angular creation rule specifies which angular interaction can be introduced between a triplet of connected beads @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 .",
    "since the triplets are not ordered , the rule should match either @xmath8 or @xmath9 . to test",
    "if the @xmath8 bead order matches , we first compare the types of the @xmath8 beads with the bead types the rule specifies .",
    "we then compare the two bond types @xmath3 and @xmath6 with the bond types the rule specifies , where the bond types are defined directionally as @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "if the @xmath8 bead order did not match , it is repeated @xmath9 bead order , where the bonds types are defined directionally as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "if a rule match , then the specified angular interaction is introduced between the three beads .",
    "a creation rule for a dihedral interaction specifies four bead types and three bond types .",
    "again we test both @xmath13 and @xmath14 ordered bead quartets .",
    "first the bead types of the quartet are compared to the bead types specified by the rule , subsequently the bond types are compared , the bond types are defined directionally as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the bond types match if @xmath19 , @xmath6 or @xmath20 , and @xmath3 matches the three bond types specified by the rule . if the @xmath13 bead order did not match , it is repeated @xmath14 order .",
    "if a dihedral rule match a quartet of beads , the specified dihedral interaction is introduced between the four beads .",
    "these rules allows us to selectively and dynamically introduce angular and dihedral interactions taking both bead types and directional bond types into account .",
    "note that the same directionality applies to matching the bead type and bond type patterns .",
    "to have an efficient parallel implementation , we implement the bond creation and breaking by an pair matching algorithm inspired from the bond / break and bond / create fixes already implemented in lammps . in the dynamic bonding fix , preferred",
    "bond creation / breakage partners are identified in each simulation domain .",
    "this information is communicated between and aggregated across neighbor simulation domains .",
    "afterwards , the bonds selected for breakage are removed .",
    "the local neighborhood of all reactive beads are checked for angular and dihedral interactions , that should be removed because they cross broken bonds .",
    "then bonds are created between partners selected for bonding .",
    "again , we check the local neighborhood of all reactive beads to introduce angular and dihedral interactions . after this final step , we broadcast bond statistics to all simulation domains .",
    "note that due to the pair matching algorithm , each bead can maximally have one bond created and broken at each call to the dynamic bonding fix .",
    "all rules are applied to a bead pair ( in the specified order ) when identifying if they are eligible for matching .",
    "if multiple rules apply to the same bead pair , the last matching rule will be always be chosen . hence ,",
    "if this last rule has a very low reaction probability , it will completely shadow more probable rules specified earlier .",
    "these shadowing issues does not apply to the dna model below , and will not play a role at low concentrations of reacting beads .",

    "paircheck13 _ and _ paircheck14 _ switches includes 1 - 3 and 1 - 4 chemically distant beads in the search of potential bonding partners .",
    "the line is followed by a number of dynamic bonding rules .",
    "_ createbond _ rules specify pairs of bead types , that can be bonded , if they are within a certain maximum reaction distance from each other .",
    "if a bead has more than one potential bond partners , the closest partner is chosen , and a bond with the specified type is then created with the given probability . _",
    "createdirbond _ rules does the same as _ createbond _ , but creates a directional bond with the two specified bond types between the two bead types . _",
    "breakbond _ rules identifies bonded bead pairs with bonds longer than the specified minimum distance and breaks the bond with the specified probability .",
    "if a bead has more than one potential bond break partner , then the most distant partner is chosen . since",
    "only a single bond can be removed per bead per call to the dynamic bonding fix , a breakbond rule with unit probability does not ensure that all bonds longer than the minimum distance are broken .",
    "hence , we have also implemented _ killbond _ rules .",
    "these rules operate directly on the bond structures , and are not limited by the pair matching algorithm . _",
    "convertbond _ rules stochastically convert symmetric bonds of one type into another type .",
    "this is implemented as nominating the bond pair for removal of the old bond , followed by creation of the new bond .",
    "the dynamic bonding framework ensures that angular and dihedral interactions across the bond are also converted accordingly .",
    "_ createangle _ and _ createdihedral _ rules defines which angular and dihedral interaction types should be created between triplets and quartets of beads with the specified types of bead , and types of bonds between the beads as discussed above .",
    "_ createangle _ and _ createdihedral _ rules do not specify a probability , since they are created as required by the local neighborhood around new bonds .",
    "note that angular and dihedral interactions are only introduced as a consequence bond creation events , they are not introduced between already bonded beads even though the bead types and bond types match the rule . when checking potential beads for bond creation , all _ maxbond _ rules are checked to discard beads that already have the maximal number of the specified bond types .",

    "if a bond has been broken in its local neighborhood , the bead has to remove any angular and dihedral interactions involving that bond .",
    "this is done by generating all non - cyclic paths of length three and four either starting at or crossing the present bead using the outdated neighbor structure ( which still contains the broken bonds ) .",
    "the beads checks each path for bond breakage events ( using the bond interaction tables , which shows if a bond has been marked for breakage ) .",
    "if a path involves a broken bond , then the bead removes the corresponding entry in its angular and dihedral interaction tables , if they exist .",

    ".   bond creation .",
    "if two bonds nominate each other as bond creation partners , then an attempt is made at creating the bond .",
    "each bead contributes a uniform random number for bond creation , these are averaged and compared to the specified bond creation probability .",
    "again this ensures the same random choice for beads residing in different simulation domains .",
    "the new bond is added to the bond interaction table for the bead .",

    "each reactive bead is responsible for determining if a bond was created in their local neighborhood .",
    "this is done the same way as angular and dihedral interactions are removed .",
    "since the neighbor structure now contains the new bonds , we can generate non - cyclic paths of length three and four starting at or crossing the present bead using the updated neighbor structure ( which now contains the new bonds ) .",
    "each path is checked for bond creation events using the bond interaction tables .",
    "if the bead determines that it is part of a new triplet or quartet of beads , then it compares the bead types and directional bond types with all the angular and dihedral creation rules .",

    "distribution of statistics of the total number of bonds , angles , dihedrals introduced and removed in the current time step .",
    "since bond creation requires a distance check , the lammps pair communication distance should be at least the longest reaction distance , otherwise bonds will only be created between bead pairs within the communication distance from each other .",
    "since the implementation also depends on all beads knowing about all their bonded , angular , and dihedral interactions , it will not work without newtons 3rd law being disabled for bonded interactions .",
    "this is also required for the implementation of directional bonds .",
    "the dynamic bonding framework transparently handles symmetric bonds , hence they are just special cases of directional bonds .",
    "the dynamic bonding code is optimized to the situation , where the density of reacting beads is so low that at most one bond breakage and bond creation event is likely to occur per bead per time step .",
    "for instance , the match making algorithm does not attempt to make matches between rejected partners , that could still be eligible for bond breakage or bond creation rules . nor does the match making algorithm attempt to pick the most likely of multiple possible reaction path ways .",
    "for instance , if multiple bond creation rules applies to a single bead , then only the last nominated bond creation partner is stored .",
    "hence a creation rule with a low reaction probability can overwrite the bonding partner nominated by a prior creation rule with much higher reaction probability . in this case",
    ", the high probability reaction will never happen .",
    "similar issues apply when multiple bond break rules involve the same bead . since the bond conversion rules are implemented as bond deletion followed by bond creation",
    ", these can interfere with both bond creation and bond breakage rules .",
    "killbond rules are completely safe , since they are not implemented using the match making algorithm . for the dna model ,",
    "none of these caveats apply .",
