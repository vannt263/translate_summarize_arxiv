    "this family of orderings contains the dehornoy ordering , hence it is an extension of the dehornoy ordering .",
    "it is known that thurston type orderings have a property called the property @xmath9 , and consequently they define the well - ordering when they are restricted to the positive braid monoid @xmath8 .",
    "one of the problems of braid orderings is to determine the order type of the well - ordered set @xmath10 for a thurston type ordering @xmath11 , and to construct a method to compute ordinals for each element in @xmath8 . for the dehornoy ordering case",
    ", burckel solved these problems by using a correspondence between positive braid words and rooted labeled trees @xcite,@xcite .",
    "he introduced a normal form of a positive braid called _",

    "in @xcite , dehornoy gives alternative description of burckel s normal form by introducing the @xmath5-normal forms ( alternate normal form ) of positive braids .",
    "he utilized the alternate decomposition , which uses the garside structure of braid groups .",

    "the set of codes has two lexicographical orderings @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the @xmath4-normal form of a positive braid @xmath15 is defined as a positive word representative of @xmath15 whose code is maximal with respect to the ordering @xmath14 .",
