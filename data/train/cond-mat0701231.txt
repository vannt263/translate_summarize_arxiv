    "many real - life systems display both a high degree of local clustering and the small - world effect  @xcite .",
    "local clustering characterizes the tendency of groups of nodes to be all connected to each other , while the small - world effect describes the property that any two nodes in the system can be connected by relatively short paths .",
    "networks with these two characteristics are called small - world networks .    in the past few years , in order to describe real - life small - world networks , a number of models have been proposed .",
    "the first and the most widely - studied model is the simple and attractive small - world network model of watts and strogatz ( ws model )  @xcite , which triggered a sharp interest in the studies of the different properties of small - world networks such as the ws model or its variations .",
    "many authors tried to find more rigorous analytical results on the properties of either the ws model or on its variants that were easier to analyze or captured new aspects of small - worlds  @xcite .",
    "the ws model and its variants may provide valuable insight into some real - life networks showing how real - world systems are shaped .",
    "however , the small - world effect is much more general , it is still an active direction of research to explore other mechanisms producing small - world networks .    in real systems ,",
    "a series of microscopic events shape the network evolution , including addition or removal of a node and addition or removal of an edge  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the number of nodes in some real - life networks increases exponentially with time .",
    "the world wide web , for example , has been increasing in size exponentially from a few thousand nodes in the early 1990s to hundreds of millions today . to our knowledge",
    ", all previous models of small - world networks either are static ( not growing ) or have focused solely on addition of nodes and edges one by one .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to establish a exponentially growing network model and investigate the effect of more events , such as removal of edges , on the topological features .    in this paper",
    ", we present a simple geometric growth network model controlled by a tunable parameter @xmath0 , where existing edges can be removed . as in the ws model , by tuning parameter @xmath0 , the model undergoes a phase transition transition with increasing number of nodes from a `` large - world '' regime in which the average path length increases linearly with system size , to a `` small - world '' one in which it increases logarithmically .",
    "we study analytically and numerically the structural characteristics , all of which depend on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "our model is probable not as much a model of a real - world system as an example of vast variety of structure within the class of networks defined by a degree distribution , but it is the first growing model that exhibits the similar phenomena as the famous ws model .",
    "thus , it may be helpful for establishing more realistic growing small - world models of real - life systems in future .",
    "the network model is generated by decimating semi - ring , which is constructed in an iterative way as shown in fig .",
    "we denote our network after @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) time steps by @xmath3 .",
    "the network starts from an initial state ( @xmath4 ) of two nodes , which are distributed on both ends of a semi - ring and connected by one edge . for @xmath5",
    ", @xmath3 is obtained from @xmath6 as follows : for each existing internode interval along the semi - ring of @xmath6 , a new node is added and connected to its both end nodes ; at the same time , for each existing internode interval , with probability @xmath0 , we remove the edge linking its two end nodes , previously existing at step @xmath7 .",
    "the growth process is repeated until the network reaches the desired size .",
    ", showing the first four steps of the iterative process .",
    "the dashed lines denote the removed edges.,width=264 ]    when @xmath8 , the network is reduced to the one - dimension linear chains . for @xmath9 , no edge",
    "are deleted , and the network grows deterministically , which allows one exactly calculate its topological properties . as we will show below that in the special of @xmath9",
    "the network is small - world .",
    "thus , varying @xmath0 in the interval ( 0,1 ) , we can study the crossover between the one - dimension regular linear graph and the small - world network .",
    "now we compute the number of nodes and edges in @xmath3 .",
    "we denote the number of newly added nodes and edges at step @xmath1 by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "thus , initially ( @xmath4 ) , we have @xmath12 nodes and @xmath13 edges in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the total number of internode intervals along the semi - ring at step @xmath1 , then @xmath16 . by construction",
    ", we have @xmath17 for arbitrary @xmath18 .",
    "note that , when a new node is added to the network , an interval is destroyed and replaced by two new intervals , hence we have the following relation : @xmath19 .",
    "considering the initial value @xmath16 , we can easily get @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the addition of each new node leads to two new edges and one old edge removed with probability @xmath0 , which follows that @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the number of nodes @xmath22 and the total of edges @xmath23 in @xmath3 is @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the average node degree is then @xmath26 for large @xmath1 and any @xmath0 , it is small and approximately equal to @xmath27 .",
    "notice that many real - life networks are sparse in the sense that the number of edges in the network is much less than @xmath28 , the number of all possible edges  @xcite .",
    "below we will find that the tunable parameter @xmath0 controls all the relevant properties of the model , including degree distribution , clustering coefficient , and average path length .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath29 is defined as the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath30 edges . for @xmath8 ,",
    "all nodes , except the initial two nodes created at step 0 , have the same number of connections 2 , the network exhibits a completely homogeneous degree distribution .",
    "next we focus the case @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the degree of node @xmath33 at step @xmath1 . if node @xmath33 is added to the network at step @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , then , by construction , @xmath36 .",
    "in each of the subsequent time steps , there are two intervals with one at either side of @xmath33 .",
    "each of the two intervals will create a new node connected to @xmath33 , and each edge connecting the end nodes of the intervals could be considered to be deleted with probability @xmath0",
    ". then the degree @xmath37 of node @xmath33 satisfies the relation @xmath38 it should be mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ degee evolution ] ) does not hold true for the two initial nodes created at step 0 .",
    "but when the network becomes large , these few initial nodes have almost no effect on the structural characteristics .",
    "considering the initial condition @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ degee evolution ] ) becomes @xmath39 the degree of each node can be obtained explicitly as in eq .",
    "( [ ki ] ) , and we see that this degree increases at each iteration .",
    "so it is convenient to obtain the cumulative distribution  @xcite @xmath40 which is the probability that the degree is greater than or equal to @xmath30 .",
    "for some networks whose degree distributions have exponential tails : @xmath41 , cumulative distribution also has an exponential expression with the same exponent : @xmath42 this makes exponential distributions particularly easy to spot experimentally , by plotting the corresponding cumulative distributions on semilogarithmic scales .    using eq .",
    "( [ ki ] ) , we have @xmath43 .",
    "hence @xmath44 the cumulative distribution decays exponentially with @xmath30 .",
    "thus the resulting network is an exponential network .",
    "note that many small - world networks including the ws model belong to this class  @xcite .",

    "by definition , clustering coefficient  @xcite @xmath46 of a node @xmath33 is the ratio of the total number @xmath47 of edges that actually exist between all @xmath48 its nearest neighbors and the number @xmath49 of all possible edges between them , i.e. @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath51 of the whole network is the average of all individual @xmath52 .    for the case of @xmath8 ,",
    "the network is a one - dimensional chain , the clustering coefficient of an arbitrary node and their average value are both zero .    for the case of @xmath9 , using the connection rules , it is straightforward to calculate exactly the clustering coefficient of an arbitrary node and the average value for the network . when a new node @xmath33 joins the network , its degree @xmath48 and @xmath47 is @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively",
    "each subsequent addition of a link to that node increases both @xmath48 and @xmath47 by one .",
    "thus , @xmath47 equals to @xmath55 for all nodes at all steps .",
    "so one can see that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the degree of a node and its clustering . for a node @xmath56 of degree @xmath30 ,",
    "the exact expression for its clustering coefficient is @xmath57 , which has been also been obtained in other models  @xcite .",
    "this expression indicates that the local clustering scales as @xmath58 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a similar scaling has been observed empirically in several real - life networks  @xcite .",
