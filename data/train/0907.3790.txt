    "the inverse problem for chaotic one - dimensional maps has been recently proposed and solved in some cases by sogo @xcite .",
    "starting from a given invariant measure , the method allows to construct maps with that measure and lyapunov exponents in the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 this method can be used to construct exact examples of chaotic one - dimensional maps depending on the discrete parameter @xmath2 and having exactly known invariant measure and lyapunov exponent .",
    "the first goal of this work is to extend this method to families of maps that depend on a continuous parameter , display robust chaos i.e .",
    ", they have a chaotic attractor which is not destroyed by arbitrarily small changes of the parameter and have known invariant measure and lyapunov exponent .",
    "piecewise smooth maps may show robust chaos and have been used to describe robust chaos in circuits @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", many families of smooth maps have fragile chaos .",
    "for instance , the logistic map , @xmath3 , is chaotic for @xmath4 , but the attractor is periodic for a set of values of the parameter @xmath5 that is dense in the interval @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "if such a dynamical system describes a real device , it may be impossible to know in advance whether the behavior of the system will in fact be chaotic or periodic for some parameter value , which is always known with finite precision .",
    "however , robust chaotic behavior is required in many applications , including encrypting messages @xcite , random number generators @xcite and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "robust chaos also arises in neural networks @xcite as well as in the study of brain and population dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , simple and easy ways of constructing robust chaotic attractors with exactly known properties , as those explored in this work , can be of interest in different fields of science and engineering .",
    "andrecut and ali first found a smooth map @xcite and later a method of generating smooth maps @xcite whose evolution is chaotic for whole intervals of the parameter .",
    "another case is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we have recently explored several new ways to construct smooth one - dimensional maps with robust chaos @xcite .    the purpose of this work is to present other ways of constructing maps with robust chaos .",
    "the advantage of these new methods is that the lyapunov exponent is known exactly and the invariant measure is known always with the first , second and fourth methods and in many particular cases in the third approach .",

    "( [ eq : eqdifm ] ) we assumed that all terms in sum ( [ eq : fp ] ) had the same value .",
    "it is obvious that this simplifying condition can be relaxed in many ways .",
    "let us explore a simple one .",
    "one could construct a family of 2-to-1 maps , with the same prescribed invariant density @xmath63 but with a generalized relation between the terms in sum ( [ eq : fp ] ) , @xmath64 for instance . with this assumption",

    "( [ eq : eqdifm ] ) by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the value where the two preimages coincide : @xmath67 .",
    "the family @xmath10 would satisfy the following equation : @xmath68    for example , for any @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the solution of ( [ eq : eqdifmr ] ) with @xmath31 is @xmath72 with @xmath73 by using ( [ eq : eqdifmr ] ) and ( [ eq : alpharr ] ) the varying lyapunov exponent is readily computed : @xmath74 this value starts from @xmath75 , increases until its maximum @xmath76 and then decreases towards @xmath77 .",
    "the condition for the maximum at @xmath40 to be smooth is again @xmath78 .",
    "for example , if one selects for all @xmath44 the same constant invariant density @xmath79 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : solmu2 ] ) is the family @xmath80 with @xmath81 and the lyapunov exponent of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyap1b ] ) .",
    "@xmath82 is the full tent map @xmath39 .      if the starting point is the invariant density of the full logistic map , @xmath83^{-1/2}$ ] , we get , for every @xmath44 , @xmath84 with @xmath85 and the lyapunov exponent ( [ eq : lyap1b ] ) .",
    "the full logistic map is recovered with @xmath4 : @xmath48 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the method in this section for @xmath86",

( [ eq : eqdifm ] ) it was assumed that @xmath2 is an integer larger than one . but let us substitute for it a real number @xmath53 : @xmath87 notice that we are using again the same invariant density @xmath63 for all values of the continuous parameter @xmath5 , which now replaces the constant multiplicity @xmath2 . if we get a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqdifr ] ) for a given @xmath63 , the latter will not satisfy the frobenius - perron equation for non - integer values of @xmath5 , but this does not prevent the solution @xmath10 from being chaotic for all @xmath53 , as we will show in the following .",
    "in fact , by using an argument very similar to the one leading to ( [ eq : lambdam ] ) , one can show that the lyapunov exponent of the family satisfying ( [ eq : eqdifr ] ) will be @xmath88 , for all @xmath53 .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fam3 ] ) for @xmath33 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",

    "( [ eq : eqdifr ] ) for all @xmath53 is @xmath94 for @xmath95 the maps @xmath54 reduce to polynomials and we recover the ` chebyshev hierarchy ' of refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind .",
    "all these maps are chaotic , with lyapunov exponent @xmath98 and the same invariant invariant density as the full logistic map @xmath99 .",
    "the question is what happens for non - integer values of @xmath5 ?",
    "their lyapunov exponent is @xmath88 and we can see in the bifurcation diagram of fig .  [ fig3 ] that the attractor only fills the phase space @xmath8 $ ] for @xmath100 .",
    "but , what about the invariant measure ?",
    "the point is that now all points @xmath101 do not have the same number @xmath2 of preimages @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 , as assumed in refs . @xcite and sect .",
    "[ sec : robust ] and [ sec : constant ] . in consequence",
    ", the starting invariant density will not satisfy the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) for non - integer values of @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , the actual invariant measure will satisfy that equation with a value of @xmath2 depending on the point @xmath101 .",
    "it it clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which display in solid line the graphs of two members of family ( [ eq : fam3 ] ) , that the value @xmath102 will change in this example at point @xmath103 and the same will happen at all its images , so that we can expect the invariant measure to be discontinuous at every point in the orbit of @xmath104 : @xmath105 0    ) and ( [ eq : saw ] ) for @xmath106.[fig4 ] ]    the task of finding the invariant measure can thus be very difficult unless the orbit @xmath107 is simple enough ( a cycle ) , as happens in the ` chebyshev hierarchy ' ( where @xmath95 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 , so that the invariant density is continuous for @xmath26 ) , but also for many non - integer values of @xmath5 as we shall see now .",
    "for instance , in the left graph of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the parameter equals the golden ratio , @xmath110 , and then the orbit of @xmath111 is a 3-cycle : @xmath112 since one can multiply a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) and ( [ eq : eqdifr ] ) with any constant , one may suspect that the actual invariant measure of the maps ( [ eq : fam3 ] ) is that of the full logistic map multiplied by a function which is constant except at the points lying on the orbit of @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , we can find the exact expression of the invariant density for @xmath113 by using the normalization condition @xmath114 and trying in the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) a density in the form @xmath115 with constant @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 and the following multiplicity : @xmath119 one finally finds @xmath120 the result can be easily checked by means of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "even simpler is the orbit of @xmath104 for @xmath121 : @xmath122 from this 2-cycle and the frobenius - perron equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) it is easy to find the invariant density : @xmath123    other cases with piecewise continuous invariant measure can be found in a similar way",
    ".    it should be noticed that maps ( [ eq : fam3 ] ) are a nice example of solvable robust chaos , since the solution can be explicitly written in terms of the initial condition @xmath124 as @xmath125 .",
    "another way to construct examples of robust chaos takes advantage of the invariance of lyapunov exponents through diffeomorphisms on the interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we are going to consider three different approaches .",
    "if we know a family of chaotic maps @xmath54 with invariant densities @xmath126 and choose a diffeomorphism @xmath127 , the topologically conjugated family @xmath128 will have the same lyapunov exponent and the following invariant density @xcite : @xmath129    for example if @xmath10 is the family ( [ eq : fam1b ] ) and the diffeomorphism @xmath130 the topologically conjugated family is ( [ eq : fam1c ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath10 is the family ( [ eq : fam3 ] ) and the diffeomorphism @xmath131 the topologically conjugated family is @xmath132 maps ( [ eq : saw ] ) are piecewise linear and two particular cases are depicted in dashed line in fig .",
    "moreover , one recovers the full tent map for @xmath133 .",
    "it is obvious that since the slope of the graph of @xmath134 is nearly everywhere @xmath135 the maps are chaotic for all @xmath53 and that the lyapunov exponent is @xmath88 .",
    "this in turn proves again that the topologically conjugated family ( [ eq : fam2 ] ) is chaotic and has the same lyapunov coefficient .",
    "the invariant density is @xmath136 for @xmath137 and can be computed for other values of @xmath5 by using ( [ eq : rhoconj ] ) or the method discussed in the last section . for example",
    ", the measure corresponding to ( [ eq : sqrt2 ] ) is piecewise constant : @xmath138      a second possibility is to choose a single chaotic map @xmath139 with known invariant density @xmath63 and lyapunov exponent @xmath140 and a family of diffeomorphisms depending on a continuous parameter : @xmath141 .",
    "then the maps @xmath142 will have the same lyapunov exponent and the following natural density : @xmath143    for instance , if the starting map is the full tent map , @xmath144 , with @xmath145 and @xmath146 and the diffeomorphism @xmath147 , with @xmath44 , the family @xmath148 is precisely ( [ eq : fam1a ] ) with the same lyapunov exponent and the invariant density ( [ eq : rhopot ] ) .",
    "( notice that in this example @xmath149 . )    on the other hand , given the full tent map and the diffeomorphisms @xmath150 , with @xmath44 , the topologically conjugated smooth maps @xmath151 have the same lyapunov exponent and the natural densities @xmath152 this map , which is also obtained from the full logistic map @xmath153 by means of the diffeomorphism @xmath154 , is a simple example of exactly solvable robust chaos , in which everything is known , including the general solution @xmath155 .",
    "we recover the full logistic map with @xmath156 .",
    "finally , one can choose a chaotic map @xmath139 with known invariant density @xmath63 and lyapunov exponent @xmath140 and a prescribed family of natural densities @xmath157 depending on the parameter @xmath5 . then each family of diffeomorphisms @xmath158 satisfying the differential equation @xmath159 will provide a family of maps @xmath142 with the same lyapunov exponent and the desired natural measure .",
    "if we want @xmath141 to be increasing , the solution of ( [ eq : eqdiftil ] ) is @xmath160 with @xmath161    for example if @xmath139 is the full tent map and @xmath162 , the solution ( [ eq : solphimu ] ) us @xmath147 for @xmath44 , and we recover once more the family ( [ eq : fam1a ] ) , which in turn shows again that the latter is chaotic for all positive real values of @xmath5 and that its invariant density is ( [ eq : rhopot ] ) .    if we choose @xmath141 to be decreasing , the solution of ( [ eq : eqdiftil ] ) is @xmath163 and for @xmath162 and @xmath44 we have @xmath164 , which transforms the full tent map into the family ( [ eq : fam1 ] ) .",
    "since families ( [ eq : fam1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fam1a ] ) are topologically conjugated to the full tent map , they are also conjugated to each other . in fact",
    ", the diffeomorphism conjugating them is @xmath165 .",
    "this a nice example of two topologically conjugated maps sharing not only the lyapunov exponent but also the natural invariant measure .",
    "this simple example shows that the maps found in previous sections are not necessarily the only solution to the corresponding problem .",
    "it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that in general the inverse problem does not have a unique solution and several examples were described with different maps sharing a given invariant density while having different lyapunov exponents in the form @xmath166 .",
    "we see here that it is also possible to have different maps with the same lyapunov exponent and invariant measure .",
    "an obvious variant of the method in this section is a starting family of densities @xmath126 depending on the parameter @xmath5 to construct a family of chaotic maps with a constant density @xmath167 by solving @xmath168",
    "obviously , one can combine the methods in the previous sections to get families of maps depending on several parameters which display robust chaos . instead",
    ", we will discuss a more general and easier method to accomplish the same .",
    "all the maps considered before can be written in the form @xmath169 , for some appropriate @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "in fact , for the particular case of smooth unimodal families with robust chaos it has been proven that all maps within the family are topologically conjugate @xcite .",
    "this suggests a general way to construct a map @xmath172 ( smooth or not , unimodal or not ) with prescribed lyapunov exponent @xmath140 and natural invariant density @xmath63 , such that @xmath92 is a diffeomorphism , even in the case in which @xmath172 , @xmath140 and @xmath173 depend on one or several parameters , which will not be written explicitly .",
    "the starting point is a set of @xmath2 values @xmath174 such that @xmath175 if @xmath176 and @xmath177 , for @xmath178 , the piecewise linear map @xmath179 ( with @xmath180 ) has the invariant density @xmath181 , because of ( [ eq : suma ] ) , and the lyapunov exponent @xmath182 the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath183 is obtained with @xmath184 .",
    "now , if one chooses a value of @xmath2 large enough ( so that @xmath185 ) and a set of values @xmath186 ( depending on the parameters of the desired map ) such that @xmath187 , then the map @xmath169 will have the prescribed lyapunov exponent @xmath140 and natural invariant density @xmath188 .",
    "the derivative @xmath189 will be continuous at the maxima ( minima ) if @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the map @xmath172 will not be unique , since many others can be constructed in the same way with higher values of @xmath2 and , even for the same @xmath2 , there will be in general many ( infinite ) ways of choosing the values @xmath186 .",
    "for instance , this method reduces to ( [ eq : solmu1b ] ) for @xmath23 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "on the other hand , solution ( [ eq : solmu2 ] ) is recovered with @xmath23 , @xmath194 and @xmath170 given by ( [ eq : fam1b ] ) .",
    "it is also easy to change slightly this method to construct maps with known lyapunov exponent and piecewise natural density .",
    "let us consider a single case . instead of ( [ eq : mapg ] )",
    "the starting point will be @xmath195 for @xmath196 since the orbit of @xmath197 is @xmath198 there will be a single discontinuity point in the natural invariant density , which in fact is @xmath199 while the lyapunov exponent is @xmath200 the maximum value is reached with @xmath201 . then for each choice of the values @xmath186 , the map @xmath202 will have the lyapunov exponent @xmath203 and the natural invariant density @xmath204 for instance , taking @xmath205 and @xmath206 , one recovers the map ( [ eq : saw ] ) for @xmath207 , which can be extended to a piecewise linear family with known lyapunov exponent and invariant measure by letting @xmath208 run from @xmath209 to @xmath210 . in turn",
    ", applying to that family the diffeomorphism @xmath211 one gets a family of smooth maps with known lyapunov exponent and piecewise continuous natural invariant density , which coincides with ( [ eq : fam3 ] ) when @xmath212 .",

    "we have presented some new easy methods to construct families of one - dimensional maps with robust chaos and exactly known lyapunov exponent and natural invariant measure . as far as we know , this is the first time general methods to do that are discussed .    it should be stressed that the explicit examples with robust chaos discussed above have been selected for simplicity , but many other can be easily constructed with the ideas discussed in this work .",
