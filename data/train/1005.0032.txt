    "in recent years , new insights into the most extreme environments in the galaxy have been obtained through the very high energy  ( vhe , @xmath4100 gev )  gamma - ray band  @xcite .",
    "the majority of the @xmath450 galactic tev sources found thus far are associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) or pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "the detection of these stellar remnants in vhe gamma rays constitutes a probe of non - thermal astrophysical processes .",
    "the acceleration of electrons or nuclei , above 1 tev , in these sources leads to the generation of gamma rays .",
    "relativistic electrons can produce gamma rays by non - thermal bremsstrahlung , and by inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering on ambient microwave , ir , or optical photons , whereas protons and atomic nuclei can generate gamma rays via the decay of neutral pions produced in hadronic interactions with ambient material .",
    "a confirmation of the latter process associated with the gamma rays from snrs is seen as a probe of nucleonic cosmic ray production sites in the galaxy .",
    "the snr g54.1 + 0.3 has been predicted to emit gamma rays detectable with the current generation of tev instruments after the discovery of a rotation - powered pulsar in its centre , a source of high energy electrons  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this pulsar , psr j1930 + 1852  ( p=136 ms ) , with a derived spindown power of @xmath5 = 1.2@xmath6 erg / s and a spindown age of @xmath7@xmath12900 years  @xcite , is among the youngest and most energetic pulsars known .",
    "the pwn powered by this pulsar was first recognized as such from high resolution radio observations  @xcite .",
    "the pwn exhibits a filled - center morphology  ( @xmath8 ) , a flat radio spectrum  ( @xmath9 ) which is fairly constant over the entire source extent , and a high level of polarization  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of an x - ray jet ,  consistent with the radio extension ,  and the measurement of its non - thermal spectrum confirmed the pwn nature of g54.1 + 0.3  @xcite .",
    "more detailed x - ray observations by  @xcite resolved the inner structure of the nebula as a central point - like source with a surrounding ring and bipolar elongations , comparable to the crab nebula .  the same authors suggested a distance of @xmath15 kpc , based on the x - ray absorption .  the most recent estimate is 6.2@xmath10 kpc , based on an apparent morphological association between the pwn and a nearby molecular co cloud  @xcite .",
    "similar to the crab nebula , g54.1 + 0.3 lacks a strong surrounding circumstellar interaction between the snr forward shock and the progenitor star wind  @xcite , in which particles could be accelerated and produce an additional non - thermal emission contribution .",
    "recently , @xcite found a shell of 30 diameter surrounding g54.1 + 0.3 , but the authors concluded that these are unlikely to be associated based on the different measured distances .",
    "after that ,  @xcite identified a partial shell - like infrared structure surrounding much of the x - ray / radio core in g54.1 + 0.3 , which they proposed to be a star - forming region triggered by late - phase winds from the snr progenitor star .",
    "based on high - resolution ir spectra , however ,  @xcite suggested that the shell is composed of freshly - formed ejecta dust that appears to be heated by the expanding pwn .",
    "g54.1 + 0.3 has not been previously detected at @xmath11-ray energies .",
    "the source lies 1.4@xmath12 from the egret source 3eg j1928 + 1733  @xcite .",
    "this is slightly outside the 99% confidence - level error box .",
    "the older  ( @xmath13@xmath18.2@xmath14 years )  and less - energetic ( @xmath5 = 1.6@xmath15 ergs / s ) pulsar psr j1928 + 1746 is proposed as a more likely counterpart to the unidentified 3eg source  @xcite .",
    "this is strengthened with the much better localization of the gamma - ray source 1fgl j1929.0 + 1741c ,  associated with 3eg j1928 + 1733 in the first fermi catalogue  @xcite .",
    "this other pulsar is 1.2@xmath12 away from psr j1930 + 1852 .  in the vhe @xmath11-ray domain ,",
    "the only published observation is an upper limit from the hegra collaboration at @xmath16 of the crab nebula flux above 600 gev  @xcite .  in this letter",
    "we report the discovery by veritas of vhe gamma - ray emission from the direction of the very young system g54.1 + 0.3/psr j1930 + 1852 .",
    "the instrument and observations are described in   2 ,  while the analysis performed on these data is detailed in   3 .",
    "results are presented in   4 and interpretation and conclusion in   5 .",
    "veritas is an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona , usa @xcite .",
    "each telescope has a mirror area of 110 m@xmath17 and is equipped with a 499-pixel camera of 3.5@xmath12 diameter field - of- view .",
    "the system , completed in the fall of 2007 ,  is run in a coincident mode requiring at least two of the four telescopes to trigger in each event .",
    "this design allows for the observations of astrophysical objects in the energy range from 100 gev to above 30 tev .",
    "veritas has an angular resolution ( 68% containment ) of 0.1@xmath12 diameter per event and a 5@xmath0 point source sensitivity of 1% of the steady crab nebula flux above 300 gev in less than 50 hours of observation at a 20@xmath12 zenith angle .",
    "the first pointed observations of the g54.1 + 0.3/psr j1930 + 1852 system with veritas took place during a survey of northern - hemisphere galactic pulsars between september 2007 and october 2008 .",
    "the live time of this first data set , after data - quality selection based on weather and hardware status , amounts to 14.5 hr ( some of which was taken in partial moonlight ) .",
    "analysis of these data revealed evidence of a vhe @xmath11-ray signal at the position of psr j1930 + 1852 at the 4@xmath0 level after accounting for all analysis trials .",
    "this evidence triggered further observations between april 2009 and june 2009 , resulting in 22.2 additional hours after quality selection .",
    "of these , the most recent 15.2 hours of data were taken using only three telescopes , as telescope t1 was in the process of being relocated to optimize the instrument sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "the zenith angle range of observation of the combined data sets is 13@xmath12 to 35@xmath12 , and the total live time is 36.6 hr .",
    "cccccccc[t ] j1930 + 1852 & 0.5 & 231 & 720 & 0.18 & 101 & 7.0@xmath0 & 5.3 @xmath18 1.3 + j1928 + 1746 & 0.7 to 1.7 & 108 & 509 & 0.19 & 13 & 1.2 @xmath0 & @xmath19 +",
    "after calibration , the standard veritas event reconstruction scheme is applied to the data : tail - cuts image - cleaning , second - moment parameterization of these images  @xcite and stereoscopic direction determination based on the intersection of image axes ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "an initial selection of the events is performed to reject those in which the primary parameters , energy and direction , can not be well - reconstructed .",
    "the events surviving this quality selection are those for which at least two telescope images have more than 4 pixels included in the image with a total integrated charge in each image of more than 80 photoelectrons , and with less than 20% of the total charge in the outermost ring of camera pixels .",
    "this selection removes images with insufficient cherenkov light for accurate parameterization , or which are truncated by the camera boundary .",
    "in addition , events for which only the telescopes t1 and t4 have surviving images are excluded , as their separation of only 35 m introduces an irreducible high background rate , due to local muons , degrading the instrument sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "a further selection of events is performed to suppress the otherwise overwhelming hadronic cosmic - ray background .",
    "this is achieved by comparing the shapes of the event images in each telescope with the expected shapes of simulated gamma - ray showers .",
    "these _ mean - reduced - scaled width _ ( mrsw ) and _ mean - reduced - scaled length _ ( mrsl ) cuts ( see definition in @xcite ) , as well as an additional cut on the arrival direction of the incoming gamma - ray with respect to the source position  ( @xmath20 ) reject more than 99.9% of the hadronic cosmic - ray background while keeping 45% of the gamma - rays .",
    "different sets of these cuts , optimized for different source properties , are applied to the g54.1 + 0.3 data .",
    "two _ a priori _ test positions are defined as the locations of the high spindown power pulsars : j1930 + 1852 ( @xmath21 ) and j1928 + 1746 ( @xmath22 ) .  in the search for a vhe @xmath11-ray signal from a point source with a crab - like spectrum",
    "the following cuts were employed : -1.2 @xmath23 mscw / l @xmath23 0.5 and @xmath24 deg@xmath17 , resulting in an analysis threshold of 250 gev .  since the emission region may be extended , as is the case of most of the galactic pwn detected at vhe @xmath11-rays  @xcite , a larger cut in the arrival direction @xmath25 deg@xmath17 is also considered .",
    "in addition , a rather tight cut on the integrated charge of @xmath1225 photoelectrons is applied , to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio for a weak source with a hard spectrum .  the latter cut results in an analysis threshold of 500 gev and in superior angular resolution .",
    "for the spectral analysis , this cut is 80 photoelectrons providing maximal coverage in energy .",
    "smoothed excess map from g54.1 + 0.3 , as measured by veritas .",
    "only events with image sizes above 225 photoelectrons are used .",
    "the color scale indicates the number of excess gamma - ray events .",
    "the high @xmath5 pulsars present in this field - of - view , j1930 + 1852 and j1928 + 1746 , are marked with white plus signs .",
    "the contour of the 99% confidence level error box of the unidentified egret source 3eg j1928 + 1746 is overlaid in black .",
    "the gamma - ray sources in the first fermi catalogue are marked with black crosses  [ fig1].,width=313 ]    for the background estimation , we employ two different methods , as described in  @xcite .  the background estimate for each position in the two - dimensional sky map is taken from a ring of mean radius 0.5@xmath12 and an area six times that of the on - source region .",
    "for the spectral analysis , the background is taken from 7 positions in the field - of - view with the same offset from the pointing direction as the source regions .",
    "this eliminates the need for corrections concerning the radial dependence of the background acceptance .",
    "the on - source and background region counts , together with a normalization factor for the different acceptance of these regions , are used to derive the statistical significance of any excess following the likelihood method of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a sky map of the excess counts for the entire data set in the region around g54.1 + 0.3/psr j1930 + 1852 system , derived using the point source analysis described above .  a source of vhe gamma rays is clearly visible and is coincident with the position of the x - ray and radio pwn .",
    "an excess of 101 events is observed , corresponding to a pre - trials statistical significance of 7.0@xmath0 at the location of psr j1930 + 1852 , as shown in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "this significance is the highest obtained at the pulsar position for the four different search criteria attempted , and this is taken into account in assessing the true chance probability of the observed signal of 6.8@xmath0 .  as discussed above , the earlier data set showed evidence for a vhe @xmath11-ray signal at 4.3@xmath0 .",
    "this evidence is confirmed by the presence of a 5.5@xmath0 detection at the same position in 2009 data set alone .",
    "this increase is as expected for a steady source with increased exposure time and a slightly reduced sensitivity of the array with only three telescopes .",
    "the unsmoothed map of excess events , binned in 0.05@xmath260.05@xmath12 , is fit by a two - dimensional gaussian in order to study the morphology of the observed emission .",
    "the gamma - ray excess is well fit by the point - spread function of the instrument at the corresponding analysis threshold of 500 gev ( @xmath10.11@xmath12 ) , which results in a detection compatible with a point - like source for veritas .",
    "the best fit of the gaussian centroid is @xmath27 ( j2000 ) and hence we assign the name ver j1930 + 188 .  given the systematic uncertainty of 0.02@xmath12 in this measurement , the centroid is consistent with the pulsar position ( at a distance of 0.007@xmath12 ) and the 0.03@xmath12 extent of the pwn g54.1 + 0.3 around the pulsar .",
    "the total @xmath11-ray excess above 250 gev , i.e. that within a circle of 0.15@xmath12 around the pulsar position , is 214@xmath1843 events .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the reconstructed gamma - ray spectrum from these events .",
    "the data are consistent with a power law in energy that extends from 250 gev up to 4 tev with a photon index of @xmath28 and a differential flux at 1 tev of @xmath29 tev@xmath30 @xmath31 s@xmath30 .  the corresponding flux above 1 tev is @xmath32 of the crab nebula flux .",
    "no other significant tev source is found in the maps , including at the second _ a priori _ test position , the location of psr j1928 + 1746 , for any of the searches performed .",
    "the significance at this pulsar position is 1.2@xmath0 and the flux upper limit above 1 tev at the 99% confidence level  @xcite assuming a power law source spectrum with @xmath33 is f @xmath23",
    "@xmath34 @xmath31 s@xmath30 ( about 1.4% of the flux of the crab nebula ; see table  [ table2 ] ) .",

    "veritas has detected vhe gamma - ray emission from the direction of the snr g54.1 + 0.3 , providing a new input to study the non - thermal particle population in this object .",
    "this new tev source , ver j1930 + 188 ,  appears point - like within the instrument resolution and does not show a notable offset from the pulsar psr j1930 + 1852 , placing it among the more compact tev sources found to be associated with an snr .",
    "the emission is co - located with the x - ray and radio pwn in the snr g54.1 + 0.3 ,  and also with a molecular co cloud in apparent morphological association with the pwn and a partial shell of ir ejecta around the pwn .",
    "assuming the gamma - ray production in ver j1930 + 188 is related to the pulsar , the compactness of the tev source and lack of significant offset between the pulsar and its x - ray pwn and the tev source can be attributed to its relative youth .",
    "the spin - down age of psr j1930 + 1852 is 2900 years , which places it as the latest addition to an emergent class of tev sources associated with very young pulsars : psr b0531 + 21/crab nebula  @xcite , psr j1747 - 2809/hess j1747 - 281 in g0.9 + 0.1  @xcite , psr j1845 - 0258/hess j1845 - 029 in snr kes 75 , psr j1833 - 1036/hess j1833 - 105 in g21.5 - 0.9  @xcite and psr j1813 - 1749/hess j1813 - 178 in g12.82 - 0.02  @xcite .",
    "those pwne are good candidates for being in the early stage of evolution , where the wind nebula is interacting with the freely - expanding supernova ejecta .",
    "this population stands in contrast to an apparently more common variety of energetic - pulsar - associated tev sources , a group which contains , as notable examples , psr b1823 - 1313/hess j1825 - 137  @xcite ,  psr b0833 - 45/vela x  @xcite and psr j2229 + 6114/ver j2227 + 608  @xcite .",
    "these objects show extended tev emission which is both larger than the x - ray pwn and offset from the pulsar location  ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "a common element in this class is older , middle - aged pulsars , with ages @xmath410@xmath35 yr .  here",
    "the pwn may be displaced in some direction , possibly by an asymmetric snr reverse shock generated from an explosion into an inhomogeneous medium  @xcite .",
    "table 2 lists the pulsar properties ( spin - down power , age and distance ) and the nebular energetics in several compact pwne detected in tev .  the total power , l@xmath36 , radiated by g54.1 + 0.3 in the energy band 0.2 - 10 tev is @xmath37 erg s@xmath30 compared to @xmath38 erg s@xmath30 for the crab nebula .",
    "this value of the gamma - ray luminosity of g54.1 + 0.3 is the same order of magnitude what has been found for the other pwne in the table .",
    "a more relevant quantity to compare is the efficiency of tev luminosity production compared to the pulsar power which is @xmath390.17% for g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "this is similar to that of g0.9 + 0.1  ( @xmath40  0.1% ) and 10 times larger than other young systems like the crab nebula  ( @xmath40  0.02% ) and hess g21.5 - 0.9  ( @xmath40  0.02% ) .",
    "however , all these pwne have significantly lower levels  ( ranging from 0.1 to 2.9% ) of x - ray luminosity production efficiency than the crab nebula ( @xmath40  4% ) .  despite being worst synchrotron emitters than the crab nebula , g54.1 + 0.3 together with the other recent compact tev pwne , are similar and even better tev emitters than the crab nebula .",
    "another diagnostic is the strength of the synchrotron emission relative to the gamma - ray emission , l@xmath41/l@xmath42 .",
    "the crab nebula has the largest ratio among all young systems by far with l@xmath43/l@xmath42 of 220 .",
    "that of g54.1 + 0.3 is the lowest among the others that range between 1.4 and 30 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with  @xcite who finds l@xmath42@xmath4l@xmath43 after 5 kyr from pulsar birth ,  including a different list of objects and spanning over a larger range of @xmath7 .",
    "the scattering of this ratio in two orders of magnitude , may be attributed to the unique environments in each of these objects , such as the local ambient photon fields or the interactions with the surrounding mediums resulting in an increase of the nebular magnetic field .  as suggested by  @xcite",
    ", these pwne may not be in energy equipartition between particles and magnetic fields , as is the case for the crab nebula .  instead , these may be particle - dominated objects .",
    "however , proper modeling of each of these pwne and its surroundings is needed to constrain the nebular magnetic fields .",
    "given the association by  @xcite of the pwn with a molecular co cloud ,  an alternative interpretation of the tev emission from g54.1 + 0.3 would be radiation from the decay of neutral pions produced in the hadronic interactions produced between the dense target and the snr . to establish if this is a compatible scenario , deeper observations of this source would be needed to constrain the size and location of the accelerated particles in the tev range .",
    "a detection by fermi - lat would add data to the spectral energy distribution of the system , giving an idea of the possible role played by protons by showing ( or not ) the typical bump in the spectrum expected from neutral pions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , based on the association with a high spin - down pulsar , a comparable size of the x - ray and radio pwne given the instrument resolutions and comparison with similar detected objects , the pwn scenario best explains the data .  under the assumption that the gamma - ray production in ver j1930 + 188 is ic emission , the recently discovered ir shell of ejecta is an additional source of seed photons from the local dust up - scatted into the tev energies and contributing in the observed emission .",
