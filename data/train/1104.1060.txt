    "here we will use a picture from population dynamics .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 then is the infinitesimal variance of the local population size given its current value @xmath15 .",
    "a classical case is feller s branching diffusions where @xmath16 for @xmath15 .",
    "moreover the drift term @xmath11 describes the growth rate of a local population apart from immigration from other islands and emigration .",
    "a prototypical example is @xmath17 , i.e. logistic growth .",
    "the migration matrix @xmath18 is assumed to be a stochastic matrix .    here",
    "we address the question of the maximal effect of the migration matrix @xmath18 for fixed @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we will show in theorem  [ thm : comparison ] that the total mass process of @xmath9 is dominted by the virgin island model , which has been constructed in @xcite .",
    "this dominating process does not depend on @xmath5 or on the migration matrix .",
    "the intuition which leads to a comparison result is as follows .",
    "consider a model with supercritical population - size independent branching and additional deaths due to competition within each island of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath11 is a concave function with @xmath19 and @xmath12 is a linear function . now",
    "compare different distributions of individuals over space .",
    "if there is at most one individual on each island , then there are no deaths due to competition until the next birth or migration event . if , however , all individuals are on the same island , then there are deaths due to competition .",
    "the effect of the population - size independent branching is the same in both situations .",
    "we infer that more individuals survive if the distribution of individuals is more uniform over space . now",
    "the migration dynamics which distributes mass uniformly over space would be uniform migration on @xmath5 . as there is no uniform migration on an infinite set @xmath5 ,",
    "we approximate @xmath5 with larger and larger finite subsets and consider uniform migration on the finite subsets .",
    "this intuition leads to the assertion that the total mass of the @xmath10-process is dominated by the total mass of an _ @xmath20-island model _",
    "@xmath21 if we let @xmath22 @xmath23 for @xmath24 the @xmath20-island model @xmath21 is the solution of   with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 . we will refer to this @xmath20-island model as @xmath28-process .",
    "the initial configurations @xmath29 are assumed to converge suitably , as @xmath30 , to a sequence @xmath31 whose sum is finite .",
    "our first main result ( theorem [ thm : convergence ] ) establishes convergence of @xmath21 as @xmath30 .",
    "the limiting process turns out to be a _",
    "forest of ( mass ) excursions _ started in @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this forest of excursions has been constructed and analysed in @xcite and has been denoted as _ virgin island model_. in this model , every migrant populates a new island , similar to the infinite - allele model in which every mutation produces a new allele .",
    "jean bertoin turned this idea into a _ tree of alleles _ @xcite and a _ partition into colonies _",
    "@xcite ( see also section 7 of pardoux and wakolbinger ( 2010 ) for a connection with the virgin island model ) .",
    "in particular , bertoin @xcite shows in case of independent branching that the virgin island model is the diffusion approximation of a discrete mass branching process . in section 2",
    "we will review and discuss the virgin island model .",
    "here is a brief heuristics how a forest of ( mass ) excursions emerges from the @xmath28-processes as @xmath30 .",
    "for finite @xmath20 , every island continuously sends migrants to every other island .",
    "every once a while ( in fact , densely in time ) , a migrant is successful and found offspring which immediately find themselves interacting with the resident population on that island .",
    "for a bounded initial mass , the probability that two `` large '' populations that descended from two different founders coexist at the same time in one and the same island turns out to be negligible as @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath22 , every emigrant populates a previously unpopulated island .",
    "the evolution of the population size on every freshly populated island is described by a random ( mass ) excursion .",
    "these mass excursions are born ( densely in time ) in a poissonian manner on ever new islands with an intensity proportional to the currently extant mass , and , once born , follow the sde @xmath35 formally , this is described by means of the _ excursion measure _ @xmath36 associated with in the sense of pitman and yor ( 1982 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the intensity measure with which a path @xmath37 spawns a `` daughter '' excursion born at time @xmath4 is @xmath38 .",
    "the roots of the forest are random paths @xmath39 , @xmath33 , which are independent solutions of with @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the virgin island model is then a countable familie @xmath42 of islands where island @xmath43 is populated at time @xmath44 and carries mass @xmath45 at time @xmath46 .",
    "one tree of excursions in the forest of excursions is illustrated in figure  [ f : excursion_tree ] .",
    "note that figure  [ f : excursion_tree ] does not contain the whole tree .",
    "in fact islands are populated by emigrants densely in time but only finitely many excursions started by these emigrants reach a given strictly positive height .",
    "now a noteworthy observation is that the tree structure provides us with independence of disjoint subtrees . putting this differently , the virgin island model is a branching process in discrete time in the sense of jiina ( 1958 ) except that there are now infinitely many types , one for each excursion path . due to this branching structure ,",
    "the virgin island model is easier to study than the @xmath20-island process .",
    "several authors considered analogons of the virgin island model in the case of state - independent branching ; see @xcite for a selection of articles .    to state our convergence result of theorem  [ thm : convergence ] more formally ,",
    "denote the _ population size spectrum _ for the @xmath28-process as @xmath47 for every @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore define the population size spectrum of the virgin island model as @xmath49 our convergence result assert that the population size spectra converge in distribution , i.e. , @xmath50 in distribution as @xmath30 ; see theorem  [ thm : convergence ] for the precise statement .",
    "now we state the comparison result   more precisly .",
    "recall that @xmath11 is the infinitesimal mean in a non - spatial situation .",
    "we assume @xmath11 to be _",
    "subadditive_. then a population of size @xmath51 that is separated into two islands experiences ( in sum ) a larger growth rate than a population of the same size that is concentrated on one island . thus the virgin island model should offer in expectation a more prolific evolution of the total mass than a model with the same coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the infinitesimal variance @xmath12 has an impact on a comparison in distribution .",
    "more precisely the stochastic order in   depends on whether @xmath12 is superadditive , additive or subadditive . in our prototype example of additive @xmath12 ,",
    "the stochastic order is the usual increasing order .",
    "then we have that @xmath52 } } }    \\leq    { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbbm{e}}}}{{{\\bigl[f{{{\\bigl(\\sum_{(s,\\chi)\\in{\\ensuremath{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal v}}}}}}\\chi_{t - s}\\bigr)}}}\\bigr]}}},\\quad t\\geq0,\\ ] ] for every non - decreasing function @xmath53 . if @xmath12 is superadditve or subadditive , then we will use a concave increasing order and a convex increasing order , respectively .",
    "in fact theorem  [ thm : comparison ] is a comparison result not only on the one - dimensional , but on the finite dimensional distributions .",
    "thereby results on the distribution of the total mass of the virgin island model have an immediate impact on the distribution of interacting diffusions with local population regulation .    as a very special application of our comparison result",
    ", we obtain a sufficient condition for extinction for interacting diffusions with local population regulation . here",
    "we speak of global extinction if the total mass @xmath54 converges to zero in distribution as @xmath55 whenever @xmath56 .",
    "theorem 2 of  @xcite shows that global extinction of the virgin island model is equivalent to @xmath57 as a consequence of  , if condition   is satisfied , then the @xmath10-process dies out globally no matter what the migration matrix @xmath58 is . here",
    "are further implications of our comparison result .",
    "theorem 2 of  @xcite together with   implies an upper bound for the survival probability of @xmath9 .",
    "theorem 3 of  @xcite yields an upper bound for @xmath59 $ ] if the left - hand side of   is strictly smaller than one and an upper bound for the growth rate of @xmath60 $ ] as @xmath55 if   fails to hold .",
    "moreover theorem 4 of  @xcite implies an upper bound for the growth rate of @xmath61 as @xmath55 if   fails to hold .",
    "the limit of the @xmath20-island model is well - known if the random variables @xmath62 are exchangeable with common law @xmath63 , say .",
    "here the situation is different due to the unbounded total mass .",
    "emigrants still choose to migrate to island @xmath64 , say , with rate @xmath65 which is small in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "however , the total mass is of order @xmath20 in the case of a nontrivial exchangeable initial configuration .",
    "consequently there is a continuous immigration of migrants onto island @xmath64 even in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "moreover the dynamics of the @xmath20-island model preserves exchangeability .",
    "therefore the rate of immigration converges to the expected average over all islands as @xmath22 due to de finetti s theorem .",
    "this leads to the following limiting process .",
    "the @xmath20-island process @xmath21 converges in distribution as @xmath22 to @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , are independent processes and solve the mckean - vlasov equation @xmath69}}}\\,dt           + \\sqrt{\\sigma^2{{{\\bigl(m_t\\bigr)}}}}\\,db_t,\\quad{{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal l^{}\\left(m_0\\right)}}}=\\nu , \\end   { split}\\ ] ] see e.g.  theorem 1.4 in  @xcite for the case @xmath70 and @xmath11 bounded and globally lipschitz continuous .",
    "thus the components of the @xmath20-island process become independent in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "kac ( 1957 ) described the first known instance of this phenomenon and called it _ propagation of chaos_. after mckean ( 1967 ) , propagation of chaos has then been intensively studied in the mathematical literature , see sznitman s st .",
    "flour lecture notes @xcite .",
    "our convergence   is another instance of propagation of chaos . here",
    "independence in the limiting object is independence of disjoint subtrees .    in the prototype example of logistic branching",
    ", the mckean - vlasov equation   and the virgin island model can be interpreted as forward and backward process .",
    "corollary  [ c : duality ] shows for that case that the solution of the mckean - vlasov equation and the total mass process are dual to each other .",
    "this duality derives from a self - duality of the @xmath20-island model .",
    "this self - duality in turn derives from pathwise forward and backward processes in a graphical representation , see  @xcite . so in our prototype example , the virgin island model may be interpreted as backward process of the solution of the mckean - vlasov equation .",
