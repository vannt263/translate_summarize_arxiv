    "the relative phase between the luminosity and the velocity curves in classical pulsating variables was a puzzle in the early days of variable star modeling . because , overall , the pulsations are only weakly nonadiabatic it was expected that the maximum brightness should occur at maximum compression , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  minimum radius , whereas in reality it is observed to occur close to maximum velocity .",
    "( to avoid confusion we note that in this paper we use astro - centric velocities , @xmath2 . )",
    "the luminosity thus has a @xmath3 phase lag compared to the one expected adiabatically .    as it became possible to make accurate linear and nonlinear calculations of the whole envelope , including in particular the outer neutral hydrogen region , agreement between modeling and observation",
    "was achieved .",
    "however , it was @xcite who first provided a qualitative _ physical _ understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "he pointed out that during the compression phase , for example , the hydrogen partial ionization front moves outward with respect to the fluid , and energy is removed from the heat flow to ionize matter . because of this temporary storage of energy - as in the charging of a capacitor - the h acts acts like a low - pass filter , causing a phase lag of close to 90 degrees .",
    "however , the exact value of the phase lag depends sensitively on details of the stellar model , and can only be obtained by detailed simulations .",
    "an understanding of the phase lag involves physics both in the linear and the nonlinear regimes .",
    "this characteristic makes it an ideal benchmark to test existing hydrocodes against observational constraints .",
    "cepheids are known to have humps or bumps on the light curves , especially near maximum light . rather than define the phases with respect to maximum light , or some other chosen reference point , it is therefore desirable to define them in terms of a fourier sum : @xmath4 the phase lag @xmath1 = ( @xmath5 ) is thus defined as the difference between the phases of the fundamental components of the fourier fits of the radial velocity ( @xmath6 ) and magnitude curves .",
    "the two time sequences are of course reduced to the same time origin ( epoch ) .",
    "good galactic cepheid light curve data have been available for a long time , while radial velocity data are more recent . @xcite",
    "have published the phase lags for a set of fundamental ( f ) and first overtone ( o1 ) cepheids and have found that for the f cepheids @xmath1 is largely independent of pulsational period , with an average value of 0.28 , but that for the o1 cepheids it decreases with period from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we describe the results of an extended survey of the linear and the nonlinear ( full amplitude ) cepheid pulsation models , and we revisit the phase lag problem . in our computations",
    "we make use of the state - of - the - art florida - budapest hydrocode @xcite which includes a model for turbulent convection .",
    "our goal is to compare the modeling results with a turbulent convective hydrocode for the phase lag with the available observational data .",
    "the last similar systematic phase lag investigation was carried out by @xcite using early radiative hydrocodes and opacities .",
    "furthermore , the limited number of their models , and the quality of the observations that were available at the time justify a new look at the problem .",
    "with the usual convenient , but excellent assumptions of a chemically homogeneous envelope and a rigid , nonpulsating core , we can then specify a cepheid envelope by three parameters for a given composition : effective temperature ( @xmath9 ) , luminosity ( @xmath10 ) and stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "since the cepheid tracks are more or less horizontal ( fixed @xmath10 ) it is customary and expedient ( but not necessary ) to identify these tracks by an @xmath11-@xmath10  relation , @xmath17 .",
    "this reduces the number of stellar parameters by one , and we can thus make one - parameter sequences of models for a given mass @xmath11 and composition , with @xmath9  as the single parameter .",
    "the selected @xmath11-@xmath10  relation however affects the whole picture from modal selection , to mass - period relation , to phase lags .",
    "the @xmath11-@xmath10  relations are usually obtained from evolutionary calculations .",
    "the problems with evolutionary tracks producing cepheids and the difficulty of deriving mass - luminosity relations are well known and are addressed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make use of three different @xmath11-@xmath10  relations .",
    "our first @xmath11-@xmath10  relation is a fit to the evolutionary tracks with a nonzero overshooting parameter of @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite give an @xmath11-@xmath10  relation that is a fit to their evolutionary tracks without overshooting .",
    "third , one can also bypass evolution calculations and combine observational data with pulsational theory .",
    "this has been done for the smc and the lmc by @xcite who derived stellar masses from the observed magnitudes , colors and periods , but reddening errors prevented the extraction of a very tight @xmath11-@xmath10  relation .",
    "an alternative is to pinpoint the @xmath18 resonance center from the behavior of the fourier phase @xmath19 as a function of period , and then use linear modeling to match the resonance condition and thus tie down a resonance @xmath11-@xmath10  relation , which is assumed to be linear : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is 0.7328 , 0.96864 , 1.1552 for @xmath13 = 0.020 , 0.010 and 0.004 , respectively .",

    "the equilibrium models are initiated with a velocity kick in one of the eigenmodes and the desired full amplitude ( limit cycle ) pulsations are computed with our hydrocode .",
    "the regime where the f and o1 modes are simultaneously linearly unstable is well known to split into two types , depending on the stellar parameters , namely a double - mode regime , where both modes achieve full amplitude , and a hysteretic regime  the either ",
    "or regime in the pulsation jargon  where f and o1 limit cycles coexist , and the initial kick determines which of the two limit cycles is attained .",
    "a similar split occurs for the o1 and o2 modes .",

    "[ fig : is ] . in the domain of astrophysical parameters that are relevant for cepheids , only the f , o1 and o2 modes are unstable . as to the definitions of linear and nonlinear edges we refer to the literature , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite and in particular figs .  4 and 5 in @xcite whose notation we will use here , namely * l * for linear and * n * for nonlinear , with * be * for the blue edge and * re * for the red edge .",
    "[ fig : is ] shows that the region of linear instability of the f mode extends to very high luminosities . that of the o1 mode resembles a sugar cone ,",

    "similarly the o2 is sugar cone , with a yet lower maximum luminosity , overlaps with both the o1 and f iss . along the solid lines",
    "the linear and nonlinear edges coincide , and the pulsation amplitudes vanish there ( see @xcite for a more thorough discussion of how the behavior at the edges of the is is affected by stellar evolution ) .",
    "the dashed parts of the linear instability boundaries are not real edges because an evolving star that is pulsating in a given mode undergoes a switch ( bifurcation ) to another type of pulsation before it can reach the dashed line corresponding to the original pulsation mode .",
    "the substructure in the topography of the is will be discussed in a paper on beat cepheids @xcite .    for the purposes of this paper we note that because the star pulsates with infinitesimal amplitude near the solid edges , the linear and nonlinear phase lags therefore approach each other .",
    "all other mode switching occurs with finite amplitude and the linear and nonlinear @xmath33 differ therefore at the bifurcation",
    ". this behavior will clearly be visible in the subsequent figures .",
    "thus for example , a star on a blueward horizontal track at high luminosity in fig .",
    "[ fig : is ] starts to pulsate with infinitesimal amplitude when it crosses the fre ( the solid line on the right ) and stays in this mode until it reaches the fbe ( solid line ) on the left where its pulsation amplitude goes to zero .",
    "the linear and nonlinear @xmath33 should thus be equal to each other both at the fre and at the fbe .",
    "in contrast , a star on a blueward track at mid - magnitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : is ] similarly starts to pulsate when it crosses the fre ( the solid line on the right ) , but it bifurcates to some other pulsational state before it reaches the lfbe ( the dotted line corresponding to the f mode ) .",
    "the amplitude of the pulsation does not go to zero at the switching which has as a consequence that the linear and nonlinear @xmath33 are different .",
    "finally , we note that because of the @xmath11-@xmath10  relation , the ordinate in the schematic fig .",
    "[ fig : is ] could also represent the stellar mass @xmath11 .    in the two hysteretic regimes , where the pulsation is periodic",
    ", it can be in either the f or the o1 mode , or it can be in either the o1 or o2 mode , respectively . in this regime",
    "we include the corresponding model in both the f and the o1 set of pulsators .",
    "the double - mode pulsations of two types that have been encountered , namely f&o1 and o1&o2 , are ignored here because of their multi - periodic nature .",
    "they will be discussed in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the temperature range of the double - mode region is typically less then @xmath34 , therefore the exclusion of these models has little effect on the results of this paper .",
    "the general picture of the theoretical linear and nonlinear phase lags is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : linnl]a .",
    "these results are obtained by using the resonance @xmath11-@xmath10  relation , the turbulent convective parameter set  a ( table  [ tab_alphae ] ) , and a galactic metallicity ( z=0.020 ) .",
    "below we investigate how each of these three choices affects the results .",
    "the phase lags are plotted as a function of the logarithm of the period of the excited mode(the models in the either f or o1 regime appear twice , once under @xmath35 and once under @xmath36 ) .",
    "our models form one - parameter sequences at a given @xmath11 , and thus @xmath37 , with @xmath9  as the variable parameter .",
    "the masses of the sequences run from 2.5@xmath23  to 9.5@xmath23 , with a 0.5@xmath23  increment , and are labeled by the small ( integer ) numbers .",
    "the f , o1 and o2 groups start with the same masses on the left .",
    "the dotted lines depict the linear phase lags of the linearly unstable models , while the thick lines correspond to the nonlinear phase lags , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  those of the limit cycles .",
    "( some inter / extrapolation has been done near the edges . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : linnl]a one can identify the three separate clusters that correspond to the f , o1 and o2 radial pulsation modes of the sequences of models . for high masses ,",
    "the nonlinear sequences follow the linear ones of the same mass . at a certain mass",
    "o1 pulsation appears , thus the nonlinear f curves stop before reaching the fbe , and the sequence continues in the corresponding o1 curve . in the either - or regions , the same model contributes to two pulsational modes .",
    "the same thing happens where the sequences change from o1 to o2 pulsation at even lower mass .",
    "therefore the f and o1 sequences seem to be increasingly incomplete toward the short periods at low mass . at the lowest mass regime ,",
    "the models reach the blue edge pulsating in the o2 mode .",
    "as expected , the f mode pulsations cover the broadest range in period and in mass , as well as in phase lag .",
    "we remark in advance that when comparing the theoretical values of the phase lags to observations the most relevant part of these arches are the broad vicinity of their maxima , because the long legs on the high period ( right ) side of the sequences are associated with low pulsational amplitudes , near the fre .",
    "we will return to this issue . along the sequences",
    "the dots mark 100k intervals which allows one to see that the models are not equidistant along the @xmath33 in fig .  [ fig : linnl ] , but that they crowd toward the center of the is and are increasingly spaced out toward the fre .",
    "the fre is the lower envelope of the f sequences on the figure , corresponding to infinitesimal pulsational amplitude .",
    "the spacing is increasing toward the low mass models , too .",
    "the maximum f phase lags of the models thus lie close to zero , while the bulk of our models are in the 0.1 to 0.4 range .",
    "the phase lags for the o1 and the o2 pulsations of the sequences are located lower on the diagram to the left . with the chosen set  a of @xmath32 parameters",
    "the maximum o1 period is @xmath38@xmath39 , and the maximum o2 period is @xmath40@xmath39 .",
    "the cepheids pulsating with the maximum o1 period are close to the lobe , and therefore low amplitudes are expected to hamper their discovery ( see @xcite for a similar comment ) .",
    "the same argument applies for the maximum o2 period , although no galactic o2 cepheids have been found to date .",
    "we need to point out that this maximum o1 period is sensitive to the turbulent convective parameters that we use .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ alphas ] and a thorough calibration will be attempted in @xcite .",
    "we note however , that our phase lag results do not seem very affected by changes in @xmath32s as long as we use a parameter combination that reproduces the maximum o1 period .",
    "it is well known that internal resonances cause structure in the fourier coefficients _ vs.  _ period or some other parameter , ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the light curves of rr lyrae who have no low - order internal resonances exhibit very smooth fourier decomposition coefficients ( @xmath41 , etc ) , whereas the cepheids which span a much wider range of @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath9encounter a number of such resonances during their evolution through the is ( see for example fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we will see that these resonance characteristics play a role in this study .",
    "this may come as a surprise because one might have thought that resonances affect for light curves and radial velocity curves and that their effect would balance out in @xmath42 .",
    "this is however not the case because the resonance induced distortions are different for light and for radial velocity .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the differences between the nonlinear and linear phase lags , @xmath43 , vanish at the is edges .",
    "this is depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : linnl]a , especially for the f and o1 sequences .",
    "the @xmath44  are very small for the o2 pulsators which have very low amplitudes .",
    "generally , one expects that the larger the amplitude the larger the difference between the linear and nonlinear quantities such as the phase lag .",
    "this simple argument may break down where there are resonances which distort the light and radial velocity curves .",
    "the largest @xmath44  are found around @xmath35 = 10@xmath39  for the f pulsators , but it is not immediately clear whether this is related to the well - known @xmath45 resonance , or whether it is just a broad minimum occurring there by coincidence , as part of a general trend running through the whole mass range . to resolve the issue , we display the @xmath43  values on fig .",
    "[ fig : linnl]b .",
    "the o1 and o2 sequences are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "the @xmath43  are positive for the highest mass values , and tend to be negative for lower masses . for a given mass sequence its absolute value is largest toward the middle of the instability strip .",
    "we point out that this figure is very similar for the @xmath43  for lmc and smc metallicities that are discussed in sec .",
    "[ met_eff ] .",
    "the @xmath43  tend to be more negative in the vicinity of the resonance , and they do not extend to the positive region . on the low period side @xmath43  changes abruptly due to the distortion of the light and velocity curves that is caused by the resonance .",
    "based on these findings , we conclude , that the @xmath45 resonance has a noticeable effect on the phase lags . namely , an additional dip appears on the upper envelope of the arched nonlinear phase lags which is very pronounced around the resonance center .",
    "the log p ",
    "diagram shows , that the resonance related distortion plays an equally important role in shaping the phase lag curves as the amplitudes themselves . the same resonance behavior will be noticed in the lmc and the smc metallicity models around the apposite resonance periods confirming our argument .",
    "similarly , we believe that the surprisingly large @xmath46 that are found for the o1 modes of the 5.5 @xmath23  sequence are associated with the @xmath47 resonance near an overtone period @xmath48 period . this resonance causes the either or region to broaden to a width of several hundred k @xcite , which is in turn reflected in the much longer o1 phase lag curve .",
    "the much shorter 6@xmath23  curve is still affected by the resonance , as its strange shape and the large @xmath43  indicate .",

    "our experience is that , as long as they are capable of reproducing the observed mode selection patterns , the turbulent @xmath32 parameters do not have a major effect on the phase lags .      we have adopted here the following composition pairs ( x , z ) = ( 0.700 , 0.020 ) , ( 0.716 , 0.010 ) , ( 0.726 , 0.004 ) as canonical values when computing galactic , lmc , and smc models , respectively .    in fig .",

    "this does not cause a problem though , because the evolutionary tracks also shift with @xmath13 . also , our maximum predicted o2 periods are close to maximum o2 period reported for o1&o2 double mode cepheids in the lmc @xcite and in the smc @xcite .",
    "so far we have only considered a solar mix where the metals are lumped collectively into z. however , it has been found that deviations from the standard solar chemical composition @xcite play a nonnegligible role in beat cepheid period ratios @xcite .",

    "the phase lags are found to be largely insensitive to the chemical buildup , the difference is largest for high mass models , being less than 0.01 , and in general it is much less .    after having demonstrated that the phase lags are moderately sensitive to metallicity and that they implicitly depend on the @xmath11-@xmath10  relation and the turbulent convective parameters , we examine other possible physical and numerical effects on the cepheid phase lags .",
    "for these tests we have computed only _ linear _ models , because the relationship between nonlinear and linear phase lags is not strongly affected , and this will therefore not significantly alter our conclusions .      in this section",
    "we consider the effect of _ stellar rotation _ because it has the effect of rearranging the stellar structure , and can cause slight changes in the phase lags . however , since we do not have the 3d code to conduct a proper calculation of the effects of rotation , we resort to an expedient subterfuge which we expect to be accurate enough as an order of magnitude estimate . as in @xcite and",
    "references therein we incorporate in our 1d hydrocode a radial pseudo - centrifugal force of the form ( @xmath61 ) which , if anything , is likely to overestimate the effects of rotation .",
    "we find that even up to 20 @xmath62 rotation , the phase lags are indistinguishable from the nonrotating ones , except perhaps for the highest masses ( > 9@xmath23 ) , where the relative difference is still only 0.02 .",
    "we note that observed cepheid rotation rates ( @xmath63 ) are usually less than 20 @xmath62 @xcite .",

    "we have used 120 zones in our models , which is sufficient to generate decent light curves .",
    "as the phase lag itself is sensitive to the structure of the outer stellar layers , different zoning in this region can potentially influence the lag between the velocity and luminosity maxima .",
    "we have recomputed some of our galactic models with 80 and 300 zones .",
    "the linear phase lags turned out to be rather insensitive to the zoning .",
    "the difference is the smallest for the low period models , and increases toward higher masses .",
    "the maximum deviation is @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we conclude that different model zoning has practically no influence on @xmath1 .",
    "so far we have compared _ bolometric _ theoretical light curves to observed _ v magnitudes _ when constructing the _ phase lags_. in principle , this inconsistency could cause a problem .",
    "obviously the velocity curves are free from this caveat .",
    "however , we think that v phase lags are close to their bolometric counterpart , because the @xmath9  of the cepheid variables ensures that the maximum of their spectral energy distribution is close to the v band .",
    "the @xmath65 values for v and i , for example , are indeed found to be very close @xcite . for a more detailed comparison of the v ,",
    "b , r , i and bolometric light curve parameters we refer to @xcite .    however , in order to compare our computed amplitudes to the _ observed galactic amplitudes _ we need to convert from our bolometric amplitudes to v amplitudes : @xmath66 . for this transformation",
    "we follow @xcite , _ viz .  _",
    "@xmath67 these fits to the static atmosphere models were derived for beat cepheids , but @xcite obtained similar formulae for a broader mass range , the difference being only a small systematic shift between the two ( @xmath68 ) . neglecting the @xmath69 term in the bc formula does nt affect our conclusions .",
    "the introduced error is @xmath70 for our lowest and highest temperature models , generally being much less than that .    on fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] the @xmath71 fourier coefficients of the v light curves are shown for the @xcite sample together with our full amplitude models .",

    "f cepheids are denoted by squares , overtones by triangles .",
    "the @xmath71 amplitudes are plotted for our model sequences with 4@xmath23to 9.5@xmath23  for f , and with 4 to 7@xmath23  for o1 models , computed by using the resonance @xmath11-@xmath10  relation and set  a of convective parameters .",
    "since we have not computed nonlinear model pulsations at very low amplitude , we have extrapolated our results to zero amplitude , where applicable , _ i.e. _ ,  at the f red edge and at the o1 blue edge .    fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] shows good agreement between the model calculations and the observations .",
    "the only small discrepancy is that the o1 cepheids do not seem to extend to quite high enough periods , but this partially is due to the coarse grid we used ( 100k ) . because of this , for the 7.5@xmath23sequence we do not find stable nonlinear o1 pulsation , while by using a finer grid we could find a narrow temperature range of overtone pulsation .",
    "it s important to notice that fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] also appears to show a large observational bias toward large amplitude cepheids , especially among the fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "this fact has important consequences for the observed phase lag distribution .",
    "this issue is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_obs ] .",
    "we now turn to the effects of resonances on our amplitude diagram .",
    "the action of the @xmath18 resonance between the f mode and the second overtone , which is at the origin of the well known hertzsprung progression , is quite visible near @xmath35 = 10@xmath39  in the m=6@xmath23sequence .",
    "it causes a dip in the @xmath71 values .",
    "our models duly follow the observed amplitude minimum .    a corresponding overtone resonance between the fourth and first overtone @xmath72 appears at @xmath73 in the o1 sequences of the m=5.5@xmath23  sequence .",
    "in this case one has to keep in mind that it is easier to locate the resonance position from the velocity curves than form the light curves .",
    "@xcite found the resonance to be centered on @xmath74 ( although with a slightly different @xmath11-@xmath10  relation ) .",
    "the small distortion and the larger dip between the m=5.5 and m=6@xmath23  overtone amplitude curves corresponding to this resonance are not seen in the observed sample .",
    "the likely reason is the small number of observed o1 cepheids , and the uncertain mode identification in galactic cepheids .",
    "the @xmath75 resonance @xcite has no visible effect , neither on the computed phase lag nor on the @xmath76 diagrams .",
    "@xcite showed that another possible resonance , @xmath77 @xcite has no effect unless it destabilizes the f limit cycle , in which case it causes the appearance of slightly alternating pulsation cycles ( period doubling ) .",
    "such pulsations were reported by @xcite in radiative cepheid models , but not in the sequences of turbulent models that we have computed here .",
    "no observational evidence has yet shown up to corroborate the existence of alternating cycles in cepheids of this period range .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that the amplitudes of our models reproduce the observed amplitudes , as well as the resonance characteristics .",
    "furthermore , we have pointed out a deficiency of observed small amplitude cepheids on our amplitude diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] .",
    "these features are important regarding the following section , in which the observed and theoretical phase lags are compared , and an explanation is proposed for the observed phase lag distribution for both f and o1 cepheids .",
    "at this time only phase lags from galactic cepheids have been reported in the literature @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_alpha]a we have plotted these observational galactic phase lags .",
    "the f cepheids and o1 cepheids denoted by squares and triangles , respectively .",
    "they are superposed on the linear and nonlinear phase lags that we have computed with our standard reference parameters in this paper , namely the convective parameter set  a ( a. ) panel ) , the resonance @xmath11-@xmath10  relation and a galactic metallicity ( @xmath54 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : linnl]a and [ fig : obs_alpha ] it is seen that our model sequences extend over a much broader range of periods than the observational data .",
    "the simple reason is that our sequences are not constrained by the evolutionary tracks ( except for the @xmath11-@xmath10  relation ) , and thus they cover a much larger range of stellar parameter values ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , the observed stars strikingly occupy only the upper section of the region in the @xmath1 _ vs.  _ log @xmath78 diagram that is permitted by the modeling .",
    "this region corresponds to the inside region of the is;in other words the observed f sample seems to avoid the vicinity of the f red edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linnl]a ) .",
    "we argue that this arises from an observational amplitude bias .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] suggests that the low amplitude cepheids are missing from the observed sample , most likely because of observational selection effects .",
    "we note though that there is also a theoretical reason for the absence of low amplitude cepheids @xcite . in all our log p - @xmath1 figures ,",
    "[ fig : linnl]a and [ fig : mlrel ] the bottoms of the downward legs of the fundamental @xmath1 curves correspond to the fre and thus to models with pulsation amplitudes that vanish as the fre is approached .",
    "in addition , towards the red edge the phase lags of the f cepheid models are extremely sensitive to temperature as witnessed from the spacing of the dots in fig .  [ fig : linnl]a .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]b juxtaposes the theoretical nonlinear f phase lags and the @xcite sample . as discussed in  4 the f models sequences terminate at finite amplitude at the nonlinear fundamental blue edge ( nfbe ) , because the model sequence switches either to double mode or to o1 single mode pulsation at that point .",
    "overall the agreement of the model phase lags with the observational ones is good ( differences of 0.1 rad translate to only about 6@xmath79 ) .",
    "however , a few systematic discrepancies stand out .",
    "for example , the observational f cepheid phase lags fall slightly above the theoretical ones in the middle range of periods .",
    "but , from a comparison of fig .  [ fig : obs_alpha]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : metal ] we see that this discrepancy would be mitigated or even removed if we decreased the metal content that we have assumed for the galactic cepheid models , in line with a recent revision of the solar metal abundances @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]b lines of pulsation equi - amplitude ( cutoffs ) are overplotted from @xmath80 at the fre to @xmath81 . to avoid confusion",
    "we caution that these lines refer _ only _ to the rising parts of the @xmath33 curves near the fre.(there may be multiple equi - amplitude lines because the pulsation amplitudes are not just a function of period and @xmath33;the same amplitude can occur more than once along the same arch , but generally not on the same line . )    based on fig .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]b we can see that the lower limit of the observed amplitude distribution is well represented by the @xmath81 and @xmath82 cutoff lines for @xmath8310@xmath39and @xmath8410@xmath39 , respectively .",
    "this dichotomy and the sharp change in the equi - amplitude lines on the @xmath1    log  p plane around 10 days has its origin in the @xmath18 resonance discussed above .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]b together with fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] confirm our hypothesis that observational selection effects make the observed sample gravitate toward the high amplitude region .      on fig .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]a we display the region of o1 models separately , to avoid overcrowding .",
    "five individual stars that are mentioned below are labeled and plotted with open symbols .",
    "as discussed in  4 the o1 models sequences terminate at finite amplitude at the nore , because the model sequences continue as f single mode pulsation to the right of that point .",
    "the @xmath72 resonance is seen to have a remarkable effect on the m=5.5@xmath23   and m=6.0@xmath23  phase lags .",
    "as is seen most sharply in the 5.5@xmath23  sequence the resonance causes @xmath33 to drop sharply below its value at the blue edge as the nonlinear overtone red edge ( nore ) is reached .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]a we have also shown the phase lags of 4.5 , 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 and 6.5@xmath23  sequences computed with the girardi @xmath11-@xmath10  relations .",
    "they are shown as dashed lines .",
    "( the 6@xmath23  curves are almost indistinguishable for the two different @xmath11-@xmath10  relations ) .",

    "again , reducing the metallicity would at least partially mitigate the difference .",
    "most of the discrepancy occurs because of 3 really egregious stars , two with @xmath85 ( ir cep and v950 sco ) , and the long period v440 per with @xmath86 .",
    "for the first two , strong evidence has been given on the basis of the fourier decomposition parameters of the light and radial velocity curves that they are o1 pulsators ( moskalik , private communication ) .",
    "however , according to their location in the phase lag diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_alpha]a , at least , they would quite naturally fit in the f , rather than in the o1 group .",
    "alternatively , the disagreement for ir cep would also disappear if its metallicity was somewhat below the average galactic metallicity , although this would not apply as well for the longer period v950 sco .",
    "v440 per has a low amplitude of @xmath71=0.095 , and an enormous error bar for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "it is classified as the longest period galactic o1 cepheid .",

    "[ fig : masslum ] in the 5.5 to 6.0 @xmath23  range should push the computed @xmath33 a little further to the right and improve the agreement for the stars with @xmath87 , and in particular for my pup .",

    "currently being a low amplitude pulsator with @xmath88 @xcite , it resides relatively close to our blue edge on the log p - @xmath1 plot   @xcite .",
    "however this agreement should be taken with a grain of salt , because this star can be in the phase of crossing the instability strip for the first time @xcite thus bearing a different @xmath11-@xmath10  relation than most of the cepheids ( see _ e.g. _ ,  fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , then evaluating it s position on fig .",
    "[ fig : vmag_cutoff]a would require more computational work with the appropriate @xmath11-@xmath10  relation , which is out of scope of this paper .",
    "finally we note that on a large scale the o1 phase lag distribution appears essentially linear @xcite . if the three egregious stars are removed from the o1 cepheids then not only does the observational phase lag distribution appears curved , but that our results closely match its general shape ( albeit being a little lower ) .",
    "we have also shown that the curvature of the distribution has its origin in the @xmath36 : @xmath35 = 2:3 resonance .",
    "recently ultra - low amplitude ( ula ) cepheids have been discovered in the lmc @xcite . based on this work",
    "we predict that ula cepheids pulsating in the f mode and close to the fundamental red edge , would feature a greater ( negative ) phase lag , and would fall below the current observed range of the regular amplitude cepheids .",
    "also , ula o1 cepheids with periods far from the resonance center would be close to the lower envelope of the predicted phase lag distribution .    our fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_alpha ] offers a method for radial mode identification for cepheids that is additional and complementary to the usual relative fourier decomposition coefficients ( @xmath89 , etc ) .",
    "we see that it offers not only a criterion for the f and o1 cepheids , but also for the elusive galactic o2 cepheids .",
    "there clearly is an observational bias against low period - low amplitude cepheids .",
    "however , considering the existence of a galactic o1&o2 beat cepheid ( co aur ) it is quite likely that pure o2 cepheids exist as well .",
    "the phase lag has the potential of sorting the elusive galactic o2 cepheids from o1 cepheids",
    ".    observed and theoretical fourier parameters of cepheid light curves have been often investigated , see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite for long period f cepheid fourier decomposition , @xcite for f phase lags .",
    "other previous theoretical works on o1 cepheid pulsations @xcite and on o2 cepheid pulsations @xcite cepheids also discussed the phase lags .",
    "however , these authors ignored convection and produced purely _ radiative _ models , an approximation which makes sense only near the blue edge .",
    "the resulting large range of f and o1 phase lags led @xcite to conclude that @xmath1 is not a useful discriminator for the pulsational mode .",
    "one problem may be that _ radiative _ models have excessively large amplitudes . because the nonlinear phase lags depend largely on the amplitude , as we pointed out in sec .",
    "[ alphas ] we think that to address the phase lag problem correctly , convection can not be left out from the models .",
    "in this paper we have reexamined the classical cepheid phase lags , @xmath90 , with our hydrocode which includes a time - dependent mixing length model for turbulent convection .",
    "as expected , the linear and nonlinear ( full amplitude ) phase lags approach each other when the pulsation amplitude is low , as for example near the fundamental red edge of the instability strip .",
    "the nonlinear phase lags generally fall below the linear ones except for high period models where they lie above .",

    "there are however no sufficiently good observations to confirm this .",
    "the convective @xmath32 parameters have a strong influence on the modal selection in the instability strip , as well as on the pulsation amplitude , which is then reflected in the period  @xmath1 diagram .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11-@xmath10  relations have only an indirect effect on the phase lags through a modification of the mass  period relation .",
    "we obtain a good general agreement between the observed galactic cepheid phase lag data of @xcite and our models . for the f cepheids this agreement",
    "can be further improved when the observed amplitude distribution is taken into account . by applying cutoff magnitude ( equi - amplitude ) lines",
    "we can restrict the model phase lags region to the approximate observed range [ @xmath91 .",
    "an almost perfect agreement can be achieved by lowering the assumed metallicity of @xmath54 in accordance with the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "our computed o1 phase lags seem to fall on a steeper relation than the observations , but this discrepancy would be mitigated or removed if we could reclassify two stars , ir cep and v950 sco as f cepheids ( even though fourier decomposition parameters of the light and radial velocity curves indicate otherwise ) .",
    "furthermore , the phase lag of the outlier , v440 per , which is normally classified as an overtone , would be compatible with the theoretical phase lag of a low amplitude f cepheid . with the omission of these three stars",

    "we have shown that resonances have an impact on the phase lag .",
    "the @xmath18 resonance which is present in the fundamental mode cepheids at around 10@xmath39  period and causes the well - known hertzsprung - progression , has a small effect on the minimum in the nonlinear phase lags ( fig .",

    "however , no o2 cepheids have been detected in the galaxy , but there are a number of candidates in the magellanic clouds . for an independent confirmation of their status as o2 on the basis of the phase lag it would be necessary to acquire radial velocity data on these objects .",
