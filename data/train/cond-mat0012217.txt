    "the discovery of photoluminescence ( pl ) in the visible regime @xcite from porous silicon has prompted many experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations @xcite , both because of the implications of this phenomenon in the fabrication of silicon - based optoelectronic devices and the interest in understanding this phenomenon .",
    "the intensive research following this discovery seemed to suggest that strong optical transitions can be expected only from those si - based systems which have an effective reduced dimensionality .",
    "structural studies of porous si showed that porous si is composed of si nanostructures in the forms of columns and clusters @xcite .",
    "hence , the ensuing research efforts have placed emphasis on the electronic and optical properties of silicon nanoclusters .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observation of enhanced pl .",
    "the first suggests that the strong pl in the visible regime is due to the enhancement of the momentum matrix elements associated with the confinement of the electronic wavefunctions @xcite of silicon nanoparticles .",
    "the second suggests that the surface chemical composition of silicon nanostructures may also play a key role in the enhanced pl @xcite . in both mechanisms",
    "proposed , the existence of a clean energy gap plays a pivotal role in determining the efficiency of the luminescence .",
    "furthermore , since the pl for the bulk crystalline silicon is in the near infrared regime while it is in the visible regime for silicon nanoparticles , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of size dependence of the gap of si nanoparticles @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on issues that are relevant to the fabrication of device - quality silicon nanostructures .",
    "experimentally , it is difficult to control the number of atoms in a silicon nanocluster . in most cases",
    ", the experimentally prepared samples of silicon nano - clusters may not possess the full tetrahedral symmetry of the bulk crystal .",
    "however , the previous theoretical studies , particularly those pertaining to the size - dependence of the energy gap , focused on highly symmetric configuration where the surface dangling bonds are completely passivated by hydrogen atoms so that the system possesses the regular tetrahedral bonding configuration . in this work",
    ", we will compare the results for nanoclusters with overall symmetry to those with no overall symmetry .",
    "we will consider both hydrogen - passivated clusters and those with no hydrogen passivation .",
    "finally , we will consider both unrelaxed and relaxed nanoclusters .",
    "more specifically , we will address the following issues : i ) how to obtain a clean energy gap in the case of silicon nanoclusters ?",
    "( ii ) what is the nature of the gap states ? ( iii ) what is the role of relaxation and hydrogen passivation on the energy gap and gap states ?",
    "( iv ) is there an intrinsic relationship between the energy gap and the local bonding configuration ? and",
    "( v ) how is a nanocluster with full symmetry different from a cluster with no overall symmetry with regard to the existence of a clean gap ?    in this work we have used a combination of theoretical studies to investigate the structure , the stability , the energy gap , and the electronic density of states of the nanocluster .",
    "we use the non - orthogonal tight - binding ( notb ) molecular dynamics @xcite to determine the structure of silicon nanoclusters . for sizes of the cluster with @xmath3",
    ", we have used the order - n [ o(n ) ] technique , as developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to determine the equilibrium structure . similarly , to circumvent the difficulties associated with an accurate calculation of the energy gap of a large cluster ,",
    "we have devised a method , as described in the appendix of this paper , that directly computes the eigenvalues corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) without having to obtain the entire eigenvalue spectrum . finally , the electronic density of states are calculated using the real - space green s function ( rsgf ) technique as developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider si nanoclusters with no overall tetrahedral symmetry ( e.g. @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) and illustrate how the relaxation of such systems , while leading to the stability of the system , precludes the formation of a clean energy gap . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider a silicon nanocluster with overall tetrahedral symmetry ( e.g. @xmath7 and investigate in detail the role of hydrogen passivation on the stability , the energy gap , and gap states of such a cluster . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the hydrogen passivation of clusters with no overall tetrahedral symmetry and compare our results with the case discussed in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "v , the variation of the energy gap as a function of the size of the hydrogen - passivated nanocluster with no overall symmetry is given .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we present the formalism used in this paper for the calculation of homo and lumo energies of a large cluster .",
    "a nano - cluster , left to itself , will search for a stable configuration by relaxation and `` surface '' reconstruction .",
    "the process is triggered by the tendency of a cluster to minimize its total energy with the elimination of the dangling bonds associated with the exterior atoms .",
    "but it often comes at a price as it causes severe distortion of the bonds , in particular of the exterior atoms @xcite . as a result",
    ", defect states associated with bond distortions are expected to appear .",
    "furthermore , relaxation may not completely eliminate the dangling bonds on the surface .",
    "hence there will also be defect states associated with remnant dangling bonds .",
    "both these defect states may fall in the gap region , making the gap less clean or even `` dirty '' .    to verify the validity of this picture ,",
    "we have performed the full - geometry optimization of si nanoclusters of different sizes and then determine their edos . in our calculation , we have deliberately chosen to study @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the number of atoms in these clusters is such that they form incomplete shells when the atoms are made to occupy the regular tetrahedral network sites .",
    "therefore , such clusters will not possess the overall tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "the notb hamiltonian used in this work @xcite has been extensively used in the literature and is known to yield reliable structures for si clusters @xcite and si(100 ) surface @xcite . when the number of atoms ( @xmath1 ) in the cluster exceeds 500 , we have used the order - n technique as developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to overcome the @xmath8 bottleneck in the computation of total energy and atomic forces .    in our simulations , a stable configuration for a cluster of a given size is considered to have been reached if the magnitude of the force acting on each atom is of the order @xmath9 and the total energy of the configuration is a minimum .",
    "fig.1 shows the optimized structure for si@xmath10 .",
    "it can be seen that the interior of the cluster has the bulk - like tetrahedral structure . on the `` surface '' of this cluster ,",
    "features resembling the adatoms in the si(111)7x7 reconstruction,@xcite and dimer rows associated with si(100)@xcite have emerged .",
    "the general features of the other clusters studied are similar to those characterizing the si@xmath10 cluster , namely , the bonding configurations of the interior atoms are bulk - like and the surface features exhibit the characteristics of the most stable surface reconstruction of si @xcite .",
    "however , the bonding configurations of exterior atoms show more severe distortions from the regular tetrahedral network as the size of the cluster decreases .",
    "a survey of the exterior atoms in these clusters ( see fig.1 ) shows that most of them are 3-fold bonded .",
    "thus , most of the dangling bonds associated with the unrelaxed exterior atoms have been eliminated by the surface reconstruction , specifically the tendency of the si atoms on the `` surface '' to dimerize or the capping of the dangling bonds by adatoms . from fig.1 , it can be seen that , as a result of reconstruction such as dimerization or capping , the bonding configurations associated with the exterior atoms are distorted from the regular tetrahedral network , some more so than others .    in fig.2 ,",
    "the electronic density of states ( edos ) of the stable configuration of si@xmath11 clusters for @xmath1=200 , 800 , and 2000 are shown , where the energy of the homo for each case is taken to be zero .",
    "a key feature which stands out in all three plots of density of states is that there is no well - defined energy gap above the homo ( e=0 ) in the band gap region of a semiconducting si system . instead ,",
    "defect states due to the remnant dangling bonds and distorted bonding configurations are found in the gap region .",
    "this calculation demonstrates that the disappearance of a clean gap is the price for achieving the stability of a si nano - cluster on its own . in other words",
    ", a `` pure '' and stable si nano - cluster will not have a well - defined gap which is comparable to the gap of a bulk si .",
    "previous theoretical studies on hydrogen - passivated _ unrelaxed _ si clusters with an overall symmetry and no local bond distortion have shown the existence of a clean and well - defined energy gap and that the gap is blue - shifted as the size of the nano - cluster is reduced @xcite . however , the role of hydrogen passivation in eliminating the defect states have not been analyzed thoroughly in these studies . also , a detailed analysis of the stability of these structures have not been provided .    to shed light on these issues , we consider a si@xmath12 cluster whose atoms occupy complete shells of a regular bulk tetrahedral network so that the cluster not only possesses local tetrahedral bonding configuration but also an overall symmetry .",
    "the reason for choosing a small - sized cluster is that it is more convenient to analyze its properties in terms of hydrogen passivation while the underlying physics concerning hydrogen passivation is basically the same regardless of the size of the system . in the following",
    ", we will investigate the role played by hydrogen passivation in eliminating the dangling bonds and stabilizing the system for both unrelaxed and relaxed clusters . in considering relaxed clusters",
    ", we will make further distinction between the case when the silicon cluster is first passivated and then relaxed and the one in which the cluster is first relaxed and then passivated .",
    "we start by calculating the electronic dos of the _ unrelaxed _ si@xmath12 cluster whose structure is identical to the bulk structure , including the bond length ( as determined by menon and subbaswamy s notb hamiltonian@xcite ) . for the unrelaxed si@xmath12 cluster , each of the 41 interior atoms has 4 bonds both by the simple distance criterion as well as by the bond charge criterion @xcite while the remaining 42 exterior atoms have in total 108 dangling bonds .",
    "clearly , si@xmath12 with 108 dangling bonds is not a stable structure .",
    "the dos for this structure is meant only to serve as a benchmark for comparisons with other cases .",
    "the result of this calculation together with the density of states corresponding to the cases of unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 and relaxed si@xmath12 h@xmath13 clusters , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "the unrelaxed structure of si@xmath12h@xmath13 is obtained by attaching a hydrogen atom for each dangling bond along the tetrahedral bonding direction . for the hydrogen",
    "passivated si clusters , we fitted the notb hamiltonian for si - h bonding with respect to the bond length and the molecular orbital energy of sih@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the dos plots in this and subsequent figures are always displayed with the energy of homo for each case set to zero .",
    "a cursory examination of the dos plots shown in fig.3 reveals the following points : ( 1 ) there is a well - defined and substantial clean gap for the dos corresponding to the unrelaxed ( unstable ) si@xmath12 cluster .",
    "but this gap does not begin at the energy of homo ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "there are two prominent peaks at the two extremities of the gap .",
    "the first peak is immediately above the homo ( e=0 ) while the second peak is above the gap . comparing the appearance of a well - defined gap in the dos of this unrelaxed si@xmath12 with no gap for relaxed clusters discussed in section ii , one can easily associate the existence of a clean gap either with the local bonding configuration and/or the overall symmetry of the cluster .",
    "( 2 ) with the passivation of the 108 dangling bonds associated with the exterior atoms , the gap of the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 cluster `` opens '' up substantially with respect to the gap of the unrelaxed si@xmath12 .",
    "this gap now begins at the energy of homo .",
    "a comparison of these two density of states leads to an impression that the `` opening '' of the gap in si@xmath12h@xmath13 has resulted from the elimination of the two broad peaks in the dos of the unrelaxed si@xmath12 , one immediately above the energy of homo of si@xmath12 and the other across the gap from the first peak . since there is no distortion in the bonding configurations of the exterior atoms in the unrelaxed si@xmath12 , the defect states are entirely due to the 108 dangling bonds .",
    "one can then conclude that the opening - up of the gap is due to the saturation of the dangling bonds by hydrogen passivation .",
    "furthermore , one might even be tempted to attribute the two broad peaks as associated with the dangling bond states .",
    "( 3 ) after we relaxed the hydrogen passivated si@xmath12h@xmath13 cluster , we find that there is hardly any change in the major part of the gap region of the relaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 as compared to that of the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 , with only a slight narrowing of the gap due to a small downward shift of the energy of lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) .",
    "the main features of the density of states of the two cases ( unrelaxed and relaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 ) are also very similar .",
    "there is , however , some modification in the interior of the bands with the appearance of features which can be identified with si - h bonding ( see the discussion following figs . 7 and 8 ,",
    "respectively ) .    to build a complete understanding of the effects of passivation ,",
    "we have carried out a local analysis of the electronic structure of the unrelaxed si@xmath12 as well as the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 clusters . in the framework of a notb approach , the electronic structure",
    "is determined by solving a general eigenvalue problem @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the column vector representing the coefficients of expansion of the wave function @xmath18 with the eigenenergy @xmath19 in terms of some localized basis set @xmath20 not explicitly stated . here",
    "@xmath21 refers to the atomic site and @xmath22 the orbitals at site @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath23 and the overlapping matrix elements @xmath24 are defined as @xmath25 @xmath26 but in the semi - empirical notb approach , these matrix elements are treated as parameterized functions of @xmath27 with the relevant parameters fitted to experimental results and/or first principles calculations .",
    "the details of the notb formulation can be found in @xcite .    within the framework of the notb treatment , the electronic dos can be expressed as @xcite @xmath28 equation ( 4 ) allows one to rewrite the dos in terms of the local dos ( ldos ) @xmath29 such that @xmath30 with @xmath31    the notb hamiltonian used in this study was developed in a @xmath32 framework .",
    "for the unrelaxed si@xmath12 cluster , there are then 83x4=332 possible states . subtracting the 108 dangling bond states",
    ", there are 224 states with half of them ( 112 ) being the bonding states and the other half anti - bonding states . in the meantime , there are 332 valence electrons in si@xmath12 and they occupy the lowest 166 states",
    ". out of these 166 states , 112 are the bonding states .",
    "this means that the remaining 166 - 112=54 states must come from the 108 dangling bond states , leaving the other 54 dangling bond states unoccupied . to understand the characteristics of these states ,",
    "we define a quantity @xmath33 where @xmath34= @xmath35 and @xmath36=@xmath37 .",
    "this quantity is the local contributions to the integrated dos for the eigenstates in the energy interval @xmath38,@xmath39 $ ] .",
    "hence this quantity will be referred as the partially integrated ldos ( pildos ) . when pildos is plotted against the site index @xmath21",
    ", it provides a transparent picture as to whether states in a certain energy interval are extended through out the cluster or only restricted in a certain region of the cluster .",
    "( in this work , atoms are labeled from inside to outside . ) in fig.4 , @xmath40 for the following energy intervals are shown , namely @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath40 for the first 112 states , @xmath44 @xmath41 is almost uniformly distributed through out the 83 sites of the unrelaxed si@xmath12 cluster .",
    "hence the first 112 states must be the 112 extended bonding states .",
    "the @xmath40 corresponding to the next 54 states , @xmath42 is mostly concentrated in the region of the 42 exterior sites , indicating that these 54 states ( 113 to 166 ) must be the occupied dangling bond states .",
    "the @xmath40 for the 54 states from 167 to 220 is almost entirely localized in the `` surface '' region of the 42 exterior sites .",
    "hence these 54 states must correspond to the 54 unoccupied dangling bond states . in fig.5 , the @xmath40 s for the 54 states from 221 to 274",
    "are shown in the interval of every 18 states , namely , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "it can be seen that these @xmath40 s are distributed through out the 83 sites of the cluster , indicating that these 54 states must be the extended anti - bonding states .",
    "thus the first broad peak in the dos of the unrelaxed si@xmath12 just above the energy of homo ( seen in fig.3 ) which covers the energy range from @xmath48 to @xmath49 is indeed composed of the dangling bond states ( unoccupied ) while the second broad peak above the gap , covering the energy range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , is composed entirely of extended anti - bonding states .    for the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 where the 108 dangling bonds of si@xmath12 are saturated by the 108 hydrogen atoms , there are all together 83x4 + 108x1=440 states with the 220 lowest states being the bonding states and the remaining 220 states anti - bonding states .",
    "there are also 440 electrons in this cluster . hence the 220 bonding states are completely occupied while the 220 anti - bonding states are unoccupied .",
    "the bonding and anti - bonding states are separated by a wide band gap .",
    "the picture presented above can be understood in terms of the @xmath40 s for the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 shown in fig.6 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are plotted .",
    "it can be seen that both @xmath40 s are distributed uniformly through out the 83 si sites of the cluster with only very minor contributions from the outer 108 hydrogen sites , indicating that ( i ) these states are extended throughout the si cluster , and ( ii ) the widening of the gap is due to elimination of the localized dangling bond states . in figs.7 and 8 ,",
    "the ldos s at two typical hydrogen sites corresponding to the elimination of two dangling bonds of a si atom and those at three typical hydrogen sites corresponding to elimination of three dangling bonds of a si atom are shown respectively .",
    "it can be seen that there is absolutely no contribution from the hydrogen site to the band edge states of the dos of the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 cluster .",
    "the combined picture of figs .",
    "6 , 7 , and 8 shows convincingly that the existence of the clean band gap in the dos of the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 is entirely due to the si atoms in the cluster with no contribution from the surface chemistry of si - h bonding .",
    "in other words , the role of hydrogen is simply to eliminate the dangling bonds at the surface of si atoms .",
    "we have also carried out the relaxation of si@xmath12 cluster to obtain a stable si@xmath12 structure .",
    "the relaxation process indeed eliminated many of the 108 dangling bonds associated with the unrelaxed si@xmath12 . but",
    "this occurs at the expense of introducing severe bond distortion for the `` surface '' atoms , resulting in the appearance of bond distorted defect states in the gap ( see fig .",
    "the coexistence of the distorted bond states and the remnant dangling bond states that are not eliminated by relaxation provides the explanation why si nanoparticles deposited onto a film and aged in vacuum show no photoluminescence @xcite .",
    "the relaxed stable si@xmath12 structure ( si@xmath54 ) has only 22 dangling bonds .",
    "we then saturated these 22 dangling bonds by hydrogen and relaxed the si@xmath54h@xmath55 configuration . in fig.9 , the density of states corresponding to unrelaxed si@xmath12 , relaxed si@xmath12 , and",
    "relaxed si@xmath54h@xmath55 clusters are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the relaxation of si@xmath12 eliminated the majority of the dangling bonds and the passivation by hydrogen after the relaxation further reduced the remaining dangling bonds .",
    "but the distorted bonding configurations resulting from the `` surface '' reconstruction are mostly still present even for relaxed si@xmath54 h@xmath55 .",
    "hence hydrogen passivation of relaxed cluster is not expected to yield the best clean gap .",
    "finally , in table i , we listed the comparison of the total energy for all the cases considered .",
    "it can be seen that the relaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 has the lowest energy ( -5429ev ) while the unrelaxed si@xmath12h@xmath13 has almost the same energy ( -5419ev ) .",
    "the two structures are also very similar , indicating that hydrogen passivation before the cluster has the time to relax is the best way to fabricate stable clusters with a clean gap .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , it is very difficult to control experimentally the number of atoms in a cluster .",
    "this simply means that , in the fabrication process , there is no way to be certain that the cluster will have exactly the desired number of atoms to complete the shell of , say , a tetrahedral network .",
    "the question must then be raised as to whether a stable hydrogen - passivated cluster possessing a clean gap can be fabricated . to shed light on this situation",
    ", we have considered the hydrogen passivation of the unrelaxed cluster si@xmath56 .",
    "the unrelaxed si@xmath56 cluster is constructed in the following way : the si atoms are placed on the regular tetrahedral sites .",
    "but on the last incomplete shell , the si atoms are distributed on the tetrahedral site in a random manner .",
    "hence a cluster constructed in this way will have undistorted local bonding configuration but not an overall symmetry . for the particular cluster",
    "considered , there are 158 dangling bonds associated with this unrelaxed configuration .",
    "we passivate these dangling bonds with hydrogen atoms and calculate the dos of both unrelaxed si@xmath56h@xmath57 and relaxed si@xmath56h@xmath57 clusters . in fig . 10 , the density of states for the unrelaxed si@xmath56 , unrelaxed si@xmath56h@xmath57 and relaxed si@xmath56h@xmath57 are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the unrelaxed si@xmath56 cluster , as in the case of a cluster with filled shells ( eg .",
    "si@xmath12 ) , possesses a clean gap and the lower edge of this gap does not begin at homo .",
    "the unrelaxed but hydrogen passivated si@xmath56h@xmath57 has a much wider gap than that of the unrelaxed si@xmath56 and this gap begins at homo . finally , there is hardly any change in the width of the gap between the relaxed and unrelaxed si@xmath56h@xmath57 clusters .",
    "we find that results for a cluster with an incomplete shell are analogous to those for a cluster with filled shells ( eg .",
    "si@xmath12 ) the fact that the unrelaxed si@xmath56 possesses a clean gap indicates that the existence of the gap only depends on the local bonding configuration rather than the overall symmetry .",
    "the findings shown in fig.10 indicate that one may produce a cluster with a well - defined clean gap by passivating an unrelaxed cluster with hydrogen regardless of the size of the cluster ( i.e. number of atoms in the cluster ) .",
    "but , the passivation must be completed before the cluster has the time or the opportunity to relax .",
    "detailed information on the time scales in the above - mentioned process requires a study of the kinetics of hydrogen passivation . in the absence of such detailed calculations ,",
    "one can gather evidences from experiments and make some general remarks .",
    "it is known that hydrogen passivation of si(100 ) surface at 295 k leads to the formation of 1x1 surface @xcite .",
    "carrying over this analogy to the cluster case , one may speculate that it should be possible to hydrogen passivate an unrelaxed silicon cluster around room temperature .",
    "in this section , we study the size dependence of the energy gap for relaxed , hydrogen - passivated si clusters of arbitrary sizes with no bond distortion .",
    "relaxation ensures that the cluster is in a stable equilibrium configuration .",
    "since there is no longer an overall symmetry associated with such a general cluster , no symmetry - based consideration can be used to reduce the computing effort of solving the eigenvalue problem and/or determining the dos ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for such a general cluster with a size beyond 1000 atoms ,",
    "the calculation of dos becomes computationally excessive .",
    "while the method of real space green s function ( rsgf ) is efficient and convenient to calculate the dos for large systems with no or reduced symmetry @xcite , it is not a convenient tool to determine the energy gap , particularly if one wants to achieve good accuracy for the gap .",
    "this is because an accurate determination of the gap requires an accurate calculation of the energies of both the homo as well as the lumo . to do this with the method of rsgf",
    ", one has to calculate @xmath58 in the regions of the band edges at an energy interval sufficiently small compared to @xmath59 , the average separation between consecutive eigenvalues .",
    "in addition , one has to calculate these quantities for a series of decreasing @xmath60 ( smaller than @xmath59 ) to assure the convergence of the result . the whole process , while doable , can be time consuming .",
    "therefore , we have developed a scheme , as described in the appendix i , that directly computes the eigenvalues corresponding to homo and lumo without having to obtain the entire eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "this method is ideally suited for situations where selected eigenvalues of a large matrix are required .    using the method outlined in the appendix ,",
    "we have carried out a series of very accurate calculation of the energy gap for relaxed , hydrogen - passivated @xmath61 clusters of various sizes with no bond distortion . in particular , we have performed the energy gap calculation for the following sets of n ( number of si atoms ) and m ( number of h atoms ) , respectively : @xmath62 = ( 200,158),(800,372),(1400,518 ) , ( 2000,636),(3000,828),(4000,1012 ) , ( 5000,1276 ) , and ( 6000,1354 ) . denoting",
    "the energy gap of a cluster of diameter @xmath63 ( in  , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath64 and that of the bulk as @xmath65 ( both in ev ) , we have shown in fig .",
    "11 , the log - log plot of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "we find that the energy gap as a function of diameter of the cluster can be fitted to an equation of the form    @xmath68    we compare this equation with the equation for the size dependence of the energy gap of hydrogen - passivated silicon clusters with complete shells as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely ,    @xmath69    since the energy gap of bulk si obtained with the notb hamiltonian @xcite used in this calculation has a value @xmath70 , one can rewrite eq .",
    "( 9 ) to yield    @xmath71    the comparison of eqs.(8 ) and ( 10 ) indicates that for the relaxed , hydrogen - passivated si nano - cluster of arbitrary size and with no bond distortions , the size - dependence of its energy gap follows almost an identical pattern as that for the hydrogen - passivated clusters with full symmetry and no bond distortions .",
    "we have identified the factors responsible for the stability and the origin of a clean energy gap of a silicon nanocluster .",
    "we find that the existence of local configurations with no bond distortion is the key to the emergence of an energy gap .",
    "this is demonstrated by considering unrelaxed clusters with no bond distortion for which an energy gap exists no matter whether we consider a cluster with full shell ( i.e. overall symmetry ) or a cluster with an incomplete shell .",
    "however , the energy gap of unrelaxed clusters does not start at homo .",
    "this is due to the presence of dangling bond states .",
    "we have shown that the localized dangling bond states are completely eliminated by hydrogen passivation , resulting in a wider and clean energy gap .",
    "although the relaxation process can also eliminate dangling bond states , we find that this process introduces impurity states in the gap associated with the bond distortion of surface atoms in the cluster .",
    "these impurity modes can not be eliminated by further saturation of remnant dangling bonds with hydrogen . in conclusion",
    ", we find that the relaxed hydrogen - passivated silicon nanoclusters with no bond distortions have the cleanest energy gap and the most stable structure among the different cases studied in this paper .",
    "starting from a generalized eigenvalue equation given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it can be shown easily that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the ( generalized ) green s function defined by @xmath74 to determine a particular eigenvalue @xmath75 of the matrix , we start with an arbitrary vector @xmath76 and then generate a series of vectors @xmath77 iteratively according to the equation @xmath78 by writing @xmath76 as a linear combination of eigenvectors @xmath79 , namely , @xmath80 it can be seen that @xmath81 by choosing the value of @xmath82 to lie close to @xmath75 , a particular eigenvalue among all the eigenvalues of the matrix , it is possible to determine the value of @xmath75 as accurately as one desires using the formula @xmath83    in principle , this method can be used to calculate any particular eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector for large systems if we take advantage of the real space green s function ( rsgf)@xcite method for calculating @xmath73 .",
    "however , the procedure as outlined in eqs.(a3 ) and ( a6 ) requires the repeated multiplication of the matrix @xmath73 on a vector .",
    "since @xmath73 is not a sparse matrix even when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are sparse matrices , the computational effort and computing resources needed for calculating the series of @xmath77 can become excessive when the system size under consideration is very large and the computing resources are limited to desktop workstations .",
    "therefore , we have developed an alternative scheme which takes advantage of the sparseness of the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this scheme",
    ", we avoid the step involving the calculation of the green s function .",
    "we invert the expression given in eq .",
    "( a3 ) such that we can now determine @xmath77 from @xmath84 by solving the equation @xmath85",
    "using the conjugate gradient method as outlined in ref.@xcite . once consecutive @xmath77 s are determined , they can be substituted into eq.(a6 ) to determine @xmath75 .            the main computational burden in calculating the @xmath77 and hence the eigenvalue as given by eq .",
    "( a6 ) is now shifted to the calculation @xmath103 , which involves the multiplication of a matrix and a vector .",
    "however , this matrix is sparse because both @xmath24 and @xmath23 for most systems of interest are sparse in the real - space representation . because of this reason , the computational effort in evaluating specific eigenvalues becomes quite tractable even when the dimension of the system matrix is large . in the present work ,",
    "the largest matrix that we have considered has the dimension 25354x25354 and the computation was done on a hp j-282 ( 180 mhz ) with 256 mb ram .",

    "<S> we present a critical theoretical study of electronic properties of silicon nanoclusters , in particular the roles played by symmetry , relaxation , and hydrogen passivation on the the stability , the gap states and the energy gap of the system using the order - n [ o(n ) ] non - orthogonal tight - binding molecular dynamics and the local analysis of electronic structure . </S>",
