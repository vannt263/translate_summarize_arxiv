    "the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) ( @xcite ) is an imaging gas scintillation proportional counter on - board the italian - dutch  x - ray astronomy mission .",
    "( @xcite ) was launched into a 600  km 39 inclination orbit on 1996 april 30 .",
    "the lecs is one of four co - aligned narrow field instruments ( nfis ) .",
    "the other nfis are the imaging medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ; 1.310  kev ; @xcite ) , the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ; 5120  kev ; @xcite ) and the phoswich detection system ( pds ; 15300  kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the payload includes two wide field cameras ( wfc ; 230  kev ; @xcite ) which observe in directions perpendicular to the nfi .",
    "the mecs background is discussed in @xcite .",
    "accurate background subtraction is important for virtually all x - ray observations and especially for studies of extended and diffuse objects . in this _ paper _ we discuss background subtraction techniques appropriate to the lecs . background subtraction is complicated in the lecs because ( 1 ) the wings of the mirror point spread function distribute a significant fraction of hard x - rays over the entire field of view ( fov ) , ( 2 ) the broad detector response spreads a fraction of low - energy x - rays over the entire fov , ( 3 ) the off - axis response of the mirrors is complicated and single scattered x - rays from outside the direct fov can reach the focal plane ( @xcite ) , and ( 4 ) at low - energies the x - ray sky has a great deal of spatial structure ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this spatial structure has a complex energy dependence .",
    "below 0.28  kev there is a galactic plane - to - pole variation of a factor @xmath113 , while at energies between 0.5 and 2.0  kev the north polar spur and the galactic bulge dominate . for energies @xmath00.5  kev and @xmath12",
    "the x - ray sky is relatively smooth with few discrete features visible .",
    "the method of operation of the lecs is similar to that of conventional gas scintillation proportional counters . an x - ray that passes through the ultra - thin ( 1.25  @xmath13 m ) entrance window and is absorbed in the 11.4  cm diameter xe filled gas cell",
    "liberates a cloud of electrons .",
    "a uniform electric field between the entrance window , kept at @xmath1420  kv , and a grounded grid causes scintillation as the electrons travel towards the grid .",
    "the uv light from these scintillations is detected by a multi - anode photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "the lecs is also sensitive to cosmic rays since these can ionize the counter gas and leave tracks through the cell .",
    "the 2  cm diameter gas cell entrance window is supported by a tungsten strongback and fine grid .",
    "the strongback consists of a square grid of tungsten bars with a separation of 4 .",
    "each strongback square is further divided into 8 by 8 pixels by a fine grid .",
    "the overall effect of the strongback and fine grid is to reduce the x - ray transmission by between 2040% , depending on position within the fov .",
    "the lecs includes two @xmath15fe radioactive sources which constantly illuminate regions of the detector outside the sky fov to provide monitoring of the instrument performance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "the lecs mirror system consists of 30 nested , au coated mirrors with a double cone approximation to the wolter  i geometry .",
    "the mirror focal length is 185  cm and the geometric area 124  @xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the off - axis behavior of the mirrors is complicated .",
    "conti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) demonstrate that x - rays within a cone of solid angle 2@xmath17 can reach the focal plane after reflection off only one of the mirror surfaces . as part of the  science verification phase ,",
    "observations were performed with the crab nebula just outside the lecs fov .",
    "these show that at an offset of 60 , the crab nebula is visible as an extended emission region offset in the direction of the source , with an intensity @xmath18 of that on - axis .",
    "the spectrum of the offset emission ( a power - law with a photon index , @xmath19 , of @xmath20 ) is consistent with that recorded from the crab nebula on - axis ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the lecs is only operated during satellite night time . although this reduces the observing efficiency considerably , it means that that any contribution to the background from scattered solar x - rays , e.g. , as seen by the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) when the sun - earth - satellite angle is @xmath3120@xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is negligible .",
    "the  observing schedule is designed to optimize the lecs observing efficiency .",
    "this means that , in general , only time constrained or target of opportunity observations include long intervals of dark earth pointing .",
    "the lecs is not operated when the satellite passes close to the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) . due to the low  orbital inclination saa passages result in between 5 and 12  min of data",
    "being lost per 96  min satellite orbit . in order to maximize the observing efficiency ,",
    "many  nfi observations are made with a sun - satellite - target angle close to 120@xmath17 , which is as far from the solar direction as it is possible to operate .",
    "the lecs energy resolution is 32% full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) at 0.28  kev and 8.8% fwhm at 6  kev .",
    "the fov is circular with a diameter of 37 .",
    "the position resolution corresponds to 90% encircled energy within a radius of 25 at 1.5  kev .",
    "this is a factor @xmath114 worse than that of the pspc and comparable to that of the asca gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) .",
    "[ fig : plot_effic3 ] shows the on - axis lecs effective area .",
    "a key scientific goal of the lecs is to study sources in the energy band below the instrument s c edge at 0.28  kev .",
    "this typically means that the absorption to a source must be @xmath22@xmath23  .",
    "the prime advantage of the lecs , compared to previous high throughput x - ray detectors , is its good low - energy spectral resolution and its low background afforded by the imaging characteristics .",
    "the 0.12.0  kev energy resolution is a factor @xmath112.4 better that that of the pspc , while the effective area is between a factor @xmath1120 and 5 lower at 0.28  kev and 1.5  kev , respectively .",
    "the energy resolution is similar to that of the gis in the overlapping energy range , and comparable to that of the asca solid - state imaging spectrometer at energies of @xmath110.5  kev .",
    "in order to study the properties of the lecs background , data were extracted from 350  final observation tapes , corresponding to 170 individual observations .",
    "these data were processed using the standard lecs processing pipeline described below and cleaned event lists for the intervals when the instrument was observing both the dark earth and the sky in the nominal operating configuration extracted .",
    "observations with @xmath3100 counts were excluded .",
    "this left total sky and dark earth exposures of 2847  ks and 498.6  ks , respectively .    table  [ tab : telemetry ] gives the contents of the lecs telemetry for each detected event .",

    "removal of background events using the veto and bl signals .",
    "the veto signal is the ratio between the light measured by the central pmt anode and the sum of that measured by the surrounding anodes .",
    "it therefore has a high value for on - axis x - ray sources and lower values for events occurring further off - axis . in saxledas 1.8.0 a sliding cell veto window",
    "is applied to the data .",

    "it depends on the penetration depth of an event into the cell , which is energy dependent . in saxledas 1.8.0 events",
    "are selected if their pi and bl values are within a set of 62 pre - defined boxes .",

    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) from the source centroid using the cleaned event lists produced by saxledas .",
