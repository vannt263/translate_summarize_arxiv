    "the concept of time operator in quantum mechanics is a difficult and confusing one@xcite .",
    "heisenberg formulated the time - energy uncertainity principle already in the early days of quantum theory , indicating through analogy with the position - momentum uncertainty principle , that some time operator should exist .",
    "however , shortly after this , pauli argued that no such self - adjoint operator can exist  @xcite .",
    "further development in scattering theory pursued the search for an estimates of time - scales associated with quantum processes , establishing the phase time , the time delay seen in the motion of the maximum of a wavepacket as the relevant quantity  @xcite .",
    "this , however , turned out to be unsatisfactory due to inherent ambiguity in the preparation of the wavepackets or identification of its maxima or other features . several imaginative approaches , like the so called larmor - clock time  @xcite or the traversal time  @xcite",
    "were suggested to identify the relevant time - scales .",
    "however , no final formulation of the problem has been established nor a consensus has been reached if such a formalism should exist . nonetheless , the time - scale related to tunneling is an extremely useful concept for relevance of many - body effects in electronic transport through nanostructures .",
    "this has been analyzed in the pioneering work by jonson  @xcite where the time scale of tunneling was determined by the time scale of formation of the image charge , causing alteration of the effective tunneling barrier  @xcite .",
    "more generally , our ability to characterize the time - scales of transit or tunneling of an electron through a nanocontacts would be extremely helpful in understanding the importance of interactions in ab initio description of quantum transport  @xcite .    independently of these physically motivated treatments , a important step forward in understanding the time operator , not as a self - adjoint operator but rather as a positively valued operator measure , has been done by holevo  @xcite .",
    "independently , kijowski  @xcite heuristically constructed a distribution of a time - of - arrival for a quantum particle .",
    "his work was later developed into the formulation of the construction of probability distribution of the arrival time@xcite .",
    "most recently , even the problem of non self - adjointness of the time operator for a free quantum particle has been addressed by galapon  @xcite by introducing the confined time of arrival operator ( ctao ) within finite space using specific boundary conditions in the real space .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose an alternative formalism , the use of periodic boundary conditions in the energy representation that leads to a family of self - adjoint time operators .",
    "in contrast to the ctao , arbitrary scattering potentials can be considered from the start and the related issue of normalization of the probability distribution for times  @xcite is also resolved .",
    "the boundary conditions in the energy representation lead to formal quantization of the time , similarly to the situation with the ctao .",
    "the quantization of time is a useful mathematical tool for drawing a simple physical picture of the time - dynamics of the quantum particle within the orthogonal time - eigenstate basis .",
    "this is used for physical interpretation of the zero - time eigenstate and its relation to the conventional arrival - time operator  @xcite and the time - of - presence operator  @xcite .",
    "however , within the energy representation , the formalism is similar to many previous uses of the time - operators in the form of diferentiation by energy  @xcite .",
    "our formalism is demonstrated on a simple example of scattering of a particle on a resonant potential in 1d .",
    "in our work we will consider a quantum particle moving along x axis , characterized by its hamiltonian @xmath0 assumed to have continuous spectrum , occupying a state @xmath1 .",
    "for this particle we introduce a family of time operators , @xmath2 , where each of them gives the time it took for the particle to arrive into the state @xmath1 , assuming its dynamics has been governed by @xmath0 .",
    "the concept of the time operator also demands a definition of the zero of the time for certain state , which will be discussed after the operator is introduced .",
    "different zero - time states are in one - to - one correspondence to different members of the family of time operators . for the state @xmath1 , we will assume that it can be expressed as a linear combination of the hamiltonian eigenstates , @xmath3 , with energies from a finite interval , the _ energy band _ @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the quantum number for degenerate states at the energy @xmath7 .",
    "this degeneracy arises from some other operator @xmath8 ( or possibly several operators ) that commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates are chosen so as to be common eigenstates of both @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "the complex amplitude @xmath9 represents the state @xmath1 in the _ energy - band representation_. the eigenstates are normalized to the delta function of energy , and the amplitude is normalized to one .",
    "this representation is not unique , another one can be obtained choosing a different operator @xmath10 that also commutes with @xmath0 ( but not with @xmath8 ) .",
    "the representations are then related through an energy - dependent unitary transformation @xmath11    we will assume that the amplitude for the state @xmath1 has a support within the considered energy band so that at the ends of the interval we have @xmath12 .",
    "the states @xmath9 form a subspace of the hilbert space @xmath13 of all square - integrable states @xmath14 that are _ periodic _ within the energy band . extending the width of the energy band , or considering a union of all energy bands covering the continuous spectrum of the hamiltonian , and adding its possible bound states forms a complete set of states  @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of introducing the time operators for state @xmath1 it is sufficient to consider single energy band .",
    "we will demonstrate that in the energy - band representation , within @xmath13 , the self - adjoint time operator can be defined as . ]",
    "@xmath15 apart from the so - far unspecified hermitian , energy - dependent matrix @xmath16 , and the fact that we define it only within the energy band , this operator has been known for long time as the operator for time in the energy - representation .",
    "it is well known that it is not self - adjoint if the whole spectrum is considered  @xcite and not unique by the freedom of choice in the energy representation  @xcite .",
    "the former is removed by the finite energy interval and the periodic boundary conditions employed . on the other hand , the freedom of choice of the energy representation in eq .",
    "[ eq - def-1 ] is related to the choice of the hermitian matrix @xmath16 in the definition in eq .",
    "[ eq - def-2 ] . using the unitary transformation , introduced in eq .",
    "[ eq - u ] , @xmath17 we find a transformed time operator @xmath18 hence , starting from a particular energy - representation and a particular choice of @xmath16 , we can find a representation where the time operator is represented by the energy derivative only . this latter representation , if we had some rationale for choosing it independently of the time operator , could serve as the basis for definition of the time operator without any ambiguities .",
    "the first step along this line is to demand that the time operator should commute with chosen operator(s ) @xmath8 .",
    "examples of these could be the linear or angular momentum , spin , _ etc .",
    "_ one of these is also the projector to the right- and left- going scattering states leading to @xmath19 or @xmath20 in 1d scattering that will be used in the next section .",
    "this reduces the matrix @xmath16 into diagonal form and specifies the time operator for a processes which conserve the particular quantum number @xmath6 . for the simplicity of notation",
    ", we will not indicate this fact with any additional index for the time operator @xmath2 .",
    "further specification of @xmath2 is related to the choice of zero time state , as discussed below , but in general no unique definition of the time operator will be given .",
    "instead , we will accept that we deal with a family of operators of the form given by eq .",
    "[ eq - def-2 ] with @xmath21 and that for a specific calculations we need to choose one particular form .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the time operator are @xmath22 where @xmath23 are _ discreet _ eigenvalues of the time operator .",
    "similarly to our finding , discreet eigenvalues were found in the construction of the confined time operator  @xcite for a free quantum particle . in both cases ,",
    "the quantization is nothing fundamental and arises only as a result of the choice of the energy band : the size of the time - quanta could be changed by simply changing the width of the energy band while the final average values of the time operator will remain independent of this choice , which becomes obvious when using the energy representation .",
    "still , choosing a wider energy band , i.e. decreasing the quantum of time , is desirable if one is interested in finer details of the probability distribution in time variable .",
    "rewriting the time eigenstates from the energy - band representation into the abstract form we have @xmath24 this set of states is subspace of the stroboscopic wavepacket basis , recently introduced for the description of open non - equilibrium electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "here we see that it naturally arises as the set of eigenstates of the time operator defined on the chosen interval of energies .    the eigenstates with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , have eigenvalue of the time operator zero , i.e. this is the choice of the zero of time . due to the unspecified phase @xmath27",
    "there is a certain freedom in the choice of this zero time eigenstate ( and hence a particular time operator ) .",
    "if a particle is in one of these states , it took zero time to arrive into it .",
    "on the other hand , for a state @xmath28 it took it precisely the time @xmath29 for the particle to arrive there from @xmath30 , since from eq .",
    "[ eq - tau - state - in - energy ] we find @xmath31 finally , for a particle in an arbitrary state within the energy band , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 will be the probability for the particle to arrive into it in time @xmath34 .    from the above",
    "it follows that the expectation value of the time @xmath35 in the state @xmath1 is given by weighting the different time eigenvalues with the probabilities that the relevant eigenstate is present in the state @xmath1 , @xmath36 this is equivalent to using the form in eq .",
    "[ eq - def-2 ] within the energy - band representation , @xmath37 g_\\phi(\\epsilon,\\alpha ) .",
    "\\label{eq - time - in - e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which motivates the formal definition of the time operator by the eq .  [ eq - def-2 ]",
    "clearly , the expectation value of the time operator depends on the choice of zero - time eigenstate , i.e. on the choice of the phases @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , for the uncertainty of this average , @xmath38 we find @xmath39 which is manifestly _ independent _ of the choice of the phases @xmath27 and hence characteristic of the whole family of time operators .",
    "the whole family of time operators , eq .  [ eq - def-2 ] , fulfills the canonical commutation relation with the hamiltonian @xmath40 , @xmath41=i$ ] , if the latter is understood to act only on states @xmath1 with finite support within the energy band .",
    "( a minor technical issue that can be dealt with arises if the whole @xmath13 is considered , since there the hamiltonian is not continuous at the boundaries of the energy band . )",
    "this commutation relation then leads automatically to the uncertainty relation for the mean square fluctuations in the energy and the time , @xmath42 .",
    "the argument due to pauli  @xcite regarding the non - existence of the self - adjoint time - operator does not apply since the boundary conditions cause the energy - shift operator to move the states periodically within the band .",
    "namely , using the orthogonality of the time - operators eigenstates ( eq .  [ eq - tau - eig ] ) we can expand the hamiltonian s eigenstates @xmath43 , eq .",
    "[ eq - tau - state - in - energy ] , into the former and find the identity @xmath44",
    "e^{-i \\epsilon ' \\hat{\\tau } } { { \\left| } \\epsilon , \\alpha { \\right\\rangle } } , \\ ] ] for @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the periodic boundary conditions within the bands were not used , the above identity would not contain the modulo operation with the difference @xmath46 and the result would be that the state @xmath47 is an eigenstate of hamiltonian with the eigenvalue @xmath48 .",
    "following pauli , and in view of arbitrariness of @xmath49 , this would be in contradiction with the existence of the lower bound on the eigenenergies .",
    "however , we have shown above that the use of the periodic boundary conditions removes this problem .",
    "the here used time operator is , by its character , close to the time - of - presence mentioned in the review by muga and leavens  @xcite .",
    "however , many authors  @xcite prefer the concept of the arrival - time operator that gives the average value of time for a quantum particle to arrive at a spatial position @xmath50 if initially ( at time @xmath51 ) it was in a chosen state @xmath52 .",
    "one can easily see that such an operator is given by @xmath53 , with a specific choice of the phases @xmath27 .",
    "the latter is such that the zero - time eigenstates resembles the position eigenstate @xmath54 as much as possible .",
    "for example , for a free quantum particle the energy eigenstates are @xmath55 and using the projection @xmath56 , one finds @xmath57 .",
    "the interpretation of this time operator is as follows : we expand the state @xmath52 into the arrival - time operator eigenstates , @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath59 is the probability that the particle in @xmath52 will arrive into the @xmath26 in time @xmath60 .",
    "identifying the zero - time eigenstate with measurement device at @xmath61 gives the sought kijowski probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , we need to stress that the arrival state , i.e. the zero - time eigenstate , can be quite different from the position eigenstate @xmath54 so that it should not be interpreted literally as the probability of the time of arrival into @xmath50 exactly .",
    "at its both ends and a constant value @xmath62 in between . varying the latter gives access to various transport regimes - from resonant tunneling to opaque tunneling .",

    "we have shown that each member of the family of time operators fulfills the canonical commutation relation with the particle s hamiltonian and hence the energy - time uncertainty principle , identified its eigenstates are stroboscopic wavepackets , and showed how the present treatment avoids pauli s argument . in the context of the tunneling of a quantum particle , we have shown how a positively defined distribution function of times of arrival into an arbitrary state is obtained . using the latter we have obtained the average value of the time operator which corresponds to the phase time which , however , is specific to a particular choice of the zero - time eigenstate and hence the particular choice of the time operator .",
