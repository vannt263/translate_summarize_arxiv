    "the distinction between @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) proper and their afterglows may be one between emission from shocks internal to the relativistic outflow and an external shock with a circumsource medium ( rees and mszros 1994 ; sari and piran 1997 ; mszros and rees 1997 ) . from an observational viewpoint , the relation between the burst proper and afterglow emissions is not well understood . however , the recent identification of a simultaneous optical counterpart to grb990123 made with rotse ( akerloff et al .",
    "1999 ) has shown that in some cases emissions from internal and external shocks can overlap , in agreement with the work of sari and piran ( 1999a ) .",
    "one way to assess this relation has been the comparison of the 1 - 10 kev x - ray emission during the burst with that observed in the afterglow .",
    "backward extrapolations of the _ beppo_sax x - ray afterglow light curves to the decay part of the burst indicate that the late x - ray emission in the burst and the afterglow are consistent with a single power law decay curve indicating that the tail of the burst evolves continuously into the afterglow ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ; piro et al .",
    "1998 ; nicastro 1998 ; int zand 1998 ) .",
    "these results appear to be in contradiction with the initial disappearance of x - ray emission in grb780506 , which was followed @xmath3 s later by their reappearance , supporting the case of afterglow emission disconnected from the burst ( connors and heuter 1998 ) .",
    "elsewhere , evidence for extended hard @xmath0-ray emission has been reported for @xmath4 of the bursts detected by phebus ( tkachenko et al .",
    "osse has provided upper limits on high - energy ( @xmath5 kev ) post - burst emission from grb950421 ( matz et al .",
    "analysis of a subset of grbs dubbed `` freds '' ( fast rise exponential decay ) from early in the batse mission has shown a softening trend in the decay of the burst ( bhat et al .",
    "more recently , burenin et al . ( 1999 ) report granat / sigma observations of a soft @xmath0-ray tail lasting @xmath6 s.    we present batse observations of grb980923 , which show that after a period of @xmath1 s of strong variability , the signal abruptly enters a phase of smooth decay . during this decay phase , which lasts @xmath3 s ,",
    "the properties of the @xmath0-ray emission are very similar to those of afterglows at lower energies .",
    "our results support the idea that , in this case , the afterglow emission started during the burst , consistent with the theoretical prediction of early high - energy afterglow by sari and piran ( 1999b ) .",
    "the spectral evolution of this @xmath0-ray afterglow indicates that it is the early , high - energy part of subsequent x - ray and optical afterglow .",
    "on 1998 september 23 at 20:10:47.5 ut batse was triggered on the 64 ms time scale by a long and intense grb ( trigger 7113 ) , shown in figure 1 .",
    "the burst was not in the field of view of the _ beppo_sax wfc .",
    "rxte / pca made a single observation in stare mode in response to the batse rapid burst response ( kippen et al .",
    "1997 ) system , but observed no change in count rate .",
    "a full scan of the grb error circle by rxte / pca was not possible at the time .",
    "the event consists of complex variability lasting @xmath7 40 s , followed by a smooth emission tail .",
    "the 50 - 300 kev peak flux of the burst on the 64 ms time scale is @xmath8 ergs sec@xmath9 @xmath10 , ranking twelfth in brightness among all batse grbs .",
    "the fluence of the burst ( @xmath11 kev ) is @xmath12 ergs @xmath10 , ranking third among all batse grbs .",
    "the fluence in the tail ( @xmath13 s ) is @xmath14 of the total burst fluence .",
    "typically grbs are short enough that prior and post background intervals can be chosen so that the behavior of the background during the burst emission interval can be estimated through interpolation . in the case of grb980923 , however , the duration of the emission tail is unknown , therefore routine background subtraction is not applicable .",
    "we use as background the average of the count rates registered when the spacecraft ( cgro ) is positioned at the point closest in geomagnetic latitude to that at the time of the burst on days before and after the burst trigger , as described in connaughton et al .",
    "background rates were computed using both cont ( 16 channel , 2.048 s time resolution ) and discla ( 4 channel , 1.024 s time resolution ) data types for comparison .",
    "the two detectors which have the highest burst count rates also have the smallest source angles to vela x-1 .",
    "the vela pulsations were modeled using a 7 term harmonic fourier expansion centered on a barycentric frequency equal to 3.546 mhz , as tabulated from batse pulsar monitoring ( m. finger , private communication ) .",
    "the model was fit to the background subtracted discla data in channel 1 ( 25 - 50 kev ) during a pre - burst interval ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 s and a post - burst interval from 300 to 1000 s , having a @xmath17/dof of 1.12 ( 1067 dof ) .",
    "fourier spectra of the residual rates in the fitting intervals are consistent with that expected from poisson fluctuations .",
    "we also modeled the pulsations in the cont data ( used for spectral modeling ) using the same procedure and time intervals .",
    "fits were made in each channel for channel 1 through 10 with an average reduced @xmath17 equal to 0.95 .",
    "we modeled the tail count rates with a power law ( pl ) of the form @xmath18 .",
    "separate fits were made in five energy ranges ( 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , 25 - 300 , and @xmath5 kev ) using the discla count rate data from 40 to 298 s after the trigger time . for comparison , fits were also made using cont data , binned in energy to match the discla channel boundaries .",
    "a series of fits were made in each energy range for @xmath19 $ ] at 1.024 s intervals using a @xmath17 minimization algorithm with two free parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while the value of @xmath22 was held constant for each fit . from the fits in",
    "the energy ranges below 300 kev , we find best - fit ( i.e. , minimum @xmath17 ) values for @xmath21 in the range @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( with typical uncertainties @xmath25 ) for @xmath22 in the range 9.6 - 12.1 s. for the high - energy ( @xmath5 kev ) emission we find @xmath26 for @xmath27 s ( @xmath17/dof = 0.2 ) . the @xmath28 confidence intervals in @xmath22 range from @xmath29 to @xmath30 s , and do not change much with energy .",
    "the best fit model in the 25 - 300 kev range using discla data gives @xmath31 ( @xmath17/dof = 1.22 ) for @xmath32 s ( see figure 2 ) . both @xmath33 ( dashed ) and @xmath28 ( solid ) confidence intervals for @xmath22",
    "are shown in figure 2 with the 25 - 300 kev time history and the pl models from the range of @xmath22 values .",
    "the pl fits , and the obvious requirement that the pl emission can not exceed the total burst signal , indicate that the pl decay started @xmath34 - 25 s after the burst trigger .",
    "note that there is no reason why @xmath22 for the afterglow should be 0 , i.e. the time of trigger , since the ( internal shock ) grb emission and ( external shock ) afterglow are physically different and thus somewhat independent in timing .",
    "for the spectral modeling we used the vela - corrected cont data ( 22 - 1880 kev ) and constructed a single time - integrated spectrum for a time interval spanning 40.813 to 102.253 s in the tail . at the time of observation , the onboard lad look - up table was in soft mode , mapping low energies into higher cont channels and thus providing suitable statistics below 50 kev . to examine the spectral evolution in the tail we generated ten spectra with 8.192 s time resolution ( four 2.048-second cont bins ) from 39.789 to 121.709 s in the tail .",
    "although the tail of the burst appears to last beyond @xmath7250 s , we selected our source intervals such that the model fit parameters are reasonably constrained .",
    "the fits were made using the forward folding technique .",
    "the photon model that best represents the data was determined by comparing fits made with a single pl ( 2 free parameters ) and a smoothly broken power law ( sbpl ) ( 4 free parameters ) using the @xmath35 statistic ( band et al .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 with a chance probability of obtaining a value equal to or greater than @xmath35 of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we used the sbpl to model the spectra for grb980923 .",
    "the parameters of the sbpl are the low- and high - energy photon indices @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the break energy @xmath40 . from the time - integrated fit ,",
    "we obtain @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 kev ( @xmath44 ) . the grb function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) was also fit ( @xmath45 ) giving nearly identical parameter values ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , similar to values commonly found in grb spectra ( preece et al .",
    "however , the grb function proved to be less robust than the sbpl in the time resolved fits .",
    "from the ten fits made in the tail , we find that @xmath38 and @xmath39 do not vary significantly , with weighted average values @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . the break energy was held fixed in several of these fits to allow meaningful estimates of the photon indices .",
    "therefore , we repeated the ten fits keeping @xmath38 and @xmath39 constant at their average values , allowing only the break energy and amplitude as free parameters .",
    "@xmath40 decreases with time ( see figure 4 ) , indicating that the spectrum retains a constant shape as it shifts in time to lower energies .",
    "time resolved spectra ( 2.048 s resolution ) during the main burst emission were also modeled with a sbpl using cont data corrected for deadtime effects and vela pulsations .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of @xmath38 and @xmath39 during the main burst and the tail .",
    "an abrupt change in the spectral form is quite evident where the main burst emission drops sharply and the tail of the burst becomes detectable at @xmath1 s. the time integrated spectrum of the main burst gives grb function parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , typical for grbs ( preece et al .",
    "1999 ) .    careful inspection of figure 3 reveals a softening in the low - energy index , @xmath38 , near 14 s , where the burst intensity drops to roughly the same level as observed in the tail ( see figure 1 and 2 ) . beyond",
    "@xmath54 s @xmath38 appears to maintain slightly steeper values , suggesting an overabundance of low - energy flux that was not present ( or at least very weak ) at the time of the burst trigger , which may be attributed to the rise of the afterglow since the decay must begin @xmath34 - 25 s after the trigger time .",
    "in the external shock scenario of the relativistic fireball model , electrons are accelerated to a pl energy distribution @xmath55 by a forward shock generated when the relativistic shell encounters the surrounding medium , where @xmath56 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of a relativistic shock with a pl electron distribution can be described by four pl regions segmented according to @xmath57 in the _ fast - cooling _",
    "regime , and @xmath58 in the _ slow - cooling _ regime ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , where @xmath59 is the self - absorption frequency , @xmath60 is the cooling frequency , and @xmath61 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency . for adiabatic evolution , @xmath60 evolves as @xmath62 , while @xmath63 ( sari et al . 1996 ) . in the fast - cooling regime ,",
    "the evolution may be radiative , in which case @xmath64 . adopting the notation of sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ignoring self - absorption , the observed spectral flux in the fast - cooling regime is given by    @xmath65    similarly , the flux in the slow - cooling regime can be written as    @xmath66    three characteristics of the synchrotron spectrum allow us to distinguish between the fast- and slow - cooling regimes : 1 ) the change in spectral slope across the break frequency , 2 ) the time dependence of the break frequency , and 3 ) the relation between the temporal and spectral pl indices .    for slow - cooling",
    "we expect a change in the spectral slope across @xmath60 equal to @xmath67 ; for fast - cooling , the change across @xmath61 equals @xmath68",
    ". the value of @xmath69 can be obtained from @xmath70 , leading to @xmath71 , typical for afterglows .",
    "the expected change in slope in the fast - cooling regime then equals @xmath72 . from the time - integrated spectral fit",
    ", we find a slope change of @xmath73 ; from the time - resolved fits we obtain an average change in slope of @xmath74 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with slow - cooling , but do not exclude fast - cooling very strongly .",
    "if we are observing a cooling break then we can expect the break energy to evolve as @xmath62 ( sari et al .",
    "1996 ) for adiabatic evolution .",
    "the time - dependent break energy was modeled with a pl of the form @xmath75 in the same manner as the decay of the intensity .",
    "we find a pl index @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) for @xmath78 s ( see figure 4 ) ; slightly beyond the @xmath28 confidence interval , but within a @xmath79 interval and consistent with the pl decay starting @xmath80 s after the trigger time . to obtain a fit with @xmath81 or @xmath82 , corresponding to the two possible behaviors of @xmath83 ( namely the adiabatic and radiative cases , respectively ) ,",
    "would require @xmath22 to be negative , and is thus excluded by the data .",
    "we conclude that the break energy corresponds to the cooling frequency , i.e. the tail is in the slow - cooling regime .",
    "if we insert the time dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 into the expressions for @xmath84 and let @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the low- and high - energy pl indices of the energy spectrum , then we have @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the relationships between the temporal and spectral indices are @xmath93 for @xmath90 and @xmath94 for @xmath92 .",
    "the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the time integrated spectral fits give an expected values of @xmath95 for the low frequency light curve ( @xmath90 ) , and @xmath96 for the high frequency light curve ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "similar values are derived when the average spectral indices are used . since the pl decay must begin later than @xmath97 s after the burst trigger , we can expect the decay index to be shallower than @xmath24 . for @xmath98 s",
    "we obtain @xmath99 ( 25 - 50 kev ) , in agreement with the value computed from the spectral index and in accordance with the value of @xmath22 that gives the correct break energy pl index .",
    "although this fit does not have the lowest @xmath17 ( @xmath100 ) , it does satisfy the requirement that the pl can not exceed the total burst count rate .",
    "the same scenario holds for the high frequency light curve .",
    "our measured value @xmath101 in the high frequency regime ( @xmath5 kev ) is consistent with @xmath102 derived from the spectral index .    in the fast - cooling regime ,",
    "two cases must be considered . for adiabatic blast wave evolution",
    ", we expect @xmath103 above @xmath61 which agrees with the measured high - energy decay . however , the expected behavior below @xmath61 is @xmath104 , which strongly disagrees with the measured 25 - 50 kev pl index by at least 0.76 for all values of @xmath22 . for radiative blast waves ,",
    "the behavior above @xmath61 is @xmath105 , in agreement with the data ; however , below @xmath61 we expect @xmath106 , which also strongly disagrees with the data for all values of @xmath22 . in summary , we conclude that fast - cooling scenarios with @xmath107 do not agree with the evolution of the tail of this burst .",
    "we find similarities between the properties of grb980923 and those of grb920723 ( burenin et al .",
    "both exhibit long soft @xmath0-ray tails , however the tail of grb920723 last longer by a factor 2 and decays less steeply ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "burenin et al .",
    "report a change in spectral index equal to @xmath109 , which is strikingly similar to the abrupt change we observe in @xmath38 . from our spectral analysis",
    "we have been able to identify which blast wave evolution regime is favored in the production of the high - energy tail .",
    "these results suggest a behavior not unlike that of afterglows observed at lower energies . in particular , the evolution of the spectrum in the tail of the burst appears to mimic the evolution of a synchrotron cooling break in the slow - cooling regime .",
    "this implies that the transition from fast to slow - cooling ( i.e. , when @xmath110 ) can take place on ( short ) time scales comparable to the duration of the burst .",
    "if the synchrotron emission from external shocks is the source of the `` classical '' afterglow , then our analysis provides evidence that , at least in some bursts , the afterglow may begin during the @xmath0-ray emission phase and may reveal itself in the grb light curves .",
