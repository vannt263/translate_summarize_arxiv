    "<S> in this letter , we propose a model of inflationary cosmology with a bounce preceded and study its primordial curvature perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> our model gives rise to a primordial power spectrum with a feature of oscillation on large scales compared with the nearly scale - invariant spectrum generated by the traditional slow rolling inflation model . </S>",
    "<S> we will show this effect changes the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature power spectrum and the large scale structure ( lss ) matter power spectrum . and further with a detailed simulation we will point out this signal is detectable to the forthcoming observations , such as planck and lamost .    </S>",
    "<S> inflation , as a description of the very early universe , has successfully resolved some problems existing in hot big bang cosmology , such as flatness , horizon , monopole problem and so on @xcite . however , this scenario is puzzled by the initial singularity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one possible approach to this disaster is to introduce a bounce before the inflationary expansion , which requires the hot big bang expansion be preceded by a contracting period @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this happens , one significant question would be proposed : what does bouncing cosmology tell us for observations ? or , is it detectable for some primordial relics from contracting phase to be imprinted on observations ? to answer this question , we need to study the evolution of primordial gravitational perturbations seeded before the bounce .    in this letter , we propose a nonsingular inflationary model , and study signatures of its primordial fluctuations on cmb temperature power spectrum and lss matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find an interesting oscillation signature existing on large scales of the scale - invariant spectrum and by a detailed simulation we will show this new effect could be detected by the forthcoming astronomical observations , such as planck and lamost .    as in inflation theory , </S>",
    "<S> our model can be described in terms of scalar fields which minimally couple to the four dimensional einstein s gravity . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly it consists of two scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the lagrangian given by : @xmath2 in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . here </S>",
    "<S> the essential component is the scalar field @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it plays a crucial role in giving a bouncing solution smoothly . without it , the model in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) will be similar to the traditional inflation with a single scalar field , which as we know suffers from the problem of the initial singularity . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the potential is only the function of the field @xmath0 and of coleman - weinberg form @xcite : @xmath3 which takes its maximum value @xmath4 at @xmath5 and vanishes at the minima when @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the scalar field @xmath1 merely affects the evolution around the bounce but decays out quickly when away from it .    in order to discuss the perturbations explicitly , </S>",
    "<S> we first see how the background universe evolves . in this model </S>",
    "<S> a contracting universe can be driven to reach a minimal size during which the universe evolves like a matter - dominant one , and then a quasi - exponential expansion is following , and so is able to explain the problems appeared in standard big bang cosmology . the process to link the contraction and expansion is a smooth bounce , and the evolution of the hubble parameter </S>",
    "<S> can be treated as a linear function of the cosmic time approximately .    </S>",
    "<S> we take the initial condition for the background as that @xmath0 stays at one vacuum like @xmath7 when the universe is contracting and @xmath8 is small enough which can be ignored on background evolution . in this phase , the field @xmath0 oscillates around @xmath7 making the equation - of - state ( eos ) of the universe </S>",
    "<S> oscillate about @xmath9 , and so the average state being similar to a matter - dominated one . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have the useful expressions of background evolution @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the comoving hubble parameter and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the comoving time . </S>",
    "<S> another useful relation is given by @xmath12 which will be used to calculate the metric perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> since the universe is contracting , the amplitude of the field @xmath0 s oscillation gets larger and larger , while the contribution of the field @xmath1 grows rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> when the field reaches the plateau , the bounce happens at the moment @xmath13 . during the bounce , </S>",
    "<S> we take the parametrization @xmath14 around the bounce point @xmath15 , and the coefficient @xmath16 is a positive constant determined from numerical calculations . in the bouncing phase </S>",
    "<S> , the kinetic term of @xmath1 reaches the maximal value and from the equation of motion we deduce an expression @xmath17 when @xmath16 is not very large . </S>",
    "<S> finally we have the approximate relations @xmath18 where we have defined @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> after the bounce , as the field @xmath0 moves forward slowly along the plateau , the universe enters into an expanding phase at the moment @xmath20 and the eos of the universe is approximately @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the universe expands with its scale factor growing almost exponentially . in this phase </S>",
    "<S> , we have the well - known relations for background evolution @xmath22 finally , when the field drops into the vacuum @xmath23 , it will oscillate again and the eos of the universe will oscillate around zero as it does before the bounce . to make the scenario explicit , we give a sketch description of our model in fig.[fig : scalefactor ] and </S>",
    "<S> present the numerical calculation of the background parameters in fig.[fig : background ] .    ) . before inflation </S>",
    "<S> , there is a bounce instead of the initial singularity . ]    , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . * a plot of the evolutions of the field @xmath0 , the eos @xmath24 and the hubble parameter @xmath25 in the model of eq.([lagrangian ] ) where we take the coleman - weinberg potential . in the numerical calculation </S>",
    "<S> we choose the parameter @xmath26 , and the initial condition as : @xmath27 where @xmath28  . ]    </S>",
    "<S> now we study the linear perturbations of the model . taking the longitudinal ( conformal newtonian ) gauge , </S>",
    "<S> the metric perturbation is presented as follows : @xmath29~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the equation of motion of the gravitational potential is : @xmath30 which can be derived from the basic perturbation equations directly ( we refer the complete derivation to ref.@xcite , and see e.g. ref.@xcite for a comprehensive survey of the cosmological perturbation theory ) . as is pointed out previously , the energy density of the field @xmath1 is usually negligible far away from the bounce , and hence we have @xmath31 . near the bounce , @xmath1 becomes very important , but according to the analysis in ref.@xcite we have the approximation @xmath32 and so the perturbation of @xmath1 decouples from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eomp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will neglect the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eomp ] ) , and just focus on the adiabatic fluctuations in the following which can be determined by a single scalar field @xmath0 .     in our model . ]    </S>",
    "<S> now we follow one fourier mode of the perturbation , labelled by its comoving wave number @xmath33 , and find that there are two paths for perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of perturbations is sketched in fig.[fig4:sketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> initially all the perturbations stay inside the horizon in the far past . </S>",
    "<S> since the hubble radius shrinks , those modes with small comoving wave number exit the horizon while the large @xmath33 scales still keep inside . </S>",
    "<S> when the bounce takes place , all the perturbations will enter the horizon because at that moment the hubble radius diverges . since in our model the bounce is followed by an expanding phase , those fourier modes will escape out if the efolds for the post - bounce slow - rolling period is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> after that , these modes will re - enter the horizon at late times after the slow - rolling phase has finished . in the following calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus on large @xmath33 region and see whether the large k modes are able to perform scale - invariant spectra and give more information on the cmb observations .    </S>",
    "<S> for the contracting phase before the bounce , the equation of motion in momentum space can be solved explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> we take the bunch - davies vacuum as the initial condition @xmath34 when the perturbation are deeply inside the horizon . since during this period @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 represents the initial time . substituting the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relationb ] ) into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eomp ] ) and solving it , we have the solution to the perturbation in the bouncing phase @xmath38 + d_k\\sin[k(\\eta-\\eta_b ) ] \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , for the nearly de - sitter expanding phase , we obtain @xmath39~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> having obtained the solutions of the perturbation equations in different phases , it is necessary to know the matching relations among these solutions and determine the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this depends on whether the curvature perturbation on a uniform comoving hypersurface or the gravitational potential passes through the bounce regularly @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent study ) . for a nonsingular bounce scenario such as what we considered </S>",
    "<S> , the continuity of background evolution implies that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are able to pass through the bounce smoothly . by matching @xmath47 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) on the surface @xmath49 , and that in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sol2 ] ) and ( [ sol3 ] ) in sub - hubble region on the surface @xmath50 as well as their comoving time derivatives , all of the coefficients can be determined . however , since @xmath45 represents a decaying mode when escape outside the horizon , we neglect it and finally obtain the dominant mode @xmath51 \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by comparing the coefficient of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fk ] ) and the initial form of @xmath47 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sol1 ] ) , one obviously notice that the sub - hubble form of the metric perturbation has obtained an oscillation term when the universe undergoes a bounce . note that , another important quantity is the curvature perturbation in comoving coordinate @xmath52 , and when the expansion is nearly de - sitter like , there is a simple relation between these two quantity @xmath53 with the slow roll parameter @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we eventually have the primordial power spectrum for the curvature perturbation @xmath55 where we have assumed @xmath56 to be small compared with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the first term provides a nearly scale - invariant spectrum which is consistent with current cosmological observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the second term apparently shows that there is a wiggle on the spectrum , due to the modification brought by a bounce .    for a numerical estimate of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , </S>",
    "<S> we normalize the current scale factor @xmath60 and choose the current hubble parameter @xmath61 , the hubble parameter during inflation @xmath62 , and the e - folds for inflation @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our model predicts that @xmath64 and @xmath65 . based on the primordial spectrum in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pzeta ] ) , in fig.[fig3:bounce ] we illustrate the cmb temperature power spectrum and present lss matter power spectrum . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered the standard case where @xmath59 is taken to be zero . in the numerical calculations we use the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package cosmomc @xcite and take the basic cosmological parameters as given below : @xmath66 and the pivot scale @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig.[fig3:bounce ] that our model leads to an obvious @xmath33-dependent oscillation signature in the power spectrum , especially at large scales .     and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the dots and error bars are wmap5 and sdss data . ]    to test our model we firstly consider the current astronomical observations from wmap5 @xcite and sdss @xcite , due to the large uncertainties at large scales as shown in fig.[fig3:bounce ] by the blue dots and the error bars , we find that the oscillating spectrum of our model is consistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> thus we consider the forthcoming measurements planck @xcite and lamost @xcite with higher precision . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the cmb tt , te and ee power spectra with the sensitivity of planck and the lss linear matter power spectrum with the sensitivity of lamost and find these measurements will be sensitive to @xmath69 which is smaller than our predicted value and makes our model testable . </S>",
    "<S> if this signal would be detected , it will act as a @xmath70 to the bouncing cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> physics of bouncing cosmology , since it happens in extremely high energy regime , is hardly to be found by experiments directly . </S>",
    "<S> so it is a debate whether a bounce has taken place or not . to find the evidences of a bounce </S>",
    "<S> , we need to know what can a bounce leave for observations . </S>",
    "<S> this question is still discussed drastically in the literature , and one potential clue is to study the primordial curvature fluctuations . in the context of the pre - big - bang scenario </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in the cyclic / ekpyrotic cosmology @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting curvature perturbation strongly depends on the physics at the epoch of thermalization , and thus an uncertainty of a thermalized surface is involved @xcite . in the frame of loop quantum cosmology , it is argued that fluctuations before and after the bounce are largely independent @xcite ( yet see ref.@xcite for some criticisms ) . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose a concrete cosmological model with inflation preceded by a bounce , and by investigating in detail the perturbations we show some imprints of the bounce are detectable to the forthcoming cmb and lss observations . </S>"
