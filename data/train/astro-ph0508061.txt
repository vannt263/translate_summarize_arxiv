    "for nearly a century astronomers have attempted to classify galaxies by their apparent shape and to draw conclusions about the process of galaxy formation and evolution from these morphologies .",
    "the basic hubble classification @xcite and its variants ( e.g. , @xcite ) divide galaxies into three broad categories : elliptical , disk , and irregular .",
    "this morphological classification correlates with , among other physical properties , the star formation activity of the galaxies .",
    "studies of local galaxy samples , as well as the currently - favored cold dark matter ( @xmath5 ) model , also suggest that interactions and mergers play an important role in the build up of galactic and stellar mass , through both the accretion of material and an increase in the star formation rate .",
    "thus , the morphological properties of galaxies as a function of cosmic time provide direct insight into the physical processes governing galaxy evolution",
    ".    in this manner , analysis of deep fields obtained primarily with the  ( hst ) suggest that the locally - defined hubble sequence may begin to break down at @xmath6 @xcite with the emergence of a sizable fraction of faint , irregular , and interacting systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while these observations , along with observations of local galaxies ( e.g.,@xcite ) , suggest that mergers play a significant role in the formation of galaxies , three important limitations prevent a conclusive connection between morphology and galaxy formation at higher redshift .",
    "first and foremost , studies of galaxy morphologies rely on flux - limited samples , which may contain a large fraction of atypical objects ; e.g. , ultra - luminous submillimeter galaxies @xcite , or @xmath7 mag optically - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , it is not clear how to relate the various samples ( e.g. , lyman break galaxies , submillimeter - selected galaxies , near - ir selected galaxies ) to the low redshift population or to each other .",
    "this is partly because of the different selection techniques and the differences in observed properties and space densities .",
    "finally , at faint fluxes ( @xmath8 mag ) , where irregular galaxies may dominate the population , the distance scale relies on photometric redshifts , whose accuracy is difficult to assess .    in this context",
    ", it is interesting to investigate the morphological properties of @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies .",
    "we now have conclusive evidence that grbs mark the death of massive stars @xcite and therefore pinpoint star - forming galaxies at all redshifts @xcite .",
    "this allows a uniform selection over a wide range of redshift and luminosity .",
    "in addition , absorption spectroscopy of the bright afterglows allows us to measure redshifts of arbitrarily faint galaxies .",
    "thus , the current grb host sample spans @xmath9 and @xmath10 to @xmath4 mag ( i.e. , @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) .    here",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of all optical hst observations of grb host galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this study is twofold : first , to obtain information on the large - scale environments in which grbs occur , as a clue to the formation of the progenitors .",
    "second , to survey a set of high redshift galaxies which are physically related by their star formation activity , but which alleviate some of the selection effects of other samples .",
    "we summarize the hst observations in  [ sec : data ] , provide a qualitative (  [ sec : morph ] ) and quantitative (  [ sec : sb ] ) analysis of the host morphologies , and compare the results to other high redshift galaxy samples (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we show that despite an overall diversity in the sizes and luminosities of grb hosts , they invariably have roughly exponential profiles , with a large fraction undergoing mergers and interactions .",
    "we retrieved data from the hst archive for all available grbs after `` on - the - fly '' pre - processing .",
    "these include @xmath13 grbs observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , @xmath14 grbs observed with the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , and @xmath15 grbs observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "details of the observations are summarized in table  [ tab : hst ] . for each grb we used the latest available images to reduce contamination from the afterglow and/or supernova emission .",
    "we processed and combined individual exposures using the iraf tasks drizzle ( stis , wfpc2 ) and multidrizzle ( acs ) in the stsdas package @xcite . in all cases we used pixfrac@xmath16 , with pixscale@xmath17 for the stis images , pixscale@xmath18 for the wfpc2 images , and pixscale@xmath19 for the acs images",
    "the resulting images have pixel scales of 0.025 , 0.07 , and 0.05 arcsec pix@xmath20 , respectively .    in figures  [ fig : stis ] and [ fig : wfpc - acs ] we show grayscale and color images of the individual host galaxies .",
    "all images are flux - calibrated in the ab system according to the zero - points listed in the instrument handbooks ( see also @xcite ) , and are corrected for galactic extinction @xcite . for grb011121 we used the extinction value determined by @xcite from observations of the afterglow .",
    "to classify the morphological properties of the grb host galaxies , we created eight different qualitative morphological categories .",
    "each category is independent of the others and galaxies may fit into more than one category . in this manner",
    "we are able to place a large number of galaxies into individual categories and account for multiple features .",
    "the categories are : concentrated elliptical or circular structure , or blob - like ( bl ) ; conspicuous disk structure ( d ) ; highly asymmetric or irregular structure ( as ) ; galactic structure containing knots ( kn ) ; galaxies with off - center peaks ( oc ) ; galaxies with tidal tails ( tt ) ; galaxies that are either undergoing mergers or are closely interacting ( mi ) ; and galaxies which are too faint for morphological analysis ( tf ) .",
    "the classification has been carried out independently by c.w .  and e.b . , and the results are summarized in tables [ tab : hst ] and [ tab : morph ] .    of the 45 host galaxies observed with hst ,",
    "three are not detected in our images , and an additional four are too faint to accurately categorize .",
    "these galaxies either occur at unknown redshifts , or @xmath21 .",
    "while these galaxies can not be classified morphologically , they do indicate that a non - negligible fraction of grbs ( and hence of the formation of massive stars ) occurs in very low luminosity and/or low surface brightness systems .",
    "in fact , given the measured redshifts and the magnitude limits for these galaxies we find that they typically have an absolute rest - frame @xmath22-band magnitude of @xmath23 mag , somewhat fainter than the large magellanic cloud .    for the remaining 38 galaxies with morphological classification we combine the basic categories into two general groups : regular and irregular / interacting .",
    "regular galaxies are those that are categorized exclusively as either blob- or disk - like .",
    "the primary difference between these two categories is that the blob - like galaxies have much higher luminosity concentrations , while the disk - like galaxies have symmetric extended features . in  [ sec : sb ] below we show that both the bl and d galaxies have surface brightness distributions that are well - described by exponential profiles and are therefore disk galaxies .",
    "the regular galaxies comprise about @xmath2 of the total sample .",
    "the irregular category includes galaxies that are asymmetric or show signs of a merger or interaction .",
    "the latter includes multiple bright galaxies ( e.g. , the hosts of grb020405 and xrf020903 ) , or galaxies with filamentary structures ( interpreted as tidal tails ) extending towards nearby galaxies with which they are interacting ( e.g. , the host of grb000926 ) .",
    "these tails are not symmetric about the center of the light distribution .",
    "a similar morphology is evident in the oc category , for which the extended low surface brightness emission is not likely to be part of an ordered disk structure .",
    "the majority of these galaxies do not have visible galactic neighbors .",
    "if they are the results of galactic mergers then they are most likely in the late stages of the merging process , or alternatively signal an interaction with a lower mass galaxy . in this context the environment of grb991208 may be of particular interest . a faint galaxy @xmath24 kpc from the host galaxy exhibits a tidal tail morphology suggesting that the host is interacting with a low mass companion",
    "it is also interesting to note that the host of grb991208 , with @xmath25 mag , is similar in brightness to the lmc , suggesting that mergers between dwarfs play an important role in the assembly of more massive galaxies ; an illustrative local example is ngc 1487 which is an interacting system of two dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric galaxies exhibit clumpiness or concavities in their light distribution which may be interpreted as the result of an interaction .",
    "however , this morphology may also be interpreted as clumpiness in the distribution of the star formation activity , particularly in the case of higher redshift hosts for which we sample the rest - frame uv light .",
    "we note that the latter explanation may be partially supported by the lack of obvious nearby companions , although as in the case of the oc galaxies , these systems may be in the late stages of merging .",
    "the same argument holds for galaxies exhibiting knots , which could be the remnant bright cores of merging galaxies or signs of patchy star formation activity .",
    "a relevant example is the host of grb990705 .",
    "this galaxy exhibits pronounced spiral structure with bright knots of star formation . at lower surface brightness ( or higher",
    "redshift ) the spiral arms may not be detected and the system might appear to have a knot morphology .    for the galaxies with morphological classification , the ratio of irregular and merging or interacting systems to regular systems is about @xmath26 .",
    "this ratio does not change significantly as a function of redshift . dividing the sample into @xmath27 ( low-@xmath28 ) and @xmath29 ( high-@xmath28 ) bins",
    ", we find that at low-@xmath28 regular galaxies account for about @xmath30 of the sample while @xmath31 are irregular .",
    "for the high-@xmath28 sample the fractions are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , with the remainder being too faint .",
    "the only two categories with possible evolution between the low- and high-@xmath28 samples are the tidal tails and disks .",
    "tidal tails occur in about @xmath34 of the low-@xmath28 population , but appear in @xmath35 of the high-@xmath28 population , while disk galaxies make up @xmath30 of the low-@xmath28 population and only @xmath36 of the high-@xmath28 population .",
    "the latter trend may be attributed to surface brightness dimming , but the increase in the frequency of tidal features with redshift may be real since surface brightness dimming would tend to have the opposite effect .",
    "we finally note that some ambiguity exists amongst our broad classifications .",
    "for example , the host of grb990123 may be interpreted as a merger / interaction with strong tidal tails , where the burst itself occurred in the disrupted galaxy .",
    "alternatively , this galaxy may be classified as a disk galaxy with a bright spiral arm accentuated by bright knots , which are presumably star forming hii regions . in this case",
    ", the burst was located in one of these bright knots .",
    "still , such cases comprise a relatively small fraction of the overall sample .",
    "observations of local galaxies suggest that the surface brightness profiles of disk galaxies are roughly exponential , while those of elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges tend to follow an @xmath37 de vaucouleurs law @xcite . in this section",
    "we determine the surface brightness profiles and sizes of the grb host galaxies and investigate their distributions as an additional input into their morphological classification .",
    "we determine the radial surface brightness distributions in two ways .",
    "first , for galaxies with a relatively simple apparent morphology we construct radial surface brightness plots using the iraf task phot , with a range of apertures chosen to span the full extent of each host galaxy while maintaining @xmath38 in each bin .",
    "a comparison of circular apertures to elliptical isophotes ( using the iraf task ellipse ) indicates that the difference is typically within the uncertainty in individual apertures .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profiles are shown in figures  [ fig : sbstis ] and [ fig : sbacs ] .",
    "for the host galaxies observed with wfpc2 and acs in multiple filters we also plot the radial color profiles ( figure  [ fig : sbcolor ] ) .",
    "none of the well - resolved host galaxies with high signal - to - noise detections exhibit a clear @xmath37 profile , confirming their nature as disk and irregular galaxies . with the exception of the host galaxy of grb991208 all the galaxies are well - resolved relative to the instrumental point spread function as measured from stars in the field ( figures  [ fig : sbstis ] and [ fig : sbacs ] ) .",
    "we thus fit the surface brightness profiles of all systems with an exponential disk : @xmath39 , leaving the central surface brightness ( @xmath40 ) and the scale length ( @xmath41 ) as free parameters .",
    "we find that the scale length distribution peaks at @xmath42 , with a tail extending to @xmath43 .    for the host galaxies observed in multiple filters",
    "we find that about @xmath44 exhibit a color gradient as a function of radius ( figure  [ fig : sbcolor ] ) , becoming redder at large radii .",
    "the single exception to this trend is the host galaxy of grb011121 , which is somewhat bluer at larger radii .",
    "since blue light traces recent star formation , the observed trend suggests that the star formation activity in grb host galaxies is more concentrated than the overall light distribution .",
    "the trend observed for grb011121 may suggest that substantial star formation is taking place across the whole disk of the galaxy . while color information is not available for the host of grb990705 , it too has fairly distributed star formation activity as shown by its spiral arm structure and bright knots .",
    "our second approach in studying the surface brightness profiles is to use the galfit software @xcite .",
    "this allows us to fit all but the most irregularly shaped galaxy ( grb020405 ) . in this case",
    "we use the generalized sersic function @xcite @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the concentration parameter ( @xmath47 is equivalent to an exponential disk , while @xmath48 is the de vaucouleurs profile ) , @xmath49 is a constant that is coupled to the value of @xmath46 , @xmath50 is the effective radius , and @xmath51 is the surface brightness at @xmath52 .",
    "we generated point spread functions for the individual instruments and filters using the tiny tim software package , assuming a power law spectrum @xmath53 , which is roughly appropriate for the observed color distribution of grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "in all cases we find adequate fits to the host galaxies , with @xmath54 per degree of freedom .",
    "we note that some sources , particularly at low signal - to - noise , can be adequately fit with a range of @xmath55 . for sources with complex morphology ( e.g. , xrf020903 ) or contaminating point sources ( e.g. , grb011121 ) we use multiple components to account for substructure .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath46 and @xmath50 are listed in table  [ tab : hst ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hists ] we plot the distribution of @xmath50 and @xmath46 for the hosts with an accurate value of @xmath46 . for hosts without a known redshift",
    "we take advantage of the flat evolution of the angular diameter distance with redshift , and assume a value of @xmath14 kpc arcsec@xmath20 appropriate for @xmath56 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath46 is strongly peaked around a value of @xmath57 , indicating that grb hosts are well described as exponential disks . as noted in other studies ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", @xmath58 is an efficient criterion for disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "the distribution of @xmath50 ranges from about 0.3 to 10 kpc , with a peak at @xmath59 kpc .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : renzmb ] we do not find any correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath46 or redshift , although we note that there is a larger dispersion in @xmath50 for @xmath60 .",
    "this may be a result of surface brightness dimming which would tend to make higher redshift objects appear more compact .",
    "a comparison to the morphological analysis of galaxies in the fires data @xcite suggests that the distributions of @xmath46 values are similar , with the exception that the latter exhibit a tail at @xmath61 ( ellipticals ) which may not present in the grb sample . the distribution of effective radii , however , peaks at a large value compared to the grb sample . to provide a direct comparison we corrected the values given in @xcite and @xcite for ellipticity and for the systematic over - estimate of about @xmath62 compared to galfit results ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the median effective radius of the fires galaxies is about a factor of two higher than that of the grb sample .",
    "the underlying reason for the smaller sizes of grb host galaxies is revealed in the correlation between the effective radius and the rest - frame absolute @xmath22-band magnitude , @xmath63 ( figure  [ fig : renzmb ] ) .",
    "the slope of the correlation for grb hosts is remarkably similar to the relation found by @xcite for local exponential disks , but with a surface brightness that is about @xmath64 mag arcsec@xmath65 higher .",
    "this is similar to the results found from the fires data , with the exception that the fires galaxies are brighter ( and hence larger ) .",
    "the sample of 42 grb host galaxies imaged with hst yields several interesting trends .",
    "the host morphologies and surface brightness profiles indicate that grb hosts are well described as exponential disks with sizes ranging from @xmath66 kpc .",
    "in addition , grb hosts exhibit a large fraction of interactions or mergers , particularly when compared to galaxies of similar luminosity from other surveys @xcite . with the exception of grb990705 , the grb hosts lack distinctive spiral structure despite having",
    "predominantly disk dominated surface brightness profiles .    as shown in ",
    "[ sec : sb ] the bulk of the galaxies have exponential surface brightness profiles .",
    "there are a few minor exceptions in low signal - to - noise filters , as well as in the case of grb021004 , for which we find an adequate fit with an @xmath37 profile using galfit ; a fit with @xmath47 is equally adequate . except for grb990705 , and",
    "possibly grb990123 , none of the grb host galaxies exhibit clear signs of spiral structure .",
    "this includes in particular the several hosts at @xmath67 , for which such structures should be easily detected .",
    "@xcite show that spiral and bar structures should be visible at redshifts as high as @xmath68 .",
    "the lack of ordered spiral structure in grb hosts may point to a violent merger history which suppresses the emergence of spiral arms .",
    "the observed size - luminosity correlation presented in figure  [ fig : renzmb ] is in good agreement with that observed in other galaxy samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the grb sample extends this relation to lower luminosities due to the availability of absorption redshifts which are not subject to the brightness limit for spectroscopy imposed on flux - limited surveys .",
    "three of the galaxies in our sample , grbs 980703 , 000418 , and 010222 , exhibit high luminosity at submillimeter and/or radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "contrary to the trend observed in submillimeter - selected galaxies @xcite , all three are highly symmetric and show no clear signs of interaction . each was categorized as a blob - like galaxy , while grb980703 was additionally categorized as off - center .",
    "however , it has the most modest deviation of any of the off - center galaxies in our sample . in comparison ,",
    "hst observations of submillimeter galaxies indicate a merger fraction of @xmath69 @xcite and a low percentage ( @xmath70 ) of symmetrically shaped galaxies @xcite .",
    "these three galaxies are also significantly bluer than the typical submillimeter - selected galaxies @xcite . taken together , these properties suggest that the submillimeter and radio bright grb hosts are a distinct population from the field submillimeter - selected galaxies .",
    "however , on the whole , a large fraction of the grb host galaxies show evidence of merging or interaction . about @xmath71 of our galaxies",
    "show evidence of merging .",
    "this proportion appears to be independent of both redshift and apparent magnitude .",
    "in other high redshift surveys , the proportion of interacting galaxies increases with galaxy brightness @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by one of several factors .",
    "first , it is possible that previous surveys have a selection bias against faint merging galaxies due to a flux limit .",
    "if this is the case , then previous surveys under - represent an important category of galaxy morphology .",
    "alternatively , the general correlation between magnitude and frequency of merging galaxies could be correct , and some physical process causes grbs to preferentially occur in faint merging systems , instead of bright ones , for example a preference for low metallicity * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the high fraction of galaxies which show signs of merging and interaction indicate that these are regions of elevated star formation activity , and that grbs are less likely to occur in stable disk galaxies .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive study of the morphological properties of 42 @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies imaged with the  in the optical band . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this study is to understand the relation of grbs to their macro - environments , and to compare the grb - selected galaxies to other high redshift samples . </S>",
    "<S> we perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses by categorizing the galaxies according to their visual properties , and by examining their surface brightness profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all of the galaxies have approximately exponential profiles , indicative of galactic disks , and have a median scale length of about 1.7 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the visual morphologies reveals a high fraction of merging and interacting systems , with @xmath1 showing clear signs of interaction , and an additional @xmath2 exhibiting irregular and asymmetric structure which may be the result of recent mergers ; these fractions are independent of redshift and galaxy luminosity . on the other hand , the three grb host galaxies for which submillimeter and radio emission has been detected are isolated and compact , unlike the luminous submillimeter - selected galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of mergers appears to be elevated compared to other high redshift samples , particularly for the low luminosities of grb hosts ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that merging and interacting galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation may be an efficient site for the production of grb progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that grb hosts clearly follow the size - luminosity relation present in other galaxy samples , but thanks to absorption redshifts they help extend this relation to lower luminosities . </S>"
