    "[ exp_data ] the theoretical results for both kinds of tubes in comparison to the experimental data .    including the electron - electron interactions substantially increases the resistivity and leads to a much better overall quantitative agreement with experiment .",

    "the deviation between the theoretical curve and the experimental data is never larger than @xmath252 k@xmath253 m .",
    "treating the electrons as non - interacting , on the other hand , gives a deviation which increases with temperature and is of the order of @xmath254 k@xmath253 m at @xmath255 k. qualitatively however , @xmath256 , in the approximation used and with @xmath244 , gives a concave function while the experimental curve is convex .",
    "in the zero temperature limit , the theoretically calculated @xmath257 then has , in particular , infinite slope contrary to what is observed experimentally . here it is , however , important to note that our approximation , using an infinite wire to calculate @xmath57 , breaks down for @xmath258 , i.e. , @xmath259 k. in the limit @xmath248 the properties will be instead dominated by the leads and we have to essentially use the free electron green s function in ( [ self - e ] ) so that the theoretical curve has to smoothly connect to the non - interacting result in this limit .",
    "the relevant microscopic parameters such as the electron - phonon coupling @xmath188 or the luttinger parameter @xmath260 are only approximately known while the chiral angle @xmath177 is even completely undetermined .",
    "we can thus try to improve the agreement with experiment by varying these parameters within a reasonable range .",
    "the measurements of the tunnel conductance@xcite seem to be convincing evidence that single wall carbon nanotubes are luttinger liquids with @xmath14 . in the experiment considered here this nanotube sits on an insulating substrate",
    "so there is no reason to expect that @xmath260 is significantly changed by screening effects . for the coupling constant @xmath188 , on the other hand , estimates obtained from experimental data and theoretical calculations vary between @xmath261 ev.@xcite since @xmath188 enters quadratically into the resistivity formulas this means that we can vary @xmath257 by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "a variation of the chiral angle @xmath177 for a tube with fixed diameter has a substantial effect on the resistivity as well as we have already demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ exp_data](a , b ) . however , as long as we keep @xmath244 the temperature dependence will never fully agree with the experimentally observed one .",
    "finally , we might try to fit the experimental data by assuming that the acoustic modes are quenched and the resistivity is caused purely by a coupling to the breathing mode .",

    "the result of such a fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_data2](a ) but the electron - phonon coupling @xmath263 ev needed is substantially larger than the largest estimates .",
    "this scenario thus seems unrealistic and the fit is not too convincing either . on the other hand",
    ", we can obtain an excellent fit of the data over the whole temperature range with a single power law as shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_data2](b ) . the exponent obtained in this fit is larger by about @xmath246 compared to the exponent obtained from the theoretical calculation at @xmath266 for the twiston and stretching contributions .",
    "interestingly , we can obtain such a power law where even the prefactor is of the right magnitude by multiplying our result ( [ twiston_relaxation ] ) for the resistivity due to the twiston mode with the characteristic phonon scale , @xmath267 . while this could be accidental ,",
    "the fact that a single power law yields an excellent fit over a wide temperature range and that the damping due to the phononic degrees of the tube gives a resistivity of the right magnitude is a strong indication that this is indeed the dominant mechanism although the theory so far can not fully explain the temperature scaling .",
    "we will speculate about possible modifications of this theory and discuss alternative explanations which can be found in the literature in the conclusions .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been twofold : on the one hand , we wanted to derive a general formula for the conductance of an interacting quantum wire with good contacts and current relaxing processes in the wire . on the other hand",
    ", we wanted to qualitatively understand the temperature and length - dependent scaling of the conductance measured in a recent experiment@xcite on single wall carbon nanotubes .    concerning the first part",
    ", we have shown that the approach by maslov and stone@xcite for an interacting ballistic wire contacted to leads can be generalized to an interacting wire with damping . under the assumptions that a luttinger liquid description is valid and that the current relaxing processes are predominantly taking part in the bulk of the wire",
    ", we were able to give the result for the electronic green s function for such a setup in closed form .",
    "this allowed us , in particular , to calculate the dc resistance which turned out to consist of two terms .",
    "the first is the quantum resistance multiplied by the luttinger parameter @xmath101 of the leads . as in the case without damping , there is thus no renormalization if we assume fermi liquid leads , @xmath136 .",
    "the second term is proportional to the length of the wire and the damping rate @xmath57 .",
    "while this general structure seems obvious , the important point is that @xmath57 , in this approximation , depends only on the luttinger parameter in the wire @xmath53 .",
    "we thus have a separation into a constant term , the quantum resistance , which only depends on the properties of the leads , and a term proportional to the length which only depends on the properties of the wire .    as a first application",
    ", we have calculated the resistance of an interacting quantum wire which has coexisting ballistic and diffusive channels .",
    "such a coexistence is expected for integrable models where part of the current is protected by a local or quasi - local conservation law.@xcite we find that in such a case the ballistic channel , however small , completely dominates the transport so that the system still shows ideal quantum conductance .",
    "however , it is important to mention that two assumptions have been made which can not be fulfilled in practice : ( 1 ) attaching an integrable wire to contacts will , in general , lead to non - integrable boundary conditions .",
    "( 2 ) there will also be relevant backscattering at the contacts which we have neglected .",
    "nevertheless , what this calculation does show is that a quantum wire which has an almost ballistic transport channel can display a conductance which stays close to the ideal quantum conductance over a wide temperature range .",
    "in the second part of the paper we have calculated the resistance of single - wall carbon nanotubes caused by a coupling to the phononic degrees of freedom of the tube .",
    "it is well known that there are three modes which have to be taken into account.@xcite these are an acoustic twist- and stretching mode as well as an optical breathing mode .",
    "previously , only the contribution of the twiston mode , which is the only one of the three modes active for an armchair tube , had been considered .",
    "if one assumes that the electrons are non - interacting then the coupling of the electrons to the twist distortions of the tube leads to a resistivity which increases linearly with temperature.@xcite interactions , however , are expected to change this temperature dependence.@xcite in our paper we have calculated the contribution of all three modes by using a luttinger liquid theory for the electrons and including the electron - phonon coupling in terms of a self - energy  obtained in second order perturbation theory  for the current - current correlation function .",
    "the result depends only on microscopic parameters of the cnt which mostly are relatively well known .",
    "a comparison with experiment shows that our results , which do take the electron - electron interactions into account , agree quantitatively better with experiment than the formula for non - interacting electrons .",
    "however , qualitatively the observed temperature dependence of the resistivity is different from the calculated one . for temperatures @xmath2 such that the coherence length @xmath268 we find @xmath269 with an exponent @xmath270 determined by the luttinger parameter of the total charge mode which theoretically and experimentally has been estimated to be around @xmath271@xcite leading to @xmath272 . the experimental data , on the other hand , are described extremely well by a power law with exponent @xmath273 .",
    "let us discuss possible reasons for these deviations and alternative explanations in the following .",
    "first , there is no reason to expect that @xmath260 substantially deviates from the used value . in the experiment",
    "the tube is placed on an insulating substrate so that screening should not take place .",
    "interactions with phonons can lead to a renormalization of @xmath260 but are only effective if the coulomb interaction is already screened.@xcite a renormalization to values leading to the observed exponent @xmath274 is out of the question in any case .",
    "since luttinger liquid properties have been theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally observed@xcite there seems to be no good reason to doubt the electronic part of our theory .",
    "this leaves the phononic part .",
    "there is a damping of the phonons due to phonon - phonon interactions which will modify the phonon propagator.@xcite however , this does not have any effect on our calculations since we are always effectively in a high temperature regime for the acoustic phonons because the sound velocities of the two acoustic modes are much smaller than the fermi velocity .",
    "the phonon modes are therefore always heavily populated and the phonon propagator simply becomes @xmath275 to leading order even if damping is included .    in several papers",
    "the possibility of a peierls distortion of the cnt has been discussed.@xcite if we have a distortion which leads to a finite expectation value of one of the acoustic modes , @xmath276 in eq .",
    "( [ twist - coup ] ) , then we can easily obtain the temperature dependence of the resistivity in the perturbative regime by scaling arguments . to obtain the self - energy in this case we now have to integrate over time _ and _ space and there is a factor of @xmath2 missing which before came from the phonon propagator .",
    "the scaling is therefore given by @xmath277 in the perturbative regime while @xmath257 will show thermally activated behavior at very low temperatures in the presence of a peierls distortion .",
    "none of this is seen in the experimental data .",
    "if the tube is exactly at half - filling then purely electronic umklapp scattering is also possible.@xcite note that the same term is called a forward scattering term in ref .  .",
    "the three umklapp operators in bosonized form are given by @xmath278 with @xmath210 .",
    "calculating again the self - energy for such a process in the perturbative regime and using scaling arguments we find that the resistivity due to umklapp scattering scales as @xmath279 .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependence is linear in the non - interacting case , @xmath239 , as already stated in ref .  .",
    "at very low temperatures umklapp scattering at half - filling will lead to gaps both in the charge and in the spin sector and thus to thermally activated behavior for @xmath257 . in a device configuration the filling in the tube is , however , usually tuned away from half - filling so that the umklapp term oscillates with @xmath280 and can thus be neglected at temperatures @xmath281 . even if umklapp scattering does contribute at higher temperatures its contribution will be smaller by a factor @xmath282 compared to the electron - phonon contribution so that for the tubes considered here the latter will always be dominant .",
    "there is an alternative explanation for the resistivity of cnts on surfaces which can be found in the literature.@xcite according to these papers the main contribution to the resistivity at room temperature stems from a coupling of the electrons to surface modes of the substrate .",
    "the experimental data are explained by combining the resistivity due to the coupling to the acoustic modes of the tube , which dominates at low temperatures , with the resistivity stemming from a coupling to the optical surface modes which yield the main contribution at higher temperatures . in the calculation of both contributions",
    "the electrons are treated as non - interacting .",
    "this assumption seems questionable .",
    "our calculation shows that once electron - electron interactions are included the interactions with the phonon modes of the tube alone give a resistivity of the right magnitude even at room temperature if standard parameters for the tube are used .",
    "if surface modes do indeed give the dominant contribution at room temperature then this would therefore require that the contribution due to the phonon modes of the tube is much smaller than expected .",
    "in particular , such a scenario requires @xmath283 ev .",
    "while our results provide a much better description of the experimental data than a non - interacting theory , the observed deviations have to remain as an interesting unsolved puzzle . a first step to resolve",
    "it would be experiments on free - standing tubes to see if the resistance substantially changes compared to the ones with the tube on a substrate which we considered here .",
