    "the first run of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern has successfully confirmed the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics with the discovery of a higgs boson with sm - like properties  @xcite . although no sign of physics beyond the sm has yet been observed , new phenomena at energies not far from the electroweak scale",
    "are predicted in many theories of new physics .",
    "there is therefore a great expectation for the upcoming lhc runs at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies and 14  tev , and for experiments at future accelerator facilities running at larger cm energies and luminosities .",
    "furthermore , even if new physics were not directly reachable at the lhc or future machines , it might still be indirectly probed through precision measurements of the properties of the sm particles . in this context , the top quark is believed to play an important role , due to the closeness of its mass to the electroweak scale .",
    "this has motivated an intense research program dedicated to the study of its properties at the lhc .",
    "future colliders will moreover be able to exploit the increase in cm energy and luminosity to probe indirect effects of new physics at higher momentum transfers , increasing the sensitivity to heavy new physics .",
    "the conceptual design studies of new accelerator complexes for future circular colliders ( fcc ) have recently started , at cern  @xcite and at ihep  @xcite .",
    "their ultimate goal is the operation of a proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) collider designed to operate at @xmath1  tev .",
    "this accelerator will allow the exploration of energy scales several times higher than at the lhc , and will also significantly increase the statistics of known particles .",
    "for example , one trillion top quarks should be available with an integrated luminosity of 10  ab@xmath2 .",
    "this consequently opens the door to indirect searches of new physics in the top sector with an unprecedented sensitivity .    in this paper",
    "we explore some of the opportunities offered by such a huge statistics of top quarks , focusing on the sensitivity to anomalous couplings to the gluons .",
    "the leading indirect effects from new physics present at a heavy scale @xmath3 can be parametrized by adding to the sm lagrangian @xmath4 a set of dimension - six operators @xmath5 invariant under the sm gauge symmetry  @xcite , @xmath6 where the wilson coefficients @xmath7 depend on the type of new physics and how it couples to the sm particles . after the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , these operators generate corrections to the sm couplings included in @xmath4 , as well as interactions not present at the tree level , such as electric dipole moments and explicit magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the effects on the top dipole moments can be parametrized by adding an effective term to the top - gluon gauge coupling , @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) being the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath11 the strong coupling constant , @xmath12 the top mass and @xmath13 the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the second term above contains both @xmath14 and @xmath15 interactions that arise , in the conventions of refs .",
    "@xcite , from the dimension - six operator @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the weak doublet of left - handed quark fields of third generation , @xmath18 the right - handed top quark field and @xmath19 is a weak doublet of higgs fields ( we define here @xmath20 ) .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , this operator yields the top dipole moments @xmath21 where @xmath22  gev is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of @xmath19 . for weakly - interacting new physics at the tev scale ,",
    "@xmath23 so that one expects @xmath24 .",
    "this exceeds both the chromomagnetic dipole moment generated in the sm at the one - loop level  @xcite and the associated negligible chromoelectric moment  @xcite .",
    "direct limits on the top chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moments can be derived from measurements of the @xmath25 inclusive cross section at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite , and of several @xmath25 differential distributions  @xcite . moreover , weaker bounds have been recently calculated  @xcite from a cms measurement of the @xmath25 spin correlation in lhc data at 8  tev  @xcite , as this observable is also modified by the anomalous interactions of eq .  .",
    "the most stringent limits on @xmath26 and @xmath27 however arise nowadays from low-@xmath28 probes , such as measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment , which constrain at the 90% confidence level ( cl )  @xcite , and rare @xmath29-meson decays , which imply @xmath30 at the 95%  cl  @xcite .",
    "at the lhc running at 14 tev , and even more at 100  tev , a significant amount of top - antitop pairs with a multi - tev invariant mass will be produced , with contributions dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion channel .",
    "these kinematical configurations with very large momentum transfer allow to explore the structure of the @xmath31 couplings at the shortest distances , and should then be particularly sensitive probes of the top dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "after revewing the constraints that can be obtained from the measurements of total production cross sections , in this paper we therefore focus on the study of very high mass top - antitop final states , where the top quarks are necessarily highly boosted .",
    "we consider a simple - minded approach to extract the top - antitop signal from the large qcd background , and verify that , at 100  tev , this is sufficient to significantly push the sensitivity to both chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments .",
    "the combination of inclusive @xmath32 cross section measurements at the tevatron and the lhc provides much stronger limits on the top dipole moments than the individual measurements .",
    "the complementarity of these two colliders is due to a very different functional dependence of the total cross section on @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the tevatron ( @xmath33 collisions at 1.96  tev ) and the lhc ( @xmath0 collisions at 7 , 8  tev ) , owing to the dominance of @xmath34 at the former collider and @xmath35 at the latter . making use of the feynrules package  @xcite to import the lagrangian of eq .   into madgraph5amc@nlo",
    "@xcite , we evaluate the @xmath32 total production cross section at the tevatron and the lhc with 8  tev , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , including the leading - order contributions of the top dipole moments . since the amplitudes contain at most two insertions of the anomalous vertices in eq .",
    "( [ ec : lagr ] ) , the dependence on @xmath27 and @xmath26 can be parametrized by a fourth - order polynomial in these two variables .. concerning the @xmath38 term , dimension - eight operators could generate additional contributions at the same @xmath39 order , and including them would change the interpretation of the limits obtained on @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "dropping quadratic and higher - order terms , or equivalently truncating the series at order @xmath40 , would imply to neglect effects that formally appear at order @xmath39 but that are relevant in the extraction of the limits .",
    "we have therefore adopted the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) . ]",
    "we find @xmath41 when employing the nnpdf  2.3 set of parton densities  @xcite .",
    "we extract the limits on @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevlhc8 ] by using the most recent total rate measurements at the tevatron , @xmath42 pb  @xcite , and the lhc with 8  tev , @xmath43 pb  @xcite , together with the most precise sm predictions at the next - to - next - to - leading order accuracy in qcd , @xmath44 pb and @xmath45 pb  @xcite . in the results displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : tevlhc8 ] , we define the sm case where there are no new physics contributions to the top dipole moments by .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the overlap of the corresponding 95% cl allowed regions from the tevatron ( dashed ) and the lhc ( solid ) measurements , and implies that and .",
    "our results are found compatible with the ones previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and given at the 68.3% cl , and are stronger than the bounds derived from the spin correlation measurements  @xcite .",
    "are rather similar to ours , and stable with respect to qcd corrections . ]    with the important amount of @xmath25 data to be collected at the upcoming lhc run with @xmath0 collisions at 14  tev , top dipole moments could be probed by going beyond the use of inclusive total cross sections , and could benefit from differential cross section measurements . for illustration",
    ", we consider three representative cases and focus on inclusive cross section measurements as well as on the production of @xmath25 pairs with an invariant mass @xmath46 required to be larger than either 1  tev or 2  tev .",
    "these last two observables are expected to exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to the top dipole moments because of the larger momentum transfers that are now ( phase - space ) favored and the specific lorentz structure of the top dipole operators in eq .  .",
    "for the inclusive measurement , our predictions rely on standard @xmath25 reconstruction techniques so that the @xmath25 signal is considered well separable from the background , in a way similar to what has been achieved with collision data at 7  tev and 8  tev .",
    "we subsequently assume an overall uncertainty of 5% on the would - be measurement at 14  tev .",
    "( for comparison , the 8 tev measurement has a 3.5% uncertainty . )    when the @xmath32 system has an invariant mass @xmath47  tev or 2  tev , the produced top quarks are usually boosted .",
    "this renders any associated measurement more difficult because of both the smaller statistics and the large qcd multijet contribution where a pair of boosted top and antitop quarks is faked . in order to realistically estimate the uncertainty that would be associated with measurements in such regimes , we restrict our analysis to @xmath25 pairs produced in the central region of the detector ( with a pseudorapidity satisfying @xmath48 ) .",
    "this ensures a better performance of the top tagging algorithms due to a finer detector granularity , so that one could aim for a better rejection of the qcd background .",
    "we employ , in the @xmath47  tev ( 2  tev ) case , the third working point of cms for top quarks with a transverse momentum @xmath49  gev ( 800  gev )  @xcite , so that a boosted top quark will be correctly tagged with an efficiency of about 12.5% , for a mistagging rate of a qcd jet as a top quark of about 0.03% ( the studies of top - tagging performance by atlas are documented in ref .",
    "we present , in table  [ tab:1 ] , the corresponding fiducial cross sections for both the top - antitop signal and the multijet background , together with the sensitivity defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath29 are the numbers of signal and background events normalized to a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath2 , respectively .",
    ".fiducial cross sections for boosted @xmath25 and dijet production at the lhc ( ) , after accounting for a centrality requirement and appropriate top tagging and misidentification rates .",
    "the sensitivities are normalized to 100 fb@xmath2 of simulated collisions .",
    "[ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to generate the following results , we considered the three reference @xmath52 thresholds of 6 , 10 and 15 tev .",
    "the corresponding requirements on the @xmath53-variable , which we used to optimize the signal significance , are given in table  [ tab : fcc ] .",
    "we also include here the luminosities that are necessary for a signal extraction at the @xmath54 level .",
    "we have verified that the results are similar when using herwig++  @xcite instead of pythia , or alpgen+herwig6",
    "@xcite .     and @xmath27 at 100  tev after considering top - antitop pairs with an invariant mass larger than 6  tev ( solid blue ) , 10  tev ( solid red ) and 15  tev ( solid purple ) .",
    "for comparison , the expected limit from the second run of the lhc , with @xmath55  tev , ( dashed line ) and indirect limits ( dotted lines ) are also displayed . ]    using the above results to deduce the statistical uncertainties associated with a would - be @xmath32 cross section measurement at 100  tev , we additionally account for systematic uncertainties of 5% before deriving the expectation for constraining the top dipole moments .",
    "( as previously discussed , we use a 5% systematic uncertainty as a reasonable reference value . )",
    "assuming an integrated luminosity of 10  ab@xmath2 , we display our results on fig .  [",
    "fig : fcc ] , together with the limits expected from the lhc run at 14  tev when using @xmath56 pairs with @xmath55  tev . as for the lhc case",
    ", the selection on the top - antitop invariant mass enforces the contributions to the @xmath32 cross section that are quadratic in @xmath26 and @xmath27 to dominate , so that the allowed regions of the @xmath57 plane are ellipses .",
    "as also suggested by table  [ tab : fcc ] , the statistical uncertainties start to be important for large @xmath46 thresholds , so that the bounds derived when @xmath58  tev are similar to those obtained when @xmath59 tev .",
    "an optimal @xmath46 selection would however strongly depend on the boosted top identification efficiency and mistagging rate , and may be different from the ones deduced in our simplified approach that only aims to show that the observation of @xmath32 pairs at high invariant mass can be envisaged . enforcing @xmath59 tev , the top dipole moments are bound to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which improves the lhc results by about one order of magnitude , leading to constraints that are comparable to the indirect ones obtained from @xmath29-decays and from the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "( in any case , direct and indirect limits are complementary , since the latter are much more model - dependent and can be evaded with additional new physics contributions . )",
    "conversely , these limits can be translated in terms of a lower bound on the scale at which new physics could be expected , which is found to satisfy @xmath62  tev .",
    "this again ensures that the effective lagrangian of eq .   is valid with respect to the magnitude of the probed momentum transfers",
    "direct limits on the top dipole couplings improve greatly by probing higher momentum transfers , as a consequence of their lorentz structure .",
    "a 100  tev @xmath0 collider is therefore a suitable machine to explore these anomalous interactions , in order to expose the indirect effects of new heavy states . in this paper , we have investigated the sensitivity of the future run of the lhc at 14  tev and of a 100  tev collider to anomalous top chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we have considered both the study of @xmath56 inclusive cross sections and of top - antitop pairs with a multi - tev invariant mass .",
    "the summary of our results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] where we compare the current direct bounds to the projected limits for 100 fb@xmath2 at 14  tev and 10 ab@xmath2 at 100 tev .",
    "the sensitivity at 100  tev is expected to allow for a very important improvement of the bounds derived from measurements at the tevatron and at the previous and future lhc runs , so that the @xmath26 and @xmath27 allowed ranges could be reduced by more than one order of magnitude with respect to the current direct limits .",
    "furthermore , one may also wonder whether the expected lhc limits on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , obtained from @xmath25 spin correlation measurements and @xmath63-odd triple product asymmetries , respectively , could be improved at 100  tev ( at the lhc , they are of the same order as the expected ones from cross section measurements in fig .  [",
    "fig : lhc14 ] ) . clearly , considering large energy scales  by selecting , for instance , high-@xmath46 top - antitop pairs as done in this work",
    " enhances the effect on the anomalous contributions , not only in the fiducial cross section but also in the angular distributions .",
    "however , the angular distributions that may be measured in a typical lhc boosted top kinematical regime of @xmath64 tev ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) may not be useful for ultra - boosted tops , and deserve further investigations .",
    "further studies would also be desirable to evaluate the complementarity of the measurements discussed in this paper , with those possible with @xmath65 collisions at the top - antitop threshold , where a large statistics is foreseen by the @xmath65 option of the fcc complex  @xcite , and at higher energies ( _ e.g. _ , at clic  @xcite or ilc  @xcite ) .    as a byproduct of our study , we developed and described a new robust and effective approach to the problem of tagging top - antitop final states of large invariant mass , exploting the hard muon spectrum in top decays .",
    "we are confident that more detailed studies of top - tagging algorithms , made possible also by the more aggressive detector technologies envisaged for the future collider experiments , can further improve our results .",
    "what we showed is just an example of possible opportunities offered by the huge samples of top quarks available at a 100 tev @xmath0 collider .",
    "other areas that would certainly benefit include the study of rare or forbidden decays ( _ e.g. _ @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , tests of electroweak couplings ( e.g. in @xmath68-channel single top production @xmath69 at very large invariant mass ) , and high - precision measurements of production asymmetries , spin correlations , etc .",
    "we look forward to future studies addressing these observables .",
