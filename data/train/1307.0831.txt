    "the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite , fundamental to our conceptual understanding of quantum field theory and critical phenomena , is also the basis of important approaches to many - body problems . in rg methods",

    "invariant fixed point , the universal , low energy properties of the phase can then be extracted .",
    "the rg is also at the core of certain holographic constructions , where the many - body system is regarded as the boundary of another system in one additional dimension corresponding to scale .",
    "a prominent example is the ads / cft duality @xcite of string theory , where a conformal field theory ( cft ) in @xmath7 space - time dimensions is dual to a gravity theory in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "entanglement renormalization @xcite is a modern formulation of real - space rg for quantum systems on a lattice , based on the removal of short - range entanglement at each coarse - graining step . by concatenating coarse - graining transformations ,",
    "one obtains the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite , an efficient tensor network representation of the many - body ground state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : directedmera](a ) .",
    "the mera spans an additional dimension corresponding to rg scale and is thus regarded as a lattice realization of holography @xcite .",
    "importantly , this tensor network ( and generalizations thereof @xcite ) is expected to produce a holographic description of _ any _ many - body system and , in particular , it is not restricted to operate in the so - called _ strong coupling , large-@xmath9 _ regime that produces a _",
    "weakly coupled , semi - classical _ gravity dual  as required in many practical applications of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the mera is a promising tool to gain insights into the structure of holography for a generic many - body system @xcite , regardless of whether it has e.g. a weakly coupled , semi - classical gravity dual .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "the authors already used the mera to explore the _ modular _ character of holography namely the possibility of building a holographic description of a complex system by stitching together pieces ( or modules ) corresponding to the holographic description of simpler systems and apply it to the study of critical systems with impurities , boundaries , interfaces , and @xmath10-junctions .    in this paper",
    "we propose a theory of _ minimal updates _ in holography .",
    "specifically , we address the following question : given the ground states @xmath4 and @xmath5 of two hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 that only differ in a region @xmath3 of a @xmath2-dimensional lattice @xmath11 @xcite , how much do we have to modify the holographic description of @xmath4 in order to produce a holographic description of @xmath5 ?",
    "we claim that the answer to this question can be formulated in simple geometric terms : _ a holographic description for @xmath5 can be obtained by modifying that of @xmath4 only in the causal cone @xmath6 of region @xmath3 _ , where @xmath6 is the part of the holographic description that traces the evolution of the region @xmath3 under coarse - graining .",
    "this claim , supported by abundant numerical evidence @xcite , will be justified here theoretically in terms of a notion of _ directed influence _ in the rg flow , which we argue to also underpin the success of wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite for impurity problems .",
    "directed influence leads to an extremely compact , accurate holographic representation of a critical system with an impurity by minimally updating the mera of a homogeneous system .",
    "more generally , as argued in ref . , directed influence implies the modular character of holography .",
    "of a lattice hamiltonian @xmath0 in @xmath12 space dimensions ( modified binary scheme of ref . ) .",
    "scale and translation invariance result in a compact description : two tensors ( @xmath13 ) are repeated throughout the infinite tensor network .",
    "( b ) the ground state @xmath5 of the hamiltonian @xmath14 is represented by a mera with the same tensors ( @xmath13 ) outside the causal cone @xmath15 ( shaded ) .",
    "inside , scale invariance implies again a very compact description : two new tensors ( @xmath16 ) repeated throughout the semi - infinite causal cone .",
    "( c - d ) the same illustrations , without drawing the tensors of the network.,width=321 ]    for concreteness , let us consider a hypercubic lattice @xmath11 in @xmath2 space dimensions , and a particular mera for the ground states @xmath4 and @xmath5 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 based on a coarse - graining transformation that maps a hyper - cubic block of @xmath17 sites into one effective site , as illustrated for @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : directedmera](a ) @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the mera describes both the ground state of the system and a sequence of coarse - graining transformations , where the latter are labeled with a scale parameter @xmath18 , with @xmath19 . to simplify the notation",
    ", we will assume that @xmath0 is a translation invariant , quantum critical hamiltonian corresponding to a fixed - point of the rg flow , so that @xmath4 is invariant both under translations and changes of scale .",
    "accordingly the mera for @xmath4 can be completely specified by a single pair ( @xmath13 ) of tensors that are repeated throughout the entire tensor network @xcite .",
    "[ however , the proposed minimal updates do not require translation or scale invariance . ]",
    "the causal cone @xmath6 of a region @xmath3 of the lattice @xmath11 , see fig . [ fig : directedmera](b ) , was originally defined as the part of the holographic tensor network that can affect the properties of the state @xmath4 in region @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the peculiar structure of causal cones in the mera is the key reason why one can _ efficiently _ compute expectation values of local observables from this tensor network @xcite .",
    "here we argue that the causal cone @xmath6 also defines the region of the mera that needs to be updated in order to account for a change of the hamiltonian in region @xmath3 , fig .",
    "[ fig : directedmera](c)-(d ) .",
    "we emphasize that this new role of the causal cones , of clear physical significance and ( as we will argue ) ultimately connected to the existence of different energy scales in the hamiltonian @xmath0 , is unrelated to the computational considerations that guided the design of the mera @xcite .",
    "geometrically , the causal cone @xmath6 is the part of the tensor network that contains the evolution of region @xmath3 under successive coarse - graining transformations . to further simplify the analysis",
    ", we will assume that @xmath3 is a hyper - cubic region @xmath3 made of @xmath17 sites @xcite .",
    "this region can be see to be mapped into an identical hyper - cubic region with @xmath17 sites under coarse - graining transformations ( see appendix [ apdxa ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the ground state @xmath5 of hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath20 accounts for an impurity on the hyper - cubic region @xmath3 made of @xmath17 sites .",
    "our claim is that a mera for @xmath5 can be obtained from the mera for the ground state @xmath4 in the absence of the impurity by simply replacing , inside the causal cone @xmath6 , the tensors ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) with new tensors .",
    "specifically , if the impurity is itself already a new rg fixed - point ( e.g. a conformal defect in a cft @xcite ) , which implies that @xmath5 is still scale invariant , then the entire causal cone @xmath6 can be completely specified by a single new pair ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) of tensors , see fig .",
    "[ fig : directedmera](b ) .    in ref .",
    "we have presented abundant numerical evidence supporting the validity of the proposed minimal update , and have argued that this construction naturally reproduces : ( @xmath25 ) the power - law scaling of expectation values of local observables ( e.g. of the local magnetization in the case of a magnetic impurity ) with the distance to the impurity ; and ( @xmath26 ) the set of new scaling operators and scaling dimensions attached to the impurity @xcite .",
    "the above compact description in terms of just two pairs of tensors @xmath27 , valid even in the thermodynamic limit , is somewhat surprising .",
    "after all , one would expect that coarse - graining the impurity system , which is not translation invariant , would require the use of different coarse - graining tensors @xmath28 at different locations @xmath29 of lattice @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , the number of variational parameters , proportional to the number of different tensors in the mera , would grow linearly in the size of the system . instead , by only updating the causal cone @xmath6 [ which amounts to exploiting the translation invariance of hamiltonian @xmath0 to describe the ground state of @xmath1 ] we can address an impurity system directly in the thermodynamic limit , and thus avoid finite size effects when extracting the universal properties of the critical impurity @xcite .",
    "similar constructions are also possible for more complex systems , including systems with a boundary , an interface or a @xmath10-junction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : defects ] , for which recursive application of minimal updates leads to the modular mera , as discussed in @xcite .",

    "we call the _ wilson chain _ of region @xmath3 , denoted @xmath36 , the semi - infinite , one - dimensional lattice built by coarse - graining the @xmath2-dimensional lattice @xmath11 by all the tensors in the mera that lay outside the causal cone @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , each site of the wilson chain @xmath36 is uniquely labeled by a value of the scale parameter @xmath18 and it collects together all the effective sites at scale @xmath18 obtained through the above coarse - graining , see fig .",

    "the structure of the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath42 , with exponentially decaying nearest - neighbor terms , is similar to that obtained by wilson as part of his resolution of the kondo impurity problem  a single impurity in a three dimensional bath of three fermions @xcite .",
    "however , we note that while having a free fermion bath was key in wilson s derivation of an effective one - dimensional lattice model , here we use the mera to ( at least in principle ) address non - perturbatively any type of @xmath2-dimensional bath .",
    "following wilson s nrg method @xcite ( see appendix [ apdxb ] ) , the ground state of @xmath42 can be obtained by identifying , progressing iteratively over @xmath18 , the low energy subspace @xmath55 of the first @xmath39 sites of @xmath36 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vector space of site @xmath18 in @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig : directedmps](c)-(d ) . that is , assuming the validity of the nrg approach , changes in the hamiltonian at length scale @xmath45 only affect the ground state representation at larger length scales , a property that we refer to as _ directed influence _ in the rg flow .",
    "we emphasize that the validity of wilson s nrg , and thus also directed influence , relies heavily on the factor @xmath64 to induce a separation of energy scales in the problem .",
    "when such a separation of energy scales is present , then the treatment of one energy scale at a time as prescribed by the nrg approach can be justified from perturbation theory ( see appendix [ apdxb ] ) . in the absence of such a factor",
    "the nrg approach would typically fail @xcite , such that directed influence would also fail , and a change in the hamiltonian at length scale @xmath45 could affect the ground state representation at all length scales @xmath18 .",
    "we are finally ready to show that the validity of the proposed minimal update in the mera follows from assuming the validity of directed influence in wilson chains .",

    "we see that the effective hamiltonians @xmath72 and @xmath73 , corresponding to the homogeneous and impurity systems respectively , only differ at the length scale @xmath79 , where the causal cones @xmath6 and @xmath66 become coincident . directed influence implies that the mps representations of the ground states of @xmath72 and @xmath73 only need to differ at scales @xmath47 , i.e. that the tensors in @xmath80 at scales @xmath81 , which lie outside of the causal cone @xmath15 , may be left unchanged .",
    "this argument is general for any local region @xmath82 , thus justifying the proposal of minimal updates in mera .",
    "the holographic description of a many - body system based on real - space rg is not unique .",
    "since the mera is built by concatenating several coarse - graining transformations , there is indeed some freedom as to how we choose to coarse - grain the system at a given length scale , provided that we compensate for our choice when coarse - graining the system at larger length scales .",
    "the minimal update discussed in this paper corresponds to a particular choice of this freedom in coarse - graining . by restricting the update to the causal cone @xmath6 of region @xmath3 ,",
