    "in recent studies of large-@xmath2 baryons and mesons  @xcite , many results derived originally in the skyrme model , the chiral bag model and the chiral quark soliton model have been obtained using algebraic methods , where the algebra is inferred from the behavior of large-@xmath2 qcd  @xcite .",
    "the algebraic method does not depend on the details of dynamics , and can provide a clear understanding of the results obtained in specific models .",
    "furthermore , it provides a method for systematic calculation of higher order terms in the @xmath5 expansion for meson - baryon coupling constants , magnetic moments and other quantities  @xcite .",
    "a different but related algebraic method was developed by amado and collaborators for finite @xmath2 corrections to the skyrme model , borrowing ideas from the interacting boson model in nuclear physics  @xcite . from the perspective of the modern work on large-@xmath2 qcd",
    "it has now become clear that the group considered by them is the minimal one consistent with the large-@xmath2 behavior of qcd .",
    "this immediately raises the question whether other realizations of the algebra exist , that have the same limit for @xmath6 , but lead to different predictions for finite @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we discuss this question looking at the nucleon matrix elements of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are related to the axial vector coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "our motivation is twofold : + ( 1 ) the fact that those quantities were calculated successfully in several different chiral models  @xcite strongly suggests that there should exist a feature common to those models , which is based on the underlying algebraic structure .",
    "our main purpose is therefore to construct an algebraic model which is able to explain those results .",
    "+ ( 2 ) in the algebraic method , skyrme model results have been interpreted to be the limit of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "specifically , this has been explicitly shown using the so called quark representation , the symmetric representation with young tableau @xmath11 $ ] of the su(4 ) group generated by spin and isospin .",
    "a seeming advantage of this representation is that it produces not only the large-@xmath2 limit correctly but also the quark model results at finite @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out , however , that this is not always the case . for a quantity such as",
    "the nucleon spin @xmath0 the skyrme model result , which is essentially zero  @xcite , is not reproduced in the quark representation .",
    "therefore , we construct an appropriate parameterization which reproduces both the skyrme and the quark model limits for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this requirement leads to a study of models with a dynamical symmetry group that is large enough to have @xmath12 as a subgroup . in order to get interesting models we let ourselves be guided by some aspects of effective models of qcd",
    ", that might be particularly relevant for the physical questions considered here .",
    "of course a dynamical symmetry requires that we associate some dynamics with the models we consider . in the present note",
    "we shall concentrate on the states , and will not discuss what hamiltonians lead to such a state .",
    "fortunately , such hamiltonians do exist .",
    "they will be the subject of a separate study .",
    "in the following two sections , we repeat some of the essential details of the large-@xmath2 algebra as first set out in the paper by gervais and sakita  @xcite .",
    "for that purpose consider the pion - nucleon scattering amplitude . to leading order ,",
    "the relevant born terms are given by [ tpin ] m ~n_c _ y \\ { - } , here @xmath13 are the yukawa vertices with the @xmath14 dependence factored out , and @xmath15 are the masses of the baryons . in these quantities ,",
    "subscripts @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 specify the quantum numbers for the baryons which are in the fundamental representations of the spin and isospin symmetries , @xmath19 etc , while @xmath20 , @xmath21 stand for the quantum numbers of the pions .",
    "the latter label the adjoint representations of the same spin - isospin group , since the pion carries isospin one and it couples with the nucleon through the p - wave . from unitarity and also from the witten s large-@xmath2 counting rule",
    "@xcite , the scattering amplitude is bounded from below for arbitrary @xmath2 . thus the two terms in ( [ tpin ] ) must cancel each other in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "this is the primary consistency condition for large-@xmath2 qcd  @xcite .",
    "it is satisfied if the mass differences of the tower of states built upon the nucleon go to zero in this limit and the following relation holds , [ tcommute ] _ y ( ^_xy ^_yz - ^_xy ^_yz ) 0 . here",
    "the left hand side must be suppressed as proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "equation ( [ tcommute ] ) is now regarded as a matrix equation for @xmath22 whose components are @xmath23 .    in the limit @xmath10 , combining the spin and isospin algebra for light flavors , @xmath24 , with that generated by ( [ tcommute ] ) , we obtain the following commutation relations : & = & i f^abc ^c , + [ ktalge ] & = & i d(a)^_^ , + & = & 0 . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the generators and the structure constants for the group @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 are the matrices of the generators @xmath29 in the basis of @xmath20 : @xmath30",
    ". equations ( [ ktalge ] ) shows that @xmath29 and @xmath22 form the non - compact group algebra @xmath31 , the semi - direct product of @xmath27 by the abelian group @xmath32 generated by @xmath22 .",
    "because of this non - compact nature of the group , the baryon states form an infinite tower of states with spin equal to isospin @xmath33 , etc .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the construction of representations for the large-@xmath2 group @xmath31 is performed by the method of induced representations .",
    "equivalently one can use the technique of group contractions starting from the compact group @xmath12 . here",
    "we see naturally how the extrapolation to infinite @xmath2 is performed .",
    "the first step in the argument is based on the fact that the number of generators of @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and the @xmath32 a direct product of the adjoint representations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , n=(p^2 - 1 ) + ( q^2 - 1 ) + ( p^2 - 1)(q^2 - 1 ) = ( pq)^2 - 1 , is the same as the number of generators of the @xmath38 group .",
    "let us look at the @xmath39 subgroup of @xmath38 .",
    "let us denote the generators of the subgroup by @xmath40 , and the remaining generators by @xmath41 .",
    "the algebra now takes the form & = & i f^abc ^c , + [ sualge ] & = & i d(a ) ^_^ , + & = & i ( g_1^ ^+ g_2^c ^c ) .",
    "here @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the structure constants . for the case of @xmath45 ,",
    "the constants @xmath43 vanishes and the last commutators of ( [ sualge ] ) can be written as [ wwcommu ] [ ^ia , ^jb ] = _ ijk _ ab j^k + _ abc _",
    "ij i^c , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the generators of the spin and isospin group .",
    "consider now the @xmath48-dimensional symmetric representation of @xmath12 and suppose that the matrix elements of @xmath41 are of order @xmath48 .",
    "the group contraction @xmath49 can be performed by first replacing @xmath50 by @xmath51 . in the limit",
    "@xmath52 the algebra ( [ sualge ] ) written in terms of @xmath53 then reduces to the algebra ( [ ktalge ] ) .",
    "the index @xmath48 can then be identified with the number of colors in what has been called the `` quark representation '' ( which refers to valence quarks ) as shown in the following .",
    "consider the wave function of a baryon .",
    "it can be written as a direct product of orbital , spin , isospin ( flavor ) and color parts .",
    "since the color part is totally antisymmetric ( it has young tableau @xmath54 $ ] ) the rest of the wave function must be totally symmetric , with young tableau @xmath11 $ ] . for ground state baryons ,",
    "quarks are assumed to be in the lowest s state , which gives a symmetric orbital wave function , and thus the spin and isospin part must be symmetric as well .",
    "the symmetric representation of @xmath55 is specified by an index @xmath48 , which must now be identified with the number of colors @xmath2 .",
    "let us introduce operators which generate the fundamental representations for spin and isospin group , @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , @xmath57 annihilates a spin down up quark . the symmetric @xmath2 representation of the @xmath12 group is then generated by the defensive hedgehog state  @xcite ( the name defensive hedgehog state derives from the skyrme model , where this state corresponds to a pion field that point radially outwards , as on a hedgehog defending itself ) |n_c;h_q&= & ^n_c |0 , [ nquark ] where on the left hand side the subscript @xmath58 indicates that the state is the quark representation .",
    "the operator in square brackets is exactly what is obtained by coupling the spin and isospin to zero .",
    "this coupling to `` grand - spin '' @xmath59 is typical of a hedgehog state .",
    "the state ( [ nquark ] ) breaks rotational and iso - rotational symmetries .",
    "this is possible since all states obtained by applying an isospin rotation operator @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the two - by - two unitary matrix specifying the transformation ) on the defensive hedgehog state ( [ nquark ] ) are degenerate , |n_c ; h_q[a ] & & r(a)|n_c;h + [ nha ] & & = ^n_c |0 . here @xmath62 are the @xmath63-functions of rank @xmath64 .",
    "the semi - classical nature in the limit @xmath10 is reflected in the overlap function , n_c;h[a^]| n_c ; h[a]= ^n_c , where @xmath65 represents symbolically the relative angle between the `` orientations '' @xmath61 and @xmath66 . after an appropriate rescaling of the states this overlap goes to a delta function  @xcite n_c;h[a^]| n_c ; h[a]= ( a - a^ ) . this sharp peaking is characteristic of a semiclassical limit .",
    "the nucleon state @xmath67 can be projected out from the hedgehog state @xmath68 by taking the appropriate combination of rotated hedgehogs @xcite , [ project ] |nd[a ] d^1/2*_t ,-",
    "m(a ) r(a ) | h . here the nucleon third components of spin and isospin equal @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the nucleon matrix elements of an observable @xmath71 can now be computed as _",
    "n = , where the denominator is needed for normalization .",
    "let us now calculate the two axial - vector coupling constants for the nucleon , @xmath9 and @xmath1 . for @xmath9 we should consider the @xmath72 effects seriously , but these effects will be ignored here , and we shall see how a simple construction behaves for these quantities .",
    "the actual computation is performed most conveniently using the euler angles @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath73 for the rotation matrix @xmath61 .",
    "the computational procedure is straightforward @xcite and we just give the results here . @xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined by the nucleon matrix elements of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the expectation values in the @xmath76 state are p | s_3 | p & = & - n_c + [ nsigma ] & = & - = -1 .",
    "and p | t_33 | p & = & - + [ nsigmatau ] & = & - ( 1 + ) . here",
    "we have introduced the notations @xmath77 , and @xmath78 = \\sin \\beta \\ , d\\beta \\ , d\\alpha \\ , d\\gamma$ ] .",
    "the minus signs appear because the matrix elements are evaluated for the @xmath79 state .",
    "the result ( [ nsigma ] ) , @xmath80 , as independent of @xmath2 is trivial , since the nucleon spin here is entirely carried by the intrinsic quark spin , which is the result of the non - relativistic valence quark model . on the other hand ,",
    "the result ( [ nsigmatau ] ) depends on @xmath2 ; it becomes ( neglecting the minus sign ) 5/3 when @xmath2 = 3 as in the valence quark model , while it approaches @xmath2 in the limit @xmath10 as corresponding to the skyrme model result .",
    "thus the quark representation is believed to interpolate between the quark model and the skyrme model results when @xmath2 goes from 3 to @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "this is the case for @xmath1 , but is not true for the other matrix element of the nucleon spin , @xmath82 .",
    "in this section we consider other algebraic realizations for the group @xmath12 which is contracted to the large-@xmath2 algebra in the limit @xmath10 . by doing this , we will see a novel behavior of the matrix elements for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "first we consider the relativistic effects which involve the lower components of the wave function with orbital angular momentum @xmath83 = 1 . formally this can be achieved by first extending the rotational group su(2 ) to @xmath84 for spin ( @xmath85 ) and orbital angular momentum ( @xmath83 ) group , and then take its diagonal subgroup : @xmath86 , where the generators of the diagonal group is the sum @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath88 group is now combined with the isospin @xmath89 group to form the desired chain @xmath90 , where the subscript @xmath58 on the left hand side indicates that this algebra is realized by the quarks .",
    "we shall not discuss other possible dynamical origins of orbital excitations in this note , which are discussed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second extension is to include explicit pions , that also form a hedgehog state .",
    "since a pion can form a grand - spin @xmath91 state through the coupling of its unit isospin and @xmath92 orbital angular momentum ( p - wave ) , the relevant group is @xmath93 , which we once more imbed in an @xmath12 group .",
    "therefore , the extended group for the hedgehog quarks and the pions would be ( 4)_q _ ( 4)_q ( 4)_. once again , we pick up the diagonal subgroup , @xmath94    the relativistic hedgehog quarks are now written as [ hqrel ] |n_c;h= (    c c_1 ^k=0 + c_2 ^k=0    ) ^n_c |0^n_c |0 . here",
    "the coupling scheme is @xmath95^j,\\ , i]^k$ ] and @xmath96^{j=1/2},\\ , \\thalf\\right]^{k=0 } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( \\alpha^\\dagger_{\\udown}-\\alpha^\\dagger_{\\dup})$ ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , dictate the ratio of the upper ( @xmath100 ) and lower ( @xmath92 ) components , the precise values of which are determined dynamically .",
    "the last expression of ( [ hqrel ] ) is useful in actual computation .",
    "we wrote the matrix @xmath101 instead of the algebraic operator @xmath85 to exhibit the fact that it only acts on a _ single _ operator @xmath102 .",
    "the transformation @xmath103 acts on the spin components of the operator @xmath102 .",
    "the matrix elements for @xmath104 and @xmath105 are computed in a straightforward manner and the results are p | s_3 | p = - ( |c_1|^2 - |c_2|^2 ) - and p | t_33 | p = - ( |c_1|^2 - |c_2|^2 ) ( 1 + ) - .",
    "we find the same suppression factor @xmath106 for both the matrix elements .",
    "they have been included in relativistic quark model calculations such as in the bag and the chiral quark soliton models  @xcite .",
    "for the maximally relativistic case of massless quarks , it becomes 0.654 as in the mit bag model .",
    "accordingly , @xmath107 and @xmath108 = 1.09  @xcite .",
    "if we wish to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath0 we need a suppression factor of about 1/4 .",
    "this implies an unrealistically small value for @xmath109 .",
    "the inclusion of the asymptotic one pion contribution does not help very much ( see fig .  1 , as well as the discussions below ) .",
    "it increases @xmath1 about by 50 % @xcite , but still @xmath1 is only of the order of 0.6 .",
    "the skyrme model result @xmath110 is obtained when the suppression factor vanishes but in this case @xmath1 is also zero , which is inconsistent with the skyrme model .    next we consider the pionic effect on the @xmath2 quark state .",
    "this must be distinguished from the asymptotic one pion contribution from the tail region but is rather related to the finite range effect which generates the hedgehog structure through non - linear interactions in the large-@xmath2 limit ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we consider an ansatz of the direct product of the @xmath2 quarks and @xmath111 pions .",
    "the @xmath112 algebra can be realized in terms of the same type of operators as the quark algebra .",
    "since a pion carries spin one , the hedgehog form can be expressed as @xmath113 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "it is convenient to lump the quarks and pions together @xcite and write [ qandh ] |n_c;h_q + = ^n_c + 2n _ |0 .",
    "the meaning of the number of the pions is not very clear yet , but is related to how the nucleon spin is partitioned between quarks and pions . in a large-@xmath2 baryon where the bound state of @xmath2 quarks is treated in the hartree approximation",
    ", the number of the pions in the baryon would be expected to be proportional to @xmath2 , since in this approximation it is @xmath2 times the number of the pions around a single quark , which one expects to be of order one . in the following argument , however , @xmath2 and @xmath111 are treated as independent parameters in order to understand the results in what follows .",
    "now the nucleon matrix elements for @xmath114 and @xmath115 are computed in the same manner as before .",
    "note that those operators act directly on the @xmath2 quarks as illustrated in fig .",
    "the results are [ sqpi ] p | s_3 | p & = & - - , + [ tqpi ] p | t_33 | p & = & - ( 1 + ) - .",
    "these results have interesting implications . the nucleon spin @xmath0 becomes less than unity for a finite number of pions @xmath116 , where a part of the nucleon spin is carried by the angular momentum of pions .",
    "when @xmath117 , eq .",
    "( [ sqpi ] ) reduces to the quark model result , where the entire nucleon spin is carried by the quark spin , and when @xmath118 we obtain the skyrmion result , where the nucleon spin is entirely carried by the pion cloud  @xcite . the same thing holds also for the second term of @xmath1 in ( [ tqpi ] ) .",
    "in particular , the realization of the skyrme model results in the limit @xmath118 as shown here , rather than @xmath10 , is interesting .",
    "this result may be understood by interpreting the skyrme soliton as a coherent superposition of infinitely many pions . at this point",
    ", it is interesting to recall the recent result by dorey and mattis , who have explicitly shown that the skyrmion is an ultraviolet fixed point of a chiral bag model , where the coupling between the pion and the bare nucleon disappears  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the dynamics of the meson - baryon system is completely described by the pion alone .",
    "let us now try to make a rough estimate for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the physical nucleon , both effects , the relativity through the @xmath119 component and the pionic effects , must be considered .",
    "some algebra shows that this can be done by multiplying both ( [ sqpi ] ) and ( [ tqpi ] ) by the reduction factor @xmath120 .",
    "a reasonable estimate for this quantity is @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , @xmath1 of ( [ tqpi ] )",
    "becomes [ ga2 ] ~0.7 ( 1 + ) .",
    "the pion contribution as depicted in fig .",
    "1(b ) must still be added to this result . in the chiral limit",
    "this can be estimated to be about 50 % of the quark contribution of ( [ ga2 ] )  @xcite , and so we get for the total @xmath1 [ gatot ] & ~ & 1.5 0.7 ( 1 + ) ~(1 + ) .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath123 is then reproduced when @xmath124 .",
    "note that the @xmath5 correction term in ( [ gatot ] ) is about 30 % , which is in good agreement with the previously quoted numbers in the chiral quark soliton model and in the chiral bag model  @xcite .",
    "using the same parameters , the nucleon spin @xmath9 comes out to be ~0.7 ~0.3 .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that such a simple algebraic method can be used to describe both @xmath1 and @xmath9 simultaneously in good agreement with experiments .",
    "in this note we have investigated algebraic models that contain a subgroup @xmath12 whose contractions reduce to the large-@xmath2 algebra for qcd .",
    "we have explicitly constructed a realization which interpolates the skyrmion and the quark model results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in order to find such a result",
    "we were inspired by models to include explicit pionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the agreement of the present calculations with experiments and with previous model calculations suggests that those quantities are strongly governed by the underlying algebraic structure , rather than their detailed dynamical details , as also implied by the large-@xmath2 limit of qcd .",
