    "complex fluids frequently possess one or more frustrating interaction lengthscales that , regardless of origin , generate micro- to mesoscale structural heterogeneity .",
    "archetypical examples include microemulsions  @xcite , block copolymers  @xcite , confined fluids  @xcite , and colloidal dispersions , including proteins  @xcite , wherein the surfactant size , block length , pore size , and screened electrostatic repulsions set the respective length scales of frustration . despite their contextual differences , all exhibit similar transitions between homogeneous fluid states and emergent heterogeneous phases with density correlations characterized by intermediate range order ( iro ) , typically identified by the presence of a pre - peak at low but finite @xmath0 in the static structure factor @xmath1  @xcite .    in the case of a pore - glass confined binary fluid system  @xcite",
    ", the experimental emergence of iro has been rationalized via the behavior of the fluid thermal correlation length @xmath2 , which quantifies the range of correlated concentration fluctuations and the associated iro peak width in @xmath1 . in particular , it was demonstrated that the crossover in the temperature - density ( @xmath3 ) plane from dispersed fluid to strong iro corresponds to the conditions at which @xmath2 reaches the pore size , i.e. , the characteristic frustrating lengthscale .",
    "such conditions enable strong , preferential segregation of the wall - attracted species from the other component which , in turn , migrates into the pore centers . additionally , the iro ( @xmath3 ) crossover conditions corresponded to state points close to where the unconfined fluid reference system would otherwise exhibit liquid - liquid macrophase segregation .    here , we extend thermal correlation length concepts to a simple model system characterized by iro : the short - range attractive , long - range repulsive ( sl ) fluid , which mimics charge - stabilized colloids with van der waals , depletion , and/or hydrophobic attractions .",
    "various studies have demonstrated that the long - range repulsive interaction suppresses macrophase separation  which would occur for strong short - range attractions alone  in favor of iro structures including clusters  @xcite .",
    "however , an ongoing challenge has been to distinguish between generic iro ( i.e. , presence of _ any _ pre - peak ) and clustering specifically , particularly in a way accessible to experiments  @xcite .",
    "one such criterion  @xcite suggests that clustering emerges when the iro peak reaches a magnitude @xmath4 ; this bears similarity to the empirical hansen - verlet single - phase rule for tracing macroscopic freezing boundaries in simple fluids  @xcite .",
    "section ii presents the sl models under consideration and the simulation protocol and theoretical methodology used to characterize their behaviors . in section iii",
    "we propose a new conceptual framework and accurate criterion for clustering : namely , clusters form when the thermal correlation length @xmath5 encoded in the iro pre - peak of @xmath1 exceeds the characteristic lengthscale of the frustrating interparticle repulsive interaction .",
    "we find that this criterion also bolsters previously proposed connections between emergent iro in sl fluids and macroscopic phase separation in corresponding reference attractive ( ra ) models  @xcite lacking long - range repulsions .",
    "finally , we show that the criterion makes useful predictions for fluids that form either amorphous or micro - crystalline clusters , despite striking qualitative differences in the dynamic behaviors of these two types of systems .",
    "the paper concludes in section iv with a brief summary of our results and their relevance to experiment .",
    "various sl interaction models are known to exhibit iro ; here we consider a canonical example given by the pairwise potential  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a non - dimensionalized particle separation , @xmath8 is the measure of particle size , @xmath9 quantifies the attractive strength , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively characterize the repulsion magnitude and range .",
    "we set @xmath12 in eq .",
    "[ model:1 ] to mimic archetypical colloids governed by core repulsions with an attraction ranges of @xmath13 of the core diameter induced via depletant effects .",
    "the long - ranged yukawa tail mimics screened electrostatic interactions common to charge - stabilized suspensions .",
    "the corresponding ra potentials  @xcite are defined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the heaviside step function and @xmath16 is the nearest point for @xmath17 where @xmath18 is zero , which eliminates the repulsive tail .",
    "model sl fluids defined by eq .  [ model:1 ] can lose stability to micro - crystalline cluster phases at high attraction strengths  @xcite , in contrast to many experimental systems of interest ( e.g. , proteins ) that do not easily crystallize . to study the latter , we also examine a simple ternary mixture of sl particles designed to frustrate crystallization .",
    "the mixture pair potentials are described by @xmath19 ( x_{i , j}^{-2\\alpha } -x_{i , j}^{-\\alpha})+a \\dfrac{e^{-x_{i , j}/\\xi_{r}}}{x_{i , j}/\\xi_{r}}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the kronecker delta , @xmath21 correspond to small , medium ( @xmath22 ) , and large particles respectively , @xmath23 , and perturbative parameter shifts to interaction size and energy , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , help to thwart crystallization and promote mixing , respectively .",
    "we use systems comprising 20% small , 60% medium , and 20% large particles .",
    "this combination of @xmath26 and composition represents a three - component approximation of 10% polydispersity in particle size .    in examining both models , we set various combinations of the repulsive range @xmath11 and the thermally non - dimensionalized repulsive strength @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant ) while varying the non - dimensionalized attractive strength @xmath30 .",
    "this treatment mimics systems for which the short- and long - range aspects of constituent interactions are approximately orthogonal , such as colloids with screening lengths set by particle - solvent interactions and attractions tuned via introduction of depletants  @xcite .    to generate equilibrium particle configurations ,",
    "we perform 3d molecular dynamics simulations of @xmath31 particles interacting via eqns . 1 and 2 in the nvt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions using lammps  @xcite . due to the steepness of the repulsion",
    ", we use an integration time - step of @xmath32 , and due to the long - range repulsion , we include interactions out to a cut - off distance of @xmath33 . for all state points , the temperature is fixed at @xmath34 via a nos - hoover thermostat with time - constant @xmath35 .",
    "we calculate the structure factor @xmath1 from simulations by numerical fourier transform ( ft ) inversion of the radial distribution function @xmath36 . to determine whether state points are fluid , clustered , or percolating , we calculate cluster size distributions ( csds ) , which quantify the probabilistic formation of @xmath37-particle aggregates , where particles are considered part of the same aggregate if their centers are within the narrow range of the attractive well .",
    "similar to other studies  @xcite , a system is considered clustered with aggregates of preferred size @xmath38 by the presence of a _ local maxima _ in the csd at @xmath38 occurring in the range @xmath39 , and is considered percolated ( at the level of the box ) by a csd peak comprised of all particles , i.e. , @xmath40 .    to obtain analytical results for a broader range of potentials , we also derive theoretical thermodynamic and pair structure results via the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation relation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath36 is the radial distribution function , @xmath44 is the direct correlation function and @xmath45 is the number density . the oz relation is closed via the percus - yevick hard sphere reference , non - linear optimized random phase approximation , @xmath46 - 1+g(r)$ ] , where @xmath47 for @xmath48 while for @xmath49 it is optimized to enforce @xmath50 ( thus , we approximate eqn .",

    "in contrast , for the ra fluids lacking long - range repulsions , the short - range attractions drive ordering on the macroscopic lengthscale , corresponding to the peak at @xmath62 .",
    "crucially , we see that for the very weak repulsive case ( @xmath52 , @xmath63 ) , the @xmath1 for the sl fluid traces the ra curve down to low-@xmath0 , supporting the conceptual notion of sl fluids as perturbations to underlying ra fluids for which only the principal ordering lengthscale has been shifted .    to understand why one should naturally expect sl fluids to aggregate on smaller lengthscales than their ra counterparts , we examine in fig .",

    "2(a ) , we catalog the phase behavior as a function of attractive strength @xmath30 for various packing fractions @xmath80 .",
    "it is evident that for the lower - density isochores , the @xmath81 criterion demarcates when clustering begins in our polydisperse system , as indicated by a characteristic csd peak with increasing attractions ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) and reflected by a growing iro pre - peak in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "as is intuitively expected and seen by others  @xcite , for denser isochores like @xmath82 , it is challenging to identify precisely when `` clustering '' begins because the csd indicates box - wide percolation ( geometrically merged clusters ) even down to relatively low @xmath30 .",
    "2(a ) also shows that correlation lengths of monodisperse and polydisperse systems coincide upon approach to the @xmath68 threshold , where this boundary also approximately identifies where the monodisperse fluid loses stability with respect to formation of micro - crystalline clusters .    in fig .",

    "3(a - b ) , we examine two potentials with different repulsive strengths : for @xmath85 , the repulsion is evidently `` strong '' and there is no overlap between the @xmath68 and ra spinodal boundaries ( note : this highlights that these boundaries do not generally overlap as in fig .",
    "however , as repulsion strength is lowered to @xmath86 , the two curves collapse and become truly indistinguishable , reflecting a deep sl - ra connection . in fig .",

    "clear discrepancies in shape are apparent when comparing the ra spinodals and the @xmath88 boundaries , and the two types of curves increasingly move apart as @xmath27 is reduced .",

    "the intimate correspondence between the sl boundaries and the ra spinodal further reflects that the condition @xmath68 reflects a muted thermodynamic instability , which for very weak repulsions can also emerge within the sl fluid itself .     with attractive strength @xmath92 and repulsions defined by @xmath54 and @xmath93 .",

    "clusters in the former exhibit amorphous and irregular shapes , as exemplified by the simulation snapshots in fig .",
    "4(a ) , which correspond to the system in fig . 2 at conditions slightly above the clustering transition .",
    "here , it is evident based on the time - lag snapshots that the clusters are transient and continuously redistribute particles to create new clusters at the expense of others . by significantly increasing the attractive strength @xmath30 , one can eventually observe arrested , percolating , amorphous gels as exemplified by the simulation snapshots for @xmath51 systems in fig .",
    "interestingly , our model gels may be thermoreversible with no local crystallinity , possibly providing a simpler alternative to valence - limited gel - formers  @xcite .",
    "thermoreversibility is highly desired to facilitate fabrication of massively reconfigurable , reversible materials .",
    "in contrast , monodisperse systems at similar attraction strengths can undergo highly regular clustering via local crystallization , as exemplified in figure 4(b ) .",
    "while the crystalline nature of such simulated clusters has been observed previously by others  @xcite , we do note that the relatively weaker repulsion examined here drives formation of much larger clusters that are more obviously crystalline in nature .",
    "the crystalline clusters are relatively static objects once formed , as demonstrated by the time - lag snapshots , in direct contrast to the amorphous clusters .     with various attractive strengths @xmath30 and repulsions defined by @xmath54 and @xmath93 .",
    "in all snapshots , particles comprising a single cluster ( determined at time @xmath94 ) are rendered opaque in their positions at time @xmath94 . for cases ( a ) and ( b ) that are not gelled , the same particles are also shown in their positions at @xmath95 .",

    "in closing , we have presented a new framework for understanding and detecting cluster phases in sl fluids based on the thermal correlation length @xmath5 .",
    "this framework should prove useful for probing micro - structural transitions in diverse systems governed by frustrated interactions , e.g. , lattice spin models with opposing nearest - neighbor and higher - order couplings .",
    "we have also presented the first non - microcrystallizing sl fluid , which exhibits amorphous transient clusters ; this should prove useful for examining the ( zeroth order ) physics of real dispersions known to be resistant to crystallization , e.g. , proteins .",
    "finally , we remark that the @xmath68 clustering criterion can be implemented in experiments provided that , in addition to extracting @xmath5 from an @xmath1 profile ( described earlier ) , one can also obtain a reasonable measure of the repulsive lengthscale between particles @xmath11 . for systems accurately described by simple screening models ,",
    "@xmath11 can be directly estimated .",
    "otherwise , one can first obtain the @xmath100-space total correlation function @xmath101 via an inverse ft of @xmath1 .",

    "one directly compares the range of interparticle correlations ( as captured by @xmath5 ) and the characteristic range of the interparticle interactions , respectively .",
