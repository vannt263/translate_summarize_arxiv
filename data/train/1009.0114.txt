    "topological phases have become an important object of study in both condensed matter physics and quantum computation .",
    "condensed matter theorists have proposed that certain many - electron systems confined to two dimensions may support topological phases .",
    "for example , it is widely suspected that the low energy behavior of certain fractional quantum hall systems is described by the @xmath4 topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) for various @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the world lines of @xmath1 particles confined to two dimensions trace out a braid as the particles are exchanged .",
    "the induced transformation on a @xmath6-fold degenerate ground space is a @xmath6-dimensional unitary representation of the braid group @xmath7 .",
    "if the representation is anything other than the trivial or sign representations , the particles are called anyons . in general",
    ", the representation could be reducible . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to calculate the dimension of the irreducible subspaces .",
    "these have a physical interpretation .",
    "each @xmath0 tqft has a finite set of anyon types . if multiple anyons are bound together and treated as a unit , they behave collectively as another type from this set . if we take all @xmath1 anyons and fuse them together , the type of the resulting single anyon indexes the irreducible subspace in which the system lies .",
    "braiding and recoupling of anyons can not move the system from one irreducible subspace to another . as discussed in section [ setup ] , for @xmath0",
    "the irreducible subspaces are indexed by a restricted class of young diagrams .",
    "in many cases , the dimensions of the irreducible subspaces grow exponentially with @xmath1 . to those interested in quantum computing , the exponentially large state space ,",
    "nonlocal degrees of freedom , and energy gap all make topological phases promising candidates for fault - tolerant quantum memories .",
    "furthermore , by adiabatically braiding the @xmath8 anyons around each other , one can in principle do universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "this result has been extended to @xmath0 for all @xmath9 and all @xmath10 other than four @xcite .",
    "the universality results all depend on exponentially large degeneracy .",
    "the representation of the braid group corresponding to @xmath0 also produces a topological invariant of knots and links called the single - variable homfly polynomial at the @xmath11 root of unity . @xmath12 yields the jones polynomial as a special case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mansour and severini give an exact closed formula for the dimensions of the irreducible subspaces for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the result was obtained combinatorically by counting paths in the bratteli diagrams .",
    "the present work studies @xmath13 by similar techniques . with these parameters",
    "the problem appears more difficult . after introducing the problem",
    ", we write a form for the generating function for the dimensions of the irreducible subspaces .",
    "we then obtain explicit formulas in some special cases .",
    "giving a general closed formula remains an open question .",
    "a _ young diagram _ is a partition of @xmath1 boxes into rows , such that no row is longer than the row above it .",
    "standard young tableau _ is a young diagram in which the @xmath1 boxes have been numbered from @xmath14 to @xmath1 .",
    "the numbers in any column must increase downward and the numbers in any row must increase from left to right .",
    "we can interpret these numbers as instructions for building the young diagram by adding one box at a time , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "[ htbp ]        the condition that numbers must increase rightward and downward is equivalent to the condition that the configuration obtained after the addition of each box must always be a valid young diagram . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the ground space of a topological phase corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath1 quasiparticles separates into invariant subspaces .",
    "braiding and recoupling of the quasiparticles can not move the system from one invariant subspace to another .",
    "these subspaces correspond to the different young diagrams of @xmath1 boxes @xmath15 rows such that the number of boxes in the first row minus the number of boxes in the @xmath16 row is at most @xmath5 . for the @xmath0 tqft , the dimension @xmath6 of the subspace with an @xmath1-box young diagram",
    "@xmath17 is equal to the number of young tableaux of shape @xmath17 such that the configuration obtained after adding each box is not only a valid young diagram , but also has the property that the number of boxes in the first row minus the number of boxes in the @xmath16 row is at most @xmath5 .",
    "a 3-row young tableau can be characterized by three numbers : @xmath1 , the total number of boxes , @xmath18 , the overhang of the top row over the middle row , and @xmath19 , the overhang of the middle row over the bottom row . for @xmath13 , @xmath20 is restricted to lie within the set @xmath21 of pairs of nonnegative integers such that @xmath22 . in figure",
    "[ d3 ] , we construct a graph @xmath23 on the vertices @xmath24 . each vertex @xmath20 is illustrated with an example of a young diagram with the corresponding set of overhangs . a directed edge from @xmath20 to @xmath25",
    "is included if one can go from a young diagram with overhangs @xmath20 to a young diagram with overhangs @xmath25 by adding one box .",
    "the @xmath1-box young tableaux of shape @xmath17 allowed for @xmath13 correspond bijectively to the paths on the graph @xmath26 starting from @xmath27 and ending after @xmath1 steps on the vertex corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , a _ path _ of length @xmath1 in @xmath28 is a sequence of vertices @xmath29 and edges @xmath30 .",
    "a path can contain more than a single occurrence of the same vertex .",

    "@xmath31 is equal to the dimension of the invariant subspace of @xmath1 @xmath13 anyons whose young diagram has overhangs @xmath20 .",
