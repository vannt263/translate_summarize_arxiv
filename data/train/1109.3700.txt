    "the problem of signification of each focal element is the same as in @xmath2 .",

    ", we will note @xmath12 for either @xmath2 or @xmath10 .    in order to try to quantify the measure of uncertainty such as in the set theory @xcite or in the theory of probabilities @xcite ,",
    "some measures have been proposed and discussed in the theory of belief functions @xcite .",
    "however , the domain of definition of the bba does not allow an ideal definition of measure of uncertainty .",
    "moreover , behind the term of uncertainty , different notions are hidden .    in the section [ measureuncertainty ] ,",
    "we present different kinds of measures of uncertainty given in the state of art , we discuss them and give our definitions of some terms concerning the uncertainty . in section",
    "[ contradiction ] , we introduce a measure of contradiction and discuss it .",
    "we introduce simple degrees of uncertainty in the section [ degreesuncer ] , and propose a degree of specificity in the section [ degreespecificity ] .",
    "we show how this degree of specificity can be used to measure the specificity of a combination rule .",
    "in the framework of the belief functions , several functions ( we call them _ belief functions _ ) are in one to one correspondence with the bba : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . from these belief functions",
    ", we can define several measures of uncertainty .",
    "klir in @xcite distinguishes two kinds of uncertainty : the non - specificity and the discord .",
    "hence , we recall hereafter the main belief functions , and some non - specificity and discord measures .      hence , the credibility and plausibility functions represent respectively a minimal and maximal belief .",
    "the _ credibility _",
    "function is given from a bba for all @xmath16 by : @xmath17 the _ plausibility _ is given from a bba for all @xmath16 by : @xmath18 the _ commonality _ function is also another belief function given by : @xmath19 these functions allow an implicit model of imprecise and uncertain data .",
    "however , these functions are monotonic by inclusion : @xmath13 and @xmath14 are increasing , and @xmath15 is decreasing .",
    "this is the reason why the most of time we use a probability to take a decision .",
    "the most used projection into probability subspace is the pignistic probability transformation introduced by @xcite and given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cardinality of @xmath6 , in the case of the dsmt that is the number of disjoint elements corresponding in the venn diagram .    from this probability",
    ", we can use the measure of uncertainty given in the theory of probabilities such as the shannon entropy @xcite , but we loose the interest of the belief functions and the information given on the subsets of the discernment space @xmath0 .      the non - specificity in the classical set theory is the imprecision of the sets . such as in @xcite , we define in the theory of belief functions , the non - specificity related to vagueness and non - specificity .    * definition * _",
    "the _ non - specificity _ in the theory of belief functions quantifies how a bba @xmath1 is imprecise . _",
    "the non - specificity of a subset @xmath6 is defined by hartley @xcite by @xmath22 .",
    "this measure was generalized by @xcite in the theory of belief functions by : @xmath23 that is a weighted sum of the non - specificity , and the weights are given by the basic belief in @xmath6 .",
    "ramer in @xcite has shown that it is the unique possible measure of non - specificity in the theory of belief functions under some assumptions such as symmetry , additivity , sub - additivity , continuity , branching and normalization .",
    "if the measure of the non - specificity on a bba is low , we can consider the bba is specific .",
    "yager in @xcite defined a specificity measure such as : @xmath24    both definitions corresponded to an accumulation of a function of the basic belief assignment on the focal elements .",
    "unlike the classical set theory , we must take into account the bba in order to quantify ( to weight ) the belief of the imprecise focal elements .",
    "the imprecision of a focal element can of course be given by the cardinality of the element .",
    "first of all , we must be able to compare the non - specificity ( or specificity ) between several bba s , event if these bba s are not defined on the same discernment space .",
    "that is not the case with the equations and .",
    "the non - specificity of the equation takes its values in @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the specificity of the equation can have values in @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "we will show how we can easily define a degree of non - specificity in @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "we could also define a degree of specificity from the equation ( [ speyager ] ) , but that is more complicated and we will later show how we can define a specificity degree .",
    "the most non - specific bba s for both equations and are the total ignorance bba given by the categorical bba @xmath27 .",
    "we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this categorical bba is clearly the most non - specific for us .",
    "however , the most specific bba s are the bayesian bba s",
    ". the only focal elements of a bayesian bba are the simple elements of @xmath0 . on these kinds of bba @xmath1",
    "we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "for example , we take the three bayesian bba s defined on @xmath32 by : @xmath33 we obtain the same non - specificity and specificity for these three bba s .",
    "that hurts our intuition ; indeed , we intuitively expect that the bba @xmath34 is the most specific and the @xmath35 is the less specific .",
    "we will define a degree of specificity according to a most specific bba that we will introduce .",
    "different kinds of discord have been defined as extensions for belief functions of the shannon entropy , given for the probabilities .",
    "some discord measures have been proposed from plausibility , credibility or pignistic probability : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we can also give the shanon entropy on the pignistic probability : @xmath40 other measures have been proposed , @xcite has shown that these measures can be resumed by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is called a conflict measure of the bba @xmath1 on @xmath6 . however , in our point of view that is not a conflict such presented in @xcite , but a contradiction .",
    "we give the both following definitions :    * definition * _ a _ contradiction _ in the theory of belief functions quantifies how a bba @xmath1 contradicts itself .",
    "_    * definition * ( c1 ) _ the _ conflict _ in the theory of belief functions can be defined by the contradiction between 2 or more bba s . _    in order to measure the conflict in the theory of belief functions , it was usual to use the mass @xmath43 given by the conjunctive combination rule on the empty set .",
    "this rule is given by two basic belief assignments @xmath35 and @xmath44 and for all @xmath16 by : @xmath45 @xmath46 can also be interpreted as a non - expected solution .    in @xcite ,",
    "yager proposed another conflict measure from the value of @xmath43 given by @xmath47 .",
    "however , as observed in @xcite , the weight of conflict given by @xmath43 ( and all the functions of @xmath43 ) is not a conflict measure between the basic belief assignments .",
    "indeed this value is completely dependant of the conjunctive rule and this rule is non - idempotent - the combination of identical basic belief assignments leads generally to a positive value of @xmath43 . to highlight this behavior ,",
    "we defined in @xcite the _ auto - conflict _ which quantifies the intrinsic conflict of a bba .",
    "the auto - conflict of order @xmath48 for one expert is given by : @xmath49 the auto - conflict is a kind of measure of the contradiction , but depends on the order .",
    "we studied its behavior in @xcite .",
    "therefore we need to define a measure of contradiction independent on the order .",
    "this measure is presented in the next section [ contradiction ] .",
    "the definition of the conflict ( c1 ) involves firstly to measure it on the bba s space and secondly that if the opinions of two experts are far from each other , we consider that they are in conflict .",
    "that suggests a notion of distance . that is the reason why in @xcite",
    ", we give a definition of the measure of conflict between experts assertions through a distance between their respective bba s . the conflict measure between @xmath50 experts",
    "is defined by : @xmath51 we defined the conflict measure between one expert @xmath52 and the other @xmath53 experts by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the set of experts in conflict with @xmath52 .",
    "another definition is given by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bba of the artificial expert representing the combined opinions of all the experts in @xmath58 except @xmath52 .",
    "we use the distance defined in @xcite , which is for us the most appropriate , but other distances are possible . see @xcite for a comparison of distances in the theory of belief functions .",
    "this distance is defined for two basic belief assignments @xmath59 and @xmath60 on @xmath12 by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an @xmath63 matrix based on jaccard distance whose elements are : @xmath64    however , this measure is a _ total conflict _ measure . in order to define a contradiction measure we keep the same spirit .",
    "first , the contradiction of an element @xmath6 with respect to a bba @xmath1 is defined as the distance between the bba s @xmath1 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , @xmath16 , is the categorical bba : @xmath67 where the distance can also be the jousselme distance on the bba s .",
    "the contradiction of a bba is then defined as a weighted contradiction of all the elements @xmath6 of the considered space @xmath12 : @xmath68    where @xmath69 is a normalized constant which depends on the type of distance used and on the cardinality of the frame of discernment in order to obtain values in @xmath3 $ ] as shown in the following illustration .      here",
    "the value @xmath69 in the equation is equal to 2 .",
    "first we note that for all categorical bbas @xmath70 , the contradiction given by the equation gives @xmath71 and the contradiction given by the equation brings also @xmath72 . considering the bba @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 . that is the maximum of the contradiction , hence the contraction of a bba takes its values in @xmath3 $ ] .",
