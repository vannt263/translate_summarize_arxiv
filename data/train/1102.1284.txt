    "since the first experimental realization more than one decade ago of two - cycle optical pulses in mode - locked ti - sapphire lasers using double - chirped mirrors @xcite-@xcite the field of few - cycle pulses ( fcps ) has grown into one of the major area of modern ultrafast optics .",
    "these studies led to remarkable achievements in the field of extreme nonlinear optics , time - resolved laser spectroscopy , generation of soft x - ray radiation and isolated and controlled attosecond light pulses in the extreme ultraviolet regime , thereby opening the door for real - time probing of fast electron dynamics associated with excited - state atomic and molecular processes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these fcps are key elements to many time - domain applications , driving the quest for stable mode - locked laser sources with ultrahigh spectral bandwitdth .",
    "a remarkable recent advance in this area was the syntesis of a single cycle of light in the near - infrared regime with compact erbium - doped fiber technology @xcite .",
    "another recent achievement is the possibility to use different optical parameter amplifiers to produce fcps over a broad frequency range .",
    "the optical parametric chirped pulse amplification method has become one of the standard procedures to generate high peak power pulses with durations of a few optical cycles .",
    "two- and three - cycle pulses with carrier wavelengths almost continuously tunable from visible to mid - infrared were recently generated @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical arena the studies of the unique physics of fcps concentrated on three main directions : ( i ) the quantum approach @xcite , ( ii ) the refinements within the framework of the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) of the nonlinear schrdinger - type envelope equations @xcite , and non - svea models @xcite . in kerr - like media the physics of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional fcps can be adequately described beyond the svea by using different dynamical models , such as the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) @xcite , sine - gordon ( sg ) @xcite , or mkdv - sg equations @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned evolution equations admit breather solutions , which are most suitable for describing the physics of few - optical - cycle solitons .",
    "notice that other non - svea models @xcite , especially the so - called short - pulse equation @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "moreover , a non - integrable generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation @xcite ( a two - dimensional version of the mkdv model ) was also put forward for describing the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional few - optical - cycle spatiotemporal soliton propagation in cubic nonlinear media beyond the svea  @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that collapse of fcps occurs for high enough intensities in the frame of cubic generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili model , which describes ultrashort spatiotemporal optical pulse propagation in cubic ( kerr - like ) media @xcite .",
    "notice that of particular interest for the physics of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional fcps is the mkdv - sg equation ; thus by using a system of two - level atoms , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the propagation of ultrashort pulses in kerr optical media is fairly well described by a generic mkdv - sg equation , which was also derived and studied in refs .",
    "recently , we showed that the mkdv - sg model is the most general of all approximate non - svea models for fcps , and in fact contains all of them @xcite .",
    "also , the propagation of single - cycle gap solitons in subwavelength periodic structures , without the use of the svea of the maxwell - bloch equations has also been theoretically predicted in a recent study  @xcite .    as concerning the physical assumptions made in order to get the above mentioned generic nonlinear evolution equations we first mention that soliton propagation implies that damping can be neglected .",
    "in dielectric media , this occurs far from any resonance frequency .",
    "let us consider a two - level model with characteristic frequency @xmath0 , and denote by @xmath1 a frequency characteristic for the fcp soliton under consideration .",
    "the transparency condition implies that either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the former case ( @xmath2 ) corresponds to the _ long wave approximation _ , whereas the latter case corresponds to the _ short wave approximation_. in the frame of a two - level model , a mkdv equation is obtained if the frequency of the transition @xmath0 is far above the characteristic wave frequency @xmath1 ( the long - wave approximation regime ) , while a sg model is valid if @xmath0 is much smaller than @xmath1 ( the short - wave approximation regime ) .",
    "however , some of the transitions frequencies @xmath4 are much smaller than @xmath1 , and the other ones much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this more realistic situation can be modeled by considering two transitions only , with different frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the physical system is thus equivalent to a two - component medium , each of the two components being described by a two - level model . as a result",
    ", a mkdv - sg model was put forward @xcite , which is completely integrable in certain particular cases by means of the inverse scattering transform .",
    "it admits stable solutions of breather type , which also give a good description of few - optical - cycle soliton propagation .",
    "the propagation of fcps in a quadratic medium has also been described by either a kdv or a kp equation , in ( 1 + 1 ) or ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , respectively , which evidenced either the stability of a plane wavefront , for a normal dispersion , or the formation of a localized spatiotemporal half - cycle soliton , for an anomalous dispersion @xcite . by using a multiscale analysis , a generic kp evolution equation governing the propagation of femtosecond spatiotemporal optical solitons in quadratic nonlinear media beyond the svea",
    "was recently put forward @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations showed the formation , from adequately chosen few - cycle input pulses , of both stable line solitons ( in the case of a quadratic medium with normal dispersion ) and of stable lumps ( for a quadratic medium with anomalous dispersion ) . the perturbed unstable line solitons decay into stable lumps for a quadratic nonlinear medium with anomalous dispersion @xcite .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered a set of two - level atoms and we have assumed that the characteristic frequency @xmath1 of the considered electromagnetic wave in the optical spectral range is much less than the transition frequency @xmath0 of the atoms , i.e. , we worked in the so - called long - wave approximation regime .    summarizing , in the _ long wave approximation _",
    ", for a quadratic nonlinearity , half - cycle light bullets in the form of a single lump may exist , while for a cubic nonlinearity collapse occurs . in the present work",
    "we will show that in the _ short wave approximation _ for a cubic nonlinearity , a third physical situation occurs : few - cycle light bullets may form , oscillating in both space and time .    more precisely ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a generic partial differential equation describing the dynamics of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spatiotemporal solitons beyond the svea model equations in the so - called short - wave approximation regime , when we consider the situation in which the resonance frequency @xmath0 of the two - level atoms is below the characteristic optical frequency @xmath1 .",
    "several generalizations to ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions of the sg equation exist in the literature and can be derived in the short - wave approximation ; some of them support localized solitons which are not oscillating as the sg breather and one - dimensional fcp solitons in kerr media  @xcite .",
    "the question whether the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional generalization of sg equation , which is valid for fcp propagation in cubic nonlinear media , is one of the nonlinear dynamical systems discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite or some other one , can only be decided by means of a rigorous derivation starting from the basic equations .",
    "we use a reductive perturbation method ( multiscale analysis ) @xcite and as a result we get a generic two - dimensional sine - gordon ( 2d sg ) equation to describe the propagation of ultrashort ( 2 + 1)-dimensional light bullets in a system of two - level atoms beyond the svea .",
    "this is the first result of the present work .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the 2d sg equation governing the propagation of femtosecond spatiotemporal solitons beyond the svea .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the 2d sg nonlinear partial differential equation are given in sec .",
    "iii , where it is shown the generation of stable ( 2 + 1)-dimensional fcps from perturbed fcp plane waves .",
    "this is the second result of this paper .",
    "we note that a numerical resolution of the 2d sg equation was published in an earlier work @xcite , which showed the existence of ultrashort light bullets .",
    "however , it was believed that their amplitudes were not constant but decreased during propagation .",
    "we prove numerically that this decay is only a transient feature corresponding to a reshaping of the input , and that a stable steady - state do exist .",
    "in other words we prove that the localized pulse of ref .",
    "@xcite is really an ultrashort light bullet .",

    "section iv presents our conclusions .",
    "we consider a set of two - level atoms with the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the frequency of the transition .",
    "the evolution of the electric field @xmath9 is described by the wave equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the polarization density .",
    "the light propagation is coupled with the medium by means of a dipolar electric momentum @xmath12 directed along the same direction @xmath13 as the electric field , according to @xmath14 and the polarization density @xmath11 along the @xmath13-direction is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume density of atoms and @xmath17 the density matrix .",
    "since , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relaxation terms containing the relaxation times for both the level populations and coherences can be neglected , due to the fact that the relaxation occurs very slowly with regard to optical oscilations .",
    "thus the density - matrix evolution equation ( schrdinger equation ) reduces to @xmath18.\\label{schr}\\label{eq19}\\ ] ]    transparency implies that the characteristic frequency @xmath1 of the considered radiation ( in the optical range ) strongly differs from the resonance frequency @xmath0 of the atoms . here",
    "we consider the so - called short - wave approximation , by assuming that @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "hence @xmath0 is small , which can be expressed as @xmath19 @xmath20 being a small parameter .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the time unit in the basic equations according to ( [ omeg ] ) , and hence we set @xmath21 and analogously for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",

    "however , the physical interpretation of the approximation and its link to the standard short - wave approximation as defined in @xcite would be much less clear .",
    "the delayed time @xmath31 involves propagation at some speed @xmath32 to be determined .",
    "it is assumed to vary rapidly in time according to the assumption @xmath33 .",
    "this motivates the introduction of the variables @xmath34 the pulse shape described by the variable @xmath31 evolves more slowly in time , the corresponding scale being that of variable @xmath35 .",
    "the transverse spatial variable @xmath36 has an intermediate scale , comparable to what is usually considered in long - wave approximations @xcite .    next we use the reductive perturbation method as developed in ref .",

    "the 2d sg equation was also derived from the maxwell - bloch equations , but the derivation was performed from a reduced form of the maxwell - bloch equations , and the physical assumptions were not so cleary given .",
    "we thus proved in the present work that the short wave approximation of the maxwell - bloch equations is indeed the 2d sg equation , and not one of the nonlinear system of equations found in the study of nonlinear electromagnetic waves in ferromagnets @xcite . still in ref .",
    "@xcite , a nonlinear schrdinger - type equation with higher order nonlinear terms was derived from 2d sg , and it was shown that the latter saturates the nonlinearity and may arrest collapse .",
    "light bullets were also simulated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , but on a rather short propagation distance ; it was stated in that work that the light bullets loose energy and will become destroyed eventually . however , according to our computations on propagation distances 20 times larger than in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which stabilization of the energy occurs , the energy loss seems rather to be due to the reshaping of the input pulse , and the light bullet is expected to have an infinite duration .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the robustness of the light bullets during collisions was shown .",
    "the 2d sg equation was written in the form which allows propagation in both directions ( in contrast , what we got here is the one - directional form of the 2d sg equation ) , and the inputs were either counterpropagating or colliding at a large angle @xcite .",

    "in summary , we have introduced a generic model beyond the slowly varying envelope approximation of the nonlinear schrdinger - type evolution equations , for describing the propagation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spatiotemporal ultrashort optical solitons in two - level media . in the case of resonant nonlinearities , the short - wave approximation allow us to obtain a two - dimensional model generalizing the sine - gordon equation .",
    "the use of the multiscale expansion up to the second - order in a certain small perturbation parameter allowed us to give a rigorous derivation of this equation , and more precisely to prove that the nonlinear partial differential equation obtained in this paper is different from the previously known two - dimensional generalizations of sine - gordon equation , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the two - dimensional generalization of the sine - gordon equation show that stable ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ultrashort light bullets may form spontaneously from a transversely perturbed input plane wave , in the few - cycle regime .",
    "thus the stability of light bullets has been demonstrated , in contrast with a previous reported result @xcite .",
    "the present study can be generalized by taking into account both resonant and non - resonant optical nonlinearities .",
    "moreover , the generalization to two transverse spatial dimensions , in addition to time and longitudinal coordinates , in order to study the formation of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional few - optical - cycle light bullets @xcite can also be envisaged ."
