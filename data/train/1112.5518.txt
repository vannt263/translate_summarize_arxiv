    "the physico - chemical features and soluble properties of water are of the central importance for life on our planet . however , despite of a knowledge of some properties at the ambient conditions that corresponds only to narrow part of water phase diagram , the inherent structural and dynamical properties are still far from to be completely understood , that motivates to perform a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations of water @xcite .",
    "water is known as a system with a rich variety of anomalous behavior related with the different phase states .",
    "for example , in a solid state , water has at least fifteen crystalline forms , where four of these can coexist with the liquid phase , and a variety of the amorphous phases known as amorphous ices and polyamorphism @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting features of water is related with the first - order like phase transition from low - density liquid ( ldl ) state to high - density liquid ( hdl ) state was reported in ref .",
    "the hypothesis of a `` liquid - liquid phase transition '' in water was considered in a series of experimental , computational and theoretical studies ( see , for example , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as it was found , the difference between these liquid states is mainly provided by the structural properties .",
    "namely , in the hdl , the local tetrahedrally coordinated hydrogen bond ( hb ) structure is not fully developed , whereas in the ldl , a more open , locally `` ice - like '' hb network is realized @xcite .",
    "both these liquid states are closely associated with the two amorphous phases observed experimentally in water : the low - density amorphous ( lda ) and the high - density amorphous ( hda ) ices , although locus of this `` transition '' is still debatable @xcite .",
    "remarkably , that a sharp jump in density ( volume ) is smoothed with the increase of temperature ( or the decrease of pressure ) and disappears completely , while ldl / hdl structural transformations still exists .",
    "it is interesting to note that the amorphous phase of water is also characterized by the `` transition '' from hda ice to very high - density amorphous ( vhda ) ice @xcite . a schematic phase diagram of water , that treats qualitatively some empirical results , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_phased ] . above the critical temperature of the predicted ldl / hdl transition , the jump in volume ( density )",
    "is absent , but the local structure changes completely with pressure .",
    "this is clear detected by the radial distribution function ( for example , for oxygen atoms ) , @xmath8 , where the first minimum disappears , while the second maximum and minimum changes by a minimum and maximum , respectively ( see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_phased ] ) .",
    "it is significant to note that although a schematic phase diagram of water is known in general sense for an extensive ( @xmath4,@xmath5)-range ( see , for example , fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite and fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the exact boundary location between ldl and hdl is not well - defined as well as the smoothed ldl / hdl transformations range are still undetected .",
    "so , the problem associated with the structural transformation and its influence on microscopic dynamics of liquid water ( even at the room temperature ) requires the additional studies @xcite .",
    "the given work studies the structural features within first two coordiantion shells @xcite as well as the vibrational properties of liquid water at the temperature @xmath2  k and a wide range of pressure by means of molecular dynamics simulations on the basis of the amoeba interaction potential .",
    "the correlation between structural features of the transformation and molecular vibrational dynamics of water is also considered .",

    "the manifestation of the effect of the structural transformations on the vibrational properties of water and the possible correlation between these both are also discussed here .",
    "finally , we conclude with a short summary .",
    "equilibrium classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of water at the constant temperature @xmath2  k and the different pressures were performed on the basis of the amoeba  atm the maximum in density at the temperature @xmath2  k instead of the well - known value @xmath12  k @xcite .",
    "actually , one notices that the amoeba potential does not reproduce the experimental equation of state correctly : for instance , the density @xmath13 @xmath14 at @xmath15  k is reached at @xmath16  atm in the present simulation , instead of @xmath17  atm in the experiment . ]",
    "( atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications ) water model suggested recently by ren and ponder @xcite .",
    "the model uses a polarizable atomic multipole description of electrostatic interactions , where the polarization is treated due to the self - consistent induced atomic dipoles @xcite , and a modified version of the thole s interaction model is used to damp the induction at a short range @xcite .",
    "our computations were performed for @xmath18 water molecules interacted within a cubic box with the periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "the ewald summation was used to handle the electrostatic interactions .",
    "moreover , an atom - based switching window of the size 12   was applied to cut off the van der waals interactions .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated via a modified beeman algorithm @xcite , @xmath19 with the time step @xmath20  fs .",
    "the isothermal - isobaric ensemble at the temperature @xmath2  k and the pressure @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath16 , @xmath27 and @xmath28   atm was applied by means of the berendsen thermostat and barostat  @xcite . according to this scheme , to enforce the constant temperature the system",
    "was weakly coupled to a heat bath with some temperature .",
    "the velocities were scaled at an each step by such a way , that the rate of the temperature change is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coupling parameter , which determines how tightly the bath and the system are coupled together , @xmath31 is the temperature of the external heat bath .",
    "this method provides an exponential decay of the system temperature towards the desired value .",
    "the change in temperature between the successive time steps is @xmath32 here @xmath33 the instantaneous value of the temperature ; @xmath34 is the number of constraints and @xmath35 is the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the scaling factor for the velocities is @xmath36 within the berendsen barostat the system is made to obey the equation of motion @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the value of the applied pressure , @xmath4 is the instantaneous system pressure . in the isotropic case ,",
    "the box volume is scaled by a factor @xmath39 , whereas the coordinates are scaled by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the isothermal compressibility of the system .",
    "the value of the coupling parameter @xmath30 in our simulations was equal to 0.1 ps .",
    "a central place at the study of any phase transition or structural transformations takes the consideration of the equation of states . here",
    ", the equation of state was defined for the considered water model at the fixed temperature @xmath2  k and different pressures .",
    "results are shown in fig .",

    "the obtained equation allows one to find directly the isothermal compressibility @xmath49 as @xmath50    there is no any visible singularity in the density @xmath43 as well as in the isothermal compressibility @xmath51 ( see inset of fig .",

    "contrary to the isothermal compressibility @xmath49 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_eos ] ) , which has a nonlinear monotonic decrease with pressure , the local isothermal compressibility @xmath11 demonstrates a significant jump at the pressure @xmath63 atm .",
    "a peculiarity in the vicinity of this value of pressure is also clear observed for the difference @xmath64 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_isoloc ] , although it is not so obvious in the dependencies @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "such result is a direct evidence that the structural transformations from ldl to hdl in water at the pressure @xmath63 atm are related with the structural rearrangement within the second coordination shell .",
    "then , the next question arises naturally : have these structural transformations an influence on the inherent microscopic dynamics ? one of the simplest way to answer on",
    "the question is to consider the vibrational density of states of the system .",

    "[ fig_vdos ] presents the defined vdos of liquid water at the different pressures and the fixed temperature @xmath2  k. as can be seen , vdos has a bimodal form for all the cases .",
    "it is remarkable that the high - frequency peak position in vdos is independent on pressure whereas the low - frequency peak changes both the intensity and the position @xmath70 .",
    "as can be see from the pressure dependence of @xmath70 given in inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_vdos ] , the quantity @xmath70 has a non - monotonic step - like behavior in vicinity of the characteristic value of pressure @xmath63 atm .",
    "this indicates on the correlation of the low - frequency molecular vibrational properties with the structural transformations at the pressure . while high - frequency mode corresponds to the inherent vibrational processes of the molecules , the time scale @xmath71 is related with the vibrational dynamics of the molecular conglomerates @xcite .",
    "the immediate correlation of the low - frequency vibrations with the structural transformations at the local spatial scales in the range of the second coordination shell can be directly seen from inset ( b ) of fig .",

    "the low - frequency mode can be attributed to the vibrational motions of the separate molecular tetrahedral complexes .",
    "so , one can concluded that the pressure - induced changes in the low - frequency mode is governed by the change of geometry of the local molecular conglomerates formed by five bonded molecules .",
    "results of this study suggest explicitly the existence of the structural transformations from low - density state to high density one at a `` stable liquid region '' of the water phase diagram .",
    "namely , we found for water system at the temperature @xmath15  k that the amoeba model reveals the transformation in the vicinity of the characteristic value of pressure @xmath73  atm .",
    "it is necessary to note the corresponding structural transformation from ldl to hdl water is not marked in the temperature - pressure phase diagrams of water given recently , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) and ref .  @xcite ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "strikingly , the transformation considered in this work has a lot of similar features with the _ polyamorphic _ phase transition from the low- to high - density amorphous forms of ice , which has been experimentally observed near 2000 atm and recognized as a first - order like transition ( see work of o. mishima et al .",
    "furthermore , the transition in amorphous phase has a peculiarity to involve the movement of one water molecule from the second coordination shell to an interstitial site in the first coordination shell @xcite , that is very similar to ldl / hdl structural transformation considered here .",
    "nevetheless , in the studied temperature - pressure range of stable liquid phase , there is no signatures of a phase transition in the thermodynamic sense between these two forms of water .",
    "the isothermal compressibility @xmath49 of the system decreases steadily with pressure , while the local extension of the isothermal compressibility @xmath11 as well as other local structural and vibrational characteristics manifests a step - like behavior at the characteristic value of pressure @xmath63  atm .",
    "it is found that the ldl / hdl structural transformation in the vicinity of the pressure @xmath63  atm has an influence on the low - frequency vibrational dynamics whereas the high - frequency molecular dynamics is independent on the pressure .",
