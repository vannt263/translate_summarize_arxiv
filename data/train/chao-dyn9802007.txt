    "a lattice of rssler systems coupled to their nearest neighbors by diffusion can be schematically written : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the three - component vector sitting at site @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the coupling strength , @xmath4 is the interval between coupling times , @xmath5 is the number of nearest - neighbors , @xmath6 is the neighborhood of site @xmath2 , and @xmath7 represents the state of @xmath8 after evolution under the rssler flow @xmath9 during a time @xmath4 . in other words , dropping the subscript @xmath2 : @xmath10    the rssler model possesses remarkable properties .",
    "it is usually written as a three - variable , first - order , ordinary differential system : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are real parameters .",
    "increasing @xmath14 while keeping @xmath12 and @xmath13 fixed ( for example @xmath15 as in @xcite ) , system ( [ rossler ] ) undergoes a hopf bifurcation followed by a cascade of subharmonic bifurcations eventually leading to chaos . for these parameter values ,",
    "the chaotic attractor is characterized by @xmath16 peaks of irregular amplitude but almost perfectly - defined frequency ( fig .  [ f1]a ) .",
    "similarly , trajectories in the @xmath17 plane are cycles of irregular amplitude but with a well - defined period ( fig .  [ f1]b ) .",
    "this allows the definition of `` phase '' and `` amplitude '' variables , either simply by using the @xmath17 plane with an origin set in the middle of the attractor ( fig .",
    "[ f1]b ) , or by more sophisticated methods .",
    "one can thus speak of a `` chaotic oscillator '' @xcite . picturing the rssler system as an oscillator translates the problem of the lrro observed in @xcite into a phase coherence , or synchronization , problem for a chaotic oscillatory medium .    in @xcite , the chaotic oscillatory behavior of lattices of rssler systems of the type ( [ lattice]-[rossler ] )",
    "was also used to draw an analogy with the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) , the generic nonlinear partial differential equation describing an oscillatory medium near a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the cgle reads : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a complex field , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real parameters .",
    "it was argued that the lrro observed can be well accounted for by a cgle with parameters corresponding to a regime where homogeneous oscillations are ( linearly ) stable , with some residual `` effective '' noise . in that analogy",
    ", the complex plane roughly corresponds to the @xmath17 plane of the rssler variables . on general grounds ,",
    "one expects the soft phase modes of the noisy stable cgle to be described at large scales by the kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( kpze ) are present and when the above - mentioned effective noise is delta - correlated . ] , a stochastic model for the kinetic roughening of fluctuating interfaces @xcite which reads : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a real field , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real parameters , and @xmath26 is an uncorrelated white noise with zero mean and correlators : @xmath27 in ( [ kpz ] ) , @xmath23 is the height of an interface and takes values on the entire real axis . in the present context , @xmath23 represents the angular ( or phase ) argument of the complex field @xmath19 ( or the phase @xmath28 of the rssler oscillators ) followed by continuity in space and time from some arbitrary initial value . in this representation ,",
    "the phase coherence problem described above can be restated in terms of the roughness of the phase interface : if the interface is rough ( its mean square width diverges in the infinite - size infinite - time limit ) , then no phase coherence exists .",
    "the kpze has gained considerable importance because many `` microscopic '' models share its non - trivial scaling properties , and also because some analytical results have been obtained @xcite . among those ,",
    "one is crucial here : interfaces governed by the kpze are always rough for space dimensions @xmath29 . assuming the validity of the kpze to describe the large - scale properties of lattices of coupled rssler oscillators",
    ", this result is at odds with the conclusion reached in @xcite .",
    "thus , either the numerical results of @xcite were too limited to reveal the loss of phase coherence in the infinite - size , infinite - time limit , or the kpze is not the correct stochastic equation . in the latter case ,",
    "the discrepancy probably lies in the properties of the `` effective noise '' ) , and that of the quadratic nonlinear term is insured by the relevance of the cgle demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the cgle , the @xmath30 term represents the quadratic dependence of frequency on wavenumber implied by the nonlinear term @xmath31 .",
    "] .    as a matter of fact",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason for the kpze to be the relevant large - scale description of the phase dynamics of coupled rssler oscillator lattices .",
    "but the `` universality class '' of the kpze has been shown to be remarkably large .",
    "in particular , recent findings show it to include the phase interface dynamics generated by the cgle in its so - called `` phase turbulence '' regime @xcite . in this spatiotemporally chaotic regime , there are no zeroes of the complex field @xmath19 , and a fluctuating continuous phase interface can always be defined .",
    "but there exist large portions of the parameter plane ( @xmath32 ) in which statistically - steady phase turbulence can be observed on very large scales , so that , in practice , breakdown is never observed . ] .",
    "to some extent , this case might appear very similar to the chaotic oscillatory media formed by lattices of rssler systems ; thus , one would expect the kpze to be relevant . on the other hand , as recalled above , chaos in the rssler system possesses some very specific features that might possibly produce an `` effective noise '' with peculiar properties .    given the space - time evolution of some interface , there exists a rather well - established procedure to determine whether the kpze is a relevant large - scale description @xcite . in the following",
    ", we briefly recall this procedure and follow it to investigate the coherent oscillations in lattices of coupled rssler systems from the angle of the phase interface dynamics they produce .",
    "we have performed numerical experiments of system ( [ lattice]-[rossler ] ) and studied the scale - invariance properties of the interface constructed from the `` phase '' of each of the rssler oscillators .",
    "the calculations were done in one space dimension , mostly for numerical convenience  if phase coherence is to be broken , it should be easier to observe for @xmath33  but also because many exact results are known in this case for the kpze .",
    "scale - invariance relies on the scaling assumption @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a similarity factor , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are ( respectively ) the roughness and dynamical exponents . for interfaces governed by the kpze",
    ", exponents are exactly known for @xmath33 : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "all scaling laws given in the following are for these values .    in practice , one usually considers global quantities such as the mean square width of the interface : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes space average . for a system of finite - size @xmath42 ,",
    "the width of an initially flat interface grows and saturates to a size - dependent mean value : @xmath43 for an infinitely large system , @xmath44 grows indefinitely : @xmath45 for the kpze , this growth phase actually takes place only beyond certain crossover scales @xcite : @xmath46 before which another scaling is observed , because the nonlinearities are not yet effective .",
    "the `` linear '' growth phase is characterized by a growth exponent @xmath47 for @xmath33 .",
    "one expects : @xmath48    relations ( [ saturated ] ) , ( [ nlgrowth ] ) , and ( [ lingrowth ] ) allow one to check dynamical scaling and to estimate whether the measured exponents are consistent with those of the kpze .",
    "in addition , the measure of the numerical prefactors of the scaling laws can lead to a determination of the effective parameters @xmath24 , @xmath49 , and @xmath25 of the corresponding kpze and of the crossover scales @xmath50 and @xmath51 , provided that @xmath25 is determined independently .",
    "this is usually achieved by measuring the changes in the velocity of the interface @xmath52 when it is submitted to a tilt @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is an integer `` winding number '' , using the relation @xcite : @xmath55",
    "we first consider a chain of rssler systems with periodic boundary conditions , as defined by ( [ lattice]-[rossler ] ) . the coupling strength and the coupling interval are set to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , values which insure the quasi - continuity of the medium and thus of the phase interface .",
    "the parameters of the rssler systems themselves have the same values as in @xcite : @xmath15 and @xmath58 . starting from random initial conditions far from the center of the rssler attractor , all",
    "oscillators quickly reach nearby values , yielding an initially quasi - flat interface .    for system sizes",
    "@xmath59 , saturation of the width of the interface could be observed , as well as the linear scaling with system size ( fig .",
    "regarding the growth of @xmath60 in a large system , even for the largest size ( @xmath61 ) and the longest times ( @xmath62 ) considered , only the linear regime ( @xmath63 ) seems to be observed ( fig .",
    "[ f2]b ) . from these results",
    ", we also estimate @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and thus @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "to estimate @xmath25 , we performed tilt experiments , preparing initial conditions with a prescribed winding number @xmath54 , and measuring the velocity of the phase interface .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ tilt ] ) , only the small @xmath68 behavior is of interest .",
    "however , for too small tilts , the variations of @xmath69 are not numerically measurable .",
    "consequently , a reliable measure of @xmath25 is very difficult .",
    "our results , obtained for moderate tilts , give @xmath70 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with @xcite , since , in the stable cgle context , @xmath71 with the parameters estimated at @xmath72 and @xmath73    gathering these results together , we obtain the following estimates : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . clearly , there is a contradiction between these estimates and the recorded behavior , which remained in the linear regime well beyond these scales .",
    "we will come back to this point in the discussion .",
    "there is one remarkable fact in the above results : the largest widths reached during our calculations are always very small ( at most of the order of @xmath77 ) .",
    "`` roughening '' is thus extremely weak in this system , even though the natural extrapolation of our numerical results is that , indeed , phase coherence should be lost in the infinite - size , infinite - time limit . in the next section",
    ", we consider the same system but with a modified coupling designed to increase the roughening of the phase interface .",
    "for the two - dimensional lattice of @xcite , the effective cgle was found to be in a regime where the spatially - homogeneous solution @xmath78 is linearly stable .",
    "one way of bringing the effective cgle into an intrinsically chaotic regime and thus , hopefully , to strengthen roughening is to increase @xmath20 , so as to be in a phase turbulence regime ( which is reached when @xmath79 ) . for the rssler lattice , this can be naively achieved by introducing a dispersive - like coupling between the @xmath80 and @xmath81 variables , replacing ( [ lattice ] ) by : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a new parameter controlling the dispersive part of the coupling .",
    "we studied the dynamic scaling of the phase interface with @xmath84 , and all other parameters as in the previous section .",
    "there is a clear increase in the phase fluctuations , though without the appearance of defects , as might be expected from a `` phase turbulence - like '' behavior .",
    "as before , the mean saturated square width scales with @xmath42 ( fig .  [ f3]a ) , yielding @xmath85 . the growth regime of the phase interface of a large system quickly reaches the scaling regime ( [ nlgrowth ] ) characteristic of the kpze ( fig .",
    "even though the roughening remains weak in absolute terms , the @xmath86 exponent indicates that the particular choice of coupling made here achieved its goal . the insert of fig .",
    "[ f3]b shows that the skewness of the interface , a universal ratio of amplitudes , takes the value expected for the one - dimensional kpze .    the scaling laws for @xmath60 shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] do not allow the independent determination of @xmath24 and @xmath49 . from fig .",
    "[ f3]b , using ( [ nlgrowth ] ) , one gets @xmath87 .",
    "this , together with the value @xmath88 measured from fig .",
    "[ f3]a , actually provides the following estimate : @xmath89 .",
    "there exist several ways of completing the estimation of the kpze parameters . here , as we merely wanted to check the consistency of the kpze picture , we limited ourselves to a rough fit of the early - time ( @xmath90 ) ) growth with the linear regime ( [ lingrowth ] ) ( not shown ) .",
    "this gives @xmath91 .",
    "finally , we find @xmath92 and @xmath93 , leading to @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . while the value of @xmath50 is reasonable in view of our numerical results , that of @xmath51 seems too large .",
    "one must keep in mind , of course , that these values are only rough estimates , especially for @xmath51 , given their large variation with parameters @xmath24 , @xmath49 , and @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "( [ crossover ] ) ) . an additional quantitative agreement with the kpze",
    "is provided by the value of the skewness of the interface in the growth regime , which is very close to the `` universal '' value for the kpze @xcite .",
    "extrapolating the results of the numerical experiments reported in this work to the infinite - size , infinite - time limit , one may first conclude that phase interfaces of chains of coupled rssler systems roughen , even if quantitative agreement with the kpze is debatable .",
    "this implies the loss of the phase coherence observed in finite systems .",
    "but this roughening is extremely weak , especially in the case of pure diffusive coupling . ] . using properties of the kpze",
    ", one can only expect an even weaker roughening in two space dimensions .",
    "in particular , a very slow logarithmic variation of the saturated width with @xmath42 during an extremely extended linear regime should be observed ( the crossover scales can easily be huge , given their variation with parameters for @xmath97 ) @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that no loss of coherence could be detected within the size / time range investigated in @xcite .    as mentioned , the validity of the kpze as the relevant large - scale stochastic description has not been firmly established .",
    "while the situation is satisfactory in the case of diffusive - dispersive coupling , there are discrepancies for the purely diffusive case : notably the estimates for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are inconsistent with the fact that the system was observed to remain in the linear growth regime for @xmath61 and @xmath98 .",
    "there are , in our view , two possible reasons for this .",
    "first , our estimates of the parameters of the effective kpze might be inaccurate , leading to estimates for the crossover scales that are orders of magnitude away from their actual values .",
    "indeed , given expressions ( [ crossover ] ) , the values of @xmath51 and @xmath50 can change dramatically even with moderate changes of @xmath25 , @xmath49 , and @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , @xmath25 is given by the variation of the interface velocity near zero tilt ( eq .  ( [ tilt ] ) , a region difficult to probe numerically .",
    "thus , the `` true '' value of @xmath25 could be extremely small , and consequently , @xmath50 and @xmath51 much larger than the estimates found here .",
    "second , and this is probably related to the first point , the `` effective noise '' could well be very different from ( [ noise ] ) @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the chaotic regime of the rssler system used here is characterized by strong amplitude fluctuations ( in the @xmath17 plane ) and quasi - nil phase fluctuations .",
    "thus , the very strong coherence of the phase interface in the case of diffusive coupling should not be surprising .",
    "on the other hand , the cross - coupling term added to introduce dispersion ( sec .",
    "[ s4 ] ) does provide a way of obtaining large phase fluctuations directly coupled to the local amplitude chaos of the rssler system .",
    "finally , we would like to come back to the status and role of the cgle in the problem studied here . even though lattices of coupled rssler systems do exhibit many of the qualitative features of the cgle",
    ", their equivalence with a cgle submitted to some noise can not be a strict one .",
    "specifically , there are no phase soft modes in the rssler case ( the `` gauge invariance '' of the cgle is broken ) .",
    "the approximate correspondence between the @xmath17 coordinates of the rssler system and the complex field @xmath19 of the cgle overlooks the role of the @xmath16 variable .",
    "a rough interface must , at every moment , include points where @xmath16 experiences a sharp peak ( fig.[f1]b ) .",
    "the effect of such localized structures might well be the cause of peculiar properties of the `` effective noise '' in a langevin - like description .",
    "since an initially flat interface probably resists the appearance of such structures , one can imagine a particularly strong rigidity of the interface yielding small widths , and , ultimately , very small values of @xmath99 .    for the diffusive - dispersive coupling case ,",
    "on the other hand , the equivalent cgle is expected to be in a phase turbulent regime . using @xmath100 and assuming , following the stable cgle , that @xmath71 which is roughly verified for the cgle even in phase turbulence regimes @xcite we have @xmath101 and effective cgle parameters in the phase turbulence region . ] ,",
    "which was shown in @xcite to be itself well described by the kpze at large scales .",
    "any additional perturbations , such as those introduced by the @xmath16 variable , are not expected to alter significantly this picture , in agreement with our findings .    even though finer numerical investigations are needed to resolve the difficulties encountered above , our work once more points at the subtleties involved when one tries to build a langevin description of chaotic extended systems .",
