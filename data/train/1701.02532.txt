    "topological insulators @xcite ( tis ) are materials with metallic surface states that are topologically protected by time - reversal symmetry and the insulating bulk . in the simplest case ,",
    "the topological surface state is given by a single dirac cone that is characterized by spin - momentum locking @xcite .",
    "the topological surface states have potential applications in spintronics and quantum computation , and it is therefore desirable to tune their properties to suit specific needs . tailoring the surface states can also lead to new physics .",
    "for example , by changing their dispersion relation @xcite they become more susceptible towards interactions which could lead to novel strongly correlated phases .",
    "one possibility consists of depositing a thin layer of a non - topological metal on the topological - insulator surface ( tis ) , effectively changing the boundary conditions at the surface @xcite .",
    "the topological surface state migrates to the new surface obtaining different properties depending on the type of deposited thin film .",
    "in particular , graphene , is a very interesting candidate , for a number of reasons .",
    "graphene has been studied extensively in the last decade and its properties are well known : it hosts four dirac cones in its bulk whose dirac structure act on the sublattice pseudospin of the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the dirac cones of graphene and the topological dirac cone can drastically change the properties of the resulting topological surface state @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lattice mismatch between graphene and the natural surface of several tis is very small , from a few percent to near perfect matching .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate transmission in heterostructures made from depositing graphene on top of the ( 111 ) surface of a bi@xmath0se@xmath1-like ti .",
    "this setup was recently experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "the archetypal strong topological insulator , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , has a layered crystal structure where each layer has trigonal symmetry and the layers are generally only weakly coupled by van der waals - like bonding .",
    "the ( 111 ) surface is parallel to these layers and hosts a single dirac cone at the center of the surface brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "if graphene is placed on top of this surface in the commensurate @xmath2 r30 stacking configuration , the graphene dirac cones are folded onto the topological dirac cone so that even weak coupling can strongly affect the low - energy physics if the chemical potential is tuned accordingly @xcite . in this configuration ,",
    "the trigonal lattice of graphene and the tis are rotated by @xmath3 with respect to each other and the surface unit cell contains six carbon atoms from graphene and one atom from the tis .",
    "the most promising currently known tis for realizing such a heterostructure are sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , which has recently been fabricated @xcite , and tlbise@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "both have only a lattice mismatch of the order of @xmath4% @xcite . while the interlayer coupling of sb@xmath0te@xmath1 is van der waals - like , that of tlbise@xmath0 is more covalent @xcite , allowing for stronger coupling between graphene and the tis in the latter case . in table",

    "the zero - temperature conductance through a barrier of width @xmath120 and length @xmath165 is given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the conductance quantum and where we have used dimensionful units .",

    "the plateaus in the conductance are caused by the antiresonances in the transmission probability discussed above .",
    "they are more pronounced for the zigzag barrier than the armchair barrier .",
    "with increasing @xmath155 , the number of plateaus increase and they move towards zero energy because of the reduced confinement . on the other hand , if we increase @xmath127 , more plateaus appear in the conductance and it is suppressed overall due to backscattering at oblique angles .",
    "in summary , we have considered the electronic transmission , using a continuum model , of the topological surface state of a three dimensional time - reversal invariant topological insulator through heterostructures made by depositing a monolayer graphene on the topological - insulator surface .",
    "we obtained the transmission of the topological surface state through a semi - infinite graphene step and a graphene nanoribbon for both zigzag and armchair boundaries .",
    "we found that the transmission depends strongly on the type of edge : in the case of a graphene step , we found that the transmission exhibits electron - hole asymmetry for the zz1 edge configuration while the transmission is perfect at all energies for armchair and zz2 junctions .",
    "moreover , our results show that the conductance through a graphene nanoribbon exhibits plateaus caused by antiresonances in the transmission probability at energies of the quasibound states of the deposited nanoribbon for both zigzag and armchair edges .",

    "hybrid graphene - ti devices could be fabricated using a mechanical transfer method where the chemical potential difference and electron density can be tuned by gate voltages .",
    "further studies are required to address the effect of an external magnetic field and the number of graphene layers on the transport properties .",

    "the new basis states are @xmath173 where @xmath174 corresponds to the even and odd valley subspace . under time reversal ,",
