    "more recent applications are in large - scale pdes through a reduced rank representation of operators with applications to quantum chemistry @xcite and aerospace engineering @xcite .",
    "beylkin and mohlenkamp @xcite used a technique called separated representation to obtain a low rank representation of multidimensional operators in quantum models ; see @xcite .",
    "hackbusch , khoromskij and tyrtyshnikov @xcite have solved multidimensional boundary and eigenvalue problems using a reduced low dimensional tensor - product space through separated representation and hierarchical kronecker tensor from the underlying high spatial dimensions .",
    "see the survey papers @xcite and the references therein for more applications and tensor based methods .",
    "extensive studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have exposed many aspects of the differences between tensors and matrices despite that tensors are multidimensional generalizations of matrices .    in this paper , we continue to investigate the relationship between matrices and tensors . here",
    "we address the questions : when is it possible to matricize ( _ tensorize _ ) and apply matrix ( tensor ) based methods to high dimensional problems and data with inherent tensor ( matrix ) structure .",
    "specifically , we address tensor inversion through group theoretic structures and by providing numerical methods for specific multilinear systems in quantum mechanical models and high - dimensional pdes .",
    "since the inversion of tensor impinges upon a tensor - tensor multiplication definition , the contracted product for tensor multiplication was chosen since it provides a natural setting for multilinear systems and high - dimensional eigenvalue problems considered here .",
    "it is also an intrinsic extension of the matrix product rule .",
    "still other choices of multiplication rules could be considered as well for particular application in hand .",
    "for example , in the matrix case , there are the alternative multiplication of strassen @xcite which improves the computational complexity by using block structure format and the optimized matrix multiplication based on _ blocking _ for improving cache performance by demmel @xcite . in a recent work of van loan @xcite , the idea of blocking",
    "are extended to tensors .",
    "our choice of the standard canonical tensor - tensor multiplication provides a useful setting for algorithms for decompositions , inversions and multilinear iterative solvers .    like tensors , multilinear systems are ubiquitous since they model many phenomena in engineering and sciences . in the field of continuum physics and engineering , isotropic and anisotropic elastic models @xcite",
    "are multilinear systems .",
    "multilinear systems are also prevalent in the numerical methods for solving partial differential equations ( pdes ) in high dimensions , although most tensor based methods for pdes require a reduction of the spatial dimensions and some applications of tensor decomposition techniques . here",
    "we focus on the iterative methods for solving the poisson problems in high dimension in a tensor format .",
    "tensor representations are also common in large discrete quantum models like the discrete schrdinger and anderson models .",
    "the study of spectral theory of the anderson model is a very active research topic .",
    "the anderson model @xcite , anderson s celebrated and ultimately nobel prize winning work is the archetype and most studied model for understanding the spectral and transport properties of an electron in a disordered medium .",
    "yet there are still many open problems and conjectures for high dimensional @xmath1 cases ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the hamiltonian of the discrete schrdinger and anderson models are tensors with an even number of modes ; they also satisfy the symmetries required in the tensor svd we described .",
    "moreover , computing the eigenvectors to check for localization properties not only demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms , but it actually gives some validation and provide some insights to some of the conjectures @xcite .",
    "recently , bai et al .",
    "@xcite have solved some key questions in quantum statistical mechanics numerically .",
    "for instance , they have developed numerical linear algebra methods for the many - electrons hubbard model and quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "numerical ( multi)linear algebra techniques are increasingly becoming useful tools in understanding very complicated models and very difficult problems in quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "the contribution of this paper is three - fold .",
    "first , we define the tensor group which provides the framework for formulating multilinear systems and tensor inversion .",
    "second , we discuss tensor decompositions derived from the isomorphic group structure and relate them to the standard tensor decompositions , namely , canonical polyadic ( cp ) @xcite and multilinear svd decompositions @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the tensor decompositions from the isomorphic properties are special cases of the well - known cp and multilinear svd with _",
    "symmetries _ while satisfying some conditions .",
    "stegeman @xcite extended kruskal s existence and uniqueness conditions for cp decomposition for cases with various forms of symmetries ( i.e. existence of identical factors ) .",
    "these decompositions appear in many signal processing applications ; e.g. see @xcite and the references therein . when the tensor has the same dimension in all modes , the tensor eigenvalue decomposition in section 3 is the tensor eigendecomposition described by de lathauwer et al . in @xcite which is prevalent in signal processing applications , namely in , the blind identification of underdetermined mixtures problems .",
    "last , we describe multilinear systems in pdes and quantum models .",
    "we provide numerical methods for solving multilinear systems of pdes and tensor eigenvalue decompositions for high dimensional eigenvalue problems .",
    "multilinear systems which do not fit in the framework are addressed by providing pseudo - inversion methods .",
