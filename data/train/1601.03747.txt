    "[ fig : zeeman ] ) .",
    "indeed the magnetic field dependence of the two higher energy modes follows @xmath115 behaviour .",
    "this is due to the fact that the triplon modes do not possess well - defined spin quantum number ( @xmath116 , spin component along the field direction ) as a result of magnetic anisotropies .",
    "instead the usual spin quantum numbers ( @xmath117 ) in the spin isotropic case are mixed in the triplon modes .",
    "the non - linear magnetic field dependence can also be found in other field directions .",
