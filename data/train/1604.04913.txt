    "targeted therapy using imatinib , nilotinib or dasatinib has become standard treatment for chronicle myeloid leukemia .",
    "a minority of patients , however , fail to respond to treatment or relapse due to drug resistance",
    ". one primary driving factor of drug resistance are point mutations within the driving oncogene .",
    "laboratory studies have shown that different leukemic mutants respond differently to different drugs , so a promising way to improve treatment efficacy is to combine multiple targeted therapies .",
    "we build a mathematical model to predict the dynamics of different leukemic mutants with imatinib , nilotinib and dasatinib , and employ optimization techniques to find the best treatment schedule of combining the three drugs sequentially .",
    "our study shows that the optimally designed combination therapy is more effective at controlling the leukemic cell burden than any monotherapy under a wide range of scenarios .",
    "the structure of the optimal schedule depends heavily on the mutant types present , growth kinetics of leukemic cells and drug toxicity parameters .",
    "our methodology is an important step towards the design of personalized optimal therapeutic schedules for chronicle myeloid leukemia .",
    "chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder leading to the over - proliferation of myeloid cells and an increase in cellular output from the bone marrow that is often associated with splenomegaly .",
    "the most common driving mutation in cml is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that produces a fusion gene known as bcr - abl .",
    "the bcr - abl protein promotes proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis of myeloid progenitor cells and thereby drives expansion of this cell population . by targeting the bcr - abl oncoprotein , imatinib ( brand name gleevec )",
    "is able to induce a complete cytogenetic remission in the majority of chronic phase cml patients .",
    "a minority of patients , however , either fail to respond or eventually develop resistance to treatment with imatinib @xcite . it is thought that a primary driver of this resistance to imatinib is point mutations within the bcr - abl gene . a recent study utilizing sensitive detection methods demonstrated that a small subset of these mutations may exist before the initiation of therapy in a significant fraction of patients , and that this status is correlated with eventual treatment failure  @xcite .",
    "second generation agents such as dasatinib and nilotinib have been developed and each has shown efficacy against various common mutant forms of bcr - abl .",
    "this leads to the observation that the various mutant forms of bcr - abl result in cml that have unique dynamics under therapy , and that combinations of these inhibitors may be necessary to effectively control a rapidly evolving cml population .",
    "patients with cml often die due to transformation of the disease into an acute form of leukemia known as blast crisis .",
    "it has been shown that blast crisis is due to the accumulation of additional mutations in cml progenitor cells  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to leverage the differential responses of cml mutant strains to design novel sequential combination treatment schedules using dasatinib , imatinib and nilotinib that optimally control leukemic burden and delay treatment failure due to pre - existing resistance .",
    "we develop and parametrize a mathematical model for the evolution of both wild - type ( wt ) cml and mutated ( resistant ) cml cells in the presence of each therapy .",
    "then we formulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem in which a sequence of monthly treatment decisions is optimized to identify the temporal sequence of imatinib , dasatinib , and nilotinib administration that minimizes the total cml cell population over a long time horizon .",
    "there has been a significant amount of work done in the past to mathematically model cml .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors developed a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that model both the normal progression from stem cell to mature blood cells and abnormal progression of cml .",
    "a hierarchical system of differential equations was used to model the response of cml cells to imatinib therapy in @xcite ; this model fit the biphasic nature of decline in bcr - abl positive cells during imatinib treatment . in @xcite",
    "the authors investigated the number of different resistant strains present in a newly diagnosed chronic phase cml patient .",
    "an optimal control approach was utilized to optimize imatinib scheduling in @xcite . particularly relevant to our work",
    "is @xcite where the authors investigated simultaneous continuous administration of dasatinib , nilotinib and imatinib ; in particular , they explored the minimal number of drugs necessary to prevent drug resistance .",
    "in the current work , we focus on understanding the optimal administration schedule of multiple therapies to prevent resistance , and studying the impact of toxicity constraints on optimal scheduling .",
    "since several of the available tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tki ) share similar toxicities ( in particular neutropenia , see e.g. , @xcite ) combining them together can lead to elevated risk of adverse events .",
    "thus we consider sequential combination therapies in which only one tki may be administered at a time .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the risk of treatment failure and blast crisis are highest within the first 2 years from diagnosis  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is possible that optimized , sequential single agent therapy may be sufficient to minimize the risk of treatment failure . allowing only one treatment at a time leads to a complex , time - dependent discrete optimization problem .",
    "another line of research closely related to the current work is the use of optimal control techniques in the design of optimal temporally continuous drug concentration profiles ( see , e.g. , review articles @xcite and the textbook @xcite ) . in this field",
    "the tools of optimal control such as the pontryagin principle and the euler - lagrange equations are used to find drug concentration profiles that result in minimal tumor cell populations under toxicity constraints .",
    "particularly relevant to the current work is @xcite where the authors searched for optimal anti - hiv treatment strategies .",
    "they dealt with the similar problem of treating heterogeneous populations with multiple drugs .",
    "one major drawback of these works is the fact that it is nearly impossible to to achieve a specific optimal continuous drug - concentration profile in patients , since drug concentration over time is a combined result of a treatment schedule ( e.g. sequence of discrete oral administrations ) and pharmacokinetic processes in the body including metabolism , elimination , etc .",
    "thus the clinical utility of an optimal continuous drug concentration profile is limited .",
    "in contrast to these previous works , here we model the optimization problem as a more clinically realistic sequence of monthly treatment decisions .",
    "imposition of this fixed discrete set of decision times leads to a challenging optimization problem .",
    "such dynamical systems are referred to as ` switched nonlinear systems ' in the control community  @xcite , and our problem additionally imposes fixed switching times . in this work",
    "we will leverage the system structure and tools from mixed - integer linear optimization  @xcite to solve this problem numerically , resulting in optimal therapy schedules that are easy to implement in practice .",
    "we consider an ode model of the differentiation hierarchy of hematopoietic cells , adapted from  @xcite .",
    "stem cells ( sc ) on top of the hierarchy give rise to progenitor cells ( pc ) , which produce differentiated cells ( dc ) , which in turn produce terminally differentiated cells ( tc ) .",
    "this differentiation hierarchy applies to both normal and leukemic cells  @xcite .",
    "we consider in our model leukemic wt cells as well as pre - existing bcr - abl mutant cell types .",
    "we use type 1 , type 2 , and type @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) cells to denote normal , leukemic wt , and @xmath2 leukemic mutant cells ; layer 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 cells to denote sc , pc , dc , and tc ; and drug 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 to denote a drug holiday , nilotinib , dasatinib , and imatinib , respectively .",

    "one of the most common side effects of tkis in cml is neutropenia , or the condition of abnormally low neutrophils in the blood .",
    "neutropenia is defined in terms of the absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) . to incorporate toxicity constraints we develop a model of the dynamics of the patient s anc in response to each therapy schedule .",
    "we then constrain our optimization problem by considering only schedules during which the patient s anc stays above an acceptable threshold level @xmath30 .",

    "if a patient s anc falls below the threshold , a drug holiday is required at the next monthly treatment decision stage . during a drug holiday",

    "<S> over the past decade , several targeted therapies ( e.g. imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib ) have been developed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) . despite an initial response to therapy , </S>",
    "<S> drug resistance remains a problem for some cml patients . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have shown that resistance mutations that preexist treatment can be detected in a substantial number of patients , and that this may be associated with eventual treatment failure . </S>",
    "<S> one proposed method to extend treatment efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted therapies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the design of such combination therapies ( timing , sequence , etc . ) remains an open challenge . in this work we mathematically model the dynamics of cml response to combination therapy and </S>",
    "<S> analyze the impact of combination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in patients with preexisting resistance . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose an optimization problem to find the best schedule of multiple therapies based on the evolution of cml according to our ordinary differential equation model . </S>",
    "<S> this resulting optimization problem is nontrivial due to the presence of ordinary different equation constraints and integer variables . </S>",
    "<S> our model also incorporates realistic drug toxicity constraints by tracking the dynamics of patient neutrophil counts in response to therapy . using realistic parameter estimates </S>",
    "<S> , we determine optimal combination strategies that maximize time until treatment failure . </S>"
