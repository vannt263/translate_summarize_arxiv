    "the web has become pervasive and digital technology permeates every aspect of daily life . social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement , and economic decision - making",
    "are influenced by the digital hyperconnectivity @xcite .",
    "nowadays , everyone can produce and access a variety of information actively participating in the diffusion and reinforcement of narratives , by which we mean information coherent with a given worldview .",
    "such a shift of paradigm in the consumption of information has profoundly affected the way people get informed@xcite .",
    "however , the role of the socio - technical systems in shaping the public opinion still remains unclear .",
    "indeed , the spreading of unsubstantiated rumors , whether it is unintentional or intentional ( e.g. , for political reasons or even trolling ) , could have serious consequences ; the world economic forum has listed _ massive digital misinformation _ as one of the main risks for the modern society @xcite .    on online social networks , users discover and share information with their friends and through _ cascades _ of reshares information",
    "might reach a large number of individuals .",
    "cascades are rare @xcite , but are common on online social media such as facebook or twitter @xcite .",
    "interesting is the popular case of senator cirenga s @xcite law proposing to fund policy makers with 134 million of euros ( 10% of the italian gdp ) in case of defeat in the political competition .",
    "this was an intentional joke  the text of the post was explicitly mentioning its provocative nature  that became popular within online political activists to an extent that it has been used as an argumentation in political debates @xcite .",
    "the information overload mixed with users limited attention may facilitate the creation of urban legends .    predicting the evolution of cascades is far from trivial @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we want to understand the driving forces behind the popularity of contents accounting for the users information consumption patterns . to this end , we focus on two very distinct types of information : scientific and conspiracy news .",
    "the former are aiming at diffusing scientific knowledge as well as scientific thinking , while the latter provide alternative arguments that are difficult to substantiate .",
    "conspiracists tend to reduce the complexity of reality by explaining significant social or political occurrences as plots conceived by powerful individuals or organizations .",
    "since these kinds of arguments can sometimes involve the rejection of science , alternative explanations are invoked to replace the scientific evidence @xcite .",
    "for instance , people who reject the link between hiv and aids generally believe that aids was created by the u.s .",
    "government to control the african american population @xcite .",
    "just recently , the fear of an ebola outbreak in the united states rippled through social media networks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spread of misinformation can be particularly difficult to correct @xcite .",
    "in fact , recently , in @xcite it has been shown that conspiracist and mainstream information reverberate in a similar way on social media and that users generally exposed to conspiracy stories are the more prone to like and share satirical information @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , scientific debunking on conspiracy rumors creates a reinforcement effect in consuming conspiracist information on polarized users @xcite .",
    "* virality of unsubstantiated rumors . * in this work , we analyze a sample of @xmath0 facebook italian users consuming different ( and opposite ) kind of information : scientific and conspiracy news .",
    "we observe that users engagement across different contents correlates with the number of friends having similar consumption patterns ( _ homophily _ ) .",
    "then , we focus on the popularity of posts of the two categories , finding that both present similar statistical signatures . finally , we test this diffusion patterns on an external sample of @xmath1 intentional false information  satirical version and paradoxical claims  confirming that neither hubs ( structural properties ) nor the most active users ( influencers ) are relevant to characterize viral phenomena .",
    "our analysis shows that where misinformation is pervasive , users aggregation around shared beliefs makes the frequent exposure to conspiracy stories ( _ polarization _ ) a determinant for the virality of false information .",
    "furthermore , we provide important insights toward the understanding of viral processes around false information on online social media . in particular , through the relation between the users engagement and the number of friends , we provide new metrics ",
    "i.e. , users polarization defined on the information consumption patterns  to detect areas in the social network where false claims are more likely to spread .",
    "we conclude the paper showing a nice case study about the role of the frequent exposure to conspiracy stories ( _ polarization _ ) on the virality of false information .",
    "recent studies explored the evolution of social phenomena on online social networks from observable data ; one of the most investigated aspects are the structural properties and their effect on social dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the strength of weak ties is currently matter of debate .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is shown that while long ties are relevant in the spreading of innovation and social movements , they are not enough to spread social reinforcement . in  @xcite the author found evidence of an effect of reinforcement in the adoption for clustered networks , where many redundant ties are present . in a more recent work  @xcite ,",
    "the number of different connected components , representing separate social contexts for the user , proved to be more influential than the number of friends itself and other properties of potential influencers have been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "another interesting challenge is the one studying the possibility to distinguish influence from homophily @xcite . in  @xcite it",
    "is performed over the global network of instant messaging traffic among about 30 millions users on yahoo.com , with complete data on the adoption of a mobile service application and precise dynamic behavioral data on users .",
    "the effect of homophily proves to explain more than @xmath2 of the phenomena perceived as contagion . in",
    "@xcite the role of social network and exposure to friends activities in information re - sharing on facebook is analyzed . through",
    "controlled experiments in which user were divided in exposed and not exposed to friends re - sharing , authors were able to isolate contagion from other confounding effects like homophily .",
    "they claimed that in the exposed case there is a considerably higher chance to share contents .",
    "recent studies settled on facebook aimed at unfolding cascades characteristics  @xcite and predicting their trajectories and shapes  @xcite .",
    "as for the characteristics , it is found that a small but significant fraction of posts forms wide and deep cascades and that different cascades may evolve in different ways .",
    "many aspects of cascades behavior  e.g. , under which structural and user - constrained properties is possible to predict them  are hard tasks that have not been completely exploited . in the last years",
    ", a new online phenomenon is attracting the interest of the researchers community , the spreading of unsubstantiated and false claims through osn ( as facebook ) , that often reverberate leading to mass misinformation .",
    "the study in  @xcite is a detailed analysis of the information consumption by facebook users on different categories of pages : alternative information sources , political activism and mainstream media .",
    "authors pointed out evidences that mainstream media information reverberate as long as unsubstantiated one , and that the exposition to the latter makes users more likely to interact with intentionally injected false information .",
    "more recently , in @xcite it has been shown that the exposure to debunking posts might increase the engagement of users in consuming conspiracy information .",
    "in this work , we aim at testing the relationship of content consumption with respect to social networks structure and viral phenomena . to do this , we need to clearly identify sources that are promoting different contents referring to opposite worldviews .",
    "we define the space of our investigation with the help of facebookgroups very active in the debunking of conspiracy theses ( see the acknowledgements section for further details ) .",
    "we started from 73 public facebookpages , from which 34 are about scientific news and 39 about news that can be considered conspiratorial ; we refer to the former as _ science pages _ and to the latter as _ conspiracy pages_. in table  [ tab : data_dim ] we summarize the details of our data collection .",
    "we downloaded all posts from these pages in a timespan of 4 years ( 2010 to 2014 ) .",
    "in addition , we collected all the _ likes _ and _ comments _ from the posts , and we counted the number of _ _ shares__. in total , we collected around @xmath3 likes and @xmath4 comments , performed by about @xmath0 and @xmath5 facebookusers , respectively ( see table  [ tab : data_dim ] )",
    ". likes , shares , and comments have a different meaning from the user viewpoint .",
    "most of the times , a like stands for a positive feedback to the post ; a share expresses the will to increase the visibility of a given information ; and a comment is the way in which online collective debates take form .",
    "comments may contain negative or positive feedbacks with respect to the post .",
    "in addition , we collected the ego networks of users who liked at least one post on science or conspiracy pages of the total connections , allowing us to perform a meaningful analysis regarding the connections between users .",
    "] , that is , for each of these users we collected the list of friends and the links between them . this allowed us to create a social network of users and the ( publicly declared ) connections between them for a total of about @xmath0 nodes and @xmath6 edges .    .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we obtained access to @xmath1 posts from two satirical facebookpages ( to which we will refer to as _ troll posts _ and _ troll pages _ ) promoting intentionally false and caricatural version of the most debated issues .",
    "the more popular of the two is called called `` semplicemente me '' , it is followed by about @xmath7 users and it is focused on general online rumors .",
    "the second one is called `` simply humans '' , it is followed by about @xmath8 users , and it hosts mostly posts of conspiratorial nature .",
    "we collected about @xmath9 likes and @xmath10 comments on these posts , performed by about @xmath11 and @xmath12 facebookusers , respectively .",
    "these pages were able to trigger several viral phenomena , with one of them reaching more than @xmath13 shares . in section  [ sec : virality ] , we use troll memes to measure how the social ecosystem under investigation is responding to the injection of false information .",

    "we define @xmath26 and call it the _ engagement _ of user @xmath24 as the normalized liking activity with respect to of all the users in our dataset , namely @xmath27 .",
    "we are interested in learning the extent to which users are polarized in a given content . following previous works  @xcite , we are interested in studying the polarization of users , which we informally define as the tendency of users to interact about only with a single type of information . here",
    "we study the polarization towards science and conspiracy . to quantify it",

    "they show that in viral posts ( i.e. , posts with high values of shares ) , very active users ( in terms either of number of friends or liking activity ) form a tiny fraction of the overall users .",
    "we have checked that similar results hold when accounting for commenting activity .",
    "since the distributions of both degree and liking activity are heavy tailed , large volumes of users that make a post viral are mainly composed of users with low degree and liking activity .",
    "users preference towards information belonging to a particular kind of narrative might provide interesting insights with respect to the determinants of viral phenomena . under the light of the findings in the previous section , we now focus on how _ false information _ can spread in facebook .",
    "we use the set of @xmath1 _ troll _ posts described in section  [ sec : data ] and we study the virality of each post with respect to the network structure and users liking activity .",
    "notice that such a set of posts is disjoint from the one used to classify users as polarized towards science or conspiracy , thus we can obtain unbiased results regarding the effect of users polarization in the diffusion of false information .",
    "figure  [ fig : troll_virality ] shows the same information of figures  [ fig : likers_shares_deg ] and  [ fig : likers_shares_act ] but for troll posts .",
    "again , in viral posts , very active users ( in terms either of number of friends or liking activity ) form a tiny fraction of the overall users .",
    "however , we found an interesting fact : in most of the viral posts users are highly polarized . in figure",
    "[ fig : troll_polarization ] , for each troll post , we show polarization @xmath91 of users who liked it against its number of shares . whereas users both degree and liking activity become low as the number of shares increases , polarization @xmath71 is relevant for all levels of shares .        in figure",
    "[ fig : troll_polarization2 ] we show the average value of the polarization for increasing levels of the number of shares .",

    "the plot indicates that for posts containing false claims with more than 100 shares , the average polarization of the users who liked it is high and remains constant with the increase ( at different orders of magnitude ) of the virality .        to better shape the role the polarization @xmath91 in viral phenomena around false information",
    ", we study how it changes by considering posts with increasing levels of virality . in figure",
    "[ fig : troll_polarization3 ] we show the pdf of users average polarization for different levels of virality .",
    "we observe that for highly viral posts ( with false information ) the average polarization value of the users who like them peaks around  @xmath93 .",
    "observe that the pick increases with virality of posts .",
    "indication that high polarization is most of the times essential for a post becoming viral .",
    "the results indicate that a good indicator to detect viral phenomena around false information is the users polarization .",
    "the diffusion of false claims proliferates within ( tightly clustered ) users that are usually exposed to unsubstantiated rumors .",
    "let us now obtain some more intuition by studying in more detail the most viral troll posts  @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ fig:3_most_viral ] we show the probability density function of the polarization of the users that liked each of the three troll posts .",
    "the most viral post with @xmath94 shares says that in the year of the post ( 2013 ) , after @xmath95 years , the month of october has 5 tuesdays , wednesdays , and thursdays , and that this is a very rare event so that chinese people call it year of the glory _",
    "shu tan tzu_. the fact that october 2013 has 5 tuesdays , wednesdays , and thursdays is true , however the rest is false : this happens around once every seven years and the phrase has no sense in chinese .",
    "the second one is the popular case of senator cirenga mentioned in the introduction , which received more than @xmath96 shares .",
    "the third one has a more political taste by stating that the former italian speaker of the house received a large sum of money after his resignation .",
    "this post was shared @xmath97 times . in figure  [ fig:3_most_viral ]",
    "we show the pdf of users polarization liking these three posts .",
    "we can see that in all three posts there is a significant proportion of conspiracy users , who have seen the post through a viral process ( note that the total subscribers to the facebookgroup pages are upper bounded by about only @xmath98 , and we expect a much smaller proportion to have seen the posts in their facebookfeeds ) .",
    "interestingly , there is always a no - negligible number of science users who have also liked the posts , even though they are from four to ten times less .",
    "actually , we can observe that the percentage of science users depends directly on the content of the post : the more towards conspiracy a post is , the less the ratio of science users . to provide a better outline of this phenomenon we also plot in figure  [ fig : most_viral_sh ] the two most viral posts @xcite from the troll page that is more specific in teasing conspiracy stories ( see section  [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "the first post mentions that a chinese engineer discovered an eco - friendly ( uranium - based ) lamp that produces extremely bright light at an extremely low cost ( order of pennies ) while being able to several hundred years .",

    "note that in those ones the liking activity of science users is very close to zero .",
    "nowadays , understanding the determinants of viral phenomena occurring on socio - technical systems is a very interesting challenge .",
    "the free circulation of contents has changed the way people get informed , and the quality of information plays a fundamental role in collective debates . in this work , we addressed the relationships between the virality of false claims and the users information consumption patterns . to do this ,",
    "we analyze a sample of @xmath0 facebook italian users consuming different ( and opposite ) types of information  science and conspiracy news .",
    "we found out that users engagement across different contents correlates with the number of friends having similar consumption patterns ( _ homophily _ ) .",
    "next , we studied the virality of posts of the two categories , finding that both present similar statistical signatures . finally , we tested diffusion patterns on an external set of @xmath1 intentionally satirical false posts ( troll posts ) and we discovered that neither the presence of hubs ( structural properties ) nor the most active users ( influencers ) are prevalent in viral phenomena .",
    "the results of this work provide important insights towards the understanding of viral processes around false information on online social media .",
    "in particular , we provide a new metric  user polarization defined on the information consumption patterns  which along with users engagement and the number of friends helps in the discovery of where in the social network false claims are more likely to spread .",
    "in addition , we show that users aggregation around shared beliefs makes the frequent exposure to conspiracy stories ( _ polarization _ ) a determinant for the virality of false information .",
