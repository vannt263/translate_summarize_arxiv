    "symmetry is an essential ingredient of almost all physical theories .",
    "in particular , invariance under certain lie groups characterizes e.g. minkowski space and most of interactions are regulated also by certain gauge groups , like @xmath1(color ) , @xmath0 and @xmath7 for the three forces of particle physics .",
    "in this paper we remark the important rle placed by hexagonal root structures in higher dimensional theories , all related to superstrings .",
    "this comes about because several compactification groups show in their root systems a hexagonal pattern .",
    "for such a group @xmath8 , we have a relation between the dimension and the rank which reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an integer specified later on .",
    "the symmetry group is already the lie group itself @xmath8 , but besides the weyl discrete symmetry group of the dynkin diagram stresses , in our case , the hexagonal symmetry . at the moment , we just want to state these peculiarities and symmetries , leaving for further work to grasp the true meaning of that coincidences in string theory and related models .    to motivate the study , we first consider the traditional superstring theory , living in @xmath11 dimensions @xcite .",
    "if we impose @xmath12 supersymmetry in our realizable 4-dimensional world , we are forced to compactify the remaining @xmath13 dimensions in a calabi - yau threefold ( @xmath14 .",
    "the holonomy group @xcite of a general @xmath15 manifold is @xmath16 , and in our @xmath17 case it is reduced to @xmath1 .",
    "its dimension is @xmath18 . in the corresponding lie algebra",
    "noted @xmath19 , there are the two simple roots @xmath20 and @xmath21 of equal length , and at @xmath22 angle .",
    "its dynkin diagram is as follows @xmath23 the total six nonzero roots come from these simple ones , with the sum and the opposed , to form the well known ( single ) hexagon .",
    "see fig.-1-    .",
    ", width=302 ]    the weyl group of the @xmath24 lie algebra is the symmetric group @xmath25 of order @xmath26 .",
    "it acts transitive and freely (= trivial stabilizer ) on the hexagon .",
    "this appearance of @xmath1 in string theory is the more remarkable , as it is the third time this group appears in fundamental physics .",
    "we remember the original group @xmath1 flavour of gell - mann ( 1962 ) @xcite , mixing the first three quarks flavors ( up @xmath27 , down @xmath28 and strange @xmath29 ) . later ( 1972 ) , gell - mann and fritzsch introduced also @xmath1 as the gauge ( color ) group of the strong interactions@xcite , giving rise to qcd .",
    "at this point we only remark that the presence of the three @xmath1 groups in microphysics seem to be completely unrelated with each other .",
    "as we are to consider other holonomy groups , it is good to recall here briefly berger classification of them , in this particular form , depending on the field of numbers and on some restrictions on the manifolds @xcite .",
    "we shall follow the approach in @xcite .",
    "a general ( paracompact ) @xmath30-dimensional manifold @xmath31 admits always a riemannian structure , whose generic holonomy group is the full orthogonal group @xmath32 . if @xmath31 is just orientable , the group becomes the connected rotation ( sub)group @xmath33 ; the condition for this is that the first stiefel - whitney class vanishes , @xmath34 . for complex khler manifolds of complex dimension @xmath30 , the game",
    "is played by the unitary @xmath35 and the unitary unimodular ( sub)group @xmath16 , and again the obstruction is measured by the first chern class @xmath36 of the ( complex ) tangent bundle .",
    "one completes the table with some quaternionic and octonionic groups .",
    "here is the full classification of special holonomy groups @xcite , as related to the four division number algebras @xmath37 and @xmath38 :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that all include hexagons .",
    "it seems remarkable to us that even the large groups used as gauge groups in string theory , and related models , can group the nonzero roots in some hexagons .",
    "@xmath5 appears as itself in m - theory @xcite , and as squared @xmath39 in one of the heterotic strings .",
    "but , in dimensions @xmath40 and @xmath41 we have again nonzero roots grouped in hexagons : in dealing with simply laced groups , there is an hexagon for each @xmath19 bond for example , in @xmath5 @xmath42 as for the other heterotic string group , @xmath43 , it is also a @xmath44 series groups , which is simply laced one , and it should include hexagons .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath45 we realize it is hard to imagine any role for these numerous hexagons , but the numbers are there .",
    "also , at face value we do not see any rle for the octonions .",
    "we can not skip the appearance of hexagonal structures in other domains of physics .",
    "we add this just to reinforce our point of view ; in particular hexagons , dual triangles and squares tessellate the plane @xmath46 . for another example , in solid state physics , the structure of graphene @xcite ( or laminar graphite ) has been shown a hexagonal structure , linked to the benzene hexagon .",
    "one also expects some hexagonal structures to arise also in valence - four elements , as carbon ; in particular , silicium(si ) and germanium(ge ) are expected to have hexagonal structures also .    _",
