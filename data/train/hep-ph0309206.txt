    "strong interactions are hard to tackle and different tools or limits in the parameter space of a given asymptotically free theory have been proposed .",
    "the large number of colors ( @xmath3 ) limit is a relevant example @xcite . but",
    "how large should @xmath3 be for the counting scheme to be not only qualitatively but also quantitatively interesting for qcd ?",
    "in this note we try to answer this question in terms of the nature of the low energy hadronic spectrum .",
    "the physical situation where the large @xmath3 approximation seems closest to direct experimental check is perhaps low energy @xmath0 ( or meson meson ) scattering .",
    "large @xmath3 predicts the low energy amplitude to be a sum of tree diagrams  contact terms and resonance pole diagrams . with the two reasonable additions : truncation of number of resonances and some kind of regularization to give the resonances finite widths",
    ", this corresponds to the way in which the analyses of experimentally derived partial wave amplitudes are usually performed .",
    "we shall proceed in this manner with the additional requirement that all pre - regularized tree amplitudes be obtained from a chiral invariant ( modulo usual symmetry breaking terms ) lagrangian .",
    "the most crucial partial wave for our considerations turns out to be the scalar , isotopic spin zero channel .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest @xcite- @xcite in the low energy behavior of this channel .",
    "especially , many physicists now believe in the existence of the light , broad @xmath4 resonance , sigma in the 500 - 600 mev region .",
    "the sigma is also very likely the  tip of an iceberg \" which may consist of a nonet of light four quark - type scalars @xcite mixing @xcite with another heavier @xmath5 - type scalar nonet as well as a glueball .",
    "however there has been some controversy as to the underlying nature of these low lying scalar objects . in the present context , it was argued @xcite that a four quark state in the leading large @xmath3 limit would choose to appear as two non - interacting @xmath6 states .",
    "the necessity of such a state to explain the scattering then suggests a critical value of @xmath3 , below which a simple analysis of @xmath7 scattering up to a given energy ( taken as 1 gev for definiteness ) and based on the large @xmath3 approximation is not accurate .    to obtain this critical value",
    ", we make a reanalysis of meson - meson scattering as a function of the number of colors .",
    "the @xmath3 dependences can be easily incorporated in the parameters ( such as the pion decay constant or the vector meson @xmath8 coupling to two pions ) of the theory and of the states whose large @xmath3 counting is known . the criterion for",
    "an accurate description will be whether the unitarity bounds are satisfied up to the energy of at least 1 gev .",
    "a variety of different approaches to meson - meson scattering have been developed in the literature and all are able to provide a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "an approach to describing @xmath0 , @xmath4 scattering based on a conventional non - linear chiral lagrangian of pseudoscalar and vector fields augmented by scalar fields introduced in a chiral invariant manner was discussed in and will be adoped here .",
    "this will have an advantage , for our present purpose , of not forcing the amplitudes to be unitary .",
    "thus unitarity can be considered as a criterion for an accurate theory . in the physical @xmath9 case",
    ", the experimental data from threshold to a bit beyond 1 gev can be fit by computing the tree amplitude from this lagrangian and choosing parameters to yield an approximate unitarization .",
    "the following ingredients are present : i ) the  current algebra \" contact term , ii ) the vector meson exchange terms , iii ) the unitarized @xmath10(560 ) exchange terms and iv ) the unitarized @xmath11(980 ) exchange terms .",
    "although the @xmath8(770 ) vector meson certainly is a crucial feature of low energy physics , a fit can be made @xcite in which the contribution ii ) is absent .",
    "this results in a somewhat lighter and broader sigma meson , in agreement with other approaches which neglect the effect of the @xmath8 meson .",
    "we note that the @xmath12 contribution is needed to keep the @xmath4 scattering amplitude within the unitarity bounds @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that the @xmath12 contribution is also needed to provide the correct background which flips the sign of the @xmath13 resonance ( the ramsauer - townsend effect ) .    for the purpose of checking the above strong interaction calculation",
    ", the meson - meson scattering was also calculated in a general version of the _ linear _",
    "su(3 ) sigma model , which contains both @xmath10(560 ) and @xmath13 candidates @xcite .",
    "the procedure adopted was to calculate the tree amplitude and then to unitarize , without introducing any new parameters , by identifying the tree amplitude as the k - matrix amplitude .",
    "this also gave a reasonable fit to the data , including the characteristic ramsauer - townsend effect of the @xmath13 resonance contribution . at a deeper and more realistic level of description in the linear sigma model framework ,",
    "one expects two different chiral multiplets - @xmath6 as well as @xmath14 - to mix with each other .",
    "a start on this model seems encouraging @xcite .",
    "although we shall adopt the non - linear realization approach , our results are expected to be robust .",
    "we will also focus , for simplicity , on the su(2 ) flavor limit of qcd . in section ii we study the real parts of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes for the @xmath4 and @xmath15 channels as functions of the number of colors .",
    "the contributions of the current algebra and the vector meson @xmath8 exchange pieces are both taken into account .",
    "we show that chiral symmetry , crossing symmetry and the unitarity bounds are all satisfied in the leading order in @xmath3 for @xmath16 .",
    "however the unitarity bound will not hold for lower values of @xmath3 .",
    "section iii is dedicated to the low energy scalar ( the @xmath10 ) which is needed to unitarize the @xmath17 amplitude for @xmath18 .",
    "we first analyze the @xmath4 pion - pion scattering amplitude as a function of the number of colors . in terms of the conventional amplitude , @xmath19 the @xmath20 amplitude is @xmath21 .",
    "one gets the @xmath22 state by projecting out the correct partial wave .",
    "we focus , following , on the real part of the scattering amplitude since the imaginary part can be determined , using the unitarity relation , from the real part .",
    "of course , unitarity requires that the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude itself must satisfy the constraint @xmath23 .",
    "this condition is crucial to obtain the critical number of colors in the following analysis .",
    "the current algebra contribution to the conventional amplitude is @xmath24 where the pion decay constant , @xmath25 depends on @xmath3 as @xmath26 so that @xmath27  mev .",
    "furthermore @xmath28  mev is independent of @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ ca ] we plot the current algebra contribution to the real part of the @xmath4 partial wave amplitude , @xmath17 for increasing values of the number of colors @xmath3 .",
    "we observe that the unitarity bound is violated for a value of @xmath29 which increases linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "thus the net effect of increasing @xmath3 is to delay the onset of the unitarity bound violation . for @xmath30",
    "the unitarity bound is satisfied up to about 1  gev .",
    "thus the current algebra contribution alone indicates that @xmath3 should be of the order 13 to lead to a unitary chiral theory .",
    "we now demonstrate that this result is strongly modified by the presence of the well established @xmath31 companion of the pion  the @xmath8 vector meson .",
    "the amplitude we consider now is obtained by adding to the current algebra contribution the following vector meson @xmath32 contribution : @xmath33 \\ , \\label{arho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 coupling constant .",
    "also , @xmath36  mev is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath37 it should be noted that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ arho ] ) , which implies the existence of an additional non - resonant contact interaction other than the current algebra contribution , is required by the chiral symmetry when we include the @xmath8 vector meson contribution in a chiral invariant manner .",
    "although the vector meson contribution to the @xmath4 partial wave amplitude is due only to the crossed channel , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , adding the @xmath8(770 ) for the 3 color case greatly decreases the amount of unitarity violation .",
    "however for three colors this contribution is not sufficient to keep the scattering amplitude completely within the unitarity bounds and a broad state ( the sigma ) is needed  @xcite .",
    "here we follow a different route and investigate the unitarity bound restoration in the absence of the sigma as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we compute analytically the relevant partial wave projections . in fig .",
    "[ carho ] we plot the real part of the @xmath4 amplitude ( i.e. @xmath17 ) due to current algebra plus the @xmath8 contribution for increasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "since in this channel the vector meson is never on shell we suppress the contribution of the width in the vector meson propagator in eq .  ( [ arho ] ) .",
    "we observe that the unitarity bound ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) is satisfied for @xmath16 till well beyond the 1  gev region .",
    "however unitarity is still a problem for @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors . at energy scales larger than the one associated with the vector meson",
    "clearly other resonances are needed @xcite but we shall not be concerned about those here .",
    "it is also interesting to note that these considerations are essentially unchanged when the pion mass ( i.e. explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the lagrangian ) is set to zero .",
    "we also note that the curves in fig .",
    "[ carho ] are multiples of each other , so all of the extrema coincide as well as the points where the curves cross zero .",
    "this is so since the @xmath3 dependent scattering amplitude which is the sum of the current algebra and vector meson contributions obeys , by construction : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is defined replacing @xmath25 and @xmath43 with the @xmath3 independent quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45    scaling property in eq .",
    "( [ nc scaling ] ) is true for @xmath46 and @xmath47 where the width in the vector meson propagator in eq .",
    "( [ arho ] ) vanishes . ] .",
    "one might be worried that the critical value , @xmath2 determined by studying the @xmath4 channel would not hold for other channels .",
    "this is not so since @xmath4 is actually the worst channel with respect to unitarity bound violation at the low energies of present interest .",
    "indeed channels with larger @xmath48 have angular momentum suppression factors which delay the onset of such a violation .",
    "let us consider as a relevant example the @xmath15 channel .",
    "figure [ ca11 ] shows that , even including just the current algebra term , the unitarity bound is not an issue for 3 colors till energies well above the @xmath8 mass .     partial wave amplitude due to current algebra plotted for the following increasing values of @xmath3 ( from left to right ) , @xmath49 .",
    "the curve which first violates the unitarity bound corresponds to @xmath9.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the combined contributions of the vector meson @xmath8 term and the current algebra term in this channel as a function of the number of colors is shown in fig .",
    "[ carho11 ] . for this channel",
    "the non zero @xmath8 width has been of course taken into acount .",
    "the already narrow @xmath8 becomes more and more narrow as we increase @xmath3 while the @xmath3 effects are not very relevant concerning unitarity bounds .",
    "near the vector resonance we observe practically a breit - wigner consistent with the well known cancellation between the current algebra contribution and part of the non resonant vector meson contribution in chiral models .",
    "it is amusing that the vector meson plays a major role in helping satisfy the unitarity bound for large @xmath3 not in the direct channel but in the crossed one .",
    "it is also     partial wave amplitude due to the current algebra @xmath50 terms , plotted for the following increasing values of @xmath3 , @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath9 is the curve with the broadest @xmath8 meson.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    interesting that the critical number of colors emerges from the relation between @xmath52 , @xmath25 and @xmath53 while explicit chiral symmetry breaking has been seen to play a negligible role . notice that in the most crucial @xmath4 channel the vector meson width can be deleted to good accuracy and plays no role in satisfying the unitarity bound .",
    "thus apart from the truncation of higher mass resonant states the calculation of this partial wave is exactly that of the leading large @xmath3 approximation .",
    "we also note that the @xmath54 partial wave amplitude computed in this way obeys the unitarity bound to well above 1 gev @xcite .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that for @xmath16 and two flavor qcd the low energy theory is crossing symmetric and unitary up to well beyond the one gev region considering just the pion and the @xmath8 vector meson .",
    "this supports the usual expectation that when @xmath3 is large _ enough _ the meson - meson scattering theory is well represented by including just the relevant @xmath31 resonances at the tree level .",
    "in order to explain low energy @xmath0 scattering for the physical value @xmath9 ( and for the cases @xmath55 ) using the attractive notion of tree diagram dominance involving near by resonances , it thus seems necessary to include a scalar singlet resonance like the light sigma which is likely to be of  four quark \" type and hence not to contribute in the leading large @xmath3 approximation . as mentioned before ,",
    "many models @xcite-@xcite have recently been proposed which successfully employ the sigma in one way or another .",
    "some discussions of @xmath3 dependence have also been very recently given @xcite .",
    "using the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite it is easy to make a quick estimate of the mass of the needed sigma particle .",
    "a unitarization procedure is needed when the current algebra plus the @xmath8 amplitude first starts violating the unitarity bound .",
    "denote this point as @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath10 pole structure is such that the real part of its amplitude is positive for @xmath57 and negative for @xmath58 . identifying the squared sigma mass roughly with @xmath56",
    "will then give a negative contribution where the real part of the amplitude exceeds @xmath59 .",
    "in the case when only the current algebra term is included we get @xmath60 this shows that the squared mass of the sigma meson needed to restore unitarity for @xmath61 increases roughly linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "this estimate gets modified a bit when we include the vector meson ( see fig .  [ masse ] ) , yielding @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is to be obtained from fig .  [ carho ] .",
    "for which unitarity bounds are first violated as function of @xmath3 and normalized to @xmath64 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the pure current algebra contribution while the solid line to current algebra @xmath50 contribution.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in the case of three colors we then get @xmath65  mev which is close to the best fit to the @xmath0 scattering data determined in refs .  @xcite .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the possible four quark nature of the sigma .",
    "most naively , the needed particle is rather light while a usual constituent quark @xmath6 bound state should be a somewhat heavy p - wave state .",
    "of course we have been working in an effective lagrangian framework which does not directly tell us anything about the inner structure of the sigma meson .",
    "indirectly one can examine the three flavor generalization and observe that the lightest nine scalars found in the present manner have the right flavor quantum numbers to make up a usual nonet .",
    "however the characteristics of this nonet , such as usual vs. inverted mass ordering and the value of the mixing angle between the two isoscalars , turn out  @xcite to favor a four quark interpretation .",
    "still the four quarks may be of @xmath66 type @xcite , meson - meson molecule type @xcite or any linear combination .",
    "for our present purpose it is enough to know that they are not of @xmath6 type .",
    "we studied the dependence on number of colors of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "we showed the existence of a critical number of colors for and above which , chiral theory is unitary at leading order in the @xmath1 expansion to beyond the one gev range .",
    "the critical number of colors is @xmath2 and is insensitive to the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "for @xmath67 the @xmath31 resonances are sufficient to keep the low energy theory unitary . below this critical value",
    "the @xmath10 meson is needed to keep the amplitude within the unitarity bounds .",
    "this is a light , broad object which is unlikely to be of @xmath6 nature .",
