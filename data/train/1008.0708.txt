    "experimental progress in confining ultracold atoms in optical lattices has undergone spectacular progress in recent years .",
    "optical lattice potentials are extremely clean and controllable , and the excellent coherence properties of atomic condensates hold out the prospect of controlling their dynamics using quantum coherent methods .",
    "this is both interesting from the point of view of fundamental physics , and has many potential applications to quantum information processing , where it is vital that the coherence of the system is preserved during its time evolution .",
    "one such scheme is to use a time - periodic driving potential to induce the effect termed `` dynamical localization '' @xcite or `` coherent destruction of tunneling '' @xcite .",
    "this is a quantum interference effect in which a particle acquires a phase from its interaction with the driving potential , which leads to a renormalization of the single - particle tunneling probability . for specific values of the driving parameters",
    "the effective tunneling probability can be highly suppressed , providing a sensitive means of coherently controlling the localization of the atoms @xcite .",
    "this renormalization has recently been directly observed in cold atom experiments @xcite .    a convenient way of measuring the effective tunneling is to observe the rate of expansion of a condensate once a harmonic potential trapping the atoms along the direction of the optical lattice has been switched off @xcite .",
    "although the results of these experiments agreed well with the theoretically expected scaling of the renormalized tunneling probability with the bessel function of the driving strength , for particular initial conditions the scaling seemed to be _",
    "quadratic _ rather than linear in the bessel function . a number of explanations of this phenomenon",
    "have since been put forward , including a possible crossover from coherent to sequential tunneling @xcite induced by phase scrambling arising from dynamical instabilities , a time - averaging effect produced by finite time - resolution of the measurement @xcite , and driving - induced atom - pairing @xcite . a recent theoretical stability analysis",
    "@xcite has shown , however , that phase scrambling is unlikely to occur for the experimental parameters of refs .",
    "@xcite , and the pairing mechanism would require rather stronger interactions than were present in those experiments .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative explanation for the observed quadratic scaling of the renormalized tunneling probability based on the exact form of the expansion of the condensate , which is linear in the long time limit but quadratic for short times @xcite .",
    "using this complete time dependence in order to extract the tunneling probability from the experimental data gives quantitatively accurate agreement with theory , with no adjustable parameters .",
    "the bose - hubbard model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 & + & \\frac{u}{2 } \\sum_j n_j ( n_j - 1 ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_j v(r_j ) n_j , \\label{bose}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 are annihilation / creation operators for a boson on lattice site @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( taken to be positive ) describes the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbor sites @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the repulsive energy between two bosons occupying the same site .",
    "the operator @xmath6 is the standard number operator , and @xmath7 is the external trap potential , which is usually considered to be parabolic , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the trap frequency . although simple in appearance , the bose - hubbard model can provide an excellent description @xcite of ultracold atoms held in optical lattice potentials .    adding a static and a sinusoidally varying force to the system leads to the general time - dependent potential @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the static tilt applied to the lattice , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the amplitude and frequency , respectively , of the oscillating component .",
    "experimentally , the two forces are introduced into the rest frame of the optical lattice by applying appropriate frequency differences to the acousto - optic modulators creating the lattice beams , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "a time - periodic system of this type can be analyzed using floquet theory , revealing @xcite that the effect of the driving can be described by the static hamiltonian ( [ bose ] ) with a _ renormalized tunneling _",
    "for an untilted lattice ( @xmath15 ) this renormalization is given by the zeroth - order bessel function @xmath16 , where for convenience we define @xmath17 .",
    "thus at the values @xmath18 , at which the bessel function vanishes , the effective tunneling is suppressed .",
    "this effect thus provides a means to coherently control the dynamics of trapped atoms , without altering any of the parameters of the optical lattice .",
    "when the trap potential along the lattice direction is removed the atom cloud will expand in time , at a rate determined by @xmath14 . to quantify this process",
    "we calculate the spread of the wavefunction @xmath19 aligning the optical lattice with the @xmath20-axis .",
    "we begin by setting the hubbard interaction , @xmath5 , to zero . in the continuum approximation ,",
    "valid when the kinetic energy of the condensate is much less than the width of the first bloch band , the ground state of a parabolic trap is simply given by a gaussian , @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the normalization such that @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the harmonic trap - length .",
    "if the trap potential is now removed , this initial state will expand while _ remaining _ gaussian .",
    "this expansion can be calculated analytically @xcite yielding the result @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spacing of the optical lattice , and @xmath27 .",
    "similar , but more complicated , expressions were obtained by korsch @xcite using a lattice representation instead of the continuum approximation , which coincide with this result .",
    "the expansion clearly occurs in two different phases , separated by a crossover time @xmath28 . for long expansion times , @xmath29 ,",
    "the wavefunction spreads linearly with time , @xmath30 , reproducing the expected ballistic expansion of a released wavepacket . for short times , however , @xmath31 , the expansion is instead _ quadratic _ , @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to note that the expansion depends on both the magnitude of the tunneling , @xmath3 , as well as on the size of the initial wavepacket @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , a tightly - confined wavepacket will have a higher spread in momentum , and so will enter the regime of linear expansion more quickly . the extreme case where only a _",
    "lattice site is filled was considered in ref . , where it was found that the expansion was always linear with time .",

    "[ expansion ] ) we see that although on average the expansion of the driven condensate closely matches that of the static case with @xmath41 , the driven result contains small amplitude oscillations with the same frequency as the driving .",
    "these oscillations arise from the intrinsic time dependence of the floquet states themselves .",
    "their amplitude reduces as the driving frequency becomes larger , indicating that the approximation of modelling the driven system with a renormalized static hamiltonian becomes increasingly good .",
    "finally we also show in fig .",
    "[ expansion ] the most dramatic effect of the renormalization of tunneling . since @xmath16 , tuning @xmath49 to a zero of the bessel function should result in the complete suppression of tunneling ( neglecting next - nearest neighbor tunneling @xcite ) .",
    "we indeed see that setting @xmath43 results in the condensate not expanding with time , due to the vanishing of @xmath14 . similarly to the @xmath42 case",
    ", this curve again displays small oscillations , which become larger at low values of @xmath13 .",
    "this low frequency behaviour would correspond to the `` dynamical localization '' regime @xcite , where the wavepacket periodically returns to its initial state at stroboscopic times @xmath50 , but between these times can exhibit large excursions .    in ref .",
    "the effective tunneling was deduced by measuring the expansion rate of the condensate at a fixed time , and assuming this rate was directly proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "accordingly the ratio between the tunneling parameters in the static and the driven lattice was calculated as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the size of the condensate after expansion in the static lattice . for the experimental parameters ( @xmath53 nm and @xmath54 hz ) , we calculate a crossover time of @xmath55 ms for a weakly - interacting condensate released from a 20 hz harmonic trap . as the experiment employed an expansion time of 100 ms , the results",

    "this is due to the effect of higher - order hopping terms present in the system s dynamics .",

    "a tilt was applied to the lattice through a constant acceleration , leading to a suppression of tunneling by wannier - stark localization .",

    "the energy offset between two adjacent lattice wells then led to partial restoration of the tunneling probability , with the effective tunneling probability given by @xmath61 , i.e. one expects a scaling with the first - order bessel function . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , assuming linear expansion in order to extract @xmath62 led to a scaling that interpolated between a linear and a quadratic dependence on @xmath63 , depending on the initial size of the condensate ( which in the experiment was varied through the nonlinearity by changing the atom number ) .",

    "we have shown that in order to extract the effective tunneling from expansion measurements it is important to account for the detailed time - dependence of the condensate expansion .",
    "when the effective tunneling is small , or the initial width of the condensate is large , the crossover to ballistic expansion will not be reached until very long times .",
    "measurements made at earlier times will thus underestimate the effective tunneling rate , which gives a quantitatively accurate interpretation of the `` squared bessel function '' behaviour noted in refs . .",
