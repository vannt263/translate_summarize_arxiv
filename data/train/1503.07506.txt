    "nano crystals ( ncs )  particles the size of a few nanometers , consisting of many thousand atoms , usually capped with ligands  are building blocks of new materials with applications in various fields of modern engineering @xcite .",
    "much about them , especially about their interaction with other ncs , is known from experiments @xcite and molecular simulations @xcite , including simplified models @xcite . due to their complex structure and interaction behavior",
    ", a good theoretical knowledge is often missing .",
    "the precise shape of pair- and many - body - potentials , which determine the assembly of ncs into superstructures , is not well understood theoretically and is so far obtained best by molecular simulations @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate the effective pair potential employing models of density functional theory ( dft ) while relying on data from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the procedure allows for an accurate prediction of effective pair potentials at temperatures other than the temperature considered for the md simulation . to assess our approach , we run simulations with two thiol capped gold ncs for various temperatures ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . due to the large number of interaction sites ( 110k ) and",
    "the requirement of sufficiently long simulation runs computations of this kind are expensive .",
    "therefore , we try to reduce the number of necessary simulations and use all the information that is generated  not only the final estimates of the mean force .    for instance , we analyze trajectory data from our md simulations , determine the density of the relevant interaction sites at the ligand caps and apply their density to various fluid models of density functional theory ( dft ) . in doing",
    "so we neglect some of the ncs structure . for example , considering a chain model , we neglect the adsorption of the thiol ligand to the gold core , and considering an ideal gas , we even neglect molecular forces .",
    "how can such an approach be justified ?    the potential of mean force ( pmf ) will be represented by the difference of two helmholtz free energies @xcite ; the minuend is the free energy of the two ncs at focal distance , the subtrahend is the free energy of the ncs at infinite distance .",
    "therefore , any interaction that does not vary in strength when changing the ncs distance to each other will not contribute to the pmf .",
    "one example are the forces by which the ligands are absorbed to the gold surface , another example are the chemical bonds between the atoms in the thiols .",
    "that is , when calculating the pmf , one can neglect most of the ncs structure .",
    "+    for a set of five temperatures @xmath0 , constrained md simulations have been performed to determine the pmf @xmath1 between two exemplar ncs ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . following a united - atom approach with the lennard - jones force fields from schapotschnikow et al .",
    "@xcite , we consider the @xmath2- , @xmath3- and @xmath4-groups in the thiol ligands as single interaction sites .",
    "simulations were conducted as described in our previous work @xcite , using the gromacs software @xcite with a leap - frog stochastic dynamics integrator of step size @xmath5 and friction constant @xmath6 .",
    "this integrator also acts as a thermostat .",
    "for every temperature ( @xmath7 ) , 10 runs were performed in the nvt ensemble , each with an equilibration time of 1ns and a total runtime of @xmath8 , providing us with trajectories of 5000 coordinate snapshots .",
    "the centers of mass of the two ncs were aligned with the @xmath9-axis of the simulation box and their distance @xmath10 was fixed during a simulation by freezing the gold atoms in space . only in between simulations",
    "the distance was changed , incrementally ( @xmath11 ) , from large ( @xmath12 ) to small distances ( @xmath13 ) ; @xmath14 is the diameter of the core and @xmath15 is the length of the ligands . here",
    "we make two implicit assumptions @xcite : ( i ) the rotation of the ncs is negligible @xcite and ( ii ) the core - to - core interaction is unimportant compared to the ligand - to - ligand and ligand - to - core interactions @xcite .    to obtain the pmf",
    ", we evaluated the forces , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , that act on the centers of mass of the gold cores over the course of a simulation run .",

    "the potential at distance @xmath20 results from integration over larger distances , @xmath21 which in our discrete setting translates into @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , statistical errors become larger towards smaller distances @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .      as a special case of jarzynski s non - equilibrium equality @xcite",
    ", the pmf obtained from our md simulations can be represented by the difference of two helmholtz free energies , @xmath25 describing thermodynamic states of the ncs separated by a certain distance @xmath24 @xcite . in the context of the simulations , the limit @xmath26 in eq",
    ".   corresponds to a value at finite distance , @xmath27 .",
    "most naturally @xcite , the helmholtz energy is expanded in powers of the inverse temperature @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 defines boltzmann s constant .",
    "even if not indicated , the coefficients @xmath31 also depend on @xmath32 , but in the considered temperature range the dependence is unimportant .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 can be calculated using theoretical methods of statistical physics ( see sect .",
    "[ sectstatph ] below ) . in practice ,",
    "very few of them need to be known to reproduce the experimental data . for dispersive molecular interactions ( e.g. , the lennard - jones interactions between the molecular groups of our ncs ) , the first two are sufficient ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]ab ) , @xmath33    without experimental or theoretical knowledge , simulations for two @xcite or more temperatures @xmath34 are necessary to estimate the two coefficients . by applying the pseudo - inverse @xmath35 of the vandermonde matrix @xmath36 , @xmath37 we obtain a fit of the coefficients for any given number of simulations while ensuring that the fitting error @xmath38 is minimal , @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .    for di - polar interactions ,",
    "second order expansion is needed , etc . , and the number of necessary simulations and coefficients @xmath31 in eq .",

    "again , the best fit is achieved through eq .",
    "eq .   in a higher dimension .",
    "+      going back to the linear expansion eq .",
    ", let us consider the case of two unknown coefficients",
    ". then the pseudo - inverse reduces to the usual inverse . when inserting the resulting coefficients ( cf .",
    "( 2.1415 ) in @xcite ) into the expansion , @xmath40 one identifies the solution as linear interpolation for @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , one realizes that in accordance with the high temperature expansion the interpolation parameter is given by the inverse temperature .",
    "the interpolation results are shown in figure  [ fig2]d .",
    "now let us assume that one coefficient is given .",
    "then only one simulation ( performed at temperature @xmath42 , say ) is needed to calculate @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 is known , @xmath45 and if @xmath46 is known , @xmath47 these formulas are readily derived from eq .  ; note that the coefficients require the following adjustment , @xmath48 .",
    "+   +    to reduce the number of simulations , we will calculate the expansion coefficients in eq .   using three models of density functional theory ( sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] ) . by applying this methodology",
    "we must determine the density of the relevant interaction sites .",
    "naive sampling does not account for the momenta that are added to the nano system when coupled to a thermostat . during each time step @xmath49 ,",
    "the stochastic dynamics integrator adds randomly chosen momenta to the interaction sites @xcite .",
    "the center of mass and the tensor of inertia calculated from our simulation data fluctuate notably ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "therefore we propose a procedure that corrects for the unphysical interference ( cf .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "we re - adjust the center of mass and the tensor of inertia of our trajectory data by applying principal component analysis ( pca ) after each time step of a simulation run .",
    "that is , we move the lattice ( fig .  [",
    "fig3]c ) so that effectively we sample a density ( referred to as physical ) that keeps the center of mass and the tensor of inertia ( i.e. , because of rotational symmetry only the lowest eigenvalue ) of the nano system fixed . here",
    "averages over the 5000 time steps of a simulation run serve as reference values . in our simulations",
    "the gold cores are kept frozen in space , therefore we only correct the data of the ligand caps .    performing pca ( using the lapack software package @xcite ) , we observe one small- and two very similar large eigenvalues ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the eigenvectors of the two large eigenvalues form an almost steadily distributed circle around the @xmath9-axis ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to propose cylindrical symmetry for the density of the interaction sites in the cap , even though the cores of the ncs are icosahedras @xcite .",
    "this provides another , practical argument why performing our simulation by freezing the ncs cores in space ( and not only restraining their centers of mass and allowing for rotations ) is an acceptable simplification @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the high temperature expansion eq .   are determined by the molecular interaction .",
    "we recall that the partition function @xmath50 defines the helmholtz free energy @xmath51 in terms of the molecular potentials @xmath52 ; @xmath53 denotes the number of interaction sites , @xmath54 the pair potential between sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 the thermodynamic wavelength . here , perturbation theory , which model the transition of the free energy from a well - known reference fluid ( with pair potential @xmath58 ) to a target fluid ( with pair potential @xmath59 ) , defines the coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature expansion , eq .  , reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the perturbation and @xmath63 denotes the corresponding average for the canonical ensemble of the reference fluid .",
    "examples are content of the subsequent section .",
    "three thermodynamic models will be used to calculate one of the expansion coefficients in eq .  .",
    "relying on linear expansion eq .  , md simulations for only one reference temperature ( e.g. , @xmath64 ) are needed to determine the pmf for any other temperature @xmath0 ; see eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "we reconstruct pmfs for the available set of simulations and explain the intricacies when applying the models .",
    "we start off with the simplest one .      here",
    "we assume that the entropic contribution ( i.e. , the coefficient @xmath65 ) represents an ideal gas .",
    "it is , however , the ideal gas contribution of a heterogeneous fluid with a density distribution obtained from the md simulation . given a continuous particle density , @xmath66 , as @xmath67 , the ideal gas contribution is known ( for classical fluids ) as @xmath68 this formula can be simplified when only taking differences of the helmholtz free energy , @xmath69 according to eq .  , the difference concerns two states : one , where the ncs are located at a distance @xmath24 apart from each other and , another , where one of two ncs is separated to infinity .",
    "we thereby assume that the intra - molecular partition sum is unchanged for the two states modeled with eq .  .",
    "the result represents shannon s entropy @xcite .",
    "its only input is the particle density , which can be obtained from trajectory data . while considering differences of the free energy , we restrict ourselves to interaction sites that markedly change the position with respect to ( the center of mass of ) their nc when moving the ncs in space .",
    "these interaction sites are the @xmath70-groups ( i.e. , @xmath3- and @xmath4-groups ) of the thiol chains .",
    "the simplicity of this approach is deceiving .",
    "the density in our formulas is a continuous quantity , but the positional coordinates of the interaction sites obtained from an md simulation are determined for discrete time steps .",
    "we find that a cubic lattice with mesh size @xmath71 allows for sampling a reliable discrete density , leading to reproducible values for the helmholtz free energy .",
    "yet these values turn out to be ca .",
    "20% too large compared to the predicted values ( cf .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "we believe the discrepancy is due to the thermostat .",
    "the stochastic dynamics integrator used in the simulations randomly adds momenta to the molecular groups .",
    "this is exactly what we observe from the trajectory data .",
    "the center of mass and the tensor of inertia of the interaction sites fluctuate over time ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]ab ) , despite the fact that the molecular groups of the two ncs are the only particles simulated in space .    to correct for the unaccounted physical interaction we utilize a density obtained through pca , ending up with an entropic contribution that is significantly smaller than the one obtained from naive sampling . above a certain distance of the ncs ,",
    "@xmath72 , the agreement of our prediction with the @xmath44-data ( as determined from md simulations at various temperatures ) is very good ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .    in order to appreciate this result",
    ", we note that an accurate prediction of @xmath44 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) leads to a reliable estimate of the pmf for any temperature ( via eq .  )",
    "using md simulation data of only one temperature .",
    "the predicted pmf at various temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b .",
    "+   +      a much more advanced model for the thiol ligands of our ncs is given by wertheim s theory of hard - sphere chains @xcite .",
    "here the entropic contribution represents a chain with @xmath73 hard - sphere segments , containing carnahan - starling s term @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous approach ( ideal gas model ) , the ideal gas term is neglected @xcite here , because now the reference ideal gas state is one where interaction sites are considered free ( unconstrained to chain structure ) . the ideal gas contribution",
    "then cancels in the difference of eq .  .",
    "the reference fluid ( term of zero order ) is @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the packing fraction and @xmath76 the hard - sphere diameter . according to tarazona",
    "@xcite , a weighted particle density @xmath77 is utilized , computed from the physical density @xmath78 .    to determine the two parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath76",
    ", we use a homo - segmented group contribution method @xcite , where the thiol chains are composed by a fractional number ( @xmath79 , by  eq .  2 in @xcite ) of associating hard - sphere segments with equal diameter ( @xmath80 , by  eq .  3 in @xcite ) and hence equal volume ( @xmath81 )",
    "figure [ fig4]cd shows the results . similar to the ideal gas model , the fit is very good for distances of the two ncs above @xmath82 .",
    "lo verso et al .",
    "@xcite also used a chain model for a similar but artificial nano system , where the density @xmath78 was sampled naively .",
    "in contrast to our ideal gas model , no involvement of the thermostat and no dependence on the mesh size has been reported .",
    "in fact , this coincides with our observations .",
    "when applying the naive density to our chain model we obtain almost the same results as when applying the physical density .",
    "this could be due to the weighted particle density and its smoothing behavior .",
    "one has to be careful though when implementing eq .   on a lattice ; the lattice must be fine enough to sufficiently represent a single hard - sphere volume @xmath83 by summation over its cells .      in our third model",
    "we take a different approach . rather than estimating the reference fluid @xmath44",
    ", we now estimate the @xmath46 term ( via eq .  ) .",
    "the approach is similar in practical application , because the respective other term ( @xmath44 or @xmath46 ) is determined by md simulations and eq .  .",
    "we consider the ligand segments as a lennard - jones fluid .",
    "that is , we apply the force field that was used in the md simulation , @xmath84 .",
    "however , we only consider the @xmath70-groups as interaction sites , and we only compute the interaction term in first order perturbation theory , @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the perturbation and @xmath87 the pair distribution of the reference fluid . as reference fluid we consider hard - spheres , and numerically we approximate their pair distribution using the percus - yevik s method @xcite . we apply two standard theories : the one by barker - henderson ( bh ) @xcite and the one by week - chandler - andersen ( wca ) @xcite .",
    "the density @xmath78 is sampled again from the simulated trajectories after pca is performed .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig4]ef .",
    "the fitting is very good above the distance @xmath82 .",
    "naive sampling produces slightly worse results .    bh performs better than wca .",
    "this is a bit surprising , as bh s higher order terms  unlike wca  usually also contribute to eq .  .",
    "maybe the choice of the reference fluid with an only temperature dependent hard - sphere diameter is responsible .",
    "bh s reference potential is steeper than wca s and thus closer to a hard - sphere fluid .",
    "the computational effort of summing over all interactions eq .",
    "is much higher than in the previous two methods .",
    "we took advantage of cylindrical and mirror symmetry when sampling the particle density , reducing the computation time by the factor @xmath88 .",
    "for an exemplar system of two thiol capped gold core ncs we estimated the pmf using three models . above a critical distance ( @xmath89 ) , each of the three models led to pmf curves of satisfactory quality .",
    "the methods underlying these models differ considerably with respect to the number of input parameters and the computational effort .",
    "the ideal gas model returned the best pmfs and requires no extra parameters .",
    "yet one must correct the simulated particle distribution via pca to obtain a physical density .",
    "as md simulations usually involve ( virtual ) interaction with a thermostat , our correction should be relevant for many similar problems .",
    "one disadvantage of this methodology is the additional computational cost ( when performing pca for 5000 data sets ) , but it is far less than the cost of possibly additional md simulations .",
    "the hard - sphere chain model requires knowledge of two additional parameters , the hard - sphere diameter and the chain length .",
    "both these parameters were obtained independently from a homo - segmented group contribution method .",
    "the fit of the pmf - data is almost as good as with the ideal gas model .",
    "for further improvement , one may try to employ a hetero - segmented method @xcite . because of the weighted density that enters the formulas , the model turned out to be robust with respect to small imprecisions of the particle density .",
    "that is , compared to the ideal gas model , no pca correction is needed .",
    "therefore , the computational cost is smaller too .",
    "the lennard - jones model , did not perform as well as the other two models , in particular for small nc - distances .",
    "there are several possible reasons .",
    "the radial pair distribution function for spheres is only a rough approximation for the pair distribution of heavily structured ncs @xcite . for densely overlapping ligands ( i.e. , nc - distances @xmath90 ) , the sum over the lennard - jones interactions turned out too high .",
    "furthermore , we introduced a lattice of rather big mesh size , because summation over all the attractive forces is costly and extends with cubic power .",
    "the proposed rotational and mirror symmetries for the lattice entries will have contributed to errors as well .    in each of the three models ,",
    "the nc ligand layer is studied as a fluid . taking this aspect of the approach seriously and regarding the ligand layer as a solvent for the core , we are able to clarify the role of an additional force observed at small distances of the ncs , as explained now",
    ".       +    the change in monotony of the entropic coefficient @xmath91 around the critical distance @xmath92 and the relatively small error bounds ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) suggest that there is an additional attractive force @xmath93 not yet accounted for in our models .",
    "let us assume that this force behaves according to hook s law with spring constant @xmath94  with onset at distance @xmath95 and becoming larger at smaller distances of the two ncs .",
    "the additional contribution to the pmf would then be quadratic , @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the heaviside function .",
    "we adjusted the parameters , @xmath98 and @xmath94 , to the pmf - data generated by the md simulation .",
    "the best result is achieved for a onset distance @xmath99 slightly above the critical distance @xmath100 ; the regression shows excellent agreement with the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ) , with error values similar to @xcite .",
    "the harmonic ansatz function , eq .  , represents the simplest form of a depletion force @xcite . in practice ,",
    "adjusting the parameter @xmath101 requires one additional md simulation .",
    "the additional simulation is in conflict with our objective to reduce the simulation effort to a single md run , and for many applications it is sufficient to simply neglect the short - ranged potential , eq .  .",
    "nonetheless , from a more fundamental viewpoint we are interested in elaborating the force further , showing that the short - ranged force contribution is indeed likely the result of a depletion force . in doing so , we show that the distance parameter @xmath98 can be estimated from geometric data .",
    "depletion forces between two ncs are apparently attractive forces .",
    "the effect is caused by the depletion of smaller entities ( here interaction sites of the ligands ) between the ncs due to geometrical size exclusion .",
    "as a result , the local density of ligands between the ncs is taking on small values , leading to a low local pressure .",
    "the depletion forces are thus attractive .",
    "depletion has been used to explain phenomena in the context of nano - sized particles  with polymer parts taking over the role of solvent particles @xcite .    in our nano system , only the @xmath70-groups move and thus mimic solvent particles .",
    "therefore , depletion attraction is supposed start at ( or slightly above ) the distance where only one @xmath3-group fits in between the two ncs .    the considered @xmath3-group is bound to a @xmath2-group , which is bonded rather immobile to the gold core of one nc ( # 1 , say ) .",
    "the surface of the other gold core ( of nc2 ) is densely covered with @xmath2-groups ( cf .",
    "[ figa1]b ) .",
    "the average distance of the two ncs , @xmath102 , where the first @xmath3-group of nc1 touches the @xmath2-group surface of nc2 , should then be an estimate for the onset distance @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , we found that numerically the optimal onset distance coincides with @xmath103 up to @xmath104 ( which is far below mesh size @xmath105 ) ; here @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the mean radii of the @xmath2- and the first @xmath3-groups about the gold cores ( obtained from trajectory data ; cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , and @xmath108 represents the average distance between the centers of @xmath3 ( nc1 ) and @xmath2 ( nc2 ) over the bumpy @xmath2-surface of nc2 ( calculated in appendix  [ seca ] ) .       +    to test the range of validity we performed md - simulations for pairs of ncs with other core sizes and ligand lengths , and we also studied heterogeneous nc pairs @xcite .",
    "for all these cases the modeling approach is in good agreement with a series of independent md results ( cf .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it needs to be examined , however , if for more extreme dimensions ( e.g. , very long ligands ) and for other core and/or cap materials our methodology leads to comparably good results .",
    "after two - body interaction , three - body interaction must be studied @xcite .",
    "looking at the geometric structure of the ncs , one can not recognize a simple rule that determines the positions of the @xmath2-groups adsorbed to the @xmath109-icosahedra .",
    "it is known , however , that for the ncs considered here , there are @xmath110 ligands adsorbed to the gold surface and that this number represents the densest packing @xcite . for the analysis in this appendix , we consider lennard - jones interaction sites as hard spheres of diameter @xmath76 .    for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath2-surface is a large sphere on which the @xmath2-groups are regularly distributed .",
    "that is , one would propose that the @xmath2-surface is tiled by hexagons with a @xmath2-group in the center .",
    "then one only needs to study three @xmath2-groups , and the only unknown parameter is the distance @xmath111 between the boundaries of two neighboring @xmath2-spheres ( cf .",
    "[ figa1 ] ) .    assuming that the hexagonal tiling covers all the @xmath2-groups distributed around the gold core at mean distance @xmath112 , @xmath113 where @xmath114 represents the hexagon area surrounding one @xmath2-group , the distance between the boundaries can be estimated by @xmath115    regarding depletion , we propose that the first @xmath3-groups ( following @xmath2 ) are the parts of the ligands that undergo depletion for small nc - distances . over a triangular region ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ figa1 ] , the hard - sphere diameters ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xcite ) determine the contact distances between the first @xmath3-group of nc1 ( cyan ) and three neighboring @xmath2-groups of nc2 ( red ) .",
    "these contact distances ( i.e. , before depletion starts ) are calculated by @xmath118 this formula only applies to a particular part of the equilateral triangle . due to symmetry , it is sufficient to average over one sixth of the surface ( e.g. , the triangle given by the points @xmath119 with @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 ( where @xmath123 defines the hypotenuse of that triangle ; illustrated by dots in fig .  [ figa1]a ) . note that the center of the three @xmath2-spheres is slightly below their mean radial distance from the gold core ; the offset is given by @xmath124 .",
    "a similar correction is included for the @xmath3-sphere , @xmath125 , where locally @xmath126 defines the projection of @xmath127 onto the core - to - core direction .",
