    "for well over a century , radial velocities for objects outside the solar system have been determined through spectroscopy , using the ( doppler ) shifts of stellar spectral lines .",
    "the advent of high - accuracy ( sub - milliarcsec ) astrometric measurements , both on ground and in space , now permits radial velocities to be obtained by alternative methods , based on geometric principles and therefore independent of spectroscopy .",
    "the importance of such _ astrometric radial velocities _ stems from the fact that they are independent of phenomena which affect the spectroscopic method , such as line asymmetries and shifts caused by atmospheric pulsation , surface convection , stellar rotation , stellar winds , isotopic composition , pressure , and gravitational potential .",
    "conversely , the differences between spectroscopic and astrometric radial velocities may provide information on these phenomena that can not be obtained by other methods . although the theoretical possibility of deducing astrometric radial velocities from geometric projection effects was noted already at the beginning of the 20th century ( if not earlier )",
    ", it is only recently that such methods have reached an accuracy level permitting non - trivial comparison with spectroscopic measurements .",
    "we have analysed three methods by which astrometric radial velocities can be determined ( fig .",
    "[ fig : methods ] ) .",
    "two of them are applicable to individual , nearby stars and are based on the well understood secular changes in the stellar trigonometric parallax and proper motion .",
    "the third method uses the apparent changes in the geometry of a star cluster or association to derive its kinematic parameters , assuming that the member stars share , in the mean , a common space velocity . in sects .",
    "[ sec : pidot ] to [ sec : mcm ] we describe the principle and underlying assumptions of each of the three methods and derive approximate formulae for the expected accuracy of resulting astrometric radial velocities .",
    "for the first and second methods , an inventory of nearby potential target stars is made , and the second method is applied to several of these .",
    "however , given currently available astrometric data , only the third ( moving - cluster ) method is capable of yielding astrophysically interesting , sub - km  s@xmath1 accuracy . in subsequent papers we develop in detail the theory of this method , based on the maximum - likelihood principle , as well as its practical implementation , and apply it to a number of nearby open clusters and associations , using data from the hipparcos astrometry satellite .",
    "in the following sections , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the trigonometric parallax of a star , its ( total ) proper motion , and its radial velocity .",
    "the components of @xmath3 in right ascension and declination are denoted @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the dot signifies a time derivative , as in @xmath8 .",
    "the statistical uncertainty ( standard error ) of a quantity @xmath9 is denoted @xmath10 .",
    "( we prefer this non - standard notation to @xmath11 , since @xmath9 is itself often a subscripted variable . )",
    "@xmath12 is used for the physical velocity dispersion in a cluster . @xmath13",
    "km is the astronomical unit ; the equivalent values @xmath14  km  yr  s@xmath1 and @xmath15  mas  km  yr  s@xmath1 are conveniently used in equations below ( cf .",
    "table  1.2.2 in vol .  1 of esa @xcite ) .",
    "other notations are explained as they are introduced .",
    "in estimating the potential accuracy of the different methods , we consider three hypothetical situations :    * case a : a quasi - continuous series of observations over a few years , resulting in an accuracy of @xmath16  mas ( milliarcsec ) for the trigonometric parallaxes and @xmath17  mas  yr@xmath1 for the proper motions . * case b : similar to case  a , only a thousand times better , i.e.   @xmath16  @xmath3as ( microarcsec ) and @xmath17  @xmath3as  yr@xmath1 . * case c : _ two _ sets of measurements , separated by an interval of 50  yr , where each set has the same accuracy as in case  b. the much longer - time baseline obviously allows a much improved determination of the accumulated changes in parallax and proper motion .",
    "the accuracies assumed in case  a are close to what the hipparcos space astrometry mission ( esa @xcite ) achieved for its main observation programme of more than 100@xmath18000 stars .",
    "current ground - based proper motions may be slightly better than this , but not by a large factor .",
    "this case therefore represents , more or less , the state - of - the - art accuracy in optical astrometry .",
    "accuracies in the 1 to 10  @xmath3as range are envisaged for some planned or projected space astrometry missions , such as gaia ( lindegren & perryman @xcite ) and sim ( unwin et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "the duration of such a mission is here assumed to be about 5  years . using the longer - time baselines available with ground - based techniques , similar performance may in the future be reached with the most accurate ground - based techniques ( pravdo & shaklan @xcite ; shao @xcite ) .",
    "case  b therefore corresponds to what we could realistically hope for within one or two decades .",
    "case  c , finally , probably represents an upper limit to what is practically feasible in terms of long - term proper - motion accuracy , not to mention the patience of astronomers .",
    "the most direct and model - independent way to determine radial velocity by astrometry is to measure the secular change in the trigonometric parallax ( fig .  [",
    "fig : methods]a ) . the distance @xmath19 ( from the solar system barycentre )",
    "is related to parallax @xmath2 through @xmath20 . since @xmath21 ,",
    "the radial velocity is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the astronomical unit ( sect .",

    "( [ eq : pidot ] ) was derived by schlesinger ( @xcite ) , who concluded that the parallax change is very small for every known star . however , although extremely accurate parallax measurements are obviously required , the method is not as unrealistic as it may seem at first . to take a specific , if extreme , example : for barnard s star ( gl  699  =  hip  87937 ) , with @xmath24  mas and @xmath25  km  s@xmath1 , the expected parallax rate is @xmath26as  yr@xmath1 . according to our discussion in sect .  [",
    "sec : acc ] this will almost certainly be measurable in the near future .",
    "it can be noted that the changing - parallax method , in contrast to the methods described in sect .",
    "[ sec : mudot ] and [ sec : mcm ] , does not depend on the object having a large and uniform space motion , and would therefore be applicable to all stars within a few parsecs of the sun .",

    "the achievable accuracy in @xmath28 depends both on the individual astrometric measurements and on their number and distribution in time . concerning the temporal distribution of the measurements we consider two limiting situations :    _ quasi - continuous observation .",
    "_ the measurements are more or less uniformly spread out over a time period of length @xmath30 centred on the epoch @xmath31 .",
    "this is a good approximation to the way a single space mission would typically be operated ; for example , hipparcos had @xmath32  yr and @xmath33 .",
    "in such a case there exist simple ( mean ) relations between how accurately the different astrometric parameters of the same star can be derived , depending on @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , @xmath34 , if @xmath35 is the accuracy of the proper motion in declination and @xmath36 that of the declination at @xmath31 .",

    "_ two isolated parallax or proper - motion measurements are taken , separated by a long time interval ( say , @xmath37 years ) during which no observation takes place .",
    "each measurement must actually be the result of a series covering at least a year or so , but the duration of each such series is assumed to be negligible compared with @xmath37 .",
    "this could be two similar space missions separated by several decades and is applicable to case  c in sect .",

    "( [ eq : epspidota ] ) and ( [ eq : epspidotb ] ) , that the radial - velocity error is simply a function of distance . the number of potential target stars for a certain maximum radial - velocity uncertainty is therefore given by the total number of stars within the corresponding maximum distance .",
    "table  [ tab : epspidot ] gives the actual numbers of such stars , and the observational accuracies that may be reached .",
    "to a good approximation , single stars move with uniform linear velocity through space . for a given linear tangential velocity , the angular velocity ( or proper motion @xmath3 ) , as seen from the sun , varies inversely with the distance to the object .",
    "however , the tangential velocity changes due to the varying angle between the line of sight and the space - velocity vector ( fig .  [ fig : methods]b ) . as is well known ( e.g.  van de kamp @xcite , murray @xcite ) the two effects combine to produce an apparent ( perspective ) acceleration of the motion on the sky , or a rate of change in proper motion amounting to @xmath53 .",
    "with @xmath54 we find @xmath55 schlesinger ( @xcite ) derived the equivalent of this equation , calculated the perspective acceleration for kapteyn s and barnard s stars ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : epsmudot ] ) and noted that , if accurate positions are acquired over long periods of time , `` we shall be in position to determine the radial velocities of these stars independently of the spectroscope and with an excellent degree of precision '' .",
    "the equation for the perspective acceleration was earlier derived by seeliger ( @xcite ) and used by ristenpart ( @xcite ) in an ( unsuccessful ) attempt to determine @xmath56 observationally for groombridge  1830 .",
    "a major consideration for ristenpart seems to have been the possibility to derive the parallax from the apparent acceleration in combination with a spectroscopic radial velocity .",
    "such a determination of ` acceleration parallaxes ' was also considered by eichhorn ( @xcite ) .",

    "one difficulty with the method has been that the positions and motions of the reference stars are themselves not accurately known , and that small errors in the reference data could cause a spurious acceleration of the target star ( van de kamp @xcite ) .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue ( esa @xcite ) established a very accurate and homogeneous positional reference frame over the whole sky . using the proper motions ,",
    "this reference frame can be extrapolated backwards in time .",
    "it is then possible to re - reduce measurements of old photographic plates , and express even century - old stellar positions in the same reference frame as modern observations .",
    "this should greatly facilitate the determination of effects such as the perspective acceleration , which are sensitive to systematic errors in the reference frame .",
    "as part of the _ carte du ciel _ project begun more than a century ago , an astrographic programme to measure the positions of all stars down to the 11th magnitude was carried out and published as the astrographic catalogue , ac ( see eichhorn @xcite for a description ) .",
    "after transfer to electronic media , the position measurements have been reduced to the hipparcos reference frame ( nesterov et al .",
    "@xcite , urban et al .",
    "the result is a positional catalogue of more than 4  million stars with a mean epoch around 1907 and a typical accuracy of about 200  mas .",
    "we have used the version known as ac  2000 ( urban et al .",
    "@xcite ) , available on cd - rom from the us naval observatory , to examine the old positions of all the stars with hip identifiers in table  [ tab : epsmudot ] .    for the stars in table  [ tab : ac ]",
    "we successfully matched the ac positions with the positions extrapolated backwards from the hipparcos catalogue and hence could calculate the astrometric radial velocities .",
    "other potential targets in table  [ tab : epsmudot ] were either outside the magnitude range of ac  2000 ( e.g.  @xmath61  cen and proxima ) or lacked an accurate proper motion from hipparcos ( e.g.  van maanen  2 and hip  91768 + 91772 ) .",
    "the basic procedure was as follows .",
    "the rigorous epoch transformation algorithm described in sect .",
    "1.5.5 of the hipparcos catalogue , vol .  1 , was used to propagate the hipparcos position and its covariance matrix to the ac  2000 epoch relevant for each star .",
    "this extrapolated position was compared with the actual measured position in ac  2000 , assuming a standard error of 200  mas in each coordinate for the latter .",
    "a @xmath142 goodness - of - fit was then calculated from the position difference and the combined covariance of the extrapolated and measured positions .",
    "the epoch transformation algorithm requires that the radial velocity is known .",
    "the radial velocity was therefore varied until the @xmath142 attained its minimum value .",
    "the @xmath1431@xmath144 confidence interval given in the table was obtained by modifying the radial velocity until the @xmath142 had increased by one unit above the minimum .",
    "for some of the stars , data had to be corrected for duplicity or known orbital motion .",
    "the solutions for the resolved binary 61  cyg ( hip  104214 + 104217 ) refer to the mass centre , assuming a mass ratio of @xmath145 , as estimated by means of standard isochrones from the absolute magnitudes and colour indices of the components ( sderhjelm , private communication ) . for the astrometric binary @xmath3  cas ( hip  5336 ) the hipparcos data explicitly refer to the mass centre using the orbit by heintz & cantor ( @xcite ) ;",
    "the same orbit was used to correct the ac position of the primary to the mass centre .",
    "no correction for orbital motion was used for gx  and and 40  eri .",
    "table  [ tab : ac ] gives two solutions for 61  cyg .",
    "the first solution was obtained as described above , using only the hipparcos data plus the ac positions for the two components .",
    "the second solution , marked with an asterisk in the table , was derived by including also the observations by bessel ( @xcite ) from his pioneering determination of the star s parallax .",
    "bessel measured the angular distances from the geometrical centre ( half - way between the components ) of 61  cyg to two reference stars , called @xmath146 and @xmath19 in his paper .",
    "after elimination of aberration , proper motion and parallax , he found the distances @xmath147  arcsec and @xmath148  arcsec for the beginning of year 1838 ( b1838.0 = j1838.0022 ) .",
    "the uncertainties are our estimates ( standard errors ) based on the scatter of the residuals in bessel s solution ` ii ' .",
    "we identified the reference stars in ac  2000 and in the tycho catalogue ( esa @xcite ) as @xmath146 = ac  1382543 = tyc  3168  708  1 and @xmath19 = ac  1382712 = tyc  3168  1106  1 . extrapolating the positions from these catalogues back",
    "to b1838 allowed us to compute the position of the geometrical centre of 61  cyg in the hipparcos / tycho reference frame .",
    "this could then be transformed to the position of the mass centre , using bessel s own measurement of the separation and position angle in 61  cyg and the previously assumed mass ratio .",
    "actually , all the available data were combined into a @xmath142 goodness - of - fit measure and the radial velocity was varied in order to find the minimum and the @xmath1431@xmath144 confidence interval .",
    "this gave @xmath149  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "table  [ tab : ac ] also gives the spectroscopic radial velocities when available in the literature .",
    "a comparison between the astrometric and spectroscopic radial velocities is made in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] . given the stated confidence intervals , the agreement is in all cases rather satisfactory .",
    "the exercise demonstrates the basic feasibility of this method , but also hints at some of the difficulties in applying it to non - single stars .",
    "the moving - cluster method is based on the assumption that the stars in a cluster move through space essentially with a common velocity vector .",
    "the radial - velocity component makes the cluster appear to contract or expand due to its changing distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : methods]c ) .",
    "the relative rate of apparent contraction equals the relative rate of change in distance to the cluster .",
    "this can be converted to a linear velocity ( in km  s@xmath1 ) if the distance to the cluster is known , e.g.  from trigonometric parallaxes . in practice",
    ", the method amounts to determining the space velocity of the cluster , i.e.  the convergent point and the speed of motion , through a combination of proper motion and parallax data .",
    "once the space velocity is known , the radial velocity for any member star may be calculated by projecting the velocity vector onto the line of sight .",
    "the method can be regarded as an inversion of the classical procedure ( e.g.  binney & merrifield @xcite ) by which the distances to the stars in a moving cluster are derived from the proper motions and ( spectroscopic ) radial velocities : if instead the distances are known , the radial velocities follow .",
    "the first application of the classical moving - cluster method for distance determination was by klinkerfues ( @xcite ) , in a study of the ursa major system .",
    "the possibility to check spectroscopic radial velocities against astrometric data was recognised by klinkerfues , but could not then be applied to the ursa major cluster due to the lack of reliable trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "this changed with hertzsprung s ( @xcite ) discovery that sirius probably belongs to the ursa major moving group .",
    "the relatively large and well - determined parallax of sirius , combined with its considerable angular distance from the cluster apex , could lead to a meaningful estimate for the cluster velocity and hence for the radial velocities .",
    "rasmuson ( @xcite ) and smart ( @xcite ) appear to have been among the first who actually made this computation , although mainly as a means of verifying the cluster method for distance determination .",
    "later studies by petrie ( @xcite ) and petrie & moyls ( @xcite ) reached formal errors in the astrometric radial velocities below 1  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the last paper concluded `` there does not appear to be much likelihood of improving the present results until a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the trigonometric parallaxes becomes possible . ''",
    "one of the purposes of the petrie & moyls study was to derive the astrometric radial velocities of spectral type a in order to check the victoria system of spectroscopic velocities .",
    "the method was also applied to the hyades ( petrie @xcite ) but only with an uncertainty of a few km  s@xmath1 . given the expected future availability of more accurate proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes , petrie ( @xcite ) envisaged that one or two moving clusters could eventually be used as primary radial - velocity standards for early - type spectra .",
    "such astrometric data are now in fact available . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3prec ] we derive a rough estimate of the accuracy of the method and survey nearby clusters and associations in order to find promising targets for its application .",
    "an important consideration is to what extent systematic velocity patterns in the cluster , in particular cluster expansion , will limit the achievable accuracy .",
    "this is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:3syst ] and appendix  a. in sect .",
    "[ sec : indpar ] we briefly consider the improvement in the distance estimates for individual stars resulting from the moving - cluster method .",
    "the present discussion of the moving - cluster method is only intended to highlight its theoretical potential and limitations .",

    "this implies an linear separation of at least some 50000  astronomical units , or a few degrees on the sky at 10  pc distance . in principle , then , this case is equivalent to a moving cluster with @xmath180 stars .    in the opposite case of a ( relatively ) short - period binary",
    ", the radial velocity might be obtained from apparent changes of the orbit .",
    "the projected orbit will not be closed , but form a spiral on the sky : slightly diverging if the stars are approaching , slightly converging if they recede . for a system at a distance of 10  pc , say , with a component separation of 10  astronomical units , a radial velocity of 100  km  s@xmath1 will change the apparent orbital radius of 1  arcsec by 10  @xmath3as per year .",
    "the relative positions would need to be measured during at least a significant fraction of an orbital period , or some 20  years in our example , resulting in an accumulated change by about 0.2  mas .",
    "since only relative position measurements between the same stars are required , the observational challenges are not as severe as in some other cases . for a binary with a few arcsec separation ,",
    "the isoplanatic properties of the atmosphere imply that the cross - correlation distance between the speckle images of both stars should be stable to better than one mas .",
    "averaging very many exposures should reduce the errors into the @xmath3as range , with practical limits possibly set by differential refraction ( mcalister @xcite ) .",
    "the moving - cluster method ( sect .",
    "[ sec : mcm ] ) could in principle be applied also to globular clusters .",
    "globular clusters differ markedly from open clusters in that ( potentially ) many more stars could be measured , and through a much larger velocity dispersion ( @xmath181  km  s@xmath1 ; peterson & king @xcite ) .",
    "the higher number of stars partly compensates the larger dispersion .",
    "however , all globular clusters are rather distant , making their angular radii small . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:3prec ] the approximate formula @xmath182 applies in the case when the internal motions are well resolved .",
    "taking @xmath18320  arcmin as representative for the angular radii of comparatively nearby globular clusters , we find that averaging over some @xmath184 to @xmath185 member stars is needed to reach a radial - velocity accuracy comparable with @xmath12 , i.e.  several km  s@xmath1 . furthermore , in view of the discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec:3syst ] , it is not unlikely that the complex kinematic structures of these objects ( e.g.  norris et al .",
    "@xcite ) would bias the results .",
    "thus , globular clusters remain difficult targets for astrometric radial - velocity determination .",
    "the theoretical possibility to use astrometric data ( parallax and proper motion ) to deduce the radial motions of stars has long been recognised . with the highly accurate ( sub - milliarcsec ) astrometry already available or foreseen in planned space missions ,",
    "such radial - velocity determinations are now also a practical possibility .",
    "this will have implications for the future definition of radial - velocity standards , as the range of geometrically determined accurate radial velocities , hitherto limited to the solar system and to solar - type spectra , is extended to many other stellar types represented in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we have identified and analysed three main methods to determine astrometric radial velocities .",
    "the first method , using the changing annual parallax , is the intuitively most obvious one , but requires data of an accuracy beyond current techniques .",
    "it is nevertheless potentially interesting in view of future space missions or long - term observations from the ground .",
    "the second method , using the changing proper motion or perspective acceleration of stars , has a long history , and was previously applied to a few objects , albeit with modest precision in the resulting radial velocity .",
    "new results for a greater number of stars , obtained by combining old and modern data , were given in table  [ tab : ac ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] , thus proving the concept . however , to realise the full potential of the method again requires the accuracies of future astrometry projects .    in both these methods the uncertainty in the astrometric radial velocity increases ,",
    "statistically , with distance squared .",
    "they are therefore in practice limited to relatively few stars very close to the sun and , in the second method , to stars with a large tangential velocity . in the general case",
    ", the two methods could actually be combined to yield a somewhat higher accuracy , but at least for the stars considered in tables  [ tab : epspidot ] and [ tab : epsmudot ] this would only bring a marginal improvement .",
    "the third method , using the changing angular extent of a moving cluster or association , is an inversion of the classical moving - cluster method , by which the distance to the cluster was derived from its radial velocity and convergence point .",
    "if the distance is known from trigonometric parallaxes , one can instead calculate the radial velocities .",
    "it appears to be the only method by which astrophysically interesting accuracies can be obtained with existing astrometric data . in future papers",
    "we will develop and exploit this possibility in full , using data from the hipparcos mission .",
    "a by - product of the method is that the distance estimates to individual cluster stars may be significantly improved compared with the parallax measurements .",
    "one would perhaps expect the moving - cluster method to become extremely powerful with the much more accurate data expected from future astrometry projects .",
    "unfortunately , this is not really the case , as internal velocities ( both random and systematic ) become a limiting factor as soon as they are resolved by the proper - motion measurements .",
    "nevertheless , even the limited number of clusters within reach of such determinations contain a great many stars spanning a wide range in spectral type and luminosity .",
    "this project is supported by the swedish national space board and the swedish natural science research council .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "s.  sderhjelm ( lund observatory ) for providing information on double and multiple stars , prof .",
    "de zeeuw and co - workers ( leiden observatory ) for advance data on nearby ob associations , and the referee , prof .",
    "a.  blaauw , for stimulating criticism of the manuscript .",
    "in this appendix we examine how sensitive the moving - cluster method is to _ systematic _ velocity patterns in the cluster , and to what extent such patterns can be determined independently of the astrometric radial velocity . for this purpose",
    "we may ignore the random motions as well as the observational errors and we consider only a linear ( first - order ) velocity field .",
    "let @xmath186 be the position of the cluster centroid relative to the sun and @xmath187 the position of a member star relative to the centroid .",
    "the space velocity of the star is @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the peculiar velocity .",
    "the velocity field is described by the tensor @xmath190 such that @xmath191 . in cartesian",
    "coordinates the components of this tensor are simply the partial derivatives @xmath192 for @xmath193 .",
    "these nine numbers together describe the three components of a rigid - body rotation , three components of an anisotropic expansion or contraction , and three components of linear shear .",
    "it is intuitively clear that certain components of the linear velocity field , such as rotation about the line of sight , can be determined purely from the astrometric data .",
    "if the corresponding components of @xmath190 are included as parameters in the cluster model , they can be estimated and will not produce a systematic error ( bias ) in the astrometric radial velocity derived from the model fitting .",
    "such components of @xmath190 are ` observable ' and in principle not harmful to the method .",
    "let us now examine more generally the extent to which @xmath190 is observable by astrometry .",
    "suppose there exists a non - zero tensor @xmath190 such that the velocity fields @xmath194 and @xmath195 produce identical observations for some vector @xmath196 . since the cluster velocity @xmath197 is already a parameter of the model , the observational effects of the velocity field @xmath190 could then entirely be absorbed by adjusting @xmath197 . in this case",
    "@xmath190 would be a non - observable component of the general velocity field .",
    "moreover , if there exists such a component in the real velocities , then the estimated cluster velocity will have a bias equal to @xmath196 .",
    "we now need to calculate the effect of the arbitrary field @xmath190 on the observables .",
    "since the parallaxes are not affected , only the proper motion vector @xmath198 needs to be considered . in this equation @xmath199",
    "is the unit vector from the sun towards the star , @xmath200 is the rate of change of that direction , and @xmath201 is the tensor representing projection perpendicular to @xmath199 [ @xmath202 is the unit tensor ; thus @xmath203 is the tangential component of the general vector @xmath204 . with @xmath205",
    "we can write @xmath206 .",
    "@xmath190 is non - observable if the space velocities @xmath194 and @xmath207 produce identical tangential velocities for every star , i.e.  if @xmath208    = ( \\vec{i } - \\vec{r}\\vec{r}^\\prime)(\\vec{v}_0+\\delta\\vec{v})\\ ] ] for all directions @xmath199 and distances @xmath19 .",
    "this is equivalently written @xmath209 in order that this should be satisfied for all @xmath19 , it is necessary that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are separately satisfied for all unit vectors @xmath199 .",
    "the latter equation implies that @xmath212 the former equation can be written @xmath213 , which shows that @xmath199 is an eigenvector of @xmath190 ( with eigenvalue @xmath214 ) .",
    "but the only tensor for which every unit vector is an eigenvector is the isotropic tensor , @xmath215 for the arbitrary scalar @xmath168 .",
    "it follows that the only non - observable component of @xmath190 is of the form @xmath216 , parametrised by the single scalar @xmath168 , and that consequently eight linearly independent components of @xmath190 can , in principle , be determined from the astrometric observations .",
    "the non - observable field @xmath215 describes a uniform isotropic expansion ( @xmath217 ) or contraction ( @xmath218 ) of the cluster with respect to its centroid .",
    "these effects are observationally equivalent to an approach or recession of the cluster , i.e.  to a different value of its radial velocity .",
    "@xmath196 is the bias for the centroid velocity . for any given star ,",
    "the bias vector @xmath219 is the difference between the derived ( apparent ) space velocity vector @xmath220 and the true vector @xmath221 . using @xmath187 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltav ] ) we find @xmath222 the resulting bias in the astrometric radial velocity is @xmath223 isotropic expansion ( @xmath224 ) , in particular , gives the bias @xmath225 for a uniformly expanding cluster @xmath226 equals the expansion age , i.e.  the time elapsed since all the stars were confined to a very small region of space .",
