    "the recent observational data show that the universe is almost exactly flat , @xmath2 with accuracy of about 1%  @xcite .",
    "this result is in an excellent agreement with the predictions of the simplest inflationary models @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of string landscape scenario @xcite it is quite possible that our part of the universe appeared as a result of quantum tunneling , after being trapped in one of the many metastable vacua of string theory . in many cases ,",
    "tunneling can be described by a euclidean @xmath3-symmetric bounce solution called coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton  @xcite .",
    "because of the symmetry of the bounce solution , the expanding bubble has @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the bubble formed by the cdl instanton looks from the inside like an infinite open universe  @xcite .",
    "if there is no inflation after tunneling , the interior of the bubble becomes an almost empty curvature dominated universe with @xmath5 , which is ruled out by observations .",
    "however , if the universe experienced a sufficiently long stage of slow - roll inflation inside the light cone emanating from the center of the bubble , the universe almost exactly flat , with @xmath6  @xcite .    if inflation inside the bubble is too long , the universe will be absolutely flat , and hence we would be unable to tell whether our part of the universe was produced by this mechanism",
    ". therefore one could argue that it would require significant fine - tuning to produce an open universe with a minuscule but still observable deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath7 , e.g. @xmath8 . however , this conclusion is not necessarily correct .",
    "freivogel et al . argued that long stage of inflation in string theory may be improbable , so it would be natural to have @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the only reason why we do not live in such a universe is that the formation of galaxies would be disrupted by expansion of a curvature dominated open universe , just as it is disrupted by the existence of a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "this provides a possible anthropic explanation of the smallness of the parameter @xmath9 . according to @xcite , the probability of observing the deviation from flatness @xmath10 is about @xmath11 .",
    "this result was further strengthened in @xcite , where it was shown that in a certain class of the probability measures , the probability of finding a universe with @xmath12 is only about 6% .",
    "one should bear in mind that such estimates strongly depend on the choice of the probability measure , which remains an unsolved problem .",
    "however , these estimates suggest that one can obtain an explanation of the observed flatness of the universe compatible with a relatively short stage of slow - roll inflation inside an open universe . therefore , it is not very improbable that @xmath9 may be in the observable range .",
    "the goal of our paper is to study possible observational consequences of the open universe scenario with @xmath13 for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .",
    "we will focus on tensor perturbations .",
    "one should note that even though the basic idea of this scenario is pretty simple , it is not easy to find a realistic open inflation model in the single - field inflationary scenario .",
    "for example , the simplest potential which allows inflation at @xmath14 and has a metastable vacuum state at large @xmath15 can be written as a sum @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "an investigation of inflation in this scenario demonstrated that @xmath18 in the vicinity of the barrier  @xcite . in this case",
    "the tunneling occurs not through the barrier , but to the top of the barrier , described by the so - called hawking - moss instanton  @xcite .",
    "then we will have eternal inflation at the top of the barrier with @xmath19 , @xmath18 , which leads to generation of density perturbations @xmath20 on the curvature scale .",
    "therefore if the subsequent stage of the slow - roll inflation is short , we would see enormously large cmb perturbations on the horizon .",
    "this would dramatically contradict the results of the cosmological observations , unless the subsequent stage of inflation is very long , which makes the universe flat , @xmath21 .",
    "it is possible to overcome this problem and find single - field models where cdl instantons lead to tunneling and subsequent inflation . up to now ,",
    "only one explicit model of this type was proposed  @xcite , but the inflaton potential of this model is quite complicated .",
    "the scalar perturbations ignoring the self - gravity of these fluctuations in single - field models has been considered in @xcite . as for the tensor perturbations ,",
    "the studies in which the perturbation of the scalar field was neglected were done in @xcite .",
    "the general formula for the power spectrum for the single - field open inflation was given in @xcite .",
    "it is much simpler to construct models with two fields , where the stage of the slow - roll governed by one of the fields is synchronized by the tunneling of another field , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , synchronization of the tunneling in these models is only approximate .",
    "therefore the geometry of the universe inside the bubble is not exactly described by the metric of an open homogeneous universe . that is why these models were called `` quasiopen ''  @xcite .    in the simplest models of this type",
    ", the universe inside the bubble has an islandlike structure , since a sufficiently large number of e folds is possible only around the maximum of density formed by the statistical fluctuation .",
    "if we consider the simplest possibility that there is no direct interaction between the tunneling field and the inflaton field that drives inflation inside the bubble , these models are troubled with large supercurvature perturbations , especially when the energy scales before and after tunneling are significantly different . the angular power spectrum for the supercurvature perturbations is estimated as  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the hubble rate on the false vacuum side , and @xmath25 denotes the slow - roll parameter during the standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "( in the following , we often use the planck units in which @xmath26 is set to unity . )",
    "this amplitude of fluctuation has steep @xmath27 dependence and is much larger than the ordinary slow - roll power spectrum determined by the hubble rate during the open inflation unless @xmath28 is extremely small .",
    "therefore we need to introduce some complications even in two field models , in order to make them compatible with observations  @xcite .",
    "originally , the models of open inflation were proposed in order to describe an inflationary universe with @xmath29 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath29 was eventually ruled out from the cmb observations , but cmb observations do not rule out the possibility that inflation after tunneling is sufficiently long and @xmath0 is sufficiently close to @xmath7 .",
    "this fact gives a revived interest in the generation of perturbation in these models from the point of view of testing some of the predictions of the string landscape scenario .",
    "indeed , we will find that some models based on cdl tunneling are consistent with the existing observational data for @xmath30 , but may be ruled out for @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , models of quasiopen inflation , as well as the models leading to the hawking - moss tunneling  @xcite , may lead to very specific predictions , which may allow us to test basic principles of the string inflation scenario and to study observational consequences of the decay of the metastable string theory vacua .",
    "the general requirement to this class of model is that @xmath28 must be extremely small , which means that inflation after the tunneling must be very long .",
    "the models to be studied in this paper will be quite generic , but we will keep in mind some of the expected features of tunneling in the landscape and the last stage of the slow - roll inflation . in particular , a typical vacuum energy in the landscape can approach planck density or density close to the scale of the grand unification , even though of course there are many vacua with much smaller energy density .",
    "meanwhile , in many models of slow - roll inflation based on the kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi scenario of stabilization of stringy vacua  @xcite , the maximal hubble constant at the last stage of the slow - roll inflation can not be greater than the gravitino mass @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the typical vacuum energy of the decaying metastable vacuum in the open universe scenario is many orders of magnitude greater than the energy density during the last stage of the slow - roll inflation .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the investigation of the models with the cdl tunneling and investigate the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "we will focus on tensor perturbations since tensor perturbations are more sensitive to the value of the hubble parameter and properties of tunneling than scalar perturbations . at the end of the paper we will briefly discuss scalar perturbations and their cosmological implications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the background evolution of the models of open inflation in the context of the string landscape scenario .",
    "there we introduce models with a rapid - roll phase after the bubble nucleation . in sec .",
    "iii we first review the method to evaluate the tensor perturbation after the false vacuum decay , and apply it to our models to identify the typical signature in the cmb spectrum .",

    "the background geometry and the field configuration in the lorentzian regime are obtained by the analytic continuation of the bounce solution .",
    "it is convenience to use the coordinate @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 .",
    "the coordinates in the lorentzian regime are given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath43 the penrose diagram for this open friedmann - robertson - walker universe is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : open_conformal_chart ] .        typically , cdl instantons exist only if @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "this condition , in combination with the requirement of the subsequent long stage of the slow - roll inflation , requires a very special choice of potentials in the single - field models  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may consider multifield models  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the single - field models and assume that the cdl instanton exists .",
    "meanwhile , inflation typically requires @xmath45 .",
    "it is difficult to make these two conditions compatible .",
    "therefore one may expect that the slow - roll inflation does not start immediately after the cdl tunneling , and there must be some intermediate stage of rapid rolling down  @xcite .",
    "this intermediate regime may last for a long time if the field potential is steep after tunneling . in general",
    ", this may be a typical situation during the tunneling in the string landscape scenario .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the tunneling in the landscape may occur from a metastable vacuum with a very high value of energy density . unless we have some specific knowledge about this vacuum state",
    ", one may assume that the scale of the energy density of this vacuum may be @xmath20 in planck units , or it may take some value on the grand unification energy scale @xmath46 . meanwhile in many models of the slow - roll inflation based on string theory with vacuum stabilization , the hubble constant must be smaller than the gravitino mass  @xcite . although it is possible to avoid this conclusion , it is very hard to do it without fine - tuning .",
    "if the gravitino mass is of the order @xmath7 tev or lower , the corresponding vacuum energy density during the last stage of the slow - roll inflation should be smaller than @xmath47 , in planck units .",
    "our knowledge of the string landscape is very incomplete , so one should not fully rely on the estimates given above .",
    "however , on the basis of our present understanding of the situation , one should not be surprised to have a very long - lasting noninflationary stage after tunneling , which should last until the large energy density of the metastable vacuum state is reduced by many orders of magnitude and the slow - roll inflation begins .",
    "we will show that the behavior in the phase of the rapid rolling down significantly affects the cmb power spectrum . in the next subsection",
    ", we will investigate the field evolution inside the open universe in the region r in fig .",
    "[ fig : open_conformal_chart ] .      in order to study the field dynamics inside the light cone emanating from the center of the bubble ( region r ) , it is useful to use the following identity : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "as seen from the figure , the spectra are quite different from the plain spectrum , for which we neglect not only the contribution of the wall fluctuation mode but also the effect of the field dynamics in the region r. the power spectrum for @xmath78 increases sharply for small @xmath174 , i.e. highly red - tilted . as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : evol ] , in this case the curvature length is well outside the horizon size during the tracking phase .",
    "since the amplitude for small @xmath174 depends on the value of the hubble rate at the time when the curvature scale starts to deviate from the horizon size , it keeps the memory of the high expansion rate of @xmath193 at the onset of the rapid - roll phase .",
    "therefore the squared amplitude for small @xmath174 is proportional to @xmath194 .",
    "in contrast , the wavelength of the modes with sufficiently large @xmath174 stays inside the horizon size during the tracking phase . only after the field arrives at the slow - roll plateau do these modes cross the horizon .",
    "thus , the squared amplitude of the modes with large @xmath174 becomes @xmath195 .",
    "for this reason , the spectrum for @xmath78 is steeply red - tilted .    by contrast , if the potential is extremely steep , @xmath196 , at the nucleation point , the field starts to roll down rapidly before the curvature term becomes irrelevant for the expansion of the universe .",
    "as long as the potential continues to be steep enough , the curvature length stays comparable to the horizon size . if this remains the case until the field reaches the slow - roll plateau , even the amplitude of the modes with @xmath197 is governed by the hubble rate at the slow - roll plateau , @xmath72 .",
    "therefore there is no significant enhancement of the amplitude for small @xmath174 in this case .",
    "finally , the spectrum for @xmath64 can be understood in the usual manner .",
    "the spectrum is similar to the one presented in fig .",

    "is increased , the magnitude for large @xmath174 decreases because it is normalized by the hubble parameter at the nucleation point @xmath187 , which becomes larger .",
    "we translate the spectrum for tensor - type perturbation obtained in the preceding subsection into cmb temperature anisotropies , following the discussion given in ref .",
    "the large - angle cmb temperature anisotropies due to tensor - type perturbation are simply evaluated by the sachs - wolfe formula @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively , denote the conformal time at the present epoch and that at the last scattering surface , @xmath201 is the unit vector along the observer s line of sight and @xmath202 represents the photon trajectory .",
    "since we are interested in the anisotropies on large angular scales , we consider only those modes that enter the hubble horizon after the universe becomes matter dominated .",
    "thus , we set the scale factor to @xmath203 .",
    "the conformal time then can be written in terms of the density parameter @xmath204 and the redshift @xmath205 : @xmath206 where we have neglected the effect of the dark energy .",

    "the value of @xmath0 depends rather sensitively on the underlying scenario .",
    "the prediction for the value of @xmath0 , based on the primordial distribution of the number of the e folds of the inflation inside the bubble and the anthropic bias , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "there is a big uncertainty because the resulting distribution of the value of @xmath0 strongly depends on the choice of the probability measure , but their estimates imply that it can be natural that @xmath9 is in the marginally observable range .",
    "for this reason , we focus on the case that @xmath9 is in the observable range , e.g. from @xmath221 to @xmath222 , and evaluate the cmb anisotropies for the previously introduced two toy models .",
    "the computed cmb temperature power spectra for the exponential - type and chaotic - type models are shown in figs .",

    "again we set @xmath190 and @xmath191 as a representative case in which the contribution from the wall fluctuation mode is negligibly small .",
    "one can see that the tensor cmb angular power spectrum for small @xmath27 behaves like @xmath223 , while it agrees with the scale invariant inflationary tensor spectrum for large @xmath27 .",
    "compared with the amplitude of the tensor perturbation for the slow - roll inflation at @xmath224 , there is significant enhancement for small @xmath27 due to the field dynamics in the region r for @xmath225 .",
    "hence , we find that , unless @xmath63 is not extremely large , rapid rolling down affects the cmb spectrum at low @xmath27 significantly .",
    "it is known that the spectrum eq .",

    "when the deviation of @xmath0 from unity is small , it will be useful to expand quantities with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum due to the wall fluctuations given by eq .   reduces to @xmath230 unless @xmath9 is close to unity , the effects of wall fluctuation mode mainly appear in the quadrupole of cmb temperature fluctuation .",
    "the amplitude of the wall fluctuation mode can be also evaluated analytically . as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : consthubble ] , [ fig : hybrid_spectrum ] , and [ fig : chaotic_spectrum ] , the integral ( [ pw ] ) is dominated by the contribution from @xmath174 around 0 .",

    "notice that @xmath236 also depends on the field dynamics in the region r through @xmath237 , which can be large .",
    "substituting eq .   into eq .  , we find that the amplitude due to wall fluctuations can be approximated by @xmath238 with @xmath239 this expression ( [ eq : amp wall ] ) is valid even if @xmath240 is large .",
    "the expression contains exponential but , in fact , @xmath241 is just @xmath242 for @xmath243 , while @xmath244 for @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , @xmath246 only weekly depends on @xmath247 .",
    "roughly speaking , the above expression indicates that the amplitude of the wall fluctuations can be significantly enhanced only when @xmath248 is large .",
    "small @xmath145 can be realized for a small wall tension @xmath249 since @xmath145 is roughly estimated as @xmath250 when @xmath24 and @xmath187 are the same order .",
    "an interesting observation is that the amplitude of wall fluctuation also depends on @xmath251 .",
    "therefore , when the continuum contribution @xmath229 for small @xmath27 is enhanced due to the evolution inside the region r , the wall fluctuation mode is also enhanced .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newfig ] how the amplitude of @xmath252 depends on @xmath63 for the case of the exponential - type model defined by eq .  .",

    "the magnitude becomes larger for a smaller value of @xmath145 .",
    "it may be noted that both modes at @xmath256 and at @xmath257 contribute to the cmb quadrupole , but the former modes physically represent the wall fluctuation degree of freedom .",

    ", width=302 ]    if a model predicts large enhancement of low @xmath27 modes due to tensor perturbation , such a model may contradict the current observation .",
    "this gives a constraint on the model building based on string theory .",
    "we are interested in the case when @xmath187 is close to planck scale but inflation in the region r occurs at sufficiently low energies .",
    "we also require @xmath28 is not extremely small . as advocated by freivogel et al .",
    "@xcite , this may be achieved naturally in the string landscape .",
    "then , first of all , a very small @xmath268 is not compatible with the above scenario because the slow - roll inflation phase starts before the energy density decays sufficiently .",
    "this means that the amplitude of the tensor perturbation is too large .",
    "when @xmath269 , the contribution to the cmb spectrum from the tensor perturbation is largely suppressed by the factor @xmath270 .",
    "even if @xmath271 , there is a suppression factor @xmath272 .",
    "on the other hand , there is a possible huge enhancement factor @xmath273 due to the wall fluctuation mode , which can be very large if the wall tension is small .",
    "however , one can not choose a very small @xmath145 in the present context when @xmath187 is close to the planck scale .",
    "an extremely small @xmath145 is in conflict with the requirement that the bubble nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed in order to avoid too large a signature of bubble collisions in our observable universe .",
    "the above three factors , the values of @xmath268 , @xmath145 and @xmath28 basically control the amplitude of the cmb spectrum for small @xmath27 due to the tensor perturbation , which is observationally constrained to be not too large . we should stress that the constraint from the tensor contribution can be avoided if one can arrange the potential slope after the bubble nucleation to be sufficiently steep , i.e. , if @xmath274 .    in this paper , we did not study how the factor coming from the tunneling process , which is @xmath253 in the thin - wall case , is related to the tunneling potential beyond the thin - wall approximation .",
    "for example , we did not discuss the case that the energy density at the nucleation point is already largely reduced , in spite of the high false vacuum energy .",
    "such a tunneling process can not be described by the thin - wall approximation .",
    "we will come back to this issue in our future publication .",
    "the inflation scenario with cdl tunneling , the so - called open inflation has attracted renewed attention in the context of string landscape .",
    "the most important cosmological consequence in the string landscape is that it is likely that there were a sequence of tunneling events in our past and our universe is produced inside a bubble .    in this paper we focused on those models that experience the cdl tunneling followed by the last inflation before the beginning of our hot friedmann universe inside a nucleated bubble .",
    "our interest was in the landscape scenario in which the energy density at the nucleation point is close to the planck scale , while a much lower energy scale is preferred for this last inflation inside the nucleated bubble .",
    "we also assumed a moderately small @xmath28 preferred from a perspective of the anthropic probability distribution . under these assumptions we examined the cmb temperature anisotropies due to the tensor - type perturbation .",
    "we considered single - field models , assuming that the condition for the presence of a cdl instanton @xmath44 is satisfied around the potential barrier . in this case",
    "it seems difficult to imagine that such a potential is connected to the one that satisfies one of the slow - roll conditions @xmath275 immediately after tunneling .",
    "therefore it seems fairly natural to have some intermediate stage of rapid rolling down after tunneling .",
    "we found that a rapid - roll phase significantly modifies the power spectrum of the tensor - type perturbations .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the power spectrum strongly depends on the slow - roll parameter at the nucleation point , @xmath62 , where @xmath276 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ slow - roll0 ] ) .    when @xmath225 , there is no rapid - roll phase .",
    "then , the high rate of cosmic expansion near the nucleation point is imprinted in the low @xmath27 components of cmb and the spectrum becomes red - tilted .",
    "such a feature would contradict the observed cmb spectrum if the potential energy at the nucleation point were sufficiently high and @xmath28 were not extremely small .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , if the transition were driven by the hawking - moss instanton , which is the case in the inflationary models with the simplest polynomial potential @xmath16 , the large - angle cmb fluctuations would be significantly enhanced due to the scalar - type perturbations .",
    "such models would contradict current observations , unless the last stage of inflation after the tunneling is very long .",
    "a similar conclusion is valid for the quasiopen scenario , which involves more than one scalar field @xcite .",
    "this scenario seems much easier , if not easiest , to implement in string theory , as compared to other options .",
    "thus one of the important conclusions is that we are already testing string theory landscape against observations , and we already know quite a lot about the structure of the potential , assuming that inflation after tunneling is rather short .",
    "note that this assumption  @xcite is based on a specific choice of the probability measure in eternal inflation , and on some additional assumptions about the inflationary potentials in the landscape .",
    "our analysis shows that either we can rule out a large class of inflationary potentials which at the first glance seem quite reasonable or we can rule out the assumption that a long stage of the slow - roll inflation is improbable .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath79 , we have a rapid - roll phase after the bubble nucleation . in this case",
    ", the cmb spectrum behaves as if there is no memory of the high energy regime .",
    "namely , the magnitude of cmb spectrum is basically determined by the slow - roll inflation at low energies , which succeeds the rapid - roll phase .",
    "therefore the tensor perturbations tend to be negligible , which is consistent with observations .",
    "we also note that the scalar - type perturbations are expected to be more sensitive to the evolution of the field .",
    "since the power spectrum for gauge - invariant spatial curvature perturbation will be roughly given by @xmath277 , one can expect that the amplitude of the scalar perturbations will be suppressed during the rapid - roll phase .",
    "since this effect occurs at the first stages of inflation after the tunneling , it may lead to suppression of the large scale adiabatic perturbations  @xcite this tendency seems to fit well with the observed suppression of the cmb quadrupole moment  @xcite .    the above conclusion is slightly modified by the presence of the wall fluctuation modes .",
    "when the wall tension @xmath249 is much smaller than @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the energy density at around the tunneling , the wall fluctuation modes enhance the low @xmath27 components in the cmb spectrum in proportion to @xmath280 .",
    "therefore a possible observational signature of the wall fluctuation modes is basically in the cmb quadrupole .",
    "the amplitude due to the wall fluctuation modes is also influenced by the value of @xmath268 in the same manner as that due to the continuous modes .",
    "in particular , the contribution of the wall fluctuation modes is negligible for @xmath274 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newfig ] .    to summarize , in the context of the string theory landscape",
    ", the current observational data already constrain the shape of the potential such that the slow - roll parameter @xmath281 right after tunneling should be large , @xmath274 unless @xmath28 is extremely small .",
    "a large value of @xmath268 also reduces the contribution of the wall fluctuation modes to the cmb spectrum , and hence seems to be even preferred from the observed suppression of the cmb quadrupole .    in this paper , we focused on tensor - type perturbations .",
    "we found that the effect of the evolution of the inflaton inside a nucleated bubble affects the tensor - type power spectrum significantly .",
    "we also discussed expected signatures in the scalar - type perturbations based on previous work in the literature . using these expected features in the cmb spectra , we can say that we are already testing models of inflation in the context of string theory landscape . to make more definite predictions and test the landscape , detailed studies on the scalar - type perturbations are necessary .",

    "<S> the open inflation scenario is attracting a renewed interest in the context of the string landscape . since there are a large number of metastable de sitter vacua in the string landscape , tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through the bubble nucleation occur quite naturally , which leads to a natural realization of open inflation . </S>",
    "<S> although the deviation of @xmath0 from unity is small by the observational bound , we argue that the effect of this small deviation on the large - angle cmb anisotropies can be significant for tensor - type perturbation in the open inflation scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the situation in which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum tunneling and that of the slow - roll inflation in the nucleated bubble . </S>",
    "<S> if the potential just after tunneling is steep enough , a rapid - roll phase appears before the slow - roll inflation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum is basically determined by the hubble rate during the slow - roll inflation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if such a rapid - roll phase is absent , the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high energy density there in the large angular components . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the amplitude of large angular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation mode if the bubble wall tension is small . therefore , although even the dominant quadrupole component is suppressed by the factor @xmath1 , one can construct some models in which the deviation of @xmath0 from unity is large enough to produce measurable effects . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a more general class of models , where the false vacuum decay may occur due to hawking - moss tunneling , as well as the models involving more than one scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss scalar perturbations in these models and point out that a large set of such models is already ruled out by observational data , unless there was a very long stage of slow - roll inflation after the tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that observational data allow us to test various assumptions concerning the structure of the string theory potentials and the duration of the last stage of inflation . </S>"
