    "for the study we used brightest 85 clusters observed with _ asca _ whose redshifts distribute from 0.004 to 0.201 with a median of 0.046 . from each gis and sis instrument ,",
    "a spectrum over a central region of @xmath2 radius and one outside @xmath2 radius were accumulated .",
    "we fitted each set of _ asca _ spectra with the two - temperature model ( 2 t model ) , in which a hot component is filling entire cluster region , while in the central region a cool component is allowed to coexist with the hot component forming two - phase plasma .",
    "we then obtained x - ray luminosity in 0.1 - 2.4  kev band and temperature of cool and hot component , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "full results are given in ikebe et al .",
    "an example of the 2 t model fit is shown in fig .  1 for abell  1795 , which has one of the brightest central cool component .",
    "the validity of the 2 t model was tested with the latest x - ray data of abell  1795 taken with xmm - newton .",
    "the 11 annular spectra of epic - pn were simultaneously fitted with the 2 t model , where each annular spectrum is modeled with sum of two isothermal component , and each component is assumed to have common temperature throughout all radii .",
    "the fit is good and the best - fit two temperatures are derived to be @xmath4=3.3  kev and @xmath6=6.4  kev , which are compared with the temperature profile obtained with the single - phase model ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath6 nicely agree with the central coolest temperature and that of the isothermal component in the outer region , respectively .",
    "therefore , the 2 t modeling is valid to the most advanced x - ray data and usable to characterize the property of the central cool component and the surrounding icm .",
    "based on the results from the 2 t model fitting to the _ asca _ data of the 85 selected clusters , we investigated various correlations . in the study , we classified the cluster sample into three groups , which are strong cool component ( scc ) , x - ray dominant ( xd ) and non - x - ray dominant ( nxd ) .",
    "an scc cluster is defined as one showing a very strong ( statistically very significant ) cool component in the _ asca _ spectrum . among the rest of the clusters , one in which the x - ray peak coincides with the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg )",
    "is classified as an xd cluster , while nxd is defined as one without such a galaxy .",
    "all the scc clusters turned out to be xds , too .    for the scc clusters",
    ", we determined the temperatures and emission measures of each cool and hot component .",
    "figure  3(a ) shows the cool component luminosity as a function of the cool component temperature for the scc clusters . a positive correlation is clearly seen .",
    "figure  4 shows the correlation between the two temperatures of the hot and cool component for the scc clusters .",
    "surprisingly , the ratios between the two temperatures , @xmath7 , is virtually constant and the relation , @xmath4=@xmath8 well represents the correlation .    for clusters that do not show very strong cool component , i.e. non - scc clusters , we fixed @xmath4 at the half value of each mean temperature derived with a single - temperature model fitting , according to the @xmath4=@xmath8 relation .",
    "the luminosity of the cool component thus estimated for the non - scc clusters is illustrated in fig .",
    "the results of the scc clusters are also overlayed .",
    "scc and xd clusters exhibit systematically more luminous cool component than nxd clusters .",
    "actually , many of nxd clusters give only upper limit to @xmath3 .",
    "we obtained the @xmath9 relation of the hot component , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "unlike for the cool component , the three classes do not show any systematic difference .",
    "it is then clearly shown that the x - ray characteristics of the xd and nxd clusters are segregated mainly by the central cool component . to compare with the @xmath9 relation of the cool component",
    "would be very interesting . in the fig .",
    "5(b ) , the @xmath3@xmath4 relation for the scc clusters shown in fig .  3",
    "is overlayed on the @xmath5@xmath6 relation .",
    "a surprising agreement is clearly seen . the best fit power - law function to the @xmath5@xmath6 relation",
    "is compared with the scc @xmath3@xmath4 relation in fig .",
    "the similarity of the two @xmath0@xmath1 relation suggests that both the cool and hot components are related to individual gravitational bound objects .",
    "therefore , the cool component can be naturally interpreted as icm filling a self - gravitating system whose size is comparable to a giant elliptical galaxy or a group of galaxies , which is immersed in the host cluster ."
