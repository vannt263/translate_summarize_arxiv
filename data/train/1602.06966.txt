    "scalar - tensor theories have attracted the attention of cosmologists since a seminal work by jordan was published in the fifties @xcite .",
    "however , the great impetus to investigate these kinds of theories came from brans - dicke theory , which is considered by many as the most popular and simplest alternative theory of gravity @xcite . in the last three decades ,",
    "interest in scalar - tensor theory has increased , mainly motivated by modern kaluza - klein theory , string theory , inflationary models , and other recent proposals . as is well known",
    ", scalar - tensor theories in general do not assign an intrinsic geometric character to the scalar field . nor does this field describe matter in the usual sense . in the particular case of brans - dicke theory ,",
    "its role is to account for possible variations of newton s gravitational _ constant _ , since the latter , according to mach ideas , would depend on the mass of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , there have been some attempts to construct a scalar - tensor theory of gravitation in which the scalar field is an essential part of the space - time geometry @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "one looks for a geometrical framework that contains a scalar field as a way of adding a new degree of freedom to the corresponding gravity theory .    in the present article",
    ", we consider a scalar - tensor theory of gravity , in which the scalar field does play a geometric role .",
    "the mechanism for inserting the scalar field in the space - time geometry is inspired by weyl s generalization of riemannian geometry , in the very special case when the gauge field corresponds to an exact 1-form @xcite .",
    "the space - time structure that results from this kind of geometry is known in the literature as a weyl integrable space - time ( wist ) @xcite .",
    "the first approach to a scalar - tensor theory set in a wist was proposed by novello et al , and consists of a direct extension of general relativity by including in the einstein - hilbert action a term corresponding to a massless scalar field , the latter being interpreted as a geometrical field in the sense of weyl geometry @xcite .",
    "a more recent geometrical approach to scalar - tensor theory ( gst ) starts by considering the action of brans - dicke theory and introduces the space - time geometry from first principles , that is , by applying the palatini formalism , which then leads to a weyl integrable geometry @xcite .",
    "although the original version of gst theory does not include a scalar potential in the action , the inclusion of such term is rather natural and does not alter the geometrical aspects of the theory .",
    "thus , in this paper we consider a slightly modified version of original proposal by adding a scalar potential .",
    "certainly , the main motivation for this modification lies in the fact that in modern cosmology scalar potentials are an important ingredient of inflationary models , quintessence , and other theories .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of the geometrical scalar - tensor theory and consider its extension to include a scalar potential . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the application of the geometric scalar - tensor theory to some cosmological scenarios , in which matter can be neglected as the potential energy of the scalar field is the dominant contribution . in section 4 ,",
    "we construct a very simple cosmological model , a sort of toy model , in which a phase of accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by pure geometry .",
    "we conclude in section v with some remarks .",
    "the weyl geometrical scalar - tensor theory starts with the action given by @xmath0   -v(\\phi)\\right\\ }   + s_{m}(g,\\psi ) , \\label{action1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a scalar field , @xmath3 is a function of @xmath2 , @xmath4 represents the scalar field potential , and @xmath5 indicates the part of the action depending on the matter fields , here generically denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "let us recall that @xmath2 is regarded as a purely geometrical field , whose meaning becomes clear only after a palatini variation of the action above is carried out .",
    "indeed , it is known that the variation of ( [ action1 ] ) with respect to the affine connection @xmath7 leads to @xcite @xmath8 an equation that expresses the so - called weyl compatibility condition between the metric and the connection ( also called weyl nonmetricity condition ) appears in the expression @xmath9 it denotes @xmath10 otherwise @xmath11 denotes the metric tensor .",
    "we shall also consider the ricci tensor @xmath12  as being given in terms of the affine connection coefficients @xmath7 via the definition of the curvature tensor . ] .",
    "this is the geometric condition that characterizes the space - time manifold as a weyl integrable space - time @xcite . by performing the palatini variation with respect to the metric @xmath13 and the scalar field @xmath2 we obtain the following set of field equations : @xmath14 @xmath15 where the symbol @xmath16 denotes the dalembertian operator calculated with respect to the weyl connection , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 represents the weyl invariant energy - momentum tensor of the matter fields as defined in @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the weyl condition ( [ nonmetricity ] ) does not change when we perform the following transformations in @xmath11 and @xmath2:@xmath19@xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary scalar function defined on the manifold space - time @xmath22 .",
    "these  transformations are known , in the literature , as weyl transformations .",

    "typical gravitational problems , such as the field generated by a spherically symmetric matter distribution , or the existence of naked singularities and wormholes as geometric phenomena , have already been studied in the context of weyl geometrical scalar - tensor theory @xcite . in this work",
    ", we would like to consider some cosmological models arising from different choices of the scalar potential . for convenience",
    ", we shall work in the riemann frame , although due to frame invariance all physical results obtained will be valid in any weyl frame @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the technique of frame transformations to investigate cosmological models with non - minimally coupled scalar fields is not new , and has been used recently @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , scalar fields have been extensively used in cosmology , mainly motivated by inflationary models , but also as a possible way to account for dark matter and quintessence models of dark energy @xcite . in inflationary cosmology , the scalar field ( _ the inflaton _ ) is responsible for the negative pressure needed to expand the universe @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , up to now the nature of this scalar field is not known . on the other hand , since the apperance of inflationary cosmology in the 1980 s different models have been proposed , in which the presence of a scalar potential @xmath4 is considered @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these requires a monomial potential . despite the fact that the latest observational results do not favour a potential of the type @xmath34 @xcite ,",
    "a massive scalar field has been considered by many authors with great interest @xcite . in the following sections",
    ", we shall consider some simple models for different types of @xmath4 in the context of the weyl geometrical scalar - tensor theory . in almost cases",
    "we shall add the cosmological constant @xmath35 . throughout our discussion",
    ", we shall always take the point of view that the scalar field has an essentially geometric origin .",
    "this is because it is always possible to interpret the scalar field as a geometric field by going to the weyl frame @xcite .",
    "let us now start by considering a homogeneous , spatially flat , and isotropic model , whose line element is written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the scale factor .",
    "let us also restrict ourselves to the vacuum case and , as in brans - dicke theory , let us for simplicity set @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the field equations ( [ poster09 ] ) reduce to @xmath39@xmath40 while ( [ poster10 ] ) gives @xmath41 expressing the above equations in terms of the expansion parameter @xmath42 , and defining @xmath43 , it is easy to verify , after simple calculations , that we are left with the following equations : is frame - invariant , then the expansion parameter @xmath44 is also invariant . indeed , by definition @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the 4-velocity field of the fundamental observers .",

    "these are , in fact , the simplest of all solutions of the above field equations .",
    "the solution @xmath56 corresponds to the well - known de sitter ( anti - de sitter ) universe , a maximally symmetric vacuum solution of einstein s field equations with a cosmological constant .    for @xmath57 and @xmath53",

    "if @xmath60 and @xmath61 the solutions are @xmath62@xmath63 in this case , we have a model that describes a cyclic universe , which undergoes an eternal series of oscillations , each beginning with a big bang and ending with a big crunch , and in each cycle a period of expansion is followed by a contraction .",
    "let us just remark here that cyclic universes have been favoured by many recent proposals @xcite .",
    "in particular , cyclic models have also been predicted by loop quantum cosmology through a mechanism by which the contracting and expanding cosmological branches are connected by a quantum bridge  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "if both @xmath35 and @xmath3 are positive , the solutions will be given by @xmath64@xmath65 these solutions are singular at @xmath66 and describe an expanding and accelerating universe which tends to a de sitter universe when @xmath67    a nice picture of the time evolution of the above models is given by the phase portraits of the dynamical system corresponding to the field equations , since these portraits may provide an insight on the dynamical behaviour of the solutions . in the next section , we shall give a qualitative analysis of the solutions obtained .",
    "in this case , it is easy to verify that the field equations ( [ poster12])-([poster13 ] ) and ( [ poster14 ] ) reduce to @xmath68@xmath69@xmath70 as we can see , the above equations constitute an autonomous planar dynamical system , with ( [ poster15 ] ) representing an algebraic constraint in the phase space @xcite .    in order to draw the phase portrait ,",
    "let us first determine the critical ( or equilibrium ) points of the system , that is , the points in the phase plane at which the right side of ( [ poster16 ] ) and ( [ poster17 ] ) vanishes .",
    "there are four equilibrium points , but only two of them satisfy the constraint equation ( [ poster15 ] ) , and these correspond to special solutions , presenting the simplest kind of behaviour .",
    "it is not difficult to see that we have equilibrium points only if @xmath53 . and @xmath35 are both negative is not allowed because of ( [ poster15 ] ) . ]",
    "these are @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath74 , which lie on the axis @xmath75 and correspond , respectively , to the solutions ( [ cosmological_const01 ] ) , i.e. , the de sitter and anti - de sitter solutions found in the previous section .  the solutions for @xmath57 and @xmath53 , obtained above , lie in the ellipse ( depicted in bold ) , which is the only curve in the phase plane satisfying the constraint ( [ poster15 ] ) ( see * fig . 1a * ) .",
    "the solutions given by the equations ( [ cosmological_const02 ] ) and ( [ cosmological_const03 ] ) are represented in the diagram as the trajectories starting at @xmath73 and ending at @xmath71 , in the anticlockwise @xmath76 and clockwise sense @xmath77 ,  respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the solution corresponding to the point @xmath71 is stable with respect to small perturbations in the phase plane , while @xmath73 has a unstable character .",
    "the existence of this kind of stability ( instability ) pattern associated to the two critical points seems to lead to an interesting behaviour as far as the space - time geometry of these models is concerned .",
    "consider , for instance , the solution represented by the equilibrium point @xmath73 , which , as we know , corresponds to a contracting de sitter space - time , with a constant scalar field .",
    "from the point of view of the weyl frame @xmath23 , this means that the space - time geometry is riemannian .",
    "now , let us look at how the space - time geometry evolves when this universe is slightly perturbed .",
    "clearly , the time evolution is either determined by @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "initially , when @xmath80 , these universes are in an purely riemannian regime as the scalar field is nearly constant .",
    "this situation will change as soon as the scalar field ceases to be a constant and gradually starts to depend on time .",
    "then  the universe enters a new regime , in which space - time is characterized by a weyl integrable geometry .",
    "one is tempted to say that we have here a kind of geometrical phase transition , since we go from a purely riemannian geometry to a weyl integrable geometry .",
    "finally , as @xmath81 , since @xmath78 and @xmath79  both approach the equilibrium point @xmath71 , the universe returns to its initial riemannian regime , undergoing another geometrical transition , this time from a weyl geometry to a purely riemannian de sitter space - time , represented in the phase portrait by the equilibrium point @xmath71 .    the phase diagram corresponding to the solutions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , namely , ( [ cosmological_const04 ] ) and ( [ cosmological_const05 ] ) , are depicted as bold lines in * fig .",
    "1b*. as the diagram clearly shows , we have two singular  universes which start with a big bang , undergo an era of expansion , and finally collapse to a big crunch . interpreting this picture in the weyl frame",
    ", we see that because the time derivative of the scalar field does not vanish no geometrical phase transition takes place in this case .    finally ,",
    "when both @xmath3 and @xmath35 are positive , the phase portrait of the solutions is shown in * fig .",
    "1c*. in this case , as regards the solutions given by equations ( [ cosmological_const06 ] ) and ( [ cosmological_const07 ] ) , the critical point @xmath71 behaves as an attractor , while @xmath73 acts as a repellor . in the first situation",
    ", we have singular expanding weyl space - times evolving towards a riemannian de sitter universe , while in the second , small perturbations cause a riemannian anti - de sitter universe start to collapsing into a big crunch .    to conclude this section , let us , just for the sake of completeness , examine the degenerate case when @xmath82 . in this case , the equations ( [ poster12 ] ) , ( [ poster13 ] ) and ( [ poster14 ] )  become @xmath83@xmath84@xmath85    we first note that in order to obtain real solutions we  must restrict the parameter @xmath3 to be positive .",

    "] we also note that the conics that appeared in the former phase diagrams , representing the constraint of the dynamical system , now simply degenerate into the pair of straight lines @xmath86 ( see * fig . 1d * ) .",

    "we see that when @xmath175 , @xmath2 tends asymptotically to @xmath176 .",
    "if we recall the geometrical meaning of the scalar field , we may interpret the behaviour of the ( kinklike ) solution @xmath177 as clearly indicating the presence of two geometric phase transitions . indeed , as we clearly see from * fig .",
    "5c * , the universe comes asymptotically from a riemannian regime as @xmath80 , undergoes a sudden expansion , and then goes back smoothly ( when @xmath178 ) to a riemannian space - time .",
    "although these transitions are essentially continuous , we see that there is brief period of time when the change in the space - time geometry is more drastic .",
    "this coincides with the period when the expansion rate of the universe starts to grow in a really significant way , taking much larger values than in the past until it approaches a stage of exponential expansion .",
    "clearly , the whole expansion process is driven by the geometric scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , in this picture it is the dynamics of the scalar field  that links the quasi - static regime @xmath179 to an expanding universe assymptotically approaching a de sitter regime ( @xmath180 constant ) . on the other hand , since in this model",
    "the de sitter - like expansion phase of the universe lasts forever .",
    "of course the above discussion is merely qualitative .",
    "our aim in this work is just to call the attention of cosmologists to new theoretical possibilities , in which we can view the scalar field as possessing a pure geometric character , being , in fact , part of the fundamental space - time structure . finally , according to this toy model",
    ", the universe is eternally existing , and thus does not require a beginning or an ultimate end , and that means we have here a simple example of an interesting dynamical cosmological scenario with no singularity @xcite .    to conclude , it is interesting to note that if we drop the above condition @xmath174 , we can , by appropriately choosing the constants @xmath113 , @xmath130 and @xmath166 , obtain a class of the so - called bounce models . as is well known , the general idea underlying the bounce cosmology is that the hot big bang scenario , as it is understood today , simply describes a period of expansion of the universe that followed a previous contraction .",
    "in fact , a great deal of research has recently gone into the study of these models @xcite .",
    "we therefore thought it would be interesting to briefly mention that a bouncing universe scenario may also emerge from a simple geometric model as the one presented in this section .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to verify that for @xmath181 the very same scalar potential @xmath4 , given by ( [ eq04 ] ) , leading to the equation ( [ eq.08 ] ) allows for a non - singular bouncing universe whose behaviour is displayed in the figures below .",
    "the recent discovery of the higgs particle has clearly shown that scalar fields play a fundamental role in the theory of subatomic physics . on the other hand , as we have already remarked , a closer look at modern theoretical cosmology reveals that scalar fields also have played an increasing important role in the description of our universe . in particular , inflationary universes and quintessence models for dark energy , respectively , resort to scalar fields for explaining early expansion and cosmic acceleration .",
    "however , the nature of the scalar field is still not known .",
    "it appears to us that a geometrical scalar - tensor theory may provide a natural framework for investigating some cosmological scenarios in which the scalar field is taken into account as an essential ingredient for our description of the universe . with this motivation ,",
    "we have briefly examined some cosmological models generated by different choices of the scalar field potential proposed in the literature .",
    "in addition to obtaining some analytical solutions , we have constructed the phase portrait of the solutions . in some cases we have found a cosmological scenario which might be viewed as qualitatively describing a kind of geometric phase transition of the universe .",
    "the geometrical origin of the scalar field , which is one of the basic tenets of the wist s theoretical framework , appears as a consequence of the application of the palatini variational principle to the gravitational sector of the action ( [ action1 ] ) , the same powerful principle that , when applied to einstein - hilbert action , leads directly to the riemannian nature of the space - time structure @xcite .",
    "the applications of the weyl geometrical scalar - tensor theories to cosmology naturally consider cosmological scenarios where the presence of a scalar field is required .",
    "in most models ( inflation , dark energy , quintessence , etc ) the real nature of the scalar field is not known yet , and it is reasonably guessed that this kind of phenomenological approach can be justified later . however , in the case of weyl geometrical scalar - tensor theory the nature of the scalar field is already known from the beginning : it is part of the geometric framework of space - time . in our view",
    ", this emphasis on the geometrical role of the scalar field seems to be more in line with the program of geometrization of physics put forward by einstein when he conceived the general theory of relativity .",
