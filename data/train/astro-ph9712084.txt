    "the class of compact steep - spectrum sources ( csss ) has been discussed by many authors ( e.g.  pearson et al .",
    "1985 ; fanti it et al.1990 ) .",
    "it is now generally believed that csss are physically small objects with sub - galactic dimensions , whose structure and sizes are possibly affected by the ambient gas in the central regions of the parent optical objects .",
    "double - lobed sources represent @xmath0 of the objects in a sample of csss ( fanti et al .",
    "1995 ) selected from the 3cr catalogue ( laing et al .  1983 ) and from the peacock & wall ( 1982 ) catalogue for a linear size @xmath1kpc , spectral index @xmath2 ( s@xmath3 ) and radio power @xmath4whz@xmath5 at 178mhz for the 3cr or @xmath6whz@xmath5 at 2.7ghz ( @xmath7kmsec@xmath5mpc@xmath5 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "fanti at al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that double - lobed csss represent the _ young _ ( @xmath9 yrs ) precursors of the larger double - lobed radio sources .",
    "the remaining 30% might represent a different population , made of sources where the jets are brightened either by doppler boosting or by interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "there are observational results that suggest a connection between radio source evolution and the css and gps ( gigahertzed peaked sources ) phenomena ( see , for example , odea et al .",
    "1991 ; stanghellini et al .",
    "these results also support the hypothesis that the css phenomenon results from expansion within the ambient environment of radio sources at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "this may be due to the existence of a more dense ism in the inner portions of host galaxies with csss .",
    "this density enhancement would influence the behaviour of the radio - emitting regions .    generally speaking ,",
    "the cores are often weak in csss , suggesting that if boosting is present , then jets and cores are misaligned with respect to the kpc - scale jets ( spencer 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , distorted structures on the milli - arcsecond scale are common in those csss which are quasars with strong jets .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on a sample of csss selected because of the large bends in the jets in their inner regions",
    ". we will consider whether the large misalignments are due to relativistic effects or produced by jet - cloud interactions in narrow line regions . in the next section we will describe the sample , our observations of four of the selected sources and the source structures .",
    "we will then summarize the source parameters derived from the observations , and estimate the probability of the collision of a jet with dense gas cloud .",
    "finally , we will discuss the results of our investigations .",
    "we have used the images of sources classified as csss from the compilation by dallacasa & stanghellini ( 1990 ) . from this , we have chosen a sub - sample using quite simple criteria . first , all the sources dominated by jet emission were selected . from this , a list of sources was chosen to include all the sources showing large bent jets on the sub - arcsecond scale . a bend in a jet",
    "is considered _ large _ when the jet major axis changes direction by an angle @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "such a value was adopted to avoid ambiguities in selecting candidates from the published images .",
    "these are due to the uncertainty in determining the position angle ( pa ) of the jet major axis .",
    "we are also aware that the images were made from observations done using a variety of arrays and frequencies , some of which were inappropriate for our purpose .",
    "the selected sources are listed in table  3 below .",
    "observations of four of them by us are presented here .",
    "the four sources ( 0548@xmath12165 , 1741@xmath12279 , 2033@xmath12187 and 2147@xmath12145 ) have been observed with vlbi at 1.6ghz and 5ghz using different arrays and recording systems .",
    "calibration observations on largely - unresolved radio sources were made during each observing session along with the observations of the target source .",
    "table  1 summarizes the observations . after the correlation process",
    "the bulk of the data reduction was done using the _ aips _ package .",
    "the sources have been imaged using both _ aips _ and _ difmap _ ( shepherd et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the source parameters in table  2 are as follows :  column 1 : source name ; column 2 : observing frequency ; columns 3,4,5 : beam major axis , minor axis in mas and pa in degrees ; column 6 : r.m.s .",

    "( 1995 ) shows that the northernmost component a in the evn @xmath1918 cm image by spencer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is likely to be the core .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath1950 cm vlbi observations of rendong et al .",
    "spencer ( 1994 ) imaged 3c43 at @xmath1918 cm with merlin .",
    "that image shows a bridge of emission between the main components and the northern component .",
    "the jet is straight and collimated for the first 150 mas , then it changes pa by @xmath20 and , after 75 mas the pa changes again by @xmath21 pointing towards east .",

    "the intrinsic magnetic field direction in the central component follows the curvature of the source faithfully .    * 3c99 * ( 0358@xmath12004 )    the radio source 3c99 has a triple structure on arcsecond scales .",

    "1997 ) and it is likely to be the nucleus of 3c99 .",
    "the vlbi image of the source at @xmath1918 cm shows that the central component consists of several blobs of emission with the two prominent ones being significantly misaligned with the overall axis of the source .    * 3c119 * ( 0429@xmath12415 )    an image of the source structure with an angular resolution of 5 mas is presented by nan ren - dong et al .",
    "component a has an inverted spectral index and it is identified with the core of 3c119 .",
    "the morphology of 3c119 is rather peculiar .",
    "the jet emerging from the core component is not well collimated .",
    "it contains several blobs of emission . the major axis pa changes direction by @xmath25 to reach the component c , at about 40 mas from the core .",
    "from there , it changes direction several times to form an almost circular structure .",
    "the core has a radio luminosity which is @xmath26 of the source total luminosity at 5 ghz .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1992 ) listed 3c119 among sources with very large rotation measures ( rm@xmath273400  rad  m@xmath23 ) .",
    "a number of possible explanations have been discussed in the paper by nan ren - dong et al.(1991 ) for the source s brightness distribution ( e.g.  rotational shear of the radio jet by an ambient rotating gaseous disk , precession in the nucleus , and the source expanding in a cavity in the interstellar medium ) , but those authors admit that they can not reach a satisfactory conclusion .    * 3c147 * ( 0538@xmath12498 )    3c147 has been observed by several investigators ; see , for example , the collection of images by alef et al .",

    "fig.2 also shows that the jet increases its width but it remains collimated and it seems to show a wiggling structure .",
    "the core is thought to be the easternmost component , since it has a flat spectrum .",
    "the detection of the secondary component about 3 arcsec north , suggests that either there is a counter jet or the vlbi jet bends back to the north .    * 3c287 * ( 1328 + 254 )    the image of 3c287 at @xmath196 cm with 7 mas resolution shows a regularly curving jet - like structure ; this bears some similarity to that in 3c119 ( fanti et al .",

    "the sites where the bends occur are very close to the cores of the sources . the angular separation from the core to that location ranges between 15 and 300mas , which corresponds to a linear separation of 40900pc , which is well inside the respective narrow line regions ( nlrs ) .    in general , most of the sources have a * very * high rotation measure .",
    "the sources are too compact to allow arcsecond - scale rm images .",
    "those sources which are not polarized are also the most compact among those listed ; this might be interpreted as due to large changes in the magnetic field direction within the angular resolution of the synthesized beam . in such cases ,",
    "vlbi polarimetry is required ; see , for example , the observations of 1442@xmath12101 ( udomprasert et al .  1997 )",
    "the list of csss compiled by dallacasa & stanghellini ( 1990 ) contains @xmath33130 objects . about 30% of these ( i.e.  @xmath54 objects )",
    "are dominated by the emission from the jet structure .",
    "table  3 contains 11 objects with strongly bent jets , which represents about 30% of this sub - sample of csss ( or @xmath338% of the total number of csss ) which is a reasonably - significant number .    if we consider instead the complete sample of csss defined by fanti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which contains 43 objects then five of them , i.e.  @xmath3311% , are listed in table  3 .",
    "this confirms that a strongly - bent jet is a noticeable phenomenon among this class of object .    as a comparison sample",
    ", we have taken the compilation of 293 flat - spectrum radio sources constructed by taylor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which gives a complete flux density limited vlbi sample .",
    "following wilkinson ( 1995 ) , 82% of objects in this sample are classified as asymmetric core - jet sources .",
    "we have found only 4 sources in this sample which exhibit a bent jet fitting the selection criteria , and on the same scales , that we have used for the csss listed in table  3 . this number represents less than 2% of the objects in the complete sample and",
    "is much less than that found for the css complete sample .",
    "this last number should be treated with some care , however .",
    "the observations of the flat spectrum sample were made with a high resolution vlbi array , limited in sensitivity by the snap - shot observing strategy adopted .",
    "deeper observations might change the number of objects with large bent jets .",
    "however , we consider the large fraction of objects with a strongly - bent jet among csss as an indication that the propagation of the jet is strongly affected by the ambient medium .",
    "let us calculate the probability of a collision between the jet and the dense gas clouds in the nlr surrounding the radio source .",
    "the outer gas is characterized by temperature of @xmath55 , a particle density of @xmath56@xmath57 and by a filling factor @xmath58 ( mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "the number of clouds , b , that the jet will encounter in a distance _",
    "l _ is given by : @xmath59 where _ n _ the total number of clouds , _",
    "l _ is the size of a narrow line region , _",
    "d _ the diameter of a cloud , and _",
    "n _ is the cloud spatial density @xmath60 . the diameter _ d _ and the density _",
    "n _ of these dense gas clouds in active galaxies with @xmath61 is still uncertain .",
    "the term b can be expressed more appropriately in terms of the filling factor .    the radio jet propagates in a single preferred direction",
    "; thus we are interested in determining the linear filling factor @xmath62 , which is defined as : @xmath63 the term on the right is , by definition , the _ volume filling factor _ @xmath64 . such an expression is valid if the jet diameter is @xmath65 , the cloud s diameter . from this , one can derive @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be calculated as : @xmath68    to estimate b , we have adopted the following values : ( a ) the linear size _",
    "l _ of the nlrs can be taken to be in the range 110  kpc .",
    "this range is suggested by the bends which occur inside the first kpc from the core and from the fact that we are dealing with csss whose linear size can not exceed 1520 kpc by definition ; ( b ) the filling factor @xmath69 is @xmath70 .",
    "however , from the luminosity in strong lines like h@xmath71 in the nlr ( @xmath72 ergss@xmath5 in seyfert 2s ) and electron density of 10@xmath73 @xmath57 , the filling factor can reach values as large as 10@xmath23 ( see , for example , peterson 1997 ) ; ( c ) in nearby agn , the nlrs are often partially resolved by the observations and the inferred sizes are generally @xmath74100 pc .",
    "this gives an upper limit to the diameter @xmath75 for a cloud . in our own galaxy ,",
    "dense clouds are characterized by sizes of 110 pc ( cowie & sangaila 1986 ; cox & reynolds 1987 ) .",
    "thus the cloud diameters can be taken to be in the range 10100 pc . moreover , from the vlbi observations we see that the jets are not resolved in a direction transverse to the major axis , with an angular resolution of @xmath76mas ( about 10 pc for @xmath77 ) .    from these considerations , and assuming that the jet diameter is @xmath65 , then b will fall in the range 0.10.01 .",
    "this last value is not just the number of collisions between the radio jet and the dense gas cloud in a css .",
    "it also represents the fraction of sources which suffer for such an interaction . here",
    "we wish to stress that the chances of such a collision are not very small .    the dallacasa & stanghellini ( 1990 ) list of csss contains more than one hundred objects .",
    "the percentage of csss which show large bends in the propagation direction of the radio jet is a number which is roughly in agreement with the value derived here .",
    "the above considerations also indicate that the the probability of multiple bends is quite small .",
    "sub - arcsecond resolution vlbi maps of csss often show that these sources have strongly - distorted structures with recognizable jet - like features ( fanti et al .  1986 ; spencer et al .",
    "1991 ) , consistent with strong dynamical interactions between the jets and the ambient media .",
    "although the largest distortions are often seen in sources dominated by jets , and there are suggestions that this might at least partly be due to projection effects ( e.g.  spencer 1994 ) , there are clear indications that intrinsic distortions due to interactions with a possibly - dense inhomogeneous gaseous environment play an important role . for example , some of the most distorted and complex structures are found in objects with very weak cores , as in the quasars 3c43 and 3c119 .",
    "such objects should be inclined at large enough angles to the line of sight that projection effects are not very significant .",
    "generally speaking , csss usually show very weak cores compared to the jet emission while in superluminal sources the doppler boosted cores are the components with the more dominant emission . moreover , the only csss known so far which exhibit superluminal separation between two components , thus implying a small angle of inclination to the line of sight , are 3c147 ( @xmath78 ; alef et al .  1990 ) and 3c138 ( @xmath79 ; cotton et al .",
    "in addition to the distorted structures , an increased asymmetry in the location of the outer components also suggests that the components are evolving through a dense asymmetric environment in the central regions of these galaxies ( sanghera et al .",
    "1995 ; saikia 1995 ) .",
    "such an asymmetry between the mas structure and the arcsec structure is present where an arcsec structure is detected for sources in table  3 .",
    "most csss show low ( @xmath33 1@xmath80 ) percentage polarizations at or below 5 ghz ( saikia 1991 ; saikia , singal & cornwell 1987 ) .",
    "the median polarization , however , increases with frequency , ( van breugel et al .",
    "1992 ; saikia 1995 ) suggesting that the polarimetric behaviour is due to faraday depolarization .",
    "this pattern is consistent with the observation of garrington and akujor ( 1996 ) that smaller sources show stronger depolarization .",
    "a number of sources with very high rotation measures in the range of several thousands of radm@xmath23 are also csss .",
    "most of the sources in table  3 follow this trend having large depolarization and do have rather large rms .",
    "sub - arcsec polarimetry has often provided evidence in favour of the interaction of these components with dense clouds of gas .",
    "for example , the southern component of 3c147 has a much higher rm than the northern component , is brighter , closer to the nucleus , and has the expected signatures of a jet colliding with a cloud of gas on the southern side of the galaxy ( junor et al .",
    "1997 ) . to explain both the low polarizations at centimeter wavelengths and the small linear sizes",
    ", it has been proposed that csss are cocooned in dense gaseous envelopes ( e.g.   mantovani et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "existing ground - based optical observations show that narrow - line luminosities are comparable for csss and large - sized radio sources . however ,",
    "broader narrow - line profiles found for csss suggest that the interaction of the jet with the ambient medium produces additional accelerations ( gelderman 1992 ; morganti 1993 ; gelderman & whittle 1994 ) . from the information available in the literature , it is not clear whether there is enough gas to support the so - called frustration scenario for csss , in which they are confined to small dimensions by dense interstellar media , thus hindering their evolution into classical frii radio sources .",
    "the structures of the sources shown here , with such large bent jets in the vicinity of the core , support the view of a strong interaction between the jet flow and dense gas clouds .",
    "this is in agreement with our estimate of the probability of having an interaction between the jet and a dense cloud of gas inside the first kpc from the nucleus .",
    "we predict that the widths of the narrow emission lines in these sources will be broader that for nlrgs ( narrow line radio galaxies ) .",
    "the interaction between the radio source and the ism has been investigated , with time - dependent numerical simulations of jets associated with csss , by de young ( 1993 ) in the following scenarios : _ a ) _ the ism is an uniform homogeneous medium , with a smooth density gradient ; _ b ) _ the ism is in two phases  a hot tenuous gas together with a population of cold dense clouds ; _ c ) _ the interaction is with a single large feature such a very dense cloud . de young shows that csss of low and intermediate luminosity can be confined by an ism of average density 10 times that of the galaxy .",
    "confinement of the highest luminosity sources requires an ism of unrealistic density and total mass .",
    "the population as a whole can be confined if the jets are intrinsically more efficient , by factors of 10 or more , than is commonly assumed for ` normal ' radio sources .",
    "the physics of jet - cloud collisions have been investigated by de young ( 1991 ) and norman & balsara ( 1993 ) in 3-d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "norman & balsara do identify a fluid dynamical mechanism which maintains the collimation of the jet for all deflection angles @xmath81 .",
    "the reflected jet inherits the stability properties of the original jet .",
    "de young shows that deflection of a jet in the case of jet - loud encounters over the short times ( @xmath82 years ) and distances ( 2 to 4 kpc ) needed for csss may easily occur .",
    "fanti et al .  ( 1995 ) have distinguished between double - lobed csss , which represent @xmath83 of the population and complex morphologied or asymmetric jet - dominated csss .",
    "they suggest that double - lobed csss represent the precursors of the large , double - lobed radio sources .",
    "the remaining 30% are sources with the jets brightened by doppler boosting or by interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "the sources in table  3 are classified as core - jet objects .",
    "the evidence that doppler boosting can play a role in magnifying the large distortions seen in the jets is very weak .",
    "radio structures , large rms , and broader narrow line profiles support the view that large bent jets can be caused by interactions between the jets and dense gas clouds in the nlrs .",
    "even a rough statistical computation indicates that the probability of a bump in the nlrs is statistically significant .",
    "3-d hydrodynamical simulations of extragalactic jets reveal interesting features that further support this interpretation . in this picture , sources like 3c119 and 3c287 require more than one collision to createstructures that are spiral - like .",
    "such cases can not be excluded statistically , though they are very unlikely .",
