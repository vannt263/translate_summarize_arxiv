    "<S> we modify a stellar structure code to estimate the effect upon the main sequence of the accretion of weakly interacting dark matter onto stars and its subsequent annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the effect upon the stars depends upon whether the energy generation rate from dark matter annihilation is large enough to shut off the nuclear burning in the star . </S>",
    "<S> main sequence wimp burners look much like protostars moving on the hayashi track , although they are in principle completely stable . </S>",
    "<S> we make some brief comments about where such stars could be found , how they might be observed and more detailed simulations which are currently in progress . </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment on whether or not it is possible to link the paradoxically young ob stars found at the galactic centre with wimp burners .    </S>",
    "<S> there is growing evidence that for each gram of baryonic matter in the universe , there are around five grams of dark matter which does not couple to the electromagnetic force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the more convincing candidates for this dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . </S>",
    "<S> because wimps have masses and couplings close to the weak scale , they naturally give rise to a relic abundance of dark matter close to that observed after freeze out in the early universe .    because wimps couple weakly to standard model particles , there is a small but non - zero wimp - nucleon cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the tightest constraints for the spin - independent cross section come from the xenon experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wimp - nucleon interaction means that some wimps are gravitationally captured by stars , a process which has been well studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually the focus of such investigations is the possibility of dark matter annihilating into high energy neutrinos , which then escape the star to be potentially detected by neutrino experiments like icecube . </S>",
    "<S> if the accretion of dark matter were large enough however , one might expect that the stars themselves could change .    the first way wimps can affect a star is by annihilating into standard model particles in its core , providing another energy source in addition to standard nuclear burning . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to stars where the energy produced by wimp annihilations is greater than or comparable to that from nuclear burning as ` wimp burners ' . </S>",
    "<S> recent work has focused upon white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we instead focus on main sequence wimp burners . </S>",
    "<S> previous work in this direction was carried out by salati & silk @xcite some years ago , in the context of cosmion dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> these authors used an @xmath0 polytropic approximation to estimate the influence of wimp annihilation on the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we instead employ full numerical solutions to the hydrostatic equations of stellar structure and present results from a simple code , as well as supporting preliminary results from a more advanced code . </S>",
    "<S> we also update the discussion in the context of ` modern wimps ' rather than cosmions , as the nuclear scattering cross - sections and the wimp mass are more constrained than in the past .    </S>",
    "<S> the second way wimps can influence stellar structure is by providing an additional mechanism of heat transport in the core . </S>",
    "<S> this could reduce the local temperature gradient @xcite , potentially inhibiting convection and enhancing the pulsation of horizontal branch stars @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> at least for the sun however , the values currently favoured for the wimp self - annihilation cross section @xcite and the upper limit on the wimp - nucleon cross section @xcite indicate that this effect is not significant @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we neglect heat transport by wimps , but will in a later work include this effect in more detailed , time - dependent simulations @xcite . for the current work </S>",
    "<S> , we have checked that this omission does not affect our results significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments give relatively weak constraints on the spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross section , so it may contribute far more to wimp capture than the spin - independent one . for simplicity , we assume that the spin - dependent cross section dominates and is @xmath1@xmath2 . for a sun - like star with mass @xmath3 , a circular velocity of 220kms@xmath4 , a wimp velocity dispersion of @xmath5kms@xmath4 and a wimp mass of 100gev , </S>",
    "<S> the capture rate ( as calculated with the full capture expressions @xcite in darksusy @xcite ) is then @xmath6 we assume a hydrogen mass fraction of 75% , uniformly distributed in the star . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a good approximation for the sun , but reasonable for newly born stars . </S>",
    "<S> the capture rate on an arbitrary star is then approximately @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the star s mass and @xmath9 its surface escape velocity , @xmath10 is the ambient wimp density and @xmath11 is the wimp mass . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is the average potential at the height of the scattering nuclei ( hydrogen in this case , for which @xmath13 ) . for simplicity , we assume @xmath14 . even if this approximation is not perfect , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : caprate ] ) is only necessary for converting between the ambient wimp density @xmath10 and the capture rate @xmath15 , so it is easy to rescale if the reader wishes . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume @xmath5kms@xmath4 , though for stars in very different environments to our own this must be adjusted . throughout this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use a wimp mass of @xmath16gev although to a first approximation the energy accreted by a star immersed in some fixed density of dark matter is only a function of the cross section , not the mass of the wimp .    </S>",
    "<S> once dark matter is captured by the star , it will form an approximately thermal ( gaussian ) internal distribution , of characteristic radius @xcite @xmath17^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the central density and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> having been concentrated in the centre of the star , the dark matter annihilates with itself , so the equation for the evolution of the number of wimps in the star over time is @xmath20 when @xmath21 , the capture and annihilation rates are in equilibrium and any dark matter which accretes onto the star is instantly converted into additional luminosity . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume that all of the annihilation products interact either electromagnetically or strongly , so that they have short mean free paths in the star and the energy thermalises quickly . </S>",
    "<S> in reality , some fraction of the energy will be lost to neutrinos , but this is a small effect ( typically on the order of 10% or less ) . </S>",
    "<S> the timescale for the steady state to be reached will be much less than the typical evolutionary timescale of a main sequence star , so we assume that this equilibrium has been achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> we studied the effect of this energy input upon stars by altering the fortran code zams @xcite , which looks for stable stellar solutions assuming a constant chemical composition and a simple equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the code was modified by adding the energy generation due to wimp annihilation to the nuclear energy generation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> self gravitating systems have negative specific heat , so as dark matter injects energy into the core of the star , the temperature goes down . </S>",
    "<S> since the nuclear reaction rates depend exponentially on temperature , they are significantly reduced for even a small drop in temperature . as the ambient density of dark matter </S>",
    "<S> is increased and the capture rate goes up , the injection of energy due to wimp annihilations eventually reduces the temperature enough to shut off nuclear burning . </S>",
    "<S> wimp annihilation is then the primary source of the star s luminosity .    </S>",
    "<S> since wimp annihilation occurs in a more centralised region than nuclear burning , the temperature gradient is much steeper in the core of the star than it would otherwise be , and the core becomes convective . outside the core , less energy is generated per unit volume than if nuclear burning were proceeding normally , so the temperature gradient is less . </S>",
    "<S> the actual temperature is lower than in a normal star , but for small dark matter accretion rates it remains high enough to prevent any major increase in opacity , ensuring that energy transport in the region above the core remains radiative . </S>",
    "<S> the energy from the core is easily transmitted through this radiative zone to the surface layers of the star . </S>",
    "<S> the overall radius of the star remains approximately constant while the temperature decreases , so the luminosity also decreases .    </S>",
    "<S> as the wimp accretion rate is raised , the star continues to cool until h@xmath22 ions are able to survive at increasingly large depths below the surface . </S>",
    "<S> if the star did not already have an appreciable surface convection zone , one develops . at high enough wimp capture rates , the surface convection zone merges with the inner zone and the star becomes completely convective . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of more wimps and hence central luminosity beyond this point requires the star to grow in order to transport the additional energy to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the two distinct stages of this ` evolution ' can clearly be seen in figure [ hr ] .        </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows a black solid line corresponding to the zero age main sequence , along with ` evolutionary tracks ' plotted as the ambient density of wimps is increased . </S>",
    "<S> these tracks are strongly reminiscent of the hayashi tracks which proto - stars travel along on the final stages of their evolution towards the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that such stars are shrinking in size on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale as they radiate away gravitational potential energy . in wimp burners </S>",
    "<S> , there is constant energy generation in the core ( provided the wimp capture rate remains constant ) and the stars can in principle remain at that position in the hr diagram for an arbitrarily long time .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of salati & silk @xcite led to qualitatively similar conclusions about the backing up of the main sequence along the hayashi track with increasing wimp density . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes of the tracks are different in our more detailed analysis , and thus the actual positions of the resulting wimp burners in the hr diagram differ . </S>",
    "<S> the effects require higher ambient wimp densities also , as we have considered modern wimps rather than cosmions ( i.e.  with lower nuclear scattering cross - sections ) </S>",
    "<S> .    in figure [ hr ] , tracks for stars of mass 0.8@xmath23 are not complete , and show increasingly large gaps for larger masses . using the modified zams code </S>",
    "<S> , we could not find solutions corresponding to all temperatures between the main sequence stars and the cooler hayashi - like wimp burners . </S>",
    "<S> in figure [ temp ] we plot temperature as a function of ambient wimp density . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity occurs where the temperature of the star drops rapidly , shortly before the star becomes fully convective .    </S>",
    "<S> it was not initially clear whether this lack of solutions was a real effect or an artefact of the code . </S>",
    "<S> we have put some effort into understanding whether some of the physical simplifications in the code ( e.g.  surface boundary conditions , a simplified equation of state and thus too rigid a criterion for the onset of surface convection , or the treatment of convective heat transport itself ) are responsible for the lack of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we could find no evidence to support this idea . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the gaps do not appear to have a physical basis . </S>",
    "<S> they seem to be a numerical artefact arising from the ` shooting ' technique used by the zams code to solve the boundary - value problem of stellar structure . in the region of the gaps , small changes in the stellar radius </S>",
    "<S> cause large changes in the internal temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the surface defined by the discrepancy between the inwardly and outwardly integrated partial solutions employed in this technique then becomes a highly non - trivial function of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finding the global minimum of this function is then nearly impossible without an initial guess extremely close to the true solution , and the algorithm fails to converge .    to check that solutions do exist in this region , </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the gaps using a preliminary version of our next - generation wimp burner code darkstars . </S>",
    "<S> this code has been created from generalised versions of capture routines in darksusy @xcite which use the full capture rate expressions in @xcite , and the stellar evolution package ez @xcite derived from eggleton s stars code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the code is time - dependent , uses relaxation rather than shooting and includes wimp energy transport , more detailed treatments of the wimp distribution , capture rates , equation of state , nuclear reaction rates and opacities . </S>",
    "<S> darkstars and results obtained with it will be described in full in an upcoming publication @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the more detailed code ( figure [ pat ] ) , whilst consistent with the zams code close to the main sequence and in the fully convective regions on the right - hand side of the hr diagram , show that intermediate solutions do exist and that the gaps are not physical . </S>",
    "<S> this cross - check also shows that we can trust the solutions of the zams code , but should nt take the actual gaps in the curves seriously .     </S>",
    "<S> ( upper curve ) and 0.7@xmath23 as a function of wimp density . </S>",
    "<S> a spin dependent wimp - nucleon cross section of @xmath24@xmath2 is assumed . _ _ ]     showing that solutions can be found corresponding to all temperatures when the more sophisticated darkstars code is used . _ _ ]    figure [ temp ] shows that for a spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross section of @xmath24@xmath2 , stars only start to change their behaviour when immersed in a dark matter density of around @xmath25 or @xmath26gev@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this is much larger than the 0.3gev@xmath27 which is thought to be the approximate density of dark matter in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> most modern simulations of galactic dark matter halos do suggest that the density of dark matter should be much higher in the centre of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this density should be made more pronounced by the phenomena of adiabatic contraction and dark matter spikes created around black holes , though tempered by self - annihilation of dark matter and gravitational heating due to the motion of stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested @xcite that densities larger than @xmath25gev@xmath27 can be found at radii closer than @xmath28pc from the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> observational challenges associated with constructing an hr diagram from stars in this crowded field are severe though , as the very centre of the galaxy is shrouded in dust .    finally , we comment upon the ` paradox of youth ' implied by what appear to be hot , young stars close to the central black holes of m31 and our own galaxy @xcite . in our galaxy , these stars look like @xmath2915@xmath23 main sequence stars with luminosities of the order 1,000@xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> . such a massive main sequence star should only be around 10 myr old , so these objects would appear to have formed very recently . however , tidal forces close to the central black hole are thought to be too large to be compatible with the collapse of a gas cloud to begin star formation . </S>",
    "<S> it is not easy to make normal ubv measurements of stellar temperatures at the galactic centre due to extinction , but spectral lines found in the atmosphere of such stars appear to be consistent with a temperature of 30,000 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , then it would be difficult to imagine that these are normal stars which have been converted into fully convective and highly luminous wimp burners from the accretion of dark matter , as such stars would have a temperature of only a few thousand degrees .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation for the ` paradox of youth ' is a combination of collisional stripping of red giant envelopes and merger events @xcite , owing to the high stellar densities near the centres of the two galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , then the anomalously hot stars in fact derive from an older population . </S>",
    "<S> such a population should therefore also contain less luminous , unperturbed stars , including lower mass stars still on the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> provided that this explanation is correct , and if main sequence wimp burners exist at all , then such lower mass stars should be examples of them . with upcoming observations of the galactic centre expected to probe objects as faint as 1@xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , a very real possibility exists for the detection of wimp burners in the near future . </S>"
