    "furthermore , by invoking caffareli s regularity theory for the monge - ampre equation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the authors show that if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are supported on strictly convex domains separated by a hyperplane , then higher regularity on the densities implies higher regularity on @xmath34 in the interior of the active region @xmath41 ( * ? ? ?",

    "as mentioned earlier , figalli s counterexample to @xmath54 regularity of the transport map in the non - disjoint case shows that the assumption of a separating hyperplane plays a crucial role in the regularity theory of the partial transport .",

    "our method has the added feature of allowing us to identify , in a very specific way , the geometry of the singular set which comes up in the work of caffarelli and mccann and prove the general uniform localization lemma under assumptions which in the disjoint case turn out to be weaker than the ones found in their work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 7.11 ) ( cf . remark [ rem111 ] ) .",

    ", caffarelli and mccann discovered that this set consists of nontransverse intersection points of fixed with free boundary and points that map to non - locally convex parts of the path - connected target region .",
    "therefore , even in this case , one may not directly apply the implicit function theorem to obtain an estimate on its hausdorff dimension .",
    "however , we exploit the geometry in the uniform localization lemma to prove that in addition to the above description , nontransverse singular points also have the property that when one shoots rays to infinity emanating from these points and in the direction of the normal to the boundary , the half - lines that are generated intersect the closure of the target region only along its boundary ( see e.g. figure [ xenon ] and the set @xmath60 in lemma [ d ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this geometry is sufficient to connect the singular set with projections of convex sets onto other convex sets and prove a corresponding rectifiability result ; this is the content of proposition [ geom2b ] .",
    "mathematically , the previous discussion takes the following form : if the supports of the densities are separated by a hyperplane , then as previously mentioned , caffarelli and mccann prove @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a closed set ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 7.15 ) .",
    "we generalize an improvement of this result to the non - disjoint case . indeed ,",
    "our result states that there exists a closed set @xmath61 for which @xmath62 , and if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 ( see corollary [ cor1 ] and remark [ frem ] ) . moreover , thanks to the general uniform localization lemma ( lemma [ d ] ) , we are able to identify the set @xmath65 explicitly in terms of the geometry of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; using this information we prove that if the supports are uniformly convex with @xmath9 boundaries , then the singular set for the free boundaries is relatively closed ( away from the common region @xmath66 ) and @xmath10 @xmath11-finite in the general case and compact with @xmath10 finite measure in the disjoint case ; this is the content of theorem [ thhm ] .",
