    "4 and 5 however , the most important contribution of such a small effect , related with the 2des screening in the middle of the channel for @xmath0 is taken into account in figs . 1 - 3 .",
    "the self - consistent treatment developed here , for 2des in the @xmath0 qhe regime , shows that edge - state correlations drastically modify the ( @xmath124 ) ll spectrum in a wide region ( with width @xmath285 ) nearby the channel edge , i.e. the effect of correlations induced by edge - states is essentially nonlocal .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the position of the fermi level @xmath127 is highly asymmetric within the gap defined by the ( @xmath119 ) and ( @xmath128 ) lls in the interior , or `` bulk '' part of the channel due to such correlations .",
    "the activation gap is much smaller than the fermi gap .",
    "in addition , we have obtained analytical expressions for the activation gap and for the edge - state group velocity @xmath286 renormalized by exchange and correlations effects .",
    "we have obtained that @xmath287}\\ll 1 $ ] , where @xmath288 is the edge group velocity in the hfa , @xmath289 is the normalized group velocity , such that @xmath290 is the smoothness requirement for the pertinent confining potential , and @xmath291 is a small parameter . in particular , for the experimental parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , used in fig . 5",
    ", we calculate @xmath292 .",
    "so while @xmath293 the value of @xmath294 .",
    "then , in this case , edge - state correlations have decreased the group velocity by a factor of @xmath295 , as we can see from the slopes of pertinent solid and dashed curves in fig . 5 , such that effective one - electron confining potential @xmath296 is smooth .    about the role of correlations in the position of the fermi level within the gap between spin - down and spin - up lls in the bulk",
    ", we point out that the exchange interaction ( hfa ) leads the fermi level to a position slightly above the middle of the large exchange enhanced gap , tending to it only when @xmath297 . because the correlations strongly reduce the exchange contribution only nearby the edges , the physical consequence is that the position of the fermi level within the @xmath0 gap , should be strongly asymmetric when both exchange and correlations are taken into account .",
    "indeed , in the actual situation , @xmath298 this asymmetry comes from the fact that the many - body contribution ( the third term of eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) ) goes @xmath299 while the hartree term ( the second of eq . ( [ 16 ] ) ) behaves like @xmath300 . only for relatively large @xmath114 ,",
    "the hartree term becomes dominant because the many - body contribution tends to be constant .",
    "even though we have used a simple analytical expression for the confining potential , obtained in the hartree approximation as the sum of the bare confining potential and the hartree potential , it often reproduces quite well numerical results of the confining potential of a real wide channel calculated in the hartree approximation .",
    "moreover , the above treatment can be easily extended on the confining potential , obtained within hartree approximation , of a different form , if it is smooth on the scale of @xmath301 .",
    "our results were obtained by developing a generalized local density approximation ( glda ) in which the single - particle confining potential @xmath302 incorporates exchange and nonlocal correlation effects .",
