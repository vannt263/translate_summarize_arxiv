    "the early wind ( @xmath63 ) results in a larger entropy jump , which has the larger kinetic energy to be converted to thermal energy ( fig .  1 ; _ top left _ ) .",
    "the termination - shocked entropies in the early winds are appreciably higher , despite their significantly lower unshocked entropies than those in the late winds .    the hydrodynamic study by @xcite shows variations of @xmath19 with time as well as depending on the progenitor masses , ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 . in figure  2 , the wind solutions for @xmath66 ( _ red lines _ ) as an extreme case",

    "the unshocked asymptotic entropies for @xmath69 are about a factor of two higher than those for @xmath70 ( fig .  2 , _ bottom left _ ) owing to general relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find larger entropy jumps for @xmath71 because of the somewhat faster radial velocities ( fig .  2 , _ top left _ ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the termination - shocked entropies for @xmath66 are appreciably higher than those for @xmath70 .",
    "all the above aspects are qualitatively similar to those found in the hydrodynamic results by @xcite . for example , in their fiducial model ( with @xmath72 resulting from the @xmath55 progenitor ) , the unshocked and shocked entropies at @xmath73  s after core bounce ( @xmath74 and @xmath75  km ) are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "our semi - analytic approach is therefore quite useful to obtain the thermodynamic histories of termination - shocked winds , which are consistent with detailed hydrodynamic results at qualitative levels .",
    "we note that the termination - shocked outflow merges with the preceding supernova ejecta and it can not be regarded as a wind any more .",
    "the hydrodynamic calculations show that the shocked outflows further decelerate to be nearly constant velocities ( e.g. , fig .  5 in * ?",
    "* ) when accumulated in a dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "nevertheless , we apply the wind solutions for the termination - shocked outflows as described in ",
    "2 . as a consequence ,",

    ". it should be noted , however , that the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis ceases only within @xmath82  s after ( or , in some cases , even before ) the wind termination in the current nucleosynthesis calculations (   4 , see also * ? ? ?",
    "our treatment may be thus reasonable for the current purpose ( i.e. , for nucleosynthesis ) , since the time variations of temperature and density during such a short timescale would be negligible in the shock - decelerated outflows .",
    "figure  3 shows relations between the entropies @xmath83 and the temperatures @xmath84 just above the shock radii for various @xmath38 cases .",

    "circles _ ) .",
    "as seen in figure  3 , the entropy jump occurs only when the temperature decreases below @xmath91 ( at which the @xmath0-process begins ) .",
    "we find a trend that @xmath92 is systematically higher in earlier ( i.e. , higher @xmath24 ) winds , while @xmath19 is less sensitive to @xmath92 . as an extreme case",
    ", we also display the results with @xmath93 , @xmath94  km , and @xmath95 ( _ dashed line _ ) . in these cases ,",
    "the entropy jump occurs at a smaller @xmath38 and thus at significantly higher temperature , but the resulting entropy is only moderate ( @xmath96 ) for @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , the neutrino sphere at earlier times would be significantly larger than 10  km and thus the entropy would be lower than the current case .",
    "moreover , matter in the earlier winds with @xmath98 would be proton - rich @xcite , in which no @xmath0-processing is expected .",
    "we conclude , therefore , the entropy jump by termination - shock heating does not help to enhance the neutron - to - seed ratio prior to the @xmath0-process ( @xmath99 ) .",

    "one may consider , however , a large entropy jump during @xmath0-processing affects the nucleosynthetic path and modifies the final abundance curve .",

    "the entropy jumps by the termination - shock heating have negligible effects on the final @xmath0-process curve .",

    "our approach was based on the simple steady state wind solutions with arbitrary chosen ( but reasonable ) input parameters , although our results are qualitatively consistent with more detailed hydrodynamic results by @xcite .",

    "this condition @xmath238 ( as well as high neutron number density , @xmath240  @xmath35 ) has in fact long been considered as a physical requirement to account for the solar @xmath0-process abundance curve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a massive progenitor forms a massive proto - neutron star , in which general relativistic effects may in part help to increase entropy and reduce expansion timescale @xcite .",
    "second is , in contrast , a star of @xmath241 near the low - mass end of supernova - progenitor range .",
    "@xcite show that , in their @xmath242 case , the termination shock propagated outward quickly owing to the steep density gradient , in which the temperature at @xmath38 dropped to @xmath243 after 10 seconds . in this case , the lighter part ( @xmath3 ) of the solar @xmath0-process curve should be formed in shock - decelerated early winds , in which the ( shocked ) temperature is still as high as @xmath244 .",
    "the heavier part may be followed in later winds , in which the @xmath0-process proceeds in very low temperatures ( cold @xmath0-process , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism to obtain requisite physical conditions for the @xmath0-process in such a supernova , however , has been lacking .    needless to say",
    ", we can not exactly constrain the mass range of supernova progenitors on the basis of our current ( only suggestive ) results .",
    "it is likely , however , that the ( shocked ) temperatures in intermediate progenitor cases ( e.g. , @xmath246 ) stay at @xmath247 for long time , in which the third peak abundances may be lower - shifted compared to the solar @xmath0-process curve ( fig .",
    "7 , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should be also noted that the subsonic outflow has higher temperature than that in the transonic wind at any radii .",
    "we can not exclude , therefore , possibilities that these progenitors provide suitable temperature @xmath248 during the @xmath0-process .",
    "@xcite show , however , that all their simulations with `` standard '' parameter settings resulted in forming supersonic outflows within 10 seconds after core bounce .",
    "only a subset of simulations with somewhat `` extreme '' parameter choices appeared to have the transiting features between transonic and subsonic outflows .",
    "given that our speculations above are correct , it is still difficult to specify which of @xmath241 or @xmath236 stars are the dominant sources of the galactic @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "both cases can potentially reproduce the whole mass range of the solar @xmath0-process curve ( but pb abundance can be substantially different , see fig .  7 and * ? ? ?",
    "detailed nucleosynthesis calculations in time - evolving neutrino - driven winds with the termination shock will be needed to draw more definitive answers .",
    "it should be also noted that we assumed only spherically symmetric outflows in this study , while recent hydrodynamic studies suggest some decisive roles of multidimensional effects on the mechanism of neutrino - driven explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
