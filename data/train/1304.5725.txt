    "wsns are currently being considered for many applications ; including industrial , security surveillance , medical , environmental and weather monitoring . due to limited battery lifetime at each sensor node ; minimizing transmitter @xmath2 to increase energy efficiency and network lifetime is useful .",
    "sensor nodes consist of three parts ; sensing unit , processing unit and transceiver  @xcite .",
    "limited battery requires low power sensing , processing and communication system .",
    "energy efficiency is of paramount interest and optimal wsn should consume minimum amount of power .    in wsns",
    ", sensor nodes are widely deployed in different environments to collect data .",
    "as sensor nodes usually operate on limited battery , so each sensor node communicate using a low power wireless link and link quality varies significantly due to environmental dynamics like temperature , humidity etc .",
    "therefore , while maintaining good link quality between sensor nodes we need to reduce energy consumption for data transmission to extend network lifetime  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "ieee802.15.4 is a standard used for low energy , low data rate applications like wsn .",
    "this standard operate at frequency 2.45 ghz with channels up to 16 and data rate 250 kbps .    to efficiently compensate link quality changes due to temperature variations ,",
    "we propose a new scheme for @xmath2 control east , that improves network lifetime while achieving required reliability between sensor nodes .",
    "this scheme is based on combination of open - loop and closed - loop feedback processes in which we divide network into three regions on basis of threshold on @xmath3 for each region . in open - loop process , each node estimates link quality using its temperature sensor .",
    "estimated link quality degradation is then effectively compensated using closed - loop feedback process by applying propose scheme . in closed - loop feedback process , appropriate transmission @xmath2 control is obtained which assign substantially less power than those required in existing transmission power control schemes .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii briefs the related existing work and motivation for this work . in section iii , we provide the readers with our proposed scheme . in section iv",
    ", we model our proposed scheme .",
    "experimental results have been given in section v.",
    "to transmit data efficiently over wireless channels in wsns , existing schemes set some minimum transmission @xmath2 for maintaining reliability .",
    "these schemes either decrease interference among sensor nodes or increase unnecessary energy consumption . in order to adjust transmission @xmath2 , reference node periodically broadcasts a beacon message . when nodes hear a beacon message from a reference node , nodes transmit an ack message . through this interaction , reference node",
    "estimate connectivity between nodes .    in local mean algorithm ( lma ) ,",
    "a reference node broadcasts lifemsg message .",
    "nodes transmit lifeackmsg after they receive lifemsg .",
    "reference nodes count number of lifeackmsgs and transmission @xmath2 to maintain appropriate connectivity .",
    "for example , if number of lifeackmsgs is less than nodeminthresh ; transmission @xmath2 is increased .",
    "in contrast , if number of lifeackmsgs is more than nodemaxthresh transmission ; @xmath2 is decreased . as a result , they provide improvement of network lifetime in a sufficiently connected network . however , lma only guarantees connectivity between nodes and can not estimate link quality  @xcite .",
    "local information no topology / local information link - state topology ( lint / lilt ) and dynamic transmission power control ( dtpc ) use @xmath3 to estimate transmitter @xmath2 .",
    "nodes exceeding threshold @xmath3 are regarded as neighbor nodes with reliable links .",
    "transmission @xmath2 also controlled by packet reception ratio ( prr ) metric . as for the neighbor selection method ,",
    "three different methods have been used in the literature : connectivity based , prr based and @xmath3 based . in lint / lilt , a node maintains a list of neighbors whose @xmath3 values are higher than the threshold @xmath3 , and it adjusts the radio transmission @xmath2 if number of neighbors is outside the predetermined bound . in lma / lmn , a node determines its range by counting how many other nodes acknowledged to the beacon message it has sent  @xcite .",
    "adaptive transmission power control ( atpc ) adjusts transmission @xmath2 dynamically according to spatial and temporal effects .",
    "this scheme tries to adapt link quality that changes over time by using closed - loop feedback .",
    "however , in large - scale wsns , it is difficult to support scalability due to serious overhead required to adjust transmission @xmath2 of each link .",
    "the result of applying atpc is that every node knows the proper transmission @xmath2 to use for each of its neighbors , and every node maintains good link qualities with its neighbors by dynamically adjusting the transmission @xmath2 through on - demand feedback packets .",
    "uniquely , atpc adopts a feedback - based and pairwise transmission @xmath2 control . by collecting the link quality history ,",
    "atpc builds a model for each neighbor of the node .",
    "this model represents an in - situ correlation between transmission @xmath2 and link qualities .",
    "with such a model , atpc tunes the transmission @xmath2 according to monitored link quality changes .",
    "the changes of transmission @xmath2 reflect changes in the surrounding environment  @xcite .",
    "existing approaches estimate variety of link quality indicators by periodically broadcasting a beacon message . in addition",
    ", feedback process is repeated for adaptively controlling transmission @xmath2 . in adapting link quality for environmental changes , where temperature variation occur ,",
    "packet overhead for transmission @xmath2 control should be minimized . reducing number of control packets",
    "while maintaining reliability is an important technical issue  @xcite .",
    "radio communication quality between low power sensor devices is affected by spatial and temporal factors .",
    "the spatial factors include the surrounding environment , such as terrain and the distance between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "temporal factors include surrounding environmental changes in general , such as weather conditions ( temperature ) .",
    "to establish an effective transmission @xmath2 control mechanism , we need to understand the dynamics between link quality and @xmath3 values .",
    "wireless link quality refers to the radio channel communication performance between a pair of nodes .",
    "prr is the most direct metric for link quality .",
    "however , the prr value can only be obtained statistically over a long period of time .",
    "@xmath3 can be used effectively as binary link quality metrics for transmission @xmath2 control  @xcite .",
    "radio irregularity results in radio signal strength variation in different directions , but the signal strength at any point within the radio transmission range has a detectable correlation with transmission power in a short time period .",
    "there are three main reasons for the fluctuation in the @xmath3 .",
    "first , fading causes signal strength variation at any specific distance .",
    "second , the background noise impairs the channel quality seriously when the radio signal is not significantly stronger than the noise signal .",
    "third , the radio hardware does nt provide strictly stable functionality  @xcite .    since the variation is small , this relation can be approximated by a linear curve .",
    "the correlation between @xmath3 and transmission @xmath2 is approximately linear .",
    "correlation between transmission @xmath2 and @xmath3 is largely influenced by environments , and this correlation changes over time . both the shape and the degree of variation depend on the environment .",
    "this correlation also dynamically fluctuates when the surrounding environmental conditions change .",
    "the fluctuation is continuous , and the changing speed depends on many factors , among which the degree of environmental variation is one of the main factors  @xcite .",
    "propose energy efficient transmission scheme east helps efficiently compensate link quality changes due to temperature variation . to reduce packet overhead for adaptive power control temperature measured by sensors is utilized to adjust transmission @xmath2 for all three regions based on @xmath3 .",
    "compared to single region in which large control packets overhead occur even due to small change in link quality .",
    "closed - loop feedback process is executed to minimize control packets overhead and required transmitter @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we present energy efficient transmission scheme that maintains link quality during temperature variation in wireless environment .",
    "it utilizes open - loop process based on sensed temperature information according to temperature variation . closed - loop feedback process based on control packets",
    "is further used to accurately adjust transmission @xmath2 . by adopting both open - loop and closed - loop feedback processes we divide network into three regions a , b , c for high , medium and low @xmath3 respectively .        in order to assign minimum and reachable transmission @xmath2 to each link east is designed .",
    "east has two phases that is initial and run - time . in initial phase reference",
    "node build a model for nodes in network . in run - time phase",
    "based on previous model east adapt the link quality to dynamically maintain each link with respect to time . in a relatively stable network ,",
    "control overhead occurs only in measuring link quality in initial phase .",
    "but in a relatively unstable network because link quality is continuously changing initial phase is repeated and serious overhead occur .",
    "before we present block diagram for proposed scheme some variables are defined as follows ( 1)current nodes in a region @xmath1 ( 2 ) desired nodes in a region @xmath4 ( 3 ) error : e(t ) = @xmath5,(4 ) @xmath2 .",
    "fig1 shows system block diagram of proposed scheme .",
    "prr , ack , and @xmath3 used to determine connectivity .",
    "ack estimates connectivity but it can not determine link quality . prr estimates connectivity accurately but it causes significant overhead  @xcite . in our scheme , we use @xmath3 for connectivity estimation , which measures connectivity with relatively low overhead .    power controller adjusts transmission @xmath2 by utilizing both number of current nodes and temperature sensed at each node . since power controller is operated not merely by comparing number of current nodes with desired nodes but by using temperature - compensated @xmath2 , so that it can reach to desired @xmath2 rapidly .",

    "network connectivity maintained with low overhead by reducing feedback process between nodes which is achieved due to logical division of network .",

    "<S> one of the major challenges in design of wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) is to reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes to prolong lifetime of finite - capacity batteries . in this paper , we propose energy - efficient adaptive scheme for transmission ( east ) in wsns . </S>",
    "<S> east is an ieee 802.15.4 standard compliant . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> open - loop is used for temperature - aware link quality estimation and compensation . whereas , closed - loop feedback process helps to divide network into three logical regions to minimize overhead of control packets . </S>",
    "<S> threshold on transmitter power loss @xmath0 and current number of nodes ( @xmath1 ) in each region help to adapt transmit power level ( @xmath2 ) according to link quality changes due to temperature variation . </S>",
    "<S> evaluation of propose scheme is done by considering mobile sensor nodes and reference node both static and mobile . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that propose scheme effectively adapts transmission @xmath2 to changing link quality with less control packets overhead and energy consumption as compared to classical approach with single region in which maximum transmitter @xmath2 assigned to compensate temperature variation .    </S>",
