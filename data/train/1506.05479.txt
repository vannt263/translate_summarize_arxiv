    "the discovery of graphene and topological insulators has significantly boosted the ubiquity of condensed matter realizations of dirac fermions as emergent electronic excitations at low - energy  @xcite .",
    "dirac electrons in condensed matter systems have enjoyed an enormous amount of interest both from a fundamental and technological application perspective  @xcite .",
    "a key difference between graphene and topological insulators is the number of species , or valleys , of dirac fermions and their locations in momentum space .",
    "topological insulators ( ti ) protected by time reversal symmetry host a single - valley dirac fermion , which is pinned to a time - reversal - invariant ( tri ) momentum in the surface brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , graphene hosts two valleys of dirac fermions located at non - tri momenta  @xcite , each valley having an additional spin degeneracy . more recently",
    ", a new type of dirac fermions was discovered on the surface of topological crystalline insulators ( tci ) snte , ( sn , pb)se and ( sn , pb)te  @xcite , which are protected by mirror symmetry of the crystal  @xcite . these dirac fermions exhibit spin - momentum locking as in tis ; however , there is an even number of dirac cones at non - tri momenta , a feature similar to graphene",
    ".    in general , when dirac points are located at non - tri momenta , nonmagnetic perturbations such as strain are able to move dirac points in momentum space , thereby acting as an effective gauge field on dirac fermions .",
    "for example , strain induces opposite gauge fields for the two dirac valleys in graphene , and spatially inhomogeneous strain gives rise to effective magnetic fields that are opposite in two valleys , preserving time reversal symmetry  @xcite . in the presence of such a pseudo - magnetic field @xmath0 , the low - energy electronic structure takes the form of pseudo - landau levels ( plls ) with energies characteric of dirac electrons in magnetic fields , i.e. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the landau level ( ll ) index .",
    "key signatures of pseudo - magnetic fields have been experimentally observed in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the plls have a large single - particle degeneracy , which makes them susceptible to many - body instabilities in a manner similar to magnetic - field induced lls  @xcite .",
    "electronic interactions are expected to lift the degeneracy and drive the system into various gapped states .",
    "two primary examples are spin - polarized and valley - polarized states of plls in graphene  @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider interacting dirac electrons under _ periodically _ modulated pseudo - magnetic fields , where regions of positive and negative fields alternate in space , forming a superlattice .",
    "this field profile leads to a novel electronic structure markedly different from uniform pseudo - magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "there are various ways in which periodic pseudo - magnetic fields can arise , one prominent way being a strain superlattice in graphene or tci .",
    "such spatially periodic strain fields are particularly relevant , as they were experimentally found to develop at interfaces of heterostructures built from tcis ( e.g. , snte ) and trivial insulators ( e.g. , pbte )  @xcite . at these interfaces ,",
    "the lattice constant mismatch causes dislocations which self - organize into a periodic array and therefore produce a natural realization of periodic strain fields .",
    "the key characteristic of the corresponding periodic pseudo - magnetic fields is that they can exist over macroscopic regions .",
    "in contrast , uniform pseudo - magnetic fields can not exist in the thermodynamic limit , owing to the boundedness of strain ( = pseudo - gauge field )  @xcite , unlike a real magnetic field .",
    "apart from strain superlattices , periodic pseudo - magnetic fields can arise as a result of incommensurate electrostatic potentials originating from , for instance , from lattice - mismatched substrates with a twist angle  @xcite . starting from the strain - induced pseudo - magnetic superlattice",
    ", we address the effect of electron - electron interactions .",
    "spatially alternating pseudo - magnetic fields change the low - energy electronic structure close to the dirac points .",
    "most strikingly , the energy - momentum dispersion in the vicinity of _ each _ dirac point becomes nearly flat , leading to a segment of flat band with a _ twofold _ degeneracy .",
    "these flat bands arise from the zeroth pll in regions with strong pseudo - magnetic fields ; and the twofold degeneracy corresponds to landau orbitals that reside in different spatial regions of opposite fields and have opposite dirac spinor components  @xcite , a novel feature that is absent in the case of uniform magnetic fields . counting the two valleys , the flat bands have fourfold degeneracy .",
    "the presence of flat bands leads to a diverging density of states , in contrast to the vanishing density of states at the dirac point of massless dirac fermions .",
    "consequently , periodic strain fields provide a feasible and effective way of engineering density of states , i.e. , electronic compressibility , at zero energy .    at charge neutrality ,",
    "the degenerate flat bands are mainly responsible for driving the spontaneous formation of ordered states .",
    "we discuss the various possibilities for degeneracy lifting in the flat band and discriminate between energetically favorable and unfavorable states .",
    "two prominent candidate ordered states are the charge - ordered state , where charge is redistributed from the region of positive ( negative ) to negative ( positive ) pseudo - magnetic field , and the valley - ordered state , where in each spatial region the valley degeneracy is lifted .",
    "we show that the valley - ordered state in graphene and tcis spontaneously breaks time - reversal symmetry and realizes an integer quantum hall effect similar to the haldane state  @xcite , but with the important difference of being driven by electron interactions without any external time - reversal - breaking field .",
    "we determine the mean - field ground state by self - consistently solving the full gap equation of interacting dirac fermions under a periodically alternating pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "the continuum hamiltonian is microscopically implemented using a lattice model with a strain superlattice .",
    "our analysis shows that the support of the flat band wavefunctions is of great importance .",
    "flat bands in any spatial region only have a twofold valley degeneracy , protected by the time reversal symmetry . therefore lifting this degeneracy by interactions implies time reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "for this reason , we find the valley - ordered quantum hall state is greatly favored over the charged - ordered state under generic forms of electron interactions .",
    "we show that the order parameters corresponding to the ordered states follow the strain profile , highlighting the crucial role of the pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "the present setup for a spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking quantum hall state relying on a strain - induced flat band should be contrasted with the proposed haldane mass generation for interacting massless dirac fermions in graphene  @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalization and dmrg studies  @xcite seem to have failed to find the interaction - driven haldane phase in models so far proposed , in contradiction to hartree - fock results .",
    "it is believed that the absence of the haldane phase in ed and dmrg phase diagrams stems from the vanishing density of states at the dirac point , and the resulting absence of a weak - coupling instability .",
    "in contrast , the quantum hall state in our setup already occurs spontaneously at weak coupling , owing to the strain - induced flat band .",
    "we set out to study the coupling of time - reversal invariant pseudo - gauge fields to dirac electrons . with two specific realizations in mind , graphene and tci surface states , we focus on dirac electrons in two dimensions .",
    "let us start by stating the essential features of dirac electrons coupled to pseudo - gauge fields , independent of specific context .",
    "any two dimensional system respecting time - reversal invariance and having dirac fermions not pinned to a particular time - reversal invariant momentum , will consist of two species of dirac fermions .",
    "labeling the two species by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the dirac hamiltonian describing the two species takes the general form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a set of pauli matrices acting on the pseudospin degree of freedom of the dirac fermions .",
    "time - reversal symmetry relates the two species by exchanging @xmath7 .",
    "pseudo - gauge fields couple to the dirac fermions in a manner similar to real electromagnetic gauge fields , with one crucial difference , however . in order to respect time - reversal invariance",
    ", the pseudo - gauge field must couple to the fermions in such a way that the two species see opposite fields . as a result ,",
    "in the presence of a pseudo - gauge field given by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , the dirac hamiltonian becomes @xmath10 this hamiltonian ( with @xmath11 ) describes the generic dirac electrons coupled to pseudo - gauge fields .",
    "pseudo - landau level quantization will occur when the gauge field @xmath8 acquires spatial dependence , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the interpretation of the dirac fermion pseudospin and valley degrees of freedom will depend on the particular realization of pseudo - magnetic field coupling in a given material . in this work",
    "we will discuss two examples of low - energy dirac electrons coupled to time - reversal invariant gauge fields , which we introduce in the remainder of this section .",
    "first we consider the case of graphene , and then we consider surface states of tcis . whereas in graphene the dirac pseudospin degree of freedom derives from the two sublattices  @xcite , the pseudospin of the tci surface state is more complicated due to intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , as we will discuss below.importantly , in case of the latter , spin - orbit coupling leads to spin - momentum locking in the surface state dirac theory .    in both cases , graphene and tci",
    ", the emphasis will be on strain - induced pseudo - magnetic field coupling .",
    "however , we will use the case of graphene to point out that pseudo - magnetic fields can have a physical origin different from strain , giving way to an even wider application of our results .",
    "the low - energy theory of graphene at charge neutrality is one of the hallmark examples of a @xmath13 dirac theory  @xcite .",
    "the two species of nodal dirac fermions are located at the two inequivalent bz corners , i.e. , the dirac points or valleys , and are labeled by @xmath14 and @xmath15 corresponding to the momenta @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian is obtained by expanding the band structure around the dirac points @xmath18 and @xmath19 in small momenta @xmath20 relative to the dirac points  @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) .",
    "the set of pauli matrices @xmath6 acts on the sublattice degree of freedom ( @xmath23/@xmath24 ) and the set of matrices @xmath25 acts on the valley degree of freedom ( @xmath14/@xmath15 ) .",
    "in addition , we have defined the dirac matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian acts on the dirac spinor @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 note that we choose the basis so that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 lattice are exchanged in the @xmath15 valley , meaning that we are working in the chiral representation ( i.e. , @xmath30 for valley @xmath31 ) .",
    "starting from the low - energy dirac hamiltonian of eq .  , we introduce a generalized time - reversal invariant pseudo - gauge field by coupling the dirac fermions to the field @xmath32 which consists of three components @xmath33 .",
    "the coupling to the fermions has the same form as ordinary minimal coupling , but with different gauge charges @xmath34 expressed as @xmath35 the gauge charge matrices @xmath34 encode the distinct nature of the pseudo - gauge field as compared to the ordinary gauge field , and are given by @xmath36 .",
    "the third gauge charge matrix @xmath37 is diagonal in valley space and assigns opposite sign to the two valleys .",
    "therefore , the component @xmath38 realizes the general hamiltonian of eq .   in graphene .",
    "in graphene , this is the pseudo - gauge field component that arises in the presence of strain and plays a central role in this work .",
    "the presence of a field @xmath39 coupling to @xmath40 leads to a moving of the dirac points away from @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in opposite directions .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] ( left ) , where the bold blue dots denote the dirac points moving towards the zone center .    the following properties of the gauge field charges will be important for our analysis .",
    "the charges @xmath34 realize a pseudospin @xmath41 algebra , expressed as @xmath42 = 2 i \\epsilon^{ijk } \\omega^k$ ] .",
    "the matrices @xmath34 commute with the hamiltonian in the absence of fields , and as a consequence generate a continuous @xmath41 symmetry of the low - energy graphene hamiltonian .",
    "this symmetry is broken when mass terms are introduced to the hamiltonian , i.e. , when the dirac electrons are gapped out .",
    "in particular , the set of mass matrices @xmath43 describes masses that anti - commute with the hamiltonian and between themselves .",
    "they constitute a set of compatible masses , the physical nature of which is well - known .",
    "specifically , the mass @xmath44 corresponds to an electrostatic potential making the two honeycomb sublattices inequivalent and breaking inversion symmetry .",
    "such term is diagonal in valley - space , i.e. , it does not couple the two dirac points .",
    "the other two masses , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are off - diagonal in valley space , are known as kekul masses and correspond to modulations of the tight - binding nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath47 with tripled unit cell  @xcite .",
    "the breaking of translational invariance and the modulations over small distances ( large momenta ) couple the dirac points .",
    "the gauge charges @xmath34 act as generators of rotations within the space of masses , which follows from the commutation relation @xmath48 = 2 i \\epsilon^{ijk } \\gamma_k$ ] .",
    "in addition to the mass terms @xmath49 , there is a mass term @xmath50 , the time - reversal odd haldane mass  @xcite , which anti - commutes with the hamiltonian  , but commutes with both the @xmath51 and the @xmath34 .",
    "hence , whereas @xmath49 is a vector under the transformations generated by @xmath34 , @xmath50 is a scalar .",
    "the two remaining gauge charges @xmath52 and @xmath53 are off - diagonal in valley space but diagonal in sublattice space .",
    "the former implies translational symmetry breaking and the latter implies that these terms arise due to charge density modulations .",
    "consequently , charge density waves ( cdws ) with a six - site unit cell , which we will refer to as valley - coupling cdws , lead to a pseudo - gauge coupling in the same way as strain  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41 structure of the gauge charges @xmath34 implies that within the low - energy theory , the pseudo - gauge field components are unitarily equivalent to each other .",
    "topological insulator materials are bulk insulators hosting gapless dirac fermions at their surfaces  @xcite .",

    "the surface state dirac hamiltonian at @xmath55 , given by the terms that respect the crystal symmetries leaving @xmath55 invariant , reads @xmath59 and a similar expression can be derived for @xmath56 .",
    "here @xmath60 is a set of pauli matrices that represents a kramers doublet , and @xmath25 is a valley degree of freedom corresponding to the two inequivalent bulk @xmath61-points mapped onto @xmath55 .",
    "the momentum @xmath20 is measured with respect to @xmath55 ; the spin - momentum locking shown in hamiltonian   ( i.e. , first two terms ) comes from spin - orbit coupling . for @xmath62",
    "there are two degenerate kramer s doublets at @xmath55 , which are split in energy by finite @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "most importantly , finite @xmath63 and @xmath64 leads to the appearance of two species low - energy dirac points , which are located at @xmath65 , measured from @xmath55 .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .   can be projected into the subspace corresponding to @xmath66 to obtain the effective low - energy dirac theory .",
    "this yields  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the effective pseudospin degree of freedom , @xmath20 is now measured with respect to @xmath66 , and @xmath69 .",
    "note that in the chosen basis the hamiltonian is valley - isotropic , taking @xmath70 as an effective valley degree of freedom .    with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "we have arrived at a desciption of the low - energy dirac fermions that has the general form introduced in the beginning of this section , and is thus similar to the graphene hamiltonian of eq .  .",
    "hence , in a way analogous to graphene , we can use symmetry arguments to establish the effect of various perturbations .",
    "for instance , since the tci surface states are protected by mirror symmetry , one expects mirror symmetry breaking to open up a gap .",
    "we find two such gap opening mass terms , which do not couple the low - energy valleys , and they are given in the basis of   as @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the mass term @xmath72 breaks time - reversal symmetry and originates from the terms @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the basis of eq .  .",
    "the mass gap originating from @xmath72 is equivalent to the graphene haldane gap , and consequently corresponds to a qah phase  @xcite .",
    "similarly , by using symmetry arguments , the time - reversal invariant pseudo - gauge field couplings can be identified . as a consequence of the low symmetry of the @xmath55 point ,",
    "there are no two dimensional representations which directly imply pseudo - gauge coupling . however , since the symmetric terms @xmath76 and @xmath77 displace the dirac points in momentum space , any perturbation coupling to them , will have the effect of a pseudo - gauge field . looking for other terms both even under time - reversal and inversion ( as expected for strain ) , one finds another dirac bilinear given by @xmath78 .",
    "we will show in the next section , when we discuss strain and strain superlattices , that components of the strain tensor couple to these terms .",
    "the effect of these terms is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] ( right ) , where bold blue and red dots denote the dirac points in the vicinity of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , shifting towards the zone center as a result of strain .",
    "in the previous section we introduced pseudo - gauge field coupling in the context of graphene and tci surface states , and argued that strain realizes such coupling .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed discussion of strain , and more specifically _ periodic _ pseudo - magnetic fields arising due to periodically varying strain , i.e. , a strain superlattice .",
    "elastic deformations of the crystal lattice , i.e. , strain fields , are described by the strain tensor @xmath79 given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the displacement field . given the symmetry of the crystal lattice",
    ", the strain tensor can be decomposed into components transforming as distinct representations of the symmetry group . from this decomposition",
    "one can read off which lattice deformations couple as ( pseudo-)gauge fields to the dirac fermions .        in case of hexagonal symmetry , applicable to graphene , there are two @xmath83-wave strain components @xmath84 , which couple to the dirac fermions as the valley - diagonal field @xmath85 of eq .",
    "( let us omit the label @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 , for the moment )  @xcite .",

    "we will establish a detailed connection between landau level physics and periodic strain in the next section . a key feature",
    "we wish to stress here , is that the formation of the zero - energy flat band , the degeneracy of which is related to the strength of the pseudo - magnetic field , leads to a finite and considerable density of states ( dos ) at the charge neutrality point . in stark constrast , in the unstrained case",

    "understanding the spectral effect of these dirac fermion bilinears on the zeroth pll gives a first idea of the ways in which their spontaneous formation can lower the energy for charge neutral systems . for a more refined understanding of the energetics it is necessary to consider the effect of perturbations on higher plls ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) .",
    "for both the cdw term @xmath150 and the haldane term @xmath50 all plls with @xmath141 get pushed up or down in energy depending on whether they have energies @xmath164 , i.e. positive ( negative ) solutions get pushed up ( down ) .",

    "schematically this field arrangement is shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : pll ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : pll ] shows how we can think of the a periodically alternating field as a strain superlattice with effective `` two - site '' unit cell ( i.e. , positive and negative field ) , reminiscent of an antiferromagnet , leading to a doubling of the pll degeneracies .",

    "[ fig : pll ] is the valley - ordered quantum hall ( or haldane ) state . in such state",
    "the zero modes corresponding to an `` up '' pseudo - magnetic field are occupied .",
    "note that this implies an alternating occupation of valleys @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pll ] .",

    "black arrows explicitly indicate which @xmath147 corresponds to which @xmath166 profile .",

    "this is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] where two pseudo - magnetic landau - like orbitals are localized on the @xmath23-sublattice ( lower right ) and two localized on the @xmath24-sublattice .",

    "[ fig : spec1 ] lower left ) `` zero modes '' are localized on the @xmath23-sublattice , and on the @xmath24-sublattice in the region of negative field .",
    "in addition , we observe that for @xmath147 moving away from @xmath144 ( following the blue arrow ) the two landau orbitals in each region move away from the position of maximum field towards the position of vanishing field .",
    "in particular , they move away in opposite directions , which is a direct consequence of their different valley index .",
    "as the two valleys effective see opposite fields , and the spatial position of a landau orbital is given by @xmath169 , the landau orbitals are expected to spatially move in opposite directions . with increasing @xmath147 ( @xmath170 ) landau orbitals of different spatial regions and the same valley start to overlap , eventually leading to the splitting observed in spectrum indicated by the most right black arrow in the upper left panel of fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : specgaps](e ) and  [ fig : specgaps](f ) show the spectrum obtained in the presence of valley - coupling cdws , which we have discussed split the continuum @xmath139 pll in a way similar to the haldane term .",
    "we observe that in case of a strain superlattice , the cdws do not lead to a full gap , but only lift the degeneracy of the flat band states localized at the position where the pseudo - magnetic field has its extrema .",

    "note also that the spectrum numerically obtained numerically shows both split and shifted higher ( @xmath172 ) plls .    from this analysis",
    "we conclude that in the presence of the strain superlattice , the low - energy electronic structure can be approximated by sets of plls for the two distinct regions of the superlattice unit cell .",
    "in addition , based on their effect on the degenerate low - energy plls , we expect the charge - ordered and anti - ferro - valley - ordered states to be the dominant instabilities in the presence of the pseudo - magnetic field superlattice .",
    "we end this section with two remarks .",
    "first , we note that the analysis presented here is based on the the assumption of a strain - induced pseudo - magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath173 in eq .  .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec:2ddirac ] , a unitary matrix can rotate to another component , e.g. @xmath174 or @xmath175 .",
    "this is does not change the ( low - energy ) spectrum , but it does change the nature of the eigenstates .",
    "in addition , it also changes the nature of the perturbations , since the unitary matrix rotates within the space of masses represented by @xmath49 as well .",
    "in particular , this implies that a sublattice polarized term @xmath150 will be rotated into one of the kekule terms .",
    "interestingly , the haldane term is a scalar under these unitary rotations and hence is invariant .",
    "to summarize , the analysis of this section still applies , but in a rotated basis .",
    "the second remark concerns the applicability of our analysis to tci surface states .",
    "the arguments put forward in the present section build on the specific example of graphene pll physics . they remain valid in the context of tci surface states .",
    "most importantly , in the presence of a uniform pseudo - magnetic field , the tci surface @xmath139 plls are localized on the tci pseudospin degree of freedom in such a way that the time - reversal invariant ferroelectric distortion of the crystal lattice only shifts them , whereas a time - reversal breaking zeeman - type spin - coupling splits them in energy . as a result , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the valley - ordered quantum hall state and charge - ordered state in graphene , and zeeman term and ferroelectric distortion of tci surface states .",
    "in order to systematically investigate the patterns of symmetry breaking and pll splitting , as a consequence of interacting flat band electron , we have studied an interacting hamiltonian on the graphene honeycomb lattice and performed extensive self - consistent hartree fock calculations .",
    "we report the results in this section .    based on the intuitive picture of the plls in the two spatially separated regions we anticipate both the formation of a charge - ordered state with ferroelectric polarization , corresponding to a redistribution of charge between the regions of positive and negative pseudo - magnetic field , and the formation of a valley - ordered quantum hall ground state .",
    "interactions which may lead to the formation of these states in a graphene lattice model are the nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) density - density interactions  @xcite , respectively , as will be demonstrated below .",
    "we therefore consider the interacting hamiltonian @xmath176 where the interacting part @xmath177 is given by @xmath178 here @xmath179 is the nn interaction strength and @xmath180 the nnn interaction strength , and @xmath181 is the number operator at site @xmath182 .",

    "interactions between electrons in continuum plls are expected to lead to the formation of polarized states splitting the degeneracies of plls .",
    "we have investigated pll polarization for the case of lattice plls corresponding to periodic pseudo - magnetic fields .",
    "two polarized states were shown to fully lift the zero energy flat band degeneracy while at the same time pushing all occupied ( unoccupied ) lattice plls down ( up ) .",
    "the first state is the sublattice polarized charge - ordered state , which can be pictured as a spatially polarized state with all plls of the positive ( or negative ) field region occupied .",
    "the second is the anti - ferro - valley ordered state , or spontaneous quantum hall state , for which all pll states effectively seeing a positive ( or negative ) field are occupied , implying time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "we found that other polarized states , even though they have similar characteristics in the continuum , do not fully lift the lattice flat band pll degeneracies .    using self - consistent hartree - fock calculations",
    "we have studied an interacting honeycom lattice model with periodic strain - induced lattice plls .",
    "our results demonstrate that the strain - induced reconstruction of low - energy elecronic structure , in particular the presence of a zero energy flat band , determines the impact of interactions .",
    "three key results highlight this conclusion .",
    "first , the mean - field order parameters clearly reflect the periodicity of the pseudo - magnetic field , showing that the amplitude of the order parameter is tied to the strength of pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "second , as a consequence of the characteristic wavefunction support of the flat band single - particle states , the effect of interactions that favor time - reversal invariant pseudo - spin order is suppressed .",
    "this effectively enhances interactions that favor time - reversal symmetry breaking valley order with associated spontaneous quantum hall effect .",
    "we have established this result in the context of the graphene lattice model , where the pseudo - spin corresponds to the sublattice degree of freedom .",
    "the nn interactions are inter - sublattice interactions , and therefore supressed , as the flat band single - particle states have support on one of the sublattices only , in each positive or negative field region .",
    "the result , however , is general and applies equally to tci surface states .",
    "the physical interpretation of pseudo - spin and valley are different , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec:2ddirac ] , yet the effect of interactions favoring time - reversal symmetry breaking remains strongly enhanced .",
    "third , the valley - ordered spontaneous quantum hall state already occurs for small interactions when the plls are well - developed .",
    "the pll structure is a way to significantly enhance density of states near the charge neutral point .",
    "we conclude that in the presence of periodic strain and interactions , a system of unpinned dirac electrons has a generic instability towards a spontaneous quantum hall phase .",
    "the emphasis of the numerical calculations we report , has been on spinless electrons in graphene . in tci surface states , however , no additional spin degeneracy is present . due to spin - orbit coupling",
    "the electron spin is an intrisinc part of the low - energy dirac structure . in particular",
    ", this implies that there are no purely spin - polarized phases , such as the global anti - ferromagnet , competing with the spontaneous quantum hall phase , favoring the latter as ground state .    whereas uniform strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields suffer from implementation limitations , particularly beyond the nano - scale , periodic strain",
    "can potentially be realized in macroscopic sample sizes .",
    "in fact , such periodic strain fields and induced pseudo - magnetic fields were demonstrated in tci heterostructure  @xcite , making tci surface states the prime candidate to exhibit spontaneous formation of nontrivial electronic states .",

    "for the purpose of being selfcontained we collect some standard results of dirac fermions in a constant magnetic field in this appendix .",
    "these may be directly applied to the case of time - reversal invariant pseudo - magnetic fields , bearing in mind the key characteristic of opposite sign of the pseudo - magnetic field in the two valleys .    in the presence of a magnetic field",

    "note that the definition of these operators depends on the sign of the @xmath24-field , which is a direct consequence of eq .  .",
    "we note in passing that all of the above did not require specifying a gauge for @xmath273 .",
    "the landau level spectrum of a dirac hamiltonian of the form @xmath274 is then straightforwardly obtained by making the substitution @xmath275 . squaring the hamiltonian yields @xmath276\\gamma_x\\gamma_y",

    "one therefore obtains the landau level energies @xmath282 each of the @xmath283 is two - fold degenerate because of the valley degree of freedom , in addition to an @xmath284 degeneracy where @xmath23 is the area of the system .",
    "we find the corresponding eigenstates by taking a closer look at the explicit expression for the hamiltonian in each valley .",
    "writing @xmath285 for the hamiltonian in valley @xmath286 we have @xmath287 the eigenstates belonging to the eigenvalues @xmath283 of eq .",

    ".   reveals that these states are given in each of the valleys as @xmath293 we stress that this implies the zero modes are localized on _ opposite _ sublattices for the two valleys , as we had exchanged sublattices for the @xmath294 valley .",
    "we proceed to consider the effect of symmetry breaking terms on the landau level spectrum . specifically , we consider first the set of time - reversal symmetry invariant masses @xmath295 which enter the hamiltonian as @xmath296 for small masses we may use perturbation theory to study the splitting or shifting of landau levels .",
    "it turns out however that the exact energies can be obtained in the presence of @xmath297 .",
    "the energies are found by squaring the hamiltonian @xmath298 , which gives @xmath276\\gamma_x\\gamma_y + m^2   \\\\",

    "we directly find the energies @xmath299 expanding the square root @xmath300 in small @xmath301 yields the same result as second order perturbation theory .",

    "such transformation block diagonalizes the hamiltonian and we obtain the energies in a more direct way . in particular",
    ", we can employ the unitary rotation to find the energies of the zero modes for the case of massive dirac fermions . in the rotated basis we can construct zero mode states in the same way as before , which will have energies @xmath305 where @xmath286 represents the valley degree of freedom .",
    "we conclude by taking into account the time - reversal symmetry breaking but chiral symmetry preserving mass @xmath306 entering as @xmath307 . since such this term is a scalar under chiral rotations generated by @xmath34 we may consider @xmath308 and use the chiral rotation @xmath121 to block diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
