    "from the discovery of the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0@xcite , a lot of theoretical and experimental researches have been performed in order to reveal the mechanism of the really high superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath6 ) in metals and find a route to a new superconductor with much higher @xmath6 .",
    "it has been indicated that mgb@xmath0 is a phonon - mediated bcs s - wave superconductor by theoretical calculations@xcite , the nmr study@xcite and the high - resolution photoemission study@xcite , then detailed phonon dispersion is calculated@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "multiple superconducting gaps are also indicated by the specific heat measurement@xcite , the tunneling spectroscopy study@xcite and the high - resolution photoemission study@xcite . in the electron doped system mg@xmath3al@xmath4b@xmath0 ,",
    "the structural instabilityhas been observed around @xmath7 10% , resulting in the loss of superconductivity.@xcite    in this paper , the fermi surface property in mgb@xmath0 is theoretically obtained for the further microscopic measurements of single crystals .",
    "the bandstructures for iso - electronic compounds libc and mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 are calculated for the comparison .",
    "total energy calculations for mg@xmath3al@xmath4b@xmath0 are performed to clarify the structural instability .",
    "band structure calculations are carried out by using a full potential apw ( flapw ) method with the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange correlation potential .",
    "for the lda , the formula proposed by gunnarsson and lundqvist@xcite is used . for the band structure calculation",
    ", we used the program codes ; tspace@xcite and kansai-99 .",
    "we used in the calculations the experimentally observed lattice constants : * a*= 3.083  and * c*=3.527  for mgb@xmath8 .",
    "muffin - tin ( mt ) radii are set as 0.4979 * a * and 0.2742 * a * for mg and b , respectively .",
    "core electrons ( ne - core for mg , he - core for b ) are calculated inside the mt spheres in each self - consistent step .",
    "the lapw basis functions are truncated at @xmath9 , corresponding to 225 lapw functions at the @xmath10 point .",
    "the sampling points are uniformly distributed in the irreducible 1/24 th of the brillouin zone , 333 * k*-points ( divided by 12 , 12 , 12 ) for both the potential convergence and the final band structure .",
    "the similar parameters are used in calculations for libc and mg@xmath3al@xmath4b@xmath0 .",
    "mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 crystallizes in a base centered orthorhombic structure containing 8 formula units in the primitive unit cell . in this case , calculations are performed by using about 1,600 lapw basis functions at the uniformly distributed 39 * k*-points for the potential convergence and 369 * k*-points ( divided by 8 , 8 , 8) for the final band structure in the irreducible 1/8 th of the brillouin zone .",
    "the calculated energy bandstructure and the density of states are shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2band ] and fig .",
    "[ mgb2dos ] , respectively .",
    "they are very similar to the previous calculations@xcite , though fig .",
    "[ mgb2band ] shows bandstructures along all the symmetry axes ; the @xmath10-k - m-@xmath10 lines is parallel to the a - h - l - a lines on the basal plane and the @xmath11 , u and p axes are along the c - axis ( see fig .",
    "[ mgb2fermi ] ( a ) ) .",
    "let us see the dispersion along the p axis ; the dispersive band crossing the fermi level . the band is originated from b-@xmath12(@xmath1 ) band and doubly degenerated .",
    "these b-@xmath12(@xmath1 ) states are non - bonding along the p axis within the honeycomb lattice , and anti - bonding ( bonding ) at the k ( h ) point for the inter - layer ( along the c - axis ) mixing . while b-@xmath13(@xmath2 ) states are split to bonding and anti - bonding sates within the honeycomb lattice , then the top of the bonding states are located just above the fermi level along the @xmath11 axis . while the bottom of the anti - bonding bands are located around 1.1 ry .",
    "the energy and its components foe the states near the fermi level are listed in table  [ tablestates ] . eventually , there are four fermi surfaces ; two cylindrical hole fermi surfaces along the @xmath11 axis originating in the @xmath2 band , and from the @xmath1 bands one hole around the t axis one electron along s axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2fermi ] . the total number of holes and electrons are compensated .",
    "the unique characteristics in the bandstructure of mgb@xmath0 is the existence of the cylindrical @xmath2-holes ( fig .",
    "[ mgb2fermi ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the situation has been discussed as the relative shift of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 bands@xcite .",
    "in fact , the totally non - bonding @xmath2 states ( about 0.91 ry ) is much higher in energy than the non - bonding @xmath1 state ( 0.65 ry ; the mid - point on the p axis ) .",
    "it should be ascribed to the ionic mg@xmath14 strongly affecting the crystalline field for the b-@xmath15 states . moreover , here it is emphasized that the 3d network in the @xmath1 band is suggested by the dispersive band along the p axis .",
    "as was already discussed@xcite , graphite ( primitive graphite c@xmath0 ) shows a 2d bandstructure . in graphite , the inter - layer distance ( @xmath163.348 ) is smaller than in mgb@xmath0 ( @xmath163.528 ) , but the planar bond length ( @xmath171.418  ) is much smaller than in mgb@xmath0 ( @xmath171.780  ) . the planar bond length determines the total band width in each case , because of the much smaller distance and more coordination in plane , though it depends on how extended the wave functions are . as a result , the valence band width is narrower in mgb@xmath0 than graphite .",
    "however , what should be noticed here is the ratio of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which is 2.36 in graphite and 1.98 in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the much smaller ratio in mgb@xmath0 causes more 3d feature , resulting in the dispersive @xmath1 band along the p axis , which obtains both the hole and electron fermi surfaces .",
    "the @xmath2 bands keep the 2d character , because the @xmath13 orbitals are extended in a layer .",
    "eventually , the strong 3d feature in low - lying @xmath1 bands brings about 2d fermi surface of the @xmath2 band in mgb@xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2fermi ] .",
    "the 3d feature and the low - lying in @xmath1 bands are ascribed to the existence of mg@xmath14 ion .",
    "the calculated specific heat coefficient @xmath20 is 1.73 mj / mol k@xmath21 , while the experimental value @xmath22 is 2.6 mj / mol k@xmath21.@xcite therefore , the averaged electron - phonon mass enhancement factor @xmath23 is derived as 0.50 from @xmath24 .",
    "the calculated angular dependence of the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) frequencies are shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2dhva ] .",
    "the dhva frequencies and the cyclotron masses are summarized in table  [ tabledhva ] .",
    "several theoretical studies have pointed out the importance of electron - phonon coupling in the @xmath2 band for the superconductivity , then the superconducting gap in mgb@xmath0 can be expected to be larger on the @xmath2 fermi surfaces than on the @xmath1 fermi surfaces .",
    "it is also expected to be larger mass enhancement in the cyclotron masses in the @xmath2 fermi surfaces , though they have not yet observed so far , unfortunately .",
    "recently mgb@xmath0 single crystals are grown by a several groups,@xcite then the dhva oscillations is expected to be detected soon .",
    "the experimentally observed cyclotron masses will be the direct evidence for the two superconducting gaps in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "it is worth to see bandstructures of the related compounds .",
    "libc and mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 are iso - electric compounds with mgb@xmath0 , though the crystal structure is slightly different.@xcite libc can be obtained , if mg and one of b in mgb@xmath0 are replaced by li and c. the stacking along the c - direction has not been experimentally determined , so we assume b - b - b ...",
    "(c - c - c ... ) stacking .",
    "mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 crystallizes in a orthorhombic structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2c2crys ] , in which there are a distorted b - c honeycomb lattice layer and a mg layer . in libc , @xmath163.53  , @xmath171.59   and @xmath252.22 .",
    "while , in mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 , @xmath163.74  , @xmath171.58   in average and @xmath252.37 . therefore , both compounds are expected to be less 3d than mgb@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ libcband ] shows the bandstructure for libc .",
    "the space group of libc is p6@xmath262 , then the degeneracy along the p - axis is lifted .",
    "li@xmath27 ion has less attractive for the @xmath1 bands , then the bonding @xmath2 bands get under the fermi level . eventually , there are hole and electron fermi surfaces both from the @xmath1 bands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ libcfermi ] .",
    "more interesting bandstructure is found in mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2c2band ] , mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 becomes a semiconductor in consistent with the measured conductivity.@xcite the opening the gap may be due to the less anisotropic hybridyzation in the lower symmetry . however , the dispersion of top of the valence bands are very flat along the @xmath11 axis , which is similar to the @xmath2 bands in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "cylindrical fermi surface , which is relevant in the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , can be obtained with hole doping .",
    "with substituting al for mg in mgb@xmath0 , the superconducting transition temperature gradually decreases and structural instability appears with al content from 10 % to 20%.@xcite after the instability , the superconducting transition temperature rapidly decreases .",
    "partial al substitution for mg means electron doping to the mgb@xmath0 bandstructure , leading to vanishing @xmath2 hole fermi surfaces .",
    "one can expect the structural phase instability is related to the disappearance of the @xmath2 hole .    to reveal the structural instability ,",
    "the total energy calculations with a several concentration and the lattice constant are performed . in the calculations ,",
    "the lattice constant * a * is assumed to be constant , as its small al concentration dependence ( * a*=3.083  in mgb@xmath0 to 3.006   in alb@xmath0 ) and the virtual lattice approximation is adopted , in which the atom with the atomic number of @xmath29 is used for the case of al concentration @xmath7 .",
    "the total energies are obtained at the points in fig .",
    "[ mgalb2 ] , then the optimized lattice constant * c * for each concentration @xmath7 are determined by using parabolic fitting .",
    "the total energy as a function of * c * is well reproduced as a parabolic function , so that the present calculations can not predict the observed structural instability for any al concentration .",
    "there is another structural instability reported around @xmath570% , where the superconductivity disappears.@xcite nevertheless the optimized * c * decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath7 , as in fig .",
    "[ mgalb2 ] . concerning that aluminum ordering",
    "is observed for @xmath30@xcite , the virtual lattice approximation may not be applied to the system mg@xmath3al@xmath28b@xmath0 .    for alb@xmath0 , with using the measured * a*=3.006 , the optimized * c *",
    "is successfully obtained as 3.245  for the experimental value 3.251 . with the value * a*=3.083  for mgb@xmath0 , which is used in fig .",
    "[ mgalb2 ] , * c*=3.241  for alb@xmath0 . in each case , the error is less than about 0.3% for alb@xmath0 .",
    "however , for mgb@xmath0 , the optimized * c * is 3.457 which is 2% smaller than the measured value 3.527 .",
    "the lattice constants decrease in low temperatures , but * c * is reported as 3.51504(4)  at 15k , which is only 0.3 % smaller than in room temperature.@xcite this 2% error should make some sense and corresponds to the jumps of two discontinuities ( structural instabilities ) around 20% and 70% al concentration . the larger inter - layer distance ( * c * ) could decrease the number of the @xmath2 holes . therefore there may exist some mechanism beyond the lda that favours the small number of the @xmath2 holes and is related to the superconductivity .",
    "this should be solved in the future .",
