    "the unexpected discovery of high-@xmath0 itinerant ferromagnetism in doped hexaborides@xcite  has re - ignited interest in the problem of excitonic ordering near the semiconductor ",
    "metal transition.@xcite  excitonically ordered states are characterized by an off - diagonal order parameter describing pairing between conduction electrons and valence holes . early theoretical work by volkov _ et .",
    "al._@xcite  anticipated the emergence of ferromagnetism on doping such an excitonic state .",
    "these authors considered the limit of nearly nested overlapping conduction and valence bands with _ weak _ repulsive electron - electron interactions . in this limit",
    ", the problem can be approximately cast into a form nearly identical to bcs theory , and studied using the techniques of mean - field theory .",
    "although this work ( and some subsequent recent studies@xcite ) suffers from the important physical mistake of neglecting the instability to phase separation , ferromagnetism remains nevertheless a generic feature in a corrected treatment.@xcite     while the appearance of ferromagnetism in the weak - coupling limit is encouraging , it is far from a conclusive and complete theoretical explanation for the experiments .",
    "first , coulomb interactions in the hexaborides are not particularly weak , and most likely are comparable to the fermi energy and band overlap .",
    "second , the above explanation appears to hinge on the first - order nature of the excitonic to normal ( e - n ) transition in the bcs limit .",
    "while this feature , mathematically analogous to the first - order transition to the normal state due to pair - breaking by an external zeeman field in a superconductor,@xcite  is present in the nested mean - field limit , there do not appear to be any general theoretical grounds mandating this behavior more generally .",
    "moreover , the universality of the experimental results , now observed in a large number of different compounds ( ca@xmath1la@xmath2b@xmath3 , bab@xmath3 , ca@xmath1ce@xmath2b@xmath3 , srb@xmath3, ",
    ")@xcite , argues for the robustness of the phenomenon .    to determine whether excitonic ferromagnetism is indeed more general than its weak - coupling theoretical basis , we consider here the completely opposite _ strong - coupling _ regime",
    "this is not expected to be directly applicable to the hexaborides , as these materials are most likely best described by an intermediate - coupling model .",
    "nevertheless , many useful insights are gained from this complementary limit . as usual , the principle assumption of the strong - coupling limit is the dominance of potential over kinetic energy .",
    "this is achieved concretely using a tight - binding model ( see eqs .  [ tb1]-[nnn ] , in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) , in which the conduction and valence bands of the conventional continuum theories are replaced by localized @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the analog of band gap in the continuum model is the level splitting @xmath6 .",
    "the order parameter characterizing excitonic ordering is then a matrix in spin space : @xmath7 where @xmath8 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 in the @xmath4 orbital , and @xmath10 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath11 in the @xmath5 orbital .",
    "excitonically ordered states thus have some partial occupation of the nominally excited @xmath4 states , as a result of coulombic repulsion . in general , @xmath12 is a proper order parameter ( i.e. one which characterizes a spontaneously broken symmetry ) if the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals have different symmetries . in this paper",
    ", we consider a `` minimal model '' with this property , comprised of one @xmath4 and one @xmath5 orbital per unit cell  see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbs ] .",
    "this mimics the situation in the hexaborides , for which the conduction and valence states also transform as different representations of the cubic point group@xcite . because of complications arising from orbital degeneracy , however , the appropriate representations for the hexaborides are three - dimensional rather than scalar .",
    "we defer the possible complications arising from these additional degrees of freedom to a future investigation .     and @xmath13 orbitals , respectively.,width=192 ]    as for the more familiar hubbard model ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the problem simplifies somewhat in the strong - coupling limit . considering first the undoped system ( half - filled = two electrons per unit cell )",
    ", we obtain a novel quantum pseudo - spin model ( eqs .  [ tj1]-[ising ] , sec .",
    "[ sec : undoped ] ) . within this model ,",
    "the excitonic insulator ( ei ) appears as an intermediate state separating not a metal and a semiconductor but a _ mott insulator _ and a semiconductor ( or band insulator ) . in some respects ,",
    "the behavior is argued to be quite similar to that of a quantum spin-@xmath14 xxz antiferromagnet in a magnetic field , with excitonic ordering analogous to xy antiferromagnetism .",
    "the `` spins '' of the model , however , can take on _ five _ distinct states per site : one singlet state with both electrons in the lower - energy @xmath5 orbital , and four different spin states with one @xmath4 and one @xmath5 electron .",
    "this is in contrast to the two states of a single spin-@xmath14 particle .    in the strong coupling limit , this large hilbert space is `` unified '' by several approximate symmetries valid at different energy scales . at the largest energy scales this is an enormous su(4 ) group , corresponding to arbitrary complex rotations of the four components of @xmath12 .",
    "the approximate su(4 ) symmetry fully unifies all possible excitonic states , including singlet , triplet , and singlet - triplet coexistences .",
    "these are described by the general decomposition @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the singlet and triplet order parameters , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 unit and pauli matrices in spin space , respectively . a system with approximate su(4 )",
    "invariance contains the germ of ferromagnetism , since several possible excitonic states ( those with non - zero @xmath21 and/or @xmath22 ) give rise to net exchange fields , and hence a magnetic moment .",
    "su(4 ) symmetry implies that these states are low in energy . at intermediate energies",
    "the su(4 ) symmetry reduces to an su(2)@xmath23su(2 ) invariance , which reflects separate spin rotations of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the latter is a symmetry of the conventional continuum models of eis , and transforms the order parameter in a `` chiral '' manner : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are su(2 ) matrices .",
    "finally , further weak interactions reduce this to a simple su(2)@xmath27 symmetry at the ( very ) lowest energies .",
    "these symmetry considerations underly the simple physical mechanism for ferromagnetism elucidated here@xcite .",
    "the dominant tendency imposed by coulomb interactions is to excitonic ordering . with approximate su(4 ) symmetry ,",
    "however , the `` orientation '' ( form of @xmath12 ) of the order parameter is nearly free and fixed only by weak `` anisotropy '' terms . in the undoped material , these anisotropies favor a simple paramagnetic triplet state .",
    "doping introduces additional exchange energy contributions that modify the anisotropy , causing @xmath12 to `` flop '' into a different orientation with a ferromagnetic moment . in the present model ,",
    "the excitonic order in the ferromagnet is of non - collinear triplet type , in which @xmath28 as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , in addition to ferromagnetic magnetization , this state has additional spatially - varying local static moments and spin currents transverse to the axis of net magnetization .",
    "the transition to this state from the paramagnet is generally first order , and therefore coincides with a jump in the electronic density .",
    "since experiments are performed at fixed charge density ( dictated by the concentration of dopant ions ) , the intermediate `` forbidden '' range of dopings can be accommodated only by phase separation . with long - range coulomb interactions",
    "included , macroscopic phase separation is impossible , and charge domain formation is expected , as pointed out already in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the _ detailed _ demonstration of this behavior with doping is non - trivial . as for many other strongly correlated systems ,",
    "the problem of doping is much more difficult than that of the stoichiometric mott insulator . indeed , as the ei state lies intermediate between band and mott insulators , doping the ei is a sort of interpolation between doping a conventional band insulator and doping an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the latter problem is of course at the crux of the physics of high - temperature superconductivity , so that perhaps the experimental and theoretical insights gained in the hexaborides will be helpful more generally . at any rate ,",
    "doping the ei can be shown by very simple arguments to favor ferromagnetism in strong coupling .",
    "essentially , the physics of this behavior is similar to the `` nagaoka effect''@xcite  in a doped antiferromagnet ",
    "ferromagnetic alignment of the excitonic order parameters allows for more coherent propagation of the doped electrons , and hence a lowering of their kinetic energy .",
    "this mechanism is actually _ stronger _ in the ei than in the antiferromagnet , because of the global _ coherence _ of the excitonic condensate , and the near degeneracy ( due to approximate su(4 ) symmetry ) of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states .",

    "the bi state is the band insulator .",
    "intermediate between the bi and af@xmath30 phases are the excitonic insulator ( ei ) and an insulator with coexisting excitonic and nel order ( ei / af ) .",
    "the fm , fm@xmath32 , pfm , and pfm@xmath32 phases are all ferromagnetic metals ( see table  [ tab : phases ]  for the differences between these states ) , while pm indicates a paramagnetic metallic phase .",
    "all the metallic states above exhibit excitonic order.,width=312 ]    to provide a concrete demonstration of these ideas , the strong coupling zero temperature phase diagram of the model is calculated in this paper using a `` free fermi gas '' approximation .",
    "this approximation captures the most important _ single quasiparticle _",

    "we consider a minimal model capable of exhibiting excitonic order , which contains two orbitals per unit cell , so as to give rise to two bands in a non - interacting limit ( the actual situation in the hexaborides is more complex , with orbital degeneracy leading to multiple electron and hole pockets ) .",
    "a strong - coupling limit is obtained by first considering only _ local _ interactions within a unit cell : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are electron annihilation operators for the `` conduction '' and `` valence '' states , respectively , obeying @xmath37 . here and throughout the paper , we use latin indices @xmath38 to denote the lattice site , and greek indices @xmath39 to denote the spin state .",

    "the parameters @xmath40,@xmath29,@xmath41,@xmath42 describe the `` band gap '' ( orbital energy difference ) , chemical potential , on - site `` hubbard '' repulsion , and nearest neighbor repulsion , respectively , within the unit cell .",
    "a crucial feature of @xmath43 is the absence of direct hopping between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals within the unit cell .",
    "for excitonic ordering to be well - defined , it is necessary at a minimum that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states be distinguished by a discrete symmetry operation , e.g. parity . when this is the case , direct hopping between these orbitals is prohibited",
    ". it may be helpful to imagine an artificial situation in which the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals represent @xmath44 and @xmath13 orbitals on a single site of a square lattice ( see fig .  [",

    "are orthogonal both on the same site and on nearest neighbor sites .",
    "an overlap _ is _ possible , though for next - nearest neighbor pairs , i.e. on a diagonal . in general , an exchange interaction _ is _ allowed by symmetry , and takes the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 . here and in the following , the pauli matrices @xmath48 act in the spin space . on physical grounds ,",
    "a ferromagnetic exchange ( @xmath49 ) is most appropriate due to hund s rule effects for orthogonal orbitals . for pedagogical purposes , we may wish to consider instead the opposite antiferromagnetic sign for this exchange . from the discussion in sec .",
    "1 , it is clear that an essential ingredient for excitonic ferromagnetism is the near - degeneracy of singlet and triplet states . to build this into the strong coupling model thus requires small @xmath50 . for the majority of the paper , therefore , we will neglect @xmath50 or treat it as a small perturbation .",
    "the analysis of the strong - coupling limit begins by first considering the on - site hamiltonian , @xmath51 , in the absence of electron hopping between adjacent unit cells .",
    "this may be thought of as the analog of the @xmath52 analysis of an ordinary hubbard model . in this case , the occupation of each orbital is a good quantum number , and the states can be straightforwardly enumerated .",

    "note that the doping behavior ( i.e. on increasing @xmath29 ) in this regime depends crucially on the relative strength of @xmath55 and @xmath41 .",

    "second , triplet ordering necessarily gives rise to _ either _ static spin moments or static spin currents ( or both ) within the unit cell . because the latter are presumably difficult to observe , this is a less strong condition .",
    "third , because the triplet state breaks spin - rotational invariance , it implies the existence of two low - energy collective `` magnon '' modes ( presumably dispersing as @xmath327 at low energies ) , which could be observable via inelastic neutron or raman scattering .",
    "fourth , an excitonic explanation for ferromagnetism upon doping requires that the `` pseudo - spin flop '' phenomena occur , and hence ( in this sense ) approximate su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "this approximate symmetry implies the existence of additional collective modes with small excitation gaps .",
    "it is natural to ask , given the above emphasis on the undoped state , whether the excitonic ferromagnet is itself truly a distinct phase of matter separate from the more familiar ( theoretically ) wigner ferromagnet ?",
    "the answer depends upon the extent to and manner in which the dopant _ ions _ influence the behavior of the electrons . in the models investigated to date , the dopants influence the material only insofar as to donate extra charge carriers , providing no perturbation to the _ potential _ felt by the electrons except to slightly increase the neutralizing positive background charge . in this treatment ,",
    "the lattice point group symmetries are strictly maintained , and the excitonic ferromagnet is indeed a distinct state of matter : it exhibits more broken ( point group ) symmetries than the wigner ferromagnet .",
    "in reality , the dopant ions most likely distribute randomly throughout the crystal , and thereby perturb the potential experienced by the electrons .",
    "this random potential explicitly breaks the lattice invariances , and washes out this sharp distinction between the excitonic and wigner ferromagnets .",
    "whether this effect is of practical importance is unclear .",
    "the large _ increase _ of conductivity upon doping suggests that the electrons are not strongly scattered by the dopant ions . in any case",
    ", the physics at low electron density is quite subtle . in particular ,",
    "the environment around a nearly isolated dopant atom retains a large fraction of the symmetries of the pure lattice ( e.g. a lanthanum dopant replacing strontium preserves cubic point group symmetries around the lanthanum ion ) .",
    "because electrons interact with only one impurity at a time at low densities , the symmetry of the local environment is expected to improve the distinction between wigner and excitonic ferromagnets .    clearly , further predictions are possible within more specific models .",
    "several authors@xcite  have recently pointed out the likelihood of phase separation at low electron densities .",
    "this occurs naturally in the pseudo - spin flop picture , but because it has already been discussed , we will not dwell on it here .",
    "probably most importantly , any excitonically - ordered state by definition breaks the point - group symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this symmetry - breaking is directly observable , but unfortunately depends in detail on the way it occurs . in particular , many of the triplet states that appear to be favored have less obvious order parameters , so that more work needs to be done to ascertain the appropriate experimental probes .",
    "further modeling using the strong coupling approach promises to help resolve these and other issues .",
    "thanks to c. m. varma for stimulating interest in this problem , and to z. fisk for providing copies of experimental data . this research was supported by the nsf career program under grant nsf - dmr-9985255 ."
