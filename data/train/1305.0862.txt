    "a reduced model for slow variables of multiscale dynamics is a lower - dimensional dynamical system , which `` resolves '' ( that is , qualitatively approximates in some appropriate sense ) major large scale slow variables of the underlying higher - dimensional multiscale dynamics while at the same time being relatively simple and computationally inexpensive to work with .",
    "this is important in real - world applications of contemporary science , such as geophysical science and climate change prediction @xcite , where the actual underlying physical process is impossible to model directly , and its reduced approximation has to be designed for such a purpose .",
    "reduced dynamics were used to model global circulation patterns @xcite , and large - scale features of tropical convection @xcite . typically , reduced models of multiscale dynamics consist of simplified lower - dimensional dynamics of the original multiscale dynamics for the resolved variables , with additional terms and parameters which serve as replacements to the missing coupling terms with the unresolved variables of the underlying physical process . these extra parameters in the reduced model are usually computed to match a particular dynamical regime of the underlying multiscale dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the underlying multiscale process changes its dynamical regime ( for example , in response to changes in its own forcing parameters ) , then the parameters of the corresponding reduced model have to be appropriately readjusted to match its dynamical regime to the new regime of the multiscale dynamics .    in some real - world applications , such as the climate change prediction ,",
    "the reduced models of complex multiscale climate dynamics are used to predict the response of the actual multiscale climate to changes in various global atmospheric and oceanic parameters . however , while a reduced model may be manually adjusted to match a particular dynamical regime of a multiscale process , it is unclear whether it should respond to identical external perturbations _ a priori _ in the same way as the multiscale process , without any extra readjustments . how do reduced models of multiscale dynamics , adjusted to a particular dynamical regime , respond to external perturbations which force them out of this regime ?",
    "is their response similar to the response of the underlying multiscale dynamics to the same external perturbation ?",
    "it is quite clear that the reduced dynamics evolve on a set with lower dimension than that of the full multiscale dynamics .",
    "how do the properties of this limiting set respond to changing external forcing parameter , in comparison to the full multiscale attractor ?    here",
    "we develop a set of criteria for similarity of the response to small external perturbations between slow variables of multiscale dynamics and those of a reduced model for slow variables only , determined through statistical properties of the unperturbed dynamics .",
    "we also carry out a computational study of the difference in responses of the full multiscale and deterministic reduced dynamics of the linearly coupled rescaled lorenz 96 model from @xcite to identical external perturbations .",
    "we compare and contrast both the actual ( `` ideal '' ) responses of the multiscale and reduced models directly to finitely small perturbations of external forcing , and the linear response predictions of the reduced models via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "two different types of forcing perturbations are used : the time - independent heaviside forcing , and the simple time - dependent ramp forcing .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows . in section [ sec : averaged ] we formulate the standard averaging formalism to obtain the averaged slow dynamics from a general two - scale dynamical system .",
    "section [ sec : response ] describes statistically tractable criteria to ensure similarity of responses between a two - scale system and its averaged slow dynamics . in section [ sec : implement ] we describe the first - order reduced model approximation to a two - scale dynamics with linear coupling between the slow and fast variables , previously developed in @xcite . in section [ sec : lorenz96 ] we introduce the two - scale lorenz 96 toy model which will be our testbed for this method . in section [ sec : results ]",
    "we present comparisons of the large features of the multiscale and reduced systems , including statistical comparisons as well as the ability of the reduced model to capture perturbation response of the multiscale system .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the results and suggests future work .",
    "a general two - scale dynamical system with slow variables @xmath0 and fast variables @xmath1 is usually represented as @xmath2 where , @xmath3 are the slow variables of the system , @xmath4 are the fast variables , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nonlinear differentiable functions .",
    "the integer parameters @xmath7 are the dimensions of the slow and fast variable subspaces , respectively .",
    "usually , a time - scale separation parameter is used to denote the difference in time scales between the slow and fast variables , however , here we omit it , as the framework for reduced models from @xcite , which we use here , does not require such a parameter to be explicitly present .    under the assumption of `` infinitely fast '' @xmath1-variables , one can use the averaging formalism @xcite to write the averaged system for slow variables alone : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the invariant distribution measure of the fast limiting system @xmath10 with @xmath0 above in being a constant parameter .",
    "we express the slow solutions of the two - scale system in and the averaged system in in terms of differentiable flows :    @xmath11    @xmath12    it can be shown ( see @xcite and references therein ) that if the time scale separation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is large enough , then , for the identical initial conditions @xmath13 and generic choice of @xmath14 , the solution @xmath15 of the averaged system in remains near the solution @xmath16 of the original two - scale system in for finitely long time .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the invariant distribution measures for the two - scale system in and the averaged system in , respectively . also , let @xmath19 be a differentiable test function .",
    "then , the statistically average values of @xmath20 for both two - scale and averaged systems are given via    [ eq : h ] @xmath21 @xmath22    now , consider the two - scale system in , and the averaged system in , perturbed at the slow variables by a small time - dependent forcing @xmath23 :    [ perturbed - eqn ] @xmath24 @xmath25    then , for small enough @xmath23 , the average responses @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the two - scale system in and the averaged system in , respectively , can be approximated by the following linear response relations :    @xmath28    @xmath29    for details , see @xcite . above , it is clear that any differences between @xmath26 and @xmath30 are due to differences between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , since @xmath33 is identical in both cases .",
    "the differences between @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , in turn , caused by the differences between the flows @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the differences between the invariant distribution measures @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are difficult to quantify in practice . in what follows",
    "we express the differences between @xmath31 and @xmath32 via statistically tractable quantities .",
    "first , we assume that the invariant measures @xmath17 and @xmath18 are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , with distribution densities @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively :    @xmath38    @xmath39    while it is known that purely deterministic processes may not have lebesgue - continuity of their invariant measures @xcite , however , even small amounts of random noise , which is always present in real - world complex geophysical dynamics , usually ensure the existence of the distribution density .",
    "integration by parts yields    [ eq : r ] @xmath40 @xmath41    at this point , let us express @xmath36 as the product of its marginal distribution @xmath42 , defined as @xmath43 and conditional distribution @xmath44 , given by @xmath45 it is easy to check that the conditional distribution @xmath44 satisfies the identity @xmath46 now , the formula for the linear response operator @xmath31 above can be written as @xmath47 we now denote @xmath48 where @xmath49 is small compared to either @xmath50 or @xmath51 for relevant values of @xmath52 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then , for the second integral in the right - hand side of we write @xmath53 where the first integral in the right - hand side is zero due to the condition in . neglecting the @xmath54 terms in , we write    @xmath55    @xmath41    at this point",
    ", we express @xmath42 and @xmath37 as exponentials @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are smooth functions , growing to infinity as @xmath0 becomes infinite .",
    "the latter yields    @xmath59    @xmath60    replacing invariant measure averages with long - term time averages yields the following time correlation functions :    [ eq : r2 ] @xmath61 @xmath62    taking into account the arbitrariness of @xmath20 , we conclude that , in order for @xmath32 to approximate @xmath31 despite the fact that , for long times @xmath63 , @xmath64 diverges from @xmath65 even for identical initial conditions , we generally need three conditions to be approximately satisfied :    1 .   for identical initial conditions",
    ", @xmath15 should approximate @xmath16 ( that is , @xmath49 in should indeed be small ) on the finite time scale of decay of the correlation functions in ; 2 .",
    "@xmath58 should approximate @xmath57 , which means that the invariant distribution @xmath37 of the averaged system in should be similar to the @xmath0-marginal @xmath42 of the invariant distribution of the two - scale dynamical system in ; 3 .   the time autocorrelation functions of the averaged system in should be similar to the time autocorrelation functions of the slow variables of the two - scale system in .    as a side note , observe that the nature of dependence of the conditional distribution @xmath44 on @xmath0 does not play any role in the criteria for the similarity of responses .",
    "in particular , the exact factorization of @xmath36 into its @xmath0- and @xmath1-marginals ( which means that @xmath44 is independent of @xmath0 ) is not required , unlike what was suggested in @xcite for the gaussian invariant states .",
    "as formulated above in sections [ sec : averaged ] and [ sec : response ] , the criteria of the response similarity are applicable for a broad range of dynamical systems with general forms of coupling and their averaged slow dynamics . however , the practical computation of the reduced model approximation to averaged slow dynamics depends on the form of coupling in the two - scale system @xcite . in this work , we consider the linear coupling between the slow and fast variables in the two - scale system .",
    "the linear coupling is the most basic form of coupling in physical processes , however , because of that it is also probably the most common form of coupling . for the linear coupling",
    ", the reduced model is constructed according to the method developed previously in @xcite , which we briefly sketch below .",
    "we consider the special setting of with linear coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are nonlinear differentiable functions , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constant matrices of appropriate sizes . the corresponding averaged dynamics for slow variables from simplifies to @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the statistical mean state of the fast limiting system @xmath73 with @xmath0 treated as constant parameter . in general , the exact dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath0 is unknown , except for a few special cases like the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite . here , like in @xcite , we approximate @xmath72 via the linear expansion @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the statistical average state of the full multiscale system in , and @xmath76 . the constant matrix @xmath77 is computed as the time integral of the correlation function @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the solution of for @xmath80 .",
    "the above formula constitutes the quasi - gaussian approximation to the linear response of @xmath81 to small constant forcing perturbations in , and is a good approximation when the dynamics in are strongly chaotic and rapidly mixing @xcite . with",
    ", the reduced system in becomes the explicitly defined deterministic reduced model for slow variables alone : @xmath82 where @xmath83 . in what follows , the `` zero - order '' model refers to with the last term set to zero ( such that the coupling is parameterized only by the constant term @xmath84 ) . for details , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in the current work , we test the response of the reduced model for slow variables on the rescaled lorenz 96 system with linear coupling @xcite , which is obtained from the original two - scale lorenz 96 system @xcite by appropriately rescaling dynamical variables to approximately set their mean states and variances to zero and one , respectively .",
    "below we present a brief exposition of how the rescaled lorenz 96 model is derived .      the original two - scale lorenz 96 system @xcite is given by @xmath85 , \\end{aligned}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and periodic boundary conditions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 here @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constant forcing terms , @xmath92 and @xmath93 constant coupling parameters , and @xmath94 is the time scale separation parameter . throughout this paper",
    "we will consider systems with twenty slow variables @xmath95 and eighty fast variables @xmath96 .    in lorenz s original formulation",
    "@xcite studying predictability in atmospheric - type systems , he begins with the uncoupled system @xmath97 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this system has generic features of geophysical flows , namely a nonlinear advection - like term , linearly unstable waves , damping , forcing , mixing , and chaos @xcite .",
    "the simple formulation , with invariance under index translation and a uniform forcing term @xmath98 , allows for straightforward analysis - in particular the long - time statistics of each variable should be identical and will only depend on @xmath98 .",
    "additionally , the chaos and mixing of the system are simply regulated by the forcing , with decaying solutions for @xmath98 near zero , periodic solutions for @xmath98 slightly larger , weakly chaotic quasi - periodic solutions around @xmath99 , and chaotic and strongly mixing systems around @xmath100 and higher .",
    "lorenz s two - time coupled system was introduced to study predictability and lyapunov exponents of systems with subgrid phenomena on faster timescales , and one of the authors of the current work has recent results showing that coupling two chaotic systems can suppress chaos in the slower system @xcite .      to simplify the analysis of coupling trends for the two - time system",
    ", we will scale out the dependence of the mean state and mean energy on the forcing term @xmath98 .",
    "due to the translational invariance , the long - term mean @xmath101 and standard deviation @xmath102 for the uncoupled system are the same for all @xmath103 .",
    "so we rescale @xmath0 and @xmath52 as @xmath104 where the new variables @xmath105 have zero mean and unit standard deviation , while their time autocorrelation functions have normalized scaling across different dynamical regimes ( that is , different forcings @xmath98 ) for short correlation times .",
    "this rescaling was previously used in @xcite . in the rescaled variables ,",
    "the uncoupled lorenz model becomes @xmath106 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are functions of @xmath98 .",
    "we similarly rescale the coupled two - scale lorenz 96 model : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the long term means and standard deviations of the uncoupled systems with @xmath90 or @xmath91 as constant forcing , respectively .",
    "it is this rescaled coupled lorenz 96 system that we focus on for the closure approximation .    before any numerical tests",
    ", one can already anticipate that the zero - order reduced system will be inadequate for this model even with such simple coupling .",
    "once the reference state @xmath75 is determined and @xmath110 computed , the zero - order reduced system is given , according to , by @xmath111 this is equivalent to perturbing @xmath90 by @xmath112 , which we expect to be small since @xmath105 and @xmath113 have zero mean in the uncoupled setting . in particular , we expect this perturbation to have only a small effect on the dynamics .",
    "however , in the multiscale dynamics it has been shown that a chaotic regime in the fast system can suppress chaos when coupled to the slow system @xcite , and this phenomenon is completely lost in the zero - order model .",
    "here we compare numerical results of the rescaled two - scale lorenz 96 system with its corresponding reduced system .",
    "in particular we look at the ability of the reduced system captures some statistical quantities and how well it captures mean response to perturbations in the slow variables .    in all parameter regimes",
    "considered , we have a slow system consisting of twenty variables @xmath95 coupled with a fast system of eighty variables @xmath114 .",
    "we use a fourth order runge - kutta method with timestep @xmath115 in the multiscale system and @xmath116 in the reduced system . to compute the mean response , an ensemble of @xmath117 points",
    "is sampled from a single trajectory which has been allowed to settle onto the attractor .",
    "using the translational symmetry of the lorenz 96 system , we rotate the indices to generate an ensemble twenty times larger .    on a modern laptop , the initial calculation to generate the reduced system for the lorenz 96 system takes only a few minutes ; once computed , numerical simulation of the reduced system is faster than the multiscale system by a factor on the order of @xmath118 .",
    "computing the mean response for a single forcing for 5 time units with a sufficiently large ensemble size ( @xmath119 trajectories ) takes over an hour in the multiscale system with @xmath120 but less than three minutes for the corresponding reduced system .      in section [ sec : response ] we outlined the main requirements for correctly capturing the response of the two - scale system by its reduced model .",
    "those were the approximation of joint distribution density functions ( ddf ) for slow variables , and the time autocorrelation functions of the time series .",
    "it is , of course , not computationally feasible to directly compare the 20-dimensional ddfs and time autocorrelations for all possible test functions .",
    "however , it is possible to compare the one - dimensional marginal ddfs and simple time autocorrelations for individual slow variables , to have a rough estimate on how the statistical properties of the multiscale dynamics are reproduced by the reduced model .    in figure [ ddfs ]",
    "we compare the distribution density functions and autocorrelation functions of the slow variables .",
    "the ddfs are computed using bin - counting , and the autocorrelation function @xmath121 , averaged over @xmath52 , is normalized by the variance @xmath122 .",
    "results from three parameter regimes are presented , and in all three regimes the fast system is chaotic and weakly mixing @xmath123 and the coupling strength is chosen to be large enough @xmath124 so that the multiscale dynamics are challenging to approximate .",
    "of particular interest are timescale separations of @xmath125 and @xmath120 .",
    "first we consider a chaotic and strongly mixing slow regime @xmath126 .",
    "figures are presented for the timescale separation @xmath125 only , because in this regime the picture is very similar for @xmath120 .",
    "we also consider a weakly chaotic and quasi - periodic slow regime @xmath127 . in this regime , the coupled dynamics are more dependent on the timescale separation so we present results for both @xmath125 and @xmath120",
    ". statistical quantities of other regimes , including regimes with more periodic behavior , have been presented in @xcite .",
    "@xmath128 +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we observe that the first - order reduced system ideal response is a much closer approximation to the multiscale ideal response than the corresponding zero - order ideal response . in these regimes",
    "the relative error of the first - order response is limited to about @xmath129 for the heaviside forcing and less for the ramp forcing , while in the zero - order system the error is around @xmath130 for the step forcing and @xmath131 for ramp forcing at time @xmath132 .",
    "remark that in the third plot for ramp forcing response in figure [ fdt_ideal_ramp_error ] there is a small bump in the relative error shortly after the onset of forcing .",
    "this plot corresponds to a weakly chaotic regime ( @xmath133 ) with a large timescale separation ( @xmath120 ) in the multiscale system . in this regime",
    "the small nonlinear fluctuations of the multiscale system are relatively large compared to the ramp forcing for @xmath52 near zero , so the relative error of the reduced system responses is large .      above in section [ meanresponse_subsection ]",
    "we discussed the actual responses of the statistical mean states of both the two - scale and reduced models to small heaviside and ramp forcings .",
    "for completeness of the study , we also attempt to predict the response of the mean state of the two - scale system via the quasi - gaussian linear response approximation @xcite of the reduced system . in the quasi - gaussian response approximation ,",
    "the terms @xmath57 and @xmath58 in are replaced with the gaussian approximations with same mean state and covariance matrices as in the actual dynamics .",
    "this , and the fact that @xmath134 in yields the following formula for the linear response approximation of the mean state response :    [ fdt - resp ] @xmath135 @xmath136    where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the mean state and covariance matrix of the corresponding unperturbed systems ( two - scale and reduced ) , computed as    @xmath139    @xmath140    for large multiscale problems the mean response may be difficult to compute directly , since the large ensemble size needed for an accurate average is compounded by an already large number of variables and small timestep discretization . in the case where the mean response of the slow variables is desired , one might prefer to compute the fdt response ( [ fdt - resp ] ) using a time series from the reduced system for a `` quick and dirty '' approximation to the ideal response operator for the multiscale slow system .",
    "we show the accuracy of this fdt response approximation for the lorenz 96 system , using a quasi - gaussian approximation with time series data from the zero- and first - order reduced systems .",
    "the quasi - gaussian response snapshots for the response times @xmath141 and @xmath142 are shown in figures [ fdt_ideal ] and [ fdt_ideal_ramp ] for the heaviside and ramp forcing , respectively .",
    "qualitatively , the quasi - gaussian response does capture the large features of the actual response , although most noticeable in these snapshots is the large exaggeration of the quasi - gaussian response calculated from the first - order reduced system , which predicts a much larger off - diagonal response than what is observed .",
    "the possible reason for that is that the distribution densities of the first - order reduced model are more strongly non - gaussian than those of the zero - order reduced model , while the time autocorrelation functions are more weakly decaying ( see figure [ ddfs ] ) .",
    "it was observed previously in @xcite that in these conditions the quasi - gaussian linear response approximation tends to overshoot the off - diagonal response by a large margin . in other words ,",
    "the better precision of the quasi - gaussian linear response of the zero - order model is the result of mutual cancellation of the two errors : first one is the error in the distribution density of the zero - order reduced model ( significantly more gaussian than in in the multiscale dynamics ) , while the second one is the error in the quasi - gaussian linear response due to non - gaussianity of the statistical state ( less in the case of the zero - order model ) .",
    "the relative error and cosine similarity are measured against the multiscale ideal response and can be seen for heaviside step forcing in figure [ fdt_ideal_error ] and for ramp forcing in figure [ fdt_ideal_ramp_error ] .",
    "the ideal response of the first - order reduced system is clearly the best of the four responses at capturing response in the slow variables .",
    "it is interesting , but perhaps not too surprising , that the least accurate estimate is given by the fdt response of the first - order reduced system .",
    "this should be expected since the quasi - gaussian approximation is only valid for well - mixing systems whose distribution densities are close to gaussian , which in particular is the case for the uncoupled lorenz 96 systems in a chaotic regime @xmath143 .",
    "however , such a system exhibits suppressed chaos when coupled to another chaotic systems , and the resulting distribution density will be far from gaussian @xcite .",
    "since the first - order reduced system matches more closely the multiscale system , and the zero - order system will behave as an uncoupled lorenz 96 system , the first - order system will be less chaotic and will be a poor candidate for the quasi - gaussian fdt response .",
    "in fact , for non - chaotic regimes , as in the case of @xmath144 where spatially periodic solutions emerge in the two - scale and first - order reduced systems , the long - time covariance matrix @xmath138 will be singular , so the quasi - gaussian response as presented will not be applicable",
    ". for further reading on blended fdt responses which might be more effective in these cases , see @xcite .",
    "in this work we studied the response to small external perturbations of multiscale dynamics and their reduced models for slow variables only . we elucidated a set of criteria for statistical properties of the multiscale and reduced systems which facilitated similarity of responses of both systems to small external perturbations .",
    "it was shown that the similarity of marginal distribution densities of slow variables and their time autocorrelation functions controlled the similarity of responses to small external perturbations of both systems .    like in @xcite , here we demonstrated that including a first - order correction term to a standard closure approximation for a nonlinear chaotic two - time system offered distinct improvements over the zero - order closure in capturing large - scale features of the slow dynamics .",
    "in particular , this reduced system was able to accurately capture the distribution density of solutions as well as the mean state response of the system to simple forcing perturbations .",
    "this correction term was relatively easy to generate , requiring only simple statistical calculations of the uncoupled fast system for an appropriate set of fixed parameters , and the resulting reduced system required much less computational resources than the corresponding multiscale system .",
    "focusing on the mean state linear response of the slow variables , we showed that forcing perturbations in the reduced systems have similar responses as in the two - time system .",
    "furthermore , we showed that using the unperturbed dynamics of the reduced systems for linear response prediction is also possible .",
    "however , in the parameter regimes we present here the first - order reduced systems are not rapidly mixing and do not follow a gaussian distribution , but the zero - order reduced systems do have these properties , so this fluctuation - dissipation response is effective only using the zero - order system . a linear response method which takes into account the non - gaussianity of the invariant statistical state ( such as the blended response algorithm @xcite , based on the tangent map linear response approximation )",
    "is apparently needed to capture the response for strongly non - gaussian dynamical regimes in reduced models .    here",
    "the linear response closure derivation and numerical results have been presented only for the special case of linear coupling between slow and fast systems , but this derivation has been extended to systems with nonlinear and multiplicative coupling @xcite . in future work",
    "we hope to extend similar results to these more general systems and to test the robustness of this method for application to a large variety of problems",
