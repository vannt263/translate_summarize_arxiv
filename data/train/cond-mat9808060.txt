    "perovskite manganites and their related compounds , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 rare earth ion , @xmath3 alkaline earth ion ) , have been studied extensively from the fundamental scientific view point as well as the technological one , since the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "@xcite in order to explain the unique magnetic and transport properties , special attention is paid to the orbital degrees of freedom in mn ions .",
    "@xcite the electron configuration of a @xmath4 ion is represented by @xmath5 due to the strong hund coupling . since an electron occupies the two degenerate @xmath6 orbitals , the ion has the orbital degrees of freedom as well as spin and charge .",
    "it was supposed that the orbital ordering is realized in insulating compounds @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , in the metallic phase , roles of the orbital degrees in the magnetic , optical and transport phenomena were also stressed .",
    "@xcite however , the direct observation of the orbital degrees was restricted experimentally to the case where the polarized neutron diffraction is utilized .",
    "@xcite    recently , murakami _ et al .",
    "_ have applied the anomalous x - ray scattering in order to detect the orbital ordering in single layered manganites @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite they focused on a reflection at @xmath10 point and observed a resonant - like peak near the k - edge of a @xmath4 ion below about 200k .",
    "they further observed the unique polarization dependence which is attributed to the tensor character of the anomalous scattering factor .",
    "since all @xmath11 ions are equivalent , the reflection at @xmath10 is forbidden .",
    "therefore , an appearance of the intensity implies that two kinds of orbital are alternately aligned in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "this type of the orbital ordering is termed the antiferro - type orbital ordering , hereafter .",
    "the experimental results also imply that the dipole transition between mn @xmath13 and mn @xmath14 orbitals causes the scattering .",
    "the experimental method was extended to @xmath15 with @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study theoretically the polarization dependence of the anomalous x - ray scattering as a probe to identify types of the orbital ordering in manganites . although the phenomenological model for the anomalous scattering factor was used to analyze the experimental results of @xmath10 reflection , it was not determined which type of the orbital ordering , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , is realized in @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite as for the theoretical side , several types of the orbital ordering is predicted in the wide range of the carrier concentration .",
    "@xcite once a method to identify types of the orbital ordering is established , this becomes applicable to the study of the orbital structure in not only manganites but also a wide range of transition metal oxides .",
    "considering the fact that types of the orbital ordering directly reflects on the anisotropy of tensor element of the anomalous scattering factor , @xcite we investigate the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity . through the numerical calculation in",
    "several orbital ordered cases , we propose the method to identify the orderings .    in sect .",

    "iii , the anomalous part of the atomic structure factor is calculated in a @xmath20 cluster .",

    "in this section , we derive the general formulae of the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity in orbital ordered manganites .",
    "the conventional experimental arrangement , where the polarization measurement is carried out , is shown in fig.1.@xcite it mainly consists of a sample crystal and the polarization analyzer including analyzer crystal and photon detector .",
    "the polarization scan is characterized by two rotation angles , i.e. , the azimuthal angle @xmath21 and the analyzer one ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the former is the rotation angle of the sample around the scattering vector @xmath23 , and the latter is that of the analyzer around an axis which is parallel to the scattered photon beam .",
    "the incident beam from the synchrotron source is almost perfectly polarized in the horizontal plane , i.e. , @xmath24-polarization .",
    "the direction of the electric vector of the incident photon with respect to the crystalline axis is changed by the azimuthal rotation .",
    "the scattered photon has both @xmath25- and @xmath24-polarization components , due to the tensor character of the anomalous scattering factor , which are separated by the analyzer scan .    in this optical system ,",
    "the scattering intensity is given by @xcite @xmath26 for @xmath27 = @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",

    "the structure factor @xmath57 in eq.([eq : amplitude ] ) is represented by a sum of the normal and anomalous parts of the scattering factor as follows : @xmath58 with @xmath59 here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the normal and anomalous parts of the atomic scattering factor , respectively , of the @xmath62-th atom defined in the @xmath55-coordinate .",

    "the contribution from the quadrupole transition is small , because the inversion symmetry is preserved in this system . @xcite",
    "as shown in the next section , the anisotropy of the tensor element in the anomalous scattering factor determines the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity .",
    "the anomalous part of the atomic scattering factor @xmath89 is calculated in the microscopic electronic model .",
    "we consider a @xmath20 octahedron and introduce the following orbitals in a mn ion : \\{@xmath13 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 } , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "six o @xmath94 orbitals , which contribute to the @xmath24-bond with the mn @xmath95 orbitals , are also considered .",
    "these are denoted as @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are @xmath101 orbital at the position of @xmath102 , @xmath103 at @xmath104 , and @xmath105 at @xmath106 , respectively , with mn - o bond length @xmath107 .",
    "the position of the mn ion is chosen to be @xmath108 . by utilizing the irreducible representation in @xmath109 group , these",
    "o @xmath94 orbitals are recombined as @xmath110 .",
    "for example , @xmath111 and @xmath101 orbitals are represented as @xmath112 and @xmath113    on these bases , we set up the following hamiltonian : @xmath114 the first and second terms describe the energy level in each orbital and the electron transfer between mn @xmath95 and o @xmath94 orbitals , respectively , and are given by @xmath115 where , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are the electron annihilation operators in mn @xmath95 , and o @xmath94 orbitals , respectively , with spin @xmath24 and orbital @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the third and fourth terms in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) , which describe the coulomb interaction between mn @xmath95 and mn @xmath14 orbitals and mn @xmath14 and o @xmath94 orbitals , respectively , are given by @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the number operators of mn @xmath95 and mn @xmath14 electrons , respectively , and @xmath123 is the number operator of the o @xmath94 holes .",
    "the explicit forms of the coulomb interaction in eq.([eq : v3d4p2p ] ) are written by @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 is the slater - integral between @xmath95 and @xmath14 electrons , and is defined by @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath133 where @xmath134 , and @xmath135 is the average radius of mn @xmath14 orbital .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the interaction between mn @xmath136 electron and mn @xmath13 core hole as follows ; @xmath137 where both @xmath138 and @xmath139 do not depend on the orbitals . the last term in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath140 , is the interaction between mn @xmath95 electrons @xcite defined by @xmath141 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the coulomb and exchange interactions between @xmath95 electrons with @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146 describes the hund coupling between the localized @xmath147 spin ( @xmath148 ) with @xmath149 and @xmath6 spin defined by @xmath150 .",
    "the electron transfer ( @xmath151 ) between mn @xmath14 and o @xmath94 is not included in the model . as mentioned above , the o @xmath94 orbitals are recombined by utilizing the irreducible representation in @xmath109 group , and the mn @xmath95 and mn @xmath14 orbitals are decoupled when @xmath152 and @xmath151 are taken into account .",
    "therefore , the essential conclusion about the anisotropy of the atomic scattering factor being based on the coulomb interactions is not changed , although a large overlap between mn @xmath14 and o @xmath94 orbitals may reduce the coulomb interaction between mn @xmath95 and mn @xmath14 and increase the one between mn @xmath14 and o @xmath94 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath153 and @xmath154 provide the anisotropy of the atomic scattering factor in orbital ordered states .",
    "the essential points in the mechanism of the anisotropy is the fact that these interactions depend on the occupied mn @xmath95 orbitals .",
    "when an electron occupies @xmath155 orbital @xmath156 , the energy of @xmath157 orbital is higher than that of @xmath158 orbital by @xmath159 due to @xmath160 , as a result , the scattering intensity near the k - edge is dominated by @xmath158 orbital .",
    "furthermore , @xmath161 state is strongly mixed with @xmath162 , where @xmath163 describes the state where a hole occupies the o @xmath164 orbital . through the inter - atomic coulomb interaction @xmath165 , the energy of @xmath166 orbital",
    "becomes higher than that of @xmath158 orbital by @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , the two interactions due to the intra- and inter - site coulomb interactions result cooperatively in the anisotropy of the scattering factor . in the following numerical calculation , @xmath154 is often neglected , since the inter - site interaction is well screened in comparison with the intra - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the lattice distortion in the @xmath20 octahedron also becomes the origin of the anisotropy of the scattering factor .",
    "when there is the jahn - teller(jt)-type lattice distortion characterized by the difference of the bond lengths in the @xmath168-plane and the @xmath66-direction , i.e. , @xmath169 , the energy difference of the mn @xmath158 and @xmath166 is brought about . in the case of @xmath170 , the energy of the mn @xmath157 orbital is relatively stabilized in comparison with that of mn @xmath158 orbital . therefore , this contribution competes with the above originated from the intra- and inter - atomic coulomb interactions . in @xmath171 where the @xmath172 is about @xmath173 , @xcite the contributions from the coulomb interactions seems to be weakened by that from the lattice distortion .",
    "however , the notable lattice distortion in @xmath20 octahedron is not observed in @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it was recently reported that in @xmath174 the x - ray scattering intensity attributed to the anomalous scattering is observed at ( 030 ) reflection in the @xmath175 phase , @xcite where the six mn - o bonds in the @xmath20 octahedron are equivalent .",
    "@xcite therefore , we conclude that the coulomb interactions dominate the origin of the anisotropy of the anomalous scattering factor in these compounds and do not introduce the contribution from the lattice distortion in the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) .    by adopting the above hamiltonian",
    ", we calculate the atomic scattering factor in the configuration interaction method . @xmath176 and",
    "@xmath177 states are introduced as the bases of the initial and final states , and @xmath178 and @xmath179 states are as the bases of the intermediate states . the second term in the right hand side in eq . ( [ eq : fa ] ) is only considered .",
    "the parameter values in the hamiltonian are chosen to be @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the slater - integrals between mn @xmath14 and mn @xmath95 electrons are chosen to be @xmath187 and @xmath188 which are the same order as ones between mn @xmath95 electrons @xmath189 evaluated by the photoemission experiments .",
    "@xcite the damping parameter @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fa ] ) is taken to be 0.5ev .    in fig .",
    "2 , we present the energy dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the anomalous scattering factor . the edge of the lowest peak of @xmath190 corresponds to the mn k - edge .",
    "near the edge in fig .",
    "2(a ) , where @xmath155 orbital is occupied , the anisotropy is clearly shown .",
    "the energy position of @xmath191 is lower and its weight is larger than those of @xmath192 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) where @xmath193 orbital is occupied , the anisotropy in the main peak is entirely opposite to that in fig .",
    "2(a ) . in both figs .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) , the spectra of @xmath194 and @xmath195 are identical as expected .",
    "by using the general formulae of the scattering intensity ( eq.([eq : intensity])-([eq : fff ] ) ) and the atomic scattering factor calculated in the microscopic electronic structure , we numerically calculate the polarization dependence of the normalized scattering intensity @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the number of the mn atom .",
    "the energy of the incident photon beam is fixed at that of the k - edge in a @xmath4 ion . in our model , it is chosen to be the energy at which the lowest component of @xmath198 @xmath199 has a half value of its maximum . the normal part of the scattering factor of a @xmath4 ion is chosen as @xmath200 which is about 5 times larger than the typical value of @xmath201 at the edge .",
    "@xcite the following part in this section is divided into three subsections and the numerical results calculated in several orbital ordered cases are presented .",
    "the qualitative features in the following numerical results , e.g. periodicity and phase of the oscillations as a function of @xmath64 , are independent of details of the microscopic calculation shown in the previous section and are related to symmetry of the orbital ordering and the experimental arrangement , although the detail quantitative ones depend on the adopted interactions and parameter values in the microscopic model .",
    "we consider the ferro - type orbital ordering ( orbital - f ) in the simple cubic lattice where a kind of orbital is occupied in each mn site and demonstrate how to identify types of orbital through the polarization analyses .",
    "the numerical results shown in this subsection will help us to understand the polarization dependence of the fundamental reflections in the antiferro - type orbital ordering shown in the next subsection .    in orbital - f case ,",
    "the structure factor per unit cell ( eq . ( [ eq : structure ] ) ) is given by @xmath202 at the @xmath203 reflection with integer @xmath204 .",
    "here , @xmath205 is the indices in the cubic coordinate defined as @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the lattice parameter in the cubic cell . @xmath208",
    "is the sum of the normal and anomalous parts in a @xmath4 ion with orbital @xmath209 ; @xmath210 . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we present the scattering intensity with @xmath211 which means that an electron occupies the @xmath155 orbital in each @xmath4 ion .",
    "it is calculated in the cases of @xmath212 ( azimuthal scan around @xmath207-axis ) . in the case of @xmath213 (",
    "azimuthal scan around @xmath214-axis ) , @xmath64 dependence is entirely opposite to that in fig .",
    "3(a ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the intensity is independent of @xmath64 in the case where the azimuthal scan is performed around @xmath66-axis .",
    "we first consider the contribution from the normal part of the scattering factor .",
    "the polarization dependence of the intensity is represented by @xmath215 , which is independent of @xmath64 due to the scalar character of @xmath216 . for convenience , the value of @xmath33",
    "is defined @xmath217 .",
    "this @xmath22 dependence is interpreted that the scattering at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is accompanied with the polarization of @xmath218(@xmath219 ) , where @xmath220 describes the polarization of the incident(scattered ) photon .",
    "therefore , the polarization dependence in fig .",
    "3(a ) is dominated by the normal part of the scattering factor and slightly modified by the anomalous part .",
    "let us examine the scattering intensity at @xmath33 in fig .",
    "this is represented by @xmath221 with @xmath222 since the normal part of the scattering factor dominates the scattering intensity , it is approximated as @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is negative at the edge . as a result ,",
    "the real part of the anomalous component decreases the scattering intensity from @xmath225 . in the case where @xmath155 orbital is occupied",
    ", @xmath226 has a larger value at the edge in comparison with @xmath227 ( see figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) ) .",

    "3(b ) , we present the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity in several orbital - f cases at @xmath33 . with increasing @xmath230 from @xmath211 ,",
    "the @xmath64 dependence becomes weak and disappears at @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) . with further increasing @xmath230 ,",
    "the phase of a modulation becomes inverse , since @xmath233 dominates the scattering factor near the edge .",
    "the inversion of a modulation in @xmath234 occurs at @xmath235 and @xmath236 in the cases of @xmath213 and @xmath55 , respectively . by combining the azimuthal scan around @xmath207- , @xmath214- and @xmath66-axes , it is possible to identify the occupied orbital in the orbital - f case .",
    "next , we consider the antiferro - type orbital ordering ( orbital - af ) , where two kinds of orbital sublattice , denoted by @xmath209 and @xmath237 , exist . in the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "there are three kinds of orbital - af , that is , layer - type ( orbital - aaf ) , rod - type ( orbital - caf ) and nacl - type ( orbital - gaf ) .",
    "these notations are defined by analogy with types of antiferromagnetic structures .",
    "@xcite in each case , two kinds of the reflection point exist , termed the fundamental reflection at @xmath238 and the orbital superlattice reflection at @xmath239 @xmath240 for orbital - caf , @xmath241 for orbital - aaf and @xmath242 for orbital - gaf . by examining the superlattice reflection , the above three types of the orbital - af",
    "is able to be distinguished .",

    "we neglect the difference of the normal part of the scattering factors of @xmath4 ions between the @xmath209 and @xmath237 sublattices .",

    "it is assumed that a @xmath4 ion has @xmath286 orbital , when the spin in a @xmath4 ion is parallel to that in its neighboring @xmath287 ions in the @xmath288-direction .",
    "@xcite this type of orbital ordering is consistent with the ce - type spin structure . here , we pay our attention to the reflection at @xmath289 termed the charge - order reflection , which appears due to the existence of the charge ordering .",
    "the structure factor at the reflection is given by @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the scattering factor defined in the orthohombic coordinate as follows @xmath292 for @xmath293 and @xmath237 .",
    "@xmath294 is the atomic scattering factor of @xmath282 ions .",
    "we emphasize that the difference of the normal part of the scattering factor @xmath295 is of the order of ( one electron)/(mn atom ) , which is much smaller than the typical value of the anomalous part at the edge .",
    "furthermore , the anomalous part of the scattering factor of a @xmath282 ion is scalar . its value is smaller than that of @xmath4 ions near the k - edge of a @xmath4 ion , because the edge is lower than that of a @xmath282 ion .",
    "@xcite therefore , by utilizing this reflection , we can obtain the information of the ferro - component of the scattering factor without disturbance of the normal part .    in fig .",
    "7(a ) , the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity at the charge - order reflection is presented .",
    "the types of the orbital is @xmath296 .",
    "the coordinate in the laboratory system is chosen to be @xmath297 .",
    "we neglect the contribution from @xmath298 , and assume that the anomalous part of the scattering factor in a @xmath282 ion as a scalar , that is , @xmath299 , and the value of @xmath300 is a half of the maximum value of @xmath301 @xmath302 @xmath199 in a @xmath4 ion .",
    "@xcite the explicit formula at @xmath33 is given by @xmath303 in the case of @xmath229 and @xmath25 in fig .",
    "7(a ) , the electric vector in the incident beam is parallel to the @xmath66-axis .",
    "it is worth noting that the polarization dependence in fig .",
    "7(a ) is more remarkable in contrast with that shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , because the scalar component of the scattering factor is smaller in the present case .",
    "furthermore , the intensity in the case where the electric vector is parallel to the @xmath168-plane becomes maximum , that is , the polarization dependence is opposite to the case in fig .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the polarization dependence is dominated by the anomalous term of @xmath4 ions . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "4(a ) the interference term between the normal and anomalous parts determines the polarization dependence . as shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , the phase of the polarization dependence for @xmath265 is opposite to that for @xmath304 . it is concluded that in the charge ordered state , by utilizing the polarization dependence of the charge - order reflection the ferro - component of the scattering factor in orbital - af state is identified easier than that in the case of fundamental reflection .",
    "in this paper , we have theoretically investigated the anomalous x - ray scattering as a probe to detect the orbital ordering in manganites . through the polarization dependence of the scattering factor",
    ", we showed how to identify several types of the orbital ordering .",
    "in particular , we paid our attention to the method to distinguish the two types of the orbital orderings ; ( @xmath305 ) or ( @xmath306 ) .    at the superlattice reflection due to the antiferro - type orbital ordering with the condition @xmath307 , the azimuthal angle dependence is represented by a square of the sinusoidal function and its intensity depends on types of orbital ( fig .",
    "we found that it is difficult to determine which orbital ordering ( @xmath305 ) or ( @xmath306 ) is realized by analyzing the results at the reflection .",
    "this difficulty is attributed to the fact that the antiferro - component @xmath308 of the scattering factor is observed at the superlattice reflection .",
    "then , we have proposed two kinds of polarization analyses where the ferro - component of the scattering factor , i.e. , @xmath309 , is derived .",
    "the first one is the polarization analyses at the fundamental reflection ( fig .",
    "4 ) , where the scattering factor is represented by sum of the normal part and the ferro - component of the anomalous part . the interference between them gives rise to the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity .",
    "since the normal part is much larger than the anomalous one , the orbital ordering reflects on the modulation in the polarization dependence . in order to detect the modulation ,",
    "the reflection plane is required not to include the heavy ions , such as a @xmath310 ion , because the large values of the normal part disturbs to detect the modulation .",
    "the reflection with the large scattering angle characterized by the large number of @xmath311 is also suitable , because the normal part of the scattering factor is reduced with increasing the scattering momentum , in contrast with the anomalous part .",
    "the second proposal to obtain the ferro - component of the scattering factor is the analyses at charge - order reflection points in charge ordered phases ( fig .",
    "7 ) . at the reflection ,",
    "the normal part is almost canceled out .",
    "the scattering factor is dominated by the ferro - component of the anomalous scattering factor in a @xmath4 ion and the anomalous part in a @xmath282 ion .",
    "the latter is a scalar and its value is smaller than that of a @xmath4 ion near the @xmath4 k - edge .",
    "therefore , by analyzing the polarization dependence of this reflection , the ferro - component of the scattering factor is observed .",
    "it is noted that the basic considerations in the above theoretical proposals are independent of details in the numerical microscopic calculation and are based on symmetry of types of the orbital ordering and the experimental arrangement .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that in the anomalous x - ray scattering technique , types of the orbital order is able to be identified by selecting the adequate reflection point and analyzing the polarization dependence of the scattering intensity .",
