    "various cosmological observations have now established that more than 80% of the energy density of matter in the universe is composed of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) @xcite . the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,",
    "however , can not explain this observation , and therefore there should be new physics beyond the sm which contains a dm candidate .",
    "one of the most promising class of candidates for dm is the so - called weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "these are electrically neutral and colorless particles which have masses of @xmath15  gev and couple to sm particles via weak - scale interactions .",
    "their thermal relic abundance can explain the current energy density of dm .",
    "such particles are predicted in many new - physics models ; for example , the lightest neutralino in the supersymmetric ( susy ) sm is a well - known candidate for wimp dm @xcite .    for a wimp to be dm , it should be stable or have a sufficiently long lifetime compared to the age of the universe . to assure that",
    ", it is usually assumed that there is a symmetry which stabilizes the dm particle .",
    "for instance , in the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) , @xmath16-parity makes the lightest susy particle stable and thus a candidate for dm in the universe @xcite .",
    "similarly , kaluza - klein parity in universal extra dimensional models @xcite and @xmath17-parity in the littlest higgs model @xcite yield stable particles , which can also be promising dm candidates .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) origin of such a symmetry is , however , often obscure ; thus it would be quite interesting if a theory which offers a dm candidate and simultaneously explains its stability can be realized as a uv completion rather than introducing the additional symmetry by hand .",
    "in fact , grand unified theories ( guts ) can provide such a framework .",
    "suppose that the rank of a gut gauge group is larger than four . in this case , the gut symmetry contains extra symmetries beyond the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "these extra symmetries should be spontaneously broken at a high - energy scale by a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a higgs field . then",
    ", if we choose the proper representation for the higgs field , there remains discrete symmetries , which can be used for dm stabilization @xcite .",
    "the discrete charge of each representation is uniquely determined , and thus we can systematically identify possible dm candidates for each symmetry .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss the concrete realization of this scenario in non - susy so(10 ) gut models .",
    "it is widely known that so(10 ) guts @xcite have a lot of attractive features .",
    "firstly , all of the sm quarks and leptons , as well as right - handed neutrinos , can be embedded into @xmath18 representations of so(10 ) .",
    "secondly , the anomaly cancellation in the sm is naturally explained since so(10 ) is free from anomalies .",
    "thirdly , one obtains improved gauge coupling unification @xcite and improved fermion mass ratios @xcite if partial unification is achieved at an intermediate mass scale . in addition , since right - handed neutrinos have masses of the order of the intermediate scale , small neutrino masses can be explained via the seesaw mechanism @xcite if the intermediate scale is sufficiently high .",
    "so(10 ) includes an additional u(1 ) symmetry , which is assumed to be broken at the intermediate scale .",
    "if the higgs field that breaks this additional u(1 ) symmetry belongs to a @xmath19 dimensional representation , then a discrete @xmath20 symmetry is preserved at low energies .",
    "one also finds that as long as we focus on relatively small representations ( @xmath21 ) , the @xmath22 higgs field leaving a @xmath20 symmetry is the only possibility for a discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "we focus on this case in the following discussion .",
    "dm candidates appearing in such models can be classified into two types ; one class of dm particles have effectively weak - scale interactions with the sm particles so that they are thermalized in the early universe , while the other class contains sm singlets which are never brought into thermal equilibrium . in the latter case ,",
    "dm particles are produced out of equilibrium via the thermal scattering involving heavy ( intermediate scale ) particle exchange processes .",
    "this type of dm is called non - equilibrium thermal dm ( netdm ) @xcite , whose realization in so(10 ) guts was thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "netdm is necessarily fermionic as scalar dm would naturally couple to the sm higgs bosons .",
    "depending on the choice of the intermediate - scale gauge group , candidates for netdm may originate from several different so(10 ) representations such as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "although the netdm candidate itself does not affect the running of the gauge couplings from the weak scale to the intermediate scale , part of the original so(10 ) multiplet has a mass at the intermediate scale and does affect the running up to the gut scale .",
    "demanding gauge coupling unification with a gut scale above @xmath25 gev leaves us with a limited set of potential netdm candidates .",
    "when we further demand the splitting of the gut scale or intermediate scale multiplets so that only a singlet survives at low energies only two candidates were left : in @xmath26 notations there were the dirac ( @xmath27 ) originating in a @xmath28 or a weyl ( @xmath29 ) also originating from a @xmath28 or a @xmath24 in so(10 ) .    in this paper , we study the remaining possibility , namely , that of wimp dm candidates in so(10 ) gut models",
    ". we systematically classify wimp dm candidates in terms of their quantum numbers and embed them in so(10 ) representations . as noted above and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of dm multiplets significantly affects the running of the gauge coupling constants . in this case , since the dm candidates are no longer sm singlets , the running of the gauge couplings is also affected between the weak and intermediate scales and may spoil gauge coupling unification realized in non - susy so(10 ) guts .",
    "we list wimp dm models in which gauge coupling unification is achieved with appropriate gut and intermediate scales .",
    "then , we study the phenomenology of these models , such as the relic abundance of dm , the dm direct detection rate , the proton decay lifetime , and neutrino masses . it is found that the condition of gauge coupling unification , as well as the proton decay bounds , severely restricts the wimp dm models in so(10 ) guts .",
    "still , we obtain some promising candidates , which can be probed in future dm searches and proton decay experiments .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the model setup for the so(10 ) wimp dm scenario .",

    "we begin with an overview of the basic so(10 ) model needed to accommodate a dm candidate . as mentioned above , in this work , we consider so(10 ) gut models and restrict ourselves to a two step simultaneous symmetry breaking chain , in which the so(10 ) gauge group is broken to an intermediate gauge group @xmath30 at the gut scale @xmath31 , and subsequently broken to the sm gauge group @xmath32 and a @xmath20 symmetry at the intermediate scale @xmath33 : @xmath34 the higgs multiplets that break so(10 ) and @xmath30 are labeled by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . as discussed in the introduction , this @xmath20 symmetry is a remnant of an extra u(1 ) symmetry in so(10 ) @xcite and is used to stabilize dm candidates @xcite . a brief introduction to the intermediate subgroups and @xmath20 symmetry will be given in sec .

    "[ sec : ydmbound ] and discuss conditions for the dm models to evade the direct search bound .    to keep our model concise , in the following discussion",
    ", we only consider so(10 ) irreducible representations with dimensions up to 210 .",
    "we start by giving a brief description of the ingredients in our model . in an so(10 ) unification theory , a generation of sm fermions and a right - handed neutrino are embedded in a @xmath18 chiral representation , while the sm higgs boson usually lies in a @xmath37 representation . to obtain a realistic yukawa sector",
    ", it is necessary to take the @xmath38 to be complex @xcite .",
    "we will keep this sector unchanged in most of what follows .",
    "in addition to the sm particles , the @xmath35 and @xmath36 higgs representations are added to break so(10 ) and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the last ingredient of our model is the dm multiplet , whose lightest component is targeted to be the dm in the universe .",
    "the stability of the dm is guaranteed by a remnant @xmath20 symmetry of the extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry of so(10 ) as we will discuss soon .",
    "possible representations for the dm multiplet are determined below . here",
    ", we assume that only a minimal set of the higgs and dm multiplets which are necessary for the symmetry breaking and mass generation of dm lie in the low - energy regime and other components have masses of the order of the symmetry breaking scale at which their masses are generated .",
    "for example , among the @xmath38 representation , only the electroweak doublet components remains light to break the electroweak symmetry , while the other components have gut - scale masses .",
    "also , to obtain the right relic abundance , the mass of the dm particle is taken to be of order the tev scale , while the masses of the other components are either of @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "such a hierarchical mass spectrum is obtained with fine - tunings similar to the doublet - triplet splitting needed for the @xmath38 . in principle",
    ", it may be possible to achieve the splitting of the dm multiplets with a more elaborate scheme of particle representations as in the higgs doublet - triplet separation @xcite .",
    "so(10 ) is a rank - five group so it contains an additional u(1 ) symmetry besides the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "this additional u(1 ) can be broken into a @xmath20 symmetry by a vev of an appropriate higgs field .",
    "if we restrict our attention to representation of dimension @xmath24 or less , the only choice of an irreducible @xmath36 that ensures the @xmath20 symmetry is a @xmath22 .. in addition , we note that a @xmath42 symmetry can be obtained by a * 672 * higgs field @xcite . ]",
    "this @xmath20 symmetry is equivalent to matter parity @xmath43@xcite , under which the sm fermions are odd , while the sm higgs field is even .",
    "thus a fermion ( boson ) is stable if it has an even ( odd ) matter parity .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : intgauge ] all possible rank - five subgroups and corresponding @xmath35 whose vev breaks so(10 ) to the subgroups . here",

    "@xmath44-parity can be related to an element of so(10 ) @xcite under which a fermion field transforms into its charge conjugate . in cases where @xmath44-parity is not broken by @xmath35 ,",
    "it is subsequently broken by @xmath36 at the intermediate scale @xmath33 . in this work",
    "we only consider the subgroups without an explicit su(5 ) factor .",
    "since the dm is necessarily a color singlet , the running of the strong gauge coupling is unaltered by the presence of a new dm particle below the intermediate scale .",
    "thus even though the addition of a dm multiplet yields unification of the gauge couplings , the unification scale @xmath33 is always less than @xmath46  gev as the contribution to the u(1)@xmath47 beta function is always positive . if we now associate @xmath33 with su(5 ) , this low partial unification is heavily disfavored on the basis of proton lifetime constraints .",
    "flipped su(5 ) usually has a high intermediate scale and a high gut scale close to the planck scale . in this case",
    "higher dimension operators suppressed by planck scale become important , and one may also need to rely on a double seesaw for the explanation of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "these bring extra complication into our model and we do not consider these possibilities here .",

    "the latter criterion often requires additional higgs representations to split the degeneracy of the fermionic intermediate scale representations if dm is hypercharged .    despite the potential very long list of candidates ( when one combines the possible different so(10 ) representations and intermediate gauge groups )",

    "let us first study the @xmath165 coupling . since @xmath35 is the adjoint representation of so(10 ) , the decomposition of this coupling in terms of the component fields has a similar form to the gauge interaction for a @xmath18 spinor representation .",

    "when @xmath167 and @xmath168 , the mass spectrum preserves the @xmath169 symmetry , while when @xmath170 and @xmath171 , then it is @xmath172 symmetric . if both of the vevs have non - zero values , then the low - energy theory is invariant under the @xmath173 symmetry .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath164 for left and right doublets have different signs , which indicates the breaking of left - right symmetry . here",
    ", we choose @xmath174 and @xmath175 to obtain @xmath158 .",
    "next we consider the mass terms generated by @xmath176 .",
    "the sm singlet in @xmath177 transforms as @xmath178 under @xmath179 , which acquires a vev @xmath180 to break @xmath39 into the sm gauge group . according to the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resultant mass terms are contains a @xmath28 , there is a contribution to the mass corresponding to eq .   at the intermediate scale proportional to @xmath181 with independent coefficients",

    "this is expected since @xmath180 is invariant under the su(5 ) transformation . from the above equations",
    ", it is found that we can ensure that only the dm component has a mass around tev scale by fine - tuning the parameters @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath181 .",
    "for example , to obtain the model @xmath189 , we can take @xmath190 then , @xmath191 acquires a tev - scale mass , while the mass of @xmath192 is @xmath193 .",
    "the rest of the components lie around the gut scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take @xmath194 then we can make only the @xmath195 component have a tev - scale mass and the other components have gut - scale masses .",
    "thus we obtain the @xmath196 model .    to simplify our argument , in the above discussion , we have taken into account only the contribution of the @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath181 terms , and neglected that of the other terms in eq .  .",
    "even in the presence of the other contributions , we can always perform a similar fine - tuning among the parameters to realize desired mass spectrum for our dm models .",
