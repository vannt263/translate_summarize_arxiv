    "are vitally needed @xcite .    for more than a decade",
    ", our collaboration has performed measurements of absolute dr rate coefficients employing the electron - ion merged - beams method at the heavy - ion storage ring tsr of the max - planck - institute for nuclear physics in heidelberg , germany .",
    "status reports on these activities have been presented repeatedly @xcite and a comprehensive bibliography of storage - ring dr measurements with astrophysically relevant ions has been published recently @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have concentrated on iron ions because of their prominent role in x - ray astronomy .",
    "iron is the most abundant heavy element @xcite and still contributes to line emission from astrophysical plasmas when lighter elements are already fully stripped .",
    "line emission from iron ions is prominent in many spectra taken with the x - ray observatories such as xmm - newton and chandra @xcite .    in dr",
    "an initially free electron excites another electron , which is initially bound on the primary ion , and thereby looses enough energy such that it becomes bound , too .",
    "the dr process is completed if in a second step the intermediate doubly excited state decays radiatively to a state below the ionization threshold of the recombined ion .",
    "the initially bound core electron may be excited from a state with principal quantum number @xmath3 to a state with principal quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "there are an infinite number of excitation channels . in practice , however , only the smallest excitation steps with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 dr ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 dr ) and sometimes also @xmath9 ( @xmath10 dr ) contribute significantly to the total dr rate coefficient . in the measurements reported here only @xmath6 dr and @xmath8 dr have been considered .",
    "energy conservation dictates that the dr resonance energies @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the total electron energies of the doubly excited resonance state and the initial state , respectively .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath14 can amount to several 100 kev .",
    "in contrast , @xmath11 can be less than 1  ev .",
    "calculating such a small difference of two large numbers with sufficient accuracy is a considerable challenge even for state - of - the - art atomic structure codes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , small uncertainties in low - energy dr resonance positions can translate into huge uncertainties of the calculated dr rate coefficient in a plasma @xcite .",
    "therefore , experimental dr measurements are particulary valuable for ions with strong resonances at energies of up to a few ev which decisively determine the low - temperature dr rate coefficients important for near neutrals in an electron ionized plasma or for complex ions in photoionized plasmas .",
    "almost all iron ions more complex than helium - like belong to this latter class .",
    "cosmic atomic plasmas can be divided into collisionally ionized plasmas ( cp ) and photoionized plasmas ( pp ) @xcite both covering broad temperature ranges .",
    "historically , most theoretical recombination data were calculated for cp ( see e.g. @xcite ) where highly charged ions exist only at rather large temperatures , e.g. , in the solar corona . at these temperatures ,",
    "recombination rate coefficients are largely insensitive to low - energy dr resonances .",
    "consequently , the theoretical uncertainties are much smaller at higher than at lower plasma temperatures which are typical for pp . if the cp rate coefficients are also used for the astrophysical modeling of pp , inconsistencies arise .",
    "this has been noted , e.g. , in the astrophysical modeling of x - ray spectra from active galactic nuclei by netzer @xcite and kraemer et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is clear , that the large discrepancies at low temperatures between the experimental and the early theoretical rate coefficients are due to a simplified theoretical treatment that was geared towards cp and more or less disregarded low - energy dr in order to keep the calculations tractable .",
    "modern computers allow more sophisticated approaches , and recent theoretical work has aimed at providing a more reliable recombination data - base by using state - of - the - art atomic codes @xcite .",
    "badnell and coworkers @xcite have calculated dr rate coefficients for finite - density plasmas .",
    "results have been published for the isoelectronic sequences from h - like to mg - like ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "rate coefficients for non - resonant radiative recombination ( rr ) are also available @xcite .",
    "independently , gu calculated dr and rr rate coefficients for selected ions of astrophysical interest @xcite .",
    "although the new theoretical work removes the striking low - temperature disagreement that was found between experimental and early theoretical results , significant theoretical uncertainties remain as discussed above .",
    "experimental benchmarks are thus indispensable for arriving at a reliable dr data base for the astrophysical modeling , particularly of low - temperature plasmas .    the present review is organized as follows . the experimental procedure for obtaining a dr rate coefficient from a storage - ring experiment",
    "is outlined in section [ sec : exp ] . in section [ sec : plasma ] the various steps for deriving a plasma rate coefficient from the measured data are briefly discussed . in section [ sec : iron ] illustrative examples are given for selected iron ions and , finally , fit parameters for a convenient representation of our experimentally derived dr plasma rate coefficients are listed for ni@xmath2 and fe@xmath0 with ( @xmath1=710 , 1322 ) . because of their dependence on subtle details of the particular atomic structure of each ion species reliable dr rate coefficients can not be obtained by interpolations along isonuclear or isoelectronic sequences of ions , i.e. , a separate measurement has been carried out for each individual ion .",
    "lithium - like ni@xmath2 has been included in this compilation since its dr resonance structure is relatively simple and therefore serves as a pedagogical example for the presentation of the experimental technique and the subsequent data analysis . throughout this paper",
    "we refer exclusively to the charge states of the primary ions before recombination .",
    "heavy - ion storage rings equipped with electron coolers serve as an excellent experimental environment for electron - ion collision studies @xcite . in electron - ion merged - beams experiments at heavy - ion storage - rings",
    "a fast - moving ion beam is collinearly merged with a magnetically guided electron beam with an overlap length @xmath15 of the order of 12 m. recombined ions are separated from the primary beam in the first bending magnet downbeam of the interaction region and directed onto a single particle detector . since the reaction products are moving fast and are confined in a narrow cone they can easily be detected with an efficiency @xmath16 of nearly 100% .",

    "as detailed in @xcite , there are three issues that require special consideration : the experimental energy spread , the recombination rate enhancement at low energies , and field ionization of high rydberg states in the storage - ring bending magnets",
    ".    the experimental energy spread @xmath54 influences the outcome of the convolution for resonances with resonance energies @xmath55 .",
    "this can be circumvented by extracting the dr resonance strengths , e.g. , by a fit of individual dr resonances to the measured mbrrc at low energies @xcite .",
    "an enhanced mbrrc is consistently observed in merged electron - ion beam experiments with atomic ions at very low energies below a few mev .",
    "there , the measured mbrrc exceeds the theoretical expectation by factors of typically 23 .",
    "this excess rate coefficient is an artifact of the merged - beams technique @xcite , and hence it has to be subtracted from the measured mbrrc prior to the calculation of the prrc .",
    "field ionization of the loosely bound high rydberg electron in the recombined ions can result from the motional electric fields that the ions experience inside the storage - ring bending magnets @xcite .",
    "for example , in the ni@xmath2 experiment , only dr involving capture into rydberg levels with quantum numbers less than 150 contributed to the mbrrc .",
    "the missing dr resonance strength up to @xmath56 ( where the prrc has converged ) can be estimated from a theoretical calculation using , e.g. , the autostructure code @xcite . for high rydberg quantum numbers this code reproduces the regular dr resonance structure close to the rydberg series limits reasonably well ( fig .",

    "figure [ fig : ni25plasma]b displays the ni@xmath2 dr prrc which has been derived from the measured mbrrc using the procedures described above .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is basically the 20% uncertainty of the experimental mbrrc . in some cases",
    "additional uncertainties arise from the subtraction of the non - resonant rr `` background '' from the measured mbrrc , from unresolved dr resonances at very low energies , from the theoretical estimate of the unmeasured high rydberg resonances ( especially for low charge states ) , or in certain cases from the presence of a then usually unknown fraction of primary ions in extremely long living metastable states such as the @xmath57 and @xmath58 states in berylliumlike ions @xcite and magnesiumlike ions @xcite , respectively .",

    "<S> this review summarizes the present status of an ongoing experimental effort to provide reliable rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of highly charged iron ions for the modeling of astrophysical and other plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental work has been carried out over more than a decade at the heavy - ion storage - ring tsr of the max - planck - institute for nuclear physics in heidelberg , germany . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental and data reduction procedures are outlined . </S>",
    "<S> the role of previously disregarded processes such as fine - structure core excitations and trielectronic recombination is highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> plasma rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of fe@xmath0 ions ( @xmath1=710 , 1322 ) and ni@xmath2 are presented graphically and in a simple parameterized form allowing for easy use in plasma modeling codes . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that storage - ring experiments are presently the only source for reliable low - temperature dielectronic recombination rate - coefficients of complex ions . </S>"
