    "the description of strong interactions in the nonperturbative regime is still one of the most important open problems in particle physics .",
    "it is believed that the strong interaction lagrangian supports an su(2 ) chiral symmetry which is dynamically broken at low energies , and pions play the rle of the corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "a simple scheme including these properties is the well known nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , proposed more than four decades ago .",
    "the njl model has been widely used as an schematic effective theory for qcd  @xcite , allowing e.g.  the description of light mesons as fermion - antifermion composite states .    in the njl model quarks",
    "interact through a local , chiral invariant four fermion coupling . due to the local nature of this interaction ,",
    "the corresponding schwinger - dyson and bethe - salpeter equations become relatively simplified . however , the main drawbacks of the model are direct consequences of this locality : loop integrals are divergent ( and therefore have to be regulated somehow ) , and the model is nonconfining . the absence of confinement is basically related to the fact that the dynamically generated constituent quark masses are momentum independent .",
    "this imposes a severe restriction on the range of applicability of the model , since a @xmath1 continuum opens up at energies of twice the constituent mass .",
    "since the njl model is nonrenormalizable , in practice it is necessary to apply some form of ultraviolet regularization , with the introduction of a finite cutoff parameter .",
    "the adopted regularization scheme has to be regarded as a part of the model itself .",
    "a variety of schemes have been used in the literature , such as sharp three- or four - momentum cutoffs , and proper time or pauli - villars regulators .",
    "although the model does contain regularization - independent information  @xcite , and results obtained within various regularization schemes are found to be qualitatively similar  @xcite , the choice of any particular scheme lacks a strong physical motivation .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that one needs further regularization prescriptions in order to carry out calculations beyond the leading order in the @xmath2 expansion ( a new cutoff is required for meson loops  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the introduction of a finite cutoff is somewhat problematic in the anomalous sector : if low energy theorems for anomalous processes such as @xmath3 are assumed to be valid , then the corresponding quark loop integrals should include a complete set of quark states . in the njl framework , this can be achieved either by leaving the anomalous diagrams ad - hoc unregulated  @xcite or by including additional terms in the lagrangian in order to recover the anomalous ward identities  @xcite .    as a way to improve upon the njl model , extensions which include nonlocal interactions",
    "have been proposed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , nonlocality arises naturally in the context of several well established approaches to low energy quark dynamics , as e.g.  the instanton liquid model  @xcite and the schwinger - dyson resummation techniques  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite also indicate that quark interactions should act over a certain range in the momentum space .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that nonlocal extensions of the njl model do not show some of the above mentioned inconveniences of the local theory .",
    "indeed , nonlocal interactions regularize the model in such a way that anomalies are preserved  @xcite and charges are properly quantized , the effective interaction is finite to all orders in the loop expansion and therefore there is not need to introduce extra cutoffs  @xcite , soft regulators such as gaussian functions lead to small next - to - leading order corrections  @xcite , etc .",
    "in addition , it has been shown  @xcite that a proper choice of the nonlocal form factor and the model parameters can lead to some form of quark confinement , in the sense that the effective quark propagator has no poles at real energies  @xcite .    in order to bring the problem into a tractable form , most of the calculations reported in the literature deal with nonlocal interactions which are separable in momentum space .",
    "in fact , basically two alternative schemes to introduce nonlocality in a separable way have been considered .",
    "one of them  @xcite is inspired on the instanton liquid picture of qcd , which indeed gives rise to an effective separable nonlocal four quark vertex .",
    "the other one  @xcite might be understood as a separable approximation to an effective one - gluon exchange interaction .",
    "considerable work has been done using one scheme or the other .",
    "this includes studies of the mesonic  @xcite and the baryonic  @xcite sectors , as well as the behavior of quark matter at finite temperature and densities  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to present a detailed comparison of both approaches and their relation with the njl model , analyzing the respective input parameter ranges for different form factors and discussing the validity of low energy theorems .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce a common framework to deal with the above mentioned approaches to nonlocal separable interactions .",
    "analytical expressions for mean field quantities , meson masses and decay constants are given for both schemes . in sec .",
    "iii , the validity of various chiral relations is explicitly shown . in sec .",
    "iv we quote some numerical results for definite nonlocal form factors .",
    "we consider here the widely used gaussian form factor , as well as a family of lorentzian functions which allow us to interpolate between soft form factors and sharp njl - like cutoffs .",
    "finally , our main results and conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "let us begin by stating the euclidean action for the nonlocal chiral quark model in the case of two light flavors , @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the current quark mass , which is assumed to be equal for @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , separable nonlocal interactions might be introduced in two alternative ways . in what follows , we will call them `` scheme  i '' and `` scheme  ii '' . these schemes",
    "are characterized by the form of the nonlocal currents @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) . in the case of scheme",
    "i  @xcite , the effective interactions are based in an instanton liquid picture of qcd .",
    "the currents can be written as @xmath9 where we have defined @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the pauli matrices acting on flavor space .",
    "on the other hand , scheme ii  @xcite arises from a separable form of the effective one - gluon exchange picture . in this case",
    "the nonlocal currents @xmath8 are given by @xmath12 the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eqs .",
    "( [ uno ] ) and ( [ cuoge ] ) , respectively , are nonlocal form factors characterizing the corresponding interactions .",
    "it is convenient to translate them into momentum space .",

    "in order to deal with meson degrees of freedom , one can perform a standard bosonization of the theory .",
    "this is done by considering the corresponding partition function @xmath18 $ ] , and introducing auxiliary fields @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , respectively . integrating out the quark fields we get @xmath22 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 the operator @xmath24 reads , in momentum space , @xmath25 where @xmath26 & & { \\rm ( scheme\\ ii ) } \\ \\ .",

    "in order to find the mean field values @xmath28 , one has to minimize the action @xmath37 .",

    "[ pieq ] now , one has to perform a wave function renormalization of the pseudoscalar fields .",
    "the renormalized pion field @xmath43 is defined by fixing the residue of @xmath44 at the pion pole , i.e.  by demanding that in the vicinity of the pole the corresponding contribution to the quadratic lagrangian is given by @xmath45 in this way , one obtains @xmath46 finally the @xmath47 coupling constant @xmath48 is given by the residue of the pion propagator at the pole , leading to @xmath49      by definition the pion weak decay constant @xmath50 is given by the matrix element of the axial current @xmath51 between the vacuum and the renormalized one - pion state at the pion pole : @xmath52    in order to obtain an explicitly expression for the axial current , we have to `` gauge '' the effective action @xmath53 by introducing a set of axial gauge fields @xmath54 . for a local theory this `` gauging '' procedure",

    "thus , for a given value of @xmath89 the chiral condensate only depends on a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath109 .",

    "we show the curves corresponding to covariant models , with different form factors . for comparison , in the lower panel",
    "we show the results obtained for the case of instantaneous nonlocal models  @xcite , and for the usual njl model .     for different models in the chiral limit .",
    "upper and lower panels correspond to covariant and instantaneous interactions , respectively . ]",
    "let us start by analyzing the results in the upper panel of fig .  2 .",
    "we observe that in all cases it is possible to choose a value of @xmath109 so that the corresponding condensate falls within the empirical range .",
    "for the case of smooth form factors ( g and l2 ) we note , however , that condensates in the lower half of the empirical range require quite large values of @xmath109 .",
    "an important observation is that when the form factors become sharper ( ln with increasing n ) the corresponding curves approach the values obtained for the step form factor .",

    "the step limit does not match the curve obtained for the 4dnjl model , i.e.  the njl model regularized by a four - dimensional covariant cutoff .",
    "this fact can be understood as follows . from eqs .",

    "\\frac{1}{\\,4\\,(1+x^2 ) } \\ \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the presence of the @xmath131 contribution , the step limit of the covariant nonlocal models does not match the 4dnjl result ( as shown in fig .  2 ) .",
    "it is not hard to check that @xmath131 comes from the integral of the term with the derivative in eq .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) , which is nonzero only in the `` surface '' region @xmath132 .",
    "the contribution of this term vanishes in the 4dnjl according to the usual regularization procedure  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results obtained within covariant models with those provided by instantaneous nonlocal models  @xcite .",
    "the latter are shown in the lower panel of fig .  2 .",
    "we observe that , in contrast with covariant models , instantaneous nonlocal theories with soft form factors such as g and l2 are not able to yield quark condensates that fall within the empirical range .",
    "this can be achieved only for rather sharp form factors , like e.g.  l5 .",
    "another important difference is that for instantaneous nonlocal models the curves obtained for ln do converge to the corresponding njl results ( i.e.the results obtained within the njl model with three - dimensional covariant cutoff , 3dnjl ) .",
    "it is worth to mention , however , that for this type of models @xmath50 is frame dependent , owing to the noncovariance . here , to obtain the results displayed in the lower panel of fig .  2 we have used the pion rest frame , which is the only frame where low energy theorems , such as the gt relation , are fulfilled .",
    "in the case of finite current quark masses , the model parameters @xmath5 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are usually determined by fitting the pion mass and decay constant to their empirical values @xmath135  mev and @xmath136  mev , and fixing the chiral condensate at some phenomenologically acceptable value .",
    "since this last quantity is not well determined , we consider here four representative values within the empirical range , namely @xmath137 , 220 , 240 and 260 mev .",
    "it should be noticed that , in the case of finite @xmath5 , for schemes i and ii one gets different expressions for the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ vamopincha ] ) and ( [ integrals ] ) , which determine the values of @xmath138 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the fitted model parameters are also expected to be different in both schemes .",
    "our results are shown in table i , where we quote the parameter values for schemes i and ii , considering different form factors and quark condensates .",
    "interestingly , the current quark mass @xmath5 is basically equal for both schemes , while the remaining two parameters ( @xmath109 and @xmath134 ) might be rather different , especially in the case of soft form factors and low absolute values of the quark condensate .",
    "perhaps the most striking case corresponds to the l2 form factor : for scheme ii it is not even possible to find a parameter set leading to a condensate of either @xmath139 mev or @xmath140 mev .",
    "for the gaussian form factor ( i.e.  the other `` soft '' function considered here ) , although we do find compatible parameter sets , the obtained values of @xmath134 in scheme ii for the case of low condensates are too low to be reliable for phenomenological applications .",
    "in table ii we quote the values obtained for @xmath141 and @xmath142 , together with the position of the first pole of the quark propagator , for both covariant schemes i and ii , and different form factors and quark condensates . as discussed in the literature  @xcite , the absence of purely imaginary poles in the quark propagator can be understood as a realization of quark confinement ( we are working here in euclidean space , thus a purely imaginary pole corresponds to a real pole in minkowski space ) .",
    "we remark that in the nonlocal covariant models studied here , instead of one single purely imaginary pole as in the case of the usual njl model one has in general an arbitrary number of purely imaginary and/or complex poles  @xcite ( we denote by `` complex pole '' a pole which has _ both _ non - vanishing real and imaginary components ) .",
    "in fact , previous analysis show that for most applications only the first pole , i.e.  the closest one to the imaginary axis , is phenomenologically relevant  @xcite . in the case of scheme",
    "i , as one can see from table ii , among the cases considered the first pole is complex only for a condensate of 200  mev and form factors g and l10 . moreover ,",
    "the case of l10 is not phenomenologically viable in view of the low value of @xmath141 .",
    "thus , we conclude that if one wants to avoid ( following confinement arguments ) the presence of low lying purely imaginary poles , the only acceptable situation for scheme  i is that which corresponds to a soft ( gaussian ) form factor and a low value of @xmath143 .",
    "if a low lying purely imaginary pole is admitted , then scheme i with a gaussian form factor and somewhat larger absolute values of the condensate can be accepted .",
    "sharper form factors would be excluded , leading in all cases to too small values of @xmath141 . in the case of scheme",
    "ii , one observes that sharp form factors also tend to yield small values of @xmath141 , the sole exceptions being the cases l5 and l10 with @xmath144 mev . in these cases , however , the situation is also problematic , since the first poles , although complex , have a very small imaginary part .",
    "this implies the existence of a very low @xmath1 pseudo - threshold , which would require additional prescriptions to preserve meson stability already at energies of a few hundreds of mev  @xcite .",
    "given the above discussed limitations of scheme  ii for soft form factors and low absolute values of the condensate , we conclude that the sets corresponding to g and l2 form factors and values of @xmath143 between 240 and 260  mev would provide the more acceptable results .",
    "notice that for these limiting values of the condensate the lowest pole turns out to be complex ( `` confinement '' situation ) and purely imaginary , respectively .",
    "concerning the values obtained for @xmath142 , it is seen that in all cases they are compatible with the experimental range , @xmath145  mev@xmath146 . now in table iii we quote the parameter values and the results obtained for @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the 4dnjl model .",
    "we recall that in this case the propagator has a single pole , located at the constituent mass @xmath147 on the imaginary axis .",

    "we have presented a comparative description of chiral quark models which include nonlocal covariant four fermion interactions .",
    "these approaches inspired in features of the underlying qcd theory represent natural extensions of the usual njl model and allow to overcome some of its difficulties , in particular those related with the regularization of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we have concentrated here in two alternative ways of introducing the nonlocality , which we have called scheme i and scheme ii . using a common notation , we have derived the main expressions to obtain the values of the pion mass , the pion decay constant and some important mean field quantities in terms of the model parameters @xmath5 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "in addition , for both schemes we have shown the validity of various well - known relations in the chiral limit .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations for gaussian and lorentzian form factors , studying the behavior of model parameters , constituent masses and propagator poles for given values of the chiral @xmath154 condensate within a phenomelogically acceptable range .",
    "the parameters have been fitted so as to reproduce the empirical values of the pion mass and decay constant . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the results for covariant nonlocal models have been compared to those obtained within instantaneous nonlocal models .",
    "we have found that , in contrast to covariant models , the latter can be hardly accommodated to yield phenomenologically acceptable values of the @xmath154 condensate . in the case of finite current quark masses , it has been found that sharp form factors such as l5 and l10 are also problematic , leading to either too low values of constituent quark masses or to the appearance of a low @xmath154 pseudothreshold , which would need additional prescriptions to preserve meson stability . on the other hand ,",
    "the results seem to favor quark interactions driven by smooth form factors ( in our analysis , g and l2 ) . in the case of scheme",
    "ii , large values of @xmath155 are found to be preferred , since lower condensates lead to too low values of the `` cutoff '' @xmath134 .",
    "for scheme i , instead , lower absolute values of the condensate seem to be favored in order to avoid relatively small constituent quark masses . as it is shown in table",
    "ii , in some of these cases one finds that the first pole of the quark propagator has both a real and an imaginary part , which can be understood as a manifestation of confinement .",
    "this pole structure is a characteristic of the form factor under consideration , and can be extended to more involved approaches such as e.g.  the instanton liquid model .",
    "finally , we have considered the case of the njl model regularized by a four dimensional cutoff ( 4dnjl ) , analyzing its deviation from a nonlocal model with a step - like form factor .",
