    "substrate induced strain plays an important role in the electric and manetic transport behavior of magnetoresistive manganites due to the strong inter - correlation between the spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom @xcite . in the critcal doping region ( @xmath10 ) , cmr manganites ( @xmath0 ) shows a ferromagnetic insulating state ( fmi ) between the paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) and feromagnetic metallic state(fmm ) and generally magnetoresistance ( mr ) collapses in this state@xcite .",
    "the strain between the film and the substrate also controls the equilibrium between fmm and fmi staes in manganites @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the properties such as the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath11 ) , resistivity(@xmath12 ) and mr are sensitive to the epitaxial strain as it can effect the jahn - teller electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the effects of epitaxial strain are different from the changes induced by external parameters like hydrostatic or chemical pressure as in - plane strain generally leads to an out - of - plane strain with different sign .",
    "the lattice - substrate mismatch induces phase separation and inhomogeneities in films and thus causes electronic behavior which was not found in bulk materials of the same composition@xcite .",
    "anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) is another important effect in manganites due to its possible application in magnetic memory devices .",
    "amr is mostly observed in the ferromagnetic(fm ) state of manganite thin films and strongly depends on the lattice strain , film thickness and the local inhomogeneity of the thin film .",
    "this effect has not been explored so much in the @xmath13 doped fmi manganites i.e. in the critically doped region@xcite .",
    "so it is very important to study the effect of biaxial strain , micro structure on the electric and magnetic transport behavior of the thin film of manganites in the critically doping region as the nature of the strain ( compressive or tensile ) can tune the system into more metallic or insulating state@xcite .",
    "the growth of good quality single crystalline thin film retaining fmi state is very important as the lattice strain can make the system fmm instead of being fmi or even more insulating without the fmi state . in this paper , in order to systematically investigate the electric and magnetic transport of low hole doped manganite thin films , we have made a single crystal like fmi thin film on @xmath14 ( ngo ) substrate from the target of @xmath15 by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) method .",
    "the target composition is selected near to the critical composition @xmath16 and as we stated earlier that the substrate induced strain can leads the film to the highly insulating to metallic state .",
    "fmi and fmm regions give us more freedom to investigate the strain effect on transport properties , transition temperatures and phase transitions . in this paper , we have shown in detail experimental investigations of electrical and magnetic transport of this thin film by varying the magnetic field from @xmath17 to @xmath18 tesla in the temperature ( t ) range @xmath19 to @xmath20 k. from the measurement we have found that the thin film behaves like a bulk single crystal sample of manganite in the doping range @xmath21 with substantial mr in this state .",
    "lattice strain significantly changes the @xmath11 of the film .",
    "there is a substantial amr in the sample which increases as the applied field increases .",
    "we have used pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) system using a eximer laser(krf , @xmath22 = 293 nm ) for growing the thin film on @xmath14 ( 100 ) single crystal substrate ( length 3 mm and width 2 mm ) from a 25 mm diameter @xmath23 target pellet . the laser fluence used for the deposition is @xmath24 and the repeatation rate of the laser pulse was 3 hz .",
    "the substrate was at @xmath25 and the surrounding @xmath26 pressure was 0.3 mbar .",
    "all the electrical and magnetic transport measurements were done on the thin film of length 3 mm and width 2 mm . for resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements of the sample ,",
    "we have made four thermally evaporated chrome - gold pad on the film and the four probe electrical contacts are made by attaching cu wires on the chrome - gold pads using silver paint . a current source ( keithley 220 ) and an electrometer ( keithley 6514 )",
    "were used for the @xmath27 vs t measurement .",
    "a cryogen free magnet was used to apply the magnetic field upto 10 t. for the characterisation of the sample , we have done xrd by xpert pro x - ray diffractometer . to avoid the joule heating of the sample",
    ", @xmath28a current is sourced for the electrical transport measurement with the current density @xmath29 .",
    "we performed high resolution xrd at room temperature to confirm the phase formation of the film as shown in fig .",
    "the major peak at @xmath30 matches with the ngo substrate and the small peak at @xmath31 is due to the film which is @xmath32 less than the standard peak of @xmath15 and @xmath33 less from the standard ngo peak .",
    "as the film is deposited on ngo ( 100 ) , the in plane lattice tends to adopt the same structure as ngo , and the out - of - plane parameter changes correspondingly to maintain unit cell volume . in this process",
    "the film will suffer a compressive strain in the xy plane as in plane lattice parameters aand bof ngo are less than the bulk @xmath15 while tensile perpendicular to the film since out of plane lattice parameter cis greater than @xmath15 ( ngo : a=5.431 @xmath34 , b=5.499 @xmath34 , c=7.710 @xmath34 and @xmath15 : a=5.506 @xmath34 , b=7.7465 @xmath34 , c=5.4769 @xmath34 ) .",
    "so the lattice constant dwill increase for the film and xrd peak appears at lower angle than the substrate and the bulk @xmath15 .",
    "we used the equation @xmath35 to calculate strain in z direction and fitted the sample and substrate peaks with gaussian curve .",
    "we estimated @xmath36 tensile strain along the perpendicular direction and the lattice constant of the film differs from the bulk @xmath15 and ngo substrate .",
    "the composition of the film from lattice constant value is expected to in the critically doping region of @xmath37 .",
    "broadening of the film peak can be attributed to the film thickness which comes out around 30 nm from the data which is in good agreement with our calibrated oxide deposition growth rate in pld .          in order to investigate the electronic transport properties of the film , temperature dependence of resistivity ( @xmath27 )",
    "was measured on the film from 50 to 300 k as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the @xmath38 curve , there are insulator to metal transition ( @xmath2 ) at 181 k and again at 137 k .",
    "ferromagnetic metal to ferromagnetic insulator transition ( @xmath3 ) occurs and it is the key features of the manganites sample in the low doping region .",
    "the high temperature electrical transport of manganites can be well described by the adiabatic polaronic model(@xmath39)@xcite and we have fitted the @xmath40 data with this model in the temperature range 208 to 300 k ( inset a ) and we get the activation energy ( @xmath41 ) = 135 mev with @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "it is well established that electrical transport in the fmi state follows efros - shlovskii variable range hopping ( esvrh ) model @xcite .",
    "we fitted @xmath38 data from 58 to 130 k with the esvrh model i.e. @xmath44 . from the fitting",
    ", we get @xmath45 = 6000 k and the coulomb gap @xmath46 = 80 mev . now to compare these results with the bulk value of manganites in the low concentration region , we plot our resistivity data with the available resistivity data@xcite of low doped single crystals in fig .",
    "3 .    ) , width=321,height=264 ]    from the fig .",
    "3 , we find that the resistivity of the thin film behaves like a single crystal and its magnitude is in between 0.2 and 0.22 doping region that means the composition of the film is changed due to the strain between the film and the substrate .",
    "we quantitatively compare the data obtained from @xmath40 plot of the film with the available data of single crystals tabulated in table .",
    "1 .    .[tab : table 1]comparison of electrical parameters of the thin film with different doping of lcmo [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table .",
    "2 , it is clear that external field decreases the activation energy for transport which in turn reduces @xmath27 and increase @xmath47 up to @xmath11 .      in our film , we established the presence of three distinct regions i.e. ferromagnetic insulating , ferromagnetic metallic ( fmm ) and paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) in the @xmath48 curve .",
    "it is interesting to study the field dependence of the magnetoresistance in these regions .",
    "we have measured the field dependence mr from 60 k to 275 k shown in fig .",
    ", width=340,height=264 ]    we have chosen the tempeartures for @xmath49(80 , 120 k ) , @xmath50(142 , 162 k ) and @xmath51(228 , 256 k).up to 162 k , the nature of dependence of mr on h is same but it change its sign after 202 k. we have fitted the mr vs h curve at different temperature with a equation @xmath52 , where ais the linear term and bis the quadratic term of the magnetoresistance .",
    "the estimated aand bas a function of temperature has been plotted in fig . 6 .",
    "we found that linear and quadratic terms have different magnitude and tempearture dependence .",
    "the linear term is increasing up to 180 k and then it is decreasing with t and always remains positive while the quadratic term changes sign and decreases up to 180 k and after that it increases again . through out",
    "the whole temperature range ais greater than b but bchanges its sign at higher tempearture and these two parameters give the parabolic temperature dependence of the mr .",
    "the most important feature is that both these parameters show peak at 180 k which is the @xmath11 of our film .",
    "anisotropic magnetoresistance effect ( amr ) in manganites is different from the conventional metallic systems@xcite and most of the study related to this effect has been done on the strained thin films of manganites in the optimally doped region@xcite .",
    "the lattice strain in the film due to the the lattice mismatch between substrate and the film generally plays an important role in tuning the amr.reduction of film thickness which increase the lattice strain can increases amr effect.recently amr effect is investigated in weakly doped lsmo ( x=0.16 ) thin film and on low doped lcmo(x=0.21 ) bulk single crystal sample@xcite .",
    "now as the resistivity of our film falls into the region between x= 0.20 and 0.22 bulk single crystal that means it is equivalent with the x=0.21 doped single crystal sample .",
    "so we have investigated the amr effect on this film ( fig.7 ) with high magnetic field ( 8 t ) and compared it with respect to the measurement of the x= 0.21 doped bulk single crystal with 14 koe field .",
    "amr is defined as the change in resistivity due to the change in current ( i ) direction with the applied field ( h ) .",
    "if @xmath53 be the angle between magnetic field and current direction then we have done the resistivity measurement of the film with different field ( 1 - 8 t ) with @xmath53 = @xmath54 and other with @xmath53 = @xmath55 i.e. when field direction is perpendicular to the current direction , however both are in the same plane . generally in manganites",
    "@xmath56 is greater than@xmath57 while in metal it is reverse . from the fig .",
    "7 , we can see that the @xmath56 is greater than @xmath57 and amr effect is gradually increasing with the applied field and there is nearly @xmath58 decrease in the resistivity of the film at 8 t in @xmath53 = @xmath55 direction .",
    "we have calculated the change in magnetoresistance at the highest field due to this effect and plotted in the right side of the graph in fig . 7 .",
    "magnetoresistance is higher for the parallel direction than the perpendicular .",
    "now the other factors which influence the amr effect is the local uniformity of the material and the increase of the spin polarisation due to the enhancement of the applied field and decrease of tempearture . in our case",
    "the change in the mr due to these effect is maximum in the fmi state as well as in the high tempearture phase .",
    "so like the x=0.21 bulk single crystal , we have also seen the prominent amr effect in this film .",
    "in conclusion we have made a single crystal like fmi thin film of manganites in the critically doped region by pulse laser deposition from a x=0.15 doped lcmo pellet .",
    "xrd of the film reveals that the film is strained and the electrical transport measurement confirm its single crystal like behavior and the doping region which is nearly x=0.21 .",
    "we have done the magneto transport of the film and found that it has a negative magnetoresistance as the bulk single crystal sample and the mr peaks at a certain tempearture ( @xmath59 ) and collapses in fmi state but its value is quite high in respect of the other single crystal samples .",
    "the @xmath59 of the sample increases with the increasing field and it is close to the value of @xmath11 at 0 t field .",
    "the @xmath11 and the @xmath60 of the sample also increases with the applied fileld but the effect is more prominent in case of @xmath11 which is the metal insulator transition .",
    "so like the cmr materials , insulator - metal transition temperature changes with the applied field .",
    "magnetoresistance of the film shows two kinds of field dependence ; one is linear and the other is quadratic and they varies differently with the temperature with opposite sign but more interestingly they have a peak at the @xmath11.at the end there is a noticeable amr effect in the film due to the lattice strain and the local inhomogeneity in the film .",
    "so we have done a detail investigation of the electrical as well as magneto transport of the single crystal like film in the critically doped region and tried to give some physical insight which has not done before .",
