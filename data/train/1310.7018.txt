    "every day millions of individuals all over the world make billions of orders to buy or sell stocks according to their own investment strategies and in reaction to huge amount of arriving information .",
    "these individual decisions taken together define very complex behaviour of the financial markets  @xcite and lead to such characteristics of the financial data like multifractality  @xcite , long memory , nonlinear correlations  @xcite , the leverage effect  @xcite , fat tails of financial data fluctuations  , known together as the financial stylized facts .",
    "the fat tails of pdfs mean that , for example , the nature of logarithmic price fluctuations ( returns ) differs from the gaussian noise model as the former can be much larger than the latter expects .",
    "the relative magnitude of the most spectacular events observed in the financial markets is a good example of this property .",
    "let us assume that we have a bi - variate time series of price and volume recordings collected over some period of time . in general , the returns can be defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is length of the @xmath3th interval of time , @xmath4 is stock price , @xmath5 is standard deviation , and @xmath6 is mean over all the intervals @xmath7 .",
    "for each return @xmath8 , there exists an appropriate trading volume @xmath9 .",
    "the intervals @xmath2 can be defined in various ways : they can either cover a constant number of consecutive transactions @xmath10 , be defined by constant trading volume , or be equal to each other with @xmath11 for all @xmath3 s .",
    "the latter definition is the most common one .",
    "it was documented in literature that the non - gaussian pdfs of the return can be described in most cases by power - law tails of the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "exact values of the scaling index @xmath14 depend on the return definition and vary from market to market  @xcite and from past to present  @xcite . the scaling index @xmath15 for the returns depends also strongly on either @xmath16 or @xmath10 .",
    "typically , one observes a gradual increase of @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath10 from an initial value of @xmath17 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is usually maintained over a range of the shortest intervals , towards higher values for longer intervals or larger number of aggregated transactions . this increase corresponds to convergence of the distribution of the returns towards a stable , gaussian distribution .    from pure mathematical perspective ,",
    "speaking about a convergence is a delicate issue in this context as the convergence towards a gaussian distribution induced by central limit theorem does not alter the power - law tail slopes .",
    "however , the following two remarks have to be made . first , any empirical data is finite and its pdf / cdf tails do not cover the distant regions which may reveal the actual power - law tails that are being repelled towards infinity while clt exerts its influence .",
    "thus , in econophysics literature it became commonplace that under the notion of `` power - law slope '' , one considers the effective slope of the power function that was best - fitted to empirical distibution in its non - central region . in this study",
    "we just follow this approach .",
    "second , one has to keep in mind that financial data is usually non - linearly correlated and can not be represented by i.i.d .",
    "processes  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the standard form of clt may not be completely adequate in this case , leaving space for its non - extensive generalizations ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the exact form of convergence might thus differ from the classic clt picture .",
    "on the other hand , tail shape of the aggregated trading volume or trade size distributions was a matter of some dispute in literature  @xcite , but nevertheless there is substantial evidence that , for at least the american and chinese stock markets , the trade size and aggregated volume pdfs can be described by a scale - free tails with the exponent @xmath18  @xcite , i.e. , around the lvy limit of @xmath19 .",
    "this implies that the volume pdf convergence towards a gaussian distribution is rather slow  @xcite .",
    "one of interesting empirical findings is that , for a given market , sometimes a simple relation between both scaling indices exists  @xcite : @xmath20 where specific value of @xmath21 depends on a study .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite reported @xmath22 .",
    "this relation was found empirically for those data , for which the effective power - law tails were observed .",
    "how it behaves for large time scales , for which the distributions converge closer to a gaussian distribution , has not been studied since the data samples are in such cases rather small .",
    "the above relation between the returns and trade sizes or volume ( depending on a definition of the returns ) can be related to the empirical price impact function @xmath23 describing how a trade or aggregated volume of a given size modifies the price .",
    "this function is known to be concave , but its exact form is debatable with possible logarithmic  @xcite or ( wider documented ) power - law relation  @xcite .",
    "the latter one can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is some positive constant .",
    "for example , gabaix et al .",
    "@xcite who considered the american stock market argued that @xmath26 , while farmer and lillo  @xcite reported @xmath27 for the london market .",
    "it was also seen that this function changes its form under a change of the aggregation time scale , going from strongly nonlinear for small @xmath16 or @xmath10 to rather linear for larger scales  @xcite .    based on results of their empirical study , gabaix et al .",
    "@xcite formulated a simple theory that was able to explain why both the returns and volume are power - law distributed .",
    "they assumed that large market participants - mutual funds , whose activity effectively govern the prices , are power - law distributed and that those funds optimize their trading strategies .",
    "their approach allowed them to derive eq.([priceimpact ] ) .",
    "this theory opened a debate , in which both the model assumptions and the empirical evidence , which it was grounded on , was criticised  @xcite and an alternative approach was proposed pointing out to fluctuations of liquidity and not the volume distribution as a principal cause of the form of the return pdf  @xcite .",
    "however , since the authors of the original model were able to rebut the main objections against it  @xcite , it now seems that the two approaches may be complementary and point out to phenomena that in fact coexist .",
    "here we do not want to consider empirical data in the light of either theory , but we rather aim at considering statistical distributions of the returns and trading volume for a market which was not analyzed before in this context and compare results with those known from literature for other markets .",
    "the warsaw stock exchange ( wse ) has total capitalization of about 180 billion usd ( august 2013 ) and , as such , is still counted among the small markets .",
    "however , many properties of data from wse are similar to the respective properties of data from the mature markets  @xcite . therefore , taking all this into consideration , it is interesting to verify whether any relation similar to eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) can also be identified on wse .",

    "the data comprises basically information on all trades which took place in this period but , unfortunately , it does not offer data from the order book .",

    "<S> this paper presents a quantitative analysis of the relationship between the stock market returns and corresponding trading volumes using high - frequency data from the polish stock market . </S>",
    "<S> first , for stocks that were traded for sufficiently long period of time , we study the return and volume distributions and identify their consistency with the power - law functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for majority of stocks , the scaling exponents of both distributions are systematically related by about a factor of 2 with the ones for the returns being larger . </S>",
    "<S> second , we study the empirical price impact of trades of a given volume and find that this impact can be well described by a square - root dependence : @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the properties of data from the polish market resemble those reported in literature concerning certain mature markets . </S>"
