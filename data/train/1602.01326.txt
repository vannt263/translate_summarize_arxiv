    "according to the dynamical universality hypothesis the dynamical properties of physical systems in the vicinity of their critical points can be grouped into universality classes ( similar to static ones ) irrespective of details of their microscopic dynamical behavior . there , in addition to the global parameters of a system , crucial role is played by the behavior of the relevant slow variables , namely order parameter and secondary densities associated with conservation laws .",
    "their dynamical behavior is described by a set of equations of motion of langevin type with gaussian noise terms caused by remaining microscopic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the order parameter and secondary densities is also important . in the simplest case",
    "such coupling is realised within the so called model c @xcite , where a nonconserved order parameter is coupled via a static term only to a scalar conserved density .",
    "being quite simple , the model can be used to describe different physical systems . in particular , a lattice model of intermetallic alloys @xcite , the supercooled liquids @xcite , layers on solid substrates @xcite are described by models with nonconserved order parameter and additional coupled conserved density .",

    "region @xmath8 , where the behavior of the secondary density is much slower than the behavior of the order parameter , corresponds to the stability region of the fp @xmath106 .",
    "however it appears to be unstable within perturbative field - theoretical rg @xcite , therefore region @xmath8 does not exist within the perturbative field - theoretical rg .",
    "it is known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath107 governs the stability of fps @xmath100 and @xmath102 .",
    "depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 the stability exponent @xmath107 will be positive for @xmath100 and negative for @xmath102 or _",

    "the border between the stability of the fps @xmath102 and @xmath112 is governed by the stability exponent with respect to @xmath78 : @xmath113 note , that for @xmath87 the transient exponent diverges as @xmath114 .",

    "critical exponents are universal quantities depending only on the global characteristics as space dimension @xmath1 and order parameter dimension @xmath0 . within rg",
    "critical exponents can be calculated as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . therefore studying the dependence of critical exponents on @xmath1 and @xmath0 we can extract from ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) the border lines between regions @xmath101 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 in @xmath2 plane . whereas condition ( [ cond1 ] ) is purely static and separates the region , where the static coupling @xmath98 is relevant or it is not , condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is a dynamical condition .",
    "it separates in the region where the static coupling @xmath98 is relevant and the order parameter follows the model a dynamics from the region where the genuine model c dynamics is present .",
    "it is therefore possible to improve the two - loop result for these two borderlines by using higher order field theoretical results for the @xmath121 theory and model a alone .",
    "there are two alternative ways to analyse perturbative rg functions in order to get universal quantities . within the first approach one",
    "applies @xmath3-expansion to obtain the corresponding quantities in a form of series in @xmath3 and then to evaluate them at the value of interest .",
    "within the second way of analysis one fixes the space dimension @xmath1 to a certain value and then directly solves the system of equations for fps numerically , the so - called _ fixed dimension approach_. in the next two sections we use these approaches to analyze conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) numerically .",
    "conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) include static critical exponents as well as the dynamical critical exponent of model a for the @xmath23 symmetrical model .",
    "these quantities are known now within high orders of perturbative field - theoretical rg .",
    "therefore we can use these expressions to study conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the condition determining @xmath111 ( [ cond1 ] ) coincides with the condition for the marginal dimension @xmath122 of a weakly diluted @xmath23 model according to the harris criterion @xcite .",
    "we can use the known @xmath3-expansion for @xmath123 obtained on the base of five - loop minimal subtraction rg functions @xcite : @xmath124    now we consider condition ( [ cond2 ] ) . note that model a quantity , @xmath125 , for a system with @xmath23 symmetrical order parameter",
    "is now known in four - loop order within the minimal subtraction rg scheme @xcite , while expressions for static critical exponents for this model are obtained in the next fifth order@xcite . to be consistent , we restrict ourselves only to the four - loop expressions for the static exponents . substituting them into ( [ cond2 ] ) and then keeping the coefficients as functions of @xmath0 and reexpanding the ( [ cond2 ] ) in @xmath3 we obtain @xmath126 in the form : @xmath127    formally , numerical values for @xmath128 ( [ nalpha ] ) and @xmath126 ( [ n1 ] ) at given space dimension may be obtained by fixing the value of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the series for rg functions are known to be of asymptotic nature @xcite therefore some resummation procedure should be applied to extract reliable information on their basis .",
    "different resummation procedures were successfully applied for numerical analysis of @xmath3-expansions obtained for some marginal dimensions ( stability borders ) of static field - theoretical models @xcite . to get border lines from ( [ nalpha ] ) and ( [ n1 ] )",
    "we can apply to them a pad - borel resummation technique .",
    "such resummation procedure has been successfully used in various tasks of theory of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the procedure is based on the integral borel transformation @xcite , and uses an extrapolation by means of a pad - approximant as an intermediate step @xcite .",
    "starting from the initial sum @xmath129 of @xmath130 terms @xmath131 we construct its borel image @xmath132 subsequently we extrapolate the borel image ( [ blimage ] ) by a rational pad approximant : @xmath133(xt)=\\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{l-1 } b_i ( xt)^i}{(1+c_1 xt)},\\ ] ] with the coefficients @xmath134 expressed in terms of the initial coefficients @xmath135 and the denominator linear in @xmath136 to avoid problems with multiple poles .",
    "the resummed function @xmath137 is finally obtained by the inverse borel transform : @xmath138 ( x t).\\ ] ]    applying ( [ blimage])-([res ] ) with @xmath139 to ( [ nalpha ] ) and then fixing the value of @xmath3 we can obtain the corresponding numerical value @xmath128 , while doing the same for ( [ n1 ] ) we can get the numerical value of @xmath126 . however note , that expansion ( [ n1 ] ) is one order shorter than ( [ nalpha ] ) . to obtain border lines within the same order we neglect @xmath140 term for @xmath128 ( [ nalpha ] ) .",
    "therefore applying the pad - borel procedure ( [ blimage])-([res ] ) to ( [ nalpha ] ) without the last term and to ( [ n1 ] ) and changing @xmath3 from 0 to 2 we get border lines @xmath110 and @xmath119 given by the green solid and dashed curves respectively in fig .",

    "as it was already noted , static rg functions are known up to the five loop order within the minimal subtraction rg scheme @xcite , as well as the factorial divergence of their coefficients in coupling @xmath97 is established @xcite .",
    "therefore we apply the procedure ( [ blimage])-([res ] ) with @xmath142 meaning @xmath97 now to the five - loop static rg function @xmath143 , as well as to the polynomials @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "note that in our calculation we use the two - loop expression for @xmath58 : @xmath146 .",

    "for @xmath162 we plot one loop values @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this region is also marked by + in the upper picture of fig .",
    "[ rho_omega ] . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ curves ] this artificial region turns out to be roughly similar to region @xmath21 found in the nprg analysis@xcite , however increasing the limiting value for border from @xmath165 to larger values below 1 one shifts the left border line to larger values of @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath166 this region of course",
    "disappears in our approach .",
    "in this study we have reexamined perturbative field - theoretical results obtained for model c within two - loop order without resummation . in order to do this",
    "we have used already known five - loop rg expressions for the field - theoretical @xmath23 model , as well as @xmath3-expansions known within high - loop orders for marginal dimension of the diluted @xmath23 model and for the dynamical critical exponent of model a. in particular , using four - loop @xmath3-expansion for @xmath167 we have derived the @xmath3-expansion for border line @xmath126 , that separates weak and strong scaling regimes of model c up to @xmath168 . our result is compared with the result of nprg approach @xcite obtained recently for the model c dynamics .",
    "our analysis qualitatively supports nprg results @xcite for @xmath169 and @xmath170 , leading to the wider region for weak scaling regime and larger values @xmath111 and @xmath120 in comparison with results obtained on the base of two - loop rg functions without resummation .",
    "however there are striking deviations in other regions of the @xmath148-plane .",
    "note that @xmath171 models are not appropriate for investigations for @xmath172 , because of a different physics in low dimensions .",
    "moreover , for @xmath173 ( that is @xmath172 ) it is obvious that @xmath3-expansion does not work because the expansion parameter @xmath3 now is not small . while in the nprg study @xcite only the local potential approximation with scale dependent constant at gradient term ( lpa ) was used with the truncation of a local potential of @xmath171 type .",
    "this approximation relies on the assumption that correlation functions with large number of legs have a small impact on the rg flow as those with fewer legs , as well as on the assumption that the anomalous dimension is small .",
    "this is not the case for the low - dimensional systems ( @xmath172 ) , therefore high - order field expansions should be used to go below @xmath174 .",
    "finite truncations within the nprg approach have another unpleasant effect : they induce a residual dependence of the physical quantities on the choice of a cut - off function used to suppress low - momentum fluctuations .",
    "the nprg approach of ref.@xcite uses a sharp @xmath175-cut - off , which , although nonanalytical in its nature , leads to analytical expressions of non - perturbative @xmath56-functions .",
    "however other cut - off functions like a power - law or an exponential can be used .",
    "for instance , data of a nprg study of the two - dimensional @xmath176 model with the help of an optimized exponential cut - off function are in very good agreement with universal features of the kosterlitz - touless transition @xcite . probably the non - monotonic behavior of the border line between regions @xmath24 and @xmath27 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( black dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ curves ] ) is a consequence of the use of the @xmath175-cut - off function . in any case",
    "it is interesting to have data from other choice of a cut - off function .",
    "the check of model c behavior at @xmath177 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite on the base of monte carlo simulations for saw models in fractal dimensions is not reliable , since the similarity between saw and @xmath178 model was proven only for the static case @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relation between the non - integer dimension arising due to the analytic continuation in field theories ( e.g. via @xmath3-expansion ) and fractal dimension is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "conditions that govern the borders between regions @xmath101 and @xmath24 ( [ cond1 ] ) as well as between @xmath24 and @xmath27 ( [ cond2 ] ) are valid to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "therefore it can be also checked within the nprg approach on the base of a simpler @xmath23-model and dynamical model a. however model a critical dynamics was studied within nprg for a scalar order parameter only@xcite . moreover ,",
    "despite recent nprg studies of @xmath23 models in fractional dimensions @xcite the condition for a vanishing exponent @xmath17 was not a subject of interest .",
    "the most intriguing point and a genuine model c feature is that nprg results are in favor of the existence of an anomalous region @xmath8 . within this approach region @xmath8",
    "is described by a stable solution with @xmath179 and @xmath180 , as well as with a critical exponents @xmath181 .",
    "this result requires its confirmation by studies with more elaborate truncations as well as with other choices of a cut - off function . concerning the perturbative field - theoretical rg approach ,",
    "region @xmath8 can be checked only if high - loop order dynamical rg functions will be accessible .",
    "they can possibly lead to new solutions for dynamical fps or a change of stability of the present found fps .",
    "however one should be careful trusting new solutions obtained only in high orders of perturbations , because they might be controversial ( see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite , where one can find a discussion about conflicting results of perturbed field - theoretical rg and nprg approaches for frustrated magnets ) .",
