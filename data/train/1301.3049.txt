    "since in both of the models @xmath42 , we understand that the discriminant of eq .",
    "( [ resultmatter ] ) is negative and dark energy oscillates with frequency @xmath43 .",
    "since by increasing the curvature @xmath44 tends to zero , for large values of the redshift the dark energy density oscillates with a high frequency and also its derivatives become large and may be dominant in some derivatives of the hubble parameter which approach an effective singularity making unphysical the solution .",
    "moreover , it may be stated that the closer the model is to the @xmath1cdm model ( i.e. , as much @xmath44 is close to zero ) , the bigger the oscillation frequency of dark energy becomes .",

    "the jerk parameter oscillates with the same frequency of the dark energy , but here such oscillations have a constant frequency and do not diverge at high red shift . + it is also important to stress that the term added to stabilize the dark energy oscillations in the matter dominated epoch does not cause any problem to the good proprieties of the models ( [ hs])-([expmodel ] ) , which continue to satisfy all the cosmological and local gravity constraints .",
    "it has been demonstrated in several papers that in order to evade the solar system tests  @xcite or avoid large corrections to newton law at large cosmological scales  @xcite , a modified gravity theory must satisfy the following relation @xmath61 when @xmath5 assumes the typical curvature value of the constant background around a matter source .",
    "for the models  ( [ hs])-([expmodel ] ) without correction terms , this condition is always well satisfied , due to the fact that @xmath62 . next , if we consider the addition of @xmath45 , whose second derivative is dominant , the left side of the letter equation reads @xmath63 .",
    "despite the fact that this quantity is smaller than the one obtained for the pure models ( [ hs])-([expmodel ] ) , it still remains sufficiently large and the correction to the newton law is very small .",
    "for example , at the typical value of the curvature in the solar system , namely @xmath64ev@xmath65 , it corresponds to @xmath66 , which is very large effectively . concerning the matter instability  @xcite",

    "after the discovery of cosmic acceleration , a lot of theories for the dark energy have been proposed , and it has become very important to find a way to discriminating among these theories , most of them exhibit the same expansion history . in this context , the characterization of growth of the matter density perturbations is very significant in modified gravity , since models with the same cosmological evolution have a different cosmic growth history . in order to execute it",

    "the growth index can not be observed directly , but it can be determined from the observational data of both the growth factor and the matter density parameter at the same redshift and this is the reason for which in the last period its calculation in different theories has become of a great interest . in ref .",

    "these models possess one crossing in the recent past , after the end of the matter dominated era , and infinite crossings in the future , but the amplitude of such crossings decreases as @xmath98 and it does not cause any serious problem to the accuracy of the cosmological evolution during the de sitter epoch which is in general the final attractor of the system . however , since the existence of a phantom phase can give some undesirable effects such as the possibility to have the big rip  @xcite or big rip scenario with the disintegration of bound structures  @xcite , it is important to observe that in the models  ( [ hs])-([expmodel ] ) with the adding modification ( [ correctionterm ] ) , the effective eos parameter of the universe @xmath99 never crosses the phantom divide line in the past , and that only in the very far future , when @xmath18 is very close to @xmath100 , it coincides with @xmath101 and the crossings occur .",

    "an accurate analysis of this model shows that if @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we avoid the effects of inflation at small curvatures and it does not influence the stability of the matter dominated era .",
