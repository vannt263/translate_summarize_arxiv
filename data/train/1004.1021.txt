    "@xcite discharge patterns such as lightning are also typical branching patterns.@xcite in creeping discharge , a strong voltage is applied at a point electrode on the surface of dielectric materials .",
    "discharge patterns appear around the point electrode at the interface between the dielectric materials and the surrounding gas or liquid . in a suitable range of voltages ,",
    "densely branched patterns are observed , that are called lichtenberg figures .",
    "fractal analysis was performed for the lichtenberg figures obtained in experiments by several groups.@xcite kebbabi and bernounal found that the fractal dimension decreases with increasing thickness of dielectric materials .",
    "the dla model is a simple stochastic model that can generate a fractal branching pattern.@xcite the fractal dimension is 1.71 in the dla model .",
    "however , there are a variety of discharge patterns , which have various fractal dimensions @xmath0 . in typical patterns in lightning discharge ,",
    "the fractal dimension is rather small , e.g. , @xmath1 . for densely branched lichtenberg figures ,",
    "the fractal dimension is @xmath2 .",
    "the dla model was generalized for application to the various discharge patterns .",
    "niemeyer et al . proposed the @xmath3 model in which the growth probability is proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electric field.@xcite wiesmann and zeller proposed another model in which the growth probability is proportional to @xmath6 for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the threshold value of discharge.@xcite kuoershtokh et al .",
    "proposed another stochastic model in which there is a transition from a weak discharge ( streamer ) to a strong discharge ( leader).@xcite we proposed a deterministic electric circuit model of branching patterns in the barrier discharge where an alternating voltage is applied between dielectric electrodes.@xcite    various complicated dynamics are observed in the growth process of discharge patterns . for creeping discharge ,",
    "growth dynamics was studied experimentally using a high - speed camera .",
    "when the electric voltage @xmath9 is increased over its threshold value , surface corona appears locally around the central electrode .",
    "the corona discharge is a weak discharge that appears locally around a sharp electrode .",
    "when @xmath9 is beyond a second threshold , surface leaders appear , which make a branching pattern .",
    "a surface leader shows a stronger discharge than the surface corona .",
    "the surface corona grows further around the tips of surface leaders .",
    "the length of surface leaders increases with @xmath9.@xcite when a surface leader reaches the outer electrode , a flashover occurs , and a large current flows , leading to dielectric breakdown .",
    "the growth of surface leaders is not always smooth in time , but intermittent in time.@xcite a similar intermittent growth of the leaders is well known in lightning discharge.@xcite when a leader goes down from a thunder cloud to the ground , it moves in steps of about 30 m with a pause of about 40 ms between steps .",
    "this leader is called the stepped leader .",
    "when the leader reaches the ground , a flashover occurs and a strong flash called a return stroke appears , which we observe as lightning .",
    "the origin of stepped leaders is not completely understood .",
    "there are several qualitative theories of such stepped leaders .",
    "bruce pointed out the importance of the transition from a weak glow discharge to a strong arc discharge.@xcite kumar and nagabhushana proposed a simulation model of stepped leaders based on a complicated electric breakdown process.@xcite    in this paper , we propose a simple deterministic electric circuit model composed of resistors and capacitors for the creeping discharge and perform numerical simulation .",
    "we have assumed a two - step function for the conductance , which exhibits a transition from a weak discharge to a strong discharge .",
    "we show that densely branched patterns appear when the capacitance is relatively large .",
    "we find an intermittent growth of the discharge pattern , which is similar to the stepped leader .",
    "our electric circuit model is composed of capacitors and resistors whose conductance changes with the voltage .",
    "the conductance @xmath10 of the resistance is assumed to change stepwise as shown in fig .",
    "the conductance @xmath10 increases rapidly owing to the ionization , when voltage is increased beyond its threshold value and the discharge sets in . taking another transition between the surface corona to the surface leader into account , we assume that there is another threshold and the conductance @xmath10 increases further at the second threshold .",
    "we study a dynamical system for @xmath10 and the electric potential @xmath9 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath10 is assumed to obey @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electric potential difference , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two threshold values , @xmath15 are the stepped values of conductance , and @xmath16 is a time constant .",

    "figure 3(d ) shows the fractal dimension @xmath38 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath24 is increased , the discharge pattern is more densely branched and the fractal dimension increases , although the discharge pattern stops finally and the fractal dimension can not be precisely evaluated using a sufficiently large pattern . in the experiment by kebbabi and berounal , the fractal dimension becomes smaller as the thickness @xmath64 of the dielectric material is increased .",

    "the corona discharge further grows around the tips of the surface leaders . in the numerical simulations in the previous section ,",
    "we have used a slightly random initial conditions for @xmath20 s .",
    "if the initial conditions are uniform , a symmetrical pattern appears .",

    "the number @xmath72 is proportional to the total length of the surface leaders .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows that the surface leaders grow stepwise in time .",
    "that is , the surface leaders stop and go intermittently .",
    "for example , the surface leaders grow rapidly at @xmath73 from the inner electrode and stop at @xmath74 .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of the stepped leaders in lightning discharge . even under the previous random initial conditions ,",
    "this type of stepped leader is observed for each branch , but the total number @xmath66 exhibits no such clear stepped behavior except for the first step from @xmath75 , because the timing of the stop - and - go is different for each branch .    to understand the behavior of the stepped leaders , we have simulated an even simpler model system where only the edges on the six straight lines can be discharged , as shown in fig .",

    "5(d ) show a quasi-3d plot of the time evolution of @xmath70 on the central line @xmath69 .",
    "the behavior of the stepped leaders is clearly observed in fig .",
    "the interaction between the corona discharge , surface leader , and electric potential is important for the intermittent motion . when @xmath82 , the difference between the two types of discharge disappears , and then we have observed no intermittent motion .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with previous observations by shimazaki et al.@xcite and bruce@xcite .",
    "we have constructed a simple deterministic electric circuit model for creeping discharge . we have found that random branching patterns appear , even though the system parameters are uniform .",
    "we have found that more densely branched patterns appear as the capacitance @xmath24 increases , which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental result .",
    "we have numerically found the behavior of stepped leaders , which seems to originate from the interaction with the corona discharge and surface leaders , although the detailed theoretical analysis of the stepped leaders is left for future study .",
    "a similar intermittent growth is observed in other systems .",
    "the stick - slip motion in the frictional oscillation is a typical example .",
    "the threshold by the maximum static friction plays an important role in the stick - slip motion .",

    "proposed a coupled map lattice model of the periodic growth.@xcite the transition from a facet growth to a diffusion - limited growth is induced by a certain threshold voltage in this electrodeposition system .",
    "we think that there is some analogy in these systems , in that there is a transition between different states via some threshold values .",
