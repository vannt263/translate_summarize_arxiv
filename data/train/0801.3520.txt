    "the game theory went to the statistical physics @xcite as a strong mathematical tool of economy @xcite , biology @xcite and social sciences @xcite .",
    "initially , it relied on the assumption of rational choice .",
    "this condition was later released by the concept of bounded rationality @xcite and adaptive rather than rational thinking ; this should not be understood as less logic , but rather logic with limited information. in the never - ending discussion on the applicability of mathematical tools to describe the human behavior , this adaptive thinking is a keyword .",
    "indeed , in many cases the human behavior can not be explained within the frames of individual rationality .",
    "if a society persists longer than the lifetime of its members , it develops ways to induce cooperation and altruism in further generations ; examples of individual sacrifices constitute tradition and serve as social norms . as it was formulated by elias j. bickerman , `` the first need of any social system is to create incentives to make people do more work than that required by their immediate wants '' @xcite .",
    "the norm game was introduced by axelrod @xcite together with a metanorm game , where punishing for non - punishing was included .",
    "axelrod presented some results of the computer simulations , which were later questioned @xcite . on the other hand , recently reported results on the norm game @xcite relied on a definite sets of values of the model parameters .",
    "it is then difficult to evaluate to what extent these results are generic .",
    "this obstacle is even more painful when we realize that it concerns also the dependence of the results on a particular model , which is many cases is chosen arbitrarily . for a theoretically motivated sociophysicist , the remedy seems to be as follows : build a model as simple as possible , control its assumptions , check how the results depend on the parameters , complications can be introduced only step by step .",
    "this procedure should at least make the model clear to those who deal with real data ; it is also in harmony with warnings , heard from the professional side of sociology @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the arguments given in our first paragraph suggest that maybe the frames of the game theory are too narrow to describe the social entanglement of individual decisions . between the get",
    "as much as you can and the invisible hand of long lasting evolution there is a whole spectrum of motivations , not as rational as in economic world , and more rational from an individual or social point of view than in the biological evolution .",
    "variable external conditions and individual experience play a role there , but their outcome is not fully determined by the expected payoffs . to resolve the puzzle , one should take into account local traditions , norms and social roles distribution - a sociophysicist can not talk much about that .",
    "we treat these aspects as a black box .",
    "our input is the initial distribution of the probabilities of the given strategies ; our output is the time dynamics of these probabilities .",
    "this dynamics is governed by the fundamental or master equations ; this choice seems to be free from the conceptual limitations of the game theory . to maintain the continuity with the problem set by axelrod",
    ", we keep the name `` the norm game '' .    here",
    "we report the results from some models of the norm game which we consider to be as simple as possible , with a minimal number of parameters .",
    "in particular , we reduce chains of reasonings to simple sequences of input and output .",
    "for example , an agent is expected to cease punishment if the cost of punishment is large .",
    "then we introduce only one parameter to describe how one act of punishment reduces the probability of punishing ; doing this , we omit the information of the punishment cost , its utility etc .",
    "the method is analytical , and numerical plots are shown for a visualisation .",
    "actually , our aim is to understand the possibilities of our models .",
    "as the basic model here is the mean field approximation , the model can be termed as mean - field society.    in the following sections , we are going to discuss two models , both of them in two variants . in all cases",
    "the results will be the average percentage of punishers and of those who break the norm .",
    "punishing of those who do not punish is not considered here .",
    "general frames of this model are the same as all models discussed here .",
    "the starting points is the master equation for breaking the norm and for punishing for it .",
    "what is specific here is that we treat these states as statistically independent .",
    "this means in particular , that the amount of those who punish among those who obey the norm and those who break it is the same . intuitively , we could expect that those who break the norm do not punish and the opposite .",
    "policemen who drive drunk provide counterexamples ; however , this case can not be treated as general one .",
    "we start from this model to have a reference point .",
    "let us denote the probability of breaking the norm as @xmath2 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath2 is a solution of the master equation    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the probability of punishing , @xmath5 is the rate of increase of @xmath2 per an agent because of the gain which we get when we break the norm and @xmath6 is the opposite rate because of the inhibiting results of the punishment .",
    "we can term these rates as temptation and punishment. the latter term is proportional to @xmath4 , because a punisher is necessary here .",
    "similarly , the time evolution of @xmath4 is controlled by    @xmath7    where the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is responsible for a reduction of @xmath4 due to the cost of punishing , and the second - for an increase of @xmath4 because of growing vengeance - an irritation , that the norm breaking remains non - punished . to fix the timescale",
    ", we keep @xmath8 from now on ; if we do not , @xmath9 should be substituted by @xmath10 .",
    "it is not clear , if the cost term should depend on @xmath11 or not .",
    "does the willingness to punish decrease in the absence of those who break the norm ? having no clear answer , we consider two versions of the model : ( a1 ) where @xmath12 , ( a2 ) where @xmath13 .",
    "in the case ( a1 ) we get an unique stable solution @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "then the proportion of the observed behaviour of breaking the norm and punishing is @xmath19 , the proportion of breaking the norm and not punishing is @xmath20 and so on .",
    "note that @xmath21 , and in general @xmath22 .    in the case ( a2 )",
    "we have    @xmath23    @xmath24    the latter equation is true also in the case ( a1 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we compare the results of two models ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .",
    "they do not differ much .",
    "+    let us now consider the case when there are two mutually punishing groups @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in each of two models ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) there are four equations instead of two , but they are split into two independent pairs . for example , in the model ( a1 ) we have    @xmath27    @xmath28    plus the same set of equations with the indices @xmath29 interchanged . in this model , those who punish in one group do not contact with those who break the norm in the same group .",
    "the differences between the solutions can appear if the values of the parameters are different .",
    "for example , a reduction of punishing constant @xmath6 of one group by the other  but not the opposite  can leads to a difference between the solutions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the parameters @xmath32 are the same for both groups , such a difference can not be obtained .",
    "now we are going to discuss another model , a simplified version of the one presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "main difference between this and the previous formulations ( a1,a2 ) is that now we do not allow to break the norm and to punish simultaneously .",
    "then , now there are three possible strategies : _",
    "i ) _ to obey the norm and do not punish , _",
    "ii ) _ to obey the norm and punish and _ iii ) _ to break the norm and not punish .",
    "the probabilities of observing these strategies will be denoted as @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "now the normalization condition is @xmath33 . with this condition",
    "we can limit the evolution equations to those for @xmath4 and @xmath11 .    here",
    "again we have two models ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) , what is due to the same opportunity .",
    "the equations of motion are    @xmath34    @xmath35    where as before @xmath12 in ( b1 ) or @xmath13 in ( b2 ) .",
    "we note that in this model we do not allow to switch directly from @xmath4 to @xmath11 or back .",
    "this means that all the processes which contribute to changes of @xmath4 or @xmath11 do contribute to changes of @xmath2 .",
    "the solutions show a bifurcation . in the case (",
    "b1 ) , a new fixed point appears : @xmath36 .",
    "this means that everybody breaks the norm and nobody punishes .",
    "this solution exists in the whole space @xmath37 , but it is stable if and only if @xmath38 , i.e. if the punishment constant is small enough .",
    "there is also another fixed point @xmath39 , but it is never stable .",
    "third solution is    @xmath40    @xmath41    and it is stable if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , out of this range the probability @xmath43 happens to be negative ; then this solution is meaningless .",
    "however , this bifurcation in the two - dimensional space @xmath44 is close to what is termed transcritical bifurcation in the case of one variable @xcite .    in the case ( b2 )",
    ", the fixed point @xmath36 appears again and it is stable in the same range as in ( b1 ) , i.e. when @xmath45 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath46 does not exist .",
    "the other solution is @xmath47 @xmath48 and it is stable and meaningful again if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "as before , we compare the fixed points coordinates in ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) as dependent on the constant @xmath9 ; the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 a. the largest difference is between the curves of @xmath49 ; for ( b1 ) it is linear , and for ( b2 ) - the square root . above @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in both ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) .",
    "once @xmath53 , solutions given by eqs .",
    "( 11,12 ) ( version b1 ) and ( 13,14 ) ( version b2 ) coincide with the branch @xmath36 .",
    "all these solutions lose their stability there .",
    "this means that one of the eigenvalues @xmath54 of the jacobian of partial derivatives of the r.h.s of eqs .",
    "( 9,10 ) is zero at the transition point @xmath36 .",
    "both in ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) , the time of getting equilibrium , defined as @xmath55 , is infinite at the transition point .",
    "our numerical experiment shows , that near the critical point @xmath56 the time of getting the vicinity of the fixed point is remarkably larger for ( b1 ) than for ( b2 ) .",
    "this effect , shown in fig .",
    "2 b , can not be obtained within the standard analysis of the stability ; however , it can be important for applications . in terms of ref .",
    "@xcite , this is a difference which could make a difference .",
    "the case of two mutually punishing groups is described by the equations    @xmath57    @xmath58    where the normalization conditions are @xmath59 for @xmath60 . on the contrary to the models ( a1,a2 )",
    "punishers do contact with the rest of their group .",
    "however , algebraic manipulations show that the fixed points are the same as for the case of one group : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the stability of the fixed points is to be checked from the eigenvalues of the jacobian @xmath64 . in ( b1 ) and at the fixed point @xmath46 the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath65 fulfil the condition @xmath66 ; one solution is always positive .",
    "this means , that the fixed point is never stable . at the fixed point",
    "@xmath67 the secular equation is @xmath68 ; all roots are negative if and only if @xmath69 , what coincides with the case of one group .",
    "the same is true also for ( b2 ) ; the only difference is that the fixed point @xmath46 does not exist .",
    "it seems likely , that the fixed point given by eqs .",
    "( 11,12 ) for ( b1 ) and eqs .",
    "( 13,14 ) for ( b2 ) remains stable also for two groups , if @xmath42 .",
    "this tentative conclusion is confirmed by our computer simulation ; we have not observed any deviation from the stable fixed point .",
    "then again , a difference in the positions of two groups can appear only if the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath9 are different .",
    "we have discussed four models .",
    "the models ( a1,a2 ) contain the assumption that there is no correlation between obeying or breaking the norm and punishing for breaking it . in the models ( b1,b2 )",
    "we assume that the correlation is strong : nobody who breaks the norm can punish . we expect that any real case is placed between these two extremes . the difference between ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) and between ( b1 ) and ( b2 )",
    "is the same : the relaxation of the probability of punishing does ( a1,b1 ) or does not ( a2,b2 ) depend on the probability that the norm is broken .",
    "this difference appears to influence the stationary solution only quantitatively .",
    "when we deal with the social reality , these quantitative details can be of minor importance .",
    "the difference between the models ( a1,a2 ) and ( b1,b2 ) is more serious ; a separate phase appears where the probability of punishment is zero ; on the contrary , nobody preserves the norm .",
    "this stationary solution appears if the punishment is not effective when compared to the gain for breaking the norm and the cost of punishing .",
    "the boundary of this phase in the space of parameters is the condition @xmath70 , as it was discussed in two previous sections .",
    "then the assumption of the correlation between obeying or not the norm and punishing is important for the model results and it would be desirable to check it experimentally before any model is applied to a given norm . despite the differences , some results are the same in all models .",
    "these are : breaking the norm is more frequent when the cost of punishing increases ; simultaneously , the punishment itself is less likely to be observed .",
    "two patterns of behaviour : to break the norm and to punish , discussed above seem to have some organizing power , attracting collective actions of young men and adult professionals .",
    "both need a cooperation . on the contrary , those who just obey norms but",
    "do not punish often prefer individual activities .",
    "in well - ruled countries there is no overlap between robbers and cops , at least in a social scale . in others ,",
    "the power means the ability to break norms and evade being punished .",
    "there , the society is inhomogeneous : some obey norms , some do not , and the behaviour is correlated with a place in the social structure .",
    "we made a step towards modeling this inhomogeneities , when discussing two mutually punishing groups .",
    "our result is that the positions of the groups are different only if their parameters are different .",
    "this fact is reflected in what is observed in political reality , where political parties struggle to make their control from outside ( and punishment ) less effective , exposing simultaneously events when norms are broken by members of rival parties .",
