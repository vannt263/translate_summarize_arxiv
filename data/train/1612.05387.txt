    "in 1998 , leclerc and zelevinsky introduced the notion of weakly separated collections while studying quasicommuting families of quantum minors ( see @xcite ) .",

    ", it motivated the search for other instances of the purity phenomenon .",
    "such instances have been found in @xcite using a novel geometric - combinatorial model called _ combined tilings_. furthermore , the work of @xcite showed that all maximal weakly separated collections can be obtained from each other by a sequence of mutations .",
    "it was also shown by scott  @xcite that collections of plcker coordinates labeled by maximal weakly separated collections form clusters in the cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring of the grassmannian .    in this paper",
    ", we study a new instance of the purity phenomenon for the collection @xmath6 associated with pairs @xmath7 of subsets of @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "such a collection arises naturally when one studies a notion of cluster distance between two cluster variables , and specifically variables that are plcker coordinates in the cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring of the grassmannian .",
    "this purity result allows us to compute this distance for any `` generic '' pair of cluster variables .",
    "we further reformulate this distance in the context of general cluster algebras .",
    "let us first motivate the need for a notion of distance in a cluster algebra , concentrating on the example of the grassmannian .",
    "a pair of plcker coordinates can appear together in the same cluster if and only if they are labeled by weakly separated subsets of @xmath5 $ ] . for plcker",
    "coordinates that _ do not _ appear together in the same cluster , we would like to estimate how close they are to being weakly separated . in a more general sense",
