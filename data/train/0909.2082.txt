    "the origin of magnetism is attributed to the quantum mechanical interaction of particle swhich carry spin . in so - called localized spin systems , the pauli principle plays an essential role and the magnetic interaction is expressed as the heisenberg interaction  @xcite , the exchange integral between atoms being the dominant term . not only the two - spin interaction but also multi - spin interactions may contribute to give rise to exotic magnetic states .",
    "in particular , various effects of the multi - spin interaction have been reported in @xmath2he  @xcite . for itinerant electron systems , the origin of the magnetic order , and of ferromagnetic order in particular , has been studied extensively .",
    "itinerant electron systems are often described by tight binding models such as the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "nagaoka pointed out that the ground state of the hubbard model may be a ferromagnetic state ( nagaoka ferromagnetic state ) if the number of electrons is reduced by one from half - filling  @xcite , where half - filling means that the number of particles is the same as the number of the lattice sites .",
    "the nagaoka ferromagnetic state is established if the so - called `` connectivity condition '' on the lattice is satisfied  @xcite . in the nagaoka",
    "ferromagnetic state , the energy of the system is minimized when the total spin of the system takes the maximum value . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state of the half filled system is a singlet state , that is its total spin is zero .",
    "elsewhere , we have studied how the magnetic state changes between these two states when an electron is removed from the system and demonstrated an adiabatic change between these states  @xcite .",
    "magnetism has primarily been studied in electron systems in which the spin @xmath1 .",
    "however , recently developments in the field of laser - cooled atomic systems have opened new possibilities to realize artificial tight - binding quantum system such as the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to electron systems , in optical lattices the spin of trapped atoms is not necessarily @xmath1 but can take larger half - integer or integer values . in the latter case ,",
    "the system contains bosons , not fermions , and it is therefore of interest to study itinerant magnetism of systems with @xmath0 .",
    "the present paper presents the results of such systems .",
    "we consider a tight binding model of the form = -t_<ij>,m(c_i , m^c_j , m^ + c_j , m^c_i , m^ ) + _ i=1^nu(n_i , m ) , [ model ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation and creation operators of a particle ( fermion or boson depending on its spin ) of the magnetization @xmath5 at a site @xmath6 , respectively , @xmath7 is the number operator n_i , m = c_i , m^c_i , m^ , for the particle of spin @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represents the on - site repulsive interaction . for the system with @xmath1 , we take for @xmath10 the standard form u(n_i , m)=u_0n_i,-1/2n_i,1/2 , and for larger @xmath0 we extend it as u(n_i , m)=u_0 n_i(n_i-1 ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is assumed to be positive . obviously , the interaction @xmath10 increases the energy whenever a site is occupied by more than one particle .    in order to study magnetic properties of the system ,",
    "we introduce spin operators for the magnetization @xmath13 of the particles , where s_i^z=_m =- s^s mn_i , m .",
    "hereafter , we use the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are expressed in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 : s^+_i=_mc_i , m+1^c_i , m^ [ sp ] and s^-_i=_mc_i , m-1^c_i , m^ , [ sm ] where @xmath8 is the total spin of each particle , and @xmath5 is the @xmath16-component of the magnetization . to discuss the magnetic properties of the states , we adopt the usual notation @xmath17 where @xmath8 is the total spin @xmath8 and",

    "more than two particles with the same @xmath5 can occupy the same site and the normalized basis states take the form |=    and @xmath21 and @xmath5 and @xmath22 is not relevant .",
    "the total spin of the whole system is given by ^2=(s^x)^2+(s^y)^2+(s^z)^2=+(s^z)^2 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the value of the total spin of the system by @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "it should be noted that the hubbard hamiltonian conserves number of particles n_m=_i=1^n n_i , m for each @xmath5 . to describe the set of @xmath27 of states , it is convenient to introduce the notation \\{n_m } = ( n_s , n_s-1,,n_-s ) , where @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to note that except for @xmath1 , the operator @xmath29 changes the set @xmath30 .",
    "for example , if @xmath31 application of @xmath29 to states in the set @xmath32 , created states in the set @xmath33 .",
    "thus , except for @xmath1 , the matrix element @xmath34 can be nonzero even if @xmath35 .",
    "thus , even though the hamiltonian @xmath36 has the su(2 ) symmetry , conserves the total spin , and therefore commutes with @xmath37 , the operation of @xmath29 on each state with given @xmath30 must be treated carefully .",
    "let us denote by @xmath38 the ground state in the space with the magnetization @xmath5 . because the hamiltonian @xmath36 and @xmath37 commute with each other",

    "the ground state energies are all different . as @xmath12 increases , the ground state energies of ( 3,1,0,0 ) , ( 2,2,0,0 ) and ( 2,1,1,0 ) become degenerate with that of ( 4,0,0,0 ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the lowest energy state in these sets has the total spin @xmath55 .",
    "however , we find that the lowest energy state in the set ( 1,1,1,1 ) is always lower than that of ( 4,0,0,0 ) .",

    "therefore , the nagaoka - ferromagnetic state , i.e. , the state of the maximum total spin , is not realized as the ground state in the present case even at large values of @xmath12 .    in general , when there are multiple conserved quantities in a system that do not commute with each other , each energy state of the system is usually degenerate as shown in eq .",

    ", we have shown that @xmath46 itinerant particle systems may exhibit nagaoka - ferromagnetism although it is more difficult to satisfy the connectivity condition .",

    "thus , when we create states by applying @xmath68 from the all - up state , we have only the state with @xmath69 for the four spin system . in contrast ,",
    "in the case of @xmath46 , we create different sets by applying @xmath68 . as we mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the created states are degenerate as ground states .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we find again a degenerate ground states with @xmath73 and 0 , which is an intrinsic property of systems with @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , we find that even in the half - filled case , in the boson system the total spin takes the maximum value .",
    "for instance , for a system of four atoms on a simple square lattice ( corresponding to the half - filled case ) , the ground state is the same for all sets @xmath75 ( results not shown ) .",
    "this property of boson systems can be understood as follows .",
    "consider the subspace for a fixed set @xmath47 .",
    "all the off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath36 are @xmath76 or 0 . by substracting an appropriate multiple of the unit matrix ,",
    "also the diagonal elements can be made negative or zero .",
    "thus , all the elements of the shifted matrix @xmath77 are either negative or zero . in our model , all the sites are connected by bonds and therefore there exist a number @xmath78 such that all the elements of @xmath79 are positive .",
    "then , the perron - frobenius theorem tells us that there exist a unique eigenstate of @xmath79 with an eigenvalue that is larger than the absolute value of all other eigenvalues .",
    "this unique eigenstate is therefore the ground state of @xmath80 , is totally symmetric with positive coefficients , and contains the state of the maximum total spin . however , as we mentioned above , this ground state has an intrinsic degeneracy with respect to subspaces that have different @xmath47 because we always start from the state with all spins maximum and let @xmath68 create different sets of @xmath81 .",
    "the states that are generated in this manner have all positive coefficients and are therefore ground states too .",
    "cleary , this property does not depend on the connectivity of the lattice or the value of @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , for fermion systems , it is in general impossible to transform @xmath80 such that all elements have the same sign but in those cases for which such a transformation exist , which is precisely the condition of nagaoka ferromagnetism , we can apply the same arguments as in the boson case to prove that the ground state of @xmath80 is totally symmetric with positive coefficients and contains the state of the maximum total spin .     and the corresponding total spin @xmath25 as a function of @xmath12 for four @xmath31 bosons and various @xmath82 on the lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice5](a ) .",
    "the solid line denotes data for ( 4,0,0 ) , solid triangles : ( 3,1,0 ) , open triangles : ( 3,0,1 ) , open squares : ( 2,2,0 ) , reversed triangles : ( 2,1,1 ) , crosses : ( 1,2,1 ) , and bullets : ( 0,4,0 ) . ]",
    "we have studied the magnetic properties of the ground state of itinerant systems with @xmath83 .",
    "we found that fermion systems ( @xmath46 ) support an extended form of nagaoka ferromagnetism but that the connectivity condition is more difficult to satisfy because of the presence of particles with different magnetization .",
    "when the maximum @xmath25 state is the ground state , the system has a degenerate ground state in each set @xmath47 listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "thus the ground state manifold consists of not only the state of the maximum @xmath25 but also of states with smaller values of @xmath25 .",
    "this degenerate structure is intrinsic for the systems with @xmath0 where several sets of @xmath47 exist for a given value of @xmath5 .    for boson systems ( @xmath31 )",
    "we found that there is a ground state in each set of @xmath47 and that the same type of degenerate ground - state structure appears as the one found for @xmath46 , but in this case regardless of the value of @xmath12 and of the shape of the lattice , which is an intrinsic property of the bosonic case .",
    "thus , we conclude that boson itinerant magnetic systems always have a state with the maximum total spin belonging to the manifold of ground states .",
    "this property follows quite naturally from the fact that the hamiltonian of the boson system can be transformed such that all elements have the same sign , implying that the ground state is fully symmetrized .",
    "in contrast , for fermion systems we need an additional condition , the condition for the nagaoka ferromagetism , for the ground state to have maximum total spin .",
