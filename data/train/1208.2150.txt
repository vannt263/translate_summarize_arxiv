    "the dynamics of the brownian particle is governed by the langevin equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a periodic potential with period @xmath2 ( in each direction ) , @xmath3 denotes a constant external force , so that the effective potential is @xmath4 @xmath5 is the friction coefficient , @xmath6 is the inverse temperature and @xmath7 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath8 .",

    "explicit formulas for these coefficients are available only in the overdamped limit and mostly in one dimension . an exact analytical formula for the effective velocity of an overdamped brownian particle moving in a one dimensional tilted periodic potential",

    "it is well known that the equilibrium diffusion coefficient ( i.e. , the diffusion coefficient in the absence of an external drift ) and the drift , or , rather , the mobility are related through the famous einstein formula : @xmath13 with @xmath14 the validity of this formula has been proved rigorously for several models  @xcite , including that of a brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential  @xcite .",

    "the generator and fokker - planck operator of this process are still given by formulas   and   but now restricted on @xmath46 , with periodic boundary conditions with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath48 is an ergodic markov process with invariant measure @xmath49 that has a smooth density @xmath50 with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath46 .",
    "the invariant density is the unique solution of the stationary fokker - planck equation on @xmath46 : @xmath51 the drift is then given by the average of the momentum with respect to @xmath52 over @xmath46 : @xmath53    the diffusion coefficient is given by the formula    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the solution of the poisson equation @xmath56 equations   and   are equipped with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath47 and suitable integrability conditions  @xcite .",
    "formula  , which shows that the effective diffusion tensor is positive semidefinite , follows from   after an integration by parts .",
    "it is possible to prove that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are analytic functions of the forcing @xmath15 .",
    "this has been proved for the drift in  @xcite ( in fact , in this paper the analyticity of the drift with respect to the forcing is proved for several models including systems of coupled fokker ",
    "planck equations ) . a similar analysis can be used to prove the analytic dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath15 .",
    "in this section we solve perturbatively equations   and   in one dimension , in order to obtain the power series expansions  . calculations of this form are quite standard when investigating the effect of colored noise on the drift and diffusion coefficients , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "related calculations have presented recently in  @xcite .    the main result of this section is a precise formulation of proposition  [ prop : main ] .",
    "to state the result , we need to introduce some notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the hamiltonian of the unperturbed ( equilibrium ) dynamics  : @xmath58 the invariant density of the unperturbed dynamics on @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath59 : @xmath60 we will work in the weighted @xmath36 space @xmath61 .",
    "the inner product in this hilbert space will be denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "the generator of the unperturbed dynamics can be written in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 denote the reversible and irreversible parts , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are antisymmetric and symmetric , respectively , in @xmath67 .",
    "we introduce now the creation and annihilation operators  @xcite @xmath68 these two operators are @xmath67-adjoint : @xmath69    [ prop : detailed ] the drift and diffusion coefficients admit the asymptotic expansions @xmath70 and    @xmath71 \\\\ & = & \\beta^{-1 } \\frac{d u}{df } + \\sum_{\\ell \\geq 1 } f^{\\ell } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\ell } \\xi_{n \\ell}. \\label{e : deff_coeffs2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the coefficients @xmath72 are given by the formulas    @xmath73    where @xmath74 are solutions to the ( adjoint ) poisson equations    [ e : ll * ] @xmath75    we have used the notation @xmath76 to denote the @xmath67-adjoint of the generator @xmath77 .    the expansion formulas for the drift and velocity are consistent with the exact statistical reflection symmetry @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 in the stochastic system   or infinitesmal generator   when the potential is symmetric : @xmath81 .",
    "since the drift is odd and the diffusivity even under reflection , this implies that the coefficients @xmath82 when @xmath26 is even and the coefficients @xmath25 when @xmath26 is odd .",
    "one can verify that our formulas do indeed have these vanishing properties under symmetry of the potential , noting that the operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 are odd under reflection , whereas @xmath85 and @xmath86 are even . by uniqueness of solutions of the poisson equations   and the symmetry properties of the operators , inhomogeneity , and auxiliary conditions , we first verify by induction that the functions @xmath87 have even reflection symmetry for even @xmath88 and odd reflection symmetry for odd @xmath88 .",
    "then we similarly induce that the functions @xmath89 have odd reflection symmetry for even @xmath90 and even reflection symmetry for odd @xmath88 . finally , @xmath91   has manifestly even symmetry under reflection symmetry .",
    "therefore , when @xmath26 is even , @xmath92 can be checked to be the periodic integral of an odd function and when @xmath26 is odd , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are periodic integrals of odd functions , and so vanish .    using the notation that we have introduced in this section , einstein s formula ( linear response theory ) can be written in the form @xmath95 however , formula   shows that it is not true that a similar simple relation holds for higher order terms in the expansions for the drift and the diffusion coefficients .",
    "in particular , * it is not true * that @xmath96 but instead there is a non - trivial correction to   that is given by the second term on the right hand side of  . as an example",
    ", we present the formula for the diffusion coefficient that is valid up to @xmath97 : @xmath98 notice that the calculation of the next two terms in the expansion for the diffusion coefficient requires the solution of an additional poisson equation , in order to compute @xmath99 , as well as the calculation of three additional integrals .    similarly ,",
    "* it is not true * that the einstein relation   can be extended away from @xmath100 in the form : @xmath101 because of the presence of correction terms in eq .  .",
    "this issue is investigated numerically in the next section , see figures  [ u_linear_response ] and  [ d_linear_response ] .",
    "the relation eq .",
    "was indeed hypothesized in  @xcite , but  @xcite showed through analytical and numerical studies that while it seems qualitatively correct , and is quantitatively correct in the three limits @xmath21 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , it is not quantitatively accurate for general parameter values .",
    "our results in proposition  [ prop : detailed ] give quantitative formulas for this discrepancy , for example , through third order : @xmath104    the violation of the einstein relation for @xmath105 in the model under consideration , and other nonequilibrium steady - state models , was recently analyzed by  @xcite from a different nonperturbative perspective , expressing the correction terms with respect to various time - correlation functions of the dynamics .",
    "but as we discuss in appendix  [ sec : appmaes ] , our framework based on perturbation expansions of the equations from homogenization theory appear to yield more easily computable expressions .",
    "we remark also that  @xcite have examined deviations from the einstein relation in the context of stochastic tracer dynamics in a random environment .",
