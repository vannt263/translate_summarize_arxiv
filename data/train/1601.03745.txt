    ", the topological part pertains to the presence of time - reversal conjugate pairs of boundary states that are robust , that is , stable against perturbations that do not break the protecting symmetry . in ti s ,",
    "the transition between a topologically trivial and a non - trivial phase is usually described in terms of band inversion , where the gap between two energy bands closes and creates an avoided crossing hosting the protected boundary states .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in hgte quantum wells , for example , which undergo a topological phase transition as a function of quantum well thickness @xcite .",
    "these edge modes have been detected through transport measurements @xcite . in the three dimensional case , the boundary modes are also conveniently described spectroscopically using arpes @xcite . however , a thermodynamic description of topological boundary states is missing .",
    "a problem one encounters is that band topology is determined for infinite , translationally invariant systems in terms of bloch hamiltonians @xcite , whereas the edge states of the system are only found in finite systems with boundaries .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence describes this connection between band topology and edge states .",
    "if one tries to apply the thermodynamic formalism to topological phases of matter , one immediately discovers that there is no thermodynamic bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "the thermodynamic potentials only depend on the energy levels of the hamiltonian and the density of states , while the topology of the bands depends on the eigenstates : two models can have the same spectrum in the bulk , but different topological characteristics .",
    "since in conventional thermodynamics the energy is additive with respect to the extensive variables like entropy @xmath0 , volume @xmath1 , and particle number @xmath2 , the thermodynamic contribution of the edge states is lost in the conventional thermodynamic limit .    in this work , we show that the solution to this conundrum lies in hill s refinement of conventional thermodynamics @xcite . as computed from statistical mechanics , the thermodynamic potentials ( entropy or any of the various free energies ) do not typically scale linearly with the extensive variables of the system due to finite size and boundary effects . in order to account for this feature within the thermodynamic framework",
    ", hill collects the deviations from linear scaling in a new state function , the subdivision potential . to show how this works",
    ", we first give the necessary details from hill s thermodynamics in sec .",
    "we then discuss in sec .",
    "[ gibbs ] how this relates to the more traditional method of treating boundary effects due to gibbs . finally , in sec .",
    "[ app ] we apply the developed theory to the bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model for hgte quantum wells , to show how this works in practice .",
    "our main results are presented in sec .",
    "[ res ] : we show that the thermodynamic density of states and the specific heat signatures of the topological edge states can be experimentally detected .",
    "moreover , we find that the topological phase transition is accompanied by a thermodynamic phase transition on the boundary of the system that has no counterpart in conventional thermodynamics .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in sec .",
    "let us consider a finite system of size @xmath1 , in contact with an environment at temperature @xmath3 and electronic chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "we take the extensive variable @xmath1 to be the number of sites in the lattice associated to a tight - binding model of a ti .",
    "formally , @xmath1 must be a fluctuating parameter , which can be achieved by considering a reservoir of ions capable of becoming attached to the lattice .",
    "then , conjugate to @xmath1 there is a variable @xmath5 characterizing the thermodynamic response of the band structure to an increase in the number of lattice sites .",
    "if it is not a fluctuating parameter , but then one would formally be comparing different thermodynamic systems , which is experimentally more feasable , but theoretically inelegant . ]    for a system with these independent state variables , one uses the grand potential @xmath6 . in hill s thermodynamics , it still obeys the conventional relation @xmath7 as in ordinary thermodynamics .",
    "hence , the connection with the microscopic behaviour is made through the statistical - mechanical partition function , @xmath8\\right\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath9 denoting the boltzmann constant and @xmath10 the hamiltonian of the ti .",
    "however , the differential equation for @xmath6 does not integrate to @xmath11 by way of euler s theorem because non - linear scaling with the extensive variable @xmath1 is allowed within hill s framework . the new thermodynamic variable @xmath12 determines the subdivision potential @xmath13 as @xmath14 hill thermodynamics was originally developed for small systems , where highly non - linear thermodynamic potentials are computed by considering an independent ensemble of such systems @xcite .",
    "the approach also works if the individual small systems are not independent , since it allows for a systematic computation of potentials from statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "interestingly , hill thermodynamics is just as necessary for systems as large as gravitationally bound systems @xcite , where conventional thermodynamics fails to apply because the gravitational force is long - ranged and universally attractive .",
    "topologically non - trivial states of electronic matter belong to neither one of these categories .",
    "what makes the subdivision potential important for ti s is the strong dependence of the spectrum on the boundary conditions , due to the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "since the boundary is small compared to the bulk , systems with a strong behavioural dependence on boundary conditions are in a sense small themselves , and hence hill s thermodynamics is the natural framework to describe them .",
    "a recurring theme in this work , is that hill thermodynamics describes features in topological insulators that can not be described by effective boundary theories . in order to shed further light on this statement",
    ", we now give a detailed description of the hill formalism .",
    "we then contrast this approach to the traditional gibbs method of effective boundary theories .",
    "finally , we indicate where the gibbs method breaks down in the case of topological insulators , and why .",
    "the basic physical assumption in thermodynamics is the thermodynamic identity @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote , respectively , temperature , pressure and chemical potential .",
    "it relates the average energy , which completely determines the system , to the thermodynamic variables .",
    "conventional thermodynamics assumes the energy to be extensive ; however , it is unable to describe the non - local behaviour of topological phase transitions . if one relaxes extensiveness , eq .",
    "is no longer straightforwardly integrated . nevertheless , hill realised that this problem may be overcome in a very astute manner : consider a macroscopic number @xmath17 of independent copies of the system , and allow this number of copies to vary .",
    "the thermodynamic identity for the total system then reads @xmath18 where the subscript @xmath19 stands for the total system , @xmath1 is the volume of an individual subsystem , and @xmath20 is a formal thermodynamic response of the system to changes in @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath21 might well depend on @xmath1 itself , but the leading term in @xmath22 should be linear in @xmath1 .",
    "now , we consider the total system at fixed @xmath23 and since @xmath24 must be linear in @xmath17 , using euler s theorem we can integrate eq .",
    "to get @xmath25 the energy of an individual system may be obtained by dividing eq .   by @xmath26 using that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , this gives @xmath29 .",
    "this result holds for any @xmath30 system , and we have actually integrated eq .   for this case . the non - extensive behaviour is naturally incorporated since @xmath21 can depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the deviations of hill s thermodynamics can be naturally separated from the conventional formalism by writing @xmath31 here , @xmath32 defines hill s subdivision potential ; it is an extra degree of freedom that characterises the non - extensiveness of the system .    by inserting the ansatz @xmath33 into the hill formalism , as in the main text",
    ", we are clearly separating the bulk from the boundary effects in the free energy .",
    "gibbs has also developed a method to describe boundary effects in thermodynamics , which was originally used to describe classical fluids @xcite , and will also be used in this work . in 1878 , gibbs described a thermodynamic approach to surface tension relying on the hypothesis that bulk and boundary could be treated as independent systems in some approximate sense . in gibbs approach ,",
    "the free energy of the fluid system acquires a term proportional to a suitable power ( e.g. @xmath34 ) of the volume . the phenomenological success of gibbs approach is remarkable , since there is no sharp surface associated to any actual microscopic fluid system .    in gibbs approach , based on conventional thermodynamics ,",
    "the area of the boundary has to be an extensive thermodynamic variable in itself .",
    "this implies that one treats the surface of the system as a separate thermodynamic system with its own energetics , independent from the bulk .",
    "consider , for example , a bulk system @xmath35 with a boundary @xmath36 .",
    "the bulk system will have energy @xmath37 and the boundary has its own energy @xmath38 applying the equations of thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the total energy @xmath41 reads @xmath42 considering the grand potential @xmath43 for both subsystems , and defining the total grand potential @xmath44 , we obtain @xmath45 because the bulk and the boundary are separate systems , with their own grand potential , the thermodynamic identity reads @xmath46 this is crucially different from the hill approach : although hill also uses eq .  , the thermodynamic identity is still given by eq .  ,",
    "which does not contain the @xmath47 term , so that the bulk and boundary are thermodynamically connected in a natural way . in this case , the @xmath48 term and possible additional terms define the subdivision potential @xmath13 .",
    "it is also possible to consider the bulk and boundary as a connected system in the gibbs approach . in that case",
    ", one writes @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 by using this identity , eq .",
    "becomes formally equivalent to the standard thermodynamic identity .",
    "however , the starting point is fundamentally different , and writing @xmath49 is tantamount to distilling a boundary theory from the total hamiltonian .",
    "it does mean that if a sensible boundary theory can be written down , the gibbs and hill approaches will yield the same results .",
    "this coincidence is a powerful tool in analysing topological boundary effects .",
    "although the subdivision potential @xmath13 , and hence the boundary behaviour , can be obtained from @xmath6 by looking at the different volume scalings , there is no clear way to separate finite - size effects from topological behaviour .",
    "however , there is a natural way to define a boundary theory for non - trivial topological insulators : diagonalise the hamiltonian , and single out boundary states based on the localisation of the eigenfunctions .",
    "we will find that this effective theory is a powerful tool in interpreting our results when applicable .",
    "however , it is hill s thermodynamics that allows one to find the regime where this is so .",
    "the above procedure for writing down an effective theory works precisely if the linear regime from eq .",
    "has set in .",
    "as we discuss in the next section , the minimum width @xmath51 for which this holds is dependent on the gap size .",
    "this occurs because the edge states merge into the bulk at the phase transition , and an effective theory can only be expected to hold if the system is larger than the decay length of the edge states .",
    "alternatively , the low energy theory becomes conformally invariant at the topological phase transition , so an ansatz of the form eq",
    ".   can not be correct .",
    "however , for systems larger than a floating cutoff width @xmath52 depending on the gap size , we get eq .   as a generalised thermodynamic limit .",
    "this thermodynamic limit is equivalent to a gibbs effective theory , hence , such an effective gibbs theory can describe the low temperature thermodynamic responses as long as the gap remains large enough . however , if one wants to correctly describe the phase transition , one needs to keep the system size above the floating cutoff , which can be done naturally in the hill thermodynamics by looking at the scaling , but not using an effective theory , since it is not clear precisely when an edge state has merged into the bulk .",
    "we will now apply the developed formalism to the paradigmatic bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model of hgte / cdte quantum wells @xcite .",

    "the system is in a topologically non - trivial phase , whereas for @xmath64 the gap is trivial .",
    "we consider a ribbon with a finite width @xmath51 and a length @xmath65 ( so that @xmath66 ) , and impose the corresponding boundary conditions on eq .  .",
    "then , we calculate the grand potential @xmath67 numerically according to eq .  .",
    "the subdivision potential is extracted from the ansatz @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is essentially the subdivision potential of the bhz model .",
    "a linear fit is then performed in @xmath51 , to obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the given values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "one can obtain @xmath71 and @xmath70 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 by evaluating them on a grid , and interpolating .",
    "we let one single parameter vary , while keeping all others constant , and we use one - dimensional hermite interpolation .",
    "our results indicate that the above ansatz correctly describes the relevant features of the model for large @xmath51 , but the interested reader is referred to the supplementary material for a detailed error analysis of the fitting procedure .",
    "the parameters @xmath72 are fixed for numerical convenience and clarity in the results . from eq .  , it is readily derived that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which indeed become equal as @xmath75 , as expected for large systems .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that @xmath70 can not be neglected for topologically non - trivial systems , showing that eq .",
    "defines a generalised thermodynamic limit , appropriate for topological insulators with boundary .",
    "using the thermodynamic identity , various thermodynamic responses can be calculated , and due to eq .  ,",
    "these naturally split into a boundary and a bulk contribution . in fig .",

    "+    our data show clearly that @xmath84 vanishes in the energy gap @xmath85 both in the topological and in the trivial phase .",
    "however , due to the presence of edges , there is also a non - vanishing contribution @xmath86 . to interpret this contribution , it is important to note that @xmath70 contains not just the topological edge states , but also other finite size effects , as evidenced by the finite value of @xmath70 even if @xmath64 . outside the gap ,",
    "non - topological finite size effects are dominated by the discreteness of the spectrum , and @xmath86 is essentially just noise .",
    "the noise becomes reduced in magnitude for non - zero temperatures , which smooths out the discreteness of the spectrum , or by fitting eq .",
    "( [ hillpotential ] ) to a larger range of @xmath51 values .",
    "on the other hand , the energy spectrum of the edge states is much less dependent on the width @xmath51 , and not subject to noise . inside the gap ,",
    "@xmath87 and the scaling of the density of states with @xmath51 vanishes , making @xmath86 the only term for all system sizes . in this case",
    ", it can be interpreted as the density of topological edge states , since finite - size effects only show up in combination with bulk behaviour .",
    "indeed , the dirac states at the edge disperse with @xmath88 @xcite , yielding a dos of @xmath89 at @xmath77 according to the gibbs approach ; the line @xmath90 ( obtained by putting @xmath91 ) has been added in yellow in fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) .    to first order in @xmath3 , the heat capacity behaves as @xmath92 since",
    "a dirac fermion has conformal charge @xmath93 @xcite . hence , to linear order the bulk @xmath94 necessarily vanishes at low temperatures for @xmath77 .",
    "however , while we expect the boundary @xmath95 to vanish at low temperatures in the trivial phase at @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) ) , for the topological phase with @xmath83 the specific heat amounts to @xmath96 , which can be obtained by simply substituting @xmath97 into eq .",
    "( [ heatcap ] ) . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ f1](d ) , we observe a linear scaling of @xmath95 at low temperatures . in the inset , the yellow line with slope",
    "@xmath98 has been added to confirm that the low temperature heat capacity derives from the edge states .    in both of these cases , the @xmath70 term in eq .",
    "( [ hillpotential ] ) could not be dropped because a derivative of @xmath71 vanished , and hence the contribution from @xmath70 became dominant .",
    "this shows that for edge effects to become irrelevant , it is not only required that @xmath99 , but that this also holds for all derivatives .",
    "there is another situation where the derivatives of @xmath100 fail to converge , which is if a phase transition occurs at the boundary . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we depict the behaviour of the thermodynamic potential in terms of the parameter @xmath62 that controls the topological phase transitions in the bhz model . in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) , @xmath101 is shown , which exhibits a slightly smoothed kink at @xmath102 .",
    "this smoothing is precisely as large as the sample spacing in @xmath62 from which we interpolated to obtain the graph , indicating that it is a numerical artefact . the inlay shows @xmath103 , which is discontinuous at @xmath102 .",
    "calculating the same graph for the system on an infinite plane yields the same behaviour , except that the kink is sharper .",
    "therefore , the closing of the band gap is detected by the bulk free energy and characterised as a third - order phase transition .",
    "it is reminiscent of a lambda phase transition , and the divergence occurs in the non - topological regime .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [ f2](b ) shows that @xmath104 exhibits a kink .",
    "the inlay shows that the transition is again of lambda type , with the divergence occurring in the non - topological regime , but this time the order is different : the edge undergoes a second - order phase transition .",
    "this phase transition can not be described by an effective boundary theory through the gibbs method , as can be seen because the divergence is at the trivial side , where there are no edge states .",
    "this occurs because the phase transition is driven by the merging of the topological edge states into the bulk .",
    "the precise moment when an edge state ceases to be an edge state can not be determined from its localisation . however , any contribution to the free energy coming from topological states should scale with the edge length of the system . as such ,",
    "even if we do not precisely know which states are edge states , @xmath70 naturally captures how many there are in total .",
    "therefore , it is not the presence of the edge states that determines the boundary scaling , but the boundary scaling that determines the edge states .",
    "+    the absence of a sensible boundary theory might cause doubt whether @xmath70 truly detects a thermodynamic phase transition related to the appearance of topological edge states , rather than an echo of the bulk phase transition .",
    "this issue can be clarified by adding an on - site superconducting pairing to the bhz - model .",
    "the same effect and results would be obtained from induced superconductivity on the edge @xcite .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian for this system is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the hamiltonian from eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) and @xmath107 is the superconducting pairing parameter . adding superconducting pairing has added particle - hole symmetry to the system ; the bulk stays gapped , but now the gapless edge states acquire a mass @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "since the gap does not close , @xmath71 is a smooth function of @xmath107 , and no phase transition occurs in the bulk .",
    "however , the subdivision potential @xmath70 detects the opening of the mass gap for the dirac electrons at the edge as a continuous boundary phase transition .",

    "[ f3 ] , where @xmath108 is shown in red .",
    "a clear divergence is present in @xmath108 at @xmath109 , where the particle - hole symmetry is broken .    because adding a cooper pairing does not merge edge states into the bulk , but only gives them a mass , it is possible to describe a phase transition in @xmath107 using an effective boundary theory in the manner of gibbs , and thereby confirm our interpretation",
    "this theory reads @xmath110 with a momentum cutoff @xmath111 ( since @xmath112 , the edge states exist only for this range of @xmath113 values ) .",

    "our general scheme for extracting thermodynamic signatures of the bulk - boundary correspondence , illustrated here for the paradigmatic bhz model of the quantum - spin hall effect in hgte / cdte quantum wells , comprises a novel tool kit for detecting these elusive states of matter in terms of equilibrium measurements .",
    "the scheme is based on the idea that for topologically non - trivial systems , a non - conventional thermodynamic limit exists : even though the system becomes infinitely large , the boundary is always present .",
    "the boundary is taken into account as in eq .",
    "( [ hillpotential ] ) , in terms of the subdivision potential at the heart of hill thermodynamics .",
    "the subdivision potential captures thermodynamic signatures unique to topological insulators , including a dos in the bandgap observable in transport measurements @xcite , and a contribution to the electronic heat capacity , linear for the bhz model .",
    "most notably , this contribution might be relevant for identifying topological phases in ultracold - atom systems , where transport experiments are challenging and the absence of phonons makes the measurement of fermionic heat capacity easier .",
    "although the edge contributions to the density of states and the specific heat can be captured by an effective model that artificially separates the bulk and the boundary contributions , the same does not hold when describing generic topological phase transitions . if a system undergoes a phase transition within the same symmetry class , the bandgap necessarily closes and a bulk phase transition takes place .",
    "the appearance / disappearance of topologically protected edge states gives rise to an accompanying boundary phase transition , which can only be classified by the subdivision potential , and does not need to be of the same order as the one in the bulk . furthermore , one also observes phase transitions between different symmetry classes , which occur without a closing of the bulk gap . in this case , the topological phase transition occurs solely at the boundary .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 detects a phase transition even if the bulk gap does not close shows that the subdivision potential describes the edge behaviour of the system .",

    "<S> topological insulators are states of matter distinguished by the presence of symmetry protected metallic boundary states . </S>",
    "<S> these edge modes have been characterised in terms of transport and spectroscopic measurements , but a thermodynamic description has been lacking . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge arises because in conventional thermodynamics the potentials are required to scale linearly with extensive variables like volume , which does not allow for a general treatment of boundary effects . in this paper , we overcome this challenge with hill thermodynamics . in this extension of the thermodynamic formalism , </S>",
    "<S> the grand potential is split into an extensive , conventional contribution , and the subdivision potential , which is the central construct of hill s theory . for topologically non - trivial electronic matter , </S>",
    "<S> the subdivision potential captures measurable contributions to the density of states and the heat capacity : it is the thermodynamic manifestation of the topological edge structure </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore , the subdivision potential reveals phase transitions of the edge even when they are not manifested in the bulk , thus opening a variety of new possibilities for investigating , manipulating , and characterizing topological quantum matter solely in terms of equilibrium boundary physics . </S>"
