    "the experimental study of vertical transport through a semiconductor quantum dot @xcite have stressed the similarities of these small electronic systems with real atoms .",
    "shell effects ( in a confinement potential which is approximately parabolic in shape ) and spin effects are clearly distinguished in the positions of conductance peaks @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a relatively strong magnetic field , @xmath0 , makes possible to measure spin reordering with @xmath0 up to the formation of a completely polarized electronic droplet @xcite .",
    "the technique has also revealed its power as a spectroscopic tool in the determination of the low - lying energy levels of the few - electron dots @xcite .",
    "more recent developments include integer spin kondo effects @xcite , and the study of two - electron tunneling in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "the position of conductance peaks , obtained from the experiments , determine addition energies and even excitation energies to the first excited states , if they are well separated from the rest of the states .",
    "this only happens for the few - electron dots and for the very first excited states . in the six - electron dot ,",
    "for example , at excitation energies around 1 mev , the density of states may be as high as 80 levels / mev .",
    "that is , mean level distance around 0.012 mev ( see section iii ) . in the present paper , we show that for relatively small dots and excitation energies @xmath1 1 mev , the density of states can be obtained from a precise measurement of the height and position of the conductance peak at the upper edges of the coulomb blockade diamonds .",
    "we present model calculations for a 6-electron dot in a magnetic field @xmath2 t. our model parameters are chosen to approximate the experimental conditions in papers .",
    "the relatively strong magnetic field guarantees that only spin - polarized states are relevant in tunneling processes . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature is low enough ( a few mk ) for thermal excitation to be neglected . thus a pure quantum mechanical description is used .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the details of the model quantum dot are specified in section ii . in the next section ,",
    "the low - lying energy levels of the 6- and 7-electron dots are computed , and the density of levels at low excitation energies is parametrized with a single `` temperature '' parameter .",
    "we show that this parameter depends very weakly on the magnetic field .",
    "the calculation of the linear magneto - conductance ( transmission coefficient ) is sketched in section iv . in section",
    "v , we show how the conductance at maxima can be related to the density of energy levels , and we compare the estimate following from the conductance with the actual ( calculated ) density of states .",
    "a schematic representation of the vertical profile ( @xmath3 axis ) of the bottom of the conduction band for the model structure to be used is given in fig .",
    "this is a symmetric algaas(7 nm)-ingaas(12 nm)-algaas(7 nm ) quantum well , with n - doped source ( s ) and drain ( d ) contacts @xcite . the quantum dot is formed within the well region . for the smallest dots ,",
    "the lateral ( @xmath4 ) confinement is approximately parabolic , with @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "the source potential will be taken as the reference potential .",
    "it will be fixed to zero .",
    "the barrier height due to the al concentration is estimated in ref . as 50 mev .",
    "we will add 42 mev corresponding to the coulomb barrier ( 6 electrons times 7 mev ) .",
    "thus , the top of the left barrier is at 92 mev , and for the right barrier at ( 92-@xmath6 ) mev ( @xmath7 and @xmath6 are in fact energies , not voltages ) .",
    "the drain potential is @xmath8 .",
    "notice that our @xmath7 parameter is not the one used in experiments . in our model ,",
    "the depth of the potential well is @xmath9 , while in experiments @xmath7 is related to the depth of the well through the capacitance of the system .",
    "the electron mass and dielectric constant are taken as @xmath10 and 12.5 respectively all over the structure . in the computation of the @xmath11-electron states in the dot",
    ", a first quantum well sub - band approximation is used .",
    "the energy of the first quantum well state , @xmath12 , is computed numerically as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "the total energy is then written    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is obtained from a two - dimensional calculation which includes the lateral confinement and the effective coulomb potential ( equal to 0.8 times the two - dimensional potential to account for averaging in the @xmath3 direction ) .",
    "magnetic field values around 10 t are considered . in this region ,",
    "the electronic droplet is completely spin polarized @xcite .",
    "moreover , the separation between landau levels ( ll ) is @xmath15 mev , where @xmath0 is measured in teslas .",
    "thus , the second ll is around 17 mev above the first .",
    "if we are interested in excitation energies below 1mev , we may neglect contributions from the second and higher ll s @xcite . in section iii , a large basis of slater first ll functions",
    "is used to construct the two - dimensional matrix hamiltonian , which is further diagonalized by means of a lanczos algorithm .    in section iv , we will compute the transmission coefficient of the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which the potential is sectionally constant , unlike a real structure .",
    "in the present section , we show results for the spin - polarized energy levels of the 6- and 7-electron dots .",
    "the starting point is the `` first ll '' @xmath16 hamiltonian    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the cyclotronic frequency , and @xmath19 .",
    "the sum runs over indexes , @xmath20 , representing angular momentum projection onto the @xmath3 axis .",
    "@xmath21 creates one electron in a harmonic oscillator state of frequency @xmath22 with zero radial quantum number and @xmath23 .",
    "the zeeman energy is not included .",
    "the constant @xmath24 equals @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the harmonic oscillator length , and @xmath27  the dielectric constant .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 is diagonalized in a basis of slater determinants with fixed angular momentum projection @xmath28 . for a given @xmath29 ,",
    "this basis is finite . in a 7-electron system , for example",
    ", the sector with @xmath30 contains 40340 functions .",
    "these large matrices are better diagonalized with a lanczos algorithm .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the lowest energy levels ( excitation energy @xmath1 1 mev ) for the @xmath31 and 7-electron dots in magnetic fields @xmath32 and 12 t. a few remarkable facts are evident from this figure .",
    "the average number of levels , @xmath33 , with excitation energies @xmath34 may be very well fitted by a `` constant temperature approximation '' @xcite    @xmath35    the temperature parameter , @xmath36 , exhibits a weak dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "when @xmath0 varies from 8.75 to 12 t , for example , @xmath37 for the 6-electron dot changes only from 2.99 to 3.20 ( mev)@xmath38 . in the language of `` filling factors '' , @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the momentum corresponding to filling factor one ) , one has @xmath41 at @xmath32 t , and @xmath42 for @xmath43 t. the gap to the first excited state shrinks to zero at the @xmath0 values where the ground - state momentum , @xmath44 , changes first from -35 to -39 , and then from -39 to -45 .",
    "@xmath36 , however , varies very weakly .",
    "it means that @xmath36 is not a measure of this gap , but of the actual low - lying density of levels .    the average density of levels following from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is    @xmath45    which may be taken as a smooth version of the actual density    @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the excitation energy of the @xmath48-th level . for @xmath31 and @xmath43 t ,",
    "for example , the average density is around 80 levels / mev at @xmath49=1 mev .",
    "we will compute the conductance , @xmath50 , from the transmission coefficient , @xmath51 , by means of a simplified landauer expression @xcite    @xmath52    only one spin polarization is considered in ( [ eq6 ] ) due to the quenching of the spin - down states by the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath51 is computed from the usual relation between transmitted and incident current in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the fact that there is only one electron tunneling through the structure allows one to write an ansatz for the total wave function in which @xmath11 electrons are permanently confined inside the dot .",
    "we restrict our attention to 6 confined , and a seventh tunneling electron .",
    "thus , we shall work in the interval of @xmath7 values corresponding to the n=6 coulomb blockade diamond of fig .",
    "we shall focus on the first conductance peak when @xmath6 is varied , i. e. the edge of the diamond .    as mentioned above , only spin polarized states are considered .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "initial states for the tunneling processes are states with @xmath11 electrons in the dot and one free electron in the source electrode .",
    "the energy is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "contributions to the trasmission coefficient come from intermediate states of @xmath53 electrons in the dot , and final states with @xmath11 electrons in the dot and one electron in the drain , which energy is less or equal than the energy given in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "as we are interested in the first conductance peak when @xmath6 is increased , only one intermediate state contributes , i. e. the ground state of @xmath53 electrons in the dot . in a strong magnetic field , this is a spin polarized state .",
    "the long spin - relaxation times in quantum dots due to phase space reduction @xcite , make spin - flip processes in the final stage of tunneling impossible .",
    "thus , relevant final states are also spin polarized .",
    "the total wave function is written in a separable way : @xmath54 .",
    "the ansatz for the @xmath3 function is the following :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the first quantum well function .",
    "we will determine the combination @xmath57 in each @xmath3 interval where the @xmath3-potential is sectionally constant .",
    "for @xmath58 , a fock representation will be used .",
    "we will simplify the notation further , writing @xmath59 instead of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 will denote the ground state .",
    "then , the ansatz for the wave function is the following    \\(1 ) @xmath64 :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 , and the total energy is written ( apart from trivial constants ) as    @xmath67    @xmath68 is the initial kinetic energy of the tunneling electron",
    ". we will fix it at a small value , @xmath69 mev .",
    "@xmath70 is the @xmath71 creation operator for an electron with angular momentum projection @xmath72 in s. due to the assumed cylindrical symmetry , the total angular momentum , @xmath73 is a conserved quantity .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath74 :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 mev is the barrier height .",
    "\\(3 ) @xmath79 :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "\\(4 ) @xmath83 :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . finally ,    \\(5 ) @xmath87 :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the sum in ( [ eq13 ] ) runs over open final state channels , i. e.    @xmath91    in the above formulae , @xmath92 nm and @xmath93 nm are the barrier and well widths respectively .",
    "notice that our ansatz for @xmath94 respects a weak version of the pauli principle , but it is not completely antisymmetrized with respect to the seventh electron .",
    "the continuity of the current leads to relations among the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the different regions . with our ansatz , however , we found impossible to satisfy the continuity relations for general linear combinations of intermediate or final states .",
    "it means that we shall compute the transmission coefficient for each pair @xmath97 independently",
    ". we will refer to the pair @xmath97 as a tunneling channel",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the @xmath98 channels , where the intermediate state is the ground state of @xmath53 electrons in the dot .",
    "the upper edge of the @xmath31 coulomb blockade diamond in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b is related to these channels .",
    "notice that the absence of interference between tunneling channels should be further reinforced by temperature effects .",
    "note also that overlapping coefficients of transversal ( @xmath99 ) functions cancel out in ratios @xmath100 , and thus in @xmath51 .",
    "the partial transmission coefficient , @xmath101 is defined as usual    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the incident current , and @xmath104 is the transmitted current when only the @xmath105 channel is considered open . the total transmission coefficient is obtained from charge conservation arguments .",
    "if there are a few open channels , then @xmath106 is the current flowing through channel 1 , @xmath107 is the current through channel 2 , etc .",
    "the total coefficient is then    @xmath108",
    "we show in fig . [ fig3]a the partial transmission coefficient , @xmath109 corresponding to the excited state @xmath110 at excitation energy @xmath111 mev in a magnetic field @xmath43 t. this channel is closed for @xmath112 mev , as expected .",
    "three situations are depicted : below resonance ( @xmath113 mev ) , maximum resonance ( @xmath114 mev ) , and above resonance ( @xmath115 mev ) .",
    "the asymptotic shape of the curve below resonance is typical . in nuclear physics context , it is interpreted as interference between resonance and potential scattering @xcite .",
    "the maximum resonance occurs at a @xmath6 slightly higher than @xmath116 .",
    "note that , as the incident electron energy is fixed , the maximum of @xmath109 is not one , but a value around 0.85 . above resonance ,",
    "the @xmath110 channel remains open but the transmission coefficient diminishes .",
    "the computation of @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) show results like the one drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , where all of the open channels @xmath97 at a given @xmath6 are included .",
    "@xmath7 is 39.89 mev , and @xmath43 t. the distance between the two peaks , 0.6 mev , is approximately twice the excitation energy to the first excited state of @xmath53 electrons in the dot .",
    "below , we will focus only on the first peak .",
    "the first two ( ground and first excited ) @xmath105 states contribute to this peak . both are above resonance .",
    "the second and higher excited states are below resonance .",
    "their contribution to @xmath51 is very little .",
    "thus , there are not channels at maximum resonance , and the value of @xmath51 at the peak is lower than the maximum @xmath117 for the @xmath110 channel . with a small decrease of @xmath7 , @xmath51 reaches the value @xmath118 , meaning that there is one channel at maximum resonance . notice that the distance between the first and second excited @xmath105 states is only 0.12 mev .",
    "it means that only levels which are very close in energy may be simultaneously resonant .",
    "the width of the one - channel peak , @xmath119 mev , may serve as an estimation of the resonance interval .",
    "the sensitivity of the first peak maximum with the number of levels in the resonance interval may be used for an experimental estimation of the density of levels at low excitation energies .",
    "we prove this statement in fig .",
    "the number of levels in an energy interval @xmath120 mev below the excitation energy @xmath49 is drawn along with the estimate ( points ) obtained from the conductance in the following way .",
    "we follow the first peak maximum for different @xmath7 .",
    "its position , i. e. the value of @xmath6 , is identified with the excitation energy @xmath49 , and from the height , @xmath121 , we obtain the number of levels in the resonance interval as      where @xmath123 is the value of @xmath51 when the first excited state @xmath124 is at maximum resonance .",
    "the idea behind eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is that the product in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) may be approximated as @xmath125 .",
    "we compare in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) the estimation coming from eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) with the exact level distribution obtained before .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "abrupt variations of the density of levels are nicely reproduced as well as the smooth behaviour obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "this agreement proves the factibility of measuring the low - energy density of levels in few - electron quantum dots by means of a precise measurement of the conductance .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have computed the density of spin - polarized levels of 6- and 7-electron quantum dots at low excitation energies and strong magnetic fields .",
    "the density is well parametrized by a constant temperature approximation .",
    "the temperature parameter , @xmath36 , shows a weak dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "we computed also the dot conductance ( transmission coefficient ) for vertical tunneling , and showed that the conductance at the upper edge of the coulomb blockade diamond is directly related to the density of levels . in this way",
    ", a procedure is suggested for the experimental determination of the low - lying density of states from a precise measurement of the conductance .",
    "altough calculations were carried out under the simplifying assumptions of zero temperature and strong magnetic fields , extensions to zero or weak fields and finite temperatures are also possible .",
