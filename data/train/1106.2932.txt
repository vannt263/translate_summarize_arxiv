    "in this paper we study the set @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an integer and @xmath5 denotes the fractional part .",
    "this set is related to badly approximable numbers in diophantine approximation , and has been studied by nilsson @xcite , who studied the hausdorff dimension of the set as a map of @xmath1 , and in more generality by urbanski @xcite who considered the orbit of an expanding map on the circle .",
    "as nilsson did we will consider @xmath6 as a subshift of finite type which enables us to see it as a problem in dynamical systems .",
    "when studied as a subshift of finite type we can find the dimension of @xmath6 using the spectral radius of the corresponding transition matrix , and this motivates the theorem of this paper which characterizes the characteristic polynomial of this matrix .",
    "the author would like to thank his phd supervisor simon kristensen and he would also like to than johan nilsson for reading and commenting on an early version of this paper .",
    "we begin with a definition of part and residue which comes from elementary integer division with residue .",

    "the matrix we will consider in this paper is defined as follows .    for @xmath16",
    "we define a 0 - 1 matrix @xmath17 of size @xmath18 by @xmath19 we let @xmath20 with @xmath21 be the @xmath22 matrix made from picking only the rows and columns from @xmath17 corresponding to the elements in @xmath23 and for @xmath24 we let @xmath25 be the @xmath26 matrix where we have removed the first @xmath27 rows and columns from @xmath17 .",
    "we will often omit the dependency on @xmath28 when it is not confusing . considering @xmath29 and @xmath30 in base @xmath0",
    "we see that @xmath31 if and only if the first @xmath32 digits of @xmath33 are equal to the last @xmath32 digits of @xmath34 .",
    "so when @xmath35 we see that the base @xmath36 expansions of the numbers in @xmath6 can be seen as a subshift of finite type with transition matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the metric of the subshift and the unit interval are equivalent so the dimensional properties are the same . in particular , finding the hausdorff dimension of @xmath6 now boils down to finding the spectral radius @xmath38 , since @xmath39 for a proof of the first equality see @xcite .",

    "this can also be expressed by saying that @xmath351 behaves somewhat like @xmath352 , which is true in the starting point of the intervals where @xmath330 is constant , so we get the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath354 be given . then if we let @xmath356 we have @xmath357 now @xmath358 and likewise for @xmath350 since both functions are decreasing .",
    "due to the result we got earlier on constant intervals we have @xmath359 so recalling the definition of @xmath29 we have @xmath360 and since @xmath361 as @xmath2 , both the lower and upper bound converges to @xmath75 .",

    "<S> in this paper we consider the times-@xmath0 map on the unit interval as a subshift of finite type by identifying each number with its base @xmath0 expansion , and we study certain non - dense orbits of this system where no element of the orbit is smaller than some fixed parameter @xmath1 .    the hausdorff dimension of these orbits can be calculated using the spectral radius of the transition matrix of the corresponding subshift , and using simple methods based on euclidean division in the integers , we completely characterize the characteristic polynomials of these matrices as well as give the value of the spectral radius for certain values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known through work of urbanski and nilsson that the hausdorff dimension of the orbits mentioned above as a map of @xmath1 is continuous and constant almost everywhere , and as a new result we give some asymptotic results on how this map behaves as @xmath2 . </S>"
