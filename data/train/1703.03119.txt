    "magnetic fields are important for star formation , propagation of cosmic rays , transport of heat etc .",
    "the observational study of magnetic fields , however , is limited by the ability of the available techniques to trace magnetic fields . for instance , in spite of the both progress of observational techniques and instrumentation for measuring emission ( see @xcite ) and absorption polarization @xcite and the recent progress in understanding grain alignment ( see for recent reviews ) the reliable high resolution tracing of magnetic fields is not readily available and requires a lot of resources ( e.g. planck example ) .",
    "in this situation is is very much advantageous to have alternative and synergetic ways of probing magnetic fields .",
    "astrophysical magnetic fields are turbulent and observations testify that turbulence is really ubiquitous in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "magnetic field makes turbulence anisotropic with turbulent eddies elongated along magnetic field ( see @xcite , for a review ) . as a result ,",
    "observed velocity correlations are expected to be elongated along magnetic field and this property was demonstrated with synthetic observations ( @xcite , henceforth el05 ) .",
    "later the study of anisotropies was performed using the principal component analysis ( pca ) and applied to observations @xcite .",
    "there is another way to employ properties of mhd turbulence in order to study magnetic fields .",
    "the aforementioned turbulent eddies aligned with magnetic field entail that the velocity gradients should have larger value when calculated perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this property of magnetic turbulence was employed by @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth gl16 ) who proposed tracing magnetic fields using velocity centroids gradients ( vcgs ) .",
    "the technique was elaborated by @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth yl17 ) and the new way of magnetic field tracing was successfully compared with observations of planck polarization .",
    "these papers introduced a new way of magnetic field studies with spectroscopic data .",
    "velocity centroids present one way of representing velocities .",
    "however , centroids have the contribution not only of velocity , but also of density ( see el05 ) and the density fluctuations are not as good aligned with magnetic field as velocity ( see @xcite ) . at the same time , the analytical study in @xcite revealed that channels maps are sensitive only to velocity fluctuations if the corresponding turbulent density fluctuations are dominated by large scale contributions .",
    "this motivates our present study to explore the ability of velocity channel gradients ( vchgs ) of magnetic field tracing .    in what follows",

    "mhd turbulence theory is the an old subject that has been boosted recently by the ability of performing high resolution 3d numerical simulations . before that there was no way of testing theoretical constructions and many competing theories describing mhd turbulence could co - exist .",
    "for instance , the original studies of alfvenic turbulence by @xcite and @xcite were based a hypothetical model of isotropic mhd turbulence .",
    "some of the later studies ( see @xcite ) pointed out to the anisotropic nature of the mhd cascade .",
    "however , the modern theory of mhd turbulence originates from the prophetic work by @xcite , henceforth gs95 ) .",
    "given originally rather lukewarm acceptance by the mhd turbulence pandits , this theory nevertheless was supported by further theoretical and numerical studies ( @xcite , henceforth lv99 , @xcite , see @xcite for a a review ) that extended the theory and provided its rigorous testing .",
    "our present study is based on the modern understanding of the mhd turbulence cascade and the statistical properties of turbulence confirmed numerically .",
    "the original gs95 theory is the incompressible mhd theory , i.e. the theory of alfvenic turbulence and the turbulence of pseudo - alfven waves .",
    "the latter represent fundamental slow waves in the incompressible limit .",
    "the third fundamental component of mhd perturbations , namely fast waves , do not exist in the incompressible limit where the sound velocity is infinitely high .",
    "the incompressible mhd turbulence was successfully tested in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies of the applicability of gs95 ideas and its generalizations for the compressible case ( see @xcite ) were first performed in @xcite .",
    "they testified that the gs95 incompressible scaling is applicable to the alfven and slow modes , while revealed that fast modes provide isotropic spectrum .",
    "in fact , these studies revealed that the fundamental modes can be considered separately , as for non - relativistic mhd turbulence the coupling between different types of fundamental modes is a subdominant effect therefore , in what follows we can consider three distinct cascades , namely , the cascade of alfven , slow and fast modes .",
    "numerical simulations show that the alfven and slow modes are dominant component of the cascade and those correspond to anisotropic perturbations aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "this provides the theoretical justification for relating gradients and magnetic fields in the observational studies .    in the subalfvenic regime ,",
    "i.e. for the injection velocity @xmath0 being less than the alfven velocity @xmath1 , the alfven modes initially evolve by increasing the perpendicular wavenumber while keeping the parallel wavenumber stays the same ( see lv99 , @xcite ) .",
    "the increase of the perpendicular wave number makes the the alfvenic wavevectors more and more perpendicular to magnetic field .",
    "therefore the gradients of magnetic field and velocity get aligned perpendicular to the magnetic - field direction .",
    "the increase of perpendicular wavenumbers while the parallel wavenumber stays the same , increases the energy cascading .",
    "when the fraction of cascaded energy becomes @xmath2 the gs95 cascade takes over .",
    "this happens at the scale @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the turbulence injection scale and @xmath5 is the alfven mach number ( see lv99 , @xcite ) . in the gs95 cascade",
    "both parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers of alfvenic perturbations increase . to quantify",
    "this one should adopt the system of reference aligned with the local magnetic field . in this system of reference",
    "the so - called critical balance condition should be satisfied , which states that the time of the interaction of the oppositely moving wavepackets / eddies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the parallel to magnetic field scale of the wavepacket / eddy is equal to the perpendicular shearing time of the wavepacket / eddy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the perpendicular scale of the wavepacket / eddy and @xmath10 is the turbulent velocity associated with this scale .",
    "this is how the cascade proceeds in the strong regime with the wavepackets getting more and more elongated according to ( lv99 ) : @xmath11 which testifies that for @xmath12 much smaller than the injection scale @xmath4 the perturbations are strongly elongated and aligned with the local magnetic field .",
    "therefore the gradients of the velocities are expected to be aligned with the _ local _ magnetic field and by measuring them one can trace the local variations of the magnetic field within a turbulent volume .    within the gs95 picture and its generalization to the compressible media",
    "( gs95 , @xcite ) the slow modes are slaved by alfven modes . indeed ,",
    "alfven modes shear and cascade slow mode perturbations , which is the process that is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "thus , in agreement with numerical studies , the the anisotropic scaling given by eq .",
    "( [ lpar ] ) is valid the slow mode eddies . as a result",
    "both the gradients of alfven modes and of slow modes are expected to be perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field .",
    "this is the key idea behind tracing magnetic - field directions with velocity gradients .",
    "while velocity gradients are directly not available from astrophysical observations of diffuse media , other measures can be constructed using observational data .",
    "velocity channel maps can be constructed using spectroscopic observations of doppler shifted lines .",
    "the statistics of these maps has been described in @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth lp00 ) for the optically thin data and in @xcite for the observations in the presence of absorption . in what follows we concentrate on the optically thin case and only mention some the possible effects of optically thick data.we note that when we discuss thin and thick slices of data , we mean not the effects of absorption but the thickness of channel maps .",
    "the minimal thickness of the latter is determined by the spectral resolution @xmath13 of the instrument , but it can be increased by integrating the spectroscopic data over larger @xmath13 .    an important prediction in lp00 is that velocity caustics create fluctuations of intensity of the channel maps and the relative importance of the velocity and density fluctuations changes with the thickness of the channel maps .",
    "in particular , lp00 identified a regime of `` thin velocity slices '' and found that in this regime the intensity fluctuations in the slice are dominated by the velocity fluctuations provided that the density fluctuations have the 3d spectrum that is steep , i.e. most of the fluctuating energy is concentrated at the large scales .",
    "the aforementioned statement about the steep density spectrum can be expressed in terms of the 3d power spectrum @xmath14 . in terms of this spectrum",
    "the kolmogorov cascade corresponds to @xmath15 and it is steep .",
    "the borderline spectrum is @xmath16 , with turbulence having spectrum @xmath17 , @xmath18 containing more energy at the small scale and therefore being shallow . for subsonic flows",
    "the density spectra in mhd turbulence are steep ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus for such flows the intensity fluctuations in thin velocity slices of position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data are influenced only by the turbulent velocity statistics .",
    "naturally , the thermal broadening interferes with the minimal slice of the ppv for which fluctuations can be studied .",
    "this means that for studying thin slices of subsonic flows one should use heavier species that those of the main hydrogen astrophysical flow .",
    "the heavier species which are referred usually in the interstellar literature as `` metals '' can be used .",
    "if the density spectrum is shallow , i.e. @xmath18 , the contribution of density and velocities to the statistics of intensity fluctuations of the velocity slices was evaluated in lp00 . for thin slices ,",
    "both velocity and density are important , while the contribution of velocity decreases as the slice thickness increases .",
    "when the integration is performed over the entire line , only density fluctuations determine the fluctuations of the resulting intensity distribution .",
    "the anisotropy of mhd turbulence results in the anisotropy of the intensity distribution within the ppv slices .",
    "this was first demonstrated with the observational data in @xcite where a new technique of studying magnetic field direction was suggested . later a systematic numerical study of the change of the anisotropy of intensity fluctuations in ppv slices was performed in @xcite .",
    "an analytical study of the effect of the alfven , slow and fast modes on the anisotropy of intensity fluctuations in the ppv slices was performed in @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth klp16 ) .",
    "this study opens an avenue for separating the contributions of the different modes using the anisotropies of the measured correlation functions of the slice intensities .    in view of the above ,",
    "it is important to perform the study of the gradients of intensities within ppv slices . in terms of the separating the compressible and incompressible components in klp16 ,",
    "such a study provides an additional test that the anisotropies are actually caused by turbulence . by varying the thickness of the slice one can study the variation of gradients as the relative contribution of density and velocity changes",
    "this may be important as the density and velocity , in general , have different statistics and the fluctuations of these fields are aligned with magnetic field to a different degree .",
    "for instance , the strongly supersonic flows demonstrate isotropic spectra of density . in addition",
    ", for studies of galactic flows the regular shear opens a way to study different turbulent regions separately and therefore different channel maps can be associated with different locations within the galactic volume .    in what follows the advancements of the understanding of the theory of ppv anisotropies in klp16",
    "guide us in studying gradients in the ppv velocity slices .",
    "note that the criterion for the velocity slice of being thin or thick as it given in lp00 is as follows : the velocity slice is thin if the square root of turbulent velocity dispersion on the scales that the slice is being studied @xmath19 is _ greater _ than the thickness of the slice @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the separation of the correlating points over plane of the sky , i.e. the pp separation . in the following , we would characterize the channel thickness by whether the ratio @xmath22 passes through unity .",
    "the numerical data was obtained by numerical simulations using a single fluid , operator - split , staggered grid mhd eulerian code zeus - mp/3d @xcite to set up a three - dimensional , uniform , isothermal turbulent medium .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to emulate a part of interstellar cloud .",
    "solenoidal turbulence injection was employed .",
    "our simulations consists of various alfvenic mach number @xmath5 and sonic mach number @xmath23 , where @xmath0 is the injection velocity , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the alfven and sonic velocities respectively , which they are listed in[tab : simulationparameters ] .",
    "the domain @xmath26 corresponds to the simulations of plasmas with magnetic pressure larger than the thermal pressure , i.e. plasmas with low @xmath27 , while the domain @xmath28 corresponds to the pressure dominated plasmas with @xmath29 .    to investigate the detail structure of gradients from different @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we employ the wave mode decomposition method in @xcite to extract alfven , slow and fast modes from velocity data .",
    "the corresponding equations determining the basis for the decomposition into modes are :    [ eq : fsa - decompositions ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we would only use the los component of the decomposed velocities for velocity channels calculations.that is to say , the three velocity modes can then be acquired by @xmath36(\\hat{\\zeta}_{f , s , a } \\cdot \\hat{\\zeta}_{los})\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the fourier transform operator .",

    "notice that the velocity field have not been decomposed by the cl03 method yet.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.0% ]    the fact that the vchgs for thin maps are strongly influenced by the velocity field shows the promise of the approach for tracing magnetic fields using thin channel maps .",
    "below we consider the gradients arising from alfven , slow and fast modes separately .",
    "the theoretical considerations giving the guidance for this study are provided in klp16 , where the anisotropies of the correlation of the intensities arising from velocities were studied .",
    "the dynamics of alfvenic modes in the strong mhd turbulence are very different from the dynamics of freely propagating alfven waves .",
    "the modes cascade on the scale of the order of one period and the wavevector of the alfvenic perturbations in strong turbulence is nearly perpendicular to the local direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the anisotropy of the intensity correlation of the iso - contours of correlation is elongated _ parallel _ to magnetic field .",
    "the latter is essential for tracing of magnetic fields , as the gradients that these modes are inducing are also perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field , which is employed in gl16 , yl17 and consequent studies from them .    for alfven modes",
    "the theoretical expectation is very natural : the anisotropy of the intensity correlations in a thin slice increases with the decrease of the alfven mach number , i.e. the smaller the velocity perturbations , the more anisotropic is the velocity distribution .",

    "their respective gradients ( red for vchgs , green for igs ) are overplotted by projected magnetic field ( blue).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.0% ]         as we increase the thickness of channel maps , the @xmath44 of alfven modes is decreasing , which is shown in the blue curves in [ fig : alf-3 ] .",
    "at the same time the contrast of the gradients given by @xmath45 is decreasing . due to this decrease",
    "the role of velocity fluctuations in the channel map fluctuations is decreasing and the thick channels get dominated by density effects .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : alf-4 ] . a more detailed discussion on the contribution of density effect will be in  5 .",
    "one should remember , however , that whether the channels are thin or thick depends on the size of the eddies that are being studied ( lp00 ) .",
    "therefore , if we calculate the gradients for the large blocks , we are sampling large eddies and for such large eddies the slices can be still thin .",
    "variation of @xmath46 with respect to channel map thickness.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      slow waves present perturbations of magnetic field and density that propagate along magnetic field lines . in the limit of incompressible media , slow waves are pure magnetic compressions that propagate along magnetic field lines .",
    "formally the incompressible case corresponds to @xmath47 and in this limit the slow modes are frequently called preudo - alfven modes . for @xmath48 the slow waves are density perturbations propagating along magnetic field lines .    in the presence of alfvenic turbulence , slow modes do not evolve on their own , but are sheared by alfven modes . as a result , the features of alfvenic turbulence , e.g. spectrum and anisotropies , are imprinted on the slow modes ( see gs95 , @xcite ) .",
    "that also means the perpendicular velocity gradients in alfven modes will also be inherited by slow modes .",
    "figure [ fig : slow-1 ] illustrates the channel maps for a thin slice for the case of low @xmath38 ( left panel ) and high @xmath38 ( right panel ) .",
    "it is obvious that low @xmath38 vchgs performs better , which is also shown in figure [ fig : alf-3 ] .",

    "channel maps from high @xmath38 systems are not as highly structured as the maps with low @xmath38    as @xmath49 and @xmath50 are complementary measures of the physical conditions in mhd turbulence , we can study the change of @xmath38 by varying @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : slow-2 ] shows the change of the @xmath44 of the vchgs in the thin channels induced by slow modes for different @xmath38 by changing @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , while according to klp16 the anisotropies of correlation functions of the intensities in thin slice for slow modes are different for the case of low-@xmath38 and high-@xmath38 plasmas , the properties of turbulence are also changing with @xmath30 .",

    "moreover , the change of @xmath44 from slow modes due to a change of channel width is much more significant than that of alfven modes . while these modes are not direct observables , as both modes contributes to velocity gradient alignments .",
    "the result of figure [ fig : alf-3 ] suggests velocity centroid maps without proper selection of channel widths may only have fair performance due to pollution of @xmath44 from slow modes .",
    "this in turn suggesting a reduction of channel widths can enhance the performance on tracing magnetic fields using the gradient technique .",
    "similar to the properties of the slow modes , the properties of fast modes are different in low and high @xmath38 plasmas . for high @xmath38 plasmas",
    "the fast wave are similar to sound waves that propagate with sound speed irrespectively of the magnetic field direction .",

    "the low @xmath38 map carries more structures than that of high @xmath38 map , but they are obviously carrying different anisotropy direction when examining the contours in the maps . in the language of fast mode gradients ,",
    "the maximal gradient is _ parallel _ to local magnetic field direction .",
    "figure [ fig : fast-2 ] illustrates the @xmath44 of fast modes vchgs which the gradient vectors are not rotated .",
    "in contrast to the decreasing @xmath44 for rotated alfven and slow mode vchgs , the @xmath44 of unrotated fast mode vchgs increases significantly when the channel width passes through unity for both low and high @xmath38 case .",
    "this suggests a decrease of channel width can suppress the contribution of fast modes in velocity gradient calculations .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that fast modes are subdominant at least for the cases of incompressible driving of turbulence .",
    "our study indicates that in terms of vchgs one can expect a further suppression of the fast mode contribution in thin channels .",
    "this important as the directions of gradients induced by fast modes are orthogonal to those by fast and slow modes and , therefore , potentially their interference could make magnetic field tracing less reliable . at the same time , this peculiar properties of gradients arising from fast modes can be used to separate their contribution . note , that fast modes are identified in @xcite as the dominant source of cosmic ray scattering within galactic environments .",
    "to study the relative importance of density and velocity fluctuations , we create synthetic maps by transposing the velocity data cube on the plane - of - sky plane , if the original velocity cube is @xmath52 , and the line - of - sight along the x - direction , then the transposed cube is @xmath53 .",
    "computationally , we would calculate the correlation function anisotropy of a quantity called _ transposed centroid _",
    "@xmath54 : @xmath55    the reason behind this is that both densities and velocities are anisotropic and trace the local magnetic field direction .",
    "after the transpose procedure , the velocity anisotropies are orthogonal to that from density data and the relative influence of the two contributions to the centroid anisotropy can be evaluated .",
    "when examining the anisotropy using the correlation function @xmath56 in the transposed centroid map , the ratio between the axis perpendicular ( the elongation direction of @xmath54 ) to magnetic field direction over that of parallel one ( the elongation direction of @xmath57 ) will reflect the relative importance of velocity to density fluctuations .",
    "a scatter plot showing the change of axis ratio relative to velocity slice thickness.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figure [ fig : fluc-1 ] shows the decreasing trend of the aforementioned axis ratio as velocity slice thickness increases .",
    "it is evident that even though density information can contaminate the contribution of alignment to magnetic field from velocity information , the overall anisotropy comes from the velocity centroid , which essentially a weighted product of density and velocity data , is still carrying the anisotropic nature along local magnetic field directions .",
    "nevertheless , using a thin slice can reduce the contribution from density data , which in turn provide a more reliable detection of local magnetic field .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the anisotropies in channel maps can trace magnetic fields . while these anisotropies can be very informative in terms of determining the relative contribution of compressible versus incompressible modes ( see kandel et al .",
    "2016 , 2017 ) , the tracing of the detailed magnetic field structure is problematic with them .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cfa-1 ] we show the vchgs alignment measure @xmath44 versus the alignment measure of the directions of the maximal anisotropy ( elongation ) of the correlation functions of the channel map intensities .",
    "we clearly see that the channel map intensities are not good for detailed magnetic field tracing , which is consistent to our previous studies on the comparisons of alignments from correlation function anisotropies and different types of gradients ( see yl17 , @xcite , yl17b ) .     a comparison of @xmath44 on a thin channel map when applying the gradient technique and correlation function anisotropy techniques to alfven mode vchgs .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the reason of this is easy to understand .",
    "the velocity gradients correspond to the angular velocities of turbulent eddies .",
    "these individual eddies are aligned with the local magnetic field . on the contrary ,",
    "the correlation functions are the measures that are well defined only after the ensemble averaging .",
    "thus the averaging over small patches does not produce good statistics necessary for the correlation functions to be well defined .",
    "our study above suggests that the decrease of channel width improves the alignment the gradient and magnetic field alignment .",
    "however , it is important to understand whether one can use only a part of the spectral line for the analysis . given the channel map data one can form _ reduced centroids _ that contain only part of the line : @xmath58 where the index @xmath59 determines the order of the centroid .",
    "increasing @xmath59 may enhance the effects of velocity , but it also can increase the noise .",
    "these measures are useful both in the case of studying gradients from extended galactic disk data and also for the data from the wings of the absorption lines .    with the dispersion of velocities",
    "@xmath60 from equation [ criterion ] and the average width of all the doppler shifted lines @xmath61 , we can classify the line into three regions , namely the central part , the middle part and the wing .",
    "we would like to illustrate the alignment of gradients for the reduced centroid from each of these three portion of the lines using the alfven mode .",
    "figure [ fig : rc-1 ] illustrates the @xmath62 reduced centroid from a selected alfven mode velocity data cube .",
    "the central portion is very much the same as the thin slice result , giving an excellent alignment in respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the middle portion of the reduced centroid also shows a fair alignment , but the number of data points gets limited due to the limitations of the numerical resolution and the shot noise increase . nevertheless , the gradient map after sub - block average still provides a nice fit to magnetic field direction .",
    "the wing portion for this illustration is very much limited by the discrete data : it does not contain enough data points even for showing the distribution of centroids .",
    "in fact , in mhd turbulence we expect that the overall profile to be determined by the largest eddies that produce most of the dispersion .",
    "the gradients are not expected to depend on this .",
    "therefore all three parts of the line should be influenced by the small scale eddies that are aligned in respect to the magnetic fields local to them . by looking at the contour structure of the three maps ,",
    "we actually see the correspondence of the elongation to magnetic field directions obtained with different parts of the line .",
    "for observations of galactic hi the use of different portions of the line is not any more just a test of our theoretical concepts . due to the galactic rotation ,",
    "different parts of the galactic hi have different velocities in respect to the observer .",
    "therefore one can trace the variations of magnetic field using the reduced centroids . to demonstrate the effect we use the galfa data and compare our results with the averaged along the line of sight magnetic field directions as they are traced by planck polarization . unlike the study with full centroids in yl17",
    "now we do not expect good tracing if the perpendicular direction of magnetic field is changing along the line of sight .",
    "following the same procedure as in yl17 and selecting the same region with the same resolution , we calculate the reduced centroid by varying velocity thickness @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : obs-1 ] shows the resulting map from the central , middle and wing parts of the line that are obtained using the reduced centroids .",
    "we see notable variations of the alignment which may be indicative of the magnetic field direction variation along the line of sight",
    ". this conclusion can be tested by using starlight polarization from the stars with known distances .",
    "turbulence can be studied using both velocity centroids and channel maps ( see in terms of the properties of correlation functions both techniques have full analytical treatment based on the statistics of the ppv developed in lp00 and @xcite .",
    "the anisotropies of the statistics of the channel maps is described in klp17 and of the velocity centroids in @xcite .",
    "the two techniques have proven to be complementary .",
    "for instance , studies of supersonic turbulence spectra is heavily distorted for velocity centroids @xcite . at the same time , supersonic turbulence is the natural domain for velocity channel analysis ( vca ) suggested in lp00 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in view of",
    "that we feel it is advantageous to use gradients for both velocity centroids and channel maps .",
    "the most interesting case for the gradient technique that we explore is the case of gradients in thin channel maps . in this regime",
    "the gradients of channel map intensities are affected mostly by velocity fluctuations , the latter tracing magnetic field better than densities . on the contrary , the gradients in the velocity channels in the limiting case when the velocity channels are wide to encompass the entire line correspond the intensity gradients .",
    "the latter case was studied in @xcite .",
    "the statistics of channel of intermediate thickness reflects both density and velocity statistics",
    ".    for the studies of magnetic fields in the disk of the galaxy gradients within channel maps allow to investigate the line of sight distribution of magnetic fields using the galactic rotation curve . however , the interpretation of the results for the diffuse distribution should include the dispersion induced by turbulence .",
    "it is not possible to increase the 3d spacial resolution of the magnetic field directions by going to the thin velocity channels .",
    "the change of the channel thickness , nevertheless , changes the relative contributions of the velocity and density fluctuations into the channel map .    in terms of resolving the spacial structure of magnetic field , for the atomic hydrogen studies the spatial resolution depends both on the direction of study , the velocity range as well as on the turbulent velocity dispersion .",
    "the latter provides the grid size @xmath63 that should be multiplied to the visual shear along the line of sight @xmath64 in the direction of the observations .",
    "individual clouds with high density contrast can be studied separately .",
    "this can be relevant to e.g. co@xmath65 .",
    "if we imagine a situation that direction of magnetic field is changing along the line of sight the techniques that are discussed here can provide a coarse graded picture of the changes of the magnetic field direction perpendicular to the line of sight . in this way we can distinguish the variations of regular magnetic field over the cells that are larger than @xmath66 . choosing velocity slice thickness much less than @xmath0 we are not getting higher spacial resolutions , but changing the relative contributions of the velocity and density fluctuations in the channels . if we choose the velocity slice thickness of the order of the turbulent velocity dispersion it produces a rough structure of the column densities over the size of the large scale eddies .",
    "therefore the corresponding channel map gradients can be associated with the igs that trace magnetic field with the limitations relevant to the ig tracing .",
    "in the situation when the effects of velocities should be stressed , the reduced centroids can also be used .",
    "in fact , or the hi line broadened through galactic rotation if the averaging over the entire turbulent velocity dispersion and taking gradients brings us back to the well known igs , the calculation of the reduced centroids over the velocity dispersion provides the vcg measure .",
    "in the paper above we have shown that the gradients calculated within velocity channel maps , i.e. vchgs , can trace magnetic field in diffuse media .",
    "these measures are complementary to the velocity centroids gradients , i.e. vcgs .",
    "our decomposition of the turbulent velocities into alfven , slow and fast modes shows that these modes provide different signatures in terms of the vchgs . in particular ,    1 .",
    "we tested that the alignments of alfven and slow modes increases as the slice gets thinner .",
    "we showed that fast modes , whose gradients are parallel to magnetic field , can be suppressed by using thin slices .",
    "we showed that density contributions can be suppressed also by using thin slices .",
    "we constructed observable measures termed `` reduced centroids '' and explored their ability to trace magnetic fields .",
