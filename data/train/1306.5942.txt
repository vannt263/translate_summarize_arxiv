    "in this paper we consider the helmholtz equation with robin boundary condition which is the first order approximation of the radiation condition .",
    "the equation is written in a mixed form as follows : find @xmath0 such that @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is a polygonal or polyhedral domain , @xmath4 is known as the wave number , @xmath5 denotes the imaginary unit , and @xmath6 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath7 .",
    "helmholtz equation finds applications in many important fields , e.g. , in acoustics , seismic inversion and electromagnetic , but how to solve the helmholtz equation efficiently is still of great challenge .",
    "the strong indefiniteness has prevented the standard multigrid methods from being directly applied to the discrete helmholtz equation . in @xcite ,",
    "elman , ernst and oleary modified the standard multigrid algorithm by adding gmres iterations as corrections on coarse grids and using it as an outer iteration .",
    "but in order to obtain a satisfactory convergence behavior , a relatively large number of gmres smoothing should be performed on coarse grids which leads to relatively large memory requirement , so the optimality of the multigrid algorithm can not be guaranteed . in @xcite , the authors utilized the continuous interior penalty finite element methods @xcite to construct the stable coarse grid correction problems , which reduces the steps of gmres smoothing on coarse grids .",
    "based on the fact that the error components which can not be reduced by the standard multigrid can be factorized by representing it as the product of a certain high - frequency fourier component and a ray function , brandt and livshits introduced so - called wave - ray multigrid methods in @xcite .",
    "although this method exhibits high convergence rate with increasing wave number , it does not easily generalize to unstructured grids and complicated helmholtz problems .",
    "besides , shifted laplacian preconditioners @xcite and sweeping preconditioners @xcite based on an approximate @xmath8 factorization were introduced to solve the helmholtz equation with high wave number . a survey of the development of fast iterative solvers can be found in @xcite .",
    "hybridizable discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) method has two main advantages in the discretization of helmholtz equation .",
    "first , it is a stable method , which means that the discrete system is always well - posed without any mesh constraint .",
    "rigorous convergence analysis of the hdg method for helmholtz equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "second , comparing to standard discontinuous galerkin method , hdg method results in significantly reducing the degrees of freedom , especially when the polynomial degree @xmath9 is large .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no efficient iterative method or preconditioner for hdg discretization system for the hemholtz equation in the literature has been proposed .",
    "the hybridized system is a linear equation for lagrange multipliers which is obtained by eliminating the flux as well as the primal variable . for the second - order elliptic problems ,",
    "a schwarz preconditioner for the algebraic system was presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the application of a variable v - cycle multigrid algorithm for the hybridized mixed method for second - order elliptic boundary value problems . in their multigrid algorithm , both smoothing and correction on coarse grids are based on standard piecewise linear continuous finite element discretization system .",
    "the convergence of the multigrid algorithm is dependent on an assumption that the number of smoothings increases in a specific way ( see theorem 3.1 in @xcite for details ) .",
    "the critical ingredient in the algorithm is how to choose a suitable intergrid transfer operator .",
    "numerical experiments in @xcite show that certain ` obvious ' transfer operators lead to slow convergence .",
    "the objective of this paper is to propose a robust multilevel method for the hdg method approximation of the helmholtz equation .",
    "the main ingredients in multilevel method are how to construct coarse grid correction problem and perform efficient smoothing .",
    "since strong indefiniteness arises for helmholtz equation with large wave number , standard jacobi or gauss - seidel smoothers become unstable on the coarse grids .",
    "motivated by the idea in @xcite , we use gmres smoothing for those coarse grids . unlike the smoothing strategy in @xcite ,",
    "the number of gmres smoothing steps in our algorithm is much smaller , even if one smoothing step may guarantee the convergence of our multilevel algorithm .",
    "moreover , both smoothing on fine and coarse grids in our multilevel method are based on hybridized system of lagrange multiplier on each level .",
    "_ local fourier analysis",
    "_ ( lfa ) has been introduced for multigrid analysis by achi brandt in 1977 ( cf .",
    "we mainly utilize the lfa to analyze smoothing properties of relaxations and convergence properties of two and three level methods in the one dimensional case .",
    "this may provide quantitative insights into the proposed multilevel method for helmholtz problem ( [ hs])-([he ] ) .",
    "a survey for lfa can be found in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we firstly review the formulation of hdg method for the helmholtz equation and present our multilevel algorithm .",
    "the stability estimate of the intergrid transfer operator will be carried out in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the lfa of the multilevel method in one dimensional case .",
