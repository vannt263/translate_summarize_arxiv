    "the emission - line spectrum of hii regions can be detected and analyzed even at very large distances .",
    "they are essential probes to measure distances of extragalactic objects , the intensity and properties of star formation processes and the chemical composition of the interstellar medium .",
    "in fact , hii regions provide most of our current knowledge about the chemical composition of the universe .",
    "the spectra of nebulae contain emission lines of several ionization species of chemical elements that are present in the ionized gas .",
    "the analysis of emission - lines permits to determine the abundance  the ratio of the number of atoms of a given element with respect to those of h  of important elements as he , c , n , o , cl , @xmath0-elements as ne , s and ar and iron - peak elements as fe and ni . in the next decade",
    ", the use of 30 - 50 m aperture telescopes will probably permit to derive abundances of some neutron - capture s - elements as se or kr in the brightest hii regions .    the o abundance determined from nebular",
    "spectra is the most widely used proxy of metallicity for galaxies at different redshifts . a proper determination of the physical conditions  electron temperature , @xmath1 , and density , @xmath2  is necessary for obtaining reliable and accurate metallicities .",
    "many of the emission lines in nebular spectra are excited by collisions with free electrons ",
    "the so - called collisionally excited lines ( cels )  and are forbidden by the selection rules .",
    "cels can be very bright due to the high electron temperatures and low densities of ionized nebulae .",
    "in addition , there are also bright recombination lines of hi ",
    "balmer series in the optical  and hei . in the last two decades",
    ", our group has developed a long - term research project devoted to measure very faint pure recombination lines ( rls ) of heavy - element ions in hii regions from high- and intermediate - resolution spectroscopical data .",
    "the optical - nir spectral range contains rls of oi , oii , cii and neii , which intensities are of the order of 0.0001 to 0.001 times that of h@xmath3 . due to their faintness",
    ", these lines can only be detected and measured in bright nebulae using large aperture telescopes .    for several decades",
    "it has turned out that abundances of heavy - element ions determined from the standard method based on the intensity ratios of collisionally excited lines ( cels ) are systematically lower than those derived from the faint rls emitted by the same ions .",
    "this fact , usually known as the _ abundance discrepancy _ ( ad ) problem is quantified by the abundance discrepancy factor ( hereafter adf ) , defined as the difference between the logarithmic abundances derived from rls and cels : @xmath4 in galactic and extragalactic hii regions , the adf of o@xmath5 ",
    "adf(o@xmath5 )  is between 0.10 and 0.35 dex ( e.g. garca - rojas & esteban 2007 ; lpez - snchez et al . 2007 ;",
    "esteban et al . 2009 , 2014 ; toribio san cipriano et al . 2016 , 2017 ) and can be even much larger in some planetary nebulae ( pne , see paper by garca - rojas in this proceedings ) .",
    "it is important to remark that other ions with optical rls : c@xmath5 , ne@xmath5 , and o@xmath6 give values of their adfs similar to those obtained for the adf(o@xmath5 ) for the same object ( garca - rojas & esteban 2007 ; toribio san cipriano et al .",
    "2017 ) , although the data for those ions are more limited and difficult to obtain ( see table  [ table ] ) .",

    "the origin of the ad is still unknown , but several hypotheses have been proposed . in this paper",
    "we will limit our discussion to the case of hii regions . for pne",
    "the situation is more complex because they can contain material with different physical conditions and composition ( see peimbert & peimbert 2006 ; garca - rojas , this proceedings ) .",
    "the first hypothesis for explaining the ad was formulated by torres - peimbert et  al .",
    "they propose that the ad is produced by spatial fluctuations of electron temperature , @xmath7 , in the ionized gas , in the form originally proposed by peimbert ( 1967 ) .",
    "however , these temperature variations can not be reproduced by chemically homogeneous photoionization models and different mechanisms have been invoked to explain their presence in ionized nebulae ( see esteban 2002 ; peimbert & peimbert 2006 ) . according to this scenario",
    ", rls should provide the true abundances because their emissivities are much less dependent on temperature that those of cels .",
    "in fact , in the typical range of @xmath1 of hii regions , the emissivities of the rls of heavy - element ions are almost identical to that of h@xmath3 and therefore abundances derived from rls are practically independent on @xmath1 .",
    "nicholls et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) have proposed that a @xmath8-distribution of electron energies  departure from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution  can be operating in nebulae and produce the ad , being also the determinations based on rls the most reliable ones .",
    "however , some recent works have seriously questioned this hypothesis ( e. g. zhang et  al .",
    "2016 ; ferland et  al .",
    "a third hypothesis was proposed by stasiska et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and is based on the existence of semi - ionized clumps embedded in the ambient gas of hii regions . these hypothetical clumps ",
    "unmixed supernova ejecta  would be strong rl emitters , denser , cooler and more metallic than the ambient nebular gas . assuming this scenario , abundances derived from rls and cels should be upper and lower limits , respectively , to the true ones , though those from cels should be more reliable .",
    "there is even a last scenario outlined by tsamis et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which involves the presence of high - density clumps but without abundance contrast between the components .    until now",
    ", the only work where the ad problem in a sample of hii regions has been discussed in length is that by garca - rojas & esteban ( 2007 ) .",
    "they found that the adf is fairly constant and of order 2 in a limited sample of galactic and extragalactic hii regions .",
    "in addition , they did not find correlations between the adf(o@xmath5 ) and the o / h , o@xmath5/h@xmath6 ratios , the ionization degree , @xmath1 , fwhm of several bright emission - lines , and the effective temperature of the main ionizing stars within the observational uncertainties . on the contrary",
    ", they found that adf seems to be slightly dependent on the excitation energy of the levels that produce the rls , a fact that is consistent with the predictions of the classical temperature fluctuations or @xmath8-distributions hypotheses .",
    "if cels and rls give different abundances , in which lines shall we trust ? there are some observational evidences that can give us clues about this important question . in figure  [ abund_orion_1 ]",
    "we represent the abundances of 4 representative elements  c , n , o , and ne  for which abundances have been derived from different kinds of lines in the orion nebula : cels in the ultraviolet ( uv , walter et  al .",
    "1992 ; tsamis et  al .",
    "2011 ) , optical ( esteban et  al . 2004 ) and far infrared ( fir , simpson et  al . 1986",
    "; rubin et  al .",
    "2011 ) , and optical rls ( esteban et  al .",
    "2004 ) . except in the case of c ",
    "for which there are two discrepant independent abundance determinations from uv cels  there is a tendency to increase the abundance when we move to the right in the diagrams , in the sense that the lines which intensity is less dependent on @xmath1 give higher abundances .",
    "this tendency agrees qualitatively with the predictions if the ad is produced by the temperature fluctuations or @xmath8-distribution hypotheses .        in figure  [ abund_orion_2 ]",
    "we compare the abundances of c , o and ne of the orion nebula  using uv or optical cels and rls  with those of other objects of the solar neighbourhood for which absolute abundances can be derived .",
    "we include the sun ( asplund et  al .",
    "2009 ; caffau et  al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) , young f&g stars ( sofia & meyer 2001 ) , and b - type stars ( nieva & simn - daz 2011 ) . the size of the bars is proportional to their uncertainty . for c / h we can see that the solar and stellar values are quite consistent with the values obtained for the orion nebula using rls , a similar trend is also found for o / h .",
    "however , we would expect some depletion into dust for both elements in the orion nebula , of the order of about 0.1 dex according to esteban et al .",
    "ne is a noble gas and no dust depletion is expected for this element and the results also indicate that the stellar and solar ne abundances are more consistent with the ne / h ratios determined from rls in the orion nebula .",
    "it is interesting to note that the accurate determination of ne / h obtained by rubin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) from fir cels observed with _",
    "spitzer _ is consistent with the rls values .",
    "this result is also consistent with the predictions of the temperature fluctuations or @xmath8-distribution hypotheses considering the low temperature dependence of the emissivity of fir cels . from the results presented in figures  [ abund_orion_1 ] and [ abund_orion_2 ]",
    ", one can conclude that nebular abundances determined from rls are more consistent with those of the sun and other stellar objects of the solar neighbourhood than those determined from cels .",
    "since 2002 , our group has measured cii and oii rls in several tens of extragalactic hii regions ( esteban et  al . 2002 , 2009 , 2014 ; lpez - snchez et al . 2007 ; toribio san cipriano 2016 , 2017 ) . in several of those papers",
    "we have compared our nebular abundances derived from cels and rls with those determined in early b - type stars located in their vicinity .",
    "the o abundance of early b - type stars  which is not expected to be affected by stellar evolution effects  should reflect the present - day chemical composition of the interstellar material in the regions where they are located . the results for extragalactic objects are not always consistent with the aforementioned ones discussed for the orion nebula .",

    "these authors found that the stellar o / h ratios are in better agreement with the nebular abundances calculated using rls in the case of m33 , while in the case of ngc 300 the agreement is better with cels .",

    ", their dispersion may be due to aperture effects because we tend to observe bright small areas in these objects and their adf could not be representative of the whole nebula . as it has been proven in several works ( e.g. mesa - delgado et  al .",

    "the low - metallicity objects correspond to more distant objects , their spectra are obtained from apertures that encompass a large fraction of the nebula and , therefore , their observed areas are more representative of the global emission .",

    "the trend of a decrease of adf with increasing of @xmath1([oiii ] ) in hii regions of near - solar metallicity and @xmath1([oiii ] ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 k was previously reported by rodrguez & manso sainz ( 2014 ) .",

    "we can see that the trends of the adf towards high metallicity and low @xmath1 are practically washed out .",
    "the interpretation of this behavior is not easy . in low - ionization nebulae with o@xmath5/o @xmath11 0.5 ,",
    "the o / h ratio is dominated by o@xmath6 , and therefore the physical conditions of the o@xmath5 zone  specially @xmath1  may be not representative of the whole hii region .",

    "another interesting aspect of figure  [ adf_mosaic ] is the large adf(o@xmath5 ) values reported in some giant hii regions belonging to star - forming dwarf galaxies ( pink down - facing triangles ) .",
    "esteban et al .",
    "( 2016 ) speculate that large adfs in hii regions might be produced by the presence of shocks due to large - scale interaction between the ionized gas and of stellar winds . a process that may dominate the kinematics of these complex and huge nebulae .",
    "this suggestion is based on the results obtained by mesa - delgado et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and esteban et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , who determined the adf(o@xmath5 ) in several galactic ring nebulae associated with evolved massive stars .",
