    "generally , such scale transformation changes the position of the surface .",
    "we will always choose the origin of coordinates as special point on the surfaces , such as apex of the cone , ensuring that the position does not change either .",
    "this point will also play an important role in the physical problem : in diffusion problem the particle will be released in the neighborhood of that point , while in the polymer problem one end of the polymer will be held in that vicinity .",
    "the absence of a geometric length scale leads to a rather interesting behavior of the solutions of the diffusion problem , as we explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] . in general ,",
    "the diffusion problem can be related to statistical mechanics of _ ideal polymers _ in which self - interactions can be neglected @xcite . in the case of sf surfaces the solutions of diffusion equations can be used to infer the prefactor in force - distance relation characterizing interactions between ideal polymers and the surfaces @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : polymer ] explains the relation between the diffusion and ideal polymer problems , as well as discusses some general features of polymers near surfaces . in this work",
    "we employ a simple numerical approach to the problem and demonstrate its usefulness to the quantitative solution of polymer - surface interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe our numerical approach , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we use such solutions to gain intuitive insights into the behavior of ideal polymers near repulsive surfaces that have no azimuthal symmetry .",
    "in its most elementary form the diffusion process is described by the probability density @xmath3 of finding a diffusing particle at a position @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , if at @xmath6 it was located at @xmath7 .",
    "such probability satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath8 which must be supplemented by the initial condition @xmath9 , as well as by the boundary conditions . in the presence of",
    "_ absorbing _ boundaries it is required that @xmath10 vanishes when @xmath4 is on the boundary .",
    "equation corresponds to diffuser in continuous space performing infinitesimal steps . for a random walker on a @xmath11-dimensional periodic ( e.g. , hypercubic ) lattice with lattice constant @xmath12 , with dimensionless time measuring the number of discrete steps , the laplacian in eq .",
    "is replaced by its discrete version , while the time derivative of @xmath10 becomes a difference in probabilities at ( dimensionless ) times @xmath13 and @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the diffusion constant becomes @xmath14 .",
    "( the theory presented here is valid at arbitrary @xmath11 , but the numerical examples will focus on simulations performed on a three - dimensional cubic lattice . ) in the presence of absorbing boundaries , the survival probability @xmath15 of a particle that at time @xmath6 was at point @xmath7 decays with time .",
    "the function @xmath16 also satisfies @xcite diffusion eq .   with spatial derivatives taken with respect to variable @xmath7 , but its initial condition is @xmath17 inside the permitted volume while vanishing ( at any @xmath5 ) on the absorbing boundary .    the trace of a particle diffusing on a lattice for time @xmath18 can be viewed as a configuration of an ideal polymeric chain with @xmath19 monomers @xcite . in the absence of confining surfaces",
    "the number of different configurations starting at a specific lattice site @xmath7 is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the coordination number of a lattice .",
    "if _ repulsive _ boundaries are present , the configurations that cross the boundary must be excluded .",

    "finite _ space surrounded by absorbing surfaces can be presented in the form @xcite @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the equation @xmath26 , while the prefactors @xmath27 depend on the initial position @xmath7 of the particle .",

    "we note that eqs .   and , as well as the equations that will be derived from them in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , are valid for any sf surfaces and do not require additional symmetries , such as azimuthal symmetry .",
    "many properties of polymers in free space @xcite and near limiting surfaces @xcite can be deduced from the theory of critical phenomena . in particular ,",
    "some behaviors are characterized by critical exponents , that are independent of microscopic details of the hamiltonian .",
    "such universality enables usage of simplified models , such as rws on lattices representing ideal polymers , or self - avoiding walks ( saws ) representing polymers in good solvent @xcite . on a regular lattice ,",
    "the number of conformations of a polymer in free space is @xmath47 , where @xmath21 is the lattice coordination number in the case of a rw , and an effective coordination number in the case of saw .",
    "critical exponent @xmath48 is universal @xcite .",
    "this exponent is related by fisher s identity @xcite to correlation length exponent @xmath49 and the exponent @xmath0 characterizing the anomalous decay of density correlations : @xmath50 .",
    "values of the exponents @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath0 differ between rws and saws . in this paper",
    "we deal only with _ ideal polymers _ model for which @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "presence of scale - invariant boundaries modifies the behavior of polymers . in the expression for the number of configurations @xmath47 ,",
    "the leading _ non - universal _",
    "part @xmath52 remains unchanged !",
    "similarly , there is no change in the correlation length exponent @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath48 characterizing the _ subleading _ @xmath53-dependence of @xmath54 changes its value .",
    "( for flat surfaces it is frequently denoted @xmath55 @xcite , while for wedges with opening angle @xmath56 it is sometimes denoted @xmath57 @xcite . ) as their free space counterparts , these exponents do not depend on the microscopic details of the hamiltonian , but their values _ do depend _ on the type of the limiting surface .",
    "exponent @xmath0 describing the behavior of the correlation functions is also affected by the presence of the surface .",
    "however , fisher s relation , which is a consequence of the fact that the total number of states is an integral of the correlation function , remains valid even in those modified circumstances ; e.g. , for a flat surface @xmath58 , where @xmath59 describes the power - law dependence of the correlation function in any direction except parallel to the surface @xcite .",
    "this relation persists also for wedges and cones . in our problem",
    ", all the exponents correspond to specific surfaces under consideration and we omit the various subscripts used in the literature . since we are considering only _ ideal polymers _ ,",
    "fisher s relation for our surface - specific exponents reduces to @xmath60 leading to @xmath61 . by comparing this expression with eq .   with @xmath18",
    "we see that this is the same exponent @xmath0 as was defined in the diffusion problem for the same type of surface .",
    "our goal is to establish numerical value of the exponent @xmath0 in a variety of geometries for ideal polymers . in simple geometries [ such as circular cones ( in @xmath62 ) or wedges ( in @xmath63 ) ] this exponent is known analytically @xcite .",
    "( in some cases , @xmath0 is known even for polymers in good solvents @xcite , where it is found by studying numerically saws in @xmath62 for flat surfaces @xcite and for circular cones or cone - plane geometries @xcite . )",
    "polymers can mediate forces between two surfaces . consider a polymer attached by one end to a special point of one sf surface that is brought close ( distance @xmath64 ) from a special point of another sf surface .",
    "as an example , we may consider a polymer attached to an apex of a cone that is being brought into the vicinity of a plane .",
    "this resembles measurements done by means of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite , where a long molecule is attached to the sharp tip of a probe and the probe is brought into the vicinity of a flat stage .",
    "( however , in a typical experimental situation the _ other _ end of the polymer is also attached to the stage . )",
    "the loss of polymer entropy leads to entropic force between the two objects @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a dimensionless prefactor .",
    "this relation is true only for @xmath64 much smaller than the root mean squared end - to - end distance of the polymer .",
    "( in the absence of any additional length scales , this is the only possible dimensionally correct expression for the force . )",
    "the change in free energy of the polymer when bringing one object into contact with the second one is due to the change in entropy @xmath67 .",
    "both the initial and final states of the system ( but not the intermediate ones ) are sf and can be characterized using the exponents @xmath0 .",
    "the difference in the entropy ( and free energy ) of the two states must be equal to the work performed by the force .",
    "since the leading exponential part of the number of states @xmath52 , which corresponds to the leading _ extensive _ part of the entropy and free energy , is identical in both sf situations , the difference in the free energies is proportional to the difference of the subleading terms @xmath68 .",
    "comparison of this relation with the integral of the force in eq .   over the separation @xmath64 between a microscopic distance @xmath12 and the maximal interaction distance",
    "@xmath69 fixes the value of the prefactor @xcite : @xmath70 thus , the force between two surfaces , mediated by the polymer , depends solely on the geometry of the surfaces through the exponents @xmath0 corresponding to the initial and the final states .",
    "equations and have been derived @xcite by assuming equilibrium conditions .",
    "long equilibration times of polymers @xcite make the equilibrium measurements of force - position relations a difficult task .",
    "for _ slightly _ non - equilibrium energy - dominated experimental situations crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite can be used to recover some equilibrium properties from non - equilibrium experiments @xcite .",
    "since calculation of the force constant has been reduced to finding @xmath0 in sf geometries , our aim is to consider simple methods for accomplishing this task . for ideal polymers in high symmetry systems , such as three - dimensional problem of a circular cone [ fig .",

    "( such solutions can also be obtained in arbitrary @xmath11 . )",

    "is located a few lattice constants away from the apex .",
    "probability density is shown at ( a ) @xmath72 and ( b ) @xmath73 .",

    "@xmath10 will resemble free space solution uninfluenced by the boundaries",

    "it is possible to verify directly that this expression solves the differential eq .  ,",
    "provided @xmath40 and @xmath0 are solutions of eq .  .",
    "this solution , however , does not satisfy the exact initial conditions , and can be used only for sufficiently long times . in the absence of geometric length scale , the distance @xmath81 from the apex in eq .",
    "can be only compared with @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the shape of the function does not change over time except for being stretched .",
    "figure  [ fig : selfsimilar ] depicts the numerical solution for a diffusing particle inside a circular cone with absorbing boundaries calculated on a cubic lattice .",
    "the simulation begins with the particle situated on a lattice site close to the apex of the cone and the probability is then evolved by using discrete diffusion equation , i.e. , the probability at a particular lattice site ( inside the permitted space ) at time @xmath13 is equal to the mean of the probabilities at the neighboring sites at time @xmath5 .",
    "the absorbing boundary conditions are implemented by keeping probability 0 outside the permitted space .",
    "due to the absorption , the total survival probability decreases .",

    "numerically , this can be accomplished by simply summing up all the probabilities at several times @xmath5 and extrapolating the _ slope _ of the graph ( on a logarithmic scale ) to large times .",
    "the method presented below offers a slightly more convenient alternative into measuring @xmath0 .",
    "we notice that the exponential term in eq .",
    "is exactly the same as it would be in the absence of boundaries .",
    "the absorbing boundaries generate the time - dependent ( power law ) prefactor , as well as term @xmath89 . while the probability density in eq .",
    "is not normalized due to absorbtion , we may calculate the mean squared distance @xmath90 of a _ surviving _ particle from the apex @xmath91 . in this ratio of integrals , the prefactors and",
    "the angular integrals cancel out , and we are left with the ratio of two simple integrals leading to @xmath92 note , that in the absence of boundaries @xmath93 , and the above result reduces to the well - known free - space expression @xmath94 . for large time , @xmath90 coincides with mean - squared traveled distance by the walker , or mean squared end - to - end distance of an ideal @xmath53-step polymer for @xmath95 .",
    "since the numerical evolution of the diffusion equation is a very simple task , we can use eq .   to calculate exponent @xmath0 , by finding the large @xmath5 limit of @xmath96",
    "of course , for finite times we expect corrections due to discreteness of the lattice , presence of ragged boundaries on a lattice , and due to the fact that the walker begins its path few lattice constants away from the apex .",
    "each of these problems has a typical length scale of the order of lattice constant @xmath12 , and their influence will disappear when the dimensionless ratio @xmath97 .",
