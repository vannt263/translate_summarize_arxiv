    "the last three decades have seen the birth of exo - planetary science . with the advent of various techniques , which include , but are not limited to , pulsar timing @xcite , doppler measurements @xcite , transit photometry @xcite , micro - lensing @xcite and direct imaging @xcite , thousands of planets have been detected orbiting distant stars .",
    "a central focus is the detection of so - called _ exo - earths _ , earth - like planets in terms of mass and radius , orbiting around a star at a distance ( _ the goldilocks zone _ ) that , given sufficient atmospheric pressure , would allow for the existence of liquid water on its surface ( e.g * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the techniques that are most commonly used in discovering other planets are transit photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) or doppler measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recently , using the transit method , detection of 9 candidates for habitable planets was announced that may fall within the habitable zones of their host stars @xcite .",
    "whilst the combination of these approaches have provided an impressive range of observations , the detection of earth analogs is a challenging problem .",
    "indeed , the presence of instrumental and astrophysical noise are sources of uncertainty for such discoveries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fingerprints of an exo - earth could easily be hidden in stellar noise , or stellar signals might mimic the presence of an exoplanet . moreover ,",
    "when such noise is modeled , there is a risk of introducing spurious signals in the analysis of data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contemporary studies aim to understand and correctly evaluate the imprint of stellar activity on exoplanet detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , radial velocity and transit photometry methods can still produce false detections , especially when dealing with earth - like planets , or planets characterized by a signal @xmath11 m s@xmath2 @xcite , which is in part due to the models upon which these methods are based .",
    "such exoplanet evolution and stellar models over - fit parameters to the data , which turns out to be crucial when one aims to detect terrestrial - like planets @xcite .",
    "these parameters include , but are not limited to , planet and stellar radius , their masses , eccentricity , impact factor , transit duration , transit ingress / egress duration , transit depth , orbital inclination , distance of planet from the star , limb - darkening parameters ( which themselves may vary on the law used ) , and shape of the transit curve . in some cases , instrumental signals such as the wobble of the instrument cluster aboard the spitzer satellite or the latent charge build - up in the pixels ( ramp ) are also modeled @xcite .",
    "additionally , noise sources such as granulation over the stellar surface employ model fitting to estimate the effect of that noise on the data @xcite , stellar activity concurrent with the stellar rotation are modeled by fitting sine waves through the radial velocity data , and long term stellar activity , light contamination from near by stars , among others are parametrically modeled .",
    "this fitting of models has led to the introduction of spurious signals in the observed data and hence to false detections .    in order to fit these stellar models to data",
    ", one must begin by considering a particular system , for example an unblended eclipsing binary or a transiting planet .",
    "hence the list of models that the data can represent needs to be complete , which constitutes a weakness for these types of fitting scheme @xcite .",
    "moreover , these methods can not always distinguish whether the signal is instrumental or from stellar activity @xcite .",
    "finally , because it affects the details of the fitting and hence the results , the observations must have a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a key aspect of the analysis of exo - planetary systems is the identification of periodic timescales .",
    "this is also central to the study of multi - planetary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and often requires the combined use of the two most successful approaches in exoplanet searches ; the transit and radial velocity methods .",
    "the most widely used method for identifying periodic timescales is the lomb - scarge periodogram , which is based on the assumption that the data can be interpreted as a sum of periodic signals .",
    "however , this technique is used on data that have been `` filtered '' using models for stellar noise and terrestrial atmospheric contamination .",
    "hence , it is again possible to accumulate artifacts in the data through the use of such models .",
    "many approaches have been developed by the exoplanetary science community to address these matters .",
    "for example , @xcite have compared state - of - the - art methods on simulated radial velocity data and concluded that the detection of planets below the 1 m s@xmath2 threshold is still controversial . moreover ,",
    "the extraction of radial velocities from spectra relies on cross - correlation techniques that are based on the use of spectral templates based on stellar models .",
    "therefore , the determination of the doppler shift remains a method - dependent challenge .",
    "for example , in the recent radial velocity study of proxima centauri @xcite , the use of terra algorithm @xcite rather than the harps pipeline , has been crucial for the quantification of the signal .    here , to extract the timescales that characterize a planetary system and stellar features without _ a priori _ assumptions about the data itself , we introduce a new approach to spectral analysis .",
    "namely , in the spirit of the langevin theory of brownian motion , we quantify a signal coming from a star as the combination of a deterministic dynamics and stochastic noise , but make no _ a priori _ assumptions about the nature of these processes , and thereby examine an unfiltered time series @xmath3 of a stellar spectral signal .",
    "if the star hosts a planetary system , the time scales associated with stellar rotation and activity , as well as with planetary motions must be present .",
    "we need not ( a ) make assumptions regarding the combination of periodic signals , or ( b ) use stellar models .",
    "the goal is to identify the dominant timescales of the observed system as agnostically as possible , and then use elementary geometry to reveal the underlying dynamics of the system .",
    "the flexibility of this approach , based on temporal multifractality , allows one to identify stellar signals that would otherwise be missed by fitting sine waves to the data .",
    "we begin with a description of the method in  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the proposed approach can be used both for transiting planets and for radial velocity measurements .",
    "we show two examples in  [ sec : data ] ; one for a transiting planet , and the other for a simulated observation of a planet detectable only via radial velocity measurements .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and their robustness in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , and conclude in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we analyze a series of spectra taken at an approximately constant time intervals .",
    "if each of these spectra spans a wavelength range of @xmath4 wavelengths , we construct @xmath4 time series , each of which consists of the flux measured at a given wavelength . hence ,",
    "if we have @xmath5 equally - spaced - in - time spectra , we have @xmath4 time series of length @xmath5 .",
    "the time delay between spectral observations corresponds to the best obtainable resolution .    at each wavelength",
    "the variability of flux in time can arise from , among other things , the doppler shift , photometric effects , atmospheric / telluric effects , and instrumental noise , with characteristic time scales we aim to extract with our method .",
    "importantly , with no _ a priori _ knowledge of the dynamics of the system and without the use of model - fitting , we can extract the time scales associated with either a transiting planet or the doppler shift underlying planetary motion . in the former case we use elementary geometry to reconstruct time scales connected with the transit . in the latter case",
    "it is known that a doppler shift for stellar spectra can be caused both by an orbiting planet as well as by intrinsic stellar features , such as spots .",
    "we shall show that we can identify both of them , but to distinguish between them is the subject of future work .",
    "we analyze spectral time series using multi - fractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis ( mf - twdfa ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references herein ) , which does not _ a priori _ assume anything about the temporal structure of the data .",
    "the approach has four stages , which we describe briefly below .",
    "the behavior of @xmath27 depends on the choice of time segment @xmath11 for a given order @xmath28 of the moment taken .",
    "the principal focus is to study the scaling of @xmath27 as characterized by a generalized hurst exponent @xmath29 viz .",
    ", @xmath30 when @xmath29 is independent of @xmath28 the time series is said to be monofractal , in which case @xmath29 is equivalent to the classical hurst exponent @xmath31 . for @xmath28",
    "= 2 , regular mf - dfa and dfa are equivalent @xcite , and @xmath32 can also be related to the decay of the power spectrum @xmath33 . if @xmath34 , with frequency @xmath35 then @xmath36 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for white noise @xmath37 = 0 and hence @xmath38 , whereas for brownian or red noise @xmath39 and hence @xmath40 .",
    "the dominant timescales in the data set are the points where the fluctuation function @xmath41 changes slope with respect to @xmath42 . at each wavelength",
    "a crossover in the slope of a fluctuation function is calculated if the change in slope of the curve exceeds a set threshold , @xmath43 . because the window length is constrained as @xmath44 @xcite , this analysis is limited to time scales of @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite studied stellar features by focusing on time - series observations of h and k lines of ca ii .",
    "their method constructs diagrams based on the concept of pooled variance , and has been subsequently used in other analyses of stellar activity @xcite .",
    "pooled variance is defined as the mean variance at a particular time scale , @xmath46 , by stepping through a time series in consecutive bins of size @xmath46 and calculating the variance within each bin .",
    "a pooled variance diagram ( pvd ) plots this mean variance versus @xmath46 , thereby examining the time - scale dependence of the mean variance .",
    "the key differences between a pvd and our method are as follows .",
    "first , while a pvd computes a mean variance of the data itself , mf - twdfa examines the variability relative to temporally weighted fit to the profile of the data , thereby exploiting the intuition that points closer in time are more likely to be related than more distant points .",
    "second , because the procedure of mf - twdfa produces a smooth profile of the data , which is the core time series analyzed , it does not suffer from the intrinsic noise present in the data ( see fig .",
    "4 of * ? ? ?",
    "third , in mf - twdfa the fluctuation functions are calculated for an arbitrary range of moments ( up to ten in geophysical data ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both positive and negative , thereby providing a rich tapestry of the temporal dynamics underlying variability , as well as explicit information about the processes producing them ( e.g , pink or brown noise processes ) .",
    "finally , to the best of our knowledge pvd s have not been used to quantify exoplanetary time scales .",
    "to test the method described in ",
    "[ sec : method ] we apply it to three different kinds of data .",
    "the first two are spectral observations of hd 189733b , a well known transiting exoplanet discovered in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the third is a set of simulated stellar spectra affected by the doppler shift induced by an orbiting planet .",
    "these simulated data are obtained with the spot oscillation and planet ( soap ) 2.0 tool @xcite .      first detected in 2005",
    "@xcite , hd 189733b is a hot jupiter orbiting the star hd 189733a in the constellation vulpecula , approximately 63 light years away from earth .",
    "we use spectral data for hd 189733b to test our method of extracting time scales related to the effects of a transiting planet .",
    "we employ both ground - based observations ( high - resolution in wavelength ) and space - based observations ( low - resolution in wavelength ) to test if and how the analysis is affected by resolution , instrumental noise , and the terrestrial atmosphere .",
    "the ground - based observations are obtained from the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher _ harps _",
    "spectrograph @xcite , and the space - based observations are from the nasa spitzer space mission .      these are reduced 1-d spectral data from the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher at the eso la silla 3.6 m telescope for planet hd 189733b . programs 072.c-0488(e ) , 079.c-0127(a ) and 079.c-0828(a ) are used from the european southern observatory ( eso ) archive ( see table [ t : harps ] ) .",
    "these data cover four nights , but that from the fourth night has been removed from this analysis as it is known to have been affected by severe weather @xcite . each night",
    "is treated as an independent data set . on night 1 , these spectra are taken approximatively every 10.5 minutes , and on nights 2 and 3 every 5.5 minutes .",

    "we use data produced with the soap 2.0 tool @xcite .",
    "these spectra are generated by filling a grid of cells with a telluric cleaned solar spectrum from national solar observatory , simulating a rotating star .",
    "depending on the grid cell position , the spectrum is doppler shifted to account for stellar rotation , and the intensity of each cell is weighted by a limb - darkening law . to simulate the presence of a spot , a typical spectrum of a solar spot is enclosed in a cell",
    "additionally , the intensity is reduced in the presence of a dark spot or increased in the presence of a bright plage .",
    "such features follow the rotation of the star .",
    "the final integrated spectrum is the sum of the spectra from all of the cells .",
    "first , we use stellar spectra in the absence of stellar spots and thus influenced solely by an orbiting planet .",
    "this allows us to focus on , for example , the `` bare '' effect of the doppler shift on the spectra .",
    "because we would like to examine orbital periods , we stack the 25 spectra corresponding to the orbital period of the planet to provide 8 orbital periods worth of data .",
    "because the time units are arbitrary , the analysis can be compared to a wide range of observations , provided they are evenly spaced in time . moreover , since we are interested in the effect of noise on our data analysis , gaussian white noise with a specific signal to noise ratio ( snr ) per resolution element is then added at each time to obtain data sets with different snrs .",
    "this is important for the comparison of results obtained with this simulated dataset to real observations from spectrographs characterized by different snrs .",
    "second , we use stellar spectra in the absence of a planet and thus influenced solely by a stellar spot .",
    "this allows us to focus on the `` bare '' effect of a spot , which can in principle mimic the doppler shift in radial velocity measurements induced by a spot . here",
    "again as we have 25 spectra corresponding to one full rotation period of the star , we stack these to give 8 rotation periods worth of data , and then add gaussian white noise as in the first ( planet only ) case discussed above .",
    "the spot covers 5% of the star , has a contrast of 663 k and it is set to rotate on the stellar equator ( i.e. , a latitude of 0 degrees ) .",
    "the star rotates `` equator - on '' , meaning the rotational axis is at 90 degrees relative to the line of sight .",
    "we have selected such values in order to deal with the simplest possible realistic observational case . for each of these spectra",
    "the continuum has been subtracted .",
    "the 1-d spectra from the harps instrument provide the time series for flux at each of the wavelengths for each night separately .",
    "these are analyzed using multi - fractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis as described in ",
    "[ sec : method ] above .",
    "the second moment of the associated fluctuation functions are shown in figures [ fig : n1_complete]a , [ fig : n1_complete]b and [ fig : n1_complete]c for nights 1 , 2 and 3 respectively . in all of the fluctuation functions ,",
    "wavelength generally increases in positive y - direction .",
    "the key aspects of the fluctuation functions are as follows .",
    "first , nearly all of these curves are parallel to each other , demonstrating that the spectra evolve in time with a similar noisy behavior at all wavelengths .",
    "second , those fluctuation functions that show deviations , do so principally at smaller wavelengths and can thus be ascribed to atmospheric interference from the earth or the exoplanet , such as variability of air masses , telluric contamination and/or turbulent effects .",
    "third , for all nights and all the wavelengths we see a timescale of @xmath47 minutes .",
    "fourth , for times larger than 85 minutes , the dynamics for all wavelengths exhibit a white noise structure .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cp_harps ] we plot all of the times at which the slope of the fluctuation functions changes  the crossover times  for the three nights for all of the wavelengths . the robustness of the 85 minute time scale is reflected by its presence for all nights , whereas other times scales are present for only one or two nights .",
    "lines at shorter times only appear to be continuous due to the large number of points , but are in fact quite noisy as shown by the fluctuation functions .",
    "possible origins of the other time scales include turbulent and convective processes in earth s and the exoplanet s atmosphere , stellar activity or instrumental noise .",
    "it is important that we have identified these scales here and this provides a foundation for systematic examination of them in future studies as a possible mean of systematically filtering them .    to understand this 85 minute time scale , we study the following parameters of the planet hd 189733b , as found from previous studies : ( 1 ) the ratio of the planetary ( @xmath48 ) to the stellar ( @xmath49 ) radii , @xmath50 @xcite , and ( 2 ) the duration of the transit of the planet in front of the star @xmath51 , or the time between first and last `` contact '' of the planet and the star @xcite ( see figure [ fig : exotransit ] ) .    due to the time - resolution of the data for each night , as well as",
    "the total length of these time series , we are not able to observe the shortest and the longest time scales in the system .",
    "the @xmath47 minute time scale corresponds to the interval between the second and third contact of the planet , @xmath52 , i.e. , the period during which the planet is completely between the observer and the star ( figure [ fig : exotransit ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the planet is transiting in the equatorial plane of the star , and hence the impact parameter is @xmath53 , we calculate this time by tracking the center of the planetary disk across the stellar disk as @xmath54 from which we obtain @xmath55 , using @xmath56 from @xcite . within the resolution of the time series ,",
    "this value of @xmath52 is consistent with the 85 minute time scale we have found .",
    "the timescale of the full transit @xmath57 would generally be the dominant timescale of the system . because the rossiter - mclaughlin effect for this system operates on the same timescale @xcite",
    ", it might underlie the spectral modifications detected here .",
    "our method only works up to @xmath58 , namely half the duration of the observational time , @xmath59 , and thus due to the length of the time series from the harps data , the method does not allow @xmath57 to be detected . to test how wavelength - resolution affects our results , we degrade the resolution of the spectra in wavelength and repeat our analysis",
    ". we decrease the resolution by a factor 100 by using the average of each 100 points , and plot the fluctuation functions for the degraded spectra from night 1 in figure [ fig : n1_lowres ] .",
    "clearly , the structure at longer time scales is unchanged , whereas the noisy behavior at short wavelengths is less evident than in the analysis of high resolution spectra , showing that the averaging acts as a crude high - pass filter .",
    "importantly , the @xmath47 minute scale persists as does the general behavior of the fluctuation functions for this reduction in resolution .      because stars can only be observed at night , all earth based instruments provide a strong constraint on the detection of time scales . moreover , telluric contamination is a well known problem that is also evident in our method at the shorter timescales in the harps data . to bypass these limitations ,",
    "we examine data from the spitzer mission , which observed hd189733b for 22 nights , looking at the secondary eclipses of the planet , i.e. , when the planet is behind the star .",
    "although the data from spitzer is of low resolution in wavelength space , this does not affect the identification of robust time scales , which we have demonstrated in the case of the harps data by comparing the results using full resolution data with those from degraded data .",
    "regardless of the wavelength resolution , the time resolution as well as the total duration make the spitzer datasets compelling .",
    "as was done in figure [ fig : cp_harps ] , we plot these crossovers as a function of wavelength in figure [ fig : spitzerd1 ] .",
    "it is clear that relative to the harps data the spitzer data is substantially more noisy .",
    "we note that typically the raw data are filtered to remove the noisy characteristics , but given experience with other systems @xcite we take the perspective that noise can be an essential source of information .",
    "the four prominent timescales in this data are ( 1 ) @xmath60 15.4804 @xmath61 3.7660 minutes , ( 2 ) 55.0966 @xmath61 5.8851 minutes , ( 3 ) @xmath62 87.0947 @xmath61 2.7888 minutes , and ( 4 ) @xmath63 118.9671 @xmath61 5.5764 minutes , where the uncertainty is one standard deviation about the mean .",
    "first , the 55.0966 @xmath61 5.8851 minute timescale is the pointing wobble in the infrared array camera of the spitzer telescope , which is due to the battery heater in the telescope @xcite .",
    "secondly , the @xmath47 minute timescale obtained from the harps data is within one standard deviation of @xmath52 and hence is robust .",
    "the other two timescales are related to the transit of the planet behind the star , namely the secondary eclipse .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for these timescales to represent the transit ( figure [ fig : exotransit ] ) is @xmath64 it is evident that , within one standard deviation , equation [ eq : duration ] is satisfied for the above timescales .    because @xmath65 , the spitzer datasets span a sufficient time to allow the detection of the secondary eclipse time scale @xmath57 . using the values for @xmath57 and @xmath52",
    ", we can then estimate the ratio of the radius of the planet to that of the star by rearranging equation [ eq : transit ] to obtain @xmath66 therefore , we have shown here that without the use of any fitting of model parameters such as the epoch of mid - transit , orbital period , fractional flux deficit , total duration of transit , the impact parameter of planet s path across the stellar disc , the transit depth , the shape parameter for transit , the transit ingress / egress times and many more @xcite , we can now calculate most of these from the time scales alone @xcite .",
    "we note that , to within the precision of @xmath67 , the result in equation [ eq : ratio ] is the same as that found by @xcite and the average of that found by @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we did not take into account the possibility that the planet may be transiting with a non - zero impact parameter ( @xmath68 , where @xmath69 implies the planet is transiting the equator of the star from the observer s perspective ) . this would add another unknown in equation [ eq : ratio ] . by using the simple geometry shown in figure [ fig : ip ] , another equation can be derived that also involves @xmath70 .",
    "each of these two second order equations can be solved to determine the relationship between the ratio of radii and the impact parameter , as follows .",
    "first we can write @xmath71 , the distance between the first - second or third - fourth contact from the pythagorean theorem as @xmath72 second , @xmath73 , the distance between the second - third contact is @xmath74 and finally we have @xmath75 therefore , @xmath76 which , upon substitution of eqs [ eq : d23 ] and [ eq : d14 ] , gives @xmath77 where @xmath78 . similarly , eqs [ eq : d12 ] and [ eq : d14 ] give @xmath79 and thus eqs .",
    "[ eq : ratio1 ] and [ eq : ratio2 ] can be used to calculate @xmath80 and @xmath81 simultaneously . as a check , eqs .",

    "[ fig : spitzer ] we show the crossovers from all the available datasets , as shown in table [ t : spitzer ] .",
    "additionally , figure [ fig : spitzer ] includes those data sets that are not used in other studies due to low signal to noise ratio , or other issues @xcite .",
    "moreover , we see the clear emergence of the significant time scales discussed above from _ all _ of these data sets .",
    "importantly we note the amount of noise in these data sets , which as we will see below can be a source of information for the robust estimation of these time scales .",

    ". however , these measurements are not always available since only a small percentage of exoplanet transits occur between the observer and the host star . instead",
    ", all the exoplanets produce an effect on the radial velocity of the host star .",
    "current technology only allows detection of the red and blue shifts of the spectrum when the motion of the star is sufficiently large , and although modern high - resolution spectrographs can attain a resolution of the order of 1 m s@xmath2 , detections of a small planets often remain controversial .",
    "moreover , these data are contaminated with a wide variety of noise , such as instrumental noise , atmospheric noise , stellar noise , telluric absorption lines . presently , the observations are fit to a radial velocity curve , which may or may not be robust and have a non - negligible false detection rate ( see sect 4.3.2 . of * ? ? ?",

    "we start from the analysis of a well defined case using data from the soap 2.0 simulations .",
    "this allows us to study the effect of noise as well as the robust estimation of crossover times , which we know to be present in the data set .",

    "we add gaussian white noise to the spectra at each time to get a specific snr , and thereby obtain 12 such data sets for snr 1 , 10 , 50 , 75 , 80 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 500 and 1000 . figure [ fig : soap_mf_planet ] shows the second moment of the fluctuation functions for all the wavelengths in the reduced spectra without noise , and subfigures in figure [ fig : soap_p2 ] show the crossover time scales extracted for the different noise cases . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we evaluate these crossovers using a threshold value @xmath43 for the slope change . the plots in figure [ fig : soap_p2 ] use a threshold value @xmath82 .",
    "whence , we are able to extract the exact timescale for the orbital period of the exoplanet . even for a @xmath83 , the methodology is efficient and robust against noise , and we extract the correct timescale . as the signal quality is degraded further , we see the noise starting to affect the calculated crossovers with scatter above the actual value .",
    "finally , as we further degrade the signal quality the crossover times disappear altogether .",
    "as the noise begins to dominate , the signal becomes white .",
    "we know this quantitatively from our analysis , as fluctuation functions with a constant slope of 0.5 are by definition white noise processes .",
    "to examine how to capture timescales when the signal quality is poor , we decrease the threshold to @xmath84 ( figure [ fig : soap_e2_p2 ] ) .",
    "even this threshold is able to approximately capture ( 31 time units ) the orbital period , but it also detects other multiple time scales , which may be spurious . the important point here is the ability to study how noise affects these timescales ; as the snr is decreased time scales remain robust , but become harmonics of the robust scales for further increase in the snr .",
    "these may be due to a form of stochastic resonance between the threshold , radial velocity measurements and noise .",
    "the value of threshold is thus crucial .    in actual data",
    ", one can not calculate this threshold for all the wavelengths separately and for each night , and hence one value is chosen in accordance with the observed noise characteristics .",
    "presently , use of periodograms and fitting to sine curves is done to model the radial velocity curves from the observations .",
    "the above analysis shows how noise can lead to spurious estimation of orbital periods thus potentially result in spurious detection of exoplanets .    in the same manner as above",
    ", we have analyzed the case in which no planet is orbiting around the star , but a spot covers 5% of its surface . in a similar fashion we have analyzed 8 rotation periods of the star and reconstructed its rotational period ( figure [ fig : soap_mf_spot ] , [ fig : soap_s ] and [ fig : soap__e2_s ] ) .",
    "the use of this method to distinguish stellar features from planets will be subject of future work .",
    "we have presented and tested a new multi - fractal approach to the analysis of exo - planetary spectral observations .",
    "the goal is to use a fit - free procedure to identify robust time scales associated with the exo - planetary orbital motion around a host star , as well as to detect time scales associated with stellar features . with these timescales in hand",
    ", one can compute key system parameters such as the ratio of the size of the planet to that of the star and latitude of transit , _ without _ use of stellar evolution models , data fitting , noise filtering , and the additional wide variety of other assumptions about the system that are typically made .",
    "the concept of the approach is to take an agnostic ( or model free ) view of the observed spectral structure .",
    "the method makes no _ a priori _ assumptions about the temporal structure in any observed spectra and makes use of only one number , the generalized hurst exponent , the value of which underlies the identification of the key time scales .",
    "we have reconstructed the primary and secondary transit times of the exoplanet hd 189733b , using data from both ground - based ( harps spectrograph ) and space - based ( spitzer ) observations .    using the soap 2.0 tool , which simulates a stellar spectrum and how it can be affected by the presence of a planet across one orbital period",
    ", our method is further tested in the context of measuring planetary orbital motion via doppler shift detection .",
    "because the soap tool can also simulate the presence of a spot on the stellar surface across one rotational period of the star , we have demonstrated that our approach reconstructs the planetary orbital period , as well as the rotation period of a spot covering 5% of the stellar surface .",
    "moreover , we have tested the analysis with a wide range of signal to noise ratios .",
    "we can reconstruct ( a ) the period of a planet producing a 40 m s@xmath2 doppler shift of the stellar spectrum , and ( b ) the rotational period of the star , based on the presence of a spot on its surface , provided that the signal to noise ratios are @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "importantly , to avoid introduction of errors arising from intrinsic irregularities in the analyzed time series , this method has the highest fidelity when observations are carried out at sufficiently high frequency that the time - difference between each measurement is less than the shortest relevant timescale that may be present in the system .    in conclusion",
    "this method based on multi - fractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis of time series is a robust way to measure planetary orbital motion .",
    "it provides a fertile framework to examine other data sets and to explore trying to systematically distinguish stellar noise from planetary motion .",
