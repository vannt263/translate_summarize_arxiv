    "in his groundbreaking paper @xcite , j. dixmier proved the existence of singular traces ( that is , linear positive unitarily invariant functionals which vanish on all finite dimensional operators ) on the algebra @xmath1 of all bounded linear operators acting on infinite - dimensional separable hilbert space @xmath2 namely , if @xmath3 is a concave increasing function such that @xmath4 then there is a singular trace @xmath5 defined for every positive compact operator @xmath6 by setting @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is an arbitrary dilation invariant singular state on the algebra @xmath9 of all bounded sequences and @xmath10 is the sequence of singular values of the compact operator @xmath6 taken in the descending order .",

    "( see also @xcite ) that @xmath25 possesses the following fundamental property , namely if @xmath26 are such that @xmath27 then @xmath28 such a class of traces was termed fully symmetricin @xcite , @xcite ( see also earlier papers @xcite,@xcite , where the term symmetricwas used ) .",
    "it is natural to consider such traces only on fully symmetric operator ideals @xmath29 ( that is , on symmetric operator ideals @xmath29 satisfying the condition : if @xmath30 satisfy and @xmath31 then @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "in fact , it was established in @xcite that every marcinkiewicz ideal @xmath14 with @xmath15 satisfying the condition possesses fully symmetric traces .",
    "furthermore , in the recent paper @xcite , the following unexpected result was established .",

    "he was probably , the first who suggested that dixmier construction works on the symmetric operator ideals different from marcinkiewicz ideals .",
    "more precisely , given a positive function @xmath15 on @xmath33 ( wodzicki did not assume this function to be either increasing or concave ) , one can construct a mapping @xmath34 applying some limiting procedure to the latter sequence ( wodzicki used stone - ech compactification for this purpose ) , we are left with a question whether this construction produces a trace .",
    "if it does , then it is natural to refer to such a trace as to the dixmier trace .",
    "wodzicki proved ( a very complicated ) criterion for the additivity of multiplicative renormalisation ( see theorem 3.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "the questions of finiteness and non - triviality , also considered in @xcite , happen to be even harder .",
    "in fact , it is proved in @xcite that , for every principal ideal , multiplicative renormalisation produces a trace if and only if the ideal admits a trace .",
    "the latter result still relates to the realm of marcinkiewicz operator ideals and can be compared with @xcite .",
