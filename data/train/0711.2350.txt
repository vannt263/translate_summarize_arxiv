    "in this paper we give a family of unknot diagrams @xmath2 with @xmath2 having @xmath3 crossings and with at least @xmath4 reidemeister moves required to transform @xmath2 to the trivial diagram .",
    "these are the first examples for which a non - linear lower bound has been established .    a knot in @xmath5 or @xmath6 is commonly represented by a knot diagram , a generic projection of the knot to a plane or 2-sphere .",
    "a diagram is an immersed oriented planar or spherical curve with finitely many double points , called crossings .",
    "each crossing is marked to indicate a strand , called the overcrossing , that lies above the second strand , called the undercrossing .",
    "the original knot can be recovered , up to isotopy , by constructing a curve with the overcrossing arcs pushed slightly above the plane of the diagram and the remainder of the diagram lying in this plane .",
    "alexander and briggs  @xcite and independently reidemeister  @xcite showed that two diagrams of the same knot can be connected through a sequence of moves of three types , commonly called reidemeister moves , shown in figure  [ reidmoves ] .",
    "the number of such moves required to connect two equivalent diagrams is difficult to estimate .",
    "an exponential upper bound is obtained in  @xcite , where it is shown that there is a positive constant @xmath7 such that given an unknot diagram @xmath8 with @xmath9 crossings , no more than @xmath10 reidemeister moves are required to transform @xmath8 to the trivial knot diagram .",
    "we can get some lower bounds by looking at classical invariants of diagrams such as crossing numbers , writhes and winding numbers , since a single reidemeister move changes these numbers by 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "however non - trivial lower bounds are difficult to obtain .",
    "this is a common situation in complexity theory .",
    "while upper bounds can be established by careful analysis of one procedure , lower bounds require somehow bounding from below the running time of all possible procedures .",
    "it is quite difficult to get lower bounds even for a particular pair of equivalent diagrams , as seen in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that examples are constructed in @xcite that show that it may require exponentially many faces to construct a pl spanning disk for an unknotted polygon .",
    "however these examples can be transformed to the trivial diagram using only a linear number of reidemeister moves .    given two knot diagrams @xmath11 of the same knot , we define the _ reidemeister distance _ @xmath12 between @xmath8 and @xmath13 to be the minimal number of reidemeister moves required to pass from @xmath8 to @xmath13 .",
    "one may consider this notion in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and our result will hold in both settings .",
    "our main tool is an invariant of knot diagrams developed in @xcite , and used there to obtain new linear lower bounds on the reidemeister distance .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the trivial knot diagram . we will present a sequence @xmath2 of diagrams of the unknot , for which @xmath15 , the number of reidemeister moves required to pass from @xmath2 to @xmath14 grows quadratically with respect to the number of crossings of @xmath2 . more precisely ,",
    "we prove :      we will prove the lower bound in @xmath0 , and the upper bound in @xmath1 , and it follows that both bounds hold in both settings .",
    "we recall the definition of the invariant of knot diagrams in @xmath0 introduced in hassnowik .",
    "we denote the set of all knot diagrams in @xmath0 by @xmath17 and the set of all two component links in @xmath5 by @xmath18 . given a knot diagram @xmath19 and a crossing @xmath20 in @xmath8 , define @xmath21 to be the two component link obtained by smoothing the crossing @xmath20 .",
    "given a knot diagram @xmath8 , let @xmath22 denote the set of all positive crossings in @xmath8 and @xmath23 the set of all negative crossings .",
    "given an invariant of two component links @xmath24 where @xmath25 is any set , let @xmath26 be the free abelian group with basis @xmath27 .",
    "we then define the invariant @xmath28 to be @xmath29    in this work @xmath30 is taken to be the linking number , @xmath31 , giving the invariant @xmath32 . in hassnowik",
    "it is shown that the change in the value of @xmath33 resulting from a reidemeister move has one of the following forms :      let @xmath40 be the set of elements in @xmath41 of the form @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and their negatives .",
    "that is , @xmath40 is the set of all elements of @xmath41 that may appear as the change in the value of @xmath44 as the result of performing a reidemeister move on @xmath8 .",
    "the set @xmath40 generates @xmath41 and the length of an element of @xmath41 with respect to this generating set is called its _ @xmath40-length_. given two diagrams @xmath45 of the same knot , the @xmath40-length of @xmath46 is a lower bound for @xmath47 in @xmath0 , and therefore also in @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath8 is a diagram of the unknot , then since @xmath48 , the @xmath40-length of @xmath44 gives a lower bound for @xmath49 .",
    "we use this procedure to obtain our lower bound for @xmath50 .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ main ] . *",
    "a computation shows that @xmath51 indeed , each crossing in the top horizontal string of @xmath52 crossings contributes @xmath53 , each crossing in the bottom horizontal string of @xmath54 crossings contributes @xmath35 , each crossing in the left vertical line of @xmath9 crossings contributes @xmath35 , each crossing in the middle vertical line of @xmath9 crossing contributes @xmath55 , and each crossing in the right vertical line of @xmath9 crossings contributes @xmath56 .",
    "together this gives @xmath57 , and we denote this element of @xmath41 by @xmath58 .",
    "we prove theorem main by first showing that the @xmath40-length of @xmath58 is at least @xmath59 , and then demonstrating an explicit sequence of @xmath60 reidemeister moves in @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath14 .",
    "it remains to demonstrate an explicit sequence of @xmath60 reidemeister moves in @xmath1 , from @xmath2 to the trivial diagram .",
    "start by sliding the top horizontal string of @xmath52 crossings in figure  [ f1 ] in the clockwise direction , across the @xmath9 horizontal strands .",
    "this requires @xmath68 riii moves .",
    "then cancel these @xmath52 positive crossings with @xmath52 of the negative crossings , now lying to the left of them , via @xmath52 rii moves , arriving at the diagram in figure f2 . with @xmath9 additional rii moves",
    "we arrive at the diagram in figure f3 .",
    "finally , perform @xmath69 ri moves to get to the trivial diagram , resulting in a total of @xmath60 moves ."
