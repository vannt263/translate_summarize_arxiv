    "it has been suggested@xcite that the condensate fraction in the low density region near a @xmath1he surface is significantly larger than the value in bulk helium of 0.1@xcite .",
    "variational monte carlo ( vmc ) simulations by lewart and pandharipande@xcite of small ( @xmath2 ) @xmath1he droplets using a jastrow one - body ( job ) trial wave function give evidence for a condensate fraction which approaches unity as the density goes to zero in the helium surface .",
    "however , subsequent calculations by galli and reatto@xcite have shown that the condensate fraction throughout a helium surface computed using vmc is highly sensitive to the choice of trial wave function .",
    "they found that calculations performed using a shadow wave function with a glue term ( g - swf ) have enhanced density - density correlations at long wavelengths@xcite , and a maximum condensate fraction of only 0.5 .",
    "significant ripplon excitations are expected to reduce the condensate fraction at the surface , as fewer atoms are able to occupy the zero - momentum state .",
    "quantum evaporation experiments@xcite can be interpreted as providing evidence of an enhanced condensate fraction .    to avoid the problem of trial function bias and to include finite - temperature effects ,",
    "we have used path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) to calculate the density - density correlation functions and condensate fraction at the surface of liquid @xmath1he .",
    "we have also used imaginary - time correlation functions to calculate the dispersion relation of surface excitations in a free helium surface , and find good agreement with experimental thin film measurements .",
    "our simulation system consisted of @xmath1he atoms , interacting pair - wise with a very accurate potential@xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used with a box size and initial conditions chosen to favor a double - sided film oriented perpendicular to the z - axis . to maintain a stable film and minimize finite size effects , we added an external potential determined from the long - ranged part of the interaction potential and the missing atoms from the other side of the slab , so that atoms on each of the two surfaces saw a potential as if they were at the surface of a semi - infinite slab@xcite .",
    "most of the calculations were performed with @xmath3  k , with an imaginary time step of @xmath4  k@xmath5 .",
    "we performed simulations of helium slabs containing @xmath6 and @xmath7 atoms , with dimensions @xmath8    and @xmath9   , respectively .",
    "lower temperature calculations were also done to determine the temperature dependence .",
    "in order to determine the extent to which ripplons are present in a free helium surface , we estimated density - density correlations at the surface@xcite with the static structure factor defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the number of particles in the bin at position @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the wave vector parallel to the surface .",

    "k , for densities of @xmath19  @xmath20  and below there is a small enhancement of long - wavelength density - density correlations at @xmath21  @xmath5 , which is evidence for ripplons . however , the curves are closer to the vmc calculations of galli and reatto which used a job trial wave function than those which used the g - swf form .",
    "this does not imply that the job trial wave function is well - suited to representing an inhomogeneous helium system such as a helium slab , but rather the degree to which the g - swf significantly overestimates the effect of ripplons in a free helium surface .",

    "it is not clear whether @xmath59 has reached its asymptotic limit within the finite simulation box .",
    "thus , for @xmath6 at densities below @xmath60  @xmath20 our results are upper bounds to the condensate fraction .    the condensate fraction @xmath61 is plotted as a function of average density @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ slabnofr ] , for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 helium slabs .",
    "as one moves through the surface , the condensate fraction initially increases with decreasing density , due to the decreased zero - point motion from helium - helium interactions , reaching a maximum value of 0.93(3 ) at @xmath62  @xmath20 .",
    "as the average density decreases below this point , the condensate fraction begins to decrease , further evidence for correlated density fluctuations due to ripplons at the surface .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the g - swf vmc calculations of galli and reatto .",
    "however , the g - swf trial wave function significantly overestimates the degree to which ripplons are present in the surface .",
    "we find that the probability of a given atom belonging to a long exchange cycle does not change if that atom is located above the surface .",
    "hence the density fluctuations pulling atoms above the surface are accompanied by other ( exchanging ) atoms , in qualitative agreement with the ripplon model .",
    "but there is also present an appreciable fraction ( @xmath63 ) of non - exchanging atoms , possibly a result of finite temperature excitations .",
    "we have presented pimc calculations of the density - density correlation functions and condensate fraction at a free helium surface .",
    "these results support the model of a free helium surface with ripplons , in which the condensate fraction reaches a maximum at an intermediate density in the liquid - vacuum interface , before decreasing at lower densities .",
    "experimental probes of the surface will indeed see an enhanced condensate fraction as proposed by griffin and stringari@xcite .",
