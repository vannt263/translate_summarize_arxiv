    "the galactic chemical history can be reconstructed by studying the most metal - poor stars .",
    "of particular importance are direct age measurements of the oldest halo objects .",
    "such ages can be inferred by comparing the observed abundance ratios of the radioactive elements @xmath8th ( half - life of @xmath9gyr ) and @xmath10u ( @xmath11gyr ) with theoretical predictions of their initial production . in 2001",
    ", @xcite announced the first detection of u in an r - process enhanced metal - poor star , cs  31082 - 001 ( @xmath1 } = -2.9 $ ] ) . together with a th measurement ,",
    "this led to the novel use of the u / th ratio as a chronometer .",
    "this technique yielded an age of @xmath12gyr @xcite , in good agreement with the recent result of @xmath13gyr for the age of the universe , as determined from wmap data @xcite .",
    "the similarities of the neighboring nuclei th ( z=90 ) and u ( z=92 ) causes this cosmic clock to be much less prone to systematic uncertainties than the more widely used th / eu ( z=63 for eu ) chronometer @xcite .",
    "hence , it provides more reliable age estimates .",
    "it is thus important to attempt a u measurement in further metal - poor stars .",
    "the strongest u line at optical wavelengths is very weak , requiring very high quality spectroscopic data .",
    "additionally , it is located in the wing of a strong fe line and is blended with a cn feature .",
    "hence , low c and n abundances are vital for an accurate u abundance determination .",
    "it is thus not possible to measure u in c - rich r - process rich stars such as @xcite , for which only the th / eu chronometer can be employed .",
    "these observational difficulties explain why , currently , is the only known strongly r - process enhanced metal - poor star with a reliably measured u abundance @xcite . however , one further object is known to exhibit u ( v. hill et al . 2007 , in preparation ) , while for another one , at least a tentative detection has been made @xcite .    here",
    "we report the discovery of a strongly r - process enhanced star with a u measurement .",
    "this detection , in combination with other neutron - capture abundances , makes possible stellar nucleo - chronometry .",
    "the giant he  1523@xmath00901 ( @xmath14 ) was found in a sample of bright metal - poor stars @xcite from the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ) . based on an initial metallicity estimate of @xmath1 } = -2.7 $ ] , obtained from a medium - resolution ( @xmath15 ) spectrum , the star was observed with high spectral resolution ( @xmath16 ) with mike at the clay magellan telescope .",
    "the spectrum revealed a strong enhancement of heavy neutron - capture elements , and a tentative detection of u was made .",
    "to confirm the tentative u detection in he  1523@xmath00901 , new observations were obtained with the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ; @xcite ) at the eso very large telescope .",
    "the star was observed in service mode in 2005 august and 2006 april .",
    "we made use of the image slicer no . 2 and a @xmath1745 slit width to achieve a very high resolving power of @xmath18 .",
    "we employed the blue 346 nm setting covering 30503874 and the blue 437 nm setting covering 37584990 .",
    "the two settings conveniently overlap at @xmath19 where the u line is located .",
    "the total exposure time was 7.5h , of which 5h were spent with the blue 346 nm and 2.5h with the blue 437 nm setting .",
    "we use the pipeline reduced spectra provided by the eso data management and operations division .",
    "the frames , shifted to the stellar rest frame , are co - added .",

    "we determine an effective temperature of @xmath22k ( random error ) from dereddened @xmath23 ccd photometry @xcite and @xmath24 2mass data @xcite .",

    "the c ( @xmath36}=-0.15 $ ] ) and n ( @xmath41}=0.6 $ ] ) abundances employed in the u synthesis are well constrained by a good fit to the violet cn feature at 3883 .",
    "the u abundance is then obtained by simultaneously fitting the fe , cn , and u lines .",

    "a full discussion of the complete abundance analysis will be given elsewhere ( a.  frebel et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .    to test our derived abundances , we measured the th@xmath25 @xmath494019 and the u features in the spectrum of cs  31082 - 001 that was used by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ u_region ] shows the u region for cs  31082 - 001 ( crosses ) . despite differences in the employed model atmospheres",
    ", we obtain a @xmath50 ratio of @xmath51 for cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the published value of @xmath52 , as derived from these two lines .",
    "we estimate a fitting uncertainty of 0.05dex for the eu , os , ir , and th abundances .",
    "the u abundance is driven by the fit of the fe line close to the u line .",
    "changing the c by + 0.1dex results in only a @xmath53dex different u abundance . changing the fe abundance by",
    "+ 0.1dex changes the u abundance by @xmath54 .",
    "we adopt a 0.12dex uncertainty for u.",
    "there are three types of chronometers that involve the abundances of th , u and naturally occurring r - process elements @xcite .",
    "the subscript `` initial '' refers to the initial production ratio ( pr ) , while the subscript `` now '' refers to the observed value .",
    "*   *   *     using several different chronometers and prs , we derive a set of ages for he  1523@xmath00901 .",
    "the results are given in table  [ ages ] .",
    "where available , we list several prs for each chronometer to illustrate the available range and the subsequent spread in the derived ages .",
    "we take the weighted average of all the individual ages to derive a final age of @xmath7gyr for he  1523@xmath00910 .",
    "forming an average based on weights obtained from the uncorrelated observational uncertainties is an arbitrary choice which only minimizes the observational ( statistical ) uncertainties , but not necessarily the systematic ones .",
    "using different weights , for example by omitting the th / r ratios , would lead to slightly larger observational but smaller systematic uncertainties . a weighted observational uncertainty in the abundance ratios arising from the fitting procedure results in an 0.7gyr weighted uncertainty for the final age .",
    "this value is driven by the uncertainty of the uranium abundance measurement .",
    "we also investigate the influence by variations of model atmosphere parameters ( @xmath55 ) on the the stellar age . combining ( square - root of quadratic sum ) these three age uncertainties",
    "yields a 1.5gyr weighted uncertainty in the final age .",
    "any correlations of the different chronometers are thus automatically taken into account . to obtain an age uncertainty arising from the uncertainties in the prs",
    "we calculate @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is the age uncertainty from the different prs and @xmath59 the one from the observational uncertainty ) as an upper bound , assuming the worst possible correlation(s ) of the uncertainties in the prs .",
    "we thus derive a 2.7gyr weighted uncertainty in the final age . for the calculation of the pr uncertainties we followed schatz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who list overall systematic uncertainties for all three types of chronometers . in table",
    "[ ages ] , we list the five age uncertainties for all chronometers .    due to the much shorter half - life of u , uncertainties in ages derived from chronometers",
    "u / r are significantly smaller than for those from th / r . reducing the number of available chronometers by the th / r ones yields a weighted average of 13.4gyr .",
    "the observational uncertainty becomes 0.8gyr and the combined model atmosphere uncertainty is 0.9gyr , while the pr uncertainty is much reduced to 1.8gyr .",
    "this illustrates the superiority of the u / r ages in terms of systematic uncertainties . also , @xmath60gyr is roughly the age spread caused by the different prs for u / th .",
    "another advantage of the special case of u / th is that systematic observational uncertainties associated with model atmosphere parameters are less severe than for other ratios because the neighboring u and th nuclides have very similar atomic parameters .",
    "it follows that the u / th pr should be less sensitive to theoretical r - process model uncertainties compared with ratios of elements with larger mass separation such as the case of th to eu @xcite .",
    "however , in their extensive parameter study @xcite find very similar overall systematic uncertainties for the three chronometer types .    in order to derive reliable ages for individual metal - poor stars",
    "it is crucial to have available stars with a very precise u measurements together with the most accurate theoretical prs . only then can nucleo - chronometry be refined to deliver the best possible galactic stellar ages .",
    "for the first time it is possible to make use of _ all three _ types of chronometers in one star : th / r , u / r and u / th .",
    "previously , either the chronometer th / r was employed ( e.g. cs  22892 - 052 ; @xcite ) or only the ones based on the availability of u ( cs  31082 - 001 ; @xcite ) . also , the u / r chronometers , such as u / os or u / eu , for the first time deliver reasonable ages because , unlike cs 31082 - 001 ( see @xcite ) , he  1523@xmath00901 appears to follow the solar r - process pattern from ba all the way to u. given the observational and theoretical uncertainties , the consistency of the individual ages derived for he  1523@xmath00901 is remarkable .    since we also measure the u / th ratio in cs  31082 - 001 it is possible to determine a relative age of the two stars .",
    "we find he  1523@xmath00901 to be 1.5gyr younger than cs  31082 - 001 , which is _ independent _ of the employed production ratio .",
    "this age difference is based on only a 0.07dex difference in the observed u / th ratios .",
    "given that the observational uncertainties exceed that ratio difference as well as the uncertainties associated with initial production ratios , the present ages of the two stars suggest that they formed at roughly the same time .",
    "this is also reflected in their almost identical metallicity .",
    "we note that he  1523@xmath00901 is @xmath61k cooler than cs  31082 - 001 , which makes the lines in our star more prominent ( see figure  [ u_region ] ) .",
    "stellar age measurements such as these provide a lower limit to the age of the galaxy and hence , the universe . despite their large uncertainties the age limits provided by he  1523@xmath00901 and cs  31082 - 001 are in good agreement with the wmap result of 13.7gyr for the age of the universe .",
    "we note here that he  1523@xmath00901 is the first `` uranium star '' discovered in the he s .",
    "only a very few r - process enhanced stars are suitable for a detection of u because the objects need to be bright , sufficiently cool , strongly overabundant in heavy neutron - capture elements , and have low c and n abundances .",
    "it is of great importance , however , to find further `` uranium stars '' .",
    "this new group of objects will provide crucial observational constraints to the study of the r - process and its possible production site(s ) .",
    "they may also be used to empirically constrain the u / th production ratio , which , in turn , may provide the much - needed feedback for theoretical works to improve the initial production ratios .",
