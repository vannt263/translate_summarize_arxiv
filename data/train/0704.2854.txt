    "one of the central challenges in nuclear theory is to understand and predict the structure of nucleonic matter based on microscopic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and many - nucleon interactions . in recent years",
    ", there has been significant progress in exact calculations of ground and excited states of light nuclei based on various high - precision interactions fitted to nn data  @xcite .",
    "these results clearly show that three - nucleon forces ( 3nfs ) contribute significantly : without 3nfs , the binding energies depend strongly on the nn potential used , which can be traced to scheme and model dependences in any theory restricted to nn interactions .",
    "the existence of 3nfs is not surprising , since nucleons are not point particles .",
    "there are always virtual excitations ( high - momentum nucleons and @xmath1-isobars ) or internal degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) that have been `` integrated out '' .",
    "this directly leads to three- and many - nucleon interactions .",
    "the modern understanding is that nuclear interactions are effective interactions and depend on the resolution scale given by a cutoff @xmath2 of the effective theory ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "exact calculations are cutoff - independent up to the effects of omitted higher - order interactions , and therefore varying the resolution scale is a powerful tool to analyze the predictive power of theoretical calculations .",
    "the study of 3nfs in systems beyond the lightest nuclei is an important goal .",
    "this requires a flexible technique to solve the many - body problem including nn and 3n interactions .",
    "coupled - cluster theory is a promising tool for this endeavor .",
    "this method originated in nuclear physics  @xcite and is today mostly propelled through its importance in quantum chemistry  @xcite . for reviews ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite . after the seminal work by the bochum group  @xcite , heisenberg and mihaila employed coupled - cluster theory for structure calculations of @xmath3o based on realistic nn potentials  @xcite . for their calculation of the charge form factor of @xmath3o",
    ", they also included selected contributions from 3nfs that could be cast into the form of density - dependent nn interactions  @xcite .",
    "another recent approach employed _ ab - initio _ coupled - cluster theory for structure calculations in closed - shell nuclei @xmath0he and @xmath3o  @xcite , in open - shell nuclei as the neighbors of @xmath3o  @xcite , and weakly bound and unbound helium isotopes  @xcite .",
    "these calculations were limited to nn interactions .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to develop coupled - cluster theory for three - body hamiltonians .",
    "this extension of the coupled - cluster method might also find applications in condensed - matter theory and quantum chemistry  @xcite .",
    "a current frontier in nuclear structure theory is to determine consistent 3nfs corresponding to the different nn interactions , and with predictive power when extrapolated to the extremes of isospin and to moderate densities .",
    "several theoretical approaches are currently being used .",
    "the tucson - melbourne 3nf already employed symmetries of qcd in its construction  @xcite .",
    "existing phenomenological 3nfs include the fujita - miyazawa force based on @xmath4 exchange with an intermediate @xmath1-isobar  @xcite and also various shorter - ranged 3nfs  @xcite .",
    "this approach has led to a very successful description of light nuclei ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "onother approach is to systematically construct nn and higher - order interactions within the framework of chiral effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite .",
    "chiral interactions are expanded in powers of a typical momentum of nucleons in nuclei and in powers of the pion mass , both generically called @xmath5 , over the eft breakdown scale @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the eft power counting naturally explains the hierarchy of nn , 3n , and higher - body interactions  @xcite , which only enter in subleading orders and make calculations for complex nuclei based on nn and 3n interactions meaningful . at this point",
    ", the leading 3nf has been implemented  @xcite .",
    "nuclear interactions require regularization and renormalizaton to be meaningful , and with eft , usually a momentum cutoff scheme is used  @xcite .",
    "the description of the nn data is not completely independent of the cutoff , but the cutoff variation decreases with increasing order , because the cutoff dependences can be absorbed by higher - order contact interactions . in this way ,",
    "chiral eft implements the renormalization group ( rg ) running of the interactions up to higher - order terms .",
    "this is reflected in the leading chiral 3nf , which includes a 3n contact term to be fitted to 3n data . in principle , nuclear structure calculations based directly on chiral interactions are feasible  @xcite . however , the typical cutoffs ( @xmath8 ) are somewhat too large to use chiral interactions without resummations or prediagonalizations in many - body calculations .",
    "renormalization group methods can be used to evolve nuclear interactions to lower momenta , which leads to improved convergence in few- and many - body calculations  @xcite .",
    "the resulting low - momentum interactions , known generically as `` @xmath9 '' , have variable momentum cutoffs and are approximately independent of the starting nn interaction for cutoffs @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the rg evolution preserves the long - range parts , and starting from chiral eft interactions , generates all higher - order contact operators needed to reproduce low - energy nn observables .",
    "moreover , with increasing orders in eft , the resulting @xmath11 interactions are very similar to low - momentum interactions obtained from conventional potentials  @xcite . since chiral eft represents the most general low - momentum expansion of nuclear forces , the above observations motivate combining low - momentum interactions with 3nfs from chiral eft  @xcite .",
    "we will follow this approach and employ @xmath11 with the corresponding low - momentum 3nf adjusted to the binding energies of @xmath12h and @xmath0he  @xcite . in this way",
    ", we can expect to define approximately consistent nn and 3n interactions . in this first study , we focus on the development of the coupled - cluster method to include 3nfs and will only present results for one cutoff . a study of the cutoff variation and associated uncertainties due to higher - order many - body interactions will be left to future work .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ derive ] we present coupled - cluster theory and its extension to three - body hamiltonians . in section  [ results ] , we solve the resulting coupled - cluster amplitude equations at the singles and doubles ( ccsd ) level for @xmath0he based on low - momentum nn and 3n interactions .",
    "our findings are especially promising as they show that the binding energy of @xmath0he can be calculated based on those parts of the 3nf that can be viewed as density - dependent zero- , one- , and two - body forces .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ summary ] .",
