    "in the last decades , our picture of post - agb stellar evolution has been greatly improved .",
    "the `` standard '' evolution , i.e. the hydrogen - rich sequence , has been understood in the early eighties of the last century by comparison of spectral analysis and evolutionary models .",
    "the spectral analysis of the hottest post - agb stars with effective temperatures ( @xmath0 ) was hampered by the lack of appropriate model atmospheres which considered deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) playing an important role in the photospheres of these stars .",
    "the development of such non - lte model atmospheres is briefly summarized in sect .",
    "[ sect : models ] .",
    "spectral analyses of hot post - agb stars have shown then that about a quarter of these are hydrogen - deficient @xcite .",
    "the `` born - again post - agb star '' scenario by @xcite is  in general  able to explain the evolution of these stars .",
    "a final thermal pulse ( tp , re - ignition of the helium shell ) brings the star back to the agb and it has a second , helium - burning post - agb phase . however , the mechanism to dispose of the entire hydrogen - rich envelope was unclear .",
    "present evolutionary calculations which consider the mixing and burning processes during the helium - shell flash in detail , are able to explain the hydrogen deficiency .",
    "the amount of remaining hydrogen is depending on the particular time when the tp occurs . still on the agb ( agb final thermal pulse , aftp ) , the masses of the hydrogen - rich envelope and the helium - rich intershell layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) are about equal , being roughly @xmath1 .",
    "the tp mixing results in @xmath2 hydrogen content ( by mass ) at the stellar surface .",
    "this is detectable in the observations .",
    "after the departure from the agb , the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope is much lower ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "if the tp occurs at still constant ( high ) luminosity ( late thermal pulse , ltp ) , i.e. nuclear burning is still `` on '' , the mixing during the flash reduces the surface hydrogen to @xmath4 which is not detectable at the high surface gravity ( @xmath5 in cm / sec@xmath6 )",
    ". a tp at already declining luminosity , i.e. there is no entropy barrier due to the hydrogen - burning shell , will mix down the hydrogen - rich envelope to the bottom of the now re - ignited helium shell where hydrogen is burned and the star becomes hydrogen free .        the mixing process during the tp brings intershell matter up to the stellar surface and , thus , allows a direct view on it .",
    "spectral analysis allows then to conclude on details of both , mixing as well as nuclear processes like , e.g. the s - process , in agb stars .",
    "this is a crucial test for stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the spectral analysis of hot stars requires suitable non - lte model atmospheres .",
    "such models are available since @xcite presented the first calculation based on the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) techniques . for more details",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "presently , our tbingen nlte model atmosphere package ( _ tmap _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is capable to calculate plane - parallel and spherical , chemically homogeneous , non - lte model atmospheres in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium and considers opacities of all species from hydrogen to nickel @xcite .    in the last two decades ,",
    "_ tmap _ has been successfully employed for the analysis of hot post - agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "space - based observatories like , e.g. , fuse and hst , have provided high - resolution , high - s / n uv spectra which have shown that we arrived at a severe limitation due to the lack of reliable atomic and line - broadening data for highly ionized species .",
    "this is a challenge for atomic physics .",
    "in this section , we will highlight some recent important results of our analyses . for a more detailed review on the spectroscopy of hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars see @xcite .",
    "* fluorine * ( fvi @xmath7 ) has been identified for the first time in fuse observations of post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "f is produced during helium burning on the agb via @xmath8 .",
    "our spectral analysis has shown that the f abundance in hydrogen - deficient pg1159-type stars is about @xmath9 solar ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this result confirms the f intershell abundances predicted by evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "* neon * ( nevii @xmath10 ) was first identified by @xcite in optical observations of pg1159 stars .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this line was detected in a high - temperature discharge plasma as a weak blend on a strong neii line already many years ago @xcite und is frequently used as a calibration line in the laboratory @xcite  unfortunately this was not known in astronomy before and demonstrates the need for improvement and extension of atomic - data databases .",
    "ne is synthesized in the helium - burning shell by the @xmath11 chain .",
    "the determined photospheric abundance is 2% by mass ( @xmath12 solar , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , well in agreement with early evolutionary models of @xcite .    in fuse observations of pg1159 stars , we could firstly identify nevii @xmath13 @xcite  a stellar wind can form a strong nevii pcygni profile @xcite  the closely located ciii @xmath14 line is much too weak at the relevant temperature regime ( fig.[fig : wind ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite presented reliable atomic data of neviii .",
    "this enables us to calculate the neviii spectrum of hot post - agb stars and we could identify neviii absorption lines in fuse observations @xcite .",
    "the identification of nevii and neviii lines provides a new sensitive tool for very hot stars to determine @xmath15 by an evaluation of the nevii / viii ionization equilibrium .",
    "it is worthwhile to note , that @xmath15 of the hottest known helium - rich do white dwarf , kpd0005 + 5106 , had to be revised to @xmath16 ( previously @xmath17 ) by the identification and modelling of neviii emission lines in its spectrum .",
    "these lines were previously thought to be oviii lines which however could not be of photospheric origin @xcite .",
    "* argon * also provides an ionization equilibrium ( arvi / vii ) for the determination of @xmath15 in very hot stars . @xcite",
    "identified arvii @xmath18 in fuse observations of hot central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspne ) and in white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite identified arvi lines in a hst / stis observations of the cspn lsv46@xmath1921 .",
    "* iron * is not affected by nuclear burning but its abundance may be reduced due to n - captures in the s - process .",
    "evolutionary calculations predict only a very weak extent of its depletion .",
    "in contrast , spectral analyses of fuse observations with sufficiently high s / n of four hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars have shown that no iron lines are detectable .",
    "thus , a very strong fe depletion ( at least @xmath20 ) takes place in the intershell @xcite .     with the fuse observation of the cspn ngc7094 .",
    "note that ciii @xmath14 is much too weak at @xmath21 to explain the observed ( nevii ) profile .",
    "the vertical bars at the bottom mark the positions of h@xmath22 lines in the interstellar spectrum . ]",
    "the cspn ngc7094 is a so - called hybrid pg1159 star , i.e. it exhibits hydrogen lines in its spectrum . in a non - lte spectral analysis @xcite",
    "determined @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and h : he : c : n : o = 0.42:0.51:0.05:(@xmath240.01):(@xmath240.01 ) in mass fractions .",
    "the cspn ngc7094 may thus be an aftp star .",
    "@xcite discovered a strong iron deficiency of about two dex . in an on - going analysis of fuse and hst / stis observations",
    "( ziegler et al . in prep . ) , we aim to identify nickel lines in order to determine the fe / ni abundance ratio which is a indicator for the efficiency of the s - process .",
    "we did not succeed in this attempt .",
    "it is possible that the s - process has transferred iron into nickel and then into more heavy species .",
    "unfortunately , we can not search for lines of trans iron - group elements because no atomic data are available .",
    "we used the newly developed _",
    "hotblast _ non - lte code for spherically expanding atmospheres in order to calculate the pcygni profile of nevii @xmath13 .",
    "_ hotblast _ uses as an input the atmospheric structure of our static _ tmap _ model to simulate the atmosphere below the `` wind region '' . in the course of our analysis",
    ", it turned out that the fuse observation is strongly contaminated by interstellar line absorption ( fig.[fig : wind ] ) . therefore , we employed the programme _ owens _ ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which can simulate interstellar clouds with individual parameters like , e.g. , radial velocity , column density in the line of sight , temperature of the gas , and microturbulence velocity .",
    "although we show in fig.[fig : wind ] only a qualitative fit of the ism line absorption , it is obvious that simultaneous modeling of both , the stellar and interstellar line spectrum , is necessary in order to search and identify weak metal lines .",
    "spectral analysis by means of non - lte model - atmosphere techniques has for a long time been regarded as a domain of specialists . within the _ german astrophysical virtual observatory _",
    "( _ _ gavo _ _ ) project , we have created the vo service _ _ theossa__. a vo user may use pre - calculated grids of spectral energy distributions ( seds , in a pilot phase calculated by _",

    "this is the easiest way to use synthetic seds calculated from non - lte model atmospheres .",
    "they represent stars much better than still oftenly used blackbody flux distributions for pne analyses .",
    "if individual parameters are requested which do not fit to an already existing sed in the database , the vo user is guided to _ _ tmaw__. with this www interface , the vo user may calculate an individual model atmosphere , requesting @xmath15 , @xmath26 , and mass fractions @xmath27 , @xmath28 $ ] ( more species will be included in the future ) . for this calculation ,",
    "standard model atoms are used which are provided within the tbingen model - atom database ( _ _ tmad _ _ ) . since the vo user can do this without detailed knowledge of the programme code working in the background , the access to individually calculated seds is as simple as the use of pre - calculated seds ",
    "however , the calculation needs some time ( depending on the number of species considered , the wall - clock time is ranging from hours to a few days ) .",
    "standard seds of all calculated model atmospheres are automatically ingested into the _ gavo _ data base and , thus , it is growing in time .    in case that a detailed spectral analysis is performed , an experienced vo user may create an own atomic data file tailored for a specific purpose considering all necessary species ( @xmath29 $ ] ) and calculate own model atmospheres and seds .    in close collaboration of _ gavo _ with the _",
    "german astronomy community grid _",
    "( _ _ astrogrid - d _",

    "this will allow to calculate small grids of model atmospheres and seds on a reasonable timescale .",
