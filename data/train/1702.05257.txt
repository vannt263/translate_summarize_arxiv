    "@xmath35-distance - balanced graphs which are not 2-connected were characterized , and @xmath35-distance - balanced graphs were studied with respect to various graph products .",

    "distance - balanced graphs have been extensively studied , see @xcite .",
    "we also point out that every distance - regular graph  @xcite is highly distance - balanced .",
    "the opposite is of course not true .",
    "for instance , the generalized petersen graph @xmath36 ( see the definition at the end of this section ) is highly distance - balanced ( see table  [ tab : gp ] ) but it can be easily seen that it is not distance - regular .",

    "we first study basic properties of @xmath0-distance - balanced graphs .",

    "in this section we present some basic properties of @xmath0-distance - balanced graphs and give various examples of such graphs .",
    "we first state a fairly straightforward but useful observation and its corollary .    [",

    "if some @xmath58 interchanges @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then the pair @xmath2 is balanced .",
    "this follows from the fact that for any automorphism @xmath58 we have @xmath59 , and so in the case that @xmath60 interchanges @xmath4 and @xmath5 we obtain @xmath61 . as @xmath60 is a bijection we thus get @xmath30 .",
    "[ cor : swap ] let @xmath1 be a connected graph such that for each pair of vertices @xmath31 there exists an automorphism of @xmath1 interchanging @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "[ remark1 ] a similar result as in corollary  [ cor : swap ] is given in  ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is then stated ( in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.12 ) ) that this forces every graph @xmath1 , in which for every pair of vertices at distance @xmath0 there is an automorphism of @xmath1 mapping one to the other , to be @xmath0-distance - balanced .",
    "this however does not hold , since it would imply that every vertex - transitive graph is highly distance - balanced .",
    "but , for example , the generalized petersen graph @xmath62 with diameter @xmath63 is vertex - transitive ( as @xmath64 is congruent to @xmath65 modulo @xmath66 ) , but it is not @xmath67-distance - balanced ( see table  [ tab : gp ] ) .",
    "corollary [ cor : swap ] for instance implies that the petersen graph @xmath68 is highly distance - balanced since it is distance - transitive .",
    "moreover , the corollary gives rise to infinitely many highly distance - balanced graphs .",
    "in particular , every cayley graph of an abelian group is highly distance - balanced .",
    "[ pro : abelian ] let @xmath69 be a finite abelian group and let @xmath70 be an inverse closed subset of @xmath69 not containing the identity @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath71 then the cayley graph @xmath72 is highly distance - balanced .    proof .",
    "since the graph @xmath73 is vertex transitive it suffices to prove that there exists no @xmath74 such that the pair @xmath65 , @xmath75 is non - balanced . observe that , since @xmath69 is abelian , the permutation @xmath76 of @xmath69 , mapping each element to its inverse , is an automorphism of @xmath16 .",

    "the above proposition implies that cycles , being cayley graphs of cyclic groups , are highly distance - balanced .",
    "one of the next natural families of graphs that could possibly provide interesting examples and nonexamples of @xmath0-distance - balanced graphs is the family of cubic graphs . within this family the well known family of generalized petersen graphs",
    "might be a good place to start the investigation . as we will see in section  [ sec : gp ] the problem of determining all @xmath0 such that , for given @xmath84 and @xmath45 , the generalized petersen graph @xmath85 is @xmath0-distance - balanced , does not seem to be easy .",
    "of course , for some pairs of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the problem is very easy .",

    "[ cor : prism ] let @xmath84 be an integer .",

    "the cayley graph @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( the truncation of the tetrahedron ) , which is a cubic graph of diameter @xmath6 , is @xmath65-distance - balanced and @xmath6-distance - balanced , but it is not @xmath35-distance - balanced .",
    "namely , the pair @xmath91 and @xmath92 is not balanced as we get @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see figure  [ fig : examples ] ) . similarly , the cayley graph @xmath95 , which is a cubic graph of diameter @xmath67 , is @xmath65-distance - balanced and @xmath35-distance - balanced but is not @xmath6-distance - balanced ( see figure  [ fig : examples ] ) nor @xmath67-distance - balanced since none of the pairs @xmath96 , @xmath97 , nor @xmath96 , @xmath98 is balanced .",
    "it thus seems that already with cubic graphs the situation regarding @xmath0-distance - balancedness is quite interesting .",
    "is not @xmath35-distance - balanced and the cayley graph @xmath95 is not @xmath6-distance - balanced . ]",
    "another interesting family of graphs are distance degree regular graphs ( first introduced in  @xcite and later called strongly distance - balanced graphs in  @xcite ) . a connected graph @xmath1 with diameter @xmath34 is called _ distance degree regular _",
    ", whenever @xmath99 for any two vertices @xmath2 of @xmath1 and for any @xmath100 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that every distance degree regular graph is automatically distance - balanced .",
    "as we now show , it is also @xmath35-distance - balanced provided it is bipartite .    [ ddr_thm1 ] let @xmath1 denote a bipartite distance degree regular graph .",
    "then @xmath1 is @xmath65- and @xmath35-distance - balanced .    proof . by the above remark we only need to show that @xmath16 is @xmath35-distance - balanced .",

    "we show that then @xmath30 .",
    "observe first that since @xmath1 is bipartite we have @xmath102 to prove the theorem it thus suffices to verify that for each @xmath103 the equality @xmath104 holds .",
    "we show this using induction on @xmath19 . obviously , @xmath105 . since @xmath106 and @xmath16 is bipartite we have that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "thus , since @xmath109 we get @xmath110 .",
    "suppose now that for some @xmath111 we have that @xmath112 for each @xmath113 .",
    "observe that @xmath114 is a disjoint union of @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "similarly , @xmath118 is a disjoint union of @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . since @xmath122",
    "we thus get @xmath123 since , by induction hypothesis , @xmath124 holds , we thus obtain @xmath125 , which completes the induction step .",
    "[ ddr_cor2 ] let @xmath1 denote a connected bipartite vertex transitive graph .",
    "then @xmath1 is @xmath35-distance - balanced . in particular , every bipartite connected cayley graph is @xmath35-distance - balanced .    proof .",
    "observe that every vertex transitive graph is clearly distance degree regular .",
    "the result now follows immediately from theorem [ ddr_thm1 ] .",
    "we remark that the result of theorem  [ ddr_thm1 ] ( as well as corollary  [ ddr_cor2 ] ) can not be extended to nonbipartite distance degree regular graphs .",
    "namely , the truncation of the tetrahedron is vertex - transitive ( being a cayley graph ) and as such is distance degree regular but is not @xmath35-distance - balanced as was indicated on figure  [ fig : examples ] .",
    "in this section we study graphs with diameter @xmath35 or @xmath6 ( the graphs of diameter @xmath65 , i. e. the complete graphs , are of course @xmath65-distance - balanced ) .",

    "* corollary 2.3 ) , @xmath1 is @xmath65-distance - balanced if and only if it is regular .",
    "it thus remains to determine when @xmath1 is @xmath35-distance - balanced .",
    "to do so we first need some more terminology .",
