    "much of physics boils down to solving differential equations subject to certain boundary conditions .",
    "waves in a box are a classic example .",
    "the box we have in mind here is some closed manifold , and the waves are those of a massless scalar field .",
    "this picture arises naturally when studying density perturbations in a multi - connected universe@xcite .",
    "the mathematical problem can be stated : find all square integrable functions @xmath0 that satisfy the partial differential equation @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the laplace operator on some closed manifold @xmath3 and the constant @xmath4 is an eigenvalue of the laplacian .",
    "the complexity of the problem is controlled by the geometry of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 is @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space , @xmath6 , modulo some discrete group of covering transformations , @xmath7 , it is a simple matter to write down analytic expressions for the eigenmodes @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath3 describes some compact hyperbolic manifold , @xmath8 , then the eigenmodes can not be expressed in closed analytic form .",
    "this difficulty is closely related to the chaotic behaviour of geodesic flows on compact negatively curved spaces@xcite . here",
    "we describe a numerical solution to the problem based on fourier filtering solutions to the scalar wave equation @xmath9 .",
    "while our approach works for any topology , we will focus on hyperbolic manifolds as these are of the most interest to cosmology .",
    "rather than attack laplace s equation directly , we begin by introducing a ficticious time dimension @xmath10 , thereby lifting the problem to solving the wave equation @xmath11 on the lorentzian manifold @xmath12 .",
    "consistent with this picture we adopt a product ansatz for the eigenmodes : @xmath13 the eigenfrequency @xmath14 is fixed by ( [ wave ] ) to equal @xmath4 .",
    "assuming for now that the spatial boundary conditions have been properly enforced , we can evolve the initial data @xmath15 , @xmath16 according to ( [ wave ] ) to find @xmath17 . by fourier transforming in time : @xmath18 and calculating the power spectrum @xmath19 we are able to isolate the eigenfrequencies @xmath14 .",
    "these are located at local maxima of @xmath20 .",
    "once the eigenfrequencies are known the individual spatial eigenmodes can be extracted : @xmath21 in practice the integration time @xmath22 will be finite , so we can only resolve modes separated in frequency by at least @xmath23 .    the main difficulty in implementing the above procedure stems from the complicated periodic boundary conditions that are imposed by the topology .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to describing a numerical solution to this problem , and illustrating how it works by finding the eigenmodes for a genus 2 surface with constant negative curvature .",
    "the manifold we will focus on is the two - hole doughnut @xmath24 , where @xmath7 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath25 with presentation @xmath26 the group generators have the @xmath25 matrix representation@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 the double doughnut can be obtained by gluing together opposite faces of a regular octagon with dihedral angles @xmath30 .",
    "the octagonal fundamental domain ( fd ) is drawn in fig .  1 using the poincar disc model for @xmath31 .    ( 0,0 ) ( 193,35)@xmath32 ( 90,135)@xmath33    the double doughnut has area @xmath34 and diameter @xmath35 .",
    "all distances are quoted in units of the curvature radius .",
    "the largest simply connected circle that can be drawn inside @xmath3 has radius @xmath36 , and the smallest circle to fully enclose the fundamental domain has radius @xmath37 .",
    "the light crossing time varies in the interval @xmath38 , and has the mean value @xmath39 .",
    "this is the lyapunov time for chaotic flows on @xmath3 , and represents the characteristic dynamical timescale for our system .",
    "the dynamics is described by a massless scalar field @xmath40 with action @xmath41 evolving on the lorentzian manifold @xmath42 . choosing a poincar metric for @xmath31 we have @xmath43 the coordinate distance @xmath44",
    "is related to the proper distance @xmath45 by @xmath46 . to evolve the system numerically",
    "we begin by discretising time and space such that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "we begin by sorting all points in the spatial grid into those inside and outside the fundamental domain .",
    "there is a simple sorting algorithm that works for all topologies . in what follows",
    ", @xmath55 denotes the proper distance from the origin .    1 .",
    "if @xmath56 then the point lies inside the fd . if @xmath57 then the point lies outside the fd",
    "2 .   for @xmath58 ,",
    "act on @xmath59 by all @xmath5 group generators and their inverses to form the @xmath60 image points @xmath61 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath62 for any @xmath63 , then @xmath59 lies outside the fundamental domain , else @xmath59 is inside the fundamental domain .",
    "only the `` master '' points inside the fd need to be evolved .",
    "however , forming the second derivatives @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the masters often requires knowledge of field values outside the fd .",
    "we refer to all points outside the fd that are within one grid point of a master as `` slaves '' .",
    "points that are neither masters nor slaves play no part in the numerical evolution and are designated `` freemen '' .",
    "each slave has a unique image inside the fd .",
    "we can find the position of these images using the following algorithm .    1 .",
    "act on @xmath59 by all @xmath5 group generators and their inverses to form the @xmath60 image points @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   find the image point @xmath66 nearest the origin and call it @xmath67 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath68 then let @xmath69 and go to ( i ) , else @xmath59 is the fundamental image .",
    "since typical coordinate grids are not mapped into themselves by the fundamental group , the slave image points will not lie on the computational mesh .",
    "therefore we have to interpolate to find the field value at each slave point .",
    "the procedure of point sorting and image finding is illustrated in fig .",
    "only one quadrant of the fd is shown since the fd has 8-fold symmetry .",
    "the slave images are those of slave points located in the other three quadrants .",
    "[ orbs ]    the interpolation of the slave values is done using either a 3-point , 4-point or 6-point interpolation scheme .",
    "employing the labelling convention shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "the 6-point interpolation is described by @xmath70 here @xmath71 . by rotating the coordinates so that the interpolation is performed in the quadrant @xmath72",
    ", we can ensure that the @xmath73 vertex of the cell enclosing the image point lies nearest the origin .",
    "this increases the chances that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are master points .",
    "nevertheless , we need to check that all points involved in the interpolation are either masters or slaves .",
    "if a freeman is used in the interpolation it must be enslaved .",
    "once this is done for all the slave points we arrive at a set of @xmath76 coupled linear equations involving @xmath76 slaves and @xmath77 masters ( the slave drivers ) .",
    "writing the list of slaves and slave drivers as the column vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the interpolation equation ( [ interp ] ) can be used to form the linear system @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a @xmath82 matrix and @xmath83 is a @xmath84 matrix .",
    "this procedure only has to be performed once at the beginning of a simulation .",
    "the @xmath84 matrix @xmath85 can then be stored and called during the numerical evolution . in summary , at each time step the masters are evolved according to ( [ eveq ] ) .",
    "the slaves are then updated using ( [ slv ] ) .",
    "the slaves are the glue that holds together identified sides of the fundamental cell .",
    "if the glue is poor energy can either leak in or out of the system .",
    "thus , by keeping track of the total energy @xmath86 we can check that the periodic boundary conditions are being properly implemented .",
    "the kinetic energy is given by @xmath87\\delta x \\delta y \\ , .\\ ] ] and the gradient energy is given by @xmath88\\delta x\\delta y   , \\ ] ]",
    "several simulations were run using @xmath89 grids covering the region @xmath90 .",
    "the coordinate grid spacings were : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the proper distance between grid points varies between @xmath93 near the origin and @xmath94 at the extremities of the fd .",
    "consequently , the resolution is @xmath95 times worse at the edge of the fd .",
    "other metrics could be used to give a more even coverage if desired . as a check on the accuracy of the code",
    "the area was evaluated and compare to the continuum answer : @xmath96    two types of initial conditions were used for @xmath97 .",
    "the first employed a random superposition of gaussian peaks and was designed to excite as many eigenmodes as possible .",
    "the second employed a superposition of two spherically symmetric eigenmodes ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) of the laplacian on @xmath31 .",
    "this choice was designed to excite low lying eigenmodes .",
    "the waveforms were smoothed to remove any large gradients caused by the imposition of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the residual monopole contribution was removed to increase our chances of resolving any low lying multipoles .",
    "a stroboscopic sequence showing the evolution of the random gaussian peaks is shown in fig .",
    "the wave was evolved for @xmath100 timesteps , which equates to @xmath101 curvature units , or roughly 20 light crossing times .",
    "the total energy remained roughly constant throughout the simulation , although there were @xmath102 fluctuations about the mean value .",
    "we believe these variations are due to the uneven grid resolution .",
    "the wave was fourier analysed to produce the scaled power spectrum shown in fig .  5 .",
    "the power spectrum is multiplied by @xmath103 for @xmath104 to reflect the larger statistical weight of the high frequency modes .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 190,38)@xmath4    the first three peaks are at @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the errors reflect the finite frequency resolution of @xmath108 . aside from some residual monopole power at @xmath109",
    "there is no evidence for any low lying eigenmodes .",
    "we will return to this crucially important point later .    by fourier filtering at @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "we are able to extract the corresponding spatial eigenmodes .",
    "these are displayed in fig .",
    "6 . by numerically evaluating the laplacian of these waveforms we were able to confirm that they are indeed eigenmodes with the correct eigenvalues .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .  7 by displaying the eigenmode @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the agreement is remarkably good over most of the fd , save for some small regions where the spatial gradients are large .",
    "the eigenmodes can be improved by a second scrubbing run .",
    "to do this we use the approximate eigenmode as initial data and evolve the system as before while filtering at the appropriate eigenfrequency .",
    "this helps to remove contamination from the other eigenmodes .    one possible explanation for the lack of eigenmodes below @xmath114 might be a lack of long range power in our choice of initial conditions .",
    "to check this we tried a different initial waveform based on a superposition of the spherically symmetric @xmath98 and @xmath99 eigenmodes of @xmath31 . when the periodic boundary conditions are imposed the resulting initial waveform has 8-fold symmetry .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 270,53)@xmath4    the scaled power spectrum shown in fig .",
    "8 shows no sign of any modes below @xmath114 .",
    "as expected , many of the modes excited by the random superposition of gaussian peaks are missing from the spectrum produced by the 8-fold symmetric initial conditions .",
    "however , the modes that are present agree with those in seen in fig",
    "in @xmath5 dimensions the eigenmode spectrum for @xmath115 takes all values in the range @xmath116 , where @xmath117 . modes with @xmath118 are not square integrable in infinite @xmath5-dimensional hyperbolic space , but they are square integrable in the compact quotients @xmath119 . according to buser@xcite , many compact hyperbolic manifolds support supercurvature modes with @xmath118 .",
    "the name supercurvature refers to the fact that these modes support significant long range correlations on scales larger than the curvature scale .",
    "in contrast , modes with @xmath120 have exponentially damped correlations outside the curvature radius , even though their wavelengths @xmath121 may greatly exceed the curvature scale .",
    "this suppression can be understood on the grounds of flux conservation in a space where the volume grows exponentially on large scales .",
    "supercurvature modes are very important in a cosmological setting as even a single supercurvature mode can significantly increase the amplitude of cosmic microwave background fluctuations on large angular scales@xcite .",
    "there are a number of upper and lower bounds for the lowest eigenvalue , @xmath122 , of the laplacian on @xmath123 . in two dimensions the tightest upper",
    "bound we know of was found by cheng@xcite : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the diameter of @xmath3 . applying this to our genus 2 example",
    "we find that @xmath126 , which is consistent with what we found ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "using cheeger s inequality , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is cheeger s isoperimetric constant , balazs & voros@xcite suggest that @xmath130 .",
    "this is also consistent with our result .    to be certain that we have not missed any low lying eigenvalues we need to use other methods such as the selberg - gutzwiller global eigenvalue count@xcite . after presenting our results in cleveland",
    ", we discovered a paper by aurich & steiner@xcite that calculates all the low lying eigenvalues for the double doughnut using a suitably regularised gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "they find the lowest three eigenvalues to be @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , in perfect agreement with our values .",
    "this proves that we did not miss any low lying eigenvalues .",
    "while their values are sharper , the advantage of our method is that it allows us to extract the eigenmodes in addition to the eigenvalues .    the lack of low lying eigenmodes on the regular octagon is probably related to its high degree of symmetry",
    "indeed , it is possible to move to an alternative description of the manifold using a larger fundamental group and a fundamental cell @xmath134 times smaller than the octagon@xcite . viewed from this perspective , the lowest eigenmode is remarkably low , as it corresponds to a wave with a wavelength @xmath135 times larger than the diameter of the desymmetrised fundamental cell .",
    "having demonstrated that our approach works in 2-dimensions , our next task is to apply it to the cosmologically relevant case where @xmath3 is a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold .",
    "the computational cost of having an extra dimension will be offset by the availability of examples with very small fundamental domains .",
    "many small hyperbolic 3-manifolds have fd s that have outradii , @xmath136 , smaller than the radius of curvature@xcite .",
    "consequently , space looks approximately euclidean inside the fd , so standard coordinate systems such as the klein metric will produce fairly uniform computational grids .",
    "once we have found all the low lying eigenmodes we can use them to produce simulated maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "these maps can then be compared to observational data , or used to test proposals for finding the large scale topology of the universe@xcite .",
