    "* gaas membrane fabrication . *",
    "the gaas membrane is fabricated from a gaas / algaas heterostructure wafer comprised of a ( 100)-oriented gaas substrate ( 350  @xmath0 m ) , an al@xmath49ga@xmath50as etch stop layer ( 1  @xmath0 m ) , and a gaas capping layer ( 160  nm ) as shown in fig .",
    "the backside of the wafer is patterned by photolithography and a selective wet etching process using a citric - acid - based solution is employed to remove the gaas substrate in the area selected by the photolithographic pattern .",
    "finally , another selective wet etching process using hydrofluoric acid is used to remove the sacrificial layer , thus resulting in a 160-nm - thick suspended gaas membrane as shown in figs .",

    "the cavity length ( @xmath52  29  mm ) can be stabilized to a variable position on the cavity resonant slope .",
    "the rf signal from the two - segment photodiode and a reference signal at frequency @xmath51 from the signal generator are fed into a 2-phase lock - in amplifier as shown in fig .",
    "the produced mixed - down signals @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspond to the @xmath55 and @xmath56 components of the membrane displacement within the bandwidth of @xmath57  500  hz centred around @xmath51 , and their squared sum corresponds to @xmath58 . for the ringdown measurements",
    "a digital oscilloscope is used to track the signal @xmath58 triggered by a ttl signal , by which the modulation of the cavity field is also turned off .",
    "the ringdown time of the mechanical oscillations is measured starting from the moment when the modulation is turned off while keeping the offset power level of the cavity input for cooling",

    "* in the cold damping scenario  @xcite the equation of motion for the membrane displacement in the fourier space is modified into @xmath59 due to the photo - induced force @xmath22 , where @xmath60 is the thermal langevin force and @xmath61 is the motional mass of the membrane  @xcite . here",
    "the modified resonant frequency @xmath41 and the effective damping rate @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is the spatial derivative of @xmath22 introduced by the cavity and @xmath42 is the relevant time lag in the physical mechanism responsible for these modifications  @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature can then be defined as @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "* time - domain and frequency - domain measurements . * since the mechanical oscillations arise merely out of the thermal langevin force @xmath60 for the frequency - domain measurements the resultant signal - to - noise ratio is generally worse than the ringdown measurements , for which the intensity - modulated cavity field can be used to amplify the oscillations . note also that sub - hertz mechanical resonances are measured with a spectrum analyzer with the resolution bandwidth of 1  hz , which may contribute to the uncertainty of the determination of the area and certainly affects the width and height of the resonances . because of these deficiencies of the frequency - domain measurements , the majority of our measurements are done in the time - domain method , i.e. , the ringdown .    99 kippenberg ,  t.  j. & vahala ,  k.  j. cavity optomechanics : back - action at the mesoscale .",

    "<S> cooling down to the ground state via radiation pressure requires a high - finesse cavity and its experimental realization has been hindered by the difficulty to achieve good mechanical qualities and low - loss optical properties on a micro- or nanometer scale simultaneously . a way to mitigate this dilemma by separating optical and mechanical functionalities in the so - called membrane - in - the - middle approach </S>",
    "<S> has been demonstrated  @xcite .    applying the cavity cooling method to semiconductors </S>",
    "<S> offers interesting prospects . in optoelectronics semiconductor devices with engineered electronic and photonic band - structures have enabled , for example , strongly enhanced light - matter interactions for quantum photonics applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> semiconductors are also important in spintronics since they can be made ferromagnetic by doping with magnetic ions  @xcite and embrace localized long - lived electron and hole spins  @xcite . studying the interaction between the laser - cooled mechanical modes and these rich internal degrees of freedom of semiconductors may lead to a variety of new device conceptions in photonics and spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical proposal has been put forward to take advantage of the strong deformation potential coupling in semiconductors for cooling mechanical resonators with an embedded quantum dot instead of using a cavity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also the so - called optical refrigeration scheme  @xcite , which has been predicted to work efficiently for semiconductors and to reduce the entire lattice temperature down to 10  k , though no net cooling has yet been observed .    driven by these attractive features of semiconductors </S>",
    "<S> we have manufactured a @xmath1-nm - thick crystalline gallium arsenide ( gaas ) membrane ( see methods ) and investigated its potential for cavity optomechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we have found an extraordinarily large optomechanical coupling and photo - induced mechanical damping in a simple setting where a standard mirror and the membrane form a cavity with a finesse of only 10 . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide evidence of the first experimental realization of cavity cooling of mechanical modes using internal electronic degrees of freedom of semiconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup and the structure of the fabricated gaas membrane are summarized in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> a 1-mw diode laser ( 975  nm ) is used to probe the membrane oscillations via a beam deflection method with a two - segment photodiode . by feeding the rf signal from the photodiode to a spectrum analyzer </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical resonant frequencies can be identified . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the fundamental mechanical mode ( the ( 1,1)-mode ) is 23.4  khz ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a ti : sapphire laser providing the opto - mechanical coupling is mode - matched to the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the ringdown of the mechanical modes is observed by inducing the oscillations with an intensity - modulated cavity field ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2b shows the results of the mechanical ringdown indicating that the damping rate is strongly enhanced by the cavity field at the wavelength of 810  nm and is linearly proportional to the cavity input power offset as is expected from the damping model ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is the frequency shift as a result of the cavity field .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the damping of the mechanical oscillations can only be observed when the cavity resonant frequency @xmath2 is detuned to the red from the laser frequency @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 , as opposed to the case of the cavity cooling via the radiation pressure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optomechanical instabilities ( mechanical parametric oscillations )  @xcite set in when @xmath5 ( even for the cavity input power as low as 5  @xmath0w ) or when the cavity input power exceeds 50  @xmath0w ( regardless of the cavity detuning ) preventing us from using these conditions for the ringdown measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the instabilities with such a small photon number imply a substantial optomechanical coupling .    to assess the mechanical properties of the membrane the intrinsic mechanical damping rate @xmath6 and the quality factor @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> are inferred by extrapolating the ringdown data down to zero cavity field ( where @xmath8 is the extrapolated bare resonant frequency ) . a markedly high quality factor @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> is found for the ( 3,1)-mode at the frequency of 59.5  khz ( fig .  2c and 2d ) . </S>",

    "<S> have been only observed to - date at a cryogenic temperature  @xcite ; although two orders of magnitude higher value at room temperature has been reported for stressed sin nanomembranes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation strongly encourages ongoing efforts to use crystalline semiconductors for nano- and micro - electromechanics ( nems and mems )  @xcite and optomechanics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the damping is not accompanied by any extra fluctuations , i.e. , is the cold damping  @xcite , the enhanced damping also implies cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature can then be defined as @xmath12 ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the damping rate at 50  @xmath0w ( just below the instability - onset power ) to the extrapolated intrinsic one thus gives the maximum cooling factor @xmath13 in our setting . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c the cooling factor for the ( 1,1)-mode is found to be about 11 . </S>",
    "<S> for the ( 3,1)-mode , holding the highest @xmath14 , the cooling factor is about 75 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2d , meaning that the effective temperature of the mode is reduced down to as low as 4  k from room temperature .    to prove that the observed damping really means cooling frequency - domain measurements have been also performed . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3a shows the power spectra of the mechanical resonances ( the ( 1,1)-mode ) for different cavity input powers . </S>",
    "<S> the slight discrepancy between the resonant frequencies of ringdown measurements in fig .  2c and those in the spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a is attributed to day - by - day temperature fluctuation ( about @xmath15  3@xmath16c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the area of the resonance , which is proportional to the effective temperature @xmath17  @xcite , clearly becomes smaller as the cavity input power increases . </S>",
    "<S> the original area with no cavity light divided by the reduced area gives the ratio @xmath18 , i.e. , the cooling factor . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b for different cavity inputs ( purple circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the resonance , on the other hand , reflects the damping rate since it is equal to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling factors obtained from the width measurements @xmath13 are shown in fig .  3b ( orange circles ) along with the corresponding cooling factors obtained from the ringdown measurements ( red diamonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> the three methods agree with each other within a factor of 3 ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the similar discrepancy between area and width measurements has been reported  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> further evidence of the cavity cooling is provided by the dependence of the cooling factor on the cavity detuning ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the cold damping scenario the effective damping rate @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 ( see methods ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the cavity resonance corresponds to @xmath21 since @xmath22 is presumably proportional to the intra - cavity photon number . the red solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c indicates the slope of the cavity resonance , i.e. , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> although the data from the ringdown measurements differ in detail from the expected behavior , it is evident that the enhancement of damping reflects @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the observed very efficient cooling to the effect of above - band - gap photons . </S>",
    "<S> photo - induced electrons in the conduction band ( holes in the valence band ) leads to an electronic stress in the lattice through the deformation potential coupling  @xcite , because the conduction band electrons bind the lattice weaker than the valence band electrons . </S>",
    "<S> growth of the cavity field due to the membrane motion leads to the photo - induced force on the membrane in the direction of motion , which is opposite to the case of radiation pressure . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the cavity detuning corresponding to cooling in the present case is opposite to that for radiation pressure cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic stress @xmath23 per single electron - hole pair generated by a photon with the energy @xmath24  1.53  ev ( 810  nm ) can be 100 times larger than the corresponding thermal stress @xmath25 , where the band gap of gaas at room temperature is @xmath26  =  1.43  ev ( 865  nm )  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath27 is the bulk modulus , @xmath28 is the hydrostatic deformation potential , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the thermal expansion coefficient and the heat capacity , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also the piezoelectric coupling in gaas , but compared to the deformation potential coupling its contribution to the cooling is negligible  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the presented optoelectronic cooling mechanism is supported by the observed dependence of the cooling factor on the photon energy ( wavelength ) of the cavity field in the range from @xmath24  1.53  ev ( 810  nm ) down to 1.40  ev ( 884  nm ) across the band gap @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the cooling factor is essentially constant from @xmath31 to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation rules out the possibility of the photo - thermal force being responsible for the cooling since it explicitly depends on @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the expected stress ratio @xmath34 is , as mentioned above , around 0.01 for @xmath24  1.53  ev ( 810  nm ) and it drops further as @xmath35 approaches @xmath26 also suggests that the contribution of @xmath36 to the cooling is marginal . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the cooling gradually reduces when @xmath37 and ceases to effect when @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath40  26  mev at room temperature ) , supporting the assertion that the carrier excitation is responsible for the cooling . </S>",
    "<S> last , but not least , we find a striking similarity between the trajectory of the cooling factor in fig .  4 and the photoconductivity response of a similar gaas membrane with an embedded field - effect transistor  @xcite . the slight decline of the cooling factor starting around 1.49  ev could be due to the interaction of the photo - excited carriers with the optical phonons as seen in the photoconductivity measurement  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed dependencies of @xmath41 and @xmath20 on optical power ( fig.2 ) can be used to infer @xmath42 , the delay time between the photo - induced force and displacement  @xcite , which is specific for every cooling mechanism  @xcite . using equations @xmath41 and @xmath20 given in the methods section we determine @xmath43 and @xmath44  10  ns . </S>",
    "<S> this fairly long delay time @xmath42 can be backed by the long ( @xmath45  ns ) radiative lifetime @xmath46 of free excitons in gaas  @xcite , though more studies are required to decisively determine the delay time @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding issue is the onset of the instability just above 50  @xmath0w which is unexpected from the simple model that we use . </S>",
    "<S> there are at least three distinctive time scales involved in the cooling mechanism ; the mechanical oscillation time @xmath47 , the cavity decay time @xmath48 , and the delay time @xmath42 introduced by the internal degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly calls for additional theoretical and experimental work to investigate these effects in the context of cavity optomechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> the demonstrated optomechanical coupling is very efficient . </S>",
    "<S> indeed significant changes in the membrane dynamics are observed already with a few microwatts of the input power corresponding to just 10,000 intracavity photons for our 3-cm cavity . for a 300-@xmath0 m cavity </S>",
    "<S> this number is down to 100 photons and even this number can be probably further reduced by a suitable design . using a higher finesse cavity with the membrane in the middle </S>",
    "<S> , the optical power can also be considerably reduced . </S>"
