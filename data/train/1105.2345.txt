    "during the last few years there has been many interesting phenomena observed in experiments at rhic .",
    "the vast majority of such phenomena has been studied and interpreted using well known models that incorporate energy loss dynamics .",
    "the broadening of the away - side peak appearing in azimuthal correlation studies in au+au collisions and absent in p+p collisions at the same energies , is one of these remarkable observations .",
    "this has yet to have a complete understanding that incorporates the medium characteristics and , at the same time , that is coherent with previous correlation studies .",
    "in fact , this particular double hump structure has been the subject of different theoretical analysis which are based on the assumption that unlike p+p collisions , a+a collisions are strongly influenced by collective phenomena .",
    "the purpose of this work is to put forward our particular approach to explore the origins of such structure in the away side .",
    "the details of this work have been provided in  @xcite and soon will be reported in greater extent elsewhere  @xcite .      in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "high @xmath0 partons are produced through hard processes in the initial binary nucleon collisions and they are the perfect tool to probe the dynamics of such ephimeral conditions .",
    "in fact , just by studying the way partons hadronize under such conditions , we can obtain information on the nature of the medium . just after the ion collision",
    ", many partons are produced due to the binary collisions between nucleons .",
    "these partons have to travel through the hot and dense medium , before they can hadronize .",
    "if these partons were to hadronize with little interaction , then the number of produced high @xmath0 hadrons detected , should scale with the number of binary collisions .",
    "it was quickly realised some time ago that the experimental evidence was telling a different story : the number of produced high @xmath0 hadrons is reduced significantly in these sort of collisions : up to 5 times in most central au + au collisions  @xcite .",
    "this strengthens the idea that the medium produced in such collisions is opaque for high @xmath0 partons . to study these ideas further ,",
    "more differential studies were devised by measuring azimuthal correlations between particle pairs at high @xmath0 . and , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ notthere ] , the near - side correlation is similar for the p + p and au + au collisions , while the away - side correlation is not there for central au + au events  @xcite .",

    "@xcite ]    many ideas were put forward to encompass a coherent explanation to what was being observed in these correlation studies . among others",
    ", there were many _",
    "elliptic flow studies _ implemented .",
    "these studies are based on the fact that an anisotropy in the momentum distribution of particles may arise after the initial binary collisions .",
    "they consider that the initial geometry of the collision region is anisotropic in the azimuthal direction so that after the interacting system reaches local thermal equilibrium , preassure gradients are steeper in the impact parameter direction and these generate the elliptic flow .",
    "so up until then , the elliptic flow together with the two particle correlation studies applied on different analisis , gave an indication that an opaque , strongly interacting partonic matter had been created in the high energy au + au collisions at rhic .      in 2005",
    "there was a rich correlation structure in au + au vs p + p reported by the leading collaborations at rhic .",
    "they observed a _ ridge _ and _ broad away side _ in the correlation studies performed at the time .",
    "more precisely , they reported an excess yield of correlated particles at @xmath1 and @xmath2 extending out to @xmath3  @xcite     bins . reprinted figure with permission from phenix collaboration ( a. adare et al . ) , phys .",

    "[ headshoulder ] we can see that , to analize the origins of such structure the phenix collaboration identified _ head _ and _ shoulders _ regions and defined a ratio @xmath4 ( _ head / shoulder _ ) . looking closely at the ratio @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ ratiorhs ] , we can see that for p+p collisions @xmath4 grows with @xmath0 , which can be interpreted as a production of a narrower jet , whereas for au + au , jet fragmentation dominates at high @xmath0 over medium effects .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to look for the origins of such structures , among others the literature focuses mainly on    * mach or cerenkov cone due to medium reaction  @xcite : the _",
    "double hump _ can be explained by considering how the medium reacts to the passing of a fast parton . in principle",
    "this would produce such structures since the medium would eject two bunches of hadrons in the away side . *",
    "triangularity and triangular flow  @xcite : the _",
    "double hump _ can be explained by considering event - by - event fluctuations in the initial collision geometry as a next order collective flow effect , after considering the elliptic flow effects .",
    "we can see that all of the theoretical models rely on the description of such away - side structures as the manifestation of emergent behaviour due to the collective ( e.g. triangular flow : relies crucially on the existence of initial geometry fluctuations ) .",
    "in fact , there are a couple of recent reviews on the models posed to solve this puzzle : up until 2009 , j. l. nagle  @xcite argued that `` ... none of the theoretical models are succesful to describe all the special characteristics of these structures ... '' and this year , m. j. tannenbaum  @xcite argued that `` ... no clear paradigm has emerged for the two - lobed wide away - jet structure ... ''",
    "in a nutshell , our proposal  @xcite regarding the origins of the double - hump in the away side of two - particle correlation studies in a + a collisions , is as follows    * we account for the medium induced energy loss effects on the calculation of @xmath5 cross sections * we also take into account the different path lengths for the trajectories of 3 as opposed to 2 particles in the final state of an a + a collision * finally , considering that one particle is absorbed by the medium and the other one punches through * this gives on average , a double hump structure    in other words , when we have a @xmath6 scattering process , we have a correlation between the leading and the away side that looks , schematically as shown in fig .",
    "[ dist1 ] .",
    "there , one expects the defined humps to be around @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "but when one considers the possibility of a significant contribution to this correlation studies , coming from a promotion of the @xmath9 scattering processes , on average one has a double hump structure ( roughly at around @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dist2 ] , again schematically .",
    "[ dist1 ]   process.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ dist2 ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in our calculation , we use the cteq6 parametrization for the parton distribution functions  @xcite and the kkp parametrization  @xcite for the ( unmodified ) parton fragmentation funtions together with lo - diphox  @xcite to compare with the @xmath6 result . in the case of p +",
    "p collisions the @xmath12 final state particle differential cross section at @xmath13 gev is shown in fig .",
    "[ ppxsec ] for the away side hadrons as a function of the azimuthal angle .",
    "we focus on midrapidity region ( @xmath14 ) and as an example that simplifies the calculation , consider a situation in which all hadrons carry @xmath15 gev / c .",
    "we can see that we have two well defined peaks at @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , for a @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) particle final state .",
    "[ ppxsec ]   final state particle differential cross section at @xmath13 gev for p + p collisions  @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to describe the same observables but for a au + au collision , we now use modified parton fragmentation functions proposed by zhang et al  @xcite , to account for the effects of the medium on the propagation of the produced partons .",
    "these fragmentation functions are parametrized as follows : @xmath20     + e^{- { \\langle\\frac{l}{\\lambda}\\rangle } } d^0_{h / i}(z_i,\\mu^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "*   @xmath21 is the rescaled momentum fraction of the leading parton with flavor @xmath22 , *   @xmath23 is the rescaled momentum fraction of the radiated gluon , *   @xmath24 is the average number of scatterings * and the average radiative parton energy loss is taken to be @xmath25    also @xmath26 is the transverse plane location of the hard scattering where the partons are produced , @xmath27 is the direction in which the produced hard parton travels in the medium and for most central collisions @xmath28 . in our calculation , we use @xmath24 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( motivated by the geometry ) as suggested in  @xcite . taking into account the modified parton fragmentation function , in fig .",
    "[ aaxsec ] we show the appropiate differential cross section for a @xmath12 particle final state in au + au collisions , as was done previously for p + p. notice that in both cases the 3 hadron production cross section is suppressed with respect to the 2 hadron final state result .",
    "however , this suppression is smaller in a + a collisions than in p + p collisions . dividing this ratio in a + a to that in p + p",
    ", we get as a function of @xmath31 approximately a constant : @xmath32    [ aaxsec ]   final state particle differential cross section at @xmath13 gev for au + au collisions  @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]    notice that the sole ingredient that induced this enhancement from the calculation of @xmath33 vs @xmath6 in au + au to that of p + p collisions is the energy loss of partons that hadronize collinearly .",
    "so this must be correlated to the different geometry for the trajectories of 3 as opposed to 2 particles in the final state . in order to test this idea",
    "we computed the distribution of path lengths with two and three hadrons in the final state by taking a nuclear overlap area with a distribution of scattering centers denser in the middle and decreasing toward the edge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nuclearover ] .",
    "[ nuclearover ]     [ paths ]     in each case we disregard the path length that would correspond to the trigger particle and in fig .  [ paths ] we compute the distribution of the path lengths corresponding to the away side particles . as you can see , when there are three hadrons in the final state , the large ( short ) path length in the away side is greater ( smaller ) than the case of the away side particle when there are two hadrons in the final state , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "this means that for the case of three particles in the final state , even if one of the non - leading particles with the largest path length gets absorbed by the medium , the remaining particle has a larger probability of punching through than in the case when one has two particles in the final state .",
    "so , in processes with 3 particles in the final state , there is a large probability to have one of the two away side particles being absorbed and the other randomly getting out , producing on the average , a double hump structure in the correlation studies .",
    "we want to emphasize that @xmath33 processes have to be accounted for in current heavy ion experiments , given that the medium levels out the @xmath35 processes rates . in other words ,",
    "their observation should be enhanced with respect to suppressed @xmath35 processes .",
    "moreover , we claim that this effect may have bearing on the away side shape for different kinematical cuts in au + au collisions .",
    "we realize that we need three - particle - correlation measurements to distinguish between ours and other scenarios that might be responsible for this shape in 2 particle correlation studies and in fact we are working towards providing our predictions in this context .",
