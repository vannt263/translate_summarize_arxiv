    "a spin polarized current injected into a nanostructured ferromagnet creates spin torque through the spin - transfer effect [ ] .",
    "the spin torque provides a rich variety of magnetization dynamics such as switching or self - oscillation [ ] .",
    "in particular , a spin - torque oscillator consisting of an in - plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly magnetized pinned layer has been an attractive research subject in the field of magnetism . [ ] . in this type of spin - torque oscillator , the spin torque forces the magnetization of the free layer into out of plane , and excites a large amplitude oscillation around the perpendicular axis .",
    "a high symmetry along the perpendicular direction in this system makes it easy to investigate the oscillation properties theoretically [ ] . in order to observe the oscillation experimentally through magnetoresistance effect ,",
    "however , the symmetry breaking should occur since the change of the relative angle between the magnetizations of the free and pinned layers in time is necessary .",

    "the application of an external magnetic field tilted from the perpendicular axis also breaks the symmetry and enables us to measure the oscillation experimentally .",
    "in other geometries , the experimental studies have shown that the oscillation properties such as the threshold current to excite the self - oscillation strongly depend on the field direction [ ] . on the other hand , the role of the magnetic field on the self - oscillation properties in this geometry has not been fully understood yet .",
    "for example , it is still unclear how much current is necessary to excite the out - of - plane self - oscillation in the presence of the magnetic field pointing in an arbitrary direction , while it is known that infinitesimal current can excite the self - oscillation for the highly symmetric case [ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate theoretical conditions to excite the self - oscillation in a spin - torque oscillator with an in - plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly magnetized pinned layer in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we solve the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation both numerically and analytically .",
    "the main findings in this paper are as follows .",
    "first , we find that the linearized llg equation is no longer useful to evaluate the instability threshold in the present system .",
    "the critical current density evaluated from the linearized llg equation is two orders of magnitude larger than the instability threshold estimated from the numerical simulation .",
    "second , we derive the theoretical formula determining the instability threshold .",
    "the main difference between the linear analysis and our result is that when a periodic precession around the stable state is assumed in the linear analysis , while we focus on the transition of the magnetization from the stable state to the out - of - plane self - oscillation state during a time shorter than the precession period . a good agreement between the numerical simulation and our formula is obtained .",

    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , an in - plane precession around the @xmath28 axis does not appear . in the next section",
    ", we explain the physical meanings of such behavior .",
    "the results discussed in the previous section indicates that the linear analysis is no longer applicable to evaluate the instability threshold , although the linear analysis has been widely used to analyze the spin torque induced magnetization dynamics [ ] . in this section",
    ", we clarify the reason for the breakdown of the linear analysis , and derive a theoretical formula of the threshold current density by focusing on the energy gain of the free layer generated from the work done by spin torque .      here",
    ", let us discuss the averaging technique of the llg equation on the constant energy curves .",
    "this method has been used in several works to analyze the self - oscillation and the thermally activated magnetization switching induced by spin torque , the microwave assisted magnetization reversal , and so on [ ] . as will be discussed below ,",
    "the critical current density @xmath0 introduced above corresponds to a special limit of this averaging technique .",
    "therefore , by reviewing the derivation of the averaged llg equation , the reason why the linearized llg equation does not work to estimate the instability condition accurately will be clarified .",
    "the self - oscillation is a steady precession on a constant energy curve of @xmath24 excited by the magnetic field torque ( @xmath73 ) . to maintain the precession ,",
    "the spin torque should balance with the damping torque .",
    "note however that the spin torque and the damping torque have different angular dependences .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the spin torque may overcome the damping torque at certain points on the precession trajectory , the damping torque may however overcome the spin torque at other points .",
    "the self - oscillation is maintained when the shift from the constant energy curve due to the imbalance between the spin torque and the damping torque is sufficiently small . in that case , the magnetization can return back to the original constant energy curve during the precession .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , we obtain the following averaged llg equation , @xmath74 where the integral range is a precession period on a constant energy curve of @xmath24 .",

    "since the energy density averaged over the precession is conserved in the self - oscillation state , the self - oscillation is described by the equation @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the current density necessary to excite a self - oscillation on a certain constant energy curve of @xmath24 is @xmath78}{\\oint dt [ \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{h}-(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{p})(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{h})]}.    \\label{eq : balance_current}\\ ] ] the explicit form of @xmath79 for an arbitrary @xmath24 is obtained , in principle , by substituting the solution of the precession trajectory on a constant energy curve , which is described by @xmath80 .",
    "however , the solution is hardly obtained because the equation is a nonlinear equation .",

    "a tensor damping was proposed in ref .",
    "the presence of the tensor damping was also suggested in the spin - torque problem [ ] .",
    "the effect of the tensor damping can be taken into account by replacing @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : melnikov_alpha ] ) with the tensor damping ; see appendix c of ref .",

    "note that the critical current density @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jc ] ) , obtained from the linearized llg equation relates to eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance_current ] ) via @xmath83 therefore , the fact that the critical current density @xmath0 is quite larger than the threshold current density found in the numerical simulation indicates the breakdown of applying averaged llg equation .",
    "an important assumption in the averaged llg equation is that the magnitudes of the spin torque and the damping torque are sufficiently small .",
    "thus , a shift of the magnetization from a constant energy curve due to the imbalance between these torques is also small .",
    "however , this assumption is not satisfied in the present case .",

    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , i.e. , the curves around the @xmath28 axis corresponding to @xmath44 and the curves around the @xmath1 axis corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "the constant energy curve of @xmath37 separates these in - plane and out - of - plane regions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , while the magnetization moves from the initial state to a point close to the saddle point , the magnetization crosses the constant energy curves of @xmath37 , and transfers from the in - plane region to the out - of - plane region .",

    "this result is the evidence that the assumption used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance_current ] ) , as well as eq .",
    "( [ eq : jc ] ) , is broken .",
    "therefore , the critical current density @xmath0 does not work to estimate the instability of the magnetization around the stable state accurately .",
    "the inapplicability of the linearized llg equation also relates to the value of the damping constant @xmath7 .",
    "note that both the spin torque and the damping torque move the magnetization from a constant energy curve , by either supplying or dissipating the energy from the free layer .",
    "therefore , the averaging technique of the llg equation , as well as the linearization of the llg equation , works well for low damping case .",
    "the fact that the linearized llg equation could not be applied in the above numerical simulation indicates that the value of the damping constant in the present system is high and that the precession around the stable state is not stabilized .",
    "the range of the damping constant where the linearized llg equation will be applicable is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : applicability of the present theory ] below .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] suggests that the magnetization can climb up the energy barrier @xmath85 by absorbing energy due to the work done by the spin torque during a time shorter than a precession period around the stable state .",
    "therefore , the threshold current density can be defined as a current density satisfying the following equation , @xmath86 where @xmath87 corresponds to the initial stable state . strictly speaking ,",
    "the exact solution of the llg equation is necessary to evaluate the threshold current density from eq .",
