    "miras are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars that show long - period ( hundreds of days ) photometric variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these stars typically lose mass at a rapid rate ( @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) , and this material condenses into heavy elements , molecules , and dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since agb stars account for most of the mass loss in the galaxy , their circumstellar environments are the likely factories in which many constituents of planets , and life , are produced .",
    "separating molecular emission and absorption from stellar photospheric emission is important for constraining properties of molecular layers and the underlying stars .",
    "the opacity and location of gaseous layers constrain the temperature structure in the circumstellar environments of mira stars ; this directly affects the dust condensation radius , and in turn the mass loss rate .",
    "measurements of stellar radii and temperatures uncontaminated by overlying shells of molecular emission or absorption are needed to estimate the location of mira stars in the h - r diagram .",
    "these quantities also constrain period - mass - radius relations , with direct implications for pulsational properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "historically the circumstellar environments of mira stars have been studied through high resolution infrared spectroscopy , which probed layers of co and h@xmath5o above the stellar photospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interferometric imaging , combined with spectroscopy , has more recently allowed spatially resolved measurements of radio - wavelength continuum and spectral line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mid - ir dust and molecular emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and optical / near - ir photospheric and molecular emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations showed that molecular emission lies above the stellar photosphere , and that different molecules lie at different stellocentric radii .",
    "previous near - ir interferometric observations , which probed the hottest ( @xmath6 k ) circumstellar emission , used either very low spectral resolution ( @xmath7 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a few narrow - band filters designed to probe certain molecular lines or nearly line - free regions of the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these observations provided evidence for different spatial distributions of stellar continuum and molecular radiation , but lacked the spectral resolution to clearly separate various components . with higher spectral resolution ( @xmath8 ) , one can distinguish contributions from h@xmath5o , co , and the stellar photosphere , and can even discern several of the co band - heads .",
    "higher spectral resolution data therefore allow an estimate of the relative spatial distributions of molecular emission and stellar continuum emission in mira stars .    here",
    "we present the first observations with a new grism at the keck interferometer , which enables an order of magnitude higher spectral resolution ( @xmath0 across the @xmath9-band ) than previous studies .",
    "we observed the short - period ( @xmath10 days ) mira star r vir ( aka hd 10994 , hr 4808 , or irc 10256 ) .",
    "this object varies by @xmath11 magnitudes in the visible @xcite and @xmath12 magnitudes in the @xmath9 band @xcite .",
    "the distance to r vir is @xmath13500 pc @xcite , and the mass loss rate is estimated to be @xmath14 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we observed r vir on ut 2006 may 15 using the keck interferometer ( ki ) .",
    "ki is a fringe - tracking long baseline michelson interferometer combining light from the two 10-m keck apertures @xcite .",
    "we measured @xmath9-band fringes that were spectrally dispersed through a replica grism .",
    "the grism has an undeviated wavelength of @xmath15 @xmath1 m in the first order , an apex angle and blaze angle of @xmath16 , @xmath17 grooves / mm , and an index of refraction of @xmath18 ( infrasil ) .",
    "the ki detector has a pixel size of 18.5 @xmath1 m and a camera with a focal length of @xmath19 mm .",
    "thus , the grism provides a spectral resolution of @xmath20 with 42 10-nm - wide channels across the @xmath9-band .",
    "we measured squared visibilities ( @xmath21 ) for our target and two calibrator stars in each of these spectral channels .",
    "the calibrator stars are k0-k4 giant stars , with known parallaxes , whose @xmath9 magnitudes are within 0.5 mags of the target . the system visibility ( i.e. , the point source response of the interferometer ) was measured with these calibrators , whose angular sizes were estimated by fitting blackbodies to literature photometry .",
    "the calibrator data were weighted by the internal scatter and the temporal and angular proximity to the target @xcite . source and calibrator data",
    "were corrected for detection biases as described by @xcite and averaged into 5-s blocks .",
    "the calibrated @xmath21 are the averages of 5-s blocks in each integration , with uncertainties given by the quadrature addition of the internal scatter and the uncertainty in the system visibility .",
    "we averaged our data to produce a single measurement of @xmath21 in each spectral channel .",
    "obseravtions of r vir spanned 0.7 hours , and the averaging has a negligible effect on the uv coverage . by comparing our calibrator stars to one another",
    ", we see that the channel - to - channel variations are small ( figure [ fig : cals ] ) . using hd 107328 ( spectral type k0iii ) to calibrate hd 111765 ( spectral type k4iii )",
    ", we find a standard deviation of @xmath22 in the calibrated @xmath21 versus wavelength . calibrating hd 107328 with respect to hd 111765 we find @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore adopt a channel - to - channel uncertainty of 2% for our data on r vir .    the normalization of @xmath21 versus wavelength has larger uncertainty than the channel - to - channel uncertainties discussed above .",
    "observations of a binary star with a known orbit show that the calibrated @xmath21 have a systematic uncertainty of @xmath24 .",
    "this is a discrepancy in the normalization ; if we subtract 0.04 from our measurements , the measured and predicted @xmath21 are consistent across all channels at approximately the 1% level .",
    "we do not apply this offset to our data , but assume that in addition to the 2% channel - to - channel uncertainties described above , the normalization of @xmath21 is uncertain by @xmath25% .",
    "we used the counts in each channel observed during `` foreground integrations '' @xcite to recover a crude spectrum for our target .",
    "we divided the measured flux versus wavelength for r vir by the observed flux from an a1v star ( smoothed over the br@xmath26 feature at 2.16 @xmath1 m ) and multiplied by a 9000 k blackbody to calibrate the spectral bandpass .",
    "while our spatially filtered data may contain relatively less flux at shorter wavelengths due to the larger effect of atmospheric turbulence , such slopes should be removed through our spectral calibration .",
    "we estimate that the channel - to - channel uncertainties are @xmath2510%",
    ". however there may be larger systematic errors due to different @xmath9 magnitudes of the target star and the a1v spectral calibrator or changing atmospheric or instrumental conditions between the source and calibrator observations .",
    "we normalized our calibrated photometry and then converted to flux units by assuming a @xmath9 magnitude of 2.0 based on the current visual phase and previously studied @xmath9-band variability .",
    "we begin with a simple model consisting of a star surrounded by a single - temperature shell whose optical depth varies with wavelength ( essentially a schuster - schwarzschild model ) .",
    "we assume the star emits blackbody emission from a compact continuum - forming atmosphere .",
    "we ignore limb darkening , which may affect the stellar radius by @xmath27 @xcite ; the effect is comparable to the assumed uncertainties in the data . the free parameters of the model are the stellar angular radius and temperature , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the shell radius and temperature , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the optical depth of the shell at each wavelength , @xmath32 . since we must determine the best - fit value of @xmath33 at each observed wavelength , the model has 46 free parameters .",
    "we measure @xmath21 and flux in each spectral channel , and we have 84 data points with which to constrain these parameters .",
    "this model has been used previously to model narrow - band interferometric observations of mira stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can be used to estimate the relative spatial distributions of stellar and circumstellar emission . moreover ,",
    "comparison of the fitted @xmath32 with that expected for different molecules ( based on laboratory spectroscopy ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) constrains which molecules are present in the circumstellar environment .",
    "we construct the model by considering sight - lines from the center of the star out to the limb of the shell , and summing the contributions from each line - of - sight .",
    "the specific intensity of the model includes emission from both the star and the shell for sight - lines @xmath34 : @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{eq : inu1}\\ ] ] for @xmath36 , only the shell contributes : @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eq : inu2}\\ ] ] we compute the flux and normalized visibility for a series of annuli of infinitesimal angular width ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sum over all annuli to obtain @xmath38 and @xmath21 for the model .",
    "we fit our data to the modeled @xmath38 and @xmath21 using a levenberg - marquardt non - linear least squares fitting algorithm .      instead of considering a shell with arbitrary optical depth @xmath32 ( and 42 associated free parameters ) , we can use molecular opacities calculated for stellar atmosphere models ( hauschildt private communication ) .",
    "we replace @xmath32 with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the molecular cross section ( as a function of wavelength ) for a single layer in the hauschildt atmospheric model , and @xmath41 is the column density of the layer .",
    "this column density assumes a mix of different molecules ( h@xmath5 , co , and h@xmath5o , among others ) , and the relative abundances are determined through self - consistent modeling of a cool stellar atmosphere . since the relative abundances of h@xmath5 and h@xmath5o and co may be lower in a shell than in a dense atmosphere , our fitted column density for the shell may be over - estimated .",
    "the free parameters for this model are @xmath42 and @xmath29 , the molecular layer radius and temperature , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and the column density of the molecules within the layer , @xmath45 .",
    "our modeling indicates that the stellar radius is @xmath46 mas ( @xmath47 r@xmath3 assuming a distance of 450 pc ) and the stellar temperature is @xmath483800 k ( table [ tab : models ] ; figure [ fig : shellfits ] ) .",
    "the shell of molecular material is cooler and located at a larger radius : @xmath49 mas ( @xmath50 r@xmath3 ) and @xmath511900 k.    we have assumed in our models that the molecular material around r vir resides in an infinitesimally thin shell . however material is probably distributed over a range of radii , and different molecules at different temperatures may contribute to the optical depth .",
    "our simple assumption may be partially responsible for differences between the modeled opacity and that expected from molecular line - lists ( figure [ fig : taus ] ) .",
    "deviations from spherical symmetry , not included in our models , may also contribute to differences between models and data .",
    "the inferred temperature of the molecular shell is substantially higher than the expected condensation temperature for dust around mira stars ( @xmath52 k ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust at larger radii , but within the 50 mas ( @xmath53 au ) field of view of our observations could contribute some over - resolved flux , which would reduce the measured @xmath21 and increase the measured flux .",
    "this should be a minor effect given the small amount of @xmath9-band flux from any cool extended dust relative to that in the hot , compact molecular shell modeled above ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis suggests that the molecules ( predominantly h@xmath5o ) responsible for most of the opacity in the circumstellar environment of r vir form at approximately twice the radius of the stellar photosphere . the molecular material can not be supported by hydrostatic forces at this radius .",
    "propagating shocks associated with the pulsation of mira stars can lead to molecular densities at these radii orders of magnitude larger than predicted by hydrostatic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and shocks thus provide a mechanism for lifting the molecular layer in r vir to its observed location .",
    "the radius and temperature of the molecular shell imply radiative equilibrium with the stellar continuum radiation , suggesting that if the shell lies in a post - shock region , it has had time to cool . at the molecular densities in such a shell",
    "the radiative cooling time is typically longer than the time between successive shocks .",
    "it is more likely that the molecular material in r vir cooled via expansion ; in a rapidly expanding shell associated with a high mass loss rate the cooling time is shorter than the time between shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our model fits imply a stellar radius and temperature of @xmath47 r@xmath3 and @xmath54 k. previous broadband measurements of mira diameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which measured contributions from stellar photospheres and molecular layers , found large stellar radii , which yielded period - mass - radius relations that were consistent with overtone mode pulsation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the smaller radius determined in this work ( and radii determined for other miras from spectrally dispersed or narrow band interferometric observations ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is consistent with the period - mass - radius relationship expected for fundamental mode pulsations , compatible with other lines of argument that miras should pulsate in the fundamental mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a logical next step is to compare spectrally dispersed interferometry data to dynamic , self - consistent models of mira atmospheres that include the effects of h@xmath5o opacity .",
    "we attempted such comparisons but currently - available models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have longer periods and are either hotter or have larger photometric variability amplitudes than our target .",
    "these models predict too much flux and not enough h@xmath5o to match our data .",
    "more appropriate models will become available in the near future ( ireland private communication ) .",
    "moreover we will obtain additional observations of r vir , enabling a comparison of models and data over a range of pulsation phases    data presented herein were obtained at the w.m .",
