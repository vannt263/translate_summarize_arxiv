    "the values of @xmath5 resulting from this representation of the results are the same as may be determined from figs .",

    "the proposed approach allows to scale the normal - state magnetization @xmath3 data in a way that the @xmath4 curves calculated from experimental @xmath3 data collected in different magnetic fields collapse onto the same master curve .",
    "because a diamagnetic contribution to @xmath20 due to superconductivity depends on magnetic field in a way , which is quite different from that for the normal - state magnetization , the onset of superconductivity leads to a rather pronounced divergence between the @xmath4 curves corresponding to different magnetic fields , as it may clearly be seen in figs . 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11(b ) and 13 .",
    "this allows for an unambiguous determination of @xmath5 corresponding to the onset of superconducting diamagnetism .",
    "accuracy of @xmath5 is determined by an experimental scatter of @xmath42 data and by distances between neighboring @xmath42 data points .",
    "we remind that the proposed approach relies only on rather general properties of the normal - state magnetization and does not include any specific assumptions , which can not be independently verified .",
    "we also note that the possibility to check the quality of scaling at temperatures well above @xmath60 serves as some consistency check .",
