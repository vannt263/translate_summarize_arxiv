    "the 6@xmath25@xmath3 transition of water ( emitted rest - frequency of 22.23508 ghz ) shows spectacularly luminous extra - galactic maser emission , with isotropic line luminosities of up to 23000@xmath4 ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the maser action results from collisional excitation of water molecules in extremely dense gas clouds and requires particle densities of 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6  @xmath7 and gas temperatures @xmath8300k .",
    "all interferometric studies of powerful water masers ( @xmath810@xmath4 ) found thus far have always shown them to be associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "high - resolution studies with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) of @xmath910 of these systems have shown that the water masers are associated with either the circumnuclear accretion disk within a few parsecs of the central supermassive black hole @xcite or within the inner part ( @xmath1030  pc ) of the relativistic radio jets that are ejected from some agn @xcite .",
    "the high surface brightness and proximity to the central engine make water maser systems a powerful tool for studying the properties of agn . for example",
    ", water masers have been used to measure the mass of the central supermassive black hole @xcite , the size and structure of the circumnuclear accretion disk @xcite , the shock speeds and densities of radio jets @xcite , and to determine accurate geometrical distances to the host galaxies @xcite  all of which are competitive with the results obtained using other methods .",
    "surveys for water maser systems at low redshifts ( @xmath110.06 ) have tended to focus on seyfert 2 and liner galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the expected edge - on orientation of the circumnuclear accretion disk for these galaxies should result in a larger path length of velocity - coherent molecular gas which is needed for the maser amplification .",
    "the success rate of these surveys is of order @xmath95 per cent , with around @xmath9130 water maser galaxies currently known locally ( e.g. @xcite ; and unpublished ) .",
    "surveys have also targeted nearby spiral and starburst galaxies with bright far - infrared ( fir ) flux - denisties @xcite .",
    "these surveys have found 15 water maser galaxies and have a detection rate of 23 per cent @xcite .",
    "a snapshot survey of 611 luminous active and non - active galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath12  5000 km ) was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they found only 8 water maser systems ( a detection rate of about @xmath9  1 per cent ) , which demonstrates the rarity of these objects . finding water maser galaxies at higher redshifts has the potential to constrain the nature of dark energy through the accurate measurement of geometrical distances .",
    "however , due to the limited sensitivities and the small range of frequencies covered by current radio telescopes , surveys for high redshift water maser galaxies had yielded non - detections @xcite , with the notable exception being the detection of the most luminous water maser system known in a type 2 quasar at redshift 0.66 @xcite .    to overcome the sensitivity limitations",
    "we have started a search for water masers from known gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "observing only gravitationally lensed active galaxies has the advantage of pre - selecting a population of distant agn ( @xmath13 ) and of using the magnification provided by the foreground gravitational lensing galaxy to increase the observed flux density of any water masers in the background agn .",
    "such lensing magnifications can range up to hundreds , depending on the alignment of the lens and the background source .",
    "the gravitational lensing technique has already been used successfully to study the interstellar medium and molecular gas content of high redshift quasars through the detection of , for example , carbon monoxide @xcite .",
    "we found a luminous water maser in the first gravitationally lensed quasar we observed , in the type 1 quasar mg j0414 + 0534 at redshift 2.64 @xcite , which is by far the most distant object to show water vapour emission .",
    "the maser line from mg j0414 + 0534 is broad with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath945 kms@xmath14 , is blueshifted by @xmath15300  kms@xmath14 from the systemic velocity of the quasar and has an ( unlensed ) apparent isotropic luminosity of @xmath98300  @xmath4 .",
    "our initial hypothesis , based on spectra obtained with the expanded very large array ( evla ) and the effelsberg radio telescope , was that the maser originates in the relativistic jet of this quasar as it interacts with a molecular cloud lying close to the supermassive black hole .",
    "follow - up vlbi and monitoring observations are currently being analyzed to investigate this hypothesis and will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "we have now begun a survey of other distant gravitationally lensed quasars , and have also extended our search to lensed starbursting galaxies , using the effelsberg radio telescope and the evla .",
    "the aim of this survey is to find additional detections of high redshift water masers , the results of which are presented in this paper . in the case of the only currently confirmed high redshift water maser galaxy , mg j0414 + 0534 , we know that the source is highly dust reddened and hosts a powerful agn that is emitting a relativistic jet .",
    "this suggests that luminous water masers that are associated with agn are more likely to be found in high redshift galaxies with large amounts of dust and/or powerful radio jets . to investigate the first of these possible effects , we have limited the sample studied in this paper to include only radio - quiet quasars and star - forming galaxies with previously measured strong far - infrared ( fir ) emission or molecular co line emission .    for all calculations we adopt an @xmath16  0.3 , @xmath17  0.7 spatially flat universe , with a hubble constant of @xmath18  70  kms@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , and a solar luminosity of @xmath19  3.939  @xmath20  10@xmath21 w.",
    "we targeted and prioritized those gravitational lens systems with i ) background agn or star - forming galaxies at redshifts between 2.29 and 2.87 ( due to the bandpass of the receiver that was used ) , ii ) had high lensing magnifications and iii ) showed previous detections of molecular emission ( e.g. co , hcn , etc . ) or a large fir luminosity .",
    "we also limited our sample to those objects that were observable with the effelsberg radio telescope and the evla .",
    "the resulting sample is not statistically complete .",
    "rx j0911 + 0551 is comprised of four images of an x - ray detected quasar at redshift 2.80 @xcite , which is gravitationally lensed by a group of galaxies at redshift 0.769 @xcite .",
    "the total magnification of the quasar is @xmath922 .",
    "co ( 32 ) has been tentatively detected by @xcite and the large sub - mm luminosity of the lensed quasar suggests a cold dust mass of @xmath910@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "iras  10214 + 4724 is a highly magnified and dust obscured gravitationally lensed quasar at redshift 2.285 @xcite .",
    "this system has four lensed images that are formed by a massive foreground lensing galaxy at redshift 0.893 @xcite .",
    "the magnification of the three merging lensed images is @xmath23100 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lensed source is extremely luminous in the fir @xcite and sub - mm @xcite , and optical polarimetry found evidence of scattered light ( @xcite ) . a large quantity of molecular gas from co @xcite",
    ", hcn @xcite and neutral carbon @xcite has also been reported . finally , near - infrared imaging spectroscopy found evidence for both circumnuclear star formation and an agn from narrow ( but spatially extended ) and broad h@xmath24 emission @xcite .",
    "all of these data are consistent with the central engine of the agn being obscured and there being nuclear driven star - formation in a region rich in molecular gas .",
    "h  1413 + 117 has four lensed images of a radio - quiet quasar at redshift 2.560 that are in the shape of a cloverleaf @xcite .",
    "the optical emission from the four lensed images is so strong that attempts to measure the redshift of the lens have not been successful .",
    "the total magnification of the background quasar is estimated to be @xmath910 @xcite .",
    "the system has a plethora of molecular emission and absorption detections ; for example , co ( 32 ; @xcite , 43 , 54 , 76 ; @xcite and 56 , 87 , 98 ; @xcite ) , hcn ( 10 ;",
    "@xcite ) and cn ( 32 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the quasar is also ultra - luminous in the sub - mm and has an estimated dust mass of @xmath94@xmath2010@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "previous observations searching for maser activity failed to detect any water maser emission from this quasar down to an unlensed isotropic luminosity limit of 4600  @xmath4 , with a 10  kms@xmath14 spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "ms 1512@xmath15cb58 is a star - forming lyman break galaxy at redshift 2.727 which is gravitationally lensed by the massive cluster ms 1512 + 36 at redshift 0.37 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is lensed into a gravitational arc by the cluster and is estimated to have a high total magnification of @xmath2550 @xcite .",
    "co ( 32 ) has been detected from the galaxy @xcite , which along with the large potential maser magnification led to ms 1512@xmath15cb58 being included in our sample .",
    "smm j16359 + 6612 is composed of three lensed images of a pair of merging galaxies at redshift 2.516 .",
    "the lens is the massive cluster a2218 at redshift 0.18 , and provides a total magnification of @xmath945 @xcite .",
    "the merging lensed galaxies show strong sub - mm emission @xcite and a number of co detections ( transitions 32 , 43 , 54 , 65 , 76 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "smm j16359 + 6612 was recently observed for water maser emission with the evla by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , no water vapour was detected down to an unlensed luminosity of @xmath95400@xmath4 within a 10 kms@xmath14 channel .",
    "in this section , our observations with the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope and subsequent follow - up observations with the evla of tentative water maser detections are presented .",
    "the spectroscopic observations with the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope were carried out with the 5 cm dual - polarization hemt receiver at the primary focus .",
    "this receiver is sensitive between 5.75 and 6.75 ghz , which for the detection of 22.2  ghz water masers corresponds to a redshift range of 2.29 to 2.87 .",
    "the primary beam of the telescope at these frequencies has a fwhm of @xmath9120  arcsec , which is easily large enough to encompass the angular extent of the gravitationally lensed images .",
    "the data were taken using the position - switching mode where a 2.5  min on - source scan was immediately followed by a 2.5  min off - source scan .",
    "this off - source scan was subtracted from the on - source scan to remove the contribution of the sky background and the instrument from the on - source measurements .",
    "observations of standard flux - density calibrators were also taken to determine the antenna gain ( 3c295 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra were formed using the 16384-channel fast fourier transform spectrometer ( ffts ; @xcite ) .",
    "both the 20 and 100 mhz bandwidths that are available with the ffts were used during these observations .",
    "a summary of the integration times , observing dates and bandwidths used for each lens system is given in table [ obs - log ] .",
    "the spectra were analysed using the class77 package within gildas .",
    "each scan was inspected for any strong gain variations or radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , with any spurious scans or frequency ranges flagged .",
    "the scans were then averaged to form a spectrum of the lens system for each observing epoch .",
    "a low - order polynomial was then fitted to the spectrum to subtract any continuum emission from the lensed images . for those lens systems that were observed on more than one occasion ,",
    "an average spectrum weighted by the integration times was also produced .",
    "we smoothed the spectra using hanning smoothing to a spectral resolution of 10  kms@xmath14  channel@xmath14 .",
    "where we found a possible water maser line , a gaussian line profile was fitted to the unsmoothed spectrum to determine the fwhm , the integrated line flux , the line peak flux density and the line velocity .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ predictions ]    ( 6,7.8 ) ( -3.5,8.6 )",
    "we have presented new radio spectra for five gravitationally lensed quasars and star - forming galaxies at redshifts between 2.29 and 2.80 .",
    "we searched these galaxies for 22 ghz ( rest frame ) water masers that potentially could be used to study the properties of their central supermassive black hole .",
    "no new water masers were found , although , we do have a tentative detection of water vapour from the quasar iras 10214 + 4724 at redshift 2.285 .",
    "our survey has now searched for water masers in six gravitationally lensed quasars and star - forming galaxies , doubling the number of high redshift lensed galaxies surveyed so far , and finding the only known high redshift water maser system @xcite .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the high redshift water maser luminosity function that is based on the results from this paper and from @xcite .",
    "we again confirm that there must be some evolution in the water maser luminosity function to explain the detection of the luminous ( 8300  @xmath4 ) water maser system from mg j0414 + 0534 at redshift 2.64 .",
    "we therefore conclude that water masers are more abundant at higher redshifts than found locally , and surveys with the next generation of radio arrays have the potential to find many more water maser systems in the future",
