    "the study of the nature of pairing correlations is one of the most fundamental problems in nuclear physics .",
    "these correlations have been introduced in the study of nuclear structure in analogy with the case of metals @xcite and since then played an important role in the understanding of many aspects of nuclear behaviour , because they affect static and dynamic properties of atomic nuclei , their structure as well as their reactions .",
    "one can quote , for example , the systematic staggering of the odd - even mass difference ( section 2 - 1 in @xcite ) , the reduction of the moment of inertia of collective rotational bands as compared to the rigid - body value ( section 4 - 3 in @xcite ) , the enhancement of the two - particle transfer reactions to specific final states @xcite , the appearance of signals in both one - particle pick - up and stripping reactions for the same single - particle orbit near the fermi level ( section 5 - 3 in @xcite ) , the lifetimes of @xmath1 decay in the heavy mass region @xcite and so on .",
    "influence of the pairing gap can be also found in the spectra of deformed nuclei.@xmath2 namely , the spacing of the low - lying non - collective excited states ( band heads ) in odd nuclei is reduced in average due to the pairing gap @xcite .",
    "two - quasiparticle states are of relatively high energy in heavy even - even nuclei , because breaking the pair costs energy .",
    "the feature analogous to the latter can be seen also in odd nuclei ( sections 5 - 2 and 5 - 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between the pairing and the other degrees of freedom also plays an important role .",
    "for example , pairing correlations are suppressed by rotation @xcite . since pairing correlations",
    "play such an important role , it is crucial to ask what is their origin .",
    "pairing correlations in finite nuclei have mostly been studied in mean field theory through bcs and hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations , making use of phenomenological interactions , the monopole pairing interaction having probably been the most often used ( e.  g. @xcite ) .",
    "the list of the interactions may include the quadrupole pairing interaction ( used for improving the monopole pairing interaction , see e.  g. @xcite for rotation and @xcite for the pairing vibration . ) , the surface - delta interaction e.  g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , density - dependent zero - range pairing forces @xcite , the gogny force , @xcite and @xcite , and so on .",
    "recently , several studies have been devoted to pairing in nuclei near the drip line , for which it is crucial that the pairing force treats correctly the interplay between the discrete and continuum unperturbed single - particle levels correctly : that is , summation of the unbound components of many - body wavefunction caused by the interplay must be canceled out @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the connections of pairing correlations in finite nuclei with the bare interactions , that is , on interactions which reproduce the properties of scattering of free nucleons , have been very scarce in finite nuclei ( for a few exceptions , cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", this represents an important line of research in nuclear matter ( @xcite@xcite and references therein ) and in its applications to nuclear astrophysics , where for example pairing plays a very important role in the cooling of the neutron stars by neutrino emission ( e.  g. @xcite ) .",
    "also much studied have been the effects of medium polarization on pairing correlations . in terms of field theory",
    "this effect is given by bubble diagrams of the particle - hole excitations @xcite@xcite .",
    "in the limit of infinite number of the bubbles , one can think of an interaction between nucleons mediated by the exchange of phonons ( phonon - induced interaction ) .",
    "in this idea the coupling , or vertex , between particle@xmath3 and phonon is crucially important , and the influences of this coupling on many properties of phonons as well as of particles have been investigated intensively in finite nuclei , although not its effect on pairing correlations . in particular , the coupling with low - lying surface vibrations renormalizes the single - particle motion in an essential way , shifting the energy of the levels and changing the level density and the effective mass around the fermi surface , and producing a significant breaking of the single - particle strength for the levels lying far from the fermi surface @xcite,@xcite .    a formulation which can properly investigate the effect of the particle - phonon coupling on pairing correlations in nuclei was already proposed in 1960 s by belyaev et al .",
    "@xcite and migdal et al .",
    "@xcite on the basis of field theory .",
    "the key point of the method is to introduce anomalous ( pairing ) green functions in addition to normal green functions . in condensed matter physics",
    "this formulation was introduced by gorkov @xcite and nambu @xcite , and the original dynamical equation was rearranged with approximations characteristic in the metal and is known as eliashberg equation @xcite or gorkov equation , which was shown to be powerful in the calculation of the tunneling probability .",
    "a relatively recent review is given by @xcite .",
    "the application of the particle - phonon coupling to pairing problems in finite nuclei has been , however , surprisingly rare .",
    "recently barranco et al .",
    "solved bcs equation with the phonon - induced interaction obtained according to bloch - horowitz perturbation @xcite .",
    "they have also shown the crucial importance of this coupling for the stability of the halo nucleus @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "avdeenkov and kamerdzhiev @xcite solve the dyson equation in the linear approximation .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "keeping in mind the historical background described above , we investigate in this paper the effect of the phonon - induced interaction on nuclear pairing correlations .",
    "we solve the dyson equation consisting of the one - body as well as anomalous green functions for particle - phonon coupled systems and calculate the pairing gaps .",
    "the phonon is treated as an independent degree of freedom . in nuclei , this is a technique to treat complicated diagrams of interaction nonperturbatively .",
    "introduction of the anomalous green function can be understood also as this kind of technique .",
    "it is emphasized that in the field - theoretical approach it is possible to include effects beyond the mean field as well as the mean pair - field approximation , which manifest themself in the fragmentation of the single - particle strength . after making a choice of proper self - energy diagrams , we solve dyson equation with the minimum of approximations , being careful not to suppress the effects beyond bcs .",
    "thus the most significant point of this study is that we investigate the pairing correlation without assuming a priori that the single - particle or quasiparticle picture is good .",
    "in addition a class of diagrams is included nonperturbatively in the calculation .",
    "we shall pay attention also to relation between this approach and diagonalization of particle - phonon coupled hamiltonian in the many - body plus phonon space .",
    "finally let us mention two more groups concerning the dyson equation in nuclear - structure .",
    "one of them is mther and dickhoff et al .",
    "they developed an approximate way to solve dyson equation @xcite ( without the anomalous green function ) and applied their method to doubly - magic nuclei @xcite@xcite with a nucleon - nucleon interaction , emphasizing fragmentation of the single - particle strength .",
    "an application was made also to nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "another group which we note is waroquier et al .",
    "they proposed another way to approximate a solution of dyson equation and applied it to some nuclei @xcite .",
    "they performed calculation also for an open - shell nucleus @xcite using a formulation which includes a concept of the pairing gap , however , the gap was not discussed in their paper .",
    "this group uses both nucleon - nucleon interaction and particle - phonon coupling .",
    "a comparison was made of the two methods of the groups in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we discuss the formulation and describe our way to solve the dyson equation .",
    "we also consider the relation between diagrams with and without the anomalous green functions . in the next section",
    "detailed comparisons are made between the solution of dyson equation and the diagonalization of the particle - phonon coupled hamiltonian .",
    "section 4 shows results of the calculation of the neutrons in @xmath0sn using dyson equation .",
    "we discuss the spectral functions , pairing gaps , the single - particle energy shifts and the pairing energy .",
    "bcs approximation is discussed briefly in section 5 .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary .",
    "the equations used in this paper are derived thoroughly in appendices .",
    "appendix a is for the derivation of the diagram rule .",
    "the self - energy used in the calculation is derived in appendix b. the next appendix is about the general form of the particle green functions , and some useful relations are derived .",
    "appendix d treats equations for calculating the poles and the residues .",
    "the equations of the total energy and the pairing gaps are derived in appendices e and f , respectively .",

    "@xmath15 is determined so as to obtain a right expectation value of the nucleon number @xmath69 for the nucleus under consideration .",
    "it is worthy to discuss what would happen if the energy denominators in eqs .",
    "( [ slf - e - f1 ] ) and ( [ slf - e - f2 ] ) become very small around the poles of the particle green function .",

    "the sum rule of the single - particle strength must be satisfied : @xmath74 therefore if the small - energy denominators are encountered so often , then the single - particle strength becomes distributed among many poles , leading to a strong fragmentation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism means a technical advantage of dyson method because the small - energy denominators do not cause severe problems as can happen in rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory .    if the @xmath8-dependence of the self - energy @xmath19 is ignored , then det@xmath75 , see eq .",

    "2b we illustrate a magnification in a neighborhood of a singularity .",

    "it is noted that the zero - point a in fig .",
    "2b is a spurious pole , because the curve becomes discontinuous at the point a with @xmath76 , and thus the pole disappears . in our experience",
    "the residue @xmath77 for the point a , calculated using eq .",
    "( [ z11 ] ) , is usually negative .",
    "we note that effect of the off - diagonal green functions @xmath78 are assumed small and neglected in this paper .",
    "@xcite and @xcite )    now let us consider a field theoretical question related to the anomalous green function .",
    "is it possible to express diagrams including the anomalous green functions in terms of the normal green functions ?",
    "let us assume an equation @xmath79 the left diagram is a two - body green function carrying the pairing correlations expressed without the anomalous green functions ( see section 34 , chapter 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the ladder diagram of the phonons may be included in the complicated diagram .",
    "the right - hand side indicates the anomalous green functions in the notation of migdal .",
    "( cf section 1.3.4 in @xcite . ) in this discussion , a line represents not a 2 by 2 matrix but either a normal or a anomalous nucleon green function .",
    "one of components of the correlation energy associated with the solution of dyson equation can be written , up to a factor , as @xmath80 where the thick lines are perturbed green functions , and the thin lines are unperturbed ones",
    ". therefore it is seen that the diagrams of the following type are included in the proper self - energy in the dyson equation : @xmath81 ( see also chap .  2 in @xcite . )",
    "in order to understand this field - theoretical calculation from a viewpoint of a method more familiar to the nuclear - structure physics , we made a comparison with a diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are unperturbed particle and phonon hamiltonians , respectively .",

    "if strong signals are observed in both pick - up and stripping reactions for the same orbit near the fermi level with the same @xmath152 , this would be a clear indication of pairing correlations .",
    "the particle - phonon coupling influences of course also the single - particle spectrum .",
    "we show the perturbed as well as unperturbed spectra in fig .",

    "the increase in the level density in the vicinity of the fermi level is a known effect of the coupling ( section 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated also the pairing energy ( see appendix e ) : @xmath157 and obtained @xmath158 = @xmath513.9 mev .",
    "this approximation was introduced in section 2 as the initial guess for solving dyson equation . from the viewpoint of green function method ,",
    "bcs approximation is a normalized - quasiparticle approximation .",

    "if the self - energy has no @xmath8-dependence , then the single - particle strength is distributed to only two poles at most .",
    "next we compare analytically the present dyson calculation and the bcs + bloch - horowitz calculation in @xcite .",

    "we showed the formulation from the viewpoint to clarify how to solve the equation in such a way that the effect beyond bcs is not suppressed .",
    "the comparison was made between the solutions of dyson equation and diagonalization of the particle - phonon coupled hamiltonian , and we clarified both difference and similarity .",

    "the similarity of the solutions is clear when the model does not have strong the fragmentation effect of the single - particle strength .",
    "we have solved dyson equation for the neutrons in @xmath0sn and calculated the pairing gaps .",
    "the average pairing gap near the fermi level arising from the phonon - induced interaction is around 40 % of the observed gap from the odd - even mass difference .",
    "according to the spectral functions the quasiparticle picture is not perfect but acceptable for many of the single - particle orbits near the fermi level except for 2d@xmath91 .",
    "this level is more than 2 mev below the fermi level , however , the orbit has the appreciable magnitude of the pairing gap .",
    "this gap arises mainly from the @xmath100 phonon coupling , of which the vertex matrix has only off - diagonal elements . for this reason the pairing gap as a function of the unperturbed single - particle energy does not have a completely - smooth shape peaked at the fermi level . as for the overall shape ,",
    "the pairing gap arising from the phonon - induced interaction is of the surface type .",
    "we have discussed also the bcs + bloch - horowitz calculation .",

    "the latter method has always negative , i.  e. non - zero , energy denominators in the pairing gap .",
    "several further steps are needed , in order to obtain a complete quantitative assessment of the contribution of the particle - phonon coupling to the nuclear pairing correlations .",
    "first , the vertex correction of the self - energy should be investigated .",
    "in fact , our present calculation is partially nonperturbative and partially perturbative .",
    "needless to say , it is a nonperturbative effect that the pairing gaps were obtained using the single - particle basis . on the other hand ,",
    "the vertex was treated in the lowest perturbation .",
    "it will be necessary also to combine the phonon - induced interaction with a bare nn interaction into the self - energy for understanding the nuclear pairing correlations fully microscopically , and to look for an adequate hartree - fock basis consistent with the effective mass arising from the particle - phonon coupling .",
    "one may be also concerned with breaking of the particle - number conservation . since we calculate the pairing gap in a finite - body system , the particle number is not conserved .",
