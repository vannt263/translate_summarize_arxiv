    "radiative @xmath0-decay offers the opportunity of studying -odd momentum correlations which do not appear in ordinary @xmath0-decay  @xcite .",
    "we consider a correlation characterized by the kinematical variable @xmath2 , so that it is both parity - and naively time - reversal -odd but independent of the particle spin .",
    "its spin independence renders it distinct from searches for permanent electric - dipole - moments ( edms ) of neutrons and nuclei . the inability of the standard model ( sm ) to explain the cosmic baryon asymmetry prompts the search for sources of -violation which do not appear within it and which are not constrained by other experiments .",
    "a triple momentum correlation in radiative @xmath0-decay is one such example , as we shall illustrate ; under the -theorem , -violation is linked to -violation . a decay correlation , however",
    ", can be , by its very nature , only `` naively '' or `` pseudo '' -odd , that is , only motion - reversal odd . as a result , although the appearance of a -odd decay correlation can be engendered by sources of -violation beyond the standard model , it can also be generated without fundamental - or -violation . in this paper",
    "we compute the size of the -odd momentum correlation in radiative @xmath0-decay simulated by electromagnetic final - state interactions in the sm  @xcite .",
    "this is crucial to establishing a baseline in the search for new sources of -violation in such processes .",
    "our work is motivated in large part by the determination that pseudo - chern - simons terms appear in su(2)@xmath5u(1 ) gauge theories at low energies  and that they can impact low - energy weak radiative processes involving baryons  @xcite . in the sm",
    "such pseudo - chern - simons interactions are -conserving , but considered broadly they are not , so that searching for the - and -odd effects that -violating interactions of pseudo - chern - simons form would engender offers a new window on physics beyond the sm  @xcite .",
    "searches for -violating decay correlations in neutron and nuclear @xmath0-decay have a long history .",
    "the best experimental limits are on the so - called @xmath6 term , which appears as the triple correlation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the polarization of the decaying particle  @xcite . these limits still greatly exceed the size of the @xmath6 correlation expected from sm final - state interactions  @xcite .",

    "we evaluate the -odd asymmetry in radiative @xmath0-decay from electromagnetic radiative corrections in the sm and focus on the neutron case : @xmath10 .",
    "the motion - reversal - odd terms in the decay rate , which mimic the appearance of -violation , are engendered by the interference of the tree - level amplitude with the imaginary part of the @xmath4 corrected amplitude , which is determined by the physical two - particle cuts and hence mediated by the scattering of particles on their mass shells  @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we detail the computation of the interference terms and their components , as well as the resulting numerical integration over the allowed phase space to yield the -odd asymmetry @xmath3 .",
    "our results are exact in @xmath4 up to corrections of recoil order , namely , up to terms of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an energy scale which is small with respect to the nucleon mass @xmath13 .",
    "this certitude is guaranteed by the small @xmath14-value of the decay , so that @xmath15 , and by low s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the natural scale of hadron excitations is set by the pion mass @xmath16 ; consequently , in neutron radiative @xmath0-decay @xmath17 as well , and non - electromagnetic final - state interactions can not contribute to the physical two - particle cuts .",
    "this is in contradistinction to @xmath9 decay for which such contributions are appreciable , albeit relatively small  @xcite .",
    "we relegate intermediate results essential for our final results but yet nonessential to the flow of our discussion to appendices .",
    "since we neglect all terms of recoil order , our results can be immediately translated to the computation of @xmath3 in nuclear and hyperon radiative @xmath0-decays as well .",
    "we consider , in particular , the pattern in @xmath3 predicated by variations in the @xmath14-value of the decay as well as by the nuclear dependence of the axial - vector coupling constant .",
    "we assess the size of undetermined corrections before offering a final summary of our results .",

    "before presenting our final results for the asymmetry , there are three important remarks to be made concerning our numerical evaluation of the integral of @xmath134 over the allowed phase space .",

    "second , we note that the contributions from the diagrams of the @xmath115 cuts each contain an infrared divergence ; we regulate this by inserting a fictitious photon mass @xmath136 .",
    "however , as we show in appendix b , the infrared divergence cancels in the net contribution to the asymmetry from the @xmath115 cuts .",
    "the remaining piece is thus finite and well - defined , and we can safely set @xmath136 to zero . finally , we note it is most convenient to choose a restricted range in the @xmath93 opening angle . as one can see from the formulae in the appendix a , the solutions to the passarino - veltman equations become invalid if the opening angle @xmath137 between the outgoing electron and the photon is exactly equal to 0 or to @xmath138 .",
    "there is no physical divergence .",
    "rather , the spatial components of the vector and tensor equations to determine the relevant coefficients become degenerate at such a boundary .",
    "potentially one could remove this difficulty by solving the equations for infinitesimal values of @xmath137 or @xmath139 and then interpolating the solutions to the needed @xmath140 and @xmath138 points . in our present work ,",

    "the latter is proportional to @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a baryon momentum and @xmath163 .",
