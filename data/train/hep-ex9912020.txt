    "production of four pions in @xmath7 annihilation is now well studied in the c.m .",
    "energy range 1.05 to 2.5 gev ( see @xcite and references therein ) . much less is known about this process at energies below the @xmath8 meson mass .",
    "the first attempts to observe it resulted in detection of single events above 0.96 gev by orsay groups @xcite while scans of the energy range 0.64 to 1.00 gev by novosibirsk groups placed upper limits only @xcite .",
    "these observations confirmed the predictions that the cross section is very small at these energies @xcite .",
    "the situation was improved in 1992 when the upgraded high luminosity collider vepp-2 m resumed its operation at the budker institute of nuclear physics in novosibirsk @xcite .",
    "with two modern detectors cmd-2 @xcite and snd @xcite various high precision measurements in the c.m .",
    "energy range from the threshold of hadron production to 1.4 gev became possible .",
    "cmd-2 has recently published results of their analysis of the four pion production above the @xmath8 meson @xcite .",
    "the large data sample allowed a precise measurement of the energy dependence of the cross section and revealed the intermediate states through which final pions are produced .",
    "it was shown that while the reaction @xmath9 proceeds through the @xmath10 and @xmath11 intermediate states , it is the latter which dominates in the @xmath12 channel .    in this paper , we extend the analysis of the process @xmath1 to the c.m .  energy range from 0.60 to 0.97 gev . the high integrated luminosity allowed observation of 153 @xmath3  events and the first measurement of the corresponding cross section at a level as low as several tenths of pb .",
    "the experiment was performed in spring 1998 when the energy range from 0.97 down to 0.60 gev was scanned with a typical step of 10 mev outside the @xmath4 and @xmath13 resonances and 1 mev near the peak of the resonances . to decrease statistical errors , in the final analysis",
    "the information from several low energy points was combined .",
    "the two first columns of table 1 present the corresponding energy points ( intervals ) and integrated luminosities . the total integrated luminosity was @xmath14 .    the general purpose detector cmd-2 has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it consists of a drift chamber and proportional z - chamber , both used for the trigger , and both inside a thin ( 0.4 @xmath15 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1 t.    the barrel calorimeter placed outside the solenoid consists of 892 csi crystals of @xmath16 @xmath17 size and covers polar angles from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the energy resolution for photons is about 9% in the energy range from 50 to 600 mev .",
    "the end - cap calorimeter placed inside the solenoid consists of 680 bgo crystals of @xmath20 @xmath17 size and covers forward - backward polar angles from 16@xmath21 to 49@xmath21 and from 131@xmath21 to 164@xmath21 .",
    "the energy and angular resolution are equal to @xmath22 and @xmath23 radians respectively .",
    "the luminosity was determined from the detected @xmath24 events @xcite .    for the analysis of the reaction @xmath25  events with four charged tracks were selected .",
    "the tracks were required to originate from the interaction region :    * the impact parameter of the tracks @xmath26 is less than 0.3 cm * the vertex coordinate along the beam axis @xmath27 is within @xmath28 cm .    to have good reconstruction efficiency ,",
    "tracks were also required to cross at least two layers of the drift chamber : @xmath29 .    for the selected events the kinematic fit was performed assuming that all tracks are pions and under the constraint that the sum of the 3-momenta @xmath30 .",
    "further analysis was performed using the normalized `` apparent energy '' : @xmath31        figure [ fig : eapp - psi ] shows the distribution of @xmath32 versus the minimum space angle between the tracks with opposite charges @xmath33 . a narrow band with @xmath34 corresponding to @xmath3events is clearly observed in the region `` a '' . the region `` b '' is populated by events from the processes : @xmath35 and @xmath36 with the subsequent conversion of the photon into a @xmath37-pair at the beam pipe .",
    "events of the process @xmath38 , where the products of the nuclear interaction of the pions scatter back into the drift chamber and induce two `` extra '' tracks , fall in the region `` c '' . to suppress the background from this process , the condition @xmath39 was imposed where the parameter of the normalized maximum track momentum was defined as @xmath40    to reject the background from the reaction ( [ eq:3pi ] ) in the @xmath41 meson region where the number of observed events is small , the @xmath42-separation procedure from @xcite was employed .",
    "the idea of the method is the following . using reconstructed events of the processes @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the @xmath8 meson energy range ,",
    "the distributions in the parameter @xmath45 were studied for both particle types ( @xmath42 ) and signs ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "here @xmath47 is the energy deposition in the csi calorimeter and @xmath48 is the momentum of the particle with a track matching the cluster in csi .",
    "the probability density functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the parameter @xmath45 were determined for 50 mev bins of particle momenta ( 050 , 50100 etc . ) .",
    "then the probabilities were defined : @xmath51 for a track to be respectively pion or electron . in the same way the probability was defined : @xmath52 for the pair of tracks to be pions .",
    "figure  [ fig : epsep]a shows the distribution in the parameter @xmath53 for the events from the processes @xmath44 ( histogram ) and @xmath43 ( points with errors ) in the @xmath8 meson region . as is clear from this figure , the parameter @xmath53 efficiently separates events with @xmath37 pairs from those with @xmath54 pairs . in our analysis",
    "we calculated the parameter @xmath53 for two tracks with the smallest angle between them .",
    "figure  [ fig : epsep]b demonstrates the distribution in this parameter for the events from the region `` a '' ( in figure [ fig : eapp - psi ] ) which is dominated by @xmath3  events .",
    "we required @xmath55 to suppress the background from the process ( [ eq:3pi ] ) in the energy range 0.6 to 0.8 gev .",
    "the efficiency of this selection criterion was determined using the @xmath3  events in the energy range 0.81 to 0.97 gev .",
    "separation probability . a  distribution in @xmath53 for the events from the processes @xmath44 ( histogram ) and @xmath43 ( points with errors ) in the @xmath8 meson energy range ; b  distribution in @xmath53 calculated for two tracks with the smallest angle between them for the @xmath3  events ( region `` a '' ) .",

    "the remaining background from the reactions ( [ eq:3pi ] ) , ( [ eq : eeg ] ) and ( [ eq : ppg ] ) was estimated using the complete monte carlo simulation ( mc ) of the cmd-2 detector  @xcite and appeared to be negligible .",
    "for example , in the energy range 0.6 to 0.8 gev the expected number of events from the process ( [ eq:3pi ] ) is less than 0.2 to be compared to four events observed .    .",

    "black squares with error bars represent the experimental data while the shaded histogram is simulation of the process @xmath25 .",
    "good resolution in the parameter @xmath32 allows efficient separation even of the exotic final state @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution for it is shown by the transparent histogram obtained by the simulation of the process @xmath58 assuming the phase space kinematics of the final particles .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath60 was calculated at each energy using the formula : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of selected @xmath3  events , @xmath63 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath64 is the detection efficiency , and @xmath65 is the radiative correction at the @xmath66-th energy point .    the detection efficiency was determined from mc assuming four different quasi - twobody production mechanisms @xcite : @xmath11 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast to our observations at the energy above 1.05 gev @xcite , in the energy range studied in this experiment the effects of interference between amplitudes differing by permutations of identical pions make the difference between the models smaller .",
    "comparison of various invariant mass and angular distributions predicted by the model with experiment showed that @xmath68 and @xmath69 intermediate states can not well describe the data whereas @xmath11 and @xmath67 are almost indistinguishable in this energy range .",
    "for the final calculations the @xmath2 production mechanism which clearly dominates at higher energy @xcite has been chosen .",
    "the detection efficiency grows with energy varying from 17 to 28 % in the energy range 0.75 to 1.0 gev .",
    "it falls quickly below 0.7 gev since pion momenta become too small to reach the z - chamber and produce a trigger .",
    "radiative corrections were calculated according to @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : xsec ] gives the summary of the cross section calculations .",
    "since the number of selected events below 0.8 gev is small , the data from separate points were combined .",
    "the values of the cross sections or upper limits were obtained from the following formula : @xmath70 which takes into account the variation of the luminosity , detection efficiency and radiative correction over the energy interval and gives basically the correct average cross section .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows the energy dependence of the cross section below 1.05 gev .",
    "only statistical errors are shown . for illustration , also demonstrated in the figure are results from other measurements @xcite .",
    "the values of the cross section obtained in this work are consistent with them and match the measurements of cmd-2 above the @xmath8 meson .",
    "the systematic uncertainty comes from the following sources :    * selection criteria - 10 % * event reconstruction - 5 % * detection efficiency dependence on production mechanism - 3% * luminosity determination - 1.5 % * radiative corrections - 1 % .    the overall systematic uncertainty was estimated to be @xmath71 .",

    "energy range 0.652 gev .",
    "comparison of our data to the data of other groups .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves show separately the contribution of the @xmath4 and @xmath72 mesons respectively while the solid one is their sum taking into account the interference between them , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    .summary of the cross section calculations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the authors of a recent publication @xcite also describe the @xmath73 decay using the chiral lagrangian ( not including the @xmath74 meson ) and come to the value of @xmath75 close to that in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , they consider the cross section rapidly varying with energy as a more adequate characteristics of the process than the decay width and calculate the value of the cross section up to 0.9 gev . above 0.8",
    "gev their predictions for the cross section are well below the measured values .",
    "apparently , the chiral lagrangian approach fails to describe the dynamics of four - pion production already at these modest energies .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite ascribe the observed discrepancy to the fact that their model neglects higher derivatives and chiral loops .",
    "however , from the phenomenological point of view it is clear that the existence of the @xmath72 meson is essential for understanding the observed pattern while chiral theories fail to include excited states . in general , chiral theory seems to produce valid predictions at very low energies only .",
    "as already noted above , thorough analysis of the four pion production above 1.05 gev allowed to establish the @xmath11 dominance in @xmath37 annihilation @xcite and successfully describe a four pion decay mode of the @xmath76 lepton @xcite .",
    "we could also observe that the extrapolation of the model predictions to lower energies is in good agreement with the experiment even at energies as low as 0.8 gev .",
    "better understanding of this energy range could come after a bigger data sample is collected as well as determination of the cross section of the reaction @xmath77 and its combined analysis together with the reaction studied in this work .",
    "for the first time the cross section of the process @xmath1 has been measured in the c.m .  energy range 0.60 - 0.97 gev in which 153 events are observed .",
    "the cross section falls rapidly with the energy decrease and does not contradict the model in which final pions are produced via @xmath78 and @xmath72 mesons decaying into @xmath11 .",
    "the cross section value at the peak of the @xmath4 meson corresponds to the following value of its decay width @xmath79 and its branching ratio @xmath80 the measurement of the @xmath81 value at the energies below 1 gev known to give the dominant contribution to the hadronic part of the ( g-2)@xmath82 @xcite is one of the main goals of cmd-2",
    ". results of this work show that we can measure small cross sections even at the level of one tenth of nb and can thus provide the high precision determination of @xmath81 .",
