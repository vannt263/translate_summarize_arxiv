    "<S> it is at present an open question whether the polarization of quarks or antiquarks produced in hard collisions is observable via the final - state fragmentation products in the resulting jets . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 resonance is an ideal place to study this issue as the partons in @xmath2 decays are predicted by the standard model ( sm ) to be highly longitudinally polarized . </S>",
    "<S> if a method of observing such polarization were developed , it could be applied to jets produced in a variety of hard processes in order to elucidate the spin dynamics of the underlying interactions .    in the process </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 the relative cross sections for production of left- and right - handed quarks of flavor @xmath4 are given at tree level by @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the vector and axial - vector couplings of fermion @xmath4 to the @xmath1 , and @xmath11 is the polar angle of the outgoing quark with respect to the electron beam direction . </S>",
    "<S> the quark and antiquark in a @xmath1 decay have opposite helicities so that @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the sm predicts @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 so that the quarks are produced predominantly left - handed and the antiquarks predominantly right - handed . in order to observe a net polarization in an ensemble of jets from @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> decays it is therefore necessary to distinguish quark jets from antiquark jets .    </S>",
    "<S> this separation can be achieved at the slac linear collider ( slc ) where @xmath1 bosons are produced in collisions of highly longitudinally polarized electrons with unpolarized positrons . in 1993 </S>",
    "<S> the average electron beam polarization was 0.630@xmath160.011 @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the sm predicts a large difference in polar angle distributions between quarks and antiquarks , providing an unbiased separation of quark and antiquark jets . </S>",
    "<S> we define the `` helicity - based '' polarization of jets at a given @xmath17 : @xmath18 this jet polarization is independent of flavor , and reaches 0.72 and 0.52 in magnitude at large @xmath19 for beam polarizations of @xmath200.63 and @xmath210.63 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative variable is the `` chirality - based '' polarization of jets : @xmath22 this jet polarization is independent of @xmath23 and electron beam polarization but depends on quark flavor . it is accessible by charge ordering of the tracks used in the analysis as described below . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental challenge is to find observables sensitive to one or both of these expected jet polarizations .    </S>",
    "<S> nachtmann @xcite and efremov _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. @xcite have speculated that the polarization may be observable inclusively via a triple product of track momenta in jets . arguing that quark fragmentation may resemble a multi - body strong decay </S>",
    "<S> , they note that the simplest observable with the same transformation properties under parity inversion as @xmath24 ( eqn . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) has the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a unit vector along the jet axis , corresponding to the spin direction of a longitudinally polarized parton that produced the jet , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momenta of two particles in the jet chosen by some charge - independent prescription , e.g. , @xmath29 and referred to some suitable frame . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momenta of a positively and a negatively charged particle , the cross product can be ordered by charge , e.g. , @xmath30 for a given flavor @xmath31 has the same transformation properties under parity inversion as @xmath32 ( eq .  3 ) and </S>",
    "<S> so might be sensitive to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> jets from @xmath1 decays comprise a mixture of flavors that might yield different signals since quark charges and fragmentation properties depend on flavor . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account only the sign @xmath33 of the charge of quarks of flavor @xmath4 , one expects a net polarization @xmath34 , where @xmath350.17 and @xmath360.22 are the sm fractions of hadronic @xmath1 decays into @xmath37 or @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> although no quantitative estimate of the size of @xmath42 is given , it is argued in @xcite that such a term can arise from interference between two processes , for example fragmentation into @xmath43 and fragmentation into @xmath44 where @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath42 might be largest for triplets of pions nearby in rapidity in which a zero - charge pair has invariant mass near the @xmath46 mass , and the unpaired track together with the oppositely charged track in the pair is used to calculate @xmath42 in the 3-pion rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> it is also argued that evidence of polarization is more likely to be visible in the highest - momentum tracks in jets . </S>",
    "<S> ryskin has proposed @xcite an alternative physical model of the transport of parton polarization in the context of a string fragmentation scheme , which gives a nonzero expectation value of @xmath42 in the laboratory frame if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momenta of two hadrons containing partons from the same string breakup .    </S>",
    "<S> a jet may be defined as left- or right - handed if @xmath42 is negative or positive respectively . for an ensemble of jets </S>",
    "<S> the jet handedness @xmath47 is defined as the asymmetry in the number of left- and right - handed jets : @xmath48 it can then be asserted that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the expected polarization of the underlying partons in the ensemble of jets , and @xmath51 is the analyzing power of the method .    in this letter we present the results of the first search for jet handedness in @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> decays using a sample of approximately 50,000 hadronic @xmath1 decays collected by the sld experiment @xcite in 1993 . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the methods suggested in @xcite and @xcite , and have extended them to be more inclusive . for each method we used both helicity- and chirality - based definitions of @xmath42 to calculate @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> a handedness signal may be diluted in heavy flavor events , @xmath52 or @xmath41 , since a large fraction of the tracks in each jet is from the decay of a spinless heavy meson . </S>",
    "<S> dalitz _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ have concluded @xcite that any effect resulting from @xmath53 or @xmath54 decays should be very small . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore divided our data into samples enriched in light , @xmath55 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 , and heavy flavor events using hadron lifetime information , and sought evidence for jet handedness in each .    </S>",
    "<S> the trigger and initial selection of hadronic events is described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis presented here is based on charged tracks measured in the central drift chamber and vertex detector . </S>",
    "<S> a set of cuts was applied to select events well - contained within the detector acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> tracks were required to have ( i ) a closest approach to the beam axis within 5  cm and within 10 cm along the beam axis of the measured interaction point , ( ii ) a polar angle @xmath11 with respect to the beam axis with @xmath56 @xmath57 0.80 , and ( iii ) a minimum momentum transverse to this axis of @xmath58 @xmath59 150 mev/@xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> events were required to contain a minimum of five such tracks , a thrust @xcite axis polar angle with respect to the beam axis @xmath61 within @xmath62 @xmath57 0.71 , and a minimum charged visible energy @xmath63 gev , where all tracks were assigned the charged pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> events with hard gluon radiation were rejected by requiring events to contain only two jets , defined using the jade clustering algorithm @xcite at @xmath64 , which were back - to - back within @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> a data sample comprising 17,853 events passed these cuts .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to considering this global sample , events were classified as being of light or heavy flavor based on impact parameters of charged tracks measured in the vertex detector . </S>",
    "<S> the 9,977 events containing no track with normalized transverse impact parameter with respect to the interaction point @xmath66 were assigned to the light - flavor sample and all other events were assigned to the heavy - flavor sample . </S>",
    "<S> the light - flavor contents of these two samples were estimated from monte carlo simulations to be 84% and 30% respectively @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we first considered jets in which the three highest - momentum tracks had total charge @xmath161 and the invariant mass of each zero - charge pair satisfied @xmath67 gev/@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> all tracks were assigned the charged pion mass and their momenta were boosted into the three - track rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the tracks forming the higher - mass zero - charge pair were used to calculate @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the thrust axis signed so as to point along the jet direction . </S>",
    "<S> a signal would be visible as a nonzero mean @xmath42 , which in the case of the helicity - based analysis would be of opposite sign for events produced with positive and negative electron - beam polarization and for jets with positive and negative @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of sgn(@xmath74 and @xmath31 are shown for the light - flavor sample in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> both distributions appear to be symmetric about zero , implying that any jet handedness is small . also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 are the predictions of the jetset @xcite monte carlo simulation program for @xmath2 decays , in which spin transport was not simulated , combined with a simulation of the sld . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations give a good description of our measured inclusive track and event topology distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the means of the simulated @xmath42 distributions are consistent with zero within statistical errors , limiting any analysis bias to 0.008 on @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the variances of the measured distributions are reproduced by the simulation to within 5% relative , although the details of the shapes are not .    </S>",
    "<S> the jet handedness for the helicity - based analysis was calculated in bins of jet @xmath23 according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) separately for events produced with positive and negative electron - beam polarization . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown in fig .  2 for the light - flavor sample ; </S>",
    "<S> similar results ( not shown ) are obtained for the global and heavy - flavor samples . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the measured jet handeness is consistent with zero , and there is no evidence for an angular dependence . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( 7 ) was fitted simultaneously to the @xmath75 measured in events produced with positive and negative electron - beam polarizations , by averaging @xmath76 ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) over each @xmath23 bin and allowing the analyzing power @xmath51 to vary . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the fit to the light - flavor sample is shown as the solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 , and the fitted analyzing powers for all three samples are listed in table i.    the jet - handedness values for the chirality - based analysis were calculated from the unbinned @xmath31 distributions and the analyzing powers were calculated from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) , where @xmath77 ( eq .  3 ) was averaged over the flavor composition of each sample , estimated from the simulations and weighted by the sign of the quark charge . </S>",
    "<S> the analyzing powers are shown in table i. since all @xmath51 are consistent with zero , we set upper limits at the 95% confidence level on their magnitudes , also shown in table i.    since the helicities of the quark and antiquark in a given event are opposite , one might expect a correlation between @xmath42 values in the two jets in an event , which would be negative for the helicity - based analysis and positive for the chirality - based analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we found correlation coefficients to be consistent with zero , within statistical errors of @xmath160.02 , for both analyses and for the global , light- , and heavy - flavor samples .    </S>",
    "<S> we extended this method to use the @xmath78 highest - momentum particles in each jet , with @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> we considered all zero charge pairs @xmath80,@xmath81 among these @xmath78 particles , without imposing mass cuts , and calculated @xmath82 and @xmath83 for each pair in the @xmath78-particle rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> jets with fewer than @xmath78 tracks were excluded . </S>",
    "<S> we then considered both the average , @xmath84 , and the @xmath85 with largest magnitude @xmath86 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the jet handedness calculated from the global , light- and heavy - flavor samples was consistent with zero for all @xmath78 and for both helicity- and chirality - based analyses . for @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> upper limits on the magnitudes of the analyzing powers in the range 0.05 - 0.11 were derived . for </S>",
    "<S> larger @xmath78 the reduced sample size limits our accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we then attempted to select pairs of tracks likely to contain partons from the same string breakup . in studies using jetset </S>",
    "<S> we found the relative rapidity with respect to the jet axis of the tracks in a pair to be useful for this . requiring zero charge </S>",
    "<S> does not improve this selection , but was used in the chirality - based analysis .    in each jet the tracks </S>",
    "<S> were ordered in rapidity and assigned a number @xmath88 , where @xmath89 for the track with highest rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> we then required pairs of tracks @xmath80,@xmath81 to have @xmath90 and max(@xmath91,@xmath92)@xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> since the signal is expected @xcite to increase with momentum @xmath94 transverse to the thrust axis , we also required @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated @xmath83 and @xmath82 in the laboratory frame for each pair satisfying these criteria and then considered both the average , @xmath84 , and the @xmath85 with largest magnitude @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> we varied @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 in an attempt to maximize the handedness signal . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the jet handedness calculated from the global , light- and heavy - flavor samples was consistent with zero . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained upper limits in the range 0.05 - 0.11 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath1012 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> statistics become poor in the potentially interesting high-@xmath98 region .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of systematic checks was performed . </S>",
    "<S> the results of all analysis methods were found to be insensitive to the track and event selection cuts , to the jet - finding algorithm and @xmath102 values used to select 2-jet events , and to the values of the selection criteria for tracks used to define @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> each analysis was performed on samples of monte carlo events in which spin transport was not simulated , yielding @xmath47 consistent with zero within @xmath103 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have searched for evidence of parton polarization in hadronic @xmath1 decays using the jet handedness methods proposed in @xcite and @xcite . in an attempt to optimize a signal we studied a wide range of parameters for each method . in each case </S>",
    "<S> we applied both helicity- and chirality - based analyses , and sought signals separately in samples of light- and heavy - flavor jets as well as in the global sample . </S>",
    "<S> we found no evidence for a non - zero jet handedness , implying that the transport of polarization through the quark fragmentation process is small . </S>",
    "<S> the method proposed in @xcite , applied to a sample of light - flavor jets , yielded upper limits of 0.099 and 0.070 on the magnitudes of the analyzing powers of helicity- and chirality - based analyses respectively . </S>",
