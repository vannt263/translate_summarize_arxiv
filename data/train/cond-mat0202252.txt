    "it has been controversial how neurons communicate information by spikes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "much of debates on the nature of the neural code has been mainly focused on the two issues .",
    "the first issue is whether information is encoded in the average firing rate of neurons ( _ rate code _ ) or in the precise firing times ( _ temporal code _ ) .",
    "andrian @xcite first noted the relationship between neural firing rate and stimulus intensity , which forms the basis of the rate code . actually firing activities of motor and sensory neurons",
    "are reported to vary in response to applied stimuli . in recent years , however , the alternative temporal code has been proposed in which detailed spike timings are assume to play an important role in information transmission : information is encoded in interspike intervals ( isis ) or in relative timings between firing times of spikes @xcite-@xcite . indeed , experimental evidences have accumulated in the last several years , indicating a use of the temporal coding in neural systems @xcite-@xcite . human visual systems , for example ,",
    "have shown to classify patterns within 250 ms despite the fact that at least ten synaptic stages are involved from retina to the temporal brain @xcite .",
    "the transmission times between two successive stages of synaptic transmission are suggested to be no more than 10 ms on the average .",
    "this period is too short to allow rates to be determined accurately .",
    "the second issue is whether information is encoded in the activity of single ( or very few ) neurons or that of a large number of neurons ( _ population _ or _",
    "ensemble code _ ) .",
    "the population rate code model assumes that information is coded in the relative firing rates of ensemble neurons , and has been adopted in the most of the theoretical analysis @xcite . on the contrary , in the population temporal code model",
    ", it is assumed that relative timings between spikes in ensemble neurons may be used as an encoding mechanism for perceptional processing @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a number of experimental data supporting this code have been reported in recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , data have demonstrated that temporally coordinated spikes can systematically signal sensory object feature , even in the absence of changes in firing rate of the spikes @xcite .",
    "the strong criticism against the temporal code is that spikes are vulnerable to noise while the rate code performs robustly in the presence of noise but with limited information capacity .",
    "it is well known that although firings of single neocortical neurons in _ vitro _",
    "are precise and reliable , those in _",
    "vivo _ are quite unreliable @xcite .",
    "this is due to noisy environment in _ viro _ , which makes the reliability of neurons firings worse . in recent years , however , much studies have been made for the stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite@xcite in which information transmission of signals is enhanced by background noises , against our conventional wisdom .",
    "sr in a neural system has been theoretically investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the transmission fidelity for weak external signals , which is evaluated by the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or the peak height of the interspike - interval ( isi ) distribution , is enhanced by added noises .",
    "sr is supported in some physiological experiments for biological systems such as crayfish @xcite@xcite , cricket @xcite and rat @xcite@xcite .",
    "although sr itself is a genetic phenomenon , its detailed character is determined by the three important factors : ( a ) kinds of systems ( neurons ) , ( b ) input signal and ( c ) noises .",
    "as for the first factor of ( a ) neurons , sr in single neurons has been studied by using various theoretical models such as the integrate - and - fire ( if ) model @xcite-@xcite , the fitzhough - nagumo ( fn ) model @xcite-@xcite and the hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model @xcite@xcite .",
    "sr in coupled or ensemble neurons has been also investigated by using the if model @xcite-@xcite , fn model @xcite-@xcite and hh model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the transmission fidelity has maximum when the noise magnitude or the coupling strength is changed .",
    "it has been pointed out that the transmission fidelity of ensemble neurons for sinusoidal inputs with independent white noises is improved as the size of an ensemble is increased @xcite .    as for the second factor of ( b ) input signals , most of theoretical studies",
    "have been made for analog inputs with periodic ( mostly sinusoidal ) or aperiodic amplitude modulation @xcite .",
    "this is because these studies have been motivated by a fact that peripheral sensory neurons play a role of transducers receiving analog stimulus and emitting spikes .",
    "in central neural systems , however , cortical neurons are reported to play a role of data - processors receiving and transmitting spike trains @xcite .",
    "there are only a few theoretical studies on sr for spike - train inputs @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the response of single if neurons to coherent spike - train ( st ) inputs is shown to be enhanced by an addition of weak st noises characterized by the poisson @xcite @xcite or gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the present author has studied sr of ensemble hh neurons for _ transient _ spike - train inputs with independent gaussian noise by using the wavelet analysis @xcite .    as for the third factor of ( c ) noises , it has been reported that noises are ubiquitous in neural systems .",
    "the origin of these noises is not clear at the moment .",
    "we may suppose , however , several conceivable origins of noises : ( i ) cells in sensory neurons are exposed to noises arising from the outer world , ( ii ) ion channels of the membrane of neurons are known to be stochastic @xcite , ( iii ) the synaptic transmission yields noises originating from random fluctuations of the synaptic vesicle release rate @xcite , and ( iv ) synaptic inputs include leaked currents from neighboring neurons @xcite .",
    "most of existing studies on sr have simulated noises of the items ( i)-(iii ) by the gaussian white noise @xcite-@xcite @xcite-@xcite@xcite or orstein - uhrenbeck ( ou ) noise @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "st noise is employed in refs.@xcite-@xcite taking account the item ( iv ) . in our study",
    ", we will include the st and white noises which may be regarded , in a crude sense , as analog and digital noises , respectively , with the rather different character .",
    "one of the controversial issues concerning cortical neurons is how the neurons may communicate information by spikes with a large variability .",
    "it has been reported that the variability of @xmath9 is observed in spike trains of non - bursting cortical neurons in visual v1 and mt of monkey @xcite , which is in strong contrast with a small @xmath10 in motor neurons @xcite .",
    "there have been much discussions how to understand the observed large variability : a balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs @xcite , the high physiological gain in the plot of input current vs. output frequency @xcite , correlation fluctuations in recurrent networks @xcite , the active dendrite conductance @xcite , input isis with the distribution of a slow - decreasing tail @xcite , and input isis with large @xmath11 @xcite@xcite .",
    "we expect that although there might be several origins responsible to the observed , large variability in isi , noises may be one of conceivable mechanisms .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate responses of ensemble neurons to _ spike - train _ inputs subject to st and white noises , in order to get some insight to the following issues .",
    "\\(1 ) is the effect of st noise on responses to spike - train signals , particalrly on sr , different from or same as that of white noise ?",
    "\\(2 ) is a population or ensemble of neurons important for the fidelity of signal transmission ?",
    "\\(3 ) is a large variability of spikes compatible with information transmission with a fairly good snr ?",
    "responses of single hh neurons to various types of spike - train inputs with deterministic , chaotic and stochastic isis without noises , have been investigated @xcite .",
    "sr for coherent spike - train inputs has been theoretically studied with single if neurons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that the response to applied , external stimulus of the realistic hh model @xcite is rather different even qualitatively from that of the if neuron @xcite@xcite .",
    "for an excitatory dc input @xmath12 , the if neuron which is classified as the type i , evokes the self - excited oscillation showing the continuous @xmath13 relation with a wide range of frequency @xmath14 . on the other hand , the hh neuron ,",
    "which is classified as the type ii , has the discontinuous @xmath13 relation at the critical current , above which it shows the oscillation with a fairy narrow range of @xmath14 . for an inhibitory dc input current",
    ", the hh neuron can fire with the so - called rebound process while the if neuron can not . since the threshold - crossing behavior of the neuron is important in determining the behavior of its sr , it is necessary to re - examine sr for the spike - train inputs with the use of the realistic hh neuron model .",
    "furthermore , since sr of single neurons is generally different from that of ensemble neurons , it is also necessary to investigate sr not only of single hh neurons but also of ensemble hh neurons .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , an adopted model for an ensemble of @xmath0-unit ( @xmath0 = 1 , 10 , 100 ) hh neurons is described .",

    "the third term @xmath43 in eq.(1 ) denotes added , independent noises which consist of two terms : @xmath44 the first term of eq.(6 ) expresses poisson st noise , whose magnitude , @xmath45 , is hereafter expressed by @xmath46 in terms of @xmath47 as in eq.(3 ) for a later purpose , and @xmath48 is the @xmath35-th firing time of the st noise of the neuron @xmath49 with the average isi of @xmath50 .",

    "we should remark that our ensemble neuron model given by eqs.(1)-(6 ) does not include synaptic couplings among constituent hh neurons , in contrast with the coupled ensemble models @xcite@xcite@xcite ; related discussions being given in sec .",

    "so far our discussion is confined to the sub - threshold case .",
    "we have performed simulations also for the supra - threshold inputs , adopting @xmath40 larger than the threshold value of @xmath88 .",
    "figure 6 shows the @xmath122 dependence of snr calculated for st noise only ( @xmath123 and @xmath100 ) with @xmath93 ms , and @xmath98 , 10 and 100 .",
    "when @xmath122 is increased across the threshold value of @xmath88 , snr is discontinuously increased .",
    "snr for the supra - threshold inputs is better than that for sub - threshold inputs , as expected .",
    "we note , however , that ensemble neurons with large @xmath0 is fairly robust against weak noises relevant to sr .",
    "next we discuss the distribution of output isis of _ individual _ neurons given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the @xmath64-th firing time of outputs of the neuron @xmath49 .",
    "figures 7(a)-(d ) show histograms of output isis for @xmath40=0.02 , 0.06 , 0.10 and 0.14 , respectively , when st noise of @xmath91 is added to st signal ( see fig . 6 ) . in the cases of @xmath126 , isi histograms ( isih )",
    "nearly obey the exponential distribution as shown by dashed curve , but it vanishes at @xmath127 ms because a hh neuron can not properly respond to small - isi inputs due to its refractory period @xcite . on the contrary , in the cases of @xmath128 and 0.14 , isih has larger magnitudes at @xmath129 , which may be approximately expressed by the gamma - type distribution . in the case of @xmath130 ,",
    "isih includes not only the truncated exponential distribution but also finite contributions at multiples of @xmath95 .",

    "both @xmath131 and @xmath132 are almost constant at @xmath133 , and at @xmath134 they are suddenly decreased .",
    "when isih of output spikes for @xmath87 is expressed by the truncated exponential distribution given by @xmath135 @xmath136 being the heaviside function and @xmath137 the lower bound , the average and rms values are given by @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which yield @xmath140 and @xmath141 ms for @xmath142 and @xmath143 ms .",
    "these figures are a little different from @xmath144 and @xmath145 ms for @xmath146 shown in fig .",

    "6 and fig . 8 , we note that even if the variability of isis of individual neurons is considerable , output signals summed over a large - scale ensemble [ @xmath94 in eq.(10 ) ] may carry information with a fairly good snr .",

    "iii , the simulation time of each run has been limited to be 1500 ms ( 150000 @xmath83 time steps ) because of a limitation in our computer facility .",
    "it is , however , possible , to extend the simulation time when the simulation is made only for single ( @xmath98 ) neurons .",
    "figure 14 shows snr as a function of @xmath101 for st noise added to single hh neurons , which are calculated with the simulations times of @xmath171 1500 , 3000 , 6000 and 12 000 ms , yielding ft - data sizes ( @xmath84 ) of 512 , 1024 , 2048 and 4096 , respectively .",
    "we note that as @xmath86 becomes larger , snr is improved , in particular , its maximum becomes more evident .",
    "the dashed curve expresses snr calculated by using eq.(12 ) with @xmath109 and a set of parameters of @xmath172 = ( 3 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) , which are chosen to reproduce snr calculated for @xmath175 ms with the maximum at @xmath176 . again",
    "the index of @xmath6 is realized for st noise added to single neurons .",
    "we note from figs . 4 and 14",
    "that sr becomes more significant if the duration of applied , coherent spike trains is longer and/or the size of ensemble neurons is larger .",
    "even if the duration of applied signal is not long , snr may be improved if the size of ensemble neurons is sufficiently large .",
    "this is more evident when the input signal is _ transient _ spike train , as recently demonstrated in ref.[54 ] .    in a summary",
    ", we have numerically investigated sr responses of an ensemble of hh neurons to spike - train signals with added st and/or white noises .",
    "our conclusions against the three issues raised in the introduction are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) comparisons of figs . 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 for st noise with figs . 9 ,",
    "10 , 11 and 12 for white noise , respectively , clearly show both the difference and the similarity between the effects of st and white noises .",
    "although sr is a genetic phenomenon , its detailed behavior depends on kinds of the input signal and added noises . when analyzing snr obtained in our simulations with the use of eq.(12 ) , we get @xmath6 for st noise , which is different from @xmath7 for white noise .",
    "st noise is less effective for sr than the white noise ( fig .",
    "\\(2 ) snr is more improved as the size of ensemble is larger . in a large neuron ensemble ,",
    "the transmission fidelity for supra - threshold inputs is not significantly degraded by weak noises responsible to sr for sub - threshold inputs ( figs . 6 and 10 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the variability of isis of individual neurons for sub - threshold inputs is rather large ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "nevertheless the output @xmath178 summed over an ensemble may carry information with a fairly good snr .",
    "the item ( 2 ) is consistent with the results of sr for transient spike - train signal @xcite and for analog signals @xcite , showing that a population of neurons plays a very important role for the transmission of spike - train inputs both with sub- and supra - threshold levels .",
    "it is worth to note that this enhancement in snr is due to the _ pooling effect _",
    "@xcite because our ensemble neuron model have no couplings among hh neurons .",
    "the item ( 3 ) shows that noise may be one of conceivable mechanism yielding a large variability observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "even when the variability of firings of individual neurons is considerable , firings summed over a ensemble may carry information with a fairly good snr enhanced by sr and pooling effects .",
    "thus the large variability and high snr are not incompatible in a large - scale neuron ensemble .",
    "the present study entirely relies on simulations .",
    "it would be interesting to theoretically elucidate the dependence of the index @xmath5 on a kind of added noises mentioned above .",
    "however , conventional approaches having been employed for a study of sr such as the rate - equation and linear - response theories @xcite-@xcite , do not work on our case .",
