    "in 1922 alexander friedmann @xcite first noted the existence of ` periodic worlds ' in his solutions of einstein s equations for isotropic and homogeneous universes with positive spatial curvature .",
    "but the physical study of cyclic universes in general relativistic cosmology begins with the work of tolman @xcite , who first considered the simple situation of a closed friedmann universe with zero cosmological constant , @xmath0 , and non - negative pressure .",
    "the evolution of tolman s cyclic universes can be continued periodically through the big crunch singularity if it is assumed that no new physics arises there and the evolution can be extended smoothly through it . , to the density ,",
    "@xmath1 , required an additional assumption . to avoid a finite - time ( ` sudden ' ) singularity occuring where @xmath2 with finite @xmath1 before the expansion maximum is reached one must stipulate some control over @xmath3 for example @xmath4 for constant @xmath5 @xcite . ] as a next step , tolman incorporated the general consequences of an increase of entropy from cycle to cycle , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this produced a monotonic increase in the maximum size and length of successive cycles , which continues forever .",
    "if this entropy increase is modelled as an increase in the dimensionless entropy per baryon in a mixture of radiation and baryons ( ignoring baryon non - conserving interactions ) then the increase is a reflection of the asymmetry in the pressure , @xmath6 , from cycle to cycle , as energy is transferred from the baryonic ( @xmath7 ) to the radiation ( @xmath8 ) gas .",
    "tolman s work attracted periodic interest by other astronomers like bonnor @xcite and zanstra @xcite in the 1950s , before zeldovich and novikov turned tolman s result into a theorem for rather restrictive equations of state of matter obeying friedmann s equations and the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "they also assumed that the cycles could not be continued indefinitely into the past because they would become smaller than the smallest finite - sized elementary particles ( not assumed pointlike in those days ) .",
    "as the cycles continue to increase in size , an oscillating universe appears increasingly ` flat ' , although it is closed with positive spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "this might even provide an explanation for the proximity of the expansion dynamics to flatness today that differs in detail from that of the standard one - cycle inflationary universe model ( although the latter generates proximity to flatness by a large entropy increase in one cycle through ` reheating ' rather than by a progressive build up over many cycles by all processes ) .",
    "however , in what follows we will show that it does not share other features of an inflationary universe at late times .",
    "generalisations of this simple oscillatory tolman universe produced some interesting new features .",
    "barrow and dabrowski @xcite show that if there is a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath9 ) then the sequence of growing oscillations always comes to an end after a finite proper time and the dynamics evolve towards an ever - expanding de sitter asymptote as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this end to the oscillations occurs no matter how small the positive value of the cosmological constant is : the cycles grow until they inevitably produce one that is large enough for the @xmath11 term to eventually dominate the dynamics at large size and its effect is to stop a further contraction from occurring .",
    "notice that the final state is always one which is close to flatness and only just ( depending on the exact size of the inter - cycle entropy jump ) dominated by the @xmath0 energy density  rather like our universe , in fact .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in section sec : isotropic_bounces by presenting some simple exact solutions with finite minima that illustrate the usefulness of introducing ghost fields into any model of bouncing universes . in section [ sec : the_model ]",
    "we describe the thermodynamic aspects of the evolution . in section sec :",
    "numerics we give diagonal bianchi type ix metric and field equations and present some simple approximate parametric solutions for the case of the radiation - dominated axisymmetric type ix universe , as well as a solution for the purely cosmological constant dominated axisymmetric type ix universe ( a case which falls outside the encompass of the cosmic no - hair theorems ) .",
    "these will serve to guide our interpretation of the numerical solutions of the full dynamical equations . in the next section we present the results of numerically solving the full bianchi type ix equations , first during a single cycle without the ghost field , then with the ghost field over many cycles .",
    "we study cases with and without the injection of radiation entropy .",
    "finally , we study the same problems with the addition of positive or negative cosmological constants .",
    "the assumption of a ` bounce ' occurring at zero expansion scale and infinite density is computationally ( and physically ) awkward",
    ". however it can be improved upon by introducing a simple ` ghost ' field , with negative density , @xmath12 , that will cause the expansion to go through a smooth minimum at the beginning and at the end of each cycle instead of through a singularity where @xmath13 . as illustrations ,",
    "we can find two simple exact solutions which are of use in more complicated situations .",
    "suppose that we have a closed friedmann universe with scale factor , @xmath14 , containing two ` fluids ' having densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the second ` ghost ' fluid with negative density , @xmath17 , acts as a model stress to dominate at small @xmath18 and effect a bounce at @xmath19 , while the conventional fluid with positive density , @xmath1 , dominates at larger @xmath20 .",
    "this situation continues to exist until the spatial curvature creates an expansion maximum at @xmath21 we give two solutions which are useful models of this type of behaviour for more detailed analyses and illustrate the effects of the two fields :    \\a . _ ghost fluid with _ @xmath22 _ _  and conventional radiation fluid with _ _",
    "@xmath23    the friedmann equation ( setting @xmath24 ) is    @xmath25    with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being constants .",

    "limit @xmath36 we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 and we see that the maxima grow and the minima decrease in size if we let the radiation entropy grow from cycle to cycle .",
    "ghost fluid with @xmath39 and conventional dust fluid with @xmath40    the friedmann equation is    @xmath41    and , if @xmath42 a new exact solution can be written simply in conformal time @xmath29 in terms of the expansion maximum and minimum radii as @xcite    @xmath43 \\ , \\ ] ]    where    @xmath44 , \\\\ ] ]    @xmath45 .\\ ] ]    in the limit that @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so if we introduce an increase in matter entropy ( @xmath49 ) from cycle to cycle then we will have successively increasing maxima and decreasing minima .",
    "in what follows , we shall add a ghost field to an oscillating anisotropic , spatially homogeneous universe in order to produce a smooth bounce at finite values of the scale factor where the densities are non - singular .",
    "it would be possible to effect a smooth bounce with a scalar field with quadratic potential which has been investigated in mixmaster universes @xcite , however the probability of this bounce occurring is small , @xmath50 , in any universe with @xmath51 .",
    "all of the above discussion has focussed upon simple isotropic closed universes with @xmath52 spatial topology .",
    "the situation in simple anisotropic universes of kantowski - sachs type was studied in detail by barrow and dabrowski @xcite and produces a more complicated scenario for cycle to cycle evolution .",
    "the kantowski - sachs universes have special @xmath53 spatial topology and are far from generic even amongst homogeneous anisotropic universes , although they have inhomogeneous generalisations with no symmetries found by szekeres @xcite . only closed ( compact space sections ) universes with @xmath54 or @xmath52 topologies possess maximal hypersurfaces and so can recollapse and bounce when gravitationally attractive matter is present @xcite . whether or not they will do so depends on the matter content of the universe .    in this paper we will study the dynamics of a cyclic bianchi type ix ` mixmaster ' universe with @xmath52 spatial topology .",
    "this is the most general spatially homogeneous anisotropic closed universe and it contains the closed friedmann universe as an isotropic special case .",
    "exact solutions are only known for the axisymmetric special cases in vacuum , containing stiff matter ( @xmath55 ) or electromagnetic fields , or a combination of both .",
    "we are particularly interested in the behaviour of these anisotropic universes on approach to an expansion maximum of the volume and the behaviour of the three expansion scale factors there .",
    "do the cycles grow in maximum size and do they become increasingly anisotropic from cycle to cycle ? we will confine our attention to the case where the fluid in the universe is comoving , although in a subsequent study we will generalise this to fluids with non - comoving velocities .",
    "the type ix universe behaves quite differently to the simple bianchi type i anisotropic universe because it has both expansion anisotropy ( shear ) and 3-curvature anisotropy .",
    "the 3-curvature anisotropy has no newtonian analogue .",
    "the 3-curvature dynamics are complicated and the sign of the 3-curvature varies in time and is only positive when the expansion dynamics are sufficiently close to isotropy . an expansion maximum will only occur when the 3-curvature , @xmath56 , becomes positive ( as it is all the time in the closed friedmann universes ) .",
    "we want to discover if increasing entropy increases the size of successive expansion maxima , as in the cyclic friedmann models , but also determine what happens to the expansion anisotropy over successive cycles .",
    "we can also incorporate a positive or negative cosmological constant to see if it can terminate a sequence of oscillations in a cyclic type ix universe in the same way that it does in an isotropic closed universe .    in order to follow the bianchi type ix evolution smoothly from cycle to cycle ,",
    "we introduce a stiff ghost field to create an expansion minimum at non - zero volume in every cycle , as discussed above .",
    "this field has no significant effect on the expansion maxima or the behaviour of the dynamics in its vicinity .",
    "it is well known that the bianchi ix model displays formal chaotic behaviour in all its degrees of freedom as the volume tends to zero @xcite .",
    "however , there is only an unbounded number of chaotic oscillations of the scale factor on an open interval @xmath57 around the time origin for finite @xmath58 : an infinite number of scale factor oscillations occur on any such interval no matter how small the value of @xmath58 . in any finite interval @xmath59",
    "not including @xmath60 , the number of oscillations is finite and not technically chaotic . for realistic choices of @xmath61 for the start of classical cosmology , there will be less than about @xmath62 mixmaster oscillations even if they continued all the way from @xmath63 up to the present day @xcite .",
    "this is because the overall expansion scale changes rapidly with the number of scale factor oscillations , which occur in logarithmic time .",
    "thus , if there is a bounce at @xmath64 volume the issue of chaotic mixmaster oscillations @xcite is irrelevant to a discussion of the long - term dynamics .",
    "some bouncing cosmologies deal with the situation at bounce by incorporating a so - called phase of ekpyrosis where there is effectively an ultra stiff isotropic fluid with a @xmath65 field added to the matter content of the universe @xcite .",
    "if there are no anisotropic pressures , this drives the dynamics towards isotropy as a singularity is approached .",
    "however , we should expect anisotropic pressures to be larger than the energy density ( as is assumed for the isotropic pressure ) , due to the dominance of collisionless particles when @xmath66 .",
    "the presence of these anisotropic pressures during the phase of ekpyrosis can reinstate the distorting effects of anisotropies and they diverge on approach to the bounce @xcite .    in this work , we shall consider the effect of expansion and curvature anisotropies on a model of a bouncing type ix universe .",
    "this model incorporates several bounces , and we increase the entropy of the constituent matter content via an injection at each bounce .",
    "the increased entropy in each bounce leads to a higher maxima and longer cycles , as found in the original analysis of tolman .",
    "the claim is that with increasing maxima , simple isotropic bouncing models , such as the isotropic friedmann universe approaches flatness and begins to resemble the present - day universe in this respect .",
    "we shall investigate this claim in more general circumstances .",
    "we confirm the increasing volume maxima in successive bounces and the eventual cessation of bounces in the presence of a cosmological constant but , with a more complicated transitional evolution for the isotropisation of the three scale factors .",
    "however , we find that in the absence of a cosmological constant successive cycles become increasingly anisotropic despite the increase in size and approach to flatness .",
    "this is quite different to the long - term evolution predicted by inflation .",
    "we also investigate the effects of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this always produces collapse to a future singularity @xcite .",
    "our aim in doing this is to construct an anisotropic version of the simple friedmann universes which can all be transformed into simple harmonic oscillators in conformal time after rescaling the expansion scale factor @xcite .",
    "these models are studied as a further simple example of a bouncing type ix universe .",
    "they include ` domain - wall ' matter ( @xmath67 ) , as well as a negative cosmological constant in a closed friedmann universe .",
    "we can also include an ultra - stiff matter field with isotropic pressures ( @xmath68 ) to subdue the anisotropies on approach to the bounce . in the absence of pressure anisotropies , this should work and allow our model to propagate further without hitting a singularity . in a later study",
    "we will include both non - comoving velocities and associated pressure anisotropies into the analysis of cyclic type ix universes .",
    "our next task is to follow the consequences of a growth of entropy in the constituents of the system .",
    "the definition of a cosmological entropy is still debated . here",
    ", we shall use only the thermodynamic entropy of the radiation or matter content and ignore any contribution from a ` gravitational entropy ' that might be associated with weyl curvature , gravitational clustering , or the area of the particle horizon @xcite .",
    "we will use a very simple toy model of entropy injection in our model of a bouncing universe .",
    "we are , in this analysis , not interested in the physical origin of the production of entropy by non - equilibrium processes like quantum particle production or viscous anisotropy damping , which are dramatic entropy producers as @xmath69 , @xcite .",
    "rather , we will consider sudden entropy increase at each expansion minimum and also use the dependence of the size of the expansion maximum on the entropy to determine the effect of increasing the entropy in a cycle . to circumvent issues regarding the non - conservation of baryon number , and hence making the definition of entropy per baryon ambiguous",
    ", we shall consider the effects of an increase of entropy of radiation . to model this , we consider first the definition of the entropy of radiation , @xmath70 , which is given by , @xmath71where @xmath58 is the temperature at that instant and @xmath72 is the volume of the universe .",
    "we assume that the entropy per unit volume , once injected at the minima , remains constant throughout the duration of the cycle until the next minimum ( we ignore all particle - antiparticle annihilations and massive particles that become non - relativistic ) .",
    "the radiation energy density varies as @xmath73 .",
    "hence , during each cycle , the quantity @xmath74 is a constant , implying that @xmath75 .",
    "so , we can write the entropy as @xmath76thus , we can assess the effect of increasing the entropy of radiation by an increase in the constant @xmath77 .",
    "it has been shown previously , in works such as @xcite , that an increase in the entropy of radiation leads to an increase in the expansion maxima in closed friedmann universes . _ _  _ _ we expect this to occur also for a bianchi ix universe .",
    "however , we also wish to study how the shape of the anisotropy behaves as the cycles get bigger with entropy injection . for this",
    "we need to specify the form of the type ix metric and analyze the field equations .",
    "we aim to study the effects of entropy growth in anisotropic oscillating models of bianchi type ix .",
    "we divide the problem into several sub - cases .",
    "we are interested in discovering whether the present - day universe would isotropise and approach flatness in a bouncing universe model after many cycles of entropy growth . in all cases , we take our cosmological  model to be the spatially homogeneous bianchi type ix spacetime containing radiation with pressure @xmath78 and  a ` dust ' matter field with equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "we use the radiation field to assess the effects of increasing the entropy of radiation from cycle to cycle in a bouncing universe .",
    "if only these two fluids are present , the universe will evolve towards a strong curvature singularity and experience only one cycle unless we assume a periodic continuation through the singularity .",
    "if we add the ultra - stiff ghost field with @xmath79 then we create a smooth non - singular bounce and can follow the evolution through several cycles .",
    "we can then introduce a growth of entropy in the radiation field in the vicinity of the bounce in order to study the long - term effects of the shear anisotropy and the @xmath80-curvature on the expansion maximum . in the last section of the paper ,",
    "we introduce a positive cosmological constant and also a negative cosmological constant , to see how the evolution is changed by their presence . in the latter case",
    ", we will add a domain- wall fluid ( @xmath81 ) and an ultra - stiff fluid ( @xmath68 ) to facilitate smooth non - singular bounces .",
    "note that when a ghost field is added to create a non - singular bounce it means that the dynamics will be dominated by this isotropic matter field at the expansion minima and so it will have a small isotropising effect over small time intervals around the minima .",
    "however , it is outweighed by the lengthening of the evolution time produced by the growing size of successive maxima .",
    "it would be possible to effect non - singular bounces with an anisotropic ghost field but this complication has been avoided here .",

    "typically , the 3-curvature is _ negative _ as long as the dynamics are significantly anisotropic ( @xmath163 for axisymmetric [ metric ] when @xmath164 ) .",

    "thus , by injecting radiation entropy , and effectively increasing the expansion maxima , we give the shear anisotropy more time to increase in the contracting phase , and thus , more time to dilute in the expanding phase . hence , despite the increase in the shear anisotropy , we still see the universe recollapse and bounce .",
    "we can also compare the pattern of entropy growth in the anisotropic bianchi ix case with its isotropic subcase , the closed friedmann universe .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : volentropybianchi ] for the case of the bianchi ix universe and in figure [ fig : volentropyfrw ] for the case of the isotropic closed friedmann universe , that the variation of successive volume scale factor maxima in the friedmann and the type ix universes with increasing radiation entropy show very similar , almost linear behaviour ( this would be different if we injected entropy according to a different rule ) .",

    "h    it should come as no surprise that the range is also increasing fairly linearly with the injection of entropy as can be seen in figure fig : rangeentropybianchiix .",
    "the increase in volume maxima , simply means that the model takes a longer time to recollapse .",
    "we have seen in previous work and that the addition of cosmological constant to the closed friedmann model which incorporates increasing volume maxima with the injection of radiation entropy , results in the model ceasing to oscillate before expanding exponentially towards the de sitter metric bdab .",
    "now we study the effects of adding both a positive or a negative cosmological constant in type ix universes .",
    "the motivation for doing this , for the case of the positive cosmological constant , is to see if a similar exponential expansion to the isotropic case takes place .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the effect the expansion prompted by the cosmological constant has on the anisotropy and the spatial 3-curvature .",
    "the negative cosmological constant models create an interesting anisotropically recollapsing counterpart to the closed friedmann models .",
    "these models are among the simplest versions of a closed isotropic bouncing universe as they incorporate a negative cosmological constant as well as a curvature ` field ' which behaves as a fluid with equation of state @xmath187 .",
    "they admit a simple periodic solution in the isotropic case .",
    "it is expected that when anisotropy is included , in the absence of an ultra stiff matter field , the universe will quickly approach an anisotropic singularity since the negative @xmath0 term is only influential at large volumes to effect a collapse but has negligible effect as the future singularity is reached .",
    "we study the effect of adding a positive cosmological constant to a type ix model containing radiation with entropy injection , a dust field , and the ultra - stiff ( @xmath68 ) ghost field to ensure a smooth non - singular bounce .",
    "the results depend on the value of the cosmological constant relative to the initial energy densities of the other fields . if the cosmological constant",
    "is set to have a value of the same order of magnitude as the other components in the system ,",
    "then the model displays a very sudden increase in all the scale factors in each of the three directions without any of the oscillating behaviour that we have seen in the other cases : it quickly asymptotes to de sitter behaviour . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cosmological constant is too small then its effects can not be seen in the time interval that we have set for integration .",
    "thus , for an intermediate range of values of the cosmological constant , we find that as soon as the cosmological constant starts to dominate , the volume scale factor which was hitherto showing an oscillatory behaviour with increasing maxima from cycle to cycle , does not recollapse beyond the point of maxima .",

    "we found that the entropy increase leads to steady increase in the size of the volume maxima of successive cycles and to their temporal duration but these maxima are anisotropic .",

    "oscillations of the universe occur , and grow anisotropically as in the case of @xmath202 until the size of the maximum grows large enough for @xmath0 to become dynamically important there .",
    "subsequently , after a few scale factor transitory changes it will dominate before any expansion maximum can occur and accelerate the expansion towards an increasingly de sitter - like metric evolution .",
    "this behaviour is in accord with cosmic no - hair theorems even though , technically , they do not apply to the type ix metric because it permits positive three - curvature , which is excluded by the theorems      the addition of a negative cosmological constant causes any cosmological model to recollapse , regardless of the sign of the 3-curvature .",
    "we use the addition of @xmath203 to produce a simple bouncing model that experiences a finite non - singular minimum at the end of each cycle because of the presence of a ghost field .",
    "we follow the chaotic evolution of the scale factors , the shear , and the 3-curvature from cycle to cycle .",
    "we showed that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "our analysis introduced some simplifying assumptions .",
    "we consider only the diagonal bianchi ix metric with fluids that possess comoving velocity fields and isotropic pressures . in a separate study",
    ", we will relax these assumptions and show that a similar analysis is possible which leads to similar conclusions .",
    "thus we have shown that in the most general spatially homogeneous anisotropic cyclic universes in general relativity with @xmath204 the growth of entropy leads to never - ending cycles of increasing size and duration , as tolman first showed for isotropic models . however , although these cycles approach flatness they do not approach isotropy and do not resemble our observed universe . if we add @xmath9 then , no matter how small the magnitude of @xmath0 , the growing oscillations always come to an end and subsequently the dynamics pass through a quasi - isotropic phases before asymptoting towards the isotropic dynamics of a de sitter metric .",
