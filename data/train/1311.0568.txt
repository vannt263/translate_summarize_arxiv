    "electromagnetic fields are the main tool in the control and manipulation of the motion of polarizable dipoles , such as atoms and molecules , which are key objects in physics and chemistry .",
    "optical traps @xcite and laser cooling @xcite are widely used to induce external mechanical forces on individual dipoles , whereas interactions between atoms are often tuned with the help of external magnetic or electric fields @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we address laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions ( liddi ) by establishing their relation to resonant inter - dipolar interaction ( excitation exchange ) in any confined geometry .",
    "polarizable dipoles subject to static electric fields interact via the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction that scales in free space as @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the inter - dipolar distance .",
    "a dynamic analog is obtained when a laser field , far - detuned from the dipolar resonant frequency , illuminates the ( induced ) dipoles . in the retarded regime ,",
    "where @xmath2 with @xmath3 the laser wavenumber , the resulting liddi scales like @xmath4 , whereas in the non - retarded quasistatic case , where @xmath5 , the electrostatic scaling @xmath0 is restored @xcite .",
    "the retarded long - range liddi was shown to be associated with peculiar many - body effects , such as self trapping @xcite , density modulations @xcite and the existence of a roton - like collective excitations @xcite , in an atomic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "recently , the possibility to control and shape the space - dependence of the inter - dipolar liddi potential was considered .",
    "one option is to tune the laser parameters @xcite or the radiation spectrum @xcite .",
    "another , more recent approach , is to consider dipoles coupled to structures that support confined photon modes @xcite . once illuminated by off - resonant light and virtually excited , these dipoles interact via confined virtual photons whose spatial - mode structure determines the resulting liddi space - dependence .",
    "for example , in the case of many atoms that are trapped in the vicinity of an optical fiber @xcite and free to move along its axis as in @xcite , the fiber - mediated liddi can effectively become one - dimensional ( 1d ) , such that it extends to any range and the atoms may self - organize @xcite .",
    "when the fiber incorporates a bragg grating ( 1d photonic crystal ) , the relaxation dynamics of the resulting many - atom system was shown to reveal the inequivalence of statistical ensembles typical of non - additive systems @xcite .",
    "self organization and dynamics of laser - illuminated atoms inside a cavity were also studied theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "a similar situation arises when considering the spatial dependence of the dispersive interaction between the internal degrees of freedom of the dipoles , the so - called resonant dipole - dipole interaction ( rddi ) , where a dipole , e.g. an atom initially in the excited state , periodically exchanges its excitation with another dipole , e.g. an atom initially in the ground state @xcite .",
    "rddi is mediated by the exchange of virtual photons between the atoms , hence its space - dependence is determined by the spatial structure / propagation of the mediating photon modes . in free space and for @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the typical dipolar transition wavelength , the rddi exchange frequency scales as @xmath0 whereas in the retarded regime @xmath8 it takes the form @xmath9 .",
    "such rddi retardation effects are of interest for quantum information processing @xcite",
    ". studies of geometries where rddi is mediated by confined photon modes include , for example , rddi via surface - plasmon - polariton and coplanar waveguide modes in one dimension @xcite or in geometries that create cutoffs or bandgaps in the photonic mode spectrum @xcite , where spontaneous emission is absent and enhanced long - range rddi may become dominant @xcite .    the extensive experimental progress in the ability to couple atoms / dipoles to various confined photonic structures @xcite , makes the discussion of liddi in such structures ever more relevant . in this study",
    "we derive a general formalism for liddi in _ any geometry _ by relating it to the underlying rddi process , thus providing a simple and intuitive recipe for calculating liddi through the less complex rddi .",
    "we also show that the same holds for the relation between scattering of laser photons and spontaneous emission , respectively .",
    "our formalism has several appealing features : ( 1 ) it is fully quantum mechanical , with the laser radiation taken to be in a coherent state ( in contrast to the less realistic number state @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) it interprets _ liddi as rddi between dressed dipoles _",
    ", thus allowing to account for liddi in strong radiation fields .",
    "this considerably simplifies the calculation of liddi in a general geometry to merely calculating the rddi in that geometry , thereby avoiding the need for the rather cumbersome fourth - order perturbative qed calculation which contains 24 diagrams @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) it enables the analysis of _ nonlinear effects _ in liddi , resulting from the nonlinear response of the dipoles to the laser , unaccounted for previously .",
    "( 4 ) for the case of far - detuned laser field , it reveals a simple relation between the pairwise rddi energy @xmath10 and the liddi potential @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the laser rabi frequency and @xmath13 the dipole - laser detuning .",
    "this provides an intuitive picture for liddi : the dipole / atom is virtually excited by the off - resonant laser with probability @xmath14 and , once excited , interacts with the other dipole / atom via rddi .",
    "the paper is organized as the following .",

    "<S> polarizable dipoles , such as atoms , molecules or nanoparticles , subject to laser radiation , may attract or repel each other . we derive a general formalism in which such laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions ( liddi ) in any geometry and for any laser strength are described in terms of the resonant dipole - dipole interaction ( rddi ) between dipoles dressed by the laser . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a simple route towards the analysis of liddi in a general geometry . </S>",
    "<S> our general results reveal liddi effects due to nonlinear dipolar response to the laser , previously unaccounted for . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these nonlinear effects is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> our general formalism is illustrated for liddi between atoms in a cavity . </S>"
