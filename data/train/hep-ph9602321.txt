    "it has been understood recently that at sufficiently large @xmath1 diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons is calculable in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the necessary conditions are : i ) @xmath2 should be much larger than the radius of the target so that the photon transforms predominantly into a quark component well before the target ; ii ) high @xmath1 is a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee small interquark distances in the quark component of the wave function of the projectile photon , and thus enables the applicability of the assumption of asymptotic freedom ; iii ) the initial photon should be longitudinally polarized to ensure the smallness of the produced quark configuration when it arrives at the target .",
    "another potentially fruitful handle to guarantee the smallness of the interquark distances in the wave function of the photon is the large mass of the heavy quark ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "m.ryskin  @xcite suggested that the large mass of the @xmath4 quark is a sufficient condition for the applicability of @xmath5 for the production of @xmath4 quarks in the with a proton target and to ensure the applicability of the charmonium model to describe the light ",

    "when the momentum transferred to the target- @xmath7 tends to zero , the cross section for the hard diffractive electroproduction of @xmath8 through the interaction of a longitudinally polarized photon with a target proton at sufficiently large @xmath1 has the form in @xmath0  @xcite : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the @xmath11 of the virtual photon , @xmath12 is the current mass of the produced heavy quark @xmath4 and @xmath13 is the decay width of the vector meson into a @xmath14 pair .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 is the minimal fock component of the light ",
    "cone wave function of the vector meson with mass @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is a @xmath1 dependent function to be discussed below .",
    "we want to stress that cross sections of hard diffractive processes as well as any hard processes can be simply expressed through the distribution of bare quarks and gluons but not through the distribution of constituent quarks .",
    "the factor @xmath19 is the gluon distribution in the proton target . within the leading @xmath20 approximations",
    "there is ambiguity in the dependence of parton distributions on the virtuality @xmath1 . to draw attention to this important point",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath21 .",
    "m. ryskin suggested  @xcite to use @xmath22 .",
    "another intuitive suggestion is to compare parton distributions for the different processes at the same transverse distances between quarks in the wave function of the photon  @xcite . for moderate @xmath1",
    "the second suggestion predicts a somewhat less steep increase of the cross section with decreasing @xmath23 . in principle due to the difference between the photon `` mass '' and the mass of the vector meson",
    ", nondiagonal gluon distributions should enter into the formulae  @xcite .",
    "but at sufficiently small @xmath23 it should coincide with the diagonal gluon distributions .",
    "this has been proven by the direct calculations within the leading @xmath24 approximation in  @xcite .",
    "a more general proof will be given elsewhere . by definition ,",
    "the factor @xmath18 includes nonasymptotic effects related to the photon and the vector meson wave functions .",
    "when @xmath7 is different from 0 , the vertex for the transition @xmath25 should depend rather weakly on the momentum transferred to the target and should be almost universal for all hard diffractive processes  @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath26 the slope of the differential cross section @xmath27 , we may estimate its value at large @xmath1 as @xmath28 . here",
    "r is the radius of the gluon distribution in the target proton .",
    "taking r=0.6fm from the realistic quark - gluon models of a nucleon we obtain @xmath29 3gev@xmath30 . at @xmath31",
    "the photon-@xmath6 vertex leads to an additional contribution to @xmath26 of @xmath32 gev@xmath33  @xcite .",
    "thus a natural estimate for the slope of hard diffractive photoproduction of @xmath6 is @xmath34 gev@xmath30 . with increasing @xmath1",
    "the slope b should decrease to the value around @xmath35 gev@xmath33 .",
    "the cross section of diffractive photo - and electroproduction of @xmath8 mesons has been evaluated by ryskin  @xcite in terms of the bfkl approximation and nonrelativistic constituent quark charmonium model for the @xmath8 meson .",

    "@xcite used the leading @xmath36 approximation to evaluate the cross section of the electroproduction of longitudinally polarized vector mesons in terms of the minimal fock component of the light - cone wave function of vector mesons . in  @xcite",
    "this process has been evaluated within the leading @xmath37 approximation of @xmath0 and effects of the quark fermi motion were taken into account . in this case",
    "conventional leading order gluon and quark distributions enter , and not asymptotical gluon distributions as in  @xcite and/or in  @xcite .    within the approximation which assumes that the minimal fock component of the light - cone wave function of the @xmath6 can be approximated by the wave function of a nonrelativistic charmonium model  @xcite the production of transversely polarized @xmath6",
    "can be recalculated through the cross section of longitudinally polarized @xmath6 .",

    "we are indebted to z. chan for pointing this out .",
    "] at the same time at large @xmath1 the wave functions of all mesons should approach the universal wave function @xmath38  @xcite and the charmonium model approximation would be in variance with @xmath0 .",
    "( here @xmath39 is the fraction of the momentum of the vector meson carried by the quark ) .",
    "the effects of the quark fermi motion within this model are given by the factor @xmath40 , @xmath41 the substitution @xmath42 is necessary to transform diagrams of light cone perturbation theory for the wave function of @xmath6 into nonrelativistic diagrams for the wave function of @xmath6 in charmonium models .",
    "the factor @xmath43 is included in the definition of the nonrelativistic charmonium wave function to keep the phase volume to be the same as within the nonrelativistic approach . here",
    "@xmath44 is the laplace operator in transverse momentum space which acts on the photon wave function .    in  @xcite realistic charmonium wave functions calculated from a power - law  @xcite and a logarithmic potential  @xcite",
    "were used .",
    "both functions describe @xmath45 reasonably well .",
    "the evaluation leads to the factor @xmath46 . the significant suppression of the cross section at moderate @xmath1 is caused by the fact that for the realistic charmonium model wave functions the integral over the quark momenta is slowly convergent at large quark momenta .",
    "to visualize the estimate of @xmath47 we decompose it into powers of @xmath48 : @xmath49 . here by definition @xmath50 .",
    "( note that for the coulomb potential- which follows from qcd for the sufficiently large mass of heavy flavor @xmath51 .",
    "so this decomposition is inapplicable for the production of sufficiently heavy flavors where applicability of @xmath5 is most reliable . )",
    "the coefficient @xmath4 has been evaluated in  @xcite as @xmath52 and in  @xcite as @xmath53 .",
    "this difference is due to the leading and next to leading powers of @xmath54 in the evaluation of the operator @xmath44 both of which are taken into account in  @xcite but not in  @xcite . for the numerical estimates",
    "ryskin et al .",
    "@xcite used a gaussian type approximation to the wave function of the @xmath6 and suggested @xmath55 . within this approximation @xmath56 for @xmath52  @xcite and @xmath57 for @xmath53  @xcite",
    "the numerical approximations leading to the difference between the calculations of  @xcite and of  @xcite are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this problem deserves further investigation .",
    "if the dependence of the interquark potential on the mass of the quark ( on the running coupling constant , on the running quark mass etc ) can be neglected , the cross section would be @xmath58 . within the range of constituent quark masses between @xmath59 gev which are explored in the realistic charmonium models , and at the same time not far from the bare mass of the @xmath4 quark the cross section changes within @xmath60 .",
    "calculations within the realistic charmonium models produce weaker dependence on @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "for the production of vector mesons with @xmath61 by longitudinally polarized photons , all dependence on the quark masses and thus on flavor is contained in the light - cone wave functions of the vector mesons only .",
    "color exchange is flavor blind and it is legitimate to neglect the masses of current quarks in the hard scattering amplitude .",
    "@xmath62 predicts that at sufficiently large @xmath1 the ratio of the production cross section for charmed mesons to that of the @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "the production of @xmath8 should be additionally enhanced at large @xmath1 by the larger probability for a smaller object to annihilate into small object .",
    "experimentally , this ratio is suppressed at small @xmath1 as compared to the prediction of @xmath62 symmetry by a factor of @xmath65 . such a suppression",
    "is naturally explained within the above discussed model and it should slowly disappear with increasing @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "thus qcd predicts a dramatic increase of the @xmath66 ratios at large @xmath1  @xcite .    at very large @xmath67",
    ", the @xmath68 wave functions of all mesons should converge to a universal asymptotic wave function  @xcite . in this limit",
    ", further enhancement of heavy flavor production is expected leading to @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the factor @xmath18 discussed above shows that the observation of the full restoration of the predictions of @xmath62 symmetry for the @xmath8meson production would require extremly high values of @xmath1 .",
    "the presently published results of the hera experiments on diffractively produced @xmath8 is for @xmath1 = 0  @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results in the electroproduction region ( @xmath70 gev@xmath33 ) have been presented by h1 at the eps meeting in brussels  @xcite .",
    "12.0 cm    a compilation of the photoproduction cross section for the reaction @xmath71 as function of the @xmath72 center of mass energy @xmath73 is presented in figure 1 .",
    "one can see a fast increase of the cross section with @xmath73 , approximately like @xmath74 . note that this increase is also seen in the hera data alone , thus independent of possible relative normalizations between the low and high energy experiments .",
    "such a fast increase of the cross section with @xmath73 is unexpected within the non  perturbative two  gluon exchange of donnachie and landshoff  @xcite , which predict a rise like @xmath75 after taking shrinkage into account .",
    "the rise is consistent with a model calculated within leading @xmath76 approximation which connects the rise to the behaviour of the gluon density with decreasing @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary data from the electroproduction of @xmath8  @xcite indicate that the @xmath1 dependence is steeper than that expected from gvdm .",
    "however there are two qcd effects , which tend to slow down the dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "one effect is that the gluon density increases with @xmath1 at small @xmath23 .",
    "numerically , the factor @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath78 with @xmath79 . in addition",
    "a _ preasymptotic _",
    "effect comes from the factor @xmath18 of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . the combination of these two effects results in a relatively slow decrease with @xmath1 as compared to @xmath80 .",
    "this could be checked once higher statistics data are available .",
    "to summarize , the investigation of exclusive diffractive processes appears to be an effective method to measure the minimal fock state @xmath68 component of the light - cone wave functions of vector mesons as well as the light - cone wave functions of any small mass hadron system having angular momentum one .",
