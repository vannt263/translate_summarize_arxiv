    "amphiphilic molecules are generally composed of a polar , hydrophilic ( i.e. `` water - loving '' ) head and at least one hydrophobic ( i.e. , `` fat - loving '' ) tail , typically a carbon chain . the presence of these two ingredients , in combination with an aqueous solvent , yields a large variety of self - assembled structures on different length scales , ranging from molecular - size micelles to mesoscopic membranes , bicontinuous foams and lamellar phases . from an application point of view , amphiphiles are used in a variety of contexts , e.g. , to reduce the surface tension in complex mixtures ( such as water and oil ) , as templates to create nanoporous materials @xcite and , more recently , to stabilize bundle and network formation in solutions of carbon nanotubes @xcite .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the self - assembly of amphiphilic molecules has been investigated by a variety of approaches and models @xcite , including lattice gas systems @xcite , ginzburg - landau theory @xcite , density functional studies of entropic models ( where the surfactant is represented by a sphere plus an infinitely thin rod @xcite , or by a dimer @xcite ) , and off - lattice simulations @xcite of flexible bead - spring molecules @xcite , with and without explicit solvent .",
    "a particularly simple , implicit - solvent model has been proposed by tarazona _",
    "et al . _ already in 1995 @xcite .",
    "within this model , the amphiphilic particle is a sphere composed of two hemispheres , one being hydrophilic and the other one hydrophobic .",
    "the solvent - mediated interaction is then taken into account via an effective directional potential involving the orientation vectors defined by the symmetry axis of the spheres . despite these simplifications ( which completely neglect geometrical factors such as relative size of the head group etc . ) , the model is capable of describing bilayer- , vesicle- , and micelle formation . from todays perspective , one would call this simplified amphiphilic molecules rather as `` janus spheres '' .",

    "since then , and as anticipated by p.  g. de gennes on the occasion , of his nobel lecture @xcite , the surface properties of these janus particles have become an area of great interest on their own . generally , janus particles are composed of at least two physically ( or chemically ) distinctive surfaces , and there has been significant progress to synthesize such particles @xcite ( whose interactions can also be , e.g. , dipolar or magnetic in character @xcite ) . theoretically there are several models `` on the market '' which are similar in character to that proposed by tarazona _",

    "therefore , we focus on density distributions with the symmetry suggested by the planar wall and assume translational symmetry in the other spatial dimensions . as a consequence , the orientational distribution also simplifies to @xmath75 .    having this in mind , it is useful to introduce various @xmath73-dependent orientational order parameters .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath76 and @xmath77 the function @xmath78 describes the `` polarization ''",

[ eta03 ] ) .",
    "hence , we mainly consider the @xmath73-dependent `` polarization '' , @xmath84 .",

    "the limit @xmath87 corresponds to a pure hs system .",

    "the appearance of such membranes was already shown in the original paper of tarazona _ et al .",

    "this initial profile quickly disappears during the iteration procedure . for low values of @xmath88 ,",
    "on the other hand , the procedure yields indeed formation of periodically repeated bilayer structures , characterized by a sharp decay of the density outside of the bilayers , and a depletion zone between the membranes .",
    "the temperatures separating both regions are indicated by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ bulk ] .",
    ".,width=302 ]    however , the precise location of this line has to be considered with some caution since the inhomogeneous low - temperature profile did not converge to a truly stable result .",
    "therefore , we should consider the line in fig .  [ bulk ]",
    "rather as an upper limit of the temperature range related to membrane formation .",
    "we also note that our results differ from those obtained in ref .  , where the transition temperatures were found to be higher ( the focus in @xcite was on lower densities , though )",
    ". these deviations might be due to the fact that the hs part of the density functional used in ref .",
    "was treated in weighted - density approximation , rather than by fmt as in the present study .",
    "we also note that the present functional does not predict a gas - liquid transition of the janus - particle system , as it was found , e.g. , in a recent simulation study of a related model system consisting of patchy janus particles @xcite . within our study",
    ", the absence of condensation is a consequence of the mean - field treatment of the anisotropic interactions ; indeed , the corresponding term in the density functional [ see last term on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) ] is zero in a fully disordered system . interestingly ,",
    "if we focus on such a homogeneous , isotropic system and use a _ modified _ mean field approximation ( mmft ) for the anisotropic part ( for applications of the mmft to related systems , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we do find a gas - liquid phase transition , indicating that the janus interaction is _ effectively attractive_. the corresponding phase coexistence points are indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "here we do not explore this aspect further , the main reason being that the use of mmft in the presence of surfaces ( which are the focus of our study ) would have implied a drastic increase of numerical effort . in the following discussion of surface effects ( on the basis of the pure mean - field approximation )",

    "contrary the neutral - wall case , however , the second density maximum at the hydrophilic wall is much smaller than the first .",
    "we understand this behavior as a consequence of the fact that , in the second layer , the hydrophilic orientation preferred by the wall competes with that dictated by the fluid - fluid - interaction ; the latter rather favors the hydrophobic side orienting towards the wall .",

    "one observes the typical oscillatory density and orientation profiles , indicating the tendency for bilayer formation consisting of oppositely oriented janus particles",

    ", one expects the structure at either surface to become decoupled from that at the other surface , yielding bulk like - behavior ( i.e. , @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) in between the two walls .",

    "decreasing the temperature we observe layer formation ( which is typical for any confined system ) , accompanied by the development of orientational order particularly close to the walls .",
    "at the wall separation considered , the  polarization  at low temperatures is asymmetric in the sense that particles in the left contact layer point antiparallel to those in the right contact layer .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the low - temperature system consists of seven layers , a structure which allows for three full bilayer structures ( composed of oppositely oriented particles as discussed in sec .",
    "[ neutral_walls ] ) plus one single layer .",

[ lz_35](a ) ] . upon lowering the temperature ,",
    "the anisotropic fluid - fluid interactions yields a splitting of the middle peak , reflecting that particles in the middle layer tend to arrange in a  buckled  structure where neighboring particles are somewhat shifted to each other with respect to the @xmath73-direction . the corresponding orientation profile in fig .",
    "[ lz_35](b ) reveals that , in this buckled middle layer , the particles arrange in an antiparallel way .",
    "note that the resulting in - plane arrangement is not particularly unfavorable , since according to our model , side - by - side configurations are energetically  neutral ",
    "( see fig .  [ model ] ) . by assuming this rather complex structure the system at @xmath123 overcomes frustration effects .",
    "even stronger confinement , as it is the case at @xmath124 ( see fig .",
    "[ lz_3 ] ) , then yields three pronounced layers of particles , with the contact layers pointing in opposite direction .",
    "however , contrary to the situation at @xmath123 , the order parameter directly at the position of the middle layer is zero . only slightly left or right of the center one finds a preferred janus - like orientation",
    "we therefore regard this case as a frustrated system .",
    "the different microscopic configurations appearing in the strongly confined systems in dependence of @xmath117 give rise to pronounced oscillations of the normal pressure @xmath127 [ as calculated from the contact theorem , see eq .",
    "( [ contact_theorem_hw ] ) ] .",
    "the importance of this quantity stems from the fact that it is experimentally accessible , e.g. , by colloidal - probe atomic force microscopy @xcite .",

    "[ pressure_slit ] .",
    ", width=302 ]    as it is typical for confined , dense systems of spherical particles , the oscillations have a period of about one particle diameter .",
    "compared to the high - temperature situation , the anisotropic interactions not only strongly enhance the amplitude of the oscillations ; they also lead to slightly asymmetric peak shapes and to a shift of the oscillations .",
    "indeed , at low temperatures , the maxima of @xmath128 occur at multiples of the particle diameter , consistent with the previously discussed frustration effects , e.g. , at @xmath124 . on the other hand ,",
    "the complex structure seen , e.g. , at @xmath123 , corresponds to a minimum of the normal pressure curve .",
    "in this paper we have used classical density functional theory to explore the structure formation of amphiphilic janus particles at planar surfaces .",
    "our density functional approach involves a sophisticated ( fmt ) treatment of the repulsive ( hs ) interactions , whereas the anisotropic interactions are treated on a mean - field level .",
    "one key finding of our study is that , due to the presence of a surface , significant translational and orientational ordering related to bilayer formation occurs under conditions where the bulk system is still homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "thus , the surfaces seem to strongly support the structure formation , even when this surface is just a neutral ( hard ) wall .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the details of the inhomogeneous structure at the wall can be  tuned  by varying the surface potential . indeed , walls preferring the hydrophilic part tend to enhance the bilayer structure seen already at neutral walls , whereas hydrophobic walls typically induce a competition between mono- and bilayer structures .",
    "we note that the degree of hydrophobicity can be experimentally tuned , e.g. , by coating silicon wafers with polymer films of varying thickness @xcite . finally , we have considered confinement effects emerging from the presence of two planar ( neutral ) surfaces .",
    "it turns out that , for specific wall separations , there are pronounced frustration effects stemming from the interplay between the fluid - surface potential , which prefers planar layering , and the fluid - fluid potential preferring bilayers with depletion areas in between .",
    "this competition is also visible in an experimentally accessible quantity , that is , the normal pressure as function of wall separation .",
    "clearly , the present study is only a starting point for a more systematic investigation of the impact of surfaces on the self - assembly of amphiphilic janus particles . from a physical point of view ,",
    "one main drawback of our calculations is the restriction to planar , self - assembled geometries . especially at low densities",
    "one would also expect the occurrence of spherical structures such as vesicles and micelles ; the most  stable \" structure could then be selected by comparison of the related free energies . furthermore , in experiments of elongated amphiphilic molecules ( rather than amphiphilic spheres ) at surfaces , both planar and spherical structures are observed @xcite , suggesting that different structures could also occur for the spherical ( janus ) case .",
    "the strategy to include spherical self - assembled structures within our density functional approach is generally clear , as shown by tarazona _",
    "@xcite in their study of bulk systems .",
    "however , considering such spherical structures in combination with surfaces will require significant additional computational effort due to the further reduction of symmetry .",
    "another open point is the presence of a vapor - liquid transition in the system .",
    "although the present mean - field approach ( where the anisotropic contribution to the functional cancels out in a homogeneous , isotropic state ) does not reveal any condensation transition in the bulk , our preliminary results from a modified mean - field approach ( see fig .  [ bulk ] ) indicate that there is , at least , a strong tendency for condensation .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement to what has been found in another recent study @xcite of janus systems ( where , notably , the bulk condensation transition is accompanied by micellization ) . in the context of surface systems ,",
    "a bulk condensation transition could have important consequences , since it would enable a wetting transition ( on top of the structures already observed ) .",
    "therefore , it would be very interesting to improve the present density functional approach for the surface systems beyond the mean - field level . finally , a further interesting issue concerns the impact of curvature of the substrate on the self - assembled structures @xcite .",
