    "the random energy model ( rem ) introduced by derrida @xcite-@xcite is one of the fundamental models of modern physics .",
    "originally derived as a mean - field version of spin - glass models , it has subsequently been applied to describe some features of 2-d liouville models @xcite,@xcite , as well as the properties of quenched disorder in d - dimensional space with a logarithmic correlation function of energy disorder .",
    "the logarithmic correlation is easy to organize both for models on a hierarchic tree and in 2-d .",
    "the rem structure in the d - dimensional logarithmic correlation case has been proved in @xcite using bramsons results @xcite . in @xcite,@xcite a rem - like model in 1-d space has been solved directly , using the generalization of selberg integrals @xcite .",
    "a mapping has been used in @xcite to map the rem onto strings .",
    "a rem can be formulated not only for the case of normal distributions of energies , which corresponds to the logarithmic correlation function of energies on a hierarchic tree , similar to logarithmic correlation functions in d - dimensional disorder case @xcite , but also for general distribution of energies @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is an open problem to find solvable models with the non - logarithmic correlation for energy disorder in 1-d space . to describe the fluctuations in financial market ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have constructed some dynamical models , the markov switching multi - fractal models ( msm ) .",
    "the msm has time translational symmetry , contrary to cascade models , defined on hierarchic trees @xcite .",
    "the connection of the 1-d rem model @xcite with the multi - fractal random walk model @xcite-@xcite was found in @xcite . in this article",
    "we will prove that the dynamical models of @xcite and @xcite provide a 1-d rem where the correlation function for energies ( @xmath0 in our case ) has a general character instead of being logarithmic .",
    "let us give the definition of the msm model , following @xcite . in the msm model ,",
    "one considers the sequence of variables @xmath1 , where @xmath2 describes a discrete moment of time : @xmath3 @xmath4 has a normal distribution , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined at the moment t of time via a product of k components @xmath7 @xmath8 the variables @xmath7 are random variables with some distribution .",
    "every moment of time our random variables are replaced with new ones with a probability @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 are parameters of the model .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 plays the role of the branching number in cascade models ( models of random variables on the branches of hierarchic models ) and @xmath12 is the maximal number of hierarchy on the tree .",
    "an important difference is that now @xmath11 is a real number , while in case of hierarchic trees b should be an integer .",
    "later we will formulate the continuous branching version of the model with a single relevant parameter @xmath13 defined from the equation @xmath14 we will use the notation @xmath15 in sections ii - h , iii - b while investigating the multi - scaling properties of the model .",
    "the model is named as `` random walk '' model , because , due do eq.(1 ) , it is equivalent to the random walks with an amplitude @xmath16 , when the time itself is a random variable see @xcite and @xcite for a simple proof . the random variables @xmath7 are described via a markov process , as any time period the transition probability depends only on the current state .",
    "there is a switching according to eq.(4 ) , that s why the authors of @xcite define it as a `` switching '' model .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 is chosen to ensure the constraint @xmath17 where @xmath18 means an average .",
    "we can take the log - normal distribution for @xmath7 or normal distribution for @xmath19 , defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is similar to the inverse temperature in statistical physics .",

    "the previous expression is derived by observing that @xmath6 and @xmath27 have identical @xmath7 for @xmath28 levels of hierarchy .",
    "the probability that @xmath7 and @xmath29 are identical is @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath7 and @xmath29 are identical for l - th level of hierarchy defined through the inequality @xmath31 for the rest of the hierarchy levels @xmath7 and @xmath29 are different .    when @xmath32 the majority of the hierarchies have the same @xmath7 and @xmath29 .",
    "alternatively , when @xmath33 @xmath34 for the the majority of l.    in section iii we derive some more rigorous results .",

    "we choose the distribution @xmath37 with some shift @xmath38 to ensure the constraint given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) : @xmath39 thus we take @xmath40 where @xmath12 is our parameter describing the maximal hierarchy level .",
    "hence , we have the following expression for the correlation function : @xmath41      let us define a partition function @xmath42 where @xmath43 is chosen from the distribution given by eq.(15 ) .    considering eq.(1 ) as a dynamic process for a large period of time m",

    "we define @xmath49 where @xmath50 are defined through the distribution @xmath48 and the corresponding free energy is @xmath51 eqs.(22 ) and ( 23 ) define a statistical physics model with @xmath52 configurations and special quenched disorder in 1-d space .",
