    "the concept of a strong electric field producing electron positron pairs from the vacuum , usually called schwinger pair production , was first discussed by sauter in 1931 @xcite . since then it has been studied in detail in more complicated field configurations .",
    "different methods were developed including those that are exact on the mean - field level e.g. the quantum kinetic theory ( qkt ) @xcite and the real - time dirac  heisenberg  wigner ( dhw ) formalism @xcite . using a scattering ansatz it is still possible to find exact results , but the ansatz is often combined with a semiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "this combination is sometimes referred to as wentzel ",
    "kramers  brillouin ( wkb ) approach @xcite or even as wkb approximation @xcite , while only the ansatz , but not the approximation , is taken from the original wkb method .",
    "we will thus not refer to the method discussed here as wkb method , but as semiclassical scattering method .",
    "other semiclassical methods include the worldline instanton method @xcite .    in semiclassical calculations simple field configurations result in pair creation rates which are the same up to a factor of 2 in scalar and spinor qed respectively .",
    "however if there is more than one pair of classical turning points , interference effects arise which lead to differing results @xcite .    the first extensions of sauter s original work concentrated on one - component electric fields .",
    "in addition to one - component fields depending on either space @xcite or time , exact solutions can be found in lightcone variables @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a connection between these three special cases was found using interpolating coordinates and the worldline instanton method .",
    "recently also more involved fields have been studied including electric fields with two or three components depending on space @xcite and fields depending on space as well as on time @xcite . in the presence of very strong fields",
    "qed cascades of successive radiation of accelerated charges and particle production from hard photons are expected to occur @xcite and a lot of the research in this area concentrates on rotating fields .",
    "a lot of interest is put upon field configurations that could be found in counterpropagating lasers , this includes ( nonlinear ) breit  wheeler pair production @xcite and pair production in pure electric fields near the antinodes of the magnetic field @xcite .    the leading semiclassical order ( often referred to as exponential factor ) of schwinger pair production for constant rotating fields",
    "has been studied using the scattering method in @xcite and using the worldline instanton method in @xcite .",
    "this was extended to include the next order ( often referred to as prefactor ) in @xcite for the scattering method and in @xcite in interpolating coordinates for the worldline instanton method .",
    "pair production for a pulsed rotating field has first been studied in @xcite using a method based upon the dirac  heisenberg  wigner formalism , which we will call the wigner function method or , in short , the wigner method . for generalizations to elliptically",
    "polarized fields see @xcite .    in the current work",
    "we compare the results of the semiclassical scattering method and the wigner method of @xcite and @xcite respectively for rotating electric field pulses of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 defines the shape of the pulse . for a fair comparison ,",
    "we mostly stay in the semiclassical regime .",
    "in contrast to the case of a constant rotating pulse , it is difficult to find an analytical solution for general @xmath1 in the semiclassical scattering approach .",
    "we thus propose two different ways to proceed .",
    "the first is to carry out the necessary computation numerically , the second is to perform an additional approximation which uses the analytic results for the constant rotating field .",
    "we will refer to the latter one as locally constant rotating field approximation ( lcrfa ) .    comparing the numerical methods we find that they are complementary with respect to computation time as well as with respect to computational accuracy .",
    "the lcrfa is computationally much faster , behaves qualitatively like the numerical methods and is a good approximation for long enough pulses .",
    "additionally we find that the two independent solutions found for the scattering method can be connected to a linear combination of spinor states with specific chirality and magnetic moment . with this knowledge we succeed in reproducing these two independent solutions using the wigner method .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in the first three sections we briefly introduce the methods which are compared later . in section [ sec : wigner ] we review the wigner method and present a method to project the wigner function onto specific spinor states .",
    "the results of the scattering method for two - component electric fields are derived directly from the dirac equation in section [ sec : semiclass ] .",
    "the new lcrfa for rotating electric fields is introduced in section [ sec : approx ] . in section [ sec : cmp ]",
    "we compare the three methods with respect to accuracy and computation time and we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .    to make the main ideas more transparent we displace the more technical discussion of the numerical methods to the appendices [ sec : numwigner ] and [ sec : numsemi ] . for self - containedness the analytic results for the constant rotating pulse and the non - rotating sauter pulse can be found in appendices [ app : constrot ] and [ app : sauter ] respectively .",

    "we find that there is an infinite amount of turning points for the rotating sauter pulse .",
    "but in contrast to this case the turning points in the general case have different real as well as different imaginary parts ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : spectra_methods ] shows the spectrum as computed by all the available methods .",

    "the result in lcrfa has the same order of magnitude as the other results but underestimates certain features of the momentum spectrum .",
    "we will see in the next section that this is due to the small number of field cycles ( @xmath91 ) and that the approximation gets better for bigger @xmath100 .",
    "we can compute the total particle yield per volume from the momentum spectrum by integrating over momentum space @xmath101 comparing the results we find that the methods agree for an intermediate range of pulse length @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : total_yield ] ) .",
    "we also find that for short pulses the semiclassical method is not working anymore .",
    "this can be explained by looking at the non - rotating sauter pulse which is studied in more detail in appendix [ app : sauter ] .",

    "we thus find that the semiclassical approximation breaks down for the sauter pulse for short pulses which can be seen in the total pair creation rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_yield ] .",
    "there we also see that the same happens for the rotating sauter pulse .    for longer pulses the wigner method becomes numerically challenging .",
    "this is due to the fact that the integration from @xmath104 to @xmath105 , which is performed analytically in the semiclassical method , needs more steps the longer the pulse becomes . for too long pulses the precision of the result",
    "is limited by computational errors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : total_yield_20 ] for a comparison of the computation times of the numerical methods ) .",
    "we find that for @xmath106 both numerical methods have a comparable computation time around @xmath107 . for shorter pulses",
    "the wigner method is computationally faster while for longer ones the semiclassical method should be preferred .",
    "the computation time , when using the lcrfa , is dominated by the integration over the momentum spectrum which has to be performed numerically .",
    "we find that the approximation gets better for longer pulse length @xmath88 and higher @xmath100 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : total_yield ] , observe that within the lcrfa calculations the number of considered turning points has been fixed to 9 in contrast to the adaptive method used for the numerical method described in appendix [ sec : numsemi ] ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact , that the longer the pulse , the better gets the approximation of the pulse being locally constant and that for higher @xmath100 the effects of the rotation become more important with respect to the effects of the pulse shape since there are more rotation cycles per pulse length .      in section [ sec : semiclass ] we found two independent solutions of the dirac equation which were interpreted as different spin components in @xcite . to compare these with the wigner method we can construct the projections @xmath108 for @xmath49 .",
    "these projections are idempotent @xmath109 and orthogonal @xmath110 they also fulfill @xmath111 for the two independent solutions of the dirac equation defined in eq .  .",
    "accordingly they project on the two parts of the spectrum which correspond to these solutions . in eq .",
    "it is evident , that the two solutions from the scattering method correspond to a linear combination of chirality and magnetic momentum .    while in the context of the wigner function , which contains the full spinor information , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , given in eqs .   and",

    "the latter can be related to the previously defined chiral and magnetic momentum asymmetries @xmath32 and @xmath117 respectively as @xmath118 using this we find that the data for the semiclassical and wigner method agree ( see figs .  [",

    "this shows that the two independent solutions of the semiclassical method represent spinor states with specific chirality and magnetic moment .",
    "in this work we compare the semiclassical pair creation rate found using a scattering ansatz to the rate resulting from the wigner method .",
    "the numerical semiclassical results are found to be complementary to the wigner results in terms of accuracy as well as computation time . while the results agree for intermediate pulse lengths , for short pulses the semiclassical approximation breaks down and the computation time becomes high .",
    "the advantage of the semiclassical method is that one does not have to integrate numerically with respect to real time .",
    "this is especially useful for long pulse lengths since numerical problems arise in the wigner method , which increase the required computation time and limit accuracy .",
    "we also introduce the lcrfa for rotating field pulses and show that is has the same features as the numerical results and works especially well for pulse lengths @xmath119 .",
    "this is intriguing since the parameters of current and near future laser systems fulfill this requirement .",
    "it can therefore be used to study different pulse shapes qualitatively .",
    "this is of special interest since it was shown that pair creation depends sensitively on the pulse shape of lasers @xcite . using an optimization approach similar to the one used in @xcite one could use the lcrfa to investigate a great number of possible pulse shapes because of the small computation time compared to numerical methods .",
    "the latter could be used subsequently to verify the results for interesting pulse shapes .",
    "in addition to that we find that the two independent solutions of the dirac equation found for the scattering approach , which have been interpreted as spin states in @xcite can be given a clear interpretation .",
    "this is done with the help of projections which show that the solutions can be associated with particles having a specific chirality and magnetic moment and how the same spectra can be computed within the wigner method .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite the fact that one of these solutions dominates the spectrum for a certain range of parameters might help to differentiate pairs produced by the schwinger process from other particles detected in high energy experiments .",
