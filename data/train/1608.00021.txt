    "considering two complex scalar fields the most general @xmath14 symmetric self - interaction potential has already been given in ref .",

    "we shall consider theories where the potential , @xmath20 , is given by , moreover we require that @xmath21 for @xmath22 , resulting in the following restriction of the parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the following two types of minima of the potential shall be considered : either a state when only a single scalar field has a vev , referred to as 1vev case , and the other one is a 2vev case where both fields obtain a vev .",
    "the conditions for a 2vev state is @xmath26 from which @xmath27 follows . in this 2vev case ,",
    "the two vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields , @xmath28 satisfy @xmath29 and the previous conditions guarantee that @xmath30 .    if at least one of the conditions in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2vevcond ] ) fails to hold , the system is in a 1vev state , and the component having the non - zero vev is as follows : @xmath31 the classification in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2vevcond ] ) , ( [ eq : vevcond1 ] ) is crucial .",
    "if @xmath32 , then at @xmath33 , there is a boundary between the upper component 1vev and the 2vev cases .",
    "if , on the contrary , @xmath34 then at @xmath35 , there is a boundary between upper component and lower component 1vev cases , there the lower component obtains a vev @xmath36 .    in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : vevcond1 ] ) , we have used that in order that the global minimum of the potential be at the field values @xmath37 , @xmath38 has to hold with @xmath39 .",
    "condition ( [ eq : cond1stab1 ] ) corresponds to that out of the two possible local minima @xmath37 and @xmath40 the first one be the global minimum .",
    "this can be assumed without loss of generality ( because otherwise the second component would be the one obtaining a vev , and the two components could be interchanged ) .",
    "let us start by considering the two component scalar theory with interaction potential , admitting a global u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry , defined by the lagrangian @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the potential , @xmath20 , is given by eq .  .",
    "we shall now consider global vortex solutions of the theory with rotational symmetry in the plane , with the following ( standard ) ansatz for the scalars @xmath44 where @xmath3 and @xmath45 are integers and @xmath46 are the polar coordinates in the plane .",
    "the radial equations read in this case @xmath47\\,,\\\\    \\frac{1}{r}(r f_2 ' ) ' & = f_2 \\left [ \\frac{m^2}{r^2 } + \\beta_2 f_2 ^ 2 - \\alpha + \\beta ' f_1 ^ 2 \\right]\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and with the ansatz ( [ eq : globans ] ) , the energy density from the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : globlag ] ) is @xmath48 in the following we shall focus on vortices with @xmath49 , as they are expected to give solutions of `` lowest '' energy . in the present 1vev case embedded global ano - type vortices , @xmath50",
    "automatically satisfy eqs .  .",
    "as it is known , the total energy of global vortices diverges : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an arbitrary ( core ) radius , outside of which all fields can be replaced with their asymptotic form .",
    "the energy of the vortices diverges logarithmically with the sample size .",
    "as a non - zero @xmath53 lowers the potential energy in the vortex core , it is natural to expect that eqs .",
    "may also admit vortex solutions with a non - trivial @xmath53 .",
    "a simple method to search for such non - trivially two - component vortices is to look for the instability of the embedded one .",
    "this can be done by linearising eqs .   around an embedded vortex in the small parameter @xmath54 as follows : @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfies the following linear schrdinger - type equation , with a  potential  determined by the embedded vortex , @xmath57 : @xmath58 in order that one obtain a linearized vortex solution , one has to impose @xmath59 for @xmath60 . then eq .",
    "can be interpreted as an eigenvalue problem for the `` energy '' @xmath61 as a function of the parameter @xmath18 . for the parameter range @xmath62 ,",
    "embedded global vortices are unstable , and they bifurcate with a new family of solutions with a nontrivial @xmath63 as @xmath64 , to which we shall refer to as condensate core ( cc ) vortices . a numerical solution for a global cc vortex is depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : globcc ] .",
    "although the energy of a cc vortex is also divergent logarithmically , just as for an embedded one , for a fixed sample size @xmath65 , the energy difference between the two types can be computed .",
    "it turns out that cc vortices have lower energy than the embedded ones , and in some cases the energy difference is remarkably large ( table [ tab : globcc ] ) .",
    "remarkably good approximate solutions of eq .   are known for both large and small values of @xmath18 . in the case",
    "when @xmath66 , the lowest eigenfunction is concentrated close to the origin , therefore a good approximation of the potential term is only needed there . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential to leading order is harmonic yielding a qualitatively good approximation of eq .  .",
    "the harmonic approximation can be substantially improved by taking into account the taylor expansion of @xmath67 up to the @xmath68 order via perturbation theory @xcite , yielding @xmath69 where @xmath70 . for small @xmath18 , a matching procedure at the boundary of the vortex core yields the eigenvalue @xcite @xmath71\\,,\\quad \\left(\\beta ' < \\frac{\\beta_1}{3}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "a similar result has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of gauged vortices , based on approximate eigenvalues of shallow potentials in 2d @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been demonstrated numerically , that global vortices for @xmath10 are unstable against splitting into vortices of lower winding .",
    "this is in agreement with the known _ repulsive _ interaction between global vortices at large separations @xcite . for cc vortices , the leading order asymptotic behaviour is unchanged",
    ", therefore at large separation there should be a repulsive interaction between them .",
    "on the other hand , for cc vortices close to each other , the nonzero second component also contributes to the inter - vortex force .",
    "we have performed a stability analysis with the methods of ref .",
    "we have found that for parameter values of @xmath19 away from the bifurcation @xmath73 , @xmath74 cc vortices are stable at the linear level . in the case of the embedded vortex , for @xmath75",
    ", there is an energy lowering perturbation ( an eigenfunction of the perturbation operator with a negative eigenvalue ) in the partial wave channel @xmath76 , and for @xmath77 in @xmath78 . for the cc vortex ,",
    "sufficiently far from the bifurcation , these eigenvalues become positive .",
    "we denote by @xmath79 the value of @xmath19 where all of the eigenvalues become positive .",

    "it is remarkable , that the character of the inter - vortex force changes in the two - component theory , from attractive at small separations to repulsive at large ones .",
