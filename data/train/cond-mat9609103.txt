    "<S> * abstract . * the mechanism of coherent destruction of tunneling found by grossmann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . lett . * 67 * , 516 ( 1991 ) ] is studied from the viewpoint of quantum optics by considering the photon statistics of a single mode cavity field which is strongly coupled to a two - level tunneling system ( ts ) . as a function of the interaction time between ts and cavity the photon statistics displays the tunneling dynamics . in the semi - classical limit of high photon occupation number @xmath0 , coherent destruction of tunneling </S>",
    "<S> is exhibited in a slowing down of an amplitude modulation for certain parameter ratios of the field . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is explained as arising from interference between displaced number states in phase space which survives the large @xmath0 limit due to identical @xmath1 scaling between orbit width and displacement .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : 42.50.ct , 42.50.lc , 05.30.-d    2    in recent years the idea of modulation and therefore control of tunneling by a monochromatic electromagnetic field has been subject of considerable interest . </S>",
    "<S> the typical hamiltonian describes a particle in an isolated double - well potential ( dwp ) which is periodically driven by an external force @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the dwp , @xmath4 is the amplitude and @xmath5 the driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the attention has mainly focused on a possible enhancement or suppression of coherent tunneling : lin and ballentine@xcite have demonstrated that the tunneling probability is highly enhanced due to periodic modulation for high field strengths and driving frequencies close to the classical oscillation frequency at the bottom of each well . in the opposite limit grossmann , hnggi and coworkers@xcite found complete suppression of tunneling such that a particle initially localized in one of the two wells will never escape to the other well . </S>",
    "<S> they termed this effect `` coherent destruction of tunneling '' . </S>",
    "<S> it has since been of continuing interest.@xcite the most surprising feature is the _ periodicity _ of the destruction of tunneling for certain parameter ratios of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . so far there is no clear understanding of this phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> by using the floquet formalism it has been shown that many characteristic features of the tunneling suppression can already be described in a two - level approximation of the dwp.@xcite many different aspects of the effect have been illuminated in this framework : makarov@xcite , plata and gomez llorente@xcite quantized the electromagnetic field and recovered the effect in the limit of large number of photons in the field . </S>",
    "<S> wang and shao@xcite mapped the driven two - level dynamics to a classical one of a charged particle moving in a harmonic potential plus a magnetic field in a plane . </S>",
    "<S> kayanuma@xcite explained the suppression of tunneling as an effect arising from interference at periodic level crossings .    in the present rapid communication , </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation is proposed which uses the concept of _ phase space interference _ known from squeezed states@xcite and displaced number states@xcite in quantum optics .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with a description of the physical situation we have in mind . at @xmath6 a single two - level tunneling system ( ts ) prepared in a state localized in </S>",
    "<S> say the left well @xmath7 is injected in a cavity and starts to tunnel between its left and right state @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity contains a single mode which has been prepared in a number state @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an ideal cavity , i.e. , we neglect any kind of dissipation . after an interaction time </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 the ts leaves the cavity and the photon number distribution is measured irrespective of the state of the ts .    </S>",
    "<S> thus our aim will be to calculate the transition probability from the product state @xmath11 at @xmath6 to another product state @xmath12 for any @xmath13 at time @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 . for fixed @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> this is the photon number distribution with @xmath17 . for fixed @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath19 describes the dynamics of the cavity mode interacting with a ts .    </S>",
    "<S> an important aspect of the present problem is the strong coupling between the cavity mode and the ts , and the separation of timescales between the _ slow _ tunneling motion and the _ fast _ field oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote the coupling energy by @xmath20 and the tunneling frequency by @xmath21 , this means that we are interested in the limit @xmath22 and @xmath23 for low , and @xmath24 for high number of photons in the field .    in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the field strongly dresses the ts and both ts + field have to be treated as a single unit . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the situation where @xmath25 , we are confronted in the present case with a situation in which the rotating - wave approximation is not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> thus instead of using the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian@xcite , we must include counter - rotating terms so that our hamiltonian reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the cavity mode </S>",
    "<S> . we have identified @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the usual formulation of the hamiltionian in quantum optics is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> we also have added a constant energy shift for later convenience . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be noted that suppression of tunneling does not occur in the jaynes - cummings model.@xcite hence the situation here is fundamentially different from the one usually encountered in quantum optics .    </S>",
    "<S> owing to the separation of timescales between the tunneling and the oscillation dynamics , @xmath19 can be calculated in perturbation theory in @xmath32 by introducing dressed states @xmath33 and @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , one may perform the polaron transformation @xmath36 and continue to use the product state instead of the dressed state basis . in the dressed state basis </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] is the shift operator and @xmath41 an associate laguerre polynomial ( @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal part @xmath43 builds a ladder of tunneling doublets with intra - doublet spacing @xmath44 and inter - doublet spacing @xmath45 . because @xmath46 , @xmath47 induces only mixing between dressed states belonging to _ different _ doublets </S>",
    "<S> hence , corrections to the dressed states are @xmath48 . neglecting @xmath47 for this reason we find for the transition probability if @xmath42 @xmath49 and @xmath50 if @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> _ we conclude that the tunneling dynamics can be seen in the spectrum of the transition probability of the cavity field . _ in addition to harmonics of @xmath5 its power spectrum also contains resonances at @xmath52 arising from the tunneling motion . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior strongly depends on the initial preparation of the ts . </S>",
    "<S> injecting it in its ground state @xmath53 , for instance , yields only resonances at @xmath54 where @xmath55 depending on whether @xmath56 is even or odd , respectively , and hence only rapid oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a strong coupling between the cavity mode and the ts is to mix a coherent amplitude @xmath57 with the intial number state of the mode . </S>",
    "<S> this happens by displacing the oscillator wave function @xmath58 like @xmath59 in dimensionless coordinates @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> thus by injecting a ts which strongly couples to the cavity field , it is possible to realize displaced number states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical properties of displaced number states have been discussed in ref . . the photon number distribution is simply given by @xmath61 because @xmath62 is the probability amplititude of finding @xmath18 photons in a displaced number state @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> the photon distribution ( [ 8 ] ) for number states which are _ dynamically _ displaced by the tunneling process resembles @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the displaced number states can either be shifted into the same well ( first term in ( [ 8 ] ) ) or opposite wells ( second term in ( [ 8 ] ) ) . as expected for @xmath65 , @xmath66 independent of the interaction time .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a),(b ) we have plotted @xmath19 for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 0.25 and 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas a coherent state with @xmath70 obeys the familiar poisson distribution@xcite shown by the line , the dynamically displaced number states exhibit oscillations shown by the histogram . increasing @xmath71 results in further oscillations </S>",
    "<S> this effect is independent of the specific value of @xmath72 for @xmath73 , though the absolute value of @xmath19 depends on @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> these modulations are clearly exhibited in the asymptotic expansion of ( [ 8 ] ) in the semi - classical limit ( bohr s correspondence principle ) : @xmath74 , @xmath75 with @xmath76 finite . </S>",
    "<S> if we scale the coupling constant between the field and the ts as @xmath77 and note that associate laguerre polynomials asymptotically approach bessel functions@xcite one finds in the semi - classical limit @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the renormalized tunneling frequency , and @xmath80 is the rabi frequency . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c),(d ) , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 9 ] ) is plotted for @xmath81 1 and 3.3 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows the same oscillations as the exact expression ( [ 8 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the expression ( [ 9 ] ) is easily understood . </S>",
    "<S> the cosine and the sine factors represent the probability for the tunneling particle to stay in the well where it has been prepared initially , or to escape to the other well , respectively.@xcite the bessel functions represent the probability for the corresponding displaced number state to contain @xmath18 photons if it had @xmath0 initially ( note that @xmath82 in the semi - classical limit ) . hence the bessel functions represent the photon statistics of displaced number states with an effective displacement @xmath83 or @xmath84 . from ( [ 10 ] ) and the cosine and sine factors in ( [ 9 ] ) we further see that for specific parameter values of the driving field  where @xmath85 hits the roots of the zero order bessel function  </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling process is completely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> note that localization can not occur for small photon number in the field because there is no value of @xmath71 which is simultaneously a root of all laguerre polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in the large @xmath0 limit _ the tunneling dynamics is displayed in the photon statistics by an amplitude modulation of the cavity mode oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> _ _ coherent destruction of tunneling manifests itself in the slowing down of this amplitude modulation _ as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show how the present picture can give a quantitative understanding of this effect . </S>",
    "<S> first recall that the oscillation in the photon number statistics in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 originate from phase space interference:@xcite the @xmath0th number state can be associated with a circular band of width @xmath86 around its orbit with radius @xmath87 and centered around the origion . </S>",
    "<S> analogously so can the @xmath18th displaced number state which is shifted by @xmath88 . according to the area - of - overlap concept@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the transition amplitude between two states is governed by the sum of all possible overlap areas weighted with appropriate phases . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the interference between contributions from different overlaps which can be constructive or destructive , thus , giving rise to oscillations in the photon number distribution . </S>",
    "<S> another way of understanding the oscillations is that they arise from the possibility of a constructive and destructive overlap between displaced harmonic oscillator wave functions by noting that @xmath89 is a polynomial in @xmath18 of order min@xmath90 , i.e. , has min@xmath90 roots .    from this consideration </S>",
    "<S> it becomes apparent that varying the relative radius of the two bands by changing @xmath18 vs. @xmath0 , or varying the relative displacement by changing @xmath71 for fixed @xmath18 and @xmath0 should result in similar effects . </S>",
    "<S> if one notices further that the factor @xmath91 in ( [ 10 ] ) is the probability amplitude of finding in a number state displaced by @xmath92 again exactly the same number of photons , one expects that the periodic suppression of tunneling arises from destructive and constructive interference of displaced harmonic oscillator wave functions in phase space .    to verify this argument </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath93 limit has to be considered with care . </S>",
    "<S> first take the number of photons in the cavity mode to be finite . the factor @xmath94 which scales the doublet splitting ( [ 6 ] ) is the overlap between a number state @xmath9 shifted into the right well with the same number state shifted into the left well . </S>",
    "<S> if we note that @xmath94 is a polynomial in @xmath95 of degree @xmath0 , and consequently has @xmath0 zeros , we expect @xmath96 oscillations of @xmath94 as a function of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 zeros between the maxima result from the @xmath0 possible ways of destructive overlap between displaced harmonic oscillator wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> this explains fig . 2 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrary to the claim there , this picture remains also valid if the oscillator energy is larger than the reorganization energy @xmath97 , and even in the limit @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the simple reason for this is that in the semi - classical limit @xmath93 with @xmath98 fixed , both the distance between the nodes of the harmonic oscillator wave function ( as a function of @xmath99 ) _ and _ the displacement @xmath92 scale as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> based on this argument , we expect oscillation to become noticable as soon as the displacement exceeds the bandwidth , i.e. , @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that with the scaling chosen above both displaced orbits will always intersect no matter how large @xmath101 is . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the infinite number of oscillations seen in the zero order bessel function ( [ 10 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing coherent destruction of tunneling is explained as a _ quantum effect arising from the destructive interference of displaced harmonic oscillator wave functions in phase space_. the effect is strictly speaking only observable in the semi - classical limit for the reasons mentioned above , and survives the large @xmath0 limit since both _ the bandwidth of the orbit and the displacement scale in the same way to zero as _ @xmath102 .    in closing , we note that experimental study of the effects described here is presently still out of range . in a microcavity </S>",
    "<S> the driving frequency @xmath5 is @xmath103(ghz ) whereas typical values of the one - photon rabi frequency @xmath104 are @xmath103(khz).@xcite hence a number state with large @xmath0 is needed which is difficult to realize experimentally . possibly a trap is more suited because of its lower driving frequency @xmath105(mhz).@xcite damping of the cavity mode which is too strong will also render an observation impossible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the tunneling dynamics must still be coherent . </S>",
    "<S> finally the superposition state @xmath106 is difficult to prepare because the particle experiences strong electromagnetic fields when it enters and leaves the cavity@xcite ( for a discussion of this point if one uses quantum wells , see ref . ) .    </S>",
