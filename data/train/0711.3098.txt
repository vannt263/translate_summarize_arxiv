    "hadron spectroscopy has undergone a great renaissance in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the new findings include : low - lying excitations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , long - awaited missing states and new states near 4 gev / c@xmath2 in the charmonium spectrum , charmed and bottom baryons , and evidence for doubly charmed baryons .",
    "the light hadron sector remains also restless reporting new scalar mesons or showing a deep theoretical interest in the high energy part of both the meson and baryon spectra .",
    "the hadron spectra should be described in terms of qcd .",
    "tested to very high accuracy in the perturbative regime , its low energy sector ( _ strong qcd _ ) comprising hadron physics , remains challenging because neither lattice nor perturbative methods are accurate . as in most other areas of physics , the keys to a qualitative understanding of strong qcd are to identify the appropriate degrees of freedom and the effective forces between them  @xcite .",
    "all roads lead to valence constituent quarks as the appropriate degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the effective forces , summarizing the basic properties of qcd , must at least contain : a confining mechanism , a spin - spin force and a long - range term .",
    "this framework is what we know as the constituent quark model .",
    "although quark models differ in their details , the qualitative aspects of their spectra are determined by features that they share in common .",
    "these common ingredients can be used to project expectations for new sectors  @xcite .",
    "the limitations of the quark model are as obvious as its successes .",
    "nevertheless almost all hadrons can be classified as relatively simple configurations of a few confined quarks .",
    "nowadays , we have the tools to deepen our understanding of strong qcd . on one side",
    "we have at our disposal powerful numerical techniques imported from few - body physics : faddeev calculations in momentum space  @xcite , hyperspherical harmonic expansions  @xcite and stochastic variational methods  @xcite . on the other",
    "we have an increasing number of experimental data .",
    "in this work we review some recent results and selected theoretical analysis on heavy baryons , heavy mesons , and light baryons .",

    "it was already in 1985 when bjorken wrote  @xcite : `` we should strive to study triply charmed baryons because their excitation spectrum should be close to the perturbative qcd regime '' .",
    "the larger the number of heavy quarks the simpler the system . in particular ,",
    "doubly and triply heavy baryons are driven only by a perturbative one - gluon exchange ( oge ) , while single heavy baryons include the dynamics of light and heavy - light quark pairs .",
    "baryons with one , two or three heavy quarks are the ideal laboratory to test the assumed flavor independence of confinement  @xcite .",

    "therefore , the contribution of gluons is diminished for models considering pions .",

    "more than thirty years after the so - called november revolution  @xcite , heavy meson spectroscopy is being severely tested by new experiments  @xcite .",
    "this challenging situation arose in the open - charm sector with the discovery of the @xmath29 , the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 mesons , positive parity states with masses smaller than expectations from quark potential models .",
    "one could say in general that the area phenomenologically understood in the open - charm meson spectrum extends to states where the @xmath32 pair is in relative @xmath33wave . in the positive parity sector , @xmath34wave states , is where the problems arise .",
    "this has been said as an example where naive quark models are probably too naive  @xcite . out of the many explanations suggested for these states ,",
    "the unquenching of the naive quark model has been successful  @xcite .",
    "when a @xmath32 pair occurs in a @xmath34wave but can couple to hadron pairs in @xmath33wave the latter will distort the @xmath32 picture . in the examples mentioned above , the @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 states predicted above the @xmath38 thresholds couple to the continuum .",
    "this mixes @xmath38 components in the wave function .",
    "this idea can be easily formulated in terms of a meson wave - function described by @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for quark degrees of freedom and the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 take into account the admixture of four - quark components in the @xmath43 picture .",
    "results for the open - charm mesons  @xcite show that they are easily identified with standard @xmath44 states except for the @xmath29 , the @xmath30 , and the @xmath45 .",
    "thus , one could be tempted to interpret them as four - quark resonances within the quark model .",
    "other results obtained with the same interacting potential  @xcite are : for @xmath46 , @xmath47 2731 mev , @xmath48 2699 mev , @xmath49 2841 mev , @xmath50 2793 mev , and for @xmath51 , @xmath52 2505 mev .",
    "all of them are far above the corresponding strong decay threshold and therefore broad in contrast to experiment , what rules out a pure four - quark interpretation .",
    "thus , physical states may correspond to a mixing of two- and four - body configurations , eq .",
    "( [ eq - w ] ) .",
    "the results obtained are shown in table 3 in the nonstrange sector once the mixing is considered one obtains a state at 2241 mev with 46% of four - quark component and 53% of @xmath53 pair .",
    "the lowest state , representing the @xmath45 , is above the isospin preserving threshold @xmath54 , being broad as observed experimentally .",
    "the mixed configuration compares much better with the experimental data than the pure @xmath53 state .",
    "the orthogonal state appears at 2713 mev , with and important four - quark component . in the strange sector , the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 are dominantly @xmath37 @xmath55 and @xmath56 states , respectively , with almost 30% of four - quark component . without being dominant ,",
    "this percentage is fundamental to shift the mass of the unmixed states to the experimental values below the @xmath57 and @xmath58 thresholds and , therefore , they are expected to have small widths .",
