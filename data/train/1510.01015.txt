    "the existence of neutrino mass and dark matter is a clear sign of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "another long - standing issue in sm is the strong cp problem  @xcite which is elegantly resolved by the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it predicts a hypothetical particle called the axion as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson of an anomalous global symmetry @xmath0 which is spontaneously broken at an intermediate scale @xmath1 gev  @xcite .",
    "the pq symmetry is realized typically in the context of a heavy quark ( ksvz ) model  @xcite or a two - higgs - doublet ( dfsz ) model  @xcite .",
    "the pq symmetry breaking may be related to the seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of the observed neutrino masses  @xcite identifying the pq symmetry as the lepton number @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "let us note that the seesaw mechanism realized at the intermediate scale @xmath3 can provide a natural way to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe through leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of this scenario is that the axion is a good candidate of cold dark matter through its coherent production during the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "as the axion is well - motivated dark matter candidate , serious efforts are being made to search for it by various experimental groups such as admx  @xcite , capp  @xcite and iaxo  @xcite .",
    "the traditional ksvz or dfsz models have been considered as two major benchmarks in search for the axion dark matter .    in the context of the pq mechanism combined with the seesaw mechanism , however",
    ", the electromagnetic and color anomaly coefficients can take different values , and thus can have different predictions in the future axion search experiments .",
    "this moviates us to consider minimal extensions of the sm in which various seesaw models  @xcite are extended to realize the ksvz or dfsz axion , and compare their predictions with the conventional ksvz and dfsz models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will first set up minimal extensions of the sm to combine the pq and seesaw mechanisms in non - supersymmetric and supersymmetric theories in sections ii and iii , respectively .",
    "the corresponding model predictions are presented in section iv , and then we conclude in section v.",
    "a pq seesaw model is characterized by how a global @xmath4 symmetry , playing the role of the pq symmetry and the lepton number , is implemented to act on a specific set of extra fermions carrying non - trivial @xmath5 charges .",
    "such an @xmath4 symmetry is supposed to be broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field @xmath6 assuming a scalar potential : @xmath7 with @xmath8 gev which sets the scales of the axion decay constant @xmath9 and the heavy seesaw particles . in the case of the type - i and type - ii seesaw introducing a singlet fermion ( right - handed neutrino ) @xcite and a higgs triplet scalar @xcite respectively ,",
    "their combinations with the ksvz and dfsz axion models leads to the same results to the conventional ones .",
    "thus , we consider the type - iii seesaw ( by heavy lepton triplets ) @xcite implementing the pq symmetry in the manner of ksvz or dfsz .    * * ksvz+type - iii ( ksvz - iii ) * : in a ksvz model combined with type - iii seesaw ( lepton triplets with zero hypercharge ) , we add as usual an extra heavy quark field @xmath10 which transforms as ( 3,1,0 ) under @xmath11 , and three ( majorana ) lepton triplets which transform as ( 1,3,0 ) .",
    "the right - handed and left - handed lepton triplets are denoted by @xmath12 where heavy neutrino @xmath13 , heavy charged leptons @xmath14 , @xmath15 with the charge conjugation @xmath16 and the pauli matrix @xmath17 .",
    "the non - trivial x - charges are assigned as follows @xmath18 compatible with the yukawa lagrangian for the ksvz - iii model , @xmath19 \\cr   \\frac{1}{2}{\\rm tr}[\\overline{\\sigma^{c}}h_\\sigma\\sigma^ * \\sigma ]   \\end{cases }   + \\text{h.c . }",
    "\\label{lagrangian2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand for the higgs doublet and the lepton doublet in the sm , respectively , and @xmath22 . depending on the @xmath5-charge signs of the triplet fermion one couples @xmath6 or @xmath23 to the triplet as denoted by iii@xmath24 or iii@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "note that we took the normalization of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ xcharges11 ] ) under which the qcd anomaly is the number of the heavy quarks : @xmath27 .",
    "+ after the @xmath4 breaking by an appropriate scalar potential ( [ vsigma ] ) , the complex scalar field @xmath6 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is nothing but the ksvz axion , and the real scalar @xmath30 is supposed to get mass @xmath31 which sets the axion and seesaw scales . + * * dfsz+type - iii ( dfsz - iii ) * : in a dfsz axion model , the pq symmetry is implemented by extending the higgs sector with two higgs doublets , @xmath32 with @xmath33 , and a higgs singlet @xmath6 , and allowing the scalar potential term @xmath34 which sets the pq ( @xmath5 ) charge relation of the two higgs bosons : @xmath35 again under the normalization of @xmath26 .",
    "+ then the yukawa lagrangian for dfsz - iii reads @xmath36 \\cr \\frac{1}{2}{\\rm tr}[\\overline{\\sigma^{c}}h_\\sigma\\sigma^ * \\sigma ] \\end{cases } + \\text{h.c . } ,   \\label{lagrangian21 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one can choose @xmath37 or @xmath38 depending on which we categorize two different dfsz models . as we again have two choices for the triplet mass operator with @xmath6 or @xmath23 , there are four different dfsz - iii models",
    ". + eqs .",
    "( [ v21],[lagrangian21 ] ) give six @xmath5-charge relations to be satisfied by the eight fields ( other than @xmath6 ) .",
    "as will be discussed shortly , the orthogonality of the axion and the longitudinal degree of the @xmath39 boson gives another condition .",
    "then , one finds that there is freedom to choose one of the three quark charges .",
    "taking @xmath40 , we get the following x - charge assignment : @xmath41 where we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 leading to the qcd anomaly @xmath44 with the number of the generation @xmath45 .",
    "+ after the breaking of @xmath46 by the vacuum expectation values , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , of @xmath49 and @xmath6 , the axion and the longitudinal degree of the @xmath39 boson denoted by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are given by @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the phase fields of @xmath49 and @xmath6 .",
    "then the orthogonality of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is guaranteed by @xmath55 with the normalization @xmath26 and @xmath56 .",
    "to implement the pq symmetry in supersymmetric models , let us introduce two chiral superfields @xmath57 and @xmath58 having the opposite x charges , say , @xmath59 , and its spontaneous breaking is assumed to occur by the typical superpotential : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is implied in the notation .",
    "here @xmath63 is a gauge singlet superfield and carry pq charge zero .",
    "the supersymmetric version of the ksvz model introduces the heavy quark superpotential @xmath64 which defines the pq charge relation : @xmath65 leading to the qcd anomaly : @xmath66 as in the nonsupersymmetric case . here",
    "@xmath67 is the usual minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) superpotential given by @xmath68 which is separated from the pq mechanism .",
    "the supersymmetric dfsz model provides a natural framework to resolve the @xmath69 problem as well @xcite by extending the higgs sector @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the reduced planck mass and the right size of the @xmath69 term , @xmath72 , arises after the pq symmetry breaking .",
    "the usual pq charges assignment consistent with the above superpoential is @xmath73 where we have put @xmath74 as before and @xmath75 follows from the charge normalization of @xmath76 . at this stage , there is arbitrariness in choosing the value of @xmath77 , but it will be fixed in seesaw extended pq models which has no physical consequences .",
    "note that the qcd anomaly of the supersymmetric dfsz model is again given by @xmath78 .",
    "now let us consider the seesaw extensions of the supersymmetric pq models .",
    "as in the non - supersymmetric case , type - i seesaw introducing right - handed ( singlet ) neutrinos does not change the results of the standard ksvz and dfsz models .",
    "thus , we discuss the type - ii and -iii extensions in order .    * * ksvz+type - ii ( sksvz - ii ) * : type - ii seesaw introduces a dirac pair of @xmath79 triplet superfields with the hypercharge @xmath80 : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "its combination with the ksvz model can be realized by the superpotential : @xmath83 which set the pq charges of the leptonic fields : @xmath84 * * dfsz+type - ii ( sdfsz - ii ) * : similarly to the previous case , the superpotential for the dfsz model combined with type - ii seesaw takes the form : @xmath85 which is invariant under the pq symmetry with the charge assignment of ( [ xdfsz ] ) extended to the leptonic sector as follows : @xmath86 * * ksvz+type - iii ( sksvz - iii ) * : in supersymmetric type - iii seesaw one introduces three triplet superfields ( with @xmath87 ) denoted by @xmath88 then the whole superpotential of the ksvz model realized in type - iii seesaw is @xmath89 \\cr { 1\\over2 } \\lambda_{\\bar\\sigma } \\hat { \\sigma }   \\mbox{tr}[\\hat\\sigma \\hat\\sigma ] \\cr   \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines the pq charges of the leptonic fields as in the non - supersymmetric case : @xmath90 * * dfsz+type - iii ( sdfsz - iii ) * : type - iii seesaw introduces three triplet superfields ( with @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 + the superpotential is @xmath91 \\cr { 1\\over2 } \\lambda_{\\bar\\sigma } \\hat { \\sigma }   \\mbox{tr}[\\hat\\sigma \\hat\\sigma ] \\cr   \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which set the pq charges of the leptonic fields : @xmath92",
    "to discuss the implications of the pq seesaw models presented in the previous sections , let us first summarize some basic properties of the axion relevant for our discussion @xcite .",
    "after the pq symmetry breaking by a generic number of scalar fields @xmath93 having the pq charge @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the following combination of the phase fields @xmath96 defines the axion direction : @xmath97 integrating out all the relevant pq - charged fermions , the axion gets the effective axion - gluon - gluon and axion - photon - photon couplings through its color and electromagnetic anomalies , respectively : @xmath98 where the axion decay constant @xmath9 is defined by @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the ` modified ' electromagnetic anomaly normalized by the color anomaly @xmath101 of the pq symmetry . below the qcd scale @xmath102 mev",

    "@xmath113 counts the electromagnetic anomaly normalized by the color anomaly , and @xmath114 is the modified effect by the chiral symmetry breaking including the strange quark contribution .",
    "+    each pq seesaw model presented in the previous section give a different prediction on the coefficient @xmath113 and thus on the future sensitivity of the axion search at admx or capp .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ cagg ] ) , the electromagnetic anomaly of each model is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are used for the ksvz and dfsz models , respectively .    in fig .",
    "i , we plot the axion - photon - photon coupling @xmath118 as a function of axion mass @xmath119 , and compare them with the conventional ksvz ( @xmath120 ) and dfsz ( @xmath121 , or @xmath122 ) predictions .",
    "the experiments such as admx  @xcite , capp  @xcite , cast  @xcite , iaxo  @xcite , are projected to probe some regions of the parameter space of the axion coupling to photons and its mass . in fig .  1 .",
    "the cyan- ( red- ) thick dashed boundary indicates the future sensitivity of the axion dark matter search by admx ( capp )  @xcite .",
    "the current admx results  @xcite excludes only a limited region of ksvz type models and dfsz@xmath123-iii@xmath124 , sdfsz - ii@xmath125 models over the mass range of @xmath126ev .",
    "solar axion search experiments like cast and iaxo are also sensitive to the pq axions . cast probes the axion mass range of @xmath127 ev for @xmath128 , while iaxo would have sensitivity to much larger axion masses compared to cast if @xmath129 .",
    "most recently , cast has improved the limit on the axion - photon - photon coupling to @xmath130gev@xmath131 at 95@xmath132 c.l .",
    "this may exclude the models above the ksvz line over the mass range @xmath133 ev , which can be seen by considering the mass values at @xmath134 gev@xmath131 in the various models like sksvz - ii@xmath25 ( @xmath135 ev ) , sksvz - ii@xmath136 , sksvz - iii@xmath25 , ksvz - iii@xmath124 ( @xmath137 ev ) , sksvz - iii@xmath24 , ksvz - iii@xmath136 ( @xmath138 ev ) , sdfsz - ii@xmath125 ( @xmath139 ev ) , dfsz@xmath123-iii@xmath124 ( @xmath140 ev ) , and ksvz ( @xmath141 ev ) .",
    "we have considered minimal extensions of the sm combining the ksvz or dfsz axion with various seesaw models in the framework of the ( non- ) supersymmetric theories , which provides a popular solution to the strong cp problem as well as the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "we have showed that depending on how to embed @xmath0 in a seesaw model , the electromagnetic and color anomaly coefficients take different values , and thus each model has a different prediction on the axion - photon - photon coupling which could be tested in the future axion search experiments .",
    "this sets up various benchmark points for the minimal pq seesaw models in comparison with the standard ksvz and dfsz models which are summarized in eq .",
