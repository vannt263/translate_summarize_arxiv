    "polar amplification posits that if the average global temperature increases , the relative change in the polar regions will be larger , and hence the observed decline of the arctic sea ice cover during the satellite era has been a key focus of research @xcite .",
    "the arctic oscillation ( ao ) is an indicator of how atmospheric circulation can be related to observed changes in the sea ice cover .",
    "however , because it captures only approximately 50% of the variability of the sea level pressure @xcite , it has been argued that the characteristics of the ao may have changed over time in a manner that the ao index is less predictive @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance here is the prevalence of free drift , and hence how sea level pressure and ice velocity are correlated .",
    "first , as the ice cover has thinned , modeling studies indicate that the mechanical and dynamical properties will change , and predict free drift becomes increasingly prevalent @xcite .",
    "second , the wind - driven circulation has oscillated between cyclonic and anticyclonic ( at 5 to 7 year intervals ) from 1948 to 1996 , after which the anticyclonic pattern has prevailed @xcite .",
    "thus , a central question concerns the coexistence of the changes in circulation patterns with the persistence of correlations between the wind and ice velocity fields .",
    "one of a number of the feedbacks often posited to drive polar amplification is the ice - albedo feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "due to the seasonality of the solar insolation at high latitudes , one can distill two key processes regulating the stability of the ice cover on the seasonal time scale ; the ice - albedo feedback during the summer , and the loss of heat from the surface by long - wave radiation in the winter @xcite , and these are modulated by stochastic variability @xcite . on multiple time scales",
    "( from weather to decadal ) we have extracted this variability quantitatively from satellite data on both the ice albedo itself and the equivalent ice extent ( eie ) @xcite , ; two key quantities reflecting the ice - albedo feedback .",
    "this analysis shows that the eie and the ice albedo are multi - fractal in time rather than an ar-1 process , which is commonly used to characterize arctic sea ice in climate models .",
    "indeed , one can show that an ar-1 process is inappropriate for two key reasons ; @xmath0 the existence of multiple time scales in the data can not be treated in a quantitatively consistent manner with a single decay time for the autocorrelation , and @xmath1 the strength of the seasonal cycle is such that , if not appropriately removed , model output or satellite retrievals will always have a single characteristic time of approximately 1 year ; a time scale at which all moments of the multi - fractal analysis are forced to converge @xcite .    here , we find that the velocity field of sea ice is also a multi - fractal in time exhibiting points @xmath0 and @xmath1 described above .",
    "moreover , we find ( 1 ) a three and a half decade stationarity in the spatial correlations of the horizontal velocity components and the shear in the geostrophic wind field , yielding ostensibly the same results for 1978 - 2012 as found by @xcite over a two year time window ( 1979 - 1980 ) , and ( 2 ) a robust white noise structure present in the velocity fields on annual to bi - annual time scales , which we argue underlies the white noise characteristics of the eie on these time scales .",
    "finally , whereas previous analyses @xcite have shown the correlation between ice motion and geostrophic wind from days to months , we find this to extend up to years .",
    "we use the buoy derived pressure fields computed on a regular latitude - longitude grid of @xmath2 for the period january 1 , 1979 - december 31 , 2006 @xcite .",
    "the ice motion velocity vectors are obtained in a gridded format from the national snow and ice data center ( nsidc ) @xcite .",
    "these vectors are derived from multiple sensors that include amsr - e , avhrr , iabp buoys , smmr , ssm / i , ssmis and ncep / ncar , and their coverage extends from october 25 , 1978 - december 31 , 2012 . the raw ice velocity vectors from each source are processed to form the daily gridded ice velocity fields with a spatial resolution of 25 km . to minimize the effect of the coastline on ice motion , we discard all the grid points in the fields that are within a distance of 100 km of the coast ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( figure [ fig : arctic_map ] ) .",
    "the gridded ice motion fields have the @xmath3-component referenced to @xmath4 east longitude and the @xmath5-component referenced to @xmath6 east longitude .",
    "we calculate the mean velocity in both the @xmath3- and @xmath5-directions for each day .",
    "we then analyze these time series using the multi - fractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis ( mf - twdfa ) methodology @xcite , described in the next sub - section , to extract the time scales in these time series and relate them to the time scales obtained from the analysis of eie .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ice motion data reflects both the shorter synoptic time scales and a strong seasonal cycle .",
    "importantly , this also demonstrates that by solely looking at the bare time series , one can not necessarily extract information regarding the process leading to such multiple time scale fields , which emboldens us in the use of multi - fractal methods .      in geophysical time series analysis , the two - point autocorrelation function",
    "is typically used to estimate the correlation time scale .",
    "this estimation has major drawbacks since ( @xmath7 ) it assumes that there is only a single correlation structure in the data , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the two point autocorrelation function , ( @xmath10 ) long term trends ( linear or non - linear ) and periodicities present in the data may obscure the estimated time scales .",
    "thus , in order to characterize the dynamics of the system , one may need multiple exponents , @xmath11 .",
    "namely , it is possible that for some @xmath12 there is an exponent @xmath13 , for some @xmath14 there is an exponent @xmath15 , and so forth .",
    "a two - point autocorrelation function will give a 1 year time scale for any signal with a sufficiently strong seasonal cycle and thereby mask any other time scales @xcite .",
    "this also serves as a motivation for using the multi - fractal methodology for the sea ice velocity fields .",
    "there are four stages in the implementation of mf - twdfa @xcite , which we summarize in turn .",
    "+ ( * 1 . * ) one constructs a non - stationary _ profile _ @xmath16 of the original time series @xmath17 , which is the cumulative sum @xmath18 ( * 2 . * ) one divides the profile into @xmath19 segments of equal length @xmath20 that do not overlap . excepting rare circumstances",
    ", the original time series is not an exact multiple of @xmath20 leaving excess segments of @xmath16 .",
    "these are dealt with by repeating the procedure from the end of the profile and returning to the beginning and hence creating @xmath21 segments .",

    ", however , a moving window that is smaller than @xmath20 , but determined by the distance between points , is used to construct a point by point approximation to the profile , @xmath25 .",
    "we then compute the variance up ( @xmath26 ) and down ( @xmath27 ) the profile as @xmath28s + i ) - { \\hat{y}}([\\nu-1]s + i ) \\}^2 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the scaling of @xmath34 is characterized by a generalized hurst exponent @xmath36 viz .",
    ", @xmath37    a few characteristics are worth pointing out at this juncture ( e.g. , ref . * ? ? ? * and refs . therein ) .",
    "the dominant time scales are the points where the fluctuation function changes slope , i.e. shifts from one dynamical behavior to another . for a monofractal time",
    "series , the generalized hurst exponents @xmath36 are independent of @xmath35 . if there is long term persistence in the data then , @xmath38 for @xmath39 which also serves as a check for the two - point autocorrelation function",
    ". one can relate @xmath40 to the slope of the power spectrum @xmath41 as follows .",
    "if @xmath42 , with frequency @xmath43 , then @xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a white noise process @xmath45 and hence @xmath46 . for a red noise process @xmath47 and hence @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the slope of the fluctuation function curves as a function of @xmath20 reveal the different dynamical processes that operate on different time scales .",
    "this then implies that if the data is only short term correlated ( @xmath49 ) , its asymptotic behavior will be given by @xmath46 .",
    "( clearly , `` short '' and `` long '' depend in the details of the particular time series . ) other advantages of using temporally weighted fitting with moving windows over the regular mf - dfa are that the approximated profile is continuous across windows , reducing spurious slope changes at longer time scales , and while mf - dfa can only produce time scales up to @xmath50 , mf - twdfa extends this to @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite outlines the many time scales in the air / sea / ice system , ranging from days to several months , associated with the interaction of the ice with the atmosphere and the ocean mixed layer , whereas time scales ranging from decades to much longer , are ascribed to the deep ocean component of the system , generally understood to be uncoupled from ice drift and surface currents .",
    "for the central basin pack ice , the principal forces balance air and water stresses , sea surface tilt , and the coriolis effect @xcite . based on 2 years of data",
    "@xcite concluded that on time scales of days to months , more than 70% of the variance of the ice motion can be explained by the geostrophic winds .    in figure",
    "[ fig : arctic_pressure_ds ] we plot the fluctuation function for arctic sea ice and geostrophic wind velocities in _",
    "x- _ and _ y- _ directions without the seasonal cycle , for the period 1978 - 2012 and 1978 - 2006 respectively .",
    "the match of the fluctuation functions for the sea ice velocity and the geostrophic wind is excellent up to characteristic ( crossover ) time scales of several years .",
    "this demonstrates that the high correlation between the winds and the ice velocity concluded by @xcite is extended from months to years , and that this correlation persists over climatological time scales .",
    "previously we showed that when the seasonal cycle is removed from the eie over the 32 year period ( 1978 - 2010 ) , it exhibits a white noise dynamical behavior on annual to bi - annual time scales @xcite . here , we extend the analysis of the eie without the seasonal cycle and examine it in progressive periods ; 1978 - 1980 , 1978 - 1981 , and 1978 - 2014 .",
    "this analysis confirms the presence of white noise structure as a robust signal on annual to bi - annual time scales . finally , the data from a hybridized data set from 1901 - 2014 compiled by walsh and chapman @xcite also shows white noise structure on these time scales .",
    "thus , for such a robust signal to exist , the physical mechanism responsible for it must be stationary .    to further pursue the robustness of the statistics , we calculate the correlation between the components of sea ice velocity , @xmath52 parallel or perpendicular to a line joining two points separated by a distance @xmath53 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the spatial autocorrelation in both the parallel and perpendicular directions for 2 years of data ( 1979 - 80 ) ( from * ?",
    "* ) and for 34 years of data ( 1978 - 2012 ) are shown in figure [ fig : arctic_velocitycorr ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : ice_shear ] we compare the spatial autocorrelation functions in the shear for the ice velocity and the geostrophic wind field for the period 1979 - 1980 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with that for 1979 - 2006 .",
    "these demonstrate a striking three decade stationarity in the key correlations underlying the structure of the velocity field of pack ice .",
    "finally , we use the entire 34 year record to calculate the mean speed of each pixel every day of the year .",
    "this mean is computed using a specified threshold , @xmath54 , i.e. , if a pixel has contained sea ice for @xmath54 years , where the maximum @xmath54 is 34 years .",
    "thus , thresholds specify a minimum time for which a pixel contained ice @xcite .",
    "these are then used to produce a histogram for each day of the year for the sea ice speed , with each bin representing the number of pixels having the corresponding speed .",
    "these histograms are then normalized in order to compare between different thresholds .",
    "figure [ fig : arctic_velocitythreshold](a ) shows the normalized histograms for january 1 .",
    "the left histogram is for @xmath55 year , and the right histogram is for @xmath56 .",
    "next , for each day of the year we compute the difference in the two histograms , calculate the area under the curve , and plot this in figure [ fig : arctic_velocitythreshold](b ) for different thresholds from @xmath57 , with respect to @xmath56 .    the change in the area as the threshold @xmath54 is increased",
    "is negligible , with the maximum variability appearing during the summer , as expected due to the typical seasonality of free drift .",
    "moreover , when we subtract the running mean with a window size of 7 days from all the curves , and plot the residuals , the curves for all thresholds collapse ( lower curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : arctic_velocitythreshold]b ) .",
    "finally , when we analyze the residuals with the mf - twdfa methodology , we extract the weather time scale of 10 days and an approximately 47 day time scale , associated with the high variability during the summer as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : arctic_velocitythreshold](b ) .",
    "these results further demonstrate the stationarity of the arctic sea ice velocity fields .",
    "we therefore ascribe the white noise structure of the eie to that of the velocity field .",
    "the multiple time scales of arctic sea ice motion vectors extracted from the multifractal analysis have been described in  [ sec : disc ] . in all cases",
    ", we can attribute the @xmath58 5 day time scale to the relaxation time scale for synoptic fluctuations in the sea ice motion @xcite .",
    "when the seasonal cycle is not removed , the only time scales are due to synoptic scale weather and the seasonal cycle itself . when the seasonal cycle is removed , the slope of the fluctuation curves demonstrate that a white noise process operates on time scales @xmath59 60 days .",
    "the data motivate a stochastic treatment of the ice motion , which for simplicity of illustration we write for the @xmath60-component of the velocity vector as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the daily average ice velocity component , @xmath63 is the relaxation time scale , @xmath64 is the frequency of the seasonal cycle , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the strengths of the respective forcings .",
    "figure [ fig : lngvncompare ] shows the model to be in excellent agreement with the observations for time periods of days to decades . from periods of months to decades the dynamics is ostensibly white and thus the variance of the ice velocity is quasi - stationary .",
    "this is the key point , as the comparison is robust for reasonable changes in the model parameters ( e.g. , @xmath67 ranging from 2 to 6 days ) .",
    "however , the model is a minimal one and by considering a variety of other effects , such as multiplicative noise in combination with the periodic forcing , the potential for a stochastic resonance arises @xcite , which might produce behavior not found in the observational record .",
    "however , it is the observations themselves , with their long term stationarity , that motivate the simplicity of the model and thus its utility .",
    "using a variety of stochastic analysis approaches we examined approximately three decades of data and demonstrate the stationary structure of the correlation between sea ice motion and geostrophic winds . with two years of data , @xcite showed that on time scales of days to months , more than 70% of the variance of the ice motion can be explained solely by the geostrophic winds . over climatological time scales ,",
    "we find a striking robustness of this conclusion , which extends from days to years , and thus is most likely associated with the prevalence of free drift as the ice cover has declined ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the ice motion field exhibits a white noise structure that explains that found in the equivalent ice extent over the same three and a half decade period .",
    "this is due to the long - term stationarity of the spatial correlation structure of the velocity fields . finally , using a periodically forced stochastic model",
    ", we can explain the combination of time scales that underlie the observed persistent structure of the velocity field and the forcing that produces it .",
