    "the dual meissner effect due to condensation of color magnetic monopoles is conjectured to be the color confinement mechanism in qcd .",
    "we consider qcd after abelian projection@xcite .",
    "the abelian projection of qcd is to extract an abelian theory performing a partial gauge - fixing .",
    "a gauge called maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge is interesting among many abelian projections@xcite .",
    "the string tension can be reproduced from residual abelian link variables@xcite . moreover ,",
    "the string tension is explained by monopole contributions alone@xcite as in compact qed @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is 1 )  to show that the string tension is explained by monopole contribution alone also in finite - temperature @xmath0 qcd , 2 )  to study the spatial string tension both in the confinement and in the deconfinement phases and 3 )  to study what kind of monopole loops are responsible for the physical and the spatial string tensions .",
    "we adopt the usual @xmath0 wilson action and choose the maximally abelian gauge in which diagonal components of all link variables are maximized .",
    "gauge fixed link variables are decomposed into a product of two matrices : where @xmath2 is diagonal abelian gauge field .",
    "an abelian wilson loop operator is given by a product of monopole and photon contributions@xcite .",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 is a forward ( backward ) derivative on the lattice , @xmath6 is an external current taking @xmath7 along the wilson loop and @xmath8 is an antisymmetric variable as @xmath9 also @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angle variable defined from @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the lattice coulomb propagator and a monopole current @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 following degrand - toussaint@xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is the photon ( the monopole ) contribution to the abelian wilson loop . to study the features of both contributions",
    ", we calculated the expectation values of @xmath17 ( called abelian ) , of @xmath18 ( photon part ) and of @xmath19 ( monopole part ) , separately .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations were performed on @xmath20 lattice at @xmath21 .",
    "all measurements were done every 50 sweeps after a thermalization of 2000 sweeps .",
    "we took 50 configurations totally for measurements . assuming the static potential is given by linear + coulomb + constant terms",
    ", we tried to determine the potential by the creutz ratios using the least square fit .",
    "the data are shown in fig .",
    "we calculated the physical string tension and the spatial string tension .",
    "the latter is given by wilson loops composed of only spatial link variables .",
    "in the confinement phase , both string tensions from the abelian wilson loops show the same value as that in ( @xmath22 ) @xmath0 qcd , which is also the same as the full string tension@xcite .",
    "moreover , the physical string tension vanishes at the critical coupling @xmath23 .",
    "however , the spatial string tension does not vanish and remains finite even in the deconfinement phase .",
    "both physical and spatial string tensions from the monopoles almost agree with those from the abelian wilson loops in the confinement phase . in the deconfinement phase ,",

    "= 0.4    = 0.4",
    "it is believed that , at high temperature , four dimensional qcd can be regarded through dimensional reduction as an effective three dimensional qcd with @xmath25 as a higgs field@xcite . in this effective theory ,",
    "the spatial string tension is expected to obey @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the four dimensional coupling constant .",
    "the scaling properties of the spatial string tension derived from the usual full wilson loops is confirmed recently in monte - carlo simulations of @xmath0 qcd@xcite .    to check if the same thing happens in the abelian case , we performed additional monte - carlo simulations varying both @xmath28 and @xmath29 on @xmath30 lattices following bali et al.@xcite .",

    "@xmath34 is independent of @xmath29 and so the spatial string tension is expected to be a physical quantity remaining in the continuum limit .",
    "the spatial string tension from the monopoles is also @xmath29 independent , and is a little bit lower , but shows almost the same behavior .",
    "= 0.4    = 0.4",
    "the features of the abelian monopole currents were studied in @xcite through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "they obtained the followings : 1 ) in the confinement phase , there is one long monopole loop in each configuration .",
    "2 ) in the deconfinement phase , long monopole loops disappear .",
    "all monopole loops are short .",
    "these results bring us an idea that the long monopole current plays an important role in the string tension , because the physical string tension exists only in the confinement phase and vanishes in the deconfinement phase .",
    "we investigated contributions from the longest monopole loops and from all other monopole loops to the string tension separately .",

    "the short loop contributions are almost zero .",
    "only a few percent of the total links are occupied by monopole currents belonging to the long loop .",
    "nevertheless , it gives rise to the full value of the string tension .",
    "next , we consider the case of the spatial string tension at high temperature . the static ( wrapped ) monopole , which closes by periodicity of the time direction , is expected to be important for the spatial string tension , because , in three dimensional su(2 ) qcd with a higgs field , the confinement mechanism is explained by an instanton @xcite , and this instanton is a static monopole in terms of four dimensional qcd at high temperature .",
    "we calculated the contributions from the wrapped loops and the non - wrapped loops to the string tension separately .",
