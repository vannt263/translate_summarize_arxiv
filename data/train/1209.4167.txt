    "as an extension of traditional cavity - quantum - electro - dynamics @xcite , the resonant coupling of a cavity to an ensemble of two - level systems has received considerable interest for the past three decades . in particular , by the collective effect of @xmath0 particles , the otherwise weak single - particle coupling is enhanced by a factor of @xmath1 @xcite . in experiment , this has allowed for reaching the collective strong - coupling regime in atomic @xcite , ionic @xcite , and solid - state implementations @xcite , typically materializing as a normal - mode splitting of the coupled radiation - matter system .",
    "ensembles of electronic spins coupled to a micro - wave cavity have recently been considered for quantum - memory purposes @xcite .",
    "however , such ensembles usually contain an inherent inhomogeneity of the spin transition frequencies , which leads to dephasing of the stored information .",
    "while spin - refocusing techniques reverse this process , it is necessary to understand the dynamical effects and stability of an inverted ensemble coupled to a cavity - field mode to benefit from such refocusing processes .",
    "this is the topic of the present manuscript .",
    "we demonstrate , in particular , that the inhomogeneity of the spin transition frequencies is an advantage in the sense that it plays a stabilizing role for an inverted ensemble .",
    "dynamical effects will be examined for both mean values and second moments , and a stability criterion for an inverted sample is derived .",
    "our analysis applies in general for any large collection of two - level systems , but for convenience we shall use the terminology and notation of ensembles of spin-@xmath2 particles .",

    "the holstein - primakoff approximation corresponds to keeping the collective spin vector within the linear region around the north or south pole of a collective bloch sphere .",
    "relaxing the need for perfect polarization corresponds to merely reducing the radius of the collective bloch vector .",
    "we note that the important equations include @xmath228 and @xmath48 in the combination @xmath229 , and since @xmath230 it is reasonable that a non - perfect spin polarization is accounted for by this combination .",

    "this holds simultaneously for the mean values and variances of the cavity field .",
    "the details of the spin - cavity dynamics was discussed for a lorentzian and a gaussian inhomogeneity in the spin - resonance frequencies . in particular ,",

    "the present appendix describes how the holstein - primakoff approximation is applied to establish numerically tractable , linear equations of motion for the mean values and second moments of field and collective spin quadrature operators .",
    "the system hilbert space is infinite dimensional even for a single oscillator mode ; however , the number of equations we need to solve scales only linearly and quadratically with the number of modes for mean values and second moments , respectively . in order to handle inhomogeneities numerically , the ensemble is divided into @xmath231 sub - ensembles , @xmath232 , which can each be regarded as homogeneous with coupling strength @xmath171 , spin resonance frequency @xmath172 , and containing @xmath233 spins for @xmath234 .",

    "the last term in each equation is a langevin noise operator , the properties of which follow from the quantum langevin equations of a damped harmonic oscillator @xcite .",

    "( [ heis - y ] ) yields the mean value equation for @xmath254 : @xmath255 this is the equation solved in our numerical mean field analysis , and it is the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath249 which govern the stability of the solutions . the heisenberg equations for the fluctuations around the mean values @xmath256 are operator valued , and to investigate the fluctuations",
    "numerically we introduce the @xmath257 covariance matrix @xmath258 with elements @xmath259 , which represent the quantum correlations between any two of the @xmath260 relevant operators , @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",

    "the sub - ensemble grouping of spins serves two purposes .",
    "most importantly , it enables the application of the holstein - primakoff approximation , which results in linear coupled equations for the first and second moments of effective oscillator quadrature operators .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of dynamical variables accounting for the full quantum state to @xmath269 mean values and @xmath270 second moments with @xmath231 being the number sub - ensembles . for the validity and accuracy of our approach",
    "one should ensure that @xmath231 is large enough to adequately represent the inhomogeneous broadening of the spin ensemble , i.e. , the frequency spacing must be sufficiently small to avoid discretization errors such as artificial revivals of the spin state , while still treating a sufficiently large number of spins to render the holstein - primakoff oscillator description valid .",
    "although we treat the collective @xmath271 operators as constants equal to @xmath272 , the validity of the holstein - primakoff approximations merely relies on their mean values being much larger than their quantum fluctuations .",
    "our analysis will thus also apply for partly polarized samples , and we may revisit the full heisenberg equations of motion in order to determine if they change in time due to the coupling to the cavity field . to this end , consider the time derivative of @xmath273 : @xmath274 in the case of a seeded cavity , studied in sec .",
