    "time - distance helioseismology @xcite constructs wave packets by cross - correlating time signals between any two points separated by a fixed horizontal angular distance on the solar surface .",
    "it then measures their travel time between the two points , by fitting a gabor wavelet to the observed temporal cross - correlation @xcite .",
    "this travel time is then inverted to study different properties @xcite ( e.g. sound speed perturbations , subsurface flows , meridional circulation ) in the solar interior that influence the wave packet , which can not otherwise be studied by the global oscillations .",
    "the success in applying the technique depends on being able to design a phase speed filter of a certain width , that selects acoustic waves within a certain range of horizontal phase speeds , and this improves the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "waves with the same horizontal phase speed travel the same horizontal distance on the solar surface , and therefore can be collectively used to probe the sub - surface features in the sun , since they sample the same vertical depth inside the sun .",
    "the filtering operation is carried out in the frequency domain , and it improves the signal - to - noise ratio by removing unwanted signals and waves that deviate a lot from the chosen phase speed , as these do not contribute to the cross - correlation , but instead can degrade it , and make the estimation of travel times inaccurate .",
    "the phase speed filter has a gaussian shape centered at the desired phase speed , which is chosen to study waves traveling a particular horizontal distance .",
    "previous approaches to measuring the travel time between any two points was by fitting a gabor wavelet @xcite to the measured cross correlation .",
    "this wavelet was derived by assuming that the amplitude of the solar oscillations has a gaussian envelope in frequency of a certain width and peaked at a frequency where the power of the solar p - modes is concentrated , and moreover it considered only the radial component of the displacement . however , during data processing a phase speed filter is used . also , the observed displacement on the solar surface has both radial and horizontal components .",
    "the horizontal component usually is ignored in the travel - time measurements .",
    "we show that it has a significant effect , particularly , for measurements far from the disk center and for moderate horizontal distances , contributing to systematic errors .    to remove the shortcomings ,",
    "we derive a new analytical cross - correlation wavelet that incorporates the phase speed filter , and also includes both the radial and horizontal components of the doppler velocity oscillation signal .",
    "this wavelet retains the structure of the gabor wavelet , and is a function of the filter parameters : central phase speed and width , and also on the amplitude , phase and group travel times that depend on the oscillation properties and the dispersive nature of the solar medium . by including the horizontal component in the cross - correlation",
    "we also see a dependency on the location of the two points being cross - correlated , and moreover , the cross - correlation due to the horizontal component is a weighted sum of phase speed filtered gabor wavelets , with the weights depending on the location of the cross - correlated points , the horizontal travel distance and the angular degree .    comparing this with the original gabor wavelet formula @xcite",
    "we can estimate how the phase - speed filter and the horizontal component shift the measured travel times .",
    "for the line depth and intensity observations , that only have a scalar ( radial ) component , in the weakly dispersive limit which is true for wave packets that probe the deeper layers in the sun and travel large horizontal distances on the solar surface , corresponding to small values of angular degree both formulae are similar .",
    "hence , using the old gabor wavelet in this regime should not effect the travel time measurements due to the phase speed filtering . on the other hand , wave packets constructed by cross - correlating time signals separated by a small horizontal distance ,",
    "are distorted by the dispersive medium in the outer layers of the sun , and , hence , the new formula should be used to account for the travel time shifts due to the phase - speed filtering procedure .",
    "in this section , we generalize the fitting formula of @xcite by including the phase - speed filtering .",
    "we first consider acoustic waves , that are observed by measuring either intensity fluctuations or line depth observations on the solar surface .",
    "they are represented as a sum of standing waves or normal modes at a point @xmath0 in the solar interior and time @xmath1 , and can be written as @xmath2 where , @xmath3 , and each normal mode is specified by a 3-tuple @xmath4 of integer parameters , corresponding angular frequency @xmath5 , the mode amplitude @xmath6 , the phase @xmath7 and the spatial eigenfunction @xmath8 as a function of the radial variable @xmath9 and the angular variables @xmath10 .",
    "the integer @xmath11 denotes the degree and @xmath12 the azimuthal order , @xmath13 , of the spherical harmonic @xmath14 which is a function of the co - latitude @xmath15 and longitude @xmath16 . here",
    ", @xmath17 is a legendre function , and @xmath18 is a normalization constant . these describe the angular structure of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the third integer @xmath19 of the 3-tuple @xmath4 is called the radial order .    for a spherically symmetric sun",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath20 can be separated into a radial function @xmath21 and an angular component @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this representation is valid for example for the scalar intensity observations , @xmath23 and also all modes with the same @xmath19 and @xmath11 have the same eigenfrequency @xmath24 , regardless of the value of @xmath12 . in reality",
    "the sun is not spherically symmetric , that causes this degeneracy in @xmath12 to be broken .    in time - distance helioseismology",
    "we measure the travel time of wave packets by forming a temporal cross - correlation between the oscillation signals at two locations separated by an angular distance on the solar surface @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the solar radius . to model",
    "this we represent the solar oscillations on the solar surface as a linear superposition of normal modes , that are band - limited in angular frequency @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the temporal fourier transform @xcite of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we ignore mode damping and assume spherical symmetry , hence we can replace @xmath5 by @xmath24 and invoke the band - limited nature of the solar spectrum , @xcite , by setting @xmath30 , and we obtain from equation ( [ eq4 ] ) the frequency band - limited signal @xmath31 @xmath32 where , the gaussian frequency function @xmath33 captures the band - limited nature of the amplitude of the solar modes , and is given by @xmath34 the band - limited nature of the modes is controlled by the width @xmath35 , and a central frequency @xmath36 , where the power of the modes is peaked in the @xmath37 diagram .",
    "these two parameters change for different data sets , that probe different regions of the solar interior .",
    "a phase speed filter is applied to the signal to select modes from the @xmath37 diagram for the purpose of constructing the cross - correlation wave packet .",
    "the phase speed filter is specified by a gaussian centered around a phase speed @xmath38 and a width @xmath39 as parameters , and is given by @xmath40 where , the phase speed @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the horizontal wave number .",

    "all these waves travel almost the same horizontal distance on the solar surface , and sample approximately the same vertical depth in the solar interior .",
    "hence , it is crucial to select @xmath39 appropriately so as to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the cross - correlation function , and hence be able to better resolve the sub - surface structures in the sun .    due to the band - limited nature of the oscillation amplitudes , only values of @xmath44 which are close to @xmath45",

    "this signal now consists of a superposition of modes that lie in a region of the @xmath37 diagram , that is the intersection region of the frequency band - limited gaussian envelope of the solar modes and the phase speed filter .",

    "the addition theorem in equation ( [ eq16 ] ) becomes @xmath89 using equation ( [ eq18a ] ) , the equation ( [ eq15 ] ) for the phase speed filtered cross - correlation becomes after taking the real part @xmath90    the double sum in equation ( [ eq19 ] ) can be reduced to a convenient sum of integrals if we regroup the modes so that the outer sum is over the phase speed @xmath91 , and the inner sum is over @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "@xmath179 in deriving this equation we used the asymptotic formula for the legendre functions , which allowed us to obtain the explicit expression for the phase shift .",
    "we verified by direct numerical calculations of the cross - covariance functions that this approximation is sufficiently accurate .",
    "a comparison of the analytical formula in equation ( [ eq36 ] ) for @xmath180 with the direct numerical mode summation is shown in figure  [ fg1 ] .",
    "this approximation holds when the travel times are much greater than the oscillation period of five minutes , which is the case for typical time - distance measurements .    from the equations ( [ eq35 ] ) and ( [ eq37 ] ) we observe that the cross - correlation of the doppler line of sight velocity involving the horizontal component of the displacement is a weighted sum of the phase speed filtered gabor wavelets , with the weights depending on the location @xmath181 of the two points being cross - correlated , and the angular degree @xmath11 of the modes .",
    "this weighted sum can be conveniently combined incorporating a phase factor into the cosine term .    from equation ( [ eq39a ] ) we see a shift in phase travel times due to the horizontal component in addition to that introduced by the phase speed filtering . in figure  [ fg2 ] , we see a variation in the travel time shift due to the horizontal component as we move point b ( see appendix e , figure   [ fg8 ] ) around the annulus by changing the angle @xmath182 ( see appendix d , figure  [ fg6 ] ) , cross correlating with the fixed point a. figure  [ fg3 ] illustrates the phase shift for the projection on the solar disk .",
    "the greatest phase shift changes happen for the outmost points in the direction from the disk center .",
    "averaging the travel time shift over the annular angle @xmath182 , for different horizontal distances @xmath65 and distances from disk center @xmath183 , to simulate the observed mean travel times , we show in figure  [ fg4 ] that this time shift increases ( becomes more negative ) as we go away from disk center and also for increasing horizontal distances .",
    "the shifts are quite appreciable , on the order of a few seconds , and have been observed in the real data from soho / mdi @xcite . at disk center c , ( see appendix e , figure  [ fg7 ] ) which according to our convention is at @xmath184 , which is the origin of the yz plane perpendicular to the line of sight direction @xmath136 . in polar coordinates the disk center is specified by @xmath185 , at which the horizontal component is zero in equation ( [ eq30 ] ) , and the radial component is maximum .",
    "we see from figure  [ fg2 ] , when point a is at disk center , the time shift is independent of @xmath182 , moreover there will always be a small travel time shift for this case since point b is at a distance @xmath65 from the disk center , and it has a non - zero horizontal component that when cross - correlated with the radial component of the signal at point a , which is at disk center , leads to a travel time shift .",
    "a dispersive medium is where the phase velocity @xmath119 is quite different from the group velocity @xmath120 @xcite . due to this for a fixed distance @xmath65 , the group and phase travel times are different . in the solar case the wave packets that travel short distances , probe the outer layers of the sun , which are quite dispersive due to the presence of large gradients . hence the wave packets got by the cross - correlation in equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) are distorted as they travel through the medium .",
    "moreover , the approximations made by retaining only the first order terms in the taylor expansion of the dispersion relation in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) may be inadequate to completely model the physical effects associated with small distances , hence care must be exercised in interpreting the results got by using these wavelets for small distances .    on the other hand , wave packets that travel large angular distances @xmath65 , probe the deeper layers of the sun , that are weakly dispersive , and",
    "hence undergo less distortion .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that the gabor wavelet in equation ( [ eq27 ] ) , in the absence of the phase speed filter is got in the non - dispersive limit of equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) when @xmath117 , that is @xmath122 , for the intensity or line depth signal which has only the radial component .",
    "this is quite intuitive since in this limit there is no phase speed filtering , and @xmath186 , hence the phase speed filtered signal in equation ( [ eq11 ] ) reduces to the frequency band - limited signal in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this is consisted both physically and mathematically . to form wave packets",
    "the medium need not be dispersive .",
    "waves in a range of frequencies and wave lengths can interfere to form a wave packet .",
    "the wave packets that travel through a dispersive medium are distorted , where as those through a non - dispersive medium are not distorted , but retain their original shape .",
    "the dimensionless quantities @xmath187 and @xmath188 measure the amount of deviation from non - dispersiveness . hence to fit the observed temporal cross - correlation for the intensity or line depth signal where , @xmath188 and @xmath187 are small",
    ", there will be little error in using the gabor wavelet of equation ( [ eq27 ] ) , since the new gabor wavelet of equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) is very close to the old gabor wavelet @xcite in this non - dispersive or weakly dispersive limit for the line depth or scalar intensity signal that have only the radial component .",
    "in this paper we introduce a mathematical formalism to deal with the horizontal component of the displacement , which is used to derive a new formula to estimate travel times in time - distance helioseismology .",
    "it models the observed cross - correlation , by considering both the radial and horizontal components of the displacement , and also includes the phase speed filter on the frequency band - limited solar oscillations .",
    "the form of the gabor wavelet is retained by the present formula , and in the non - dispersive limit for the line depth or intensity observations it reduces to the previously used gabor wavelet that was derived without a phase speed filter , considering only the radial component . including the horizontal component , the cross - correlation is a weighted sum of phase speed filtered gabor wavelets , with the weights depending on the angular position of the two points being cross - correlated , and the angular degree of the modes . due to the phase speed filtering and inclusion of the horizontal component of the displacement , shifts in phase travel times are observed . in particular , the horizontal component induces a systematic shift in travel times , whose absolute value increases as we go away from disk center and also for large horizontal distances .",
    "this will in turn have implications in the inversions to study flows and the sub - surface properties in the sun and also to formulate other local helioseismic approaches that involve the horizontal component .",

    "<S> in time - distance helioseismology , the time signals ( doppler shifts ) at two points on the solar surface , separated by a fixed angular distance are cross - correlated , and this leads to a wave packet signal . accurately measuring the travel times of these wave packets </S>",
    "<S> is crucial for inferring the sub - surface properties in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the observed signal is quite noisy , and to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and make the cross - correlation more robust , the temporal oscillation signal is phase - speed filtered at the two points in order to select waves that travel a fixed horizontal distance . </S>",
    "<S> hence a new formula to estimate the travel times is derived , in the presence of a phase speed filter , and it includes both the radial and horizontal component of the oscillation displacement signal . </S>",
    "<S> it generalizes the previously used gabor wavelet that was derived without a phase speed filter and included only the radial component of the displacement . </S>",
    "<S> this is important since it will be consistent with the observed cross - correlation that is computed using a phase speed filter , and also it accounts for both the components of the displacement . </S>",
    "<S> the new formula depends on the location of the two points on the solar surface that are being cross correlated and accounts for the travel time shifts at different locations on the solar surface . </S>"
