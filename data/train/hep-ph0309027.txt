    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the predicted running of @xmath6 from @xmath7-pole to low energy : @xmath8 , has never been established experimentally to a high precision .",
    "@xmath9 can be obtained through the @xmath7-pole precision measurements with very small error . however , no determination of @xmath6 at low energy with similar precision is available .",
    "more recently , the results of cesium atomic parity - violation ( apv ) @xcite and @xmath4- ( @xmath10- ) nucleus deep inelastic scattering ( dis)@xcite have been interpreted as determinations of the scale - dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "the cesium apv result appears to be consistent with the sm prediction for @xmath11 , whereas the neutrino dis measurement implies a @xmath12 deviation at @xmath13 @xmath14 . if conventional hadron structure effects are ultimately unable to account for the nutev ",
    "anomaly \" , the results of this precision measurement would point to new physics .    in light of this situation ,",
    "two new measurements involving polarized electron scattering have taken on added interest : parity - violating ( pv ) mller ( @xmath15 ) scattering at slac@xcite and elastic , pv @xmath16 scattering at the jefferson lab ( jlab)@xcite . in the absence of new physics , both measurements could be used to determine @xmath6 at the same scale : @xmath17 @xmath14 , with comparable precision in each case : @xmath18 . furthermore , the precision needed to probe new physics effects , e.g. supersymmetry ( susy ) , is roughly an order of magnitude less stringent , owing to a fortuitous suppression of the sm electron and proton weak charge : @xmath19 at tree - level .",
    "consequently , experimental precision of order a few percent , rather than a few tenths of a percent , is needed to probe new physics corrections .",
    "the goal of our study is to develop consistency check for theories of new physics using the low energy neutral current scattering measurements . in particular",
    ", we will consider the minimal supersymmetric extension of sm ( mssm)@xcite , which is the most promising candidate for new physics beyond sm .",
    "for @xmath20-parity conserved mssm , low - energy precision observables experience susy only via loop effects involving virtual supersymmetric particles .",
    "tree level corrections appear once @xmath20-parity is broken explicitly .",
    "we studies both the pv electron scattering ( pves ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath21)-nucleus dis processes . details of the calculations presented here can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the weak charge of a particle @xmath22 is defined as the strength of the effective @xmath23 interaction : @xmath24 . with higher - order corrections",
    "included , the weak charge can be written as @xmath25+\\lambda_f $ ] .",
    "the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 are universal , while the correction @xmath28 , on the other hand , does depend on the fermion species . at tree - level , one has @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while at one - loop order @xmath31 , and similar formulae apply to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    the counterterm @xmath32 determined by muon life time and the @xmath33 boson self - energy are combined into @xmath26 ( expressed in terms of the oblique parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xcite ) : @xmath36 the quantity @xmath37 denotes the the electroweak vertex , external leg , and box graph corrections to the muon decay amplitude .    @xmath38 mixing and parity - violating electron - photon coupling @xmath39 contribute to @xmath27 : @xmath40 + \\bigl({{\\hat c}^2\\over { \\hat c}^2-{\\hat s}^2 } \\bigr)\\bigl[-{{\\hat\\pi}_{\\gamma\\gamma}(m_z^2)\\over m_z^2 } + { \\delta{\\hat\\alpha}\\over \\alpha } \\bigr]+4{\\hat c}^2 f_a^{e}(q^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the shift @xmath41 in @xmath42 follows from the definition of @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the non - universal contribution @xmath28 to the weak charge is determined by the sum of the the renormalized vertex corrections and the box graphs .",
    "in order to evaluate the potential size of susy loop corrections , a set of about 3000 different combinations of susy - breaking parameters was generated .",
    "[ fig : apv_nutev](a ) shows the shift in the weak charge of the proton , @xmath46 , versus the corresponding shift in the electron s weak charge , @xmath47 , normalized to the respective sm values .",
    "the corrections in the mssm ( with @xmath20-parity conserved ) can be as large as @xmath48 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath0 )  roughly the size of the proposed experimental errors for the two pves measurements .",
    "the shifts @xmath50 are dominated by @xmath51 , which is nearly always negative , corresponding to a reduction in the value of @xmath52 for the pves experiments .",
    "since this effect is identical for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the dominant effect of @xmath53 produces a linear correlation between the two weak charges .    as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : apv_nutev ] ( a ) , the relative sign of the loop corrections to both @xmath1 and @xmath0 is nearly always the same and positive .",
    "this correlation is significant , since the effects of other new physics scenarios can display different signatures .",
    "for example , for the general class of theories based on @xmath54 gauge group , with neutral gauge bosons @xmath55 having mass @xmath56 gev , the effects on @xmath1 and @xmath0 also correlate , but @xmath57 can have either sign in this case@xcite .",
    "in contrast , leptoquark interactions would not lead to discernible effects in @xmath0 but could induce sizable shifts in @xmath1 @xcite .    as a corollary",
    ", we also find that susy loop corrections to the weak charge of cesium is suppressed : @xmath58 and is equally likely to have either sign , which is smaller than the presently quoted uncertainty for the cesium nuclear weak charge of about 0.6% @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present agreement of @xmath59 with the sm prediction does not preclude significant shifts in @xmath60 arising from susy .",
    "the situation is rather different , for example , in the @xmath61 scenario , where sizable shifts in @xmath60 would also imply observable deviations of @xmath59 from the sm prediction .",
    "new tree - level susy contributions to the weak charges can be generated when the r parity in mssm is not conserved .",
    "the effects of @xmath20-parity violating ( rpv ) contribution can be parametrized by positive , semi - definite , dimensionless quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63@xcite , which are constrained from the existing precision data @xcite .",
    "the 95% cl region allowed in the @xmath64 vs. @xmath65 plane is shown by the closed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : apv_nutev ] ( a ) .",
    "we observe that the prospective effects of rpv are quite distinct from susy loops .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is never positive in contrast to the situation for susy loop effects , whereas @xmath64 can have either sign .",
    "thus , a comparison of the two pves measurements could help determine which extension of the mssm is to be favored over other new physics scenarios @xcite .",
    "recently , the nutev collaboration has performed a precise determination of the ratio @xmath2 ( @xmath66 ) of neutral and charged current deep - inelastic @xmath67 ( @xmath68)-nucleus cross sections@xcite , which can be expressed in terms of the effective @xmath69 hadronic couplings @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 . comparing the sm predictions@xcite for @xmath70 with the values obtained by the nutev collaboration yields deviations @xmath73 ,",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 .    the numerical results for susy contributions to @xmath2 and @xmath66 via the correction to the effective hadronic couplings @xmath70 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apv_nutev ] ( b ) . for detailed analysis ,",
    "see ref .",
    "susy loop contributions to @xmath2 and @xmath66 are smaller than the observed deviations . more significantly , the sign of the susy loop corrections is nearly always positive , in contrast to the sign of the nutev anomaly .",
    "tree - level rpv contributions to @xmath2 and @xmath66 are by and large positive",
    ". while small negative corrections are also possible , they are numerically too small to be interesting .",
    "in summary , we have studied the susy corrections to the weak charge of the electron and proton , which could be measured at pv @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering experiments .",
    "the correlation between these two quantities could be used to distinguish various new physics .",
    "we also examined the susy contributions to the nutev measurements and found that it is hard to explain the nutev anomaly in the framework of mssm ."
