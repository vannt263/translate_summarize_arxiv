    "such a low - energy effective theory can be written down based on the systematic derivative expansion guided by the symmetries of the system . typically , the hydrodynamic variables are the fluctuations of the conserved charges , the order parameter associated with the critical phenomena , and the nambu - goldstone modes associated with spontaneous breaking of some symmetries .    near the high - density qcd critical point ,",

    "the hydrodynamic variables ( i)(iii ) above are the same as those of the high - temperature qcd critical point @xcite , but here we have the additional hydrodynamic variable ( iv ) due to the nuclear / quark superfluids .",

    "finally , we remark that the dynamic critical exponent @xmath66 obtained above is not affected by nonlinear couplings beyond the mean field .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that what is renormalized by nonlinear terms is the kinetic coefficient @xcite and that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs2 ] ) does not depend on any kinetic coefficient .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of the high - temperature qcd critical point , where the dynamic critical exponent is modified by nonlinear couplings @xcite .",
    "this is because the hydrodynamic mode that exhibits the critical slowing down there is the diffusion mode , whose diffusion rate depends on a kinetic coefficient .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the high - density qcd critical point belongs to the new dynamic universality class that is beyond the conventional classification by hohenberg and halperin .",
    "we have demonstrated that the speed of the superfluid phonon vanishes as the critical point is approached and that the dynamic critical index is @xmath0 .",
    "the physical reason why the dynamic universality class of the high - density qcd critical point is new can be understood as follows .",
    "first , it is different from that of the high - temperature qcd critical point ( i.e. , model h @xcite ) due to the presence of the superfluid phonon associated with the @xmath3 symmetry breaking .",
    "second , it must also be different from that of the superfluid transition of @xmath185he despite the presence of superfluid phonons in both cases .",
    "this is because the former criticality is characterized by the vanishing chiral order parameter ( with a nonzero superfluid gap ) , while the latter is characterized by the vanishing superfluid gap ( or vanishing stiffness constant).he , the speed of superfluid phonon is given by @xmath186 @xcite , where @xmath187 is the stiffness constant and @xmath188 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "when the superfluid transition is approached ( i.e. , when the correlation length diverges , @xmath189 ) , the stiffness constant goes to zero as @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "[ here @xmath162 and @xmath192 are the critical exponents of @xmath188 and @xmath69 , defined as @xmath193 and @xmath194 with @xmath195 . ] in particular , the @xmath69 dependence of @xmath196 is different from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) , because the high - density qcd critical point is away from the superfluid transition and the stiffness parameter @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) remains _",
    "nonvanishing_. ]    our results suggest that , while the static critical phenomena _ can not _ distinguish between the high - temperature and high - density qcd critical points , the dynamic critical phenomena _ can _ distinguish between the two",
    ". it would be important to study possible phenomenological consequences and experimental signatures of the high - density critical point to be tested in future heavy ion collision experiments , similarly to the high - temperature one @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of the dynamic critical phenomena around the high - density qcd critical point , if observed , would provide indirect evidence of the superfluidity in high - density qcd matter .",
