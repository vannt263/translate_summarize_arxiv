    "properties of the quadrupole - collective isovector excitations of the valence shell of heavy nuclei reflect three main aspects : collectivity , shell structure , and the isospin degree of freedom .",
    "the balance between these aspects has been studied within a series of experiments on so - called mixed - symmetry ( ms ) states .",
    "there is a rather complete list of references on that subject in review  @xcite .",
    "these isovector excitations were predicted in the proton - neutron version of the interacting boson model ( ibm-2 )  @xcite , where the proton - neutron symmetry of the wave functions is quantified by the bosonic analog of isospin , f spin  @xcite . in particular , there are the symmetric states with maximum f - spin ( @xmath3 ) and the ms ones with @xmath4 .",
    "one of the well - known examples is the ms quadrupole state with @xmath5 in the nucleus @xmath6mo which was indentified by the measured strong @xmath2 transitions and weakly - collective @xmath7 transitions to low - lying symmetric states  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case for @xmath6mo , the next lighter even - even @xmath8 isotone , @xmath9zr has the proton subshell closure @xmath10 and the collectivity of the @xmath11 state decreases . as a result , the collective ms structure and the structures showing the considerable f - spin breaking",
    "have been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity makes the ms states highly appealing objects for studies in microscopic approaches .",
    "the results of the large - scale shell - model calculations  @xcite have indicated the occurrence of ms quadrupole states in @xmath6mo , @xmath9zr and the breaking of f - spin symmetry in @xmath9zr . for the case of @xmath6mo , the wave functions , the @xmath2 and @xmath7 matrix elements support the ms assignments for the @xmath12 state and the consistency with the ibm-2 predictions proves the collective character of the observed low - lying levels . for @xmath9zr ,",
    "the calculated @xmath13 states are predominantly the pure neutron and isovector excitations , respectively .",
    "this means that the single particle and collective degrees of freedom are present in the low - energy spectrum .",
    "an alternative powerful microscopic approach is the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )  @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian is diagonalized in a space spanned by states composed of one , two and three phonons which are generated in quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "the separable form of the residual interaction is the practical advantage of the qpm which allows one to perform the structure calculations in large configurational spaces . for @xmath6mo",
    ", the qpm confirms the ibm-2 level scheme , selection rules and , in particular , the dominant one - phonon structure of the transitions to the first and third @xmath14 states  @xcite .",
    "also , the qpm gives a satisfactory and comprehensive description of the large variety of data measured for @xmath9zr  @xcite .",
    "the qpm wave functions of the two lowest @xmath14 states are dominated by the lowest neutron and proton two - quasiparticle components and the structures are very similar to results of the shell model calculations .",
    "thus , the qpm can provide a microscopic support to the ibm-2 scheme .",
    "however , it is difficult to extrapolate the model parameters to new regions of nuclei .",
    "the properties of ms states are particularly sensitive to the proton - neutron interaction  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominance of the proton - neutron attraction is one of the main characteristics of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "it can be traced back to the cooperation of its @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels .",
    "this is a good possibility to examine microscopic approaches using effective nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "one of the successful tools for nuclear structure studies is the qrpa with the skyrme interaction  @xcite .",
    "these qrpa calculations allow to relate the properties of the ground states and excited states through the same energy density functional .",
    "although such an approach describes the properties of the low - lying states less accurately than more phenomenological ones , the results are still in a reasonable agreement with experimental data , in particular , with respect to qualitative features of the properties of the @xmath11 states of predominantly one - phonon excitations , see for example  @xcite .    the complexity of calculations taking into account the coupling between one - phonon and more complex states increases rapidly with the size of the configurational space .",
    "making use of the finite rank separable approximation ( frsa ) @xcite for the residual interaction enables one to perform qrpa calculations in very large two - quasiparticle spaces . taking into account the basic qpm ideas , the approach has been generalized to take into account the coupling between one- and two - phonon components of the wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the frsa has been used to study the electric low - lying states and giant resonances within the qrpa and beyond  @xcite .",
    "alternative schemes to factorize the residual interaction have also been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    before to investigate the occurrence of ms states in neutron - rich nuclei one needs to be sure that the approach is sufficiently good to reproduce characteristics of the low - energy spectrum of quadrupole excitations of nuclei in the mass range @xmath17 , in particular , the @xmath2 transitions between the excitations .",
    "this initial paper gives an illustration of our approach for @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo in comparison to the @xmath18 isotones @xmath19zr , @xmath9mo with closed neutron shell .",
    "preliminary results of our studies for @xmath6mo are reported already in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we sketch the method allowing to consider the phonon - phonon coupling . in particular , the qrpa equations in the case of the finite rank separable form of the residual interaction are discussed in sec .",
    "iia . the coupling between one- and two - phonon terms in the wave functions of excited states",
    "are taken into account in sec .  iib . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the details of our calculations and show how this approach can be applied to treat the proton - neutron mixed - symmetry states .",
    "results of our calculations for properties of the quadrupole states in @xmath0zr , @xmath1mo are given in sec.iv .",
    "iva is devoted to qrpa analysis , while the effects of the phonon - phonon coupling are discussed in sec .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in sec .",
    "this method has already been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ; hence , let us briefly summarize the different steps .",
    "for the present study , the anharmonicity of the low - energy vibrations is constrained by the coupling between one- and two - phonon terms in the wave functions of excited states .",
    "the starting point of the method is the hf - bcs calculation  @xcite of the ground state , where spherical symmetry is imposed on the quasiparticle wave functions .",
    "the continuous part of the single - particle spectrum is discretized by diagonalizing the skyrme hf hamiltonian on a harmonic oscillator basis . as effective interactions , skyrme interaction",
    "are used in the particle - hole ( p - h ) channel , and the pairing correlations are generated by a density - dependent zero - range force @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the particle density in coordinate space ; @xmath22 is equal to the nuclear saturation density ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are model parameters .",
    "we use @xmath23=1 ; @xmath24= 0 , @xmath24= 0.5 , and @xmath24= 1 are the cases of a volume interaction , a mixed interaction and a surface - peaked interaction , respectively .",
    "the strength @xmath25 is fitted to reproduce the odd - even mass difference in the region of nuclei considered here . in order to limit the pairing single - particle space , we have used the smooth cutoff at 10 mev above the fermi energies  @xcite .    the residual interaction in the p - h channel @xmath26 and in the p - p channel @xmath27 can be obtained as the second derivative of the energy density functional with respect to the particle density and the pair density , accordingly . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we simplify @xmath26 by approximating it by its landau - migdal form . all landau parameters with @xmath28 are equal to zero in the case of skyrme interactions .",
    "we keep only the @xmath29 terms in @xmath26 . in this work",
    "we study only normal parity states and one can neglect the spin - spin terms since they play a minor role  @xcite .",
    "also , the two - body coulomb and spin - orbit residual interactions are dropped .",
    "therefore we can write the residual interaction as @xmath30 \\delta ( { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2)\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the channel index @xmath32 ; @xmath33 are the isospin operators , and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 standing for the fermi momentum and nucleon effective mass .",
    "the expressions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be found in ref.@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "since the definition of the pairing force  ( [ pair ] ) involves the energy cutoff of the single - particle space to restrict the active pairing space within the mean - field approximation , this cutoff is still required to eliminate the p - p matrix elements of the residual interaction in the case of the subshells that are far from the fermi energies as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the p - h matrix elements and the antisymmetrized p - p matrix elements can be written as the separable form in the angular coordinates  @xcite . after integrating over the angular variables we use a @xmath39-point integration gauss formula for the radial integrals .",
    "thus , the residual interaction can be expressed as the sum of @xmath39 terms in frsa for the skyrme residual interaction  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the phonon creation operators @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the total angular momentum and @xmath43 is its z - projection in the laboratory system .",
    "@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the quasiparticle creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath46 denote the quantum numbers @xmath47 .",
    "one assumes that the ground state is the qrpa phonon vacuum @xmath48 and the one - phonon excited states are @xmath49 with the normalization condition @xmath50 making use of the linearized equation - of - motion approach one can get the qrpa equations  @xcite .",
    "solutions of this set of linear equations yield the one - phonon energies @xmath51 and the amplitudes @xmath52 , @xmath53 of the excited states .",
    "there are two types of qrpa matrix elements : the @xmath54 matrix related to forward - going graphs and the @xmath55 matrix related to backward - going graphs , and the dimension of these matrices is the space size of the two - quasiparticle configurations . using the frsa for the residual interaction , the eigenvalues of the qrpa equations can be obtained as the roots of a relatively simple secular equation , where the matrix dimensions never exceed @xmath56 independently of the two - quasiparticle configuration space size  @xcite .",
    "the studies @xcite enable us to conclude that @xmath39=45 for the rank of our separable approximation is enough for the electric excitations ( @xmath57 ) in nuclei with @xmath58 .",
    "in the next stage , we construct the wave functions from a linear combination of one - phonon and two - phonon configurations @xmath59 _ { \\lambda \\mu } \\right)|0\\rangle .",
    "\\label{wf2ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the normalization condition @xmath60 because of the completeness and orthogonality conditions for the phonon operators , the bifermion operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be expressed by the phonon ones .",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of quasiparticle and phonon operators  @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 are determined from the variational principle @xmath65 which leads to a set of linear equations  @xcite @xmath66 @xmath67 the pauli principle corrections are dropped here since the effect on the lowest excited states is small  @xcite .",
    "the rank of the set of linear equations ( [ 2pheq1 ] ) , ( [ 2pheq2 ] ) is equal to the number of one- and two - phonon configurations included in the wave function ( [ wf2ph ] ) .",
    "its solution requires to compute the matrix elements coupling one- and two - phonon configurations @xmath68 _ { \\lambda } |0 \\rangle.\\ ] ] eqs .",
    "( [ 2pheq1 ] ) , ( [ 2pheq2 ] ) have the same form as the qpm equations  @xcite , but the single - particle spectrum and the parameters of the residual interaction are calculated with the skyrme forces .",
    "the qrpa calculations are performed without ( dashed line ) and with ( solid line ) the residual p - p interaction . ]",
    "we apply the approach to study the low - energy spectrum of @xmath14 excitations in the nuclei @xmath0zr , @xmath1mo . in our calculations",
    "the single - particle continuum is discretized by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on a basis of 12 harmonic oscillator shells and cutting off the single - particle spectra at the energy of 100  mev .",
    "this is sufficient to exhaust practically all the energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "because of the large configurational space , we do not use effective charges .",
    "the single - particle structure around the fermi level is a key ingredient in the microscopic analysis . for the investigation ,",
    "we adopt five skyrme interactions , namely , sgii  @xcite , sly4  @xcite , sly5  @xcite , sly5+t  @xcite , and t44  @xcite .",
    "the sgii parameterization is the successful attempt to describe the spin - dependent properties from a standard skyrme force . in particular , one obtains a good description of experimental energies of the gamow - teller resonance of @xmath19zr  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the forces sly4 and sly5 have been adjusted to reproduce nuclear matter properties , as well as nuclear charge radii , binding energies of doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the forces sly5+t and t44 involve the tensor terms added with ( t44 ) and without ( sly5+t ) refitting the parameters of the central interaction .",
    "these five parametrizations describe correctly the subshell order near the fermi level of @xmath0zr , @xmath1mo .",
    "to see this , the calculated neutron and proton single - particle energies for the case of @xmath9zr and the experimental data  @xcite are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the calculations with sgii reproduce well the experimental data and other choices of the skyrme forces do not improve the agreement .",
    "we employ the isospin - invariant pairing force  ( [ pair ] ) , with the value @xmath69=0.16",
    "@xmath70 of the nuclear saturation density corresponding to the sgii force .",
    "the strength @xmath25 is fitted to get a reasonable description of the experimental neutron and proton pairing energies of @xmath0zr , @xmath1mo , @xmath71 for neutrons , and similarly for protons .",
    "thus , the strength @xmath25 is taken equal to -270 mev@xmath72 , -420 mev@xmath72 , and -870 mev@xmath72 for the cases of the volume , the mixed and the surface - peaked interaction , respectively . in order to make the choice of the pairing interaction , it is very useful to analyze the three lowest two - quasiparticle states in @xmath9zr . since the @xmath73 neutron subshell",
    "is partially filled and the @xmath74 proton subshell is filled , one can expect that the first level is the @xmath75 neutron state while the second level is the @xmath76 proton one , see for example  @xcite . as it is seen from fig .",
    "2 the different choices have a strong impact on the unperturbed two - quasiparticle excitations . only the volume pairing interaction gives the @xmath76 proton state as the second level . thus",
    ", hereafter we use the skyrme interaction sgii in the particle - hole channel together with the volume zero - range force acting in the particle - particle channel .",
    "the landau parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 expressed in terms of the skyrme force parameters  @xcite depend on @xmath35 . as it is pointed out in our previous works  @xcite one",
    "needs to adopt some effective value for @xmath35 to give an accurate representation of the original p - h skyrme interaction . for the present calculations we use the value @xmath79@xmath80",
    "adjusted so as to have the spurious center - of - mass state at zero energy .",
    "it is worth to mention the effect of the residual p - p interaction within the qrpa .",
    "3 shows the effect on the @xmath13 energies and the @xmath81 values of @xmath9zr . including the quadrupole p - p interaction results in a decrease of the @xmath13 energies ( about 0.1  mev ) and",
    "the @xmath81-values do not change practically .",
    "finally , we discuss the extension of the space for one- and two - phonon configurations . to construct the wave functions  ( [ wf2ph ] ) of the low - lying @xmath14 states up to 4  mev we use only the @xmath14 phonons , and all one- and two - phonon configurations with energies up to 8  mev",
    "are included .",
    "we have checked that the inclusion of the high - energy configurations plays a minor role in our calculations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     first , properties of the low - lying quadrupole states are studied within the one - phonon approximation . results of our calculations for the @xmath13 states in @xmath0zr , @xmath1mo : the energies , the @xmath81 , @xmath82 values , and the contributions greater than 10% to the normalization conditions  ( [ phononnorm ] ) are given in table i. note that the @xmath82 values have been calculated with the @xmath83-factors of free protons and neutrons .",
    "one can see that we find a satisfactory description of the isotopic dependence of the @xmath11 energies near closed shells .",
    "the closure of the neutron subshell @xmath84 in @xmath19zr , @xmath9mo leads to the vanishing of the neutron pairing and as a result energies of the first two - quasiparticle poles , @xmath85 in @xmath19zr , @xmath9mo are larger than energies of the first poles , @xmath86 in @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo .",
    "this yields that the @xmath87 state has collective ( noncollective ) structure with the domination of the proton configuration @xmath76 for the case of @xmath19zr ( @xmath9mo ) . on the other hand , in @xmath9zr",
    "the leading neutron configuration @xmath75 gives a contribution of 79% that is almost twice larger than in @xmath6mo .",
    "the structure peculiarities are reflected in the @xmath88 values , as is shown in table i. the @xmath11 states in @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo have an isoscalar character since the dominant neutron and proton phonon amplitudes @xmath89 of the @xmath11 state are in phase .",
    "there are the second @xmath14 states in @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo below 3  mev within the one - phonon approximation .",
    "the dominant neutron and proton amplitudes of the fairly collective @xmath90 state are out of phase . as a consequence , the isovector character of the @xmath90 states",
    "are reflected in the remarkable values of @xmath91 , as given in table i. the first calculations of the isovector behavior of @xmath90 qrpa excitations in @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo based on the analysis of the phonon amplitudes within the qpm have been done in @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the structures of the @xmath90 states of @xmath19zr , @xmath9mo .",
    "the proton configurations exhaust about 99% and 56% of the wave function normalization in @xmath19zr and @xmath9mo , respectively .",
    "it means that the second pole , @xmath92 in @xmath9mo is closer to the neutron poles than that in @xmath19zr . as expected , the negligible size of the @xmath91 value of @xmath19zr is obtained .",
    "the @xmath90 state in @xmath9mo has the main neutron and proton phonon amplitudes in phase ( table i ) and this results in the comparable @xmath82 value of the @xmath2 transitions between the noncollective @xmath11 state and the isoscalar @xmath90 state .",
    "this analysis within the one - phonon approximation can help to identify the ms state , but it is only a rough estimate .",
    "some overestimate of the experimental energies ( table ii ) indicates that there is room for two - phonon effects .",
    "let us now discuss the extension of the space to one- and two - phonon configurations .",
    "the calculated @xmath14 state energies , the largest contributions of the wave function normalization  ( [ norma2ph ] ) , the @xmath81 , @xmath82 values and the experimental data  @xcite are shown in table ii .",
    "it is worth pointing out that we get the wrong energy order of the second and third @xmath14 states in the case of @xmath9zr . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy difference equal to 0.1  mev is close to the expected accuracy of our calculations .",
    "one can see that the inclusion of the two - phonon terms results in a decrease of the @xmath11 energies and in a reduction of the @xmath88 values , except for @xmath9zr .",
    "our calculations reproduce well a general behavior for energies and transition probabilities .",
    "there is some underestimation of the @xmath81 values of the n=52 isotones in comparison with the experimental data , this probably points to a particular problem due to the effective interaction rather than to a deficiency of our variational space . in all four nuclei ,",
    "the crucial contribution in the wave function structure of the first @xmath14 state comes from the @xmath93_{qrpa}$ ] configuration , but the two - phonon contributions are appreciable .",
    "this means that the structures of the first @xmath14 states do not change practically due to the effects of the phonon - phonon coupling . as a result",
    ", we get the isoscalar collective structure of the @xmath11 state in @xmath6mo and the neutron dominated @xmath11 excitation of @xmath9zr which indicates the f - spin breaking .",
    "the second @xmath94 state contains a dominant two - phonon configuration @xmath95_{qrpa}$ ] in @xmath1mo and such contribution leads to the small @xmath81 values .",
    "moreover , the calculated @xmath82 value is sensitive to the phonon composition : the two - phonon configuration composed of the isoscalar collective phonons in the case @xmath6mo and the noncollective phonons of @xmath9mo . in @xmath0zr ,",
    "the wave function of the @xmath90 state is dominated by the @xmath96_{qrpa}$ ] configuration and we can follow the qrpa estimate discussed in sec .  iva . for the case of @xmath9zr",
    "we obtain the isovector collective @xmath90 state and the dominant one - phonon structure of the @xmath2 transition between the first and second @xmath14 states in @xmath9zr .",
    "the results are close to those that were previously calculated in the shell model  @xcite and in the qpm  @xcite .",
    "finally , we examine the occurrence at low energy ( below 3 mev ) of the third @xmath14 states .",
    "one can see that the collective state in @xmath6mo is dominated by the isovector one - phonon @xmath97_{qrpa}$ ] structure .",
    "the calculated values of the @xmath12 energy and the transition probabilities are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data . in other words ,",
    "we reproduce the ibm-2 level scheme and the calculated @xmath98 value supports the ms assignments observed experimentally and theoretically for the first time in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that this conclusion for @xmath6mo remains valid for the sly5+t parameter set  @xcite . for the @xmath12 state of @xmath9zr ,",
    "one of the main components of the wave function is the @xmath95_{qrpa}$ ] configuration . as can be seen from table ii , the two - phonon contribution",
    "is reflected in the small values of the transition probabilities , but there is some overestimation in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "one can expect an improvement if the variational space is enlarged by the phonon composition with hexadecapole multipolarity and the three - phonon configurations are taken into account .",
    "such calculations are now in progress .",
    "thus the microscopic approach  @xcite describes the properties of the low - lying states in @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo less accurately than more phenomenological ones  @xcite , but the results are still in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "starting from the skyrme mean - field calculations , we have studied the effects of the phonon - phonon coupling on the properties of the low - energy spectrum of @xmath14 excitations and , in particular , on the @xmath2 transitions between the excited states of nuclei in the mass range @xmath17 .",
    "the finite - rank separable approach for the qrpa enables one to perform the calculations in very large configurational spaces .",
    "the parametrization sgii of the skyrme interaction is used for all calculations in connection with the volume zero - range pairing interaction . using the same set of parameters we have studied the behaviour of the energies , the @xmath99 and @xmath100 values of the lowest @xmath14 states in @xmath0zr , @xmath1mo . among our initial motivation",
    "was the search for ms states in @xmath9zr , @xmath6mo in comparison to the @xmath18 isotones @xmath19zr , @xmath9mo with closed neutron shell .",

    "our results from the skyrme interaction are in reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "we stress that they represent the first successful comparison between experimental @xmath2 transition values and those calculated with the skyrme interaction .",
    "the coupling between one- and two - phonon terms in the wave functions of excited states is essential .",
    "the qrpa results tend to overestimate the @xmath11 energies and the inclusion of the two - phonon configurations results in a decrease of the energies .",
    "there is a clear influence on the structure of the @xmath101 states .",
    "the structure of the low - lying @xmath94 states calculated in our approach are close to those that were calculated within the qpm before .",
    "we conclude that the present approach may provide a valuable globally applicable microscopic analysis of the properties of the lowest quadrupole excitations .    our model",
    "would probably be improved by enlarging the variational space for the @xmath94 states with the inclusion of the two - phonon configurations constructed from phonons with hexadecapole multipolarity and taking into account the three - phonon configurations .",
