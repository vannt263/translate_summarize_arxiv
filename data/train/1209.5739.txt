    "generalization has been an often - pursued goal since the early dawn of mathematics .",
    "it can be loosely defined as the process of introducing new systems in order to extend consistently the domains of existing operations while still preserving as many prior results as possible .",
    "generalization has manifested in many areas of mathematics including fundamental concepts such as numbers and geometry , systems of operations such as the arithmetic , and even domains of functions as in analytic continuation .",
    "one historical example of mathematical generalization that is of particular interest in this paper is extending the domains of special _ discrete _ functions such as finite sums and products to non - integer arguments .",
    "such process of generalization is quite different from mere interpolation , where the former is meant to preserve some fundamental properties of discrete functions as opposed to mere blind fitting .",
    "consequently , generalization has intrinsic significance that provides deep insights and leads naturally to an evolution of mathematical thought .",
    "for instance if one considers the discrete power sum function @xmath4 given in eq [ psdisctrete ] below , it is trivial to realize that an infinite number of analytic functions can correctly interpolate it .",
    "in fact , let @xmath5 be one such function , then the sum of @xmath5 with any function @xmath6 that satisfies @xmath7 for all @xmath8 will also interpolate correctly the discrete values of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the well - known bernoulli - faulhaber formula for the power sum function additionally _ preserves the recursive property _ of @xmath4 given in eq [ psrecursive ] for all real values of @xmath2 , which makes it a suitable candidate for a generalized definition of power sums .",
    "in fact , it is indeed the _",
    "unique _ family of _ polynomials _ that enjoys such advantage ; hence it is the unique most natural generalized definition of power sums if one considers polynomials to be the simplest of all possible functions .",
    "the bernoulli - faulhaber formula is given in eq [ bfformula ] , where @xmath9 are bernoulli numbers and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13    looking into the bernoulli - faulhaber formula for power sums , it is not immediately obvious , without aid of the finite difference method , why @xmath4 can be a polynomial with degree @xmath14 , even though this fact becomes literally trivial using the simple rules of summability calculus presented in this paper .",
    "of course , once a correct guess of a closed - form formula to a finite sum or product is available , it is usually straightforward to prove correctness using the method of induction .",
    "however , arriving at the right guess itself often relies on intricate ad hoc approaches .",
    "a second well - known illustrative example to the subject of mathematical generalization is extending the definition of the discrete factorial function to non - integer arguments , which had withstood many unsuccessful attempts by reputable mathematicians such as bernoulli and stirling until euler came up with his famous answer in the early 1730s in a series of letters to goldbach that introduced his infinite product formula and the gamma function @xcite . indeed , arriving at the gamma function from the discrete definition of factorial was not a simple task , needless to mention proving that it was the _",
    "unique _ natural generalization of factorials as the bohr - miller theorem nearly stated @xcite .",
    "clearly , a systematic approach is needed in answering such questions so that it can be readily applied to the potentially infinite list of special discrete functions such as the factorial - like _ hyperfactorial _ and _ superfactorial _ functions , defined in eq [ hyperf ] and eq [ superf ] respectively ( for a brief introduction to such family of functions , the reader is kindly referred to @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "summability calculus provides us with the answer .",
    "@xmath15 \\label{superf } \\textbf{superfactorial : } & \\quad \\quad s(n)=\\prod_{k=1}^n k!\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    aside from obtaining exact closed - form generalizations to discrete functions as well as performing infinitesimal calculus , which aids in computing _",
    "_ n__th - order approximation among other applications , deducing asymptotic behavior is a third fundamental problem that could have enormous applications , too .",
    "for example , euler showed that the harmonic sum was asymptotically related to the logarithmic function , which led him to introduce the famous constant @xmath16 that bears his name , which is originally defined by eq [ eulerconst ] @xcite .",
    "stirling , on the other hand , presented the famous asymptotic formula for the factorial function given in eq [ stirlingappx ] , which is used almost ubiquitously such as in the study of algorithms and data structures @xcite .",
    "additionally , glaisher in 1878 presented an asymptotic formula for the hyperfactorial function given in eq [ hyperfappx ] , which led him to introduce a new constant , denoted @xmath17 in eq [ hyperfappx ] , that is intimately related to euler s constant and the riemann zeta function @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20    while these results have been deduced at different periods of time in the history of mathematics using different approaches , a fundamental question that arises is whether there exists a simple universal calculus that bridges all of these different results together and makes their proofs almost elementary .",
    "more crucially , we desire that such calculus yield an elementary approach for obtaining asymptotic behavior to oscillating sums as well , including , obviously , the special important class of alternating sums .",
    "the answer to this question is , in fact , in the affirmative and that universal calculus is summability calculus .",
    "the primary statement of summability calculus is quite simple : given a discrete finite sum of the form @xmath21 , then such finite sum is in _",
    "analytic form_. not only can we perform differentiation and integration with respect to @xmath2 without having to rely on an explicit formula , but we can also immediately evaluate the finite sum for fractional values of @xmath2 , deduce asymptotic expressions even if the sum is oscillating , accelerate convergence of the infinite sum , assign natural values to divergent sums , and come up with a potentially infinite list of interesting identities as a result ; all without having to _ explicitly _ extend the domain of @xmath22 to non - integer values of @xmath2 .",
    "to reiterate , this follows because the expression @xmath21 embodies within its discrete definition an immediate natural definition of @xmath22 for all @xmath23 as will be shown in this paper .",
    "summability calculus vs. conventional infinitesimal calculus can be viewed in light of an interesting duality . in traditional calculus ,",
    "infinitesimal behavior at small intervals is used to understand global behavior at all intervals that lie within the same analytic disc .",
    "for instance , taylor series expansion for a function @xmath24 around a point @xmath25 is often used to compute the value of @xmath24 for some points @xmath26 outside @xmath27 , sometimes even for the entire function s domain .",
    "thus , the behavior of the analytic function at an infinitesimally small interval is sufficient to deduce global behavior of the function .",
    "such incredible property of analytic functions , a.k.a .",
    "_ rigidity _ , is perhaps the cornerstone of traditional calculus that led its wonders . in summability calculus ,",
    "on the other hand , we follow the contrary approach by employing our incomplete knowledge about the global behavior of a function to reconstruct accurately its local behavior at any desired interval .",
    "the aforementioned duality brings to mind the well - known sampling theorem . here ,",
    "if a function is _ bandlimited _ , meaning that its non - zero frequency components are restricted to a bounded region in the frequency domain , then discrete samples taken at a sufficiently high rate can be used to represent the function completely _ without loss of any information_. in such case , incomplete global information , i.e. discrete samples , can be used to reconstruct the function perfectly at all intervals , which is similar to what summability calculus fundamentally entails . does summability calculus have anything to do with the sampling theorem ?",
    "surprisingly , the answer is yes . in fact , we will use results of summability calculus to prove the sampling theorem .    aside from proving the sampling theorem using summability calculus",
    ", there is another more subtle connection between the two subjects .",
    "according to the sampling theorem , discrete samples can always be used to perfectly reconstruct the _",
    "simplest _ function that interpolates them , if _ bandwidth _ is taken as a measure of complexity . as will be shown repeatedly throughout this paper",
    ", summability calculus also operates implicitly on the simplest of all possible functions that can correctly interpolate discrete values of finite sums and additionally preserve their defining recursive prosperities .",
    "so , if the simplest interpolating function , using bandwidth as a measure of complexity , happens to satisfy the defining properties of finite sums , we would expect the resulting function to agree with what summability calculus yields .",
    "indeed , we will show that this is the case .",
    "sampling necessitates interpolation .",
    "one crucial link between interpolation and summability calculus is polynomial fitting .",
    "for example , given discrete samples of the power sum function mentioned earlier in eq [ psdisctrete ] , then such samples can be perfectly fitted using polynomials .",
    "because polynomials can be reconstructed from samples taken at any arbitrarily low sampling rate , their bandwidth must be zero regardless of whether or not polynomials are fourier transformable in the strict sense of the word .",
    "therefore , if one were to use bandwidth as a measure of complexity , polynomials are among the simplest of all possible functions , hence the bernoulli - faulhaber formula is , by this measure , the _",
    "unique most natural generalization _ to power sums .",
    "in summability calculus , polynomial fitting is a cornerstone ; it is what guarantees summability calculus to operate on the unique most natural generalization to finite sums",
    ". it may be counter - intuitive to note that polynomial fitting arises in the context of arbitrary finite sums , but this result will be established in this paper .",
    "in fact , we will show that the celebrated euler - maclaurin summation formula itself and it various analogues fundamentally arise out of polynomial fitting !",
    "we have stated that summability calculus allows us to perform infinitesimal calculus , such as differentiation and integration , and evaluate fractional finite sums without having to explicitly extend the domain of finite sums to non - integer arguments . however , if a finite sum is discrete in nature , what does its derivative mean in the first place ? to answer this question , we need to digress to a more fundamental question : what does a finite sum of the form @xmath28  fundamentally represent ? traditionally , the symbol @xmath29 was meant to be used as a shorthand notation for an iterated addition , and was naturally restricted to integers .",
    "however , it turns out that if we * define * a finite sum more broadly by * two properties * , we immediately have a natural definition that extends domain to the complex plane @xmath30 .",
    "the two properties are : + ( 1)@xmath31 + ( 2 ) @xmath32 + the two properties are two of six axioms proposed in @xcite for defining fractional finite sums . formally speaking",
    ", we say that a finite sum @xmath28   is a binary operator @xmath33 that satisfies the two properties above . of course , using these two properties , we can easily recover the original discrete definition of finite sums as follows : @xmath34    in addition , by property 2 , we derive the recurrence identity given in eq [ recur ] .",
    "such recurrence identity is extremely important in subsequent analysis .",
    "@xmath35    moreover , we immediately note that the two defining properties of finite sums suggest unique _ natural _ generalization to all @xmath36 if the infinite sum converges .",
    "this can be seen clearly from both properties 1 and 2 as shown in eq [ unqsmpconvg ] . here , because @xmath37 is well - defined for all @xmath36 , by assumption , the finite sum @xmath38 can be _ naturally _ defined for all @xmath36 , and its value is given by eq [ unqsmpconvg ] .",
    "@xmath39    this might appear trivial to observe but it is crucial to emphasize that such obvious  generalization is actually _ built on an assumption _ that does not necessarily follow from the definition of finite sums . here , it is assumed that since the infinite sum converges if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , then the sum converges to the same limit as @xmath40 in general .",
    "this is clearly only an assumption !",
    "for example , if one were to define @xmath42 by @xmath43 , then both initial condition and recurrence identity hold but the limit @xmath44 no longer exists even if @xmath45",
    ". however , it is indeed quite reasonable to use eq [ unqsmpconvg ] as a definition of fractional sums for all @xmath3 if the infinite sums converge .",
    "after all , why would we add any superficial constraints when they are not needed ?",
    "therefore , it seems obvious that a unique most natural generalization can be defined using eq [ unqsmpconvg ] if the infinite sum converges .",
    "at least , this is what we would expect if the term natural generalization ",
    "has any meaning .",
    "what is not obvious , however , is that a _ natural _ generalization of finite sums is _ uniquely _ defined for all @xmath2 and all @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , even a finite sum of the , somewhat complex , form @xmath21  has a unique natural generalization that extends its domain to the complex plane @xmath30 .",
    "however , the argument in the latter case is more intricate as will be shown later .    in addition",
    ", we will also show that the study of divergent series and _ analytic summability theory _ is intimately tied to summability calculus . here",
    ", we will assume a generalized definition of infinite sums @xmath47 and describe an algebra valid under such generalized definition .",
    "using @xmath47 , we will show how the study of oscillating sums is greatly simplified .",
    "for example , if a divergent series @xmath48 is defined by a value @xmath49 under @xmath47 , then , as far as summability calculus is concerned , the series behaves _ exactly as if it were a convergent sum _ !",
    "here , the term summable  divergent series , loosely speaking , means that a natural value can be assigned to the divergent series following some reasonable arguments .",
    "for example , one special case of @xmath47 is * abel summability method * , which assigns to a divergent series @xmath48 the value @xmath50 if the limit exists . intuitively speaking",
    ", this method appeals to continuity as a rational basis for defining divergent sums , which is similar to the arguments that @xmath51 and @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "abel summability method was used prior to abel ; in fact , euler used it quite extensively and called it the generating function method  @xcite .",
    "in addition , poisson also used it frequently in summing fourier series @xcite .    using the generalized definition of sums given by @xmath47",
    ", we will show that summability theory generalizes the earlier statement that a finite sum is naturally defined by eq [ unqsmpconvg ] , which otherwise would only be valid if the infinite sums converge . using @xmath47 , on the other hand",
    ", we will show that the latter equation holds , in general , if the infinite sums exist in @xmath47 , i.e. even if they are not necessarily convergent in the strict sense of the word .",
    "however , not all divergent sums are defined in @xmath47 so a more general statement will be presented .    with this in mind , we are now ready to see what the derivative of a finite sum actually means . in brief , since we are claiming that any finite sum implies a _",
    "unique _ natural generalization that extends its domain from a discrete set of numbers to the complex plane @xmath30 , the derivative of a finite sum is simply the derivative of its unique natural generalization .",
    "the key advantage of summability calculus is that we can find such derivative of a finite sum without having to find an analytic expression to its unique natural generalization .",
    "in fact , we can integrate as well .",
    "so , notations such as @xmath54 and even @xmath55 will become meaningful .    in summary",
    ", this paper presents the foundations of summability calculus , which bridges the gap between various well - established results in number theory , summability theory , infinitesimal calculus , and the calculus of finite differences .",
    "in fact , and as will be shown throughout this paper , it contributes to more branches of mathematics such as approximation theory , asymptotic analysis , information theory , and the study of accelerating series convergence .",
    "however , before we begin discussing summability calculus , we first have to outline some terminologies that will be used throughout this paper .      [ simplfin ] = @xmath56 = @xmath57 = ( simple ) + @xmath58 @xmath59 ( convoluted )    _ simple _ finite sums and products",
    "are defined in this paper to be any finite sum or product given by the general form shown above , where @xmath60 is an iteration variable that is independent of the bound @xmath2 . in a convoluted sum or product",
    ", on the other hand , the iterated function @xmath46 depends on _ both _ the iteration variable @xmath60 and the bound @xmath2 as well .",
    "clearly , simple sums and products are special cases of convoluted sums and products .",
    "because the manuscript is quite lengthy , we will strive to make it as readable as possible .",
    "for instance , we will typically use @xmath22 to denote a discrete function and let @xmath61 denote its unique natural generalization in almost every example . here , the notation @xmath62 is meant to imply that both domain and range are simply connected regions , i.e. _ subsets _ , of the complex plane . in other words",
    ", we will not explicitly state the domain of every single function since it can often be inferred without notable efforts from the function s definition .",
    "statements such as let @xmath63  and @xmath64  will be avoided unless deemed necessary .",
    "similarly , a statement such as @xmath65 converges to @xmath66  will be used to imply that @xmath65 approaches @xmath66 whenever @xmath66 is defined and that both share the same domain .",
    "thus , we will avoid statements such as @xmath65 converges to @xmath66 in @xmath67 and has a simple pole at @xmath68 ",
    ", when both @xmath65 and @xmath66 have the same pole .",
    "whereas summability calculus extends the domain of a finite sum @xmath69 from a subset of integers to the complex plane @xmath3 , we will usually focus on examples for which @xmath2 is real - valued .",
    "in addition , the following important definition will be used quite frequently .",
    "+    ' '' ''    [ asymptorder ] a function @xmath70 is said to be _ asymptotically of a finite differentiation order _ if a non - negative integer @xmath71 exists such that @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "the minimum non - negative integer @xmath71 that satisfies such condition for a function @xmath66 will be called its _ asymptotic differentiation order_.    ' '' ''    in other words , if a function @xmath70 has an asymptotic differentiation order @xmath71 , then _ only the function up to its _ _ m__th derivative matter asymptotically_. for example , any polynomial with degree @xmath2 has the asymptotic differentiation order @xmath74 .",
    "a second example is the function @xmath75 , which has an asymptotic differentiation order of zero because its 1^st^ derivative vanishes asymptotically .",
    "non - polynomially bounded functions such as @xmath76 and the factorial function @xmath77 have an infinite asymptotic differentiation order .    finally ,",
    "in addition to the hyperfactorial and superfactorial functions described earlier , the following functions will be used frequently throughout this paper :    = * generalized harmonic numbers : * = @xmath78 + * gamma function : * @xmath79 + * gauss pi function : * @xmath80 + * log - factorial function : * @xmath81 + * digamma function : * @xmath82 + * riemann zeta function : * @xmath83 , for @xmath84 +    here , it is worth mentioning that the superfactorial function @xmath85 is also often defined using the _",
    "double gamma function _ or _",
    "barnes g - function _",
    "all of these definitions are essentially equivalent except for minor differences . in this paper , we will exclusively use the superfactorial function as defined earlier in eq [ superf ] .",
    "moreover , we will almost always use the log - factorial function @xmath86 , as opposed to the log - gamma function .",
    "legendre s normalization @xmath87 is unwieldy , and will be avoided to simplify mathematics .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to note that avoiding such normalization of the gamma function is not a new practice .",
    "in fact , legendre s normalization has been avoided and even harshly criticized by some 20^th^ century mathematicians such as lanczos , who described it as void of any rationality  @xcite .",
    "it is probably reasonable to argue that the subject of finite sums stretches back in time to the very early dawn of mathematics . in 499 a.d . , the great indian mathematician aryabhata investigated the sum of arithmetic progressions and presented its closed - form formula in his famous book _ aryabhatiya _ when he was 23 years old . in this book",
    ", he also stated formulas for sums of powers of integers up to the summation of cubes .",
    "unfortunately , mathematical notations were immature during that era and the great mathematician had to state his mathematical equations using plain words : _ diminish the given number of terms by one then divide by two then _   @xcite .",
    "in addition , the greeks were similarly interested as euclid demonstrated in his elements book ix proposition 35 , in which he presents the well - known formula for the sum of a finite geometric series . between",
    "then and now , countless mathematicians were fascinated with the subject of finite sums .",
    "given the great interest mathematicians have placed in summations and knowing that this paper is all about finite sums , it should not be surprising to see that a large number of the results presented herein have already been discovered at different points in time during the past 2,500 years .",
    "in fact , some of what can be rightfully considered as the building blocks of summability calculus were deduced 300 years ago , while others were published as recently as 2010 .",
    "the earliest work that is directly related to summability calculus is gregory s quadrature formula , whose original intention was in numerical integration @xcite .",
    "we will show that gregory s formula indeed corresponds to the unique most natural generalization of simple finite sums .",
    "later around the year 1735 , euler and maclaurin independently came up with the celebrated euler - macluarin summation formula that also extends the domain of simple finite sums to non - integer arguments @xcite .",
    "the euler - maclaurin formula has been widely applied , and was described as one of the most remarkable formulas of mathematics  @xcite . here",
    ", it is worth mentioning that neither euler nor maclaurin published a formula for the remainder term , which was first developed by poisson in 1823 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the euler - macluarin summation formula and gregory s is that finite differences are used in the latter formula as opposed to infinitesimal derivatives .",
    "nevertheless , they are both formally equivalent , and one can be derived from the other @xcite . in 1870 , george boole introduced his summation formula , which is the analog of the euler - maclaurin summation formula for alternating sums @xcite .",
    "boole summation formula agrees , at least formally , with the euler - macluarin summation formula , and there is evidence that suggests it was known to euler as well @xcite .    in this manuscript , we will derive these formulas , generalize them to convoluted sums , prove their uniqueness for being the most natural generalization to finite sums , generalize them to oscillating sums , and present their counterparts using finite differences as opposed to infinitesimal derivatives .",
    "we will show that the euler - maclaurin summation formula arises out of polynomial fitting , and show that boole summation formula is intimately tied with the subject of divergent series .",
    "most importantly , we will show that it is more convenient to use them _ in conjunction _ with the foundational rules of summability calculus .",
    "the second building block of summability calculus is asymptotic analysis .",
    "ever since stirling and euler presented their famous asymptotic expressions to the factorial and harmonic number respectively , a deep interest in the asymptotic behavior of special functions such as finite sums was forever instilled in the hearts of mathematicians .",
    "this includes glaisher s work on the hyperfactorial function and barnes work on the superfactorial function , to name a few . here",
    ", gregory quadrature formula , euler - maclaurin summation formula , and boole summation formula proved indispensable . for example , a very nice application of such asymptotic analysis in explaining a curious observation of approximation errors is illustrated in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the euler - like family of summation formulas to the case of oscillating sums , which makes the task of deducing asymptotic expressions to such finite sums nearly elementary .",
    "we will also prove equivalence of all asymptotic formulas .",
    "the third building block of summability calculus is summability theory .",
    "perhaps , the most famous summability theorist was again euler who did not hesitate to use divergent series . according to euler",
    ", the sum of an infinite series should carry a more general definition .",
    "in particular , if a sequence of algebraic operations eventually arrive at a divergent series , the value of the divergent series should assume the value of the algebraic expression from which it was derived @xcite . however , euler s approach was ad - hoc based , and the first systematic and coherent theory of divergent sums was initiated by cesaro who introduced what is now referred to as the cesaro mean @xcite .",
    "cesaro summability method , although weak , enjoys the advantage of being stable , regular , and linear , which will prove to be crucial for mathematical consistency . in the 20th century , the most well renowned summability theorist was hardy whose classic book _ divergent series",
    "_ remains authoritative .",
    "earlier , we stated that summable divergent series behave as if they were convergent  .",
    "so , in principle , we would expect a finite sum to satisfy eq [ unqsmpconvg ] if infinite sums are summable .",
    "ramanujan realized that summability of divergent series might be linked to infinitesimal calculus using such equation @xcite .",
    "however , his statements were often imprecisely stated and his conclusions were occasionally incorrect for reasons that will become clear in this paper . in this paper , we state results precisely and prove correctness .",
    "we will present the generalized definition of infinite sums @xmath47 in chapter [ chapter4 ] , which allows us to integrate the subject of summability theory with the study of finite sums into a single coherent framework . as will be shown repeatedly throughout this paper ,",
    "this generalized definition of sums is indeed one of the cornerstones of summability calculus .",
    "it will also shed important insights into the subject of divergent series .",
    "for example , we will present a method of deducing analytic expressions and accelerating convergence  of divergent series .",
    "in addition , we will also introduce a new summability method @xmath88 , which is weaker than @xmath47 but it is strong enough to correctly  sum almost all examples of divergent sums that will referred to in this manuscript .",
    "so , whereas @xmath47 is a formal construct that is decoupled from any particular method of computation , results will be deduced using @xmath47 and verified numerically using @xmath88 .",
    "the fourth building block of summability calculus is polynomial approximation .",
    "unfortunately , little work has been made to define fractional finite sums using polynomial approximations except notably for the fairly recent work of mller and schleicher @xcite . in their work",
    ", a fractional finite sum is defined by using its asymptotic behavior . in a nutshell ,",
    "if a finite sum can be approximated _ in a bounded region _ by a polynomial and if the error of such approximation vanishes as this bounded region is pushed towards @xmath89 , we might then evaluate a fractional sum by evaluating it asymptotically and propagating values backwards using the recursive property in eq [ recur ] . in 2011 ,",
    "moreover , mller and schleicher provided an _ axiomatic _",
    "treatment to the subject of finite sums by proposing six axioms that uniquely extend the definition of finite sums to non - integer arguments , two of which are the defining properties of finite sums listed earlier @xcite .",
    "in addition to those two properties , they included linearity , holomorphicity of finite sums of polynomials , and translation invariance ( the reader is kindly referred to @xcite for details ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , they also included the method of polynomial approximation as a sixth axiom ; meaning that if a simple finite sum @xmath90 can be approximated by a polynomial asymptotically , then such approximation is assumed to be valid for _ fractional _ values of @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we do not pursue an axiomatic foundation of finite sums , although the treatment of mller and schleicher is a special case of a more general definition that is presented in this paper because their work is restricted to simple finite sums @xmath90 , in which @xmath91 is asymptotically of a finite differentiation order ( see definition [ asymptorder ] ) . in this paper , on the other hand , we will present a general statement that is applicable to all finite sums , including those that can not be approximated by polynomials , and extend it further to oscillating sums and convoluted sums as well . finally , we will use such results to establish that the euler - like family of summation formulas arise out of polynomial fitting .",
    "the fifth building block of summability calculus is the calculus of finite differences , which was first systematically developed by jacob stirling in 1730 @xcite , although some of its most basic results can be traced back to the works of newton such as newton s interpolation formula . in this paper",
    ", we will derive the basic results of the calculus of finite differences from summability calculus and show that they are closely related .",
    "for example , we will show that the summability method @xmath88 introduced in chapter [ chapter4 ] is intimately tied to newton s interpolation formula and present a geometric proof to the sampling theorem using the generalized definition @xmath47 and the calculus of finite differences .",
    "in fact , we will prove a stronger statement , which we will call the _ half sampling theorem_. the sampling theorem was popularized in the 20th century by claude shannon in his seminal paper communications in the presence of noise ",
    "@xcite , but its origin date much earlier . a brief excellent introduction to the sampling theorem and its origins",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "finally , summability calculus naturally yields a rich set of identities related to fundamental constants such as @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , and special functions such as the riemann zeta function and the gamma function .",
    "some of those identities shown in this paper appear to be new while others were proved at different periods of time throughout the past three centuries .",
    "it is intriguing to note that while many of such identities were proved at different periods of time by different mathematicians using different approaches , summability calculus yields a simple set of tools for deducing them immediately .",
    "the rest of this manuscript is structured as follows .",
    "we will first introduce the foundational rules of performing infinitesimal calculus , such as differentiation , integration , and computing series expansion , on simple finite sums and products , and extend the calculus next to address convoluted sums and products .",
    "after that , we introduce the generalized definition of infinite sums @xmath47 and show how central it is to summability calculus . using @xmath47",
    ", we derive foundational theorems for oscillating finite sums that simplify their study considerably , and yield important insights to the study of divergent series and series convergence acceleration .",
    "next , we present a simple method for directly _ evaluating _ finite sums @xmath21  for all @xmath36 . throughout these sections , we will repeatedly prove that we are always dealing with the exact same generalized definition of finite sums , meaning that all results are consistent with each other and can be used interchangeably .",

    "we will begin our treatment of summability calculus on simple finite sums and products . even though results of this section are merely special cases of the more general results presented later in which we address the more general case of convoluted sums and products , it is still important to start with these basic results since they are encountered more often , and can serve as a good introduction to what summability calculus can markedly accomplish .",
    "in addition , the results presented herein for simple finite sums and products are themselves used in establishing the more general case for convoluted sums and products in the following chapter .",

    "luckily , however , a rigorous proof of eq [ eq212 ] can be made using the two defining properties of finite sums as follows : @xmath99    upon combining the recurrence identities in eq [ eq211 ] and eq [ eq212 ] , eq [ eq213 ] follows immediately , where @xmath100 is an arbitrary periodic function with unit period . since @xmath101 is constant with respect to @xmath2",

    "note that setting @xmath104 is also consistent with the use of _ bandwidth _ as a measure of complexity as discussed earlier in the chapter [ chaptintro ] . in simple terms",

    "this can be proved from the defining properties of finite sums as follows : @xmath108    thus , we always have @xmath109 for any function @xmath46 .",
    "this last summation is commonly thought of as a special case of the _ empty sum _ and is usually defined to be zero by convention .",
    "however , we note here that the empty sum is zero by _ necessity _ , i.e. not a mere convention .",
    "in addition , while it is true that @xmath109 , it does not necessarily follow that @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",

    "in fact , using property 1 of finite sums and the empty sum rule , we always have : @xmath114    the empty sum rule and eq [ sumtonegative ] were proposed earlier in @xcite , in which polynomial approximation is used to define a restricted class of simple finite sums as will be discussed later in chapter [ chapter6 ] .",
    "finally , the integral rule follows immediately from the differentiation rule given earlier in eq [ eq214 ] , and is given by eq [ eq216 ] .",
    "in fact , if we denote @xmath115 , then @xmath116 . thus , the integration rule in eq [ eq216 ] yields a single arbitrary constant only as expected , which is @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118    using the above rules for simple finite sums , we can quickly deduce similar rules for simple finite products by rewriting finite products as @xmath119 and using the chain rule , which yields the differentiation rule given in eq [ eq217 ] .",

    "in fact , we will now establish that the conditions in eq [ eq219 ] are required in order for the function @xmath22 to be smooth , i.e. infinitely differentiable .",
    "first , suppose that we have a simple finite sum @xmath131 .",

    "first , it becomes clear that in order for the function to satisfy the recurrence identity and initial condition in eq [ eq211 ] and at the same time be infinitely differentiable , it must satisfy eq [ eq219 ] .",
    "second , its _",

    "while infinitely many functions exist that can correctly satisfy both initial condition and recurrence identity , there is _ one and only one _ function that can arise out of the successive polynomial approximations method given in the theorem .",
    "why is this significant ?",
    "this is because , in a loose sense , that unique function is the simplest possible generalization ; as you incorporate additional information about the original finite sum , you gain additional information about its unique natural generalization .",
    "of course , the argument of being a natural  generalization is intricate .",
    "one has to agree on what natural  means in the first place . however , as shown in theorem [ statofuniq ] , a reasonable statement of natural generalization can be made .",
    "in addition , we stated earlier in eq [ eq213 ] that periodic functions @xmath100 will not be artificially added because the original finite sum carries no information about such functions",
    ". we will show later that such choice of @xmath104 is exactly what the statement of theorem [ statofuniq ] entails .",
    "furthermore , we will show additional properties of unique natural generalization .",
    "for instance , if @xmath28  tends to a limit @xmath164 as @xmath165 then its unique natural generalization also tends to same limit @xmath49 . in the latter case ,",
    "unique natural generalization is given by the natural  expression in eq [ unqsmpconvg ] that was discussed earlier .",
    "moreover , we will show that if the finite sum @xmath28  asymptotically behaves as a polynomial , then its unique natural generalization also converges to the same polynomial asymptotically , and others .    in the sequel",
    ", we will derive a complete set of rules for performing infinitesimal calculus on simple finite sums and products without having to know what the generalized definition @xmath96 actually is .",
    "we will also show that the foundational rules given in table [ tablerules ] indeed correspond to the unique most natural generalization to simple finite sums and products .",
    "however , before this is done , we present a few elementary illustrative examples first .      for our first example",
    ", we return to the power sum function presented earlier in eq [ psdisctrete ] .",
    "the first point we note about this function is that its @xmath166^th^ derivative is * zero * , which follows immediately from rule 1 in table [ tablerules ] .",
    "thus , the unique most natural generalized definition of the power sum function has to be a polynomial of degree @xmath167 . because there exists sufficiently many sample points to the discrete power sum function , infinite to be more specific , that polynomial has to be unique .",
    "of course , those polynomials are given by the bernoulli - faulhaber formula .",
    "second , assume that @xmath168 and let @xmath169 then we have by rule 2 : @xmath170    using the empty sum rule , i.e. rule 3 in table [ tablerules ] , and after setting @xmath171 , we have @xmath172 .",
    "now , if we let @xmath158 denotes the polynomial @xmath173 , we have by eq [ eq221 ] the following simple recursive rule for deducing closed - form expressions of power sums : @xmath174    third , because we always have @xmath175 , rule 3 can be used in either case to deduce that @xmath176 .",
    "that is , @xmath177 is always a proper factor of power sum polynomials .",
    "the fact that @xmath177 is always a proper factor was observed as early as faulhaber himself in his book _ academia algebrae _ in 1631 @xcite .",
    "the recursive solution of power sums given in eq [ cookbook ] is well known and was used by bernoulli himself @xcite . due to its apparent simplicity",
    ", it has been called the cook - book recipe  by some mathematicians @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , its simple two - line proof herein illustrates efficacy of summability calculus in deducing closed - form expressions of finite sums .",
    "our second example is the function @xmath22 given in eq [ eq223 ] . before we deduce a closed - form expression @xmath96 of this function using summability calculus , we know in advance that @xmath178 because we could equivalently take the lower bound of @xmath60 inside the summation to be zero without changing the function itself , which is similar to the power sum function discussed earlier . in other words , since @xmath179 and @xmath180 share the same boundary condition and recurrence identity , they correspond to the exact same function . consequently , the empty sum rule can be applied in either case . @xmath181    using rule 1 , we have : @xmath182    eq [ eq224 ] is a first - order linear differential equation whose solution is available in closed - form @xcite . using initial condition @xmath183 , and after rearranging the terms , we obtain the closed - form expression given eq [ eq225 ] .",
    "note that @xmath178 holds as expected .",
    "our third example is the power function @xmath185 . because @xmath186 is independent of @xmath60 , we have @xmath187 .",
    "using rule 4 , we deduce that @xmath188 , for some constant @xmath189 , which is indeed an elementary result in calculus .",
    "fourth , if we let @xmath22 be the discrete factorial function and denote its generalization using the pi symbol @xmath190 , as gauss did , then , by rule 4 , we have @xmath191 , which is a well - known result where the quantity @xmath192 is @xmath193 and @xmath194 is the digamma function . here , in the last example ,",
    "@xmath189 is euler s constant .    for a fifth example , let us consider the function @xmath195 . if we denote @xmath196 and @xmath197 and by successive differentiation using rule 1 , we note that the generalized function @xmath96 can be formally expressed using the series expansion in eq [ eq226 ] .",
    "thus , @xmath198 , where the constants @xmath199 and @xmath200 can be found using any two values of @xmath22 .",
    "this can be verified readily to be correct .",
    "@xmath201    the previous five examples illustrate why the constant @xmath189 in the derivative rules , i.e. rule 1 and rule 4 , is not an arbitrary constant .",
    "however , if it is not arbitrary , is there a systematic way of deducing its value ? we have previously answered this question in the affirmative and we will present a formula for @xmath189 later .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to continue with one additional example that illustrates , what is perhaps , the most straightforward special case in which we could deduce the value of @xmath189 immediately without having to resort to its , somewhat , involved expression .",
    "this example also illustrates the concept of natural generalization of discrete functions and why a finite sum embodies within its discrete definition a natural analytic continuation to all @xmath3 .",
    "our final example in this section is the function @xmath202 , which is also known as the harmonic number .",
    "its derivative is given by rule 1 and it is shown in eq [ eq227 ] .",
    "@xmath203    now , because @xmath204 as @xmath205 , we expect its natural generalization @xmath96 to exhibit the same behavior as well ( as will be shown later , this statement is , in fact , always correct ) .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath206 as @xmath205 . plugging this condition into eq [ eq227 ] yields the unique value @xmath207 .",
    "of course , this is indeed the case if we generalize the definition of harmonic numbers using the digamma function @xmath194 and euler s constant @xmath92 as shown in eq [ eq228 ] ( for a brief introduction into the digamma and polygamma functions , see @xcite ) .",
    "again , using eq [ eq228 ] , @xmath208 as expected but @xmath209 . in this example , therefore , we used both the recursive property of the discrete function as well as one of its visible natural consequences to determine how its derivative should behave at the limit @xmath205 .",
    "so , in principle , we had a _",
    "macro _ look at the asymptotic behavior of the discrete function to deduce its _ local _ derivative at @xmath171 , which is the interesting duality we discussed earlier in chapter [ chaptintro ] .",
    "validity of this approach will be proved rigorously in the sequel .",
    "@xmath210      in this section , we present fundamental results in summability calculus for an important special class of discrete functions that will be referred to as _ semi - linear _ simple finite sums and their associated products .",

    "therefore , we expect @xmath88 to correctly sum taylor series expansions that are not too rapidly diverging .",

    "nevertheless , it converges eventually to the value of the original function , where the relative approximation error in this particular example is less than 0.2% , which is accurate to a remarkable degree given the fact that we used a polynomial of degree 100 for a point @xmath816 that lies outside the radius of convergence of the corresponding taylor s series .     plotted against @xmath60 for @xmath815 and @xmath820    because a complex - valued function @xmath24 satisfies the cauchy - riemann equations , which essentially state that higher derivatives @xmath821 are the same regardless of the direction of the step size @xmath725 over the complex plane @xmath30 , claim [ claim411 ] and claim [ claim412 ] also hold for complex - valued functions .",
    "for example , if @xmath822 , and if we use its well - known series expansion around @xmath814 , then the approximation @xmath721 converges to @xmath24 as @xmath40 in a larger disc than the radius of convergence of the classical taylor series .",
    "for example , if @xmath823 , where @xmath824 , we have @xmath825 and @xmath826 . by contrast , we know that the exact value is given by @xmath827 . clearly , @xmath721 indeed approaches @xmath24 as @xmath40 even though @xmath828 falls outside the radius of convergence of the classical taylor series .",
    "moreover , we can immediately deduce using theorem [ theorem231 ] that the following series expansion holds for the derivative of the log - factorial function @xmath373 : @xmath829 plugging @xmath140 into both sides of the last equation yields : @xmath830 however , the left - hand sum diverges .",
    "using @xmath88 , on the other hand , the left - hand sum is summable and its sum indeed converges to 1 .",

    "before we conclude this section , it is worth pointing out that theorem [ theorem621 ] indicates that the euler - maclaurin summation formula is indeed closely related to taylor s theorem .",
    "in fact , the expression in eq [ theorem621eq1 ] resembles taylor series expansions , and we do obtain a taylor series by simply subtracting @xmath1193 from @xmath22 . it should not be surprising , therefore , to note that analytic summability methods that are consistent with the @xmath47 definition of infinite sums can work reasonably well even with the euler - maclaurin summation formula .",
    "we have already illustrated this in table [ tab43bern ] , in which we showed that the sum @xmath1194 is _ nearly _ summable using @xmath88 . in particular , using @xmath88 with small @xmath2 yields reasonably accurate figures , and accuracy improves as we increase @xmath2 until we reach about @xmath1195 , after which the error begins to increase .",
    "this is also true for the sum @xmath558 , which is formally equivalent to euler s constant @xmath92 as discussed earlier .",
    "such close correspondence between the euler - maclaurin summation formula and taylor series expansion also shows that the euler - maclaurin formula is an asymptotic expansion . here , if @xmath91 is asymptotically of a finite differentiation order @xmath71 , then by taylor s theorem : @xmath1196    eq [ emisasym ] is easily established upon using , for example , the lagrange remainder form .",
    "now , looking into eq [ theorem621eq2 ] , we see that the expression indeed satisfies initial condition and recurrence identity by referring to the earlier equation [ emisasym ] . consequently , if @xmath91 is asymptotically of a finite differentiation order @xmath71 , we have by differentiating both sides of eq [ theorem621eq2 ] the following result : @xmath1197    last equation was the basis of many identities derived in section [ sectionsfsgc ] .",
    "this is a simple informal justification as to why the euler - maclaurin summation formula is more correctly interpreted as an asymptotic series expansion .",
    "finally , in section [ section_23 ] , we proved that summability calculus yields unique most natural generalization for semi - linear simple finite sums by reducing argument for unique natural generalization to the case of linear fitting since all semi - linear simple finite sums are asymptotically linear in bounded regions . here",
    ", we can see that for the general case of simple finite sums , summability calculus yields unique natural generalization as well because it implicitly uses polynomial fitting . because polynomial fitting is the simplest generalization",
    "if it can correctly interpolate discrete points , and given lack of additional special requirements , it is indeed the unique most natural generalization .",
    "so , where does polynomial fitting show up in summability calculus ?    to answer the question , we return to theorem [ theorem621 ] . in the proof of eq [ theorem621eq1 ] , we note that the crucial property of the functions @xmath1198 that make @xmath96 satisfy initial conditions and recurrence identity is the condition @xmath1199 .",
    "however , it is obvious that an infinite number of functions @xmath1198 exist that can satisfy such condition . nevertheless , because the only condition required happens to be satisfied by the bernoulli - faulhaber formula , which is the unique _ polynomial solution _ to the required condition , defining @xmath1200 for fractional @xmath26 by the bernoulli - faulhaber formula is equivalent to polynomial fitting .",
    "such choice of generalization coincides with the euler - maclaurin summation formula as proved in theorem [ theorem621 ] .",
    "consequently , the argument for unique natural generalization in summability calculus , in the general case , is reduced to the argument of polynomial fitting .      in chapter [ chapter2 ]",
    ", we showed that a simple finite sum is formally given by the euler - maclaurin summation formula .",
    "in addition , we showed that simple finite sums of the form @xmath90 in which @xmath91 is asymptotically of a finite differentiation order are easier to work with .",
    "for instance , instead of evaluating the entire euler - maclaurin summation formula , we can exploit the fact that @xmath91 is asymptotically of a finite differentiation order and use eq [ corollary251_3eq ] instead if we wish to compute the derivative .",
    "similarly , such advantage shows up again in section [ section6dot2 ] as stated in eq [ theorem621eq2 ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath46 is oscillating , i.e. of the form @xmath1201 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary non - constant periodic sign sequence , then @xmath46 is not asymptotically of a finite differentiation order .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath1202 is , then we can use the euler - like summation formula for alternating sums to exploit such advantage as well .",
    "in fact , this was the main motivation behind introducing such euler - like family of summations , which allowed us to easily perform infinitesimal calculus and deduce asymptotic behavior as was done repeatedly throughout chapter [ chapter5 ] .",
    "the objective of this section is to present the analog of theorem [ theorem621 ] for oscillating simple finite sums .",
    "similar to earlier results , this will provide us with a much simpler method of handling such sums .",
    "because each function @xmath1203 , where @xmath1 is periodic with period @xmath1033 , can be decomposed into a sum of a finite number of functions of the form @xmath1204 , as shown in corollary [ corollary522 ] , we will focus on the latter class of functions . again , the first component given by @xmath1205 is evaluated using theorem [ theorem621 ] but all other components in which @xmath1206 are evaluated using the following theorem .",

    "if we apply both properties to the logarithmic function @xmath1352 , we have : @xmath1359 however , because eq [ logbwiszero_1 ] must hold for all @xmath189 , we must have @xmath1360 .",
    "we can verify this by using eq [ sec711higherderiv_4 ] .",
    "here , we note that regardless of the length of the sampling interval @xmath604 , eq [ sec711higherderiv_4 ] seems to hold for the logarithmic function for all @xmath1361 . for instance",
    ", choosing @xmath1305 and @xmath143 yields the identity in eq [ logbwiszero_2 ] ; a result that was also proved in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the identity is both proved and generalized to @xmath1362 for @xmath1363 using probability theory .",
    "we will present similar other identities at a later section .",
    "@xmath1364      in this section , we present the discrete analog of the many euler - like summation formulas deduced in earlier chapters .",
    "our starting point is eq [ diffvaluesofz_4 ] , which extends the classical riemann sum and presents higher degree approximations to integrals .",
    "choosing @xmath1305 yields gregory s quadrature formula given by eq [ sect72_gregory ] . here , the constants @xmath1365 are called gregory coefficients ( oeis a002206 ( numerators ) and a002207 ( denominators)@xcite ) .",
    "clearly , gregory s formula is analogous to the euler - maclaurin summation formula where finite differences replace infinitesimal derivatives . to deduce the analog of remaining euler - like summation formulas",
    ", we note again that the discrete analog of taylor s series expansion is given by newton s interpolation formula : @xmath1368 here , @xmath1369 and @xmath1370 is the _ falling factorial _ defined by @xmath1371 .",
    "one way of interpreting this equation is to note that it yields consistent results when the forward difference operator @xmath1259 is applied to both sides of the equation , which , in turn , follows because @xmath1372 .",
    "using analytic summability theory , and in a manner that is analogous to the development of chapter [ chapter5 ] , we have : @xmath1373 here , we note that @xmath1374 is the @xmath47 value of an infinite sum that also involves the falling factorial function @xmath1375 .",
    "because @xmath1375 is a polynomial of degree @xmath1361 , the constants @xmath1374 can be computed from the constants @xmath1376 .",
    "in particular , using stirling numbers of the first kind @xmath1377 , we have : @xmath1378 eq [ sect72_divergsum_1 ] , in turn , implies that : @xmath1379 in addition , we have that the @xmath47 value of divergent sums is formally given by : @xmath1380 equally important , last equation is also a method of deducing asymptotic expressions to the oscillating sums @xmath1381 . finally , to evaluate simple finite sums directly , in a manner that is analogous to the development of chapter [ chapter6 ]",
    ", we can use the following equation , which holds formally for all @xmath68 : @xmath1382 here , @xmath1383 .",
    "the proof of eq [ sect72_divergsum_4 ] is analogous to the proof of theorem [ theorem621 ] . if @xmath1384 as @xmath1166 , eq [ sect72_divergsum_4 ] can be used as an asymptotic expression and the infinite sum needs not be entirely evaluated .",
    "similarly , we have the following evaluation method for oscillating finite sums : @xmath1385 here , @xmath1386 , which is available in analytic closed form . in particular , if @xmath1387 is defined as in theorem [ theorem631 ] , then we have : @xmath1388 validity of the new formulas above is illustrated in the following section .",
    "the rules derived in the previous section can be applied to arbitrary discrete functions . in the context of summability calculus , these rules present alternative formal methods of computing fractional sums using their unique most natural generalizations .",
    "for example , we can safely replace the euler - maclaurin summation formula with gregory s formula to find boundary values of higher order derivatives so that the non - arbitrary constant in the differentiation rule of simple finite sums can be determined .",
    "in addition , we can use the methods given in eq [ sect72_divergsum_4 ] and eq [ sect72_evaloscillatingsum_1 ] to compute fractional sums directly instead of using the theorems of chapter [ chapter6 ] .",
    "however , we need to exercise caution when using any discretization of continuous functions to avoid under - sampling ! once discrete samples carry complete information of the original continuous functions , then the calculus of finite differences can indeed become a useful tool for analyzing simple finite sums and products . in this section",
    ", we will present a few examples that illustrate the latter point .      in eq [ logbwiszero_2 ] , we derived an infinite product formula for the natural logarithmic base @xmath94 by applying eq [ sec711higherderiv_1 ] to the logarithmic function . of course , the logarithmic function is merely one possibility .",
    "for example , if we apply eq [ sec711higherderiv_1 ] to the simple finite sum @xmath1389 , we obtain eq [ ex731_1 ] .",
    "eq [ ex731_1 ] was first proved by ser in 1926 and was later rediscovered by sondow in 2003 using hypergeometric series @xcite .",
    "@xmath1390    moreover , we can use the same approach to derive additional interesting identities .",
    "for example , if we apply eq [ sec711higherderiv_1 ] to the log - superfactorial function , @xmath1391 , we obtain : @xmath1392 again , the internal exponents are given by the binomial coefficients alternating in sign . dividing eq [ ex731_1 ] by eq [ ex731_2 ] yields eq [ ex731_3 ] .",
    "this equation was derived in @xcite using double integrals via analytic continuation of lerch s transcendent .",
    "@xmath1393    finally , suppose we have @xmath1394 , and we wish to find its derivative at @xmath171 .",
    "using summability calculus , we immediately have by theorem [ theorem231 ] that the following equation holds : @xmath1395 using eq [ sec711higherderiv_1 ] , on the other hand , yields the infinite product formula : @xmath1396\\ ] ] equating both equations yields eq [ ex731_6 ] .",
    "an alternative proof to such identity is given in @xcite .",
    "@xmath1397      suppose we start with the harmonic numbers @xmath1398 and we wish to find its derivative at @xmath171 .",
    "we know by summability calculus that the derivative is given by @xmath346 .",
    "since we have for the harmonic numbers @xmath1399 , applying eq [ sec711higherderiv_1 ] also yields the original series representation for @xmath346 .",
    "however , such approach can also be applied to the generalized harmonic numbers @xmath1400 , which would yield different series representations for the riemann zeta function @xmath1401 as given by eq [ ex732_1 ] .",
    "eq [ ex732_1 ] follows immediately by summability calculus and eq [ sec711higherderiv_1 ] .",
    "interestingly , such identity is a globally convergent expression to the riemann zeta function for all @xmath1402 .",
    "it was discovered by helmut hasse in 1930 @xcite .",
    "@xmath1403 note that both eq [ ex732_1 ] and infinite product representation for @xmath1404 in eq [ ex731_1 ] can both be used to establish the following well - known result : @xmath1405      gregory s formula presents a method of numerical computation of integrals that is similar to the euler - maclaurin summation formula .",
    "in this example , we will use gregory s formula to derive identites that relate gregory coefficients with many fundamental constants .",
    "our starting point would be the case of _ semi - linear _ simple finite sums @xmath90 that have well - known asymptotic expansions @xmath1406 such that @xmath1407 . to recall earlier discussion ,",
    "if a simple finite sum is semi - linear , then @xmath1408 as @xmath40 , which implies that @xmath1409 as @xmath40 .",
    "now , by gregory s formula : @xmath1410    for example , if @xmath1411 , and @xmath168 , then @xmath1412 . plugging this into the above formula yields : @xmath1413 eq [ ex733_2 ] is one of the earliest expressions discovered that express euler s constant @xmath92 as a limit of rational terms .",
    "it was discovered by kluyver in 1924 using the integral representation of the digamma function @xmath1414@xcite .",
    "similarly , if we now let @xmath1415 and choose @xmath1416 , then we have : @xmath1417 because @xmath1418 , we have : @xmath1419    of course , such approach can be applied to many other functions . in addition",
    ", we have by gregory s formula : @xmath1420 here , we have used the fact that @xmath1421 . however , by the empty sum rule , eq [ ex733_5 ] implies that : @xmath1422 last equation allows us to deduce a rich set of identities . for example ,",
    "if @xmath1411 and @xmath1423 , we have the following identity ( compare it with eq [ ex733_2 ] and eq [ ex733_4 ] ) : @xmath1424 similarly , using @xmath1425 or @xmath1426 yield identities such as : @xmath1427 .      throughout previous chapters ,",
    "the focus of summability calculus has been on expressing unique natural generalization to simple and convoluted finite sums using infinitesimal derivatives .",
    "this manifested markedly in the euler - like summation formulas .",
    "starting from chapter [ chapter4 ] , however , the notion of summing or defining divergent series using a regular , stable , and linear method was introduced via a formal definition @xmath47 .",
    "such definition allowed us to expand the real of summability calculus quite naturally to oscillating finite sums , which simplified their analysis considerably , and allowed us to fill many gaps .",
    "while such approach is nearly complete , it is shown in this final chapter that summability calculus can still be expanded even further by expressing almost all its main results alternatively using the language of finite differences . in this chapter ,",
    "summability calculus was used to derive foundational results in the calculus of finite differences such as the discrete definition of derivatives , newton s interpolation formula , and gregory s integration formula .",
    "such results were , in turn , used in conjunction with analytic summability theory to prove a stronger version of the celebrated shannon - nyquist sampling theorem , and to deduce the discrete analog of the many euler - like summation formulas .",
    "in addition , it is illustrated how the calculus of finite differences is indeed a valuable tool in analyzing finite sums ; hence an integral part of summability calculus .",
