    "mesons and baryons at low energies can be described using various effective field theories and models that contain hadrons as degrees of freedom rather than quarks and gluons .",
    "these effective approaches may be based on the linear @xcite or the non - linear @xcite realisation of the @xmath4 ( the so - called _ chiral _ ) symmetry of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with @xmath5 flavours .",
    "the chiral symmetry is broken in two ways : spontaneously , by the presence of the quark condensate @xmath6 @xcite , and explicitely , by the non - zero , non - degenerate quark masses as well as the axial anomaly @xcite . in this paper , we present a linear sigma model with vector and axial - vectors mesons and global chiral symmetry @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be assigned to physical fields according to two different scenarios : ( _ i _ ) they can be identified with the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 [ that form a part of a larger @xmath11 nonet which comprises @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 and @xmath0  resonances below 1 gev ] ; ( _ ii _ ) they can be identified with the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 forming a part of a @xmath11 nonet ( plus a glueball ) that comprises @xmath2 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath3 , @xmath16  resonances above 1 gev ( see also ref .",
    "scalar mesons below 1 gev , whose spectroscopic wave functions possibly contain a dominant tetraquark contribution @xcite , may be introduced in the second scenario as additional scalar fields or may arise as mesonic - molecular states because of interactions of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .    in this paper",

    "finally , the scattering length @xmath87 leads to @xmath88 mev @xcite .",

    "hence , we conclude that the isoscalar meson in our model is most likely not @xmath0 , thus disfavouring this resonance [ and consequently also @xmath93 as a predominantly @xmath11 state",
    ".      the aforementioned problem of the unphysically small two - pion decay width of the sigma meson may be resolved by identifying the fields @xmath7 and @xmath94 of our model with the resonances @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "we are thus left with one free parameter , @xmath103 , that will be varied within the experimentally known band @xcite in order to ascertain whether our result for @xmath104 is in agreement with experimental data . + the two - pion decay width of @xmath105 is represented in fig .",

    "therefore , our results favour @xmath105 as a ( predominantly ) scalar quarkonium .",
    "then the @xmath3 meson ( the decay width of which was used to express @xmath39 via @xmath61 ) is also favoured to be predominantly a @xmath11 state .",

    "a linear sigma model with vector and axial - vector mesons and global chiral invariance has been presented .",
    "the assignment of the fields in the model to the physical states is straightforward in all cases with the exception of the scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "they can be assigned either to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( scenario i ) or to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( scenario ii ) . +",
    "as shown in the previous section , scenario i fails to describe the two - pion decay width of the @xmath108 meson thus disfavouring it , and also @xmath109 , as ( predominantly ) @xmath11 states .",
