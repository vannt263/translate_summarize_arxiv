    "this is due to the fact that particles of similar rigidity @xmath86 propagate in a similar manner in the inter - galactic magnetic field and based on the plausible assumptions that ( i ) a source accelerating particles of charge @xmath9 to energy @xmath87 will accelerate protons to energy @xmath86 , and ( ii ) there are at least as many protons accelerated as there are heavy nuclei .",
    "the anisotropy signal is expected to be stronger at lower energy since the signal increases as the number of particles produced by the source , @xmath88 , while the background increases as the square - root of the number of all observed crs , @xmath89 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",

    "this constraint also sets a lower limit to the rate @xmath82 at which energy should be generated by the source .",
    "the magnetic field carries with it an energy density @xmath117 , and the flow therefore carries with it an energy flux @xmath118 ( some energy is carried also as plasma kinetic energy ) , which implies @xmath119 and therefore @xmath120    another constraint on the source results from the requirement that the acceleration is not suppressed by synchrotron emission of the accelerated particle .",

    "what is the cross section for @xmath22 interaction at high , @xmath237  tev , energy ?",

    "_ at what energy does the flux become dominated by xg sources ? * _ sources . _ are the sources indeed transient ?",

    "are uhecrs accelerated , as suspected , in collisionless ( relativistic ) shocks ?",
    "a theory of such shocks based on basic principles is not yet available ( e.g. @xcite and refernces therein ) .",
    "in addition to the open questions listed above , the physics of the candidate uhecr sources is also not well understood .",
    "as we have shown , uhecr sources are required to produce very large power and are likely to be driving relativistic outflows , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) and  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "these requirements suggest that the sources are powered by the accretion of mass onto black holes , as believed to be the case for grbs and agn .",
    "grbs are most likely powered by the accretion of a fraction of a solar mass on a @xmath160  s time scale onto a newly born solar mass black hole @xcite .",
    "recent observations strongly suggest that the formation of the black hole is associated with the collapse of the core of a very massive star .",
    "agn are believed to be powered by accretion of mass at a rate of @xmath160  solar mass per year onto massive , million to billion solar mass , black holes residing at the centers of distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bhjet ] , the gravitational energy released by the accretion of mass onto the black hole is assumed in both cases to drive a relativistic jet , which travels at nearly the speed of light and produces the observed radiation at a large distance away from the central black hole .",
    "the models describing the physics responsible for powering these objects , though successful in explaining most observations , are largely phenomenological : the mechanism by which the gravitational energy release is harnessed to drive jets , the mechanism of jet collimation and acceleration , and the process of particle acceleration ( and radiation generation ) , are not understood from basic principles . in particular , the answer to the question of whether the jet energy outflow is predominantly electromagnetic or kinetic , which has major implications to our understanding of the mechanism by which the jets are formed , is not known despite many years of photon observations .",
    "these open questions are unlikely to be answered by uhecr observatories alone . for example , given the uncertainties in the high energy @xmath22 cross section , it is not clear that studying shower properties would determine the primary composition .",
    "the composition could be constrained by an energy dependent anisotropy study ( see   [ ssec : aniso ] ) . however , the conclusions of such an analysis would depend on some assumptions regarding the sources @xcite .",
    "in addition , uhecr observatories are unlikely to identify the sources .",
    "although they may provide a conclusive evidence for the correlation between the distribution of uhecr sources and that of matter in the local universe , and possibly discriminate between steady and transient sources ( which may require large exposure that can be provided only by space - born detectors , see ",
    "[ ssec : predictions ] ) , this would not determine which type of objects the sources are .",
    "it should be emphasized that electromagnetic observations are equally unlikely to resolve the open questions : despite many years of observations we are still lacking direct evidence for acceleration of nuclei in any astrophysical object , and fundamental questions related to the physics of the sources ( e.g. the content of relativistic jets ) remain unanswered .",
    "thus , resolving the uhecr puzzles would require a ",
    "multi - messenger \" approach , combining data from uhecr , @xmath196-ray and neutrino detectors .",
    "neutrino astronomy is likely to play an important role in this context : detection of gzk neutrinos ( see   [ ssec : gzk ] ) , combined with accurate measurements of the uhecr flux and spectrum , may allow us to determine the uhecr composition ( and constrain the uhe @xmath22 and neutrino interaction cross sections ) ; detection of high energy neutrino emission from electromagnetically identified sources may allow us to identify the uhecr sources ; neutrino observations will provide new constraints on the physics driving the sources , which can not be obtained using electromagnetic observations , since they can escape from regions which are opaque to electromagnetic radiation ( see   [ ssec : grb_nu ] for examples related to grbs ) .    finally , it should be realized that if the uhecr sources are steady , identifying the sources by directly detecting their neutrino emission is highly improbable , due to the fact that the effective area of a 1  km@xmath13 neutrino detector is @xmath238 at @xmath239  tev , @xmath240 of the area of @xmath56  ev cr detectors (",
