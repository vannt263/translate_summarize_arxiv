    "low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes have been designed recently based on finite geometries and , more generally , balanced incomplete block designs ( bibds ) , see , for example ,  @xcite . one of the main advantages of these structured ldpc codes is that they can lend themselves to very low - complexity encoding , as opposed to random - like ldpc codes .",
    "moreover , experimental results show that the proposed codes perform well with iterative decoding .    in the first part of this paper , we present novel high - rate structured ldpc codes with constant column weights  3 and higher , based on cyclic bibds ( cbibds ) , resolvable bibds ( rbibds ) , and cyclically resolvable cyclic bibds ( crcbibds ) .",
    "we obtain several infinite classes of @xmath0-regular ldpc codes with values of @xmath1 varying from 3 to 8 ( theorems  [ thm_cdf - ldpc codes ] ,  [ thm_rbibd - ldpc codes ] , and  [ thm_crcbibd - ldpc codes ] ) as well as one infinite class of @xmath0-regular ldpc codes for @xmath1 any prime power ( theorem  [ thm_rbibd - ldpc codes_prime ] ) , all admitting flexible choices of @xmath2 and the code length .",
    "the presented results are more general than previous ones .",
    "our proposed ldpc codes have good structural properties , their tanner graphs are free of short cycles of length 4 and have girth 6 .",
    "their code rate is high , achieving @xmath3 or higher already at small block lengths .",
    "this is typically the rate of interest in high - speed applications , for example , in magnetic recording and optical communications channels .",
    "most classes of the constructed codes have a quasi - cyclic ( or similar ) structure , which allows linear - complexity encoding with simple feedback shift registers .",
    "in addition , many classes exhibit very sparse parity - check matrices .",
    "experimental results on decoding performance show that the novel ldpc codes perform very well with the sum - product algorithm  @xcite , significantly better than known bibd - ldpc codes and random gallager ldpc codes  @xcite for short to moderate block lengths ( cf .",
    "[ table_simu1 ] ) .",
    "we observe furthermore , very interestingly , for the proposed codes a performance gain as the column weights grow larger , and a particular good performance of ldpc codes based on crcbibds .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we apply our combinatorial construction techniques to systematic repeat - accumulate ( ra ) codes .",
    "ra codes were first introduced in  @xcite as a serial concatenation of a rate-@xmath4 repetition code and a convolutional code with transfer function @xmath5 , called the accumulator ( fig . [ encoder ] ) . between these two constituent codes , an interleaver permutes the output of the repetition code and in some cases , the encoding scheme is also refined by a rate-@xmath6 combiner .",
    "this combiner performs modulo-2 addition on sets of @xmath6 bits .",
    "here , we consider systematic ra codes ( abbreviated from now on as _ sra codes _ ) , where the message of length @xmath7 is concatenated with the output of the accumulator of length @xmath8 . for a detailed description of the encoding process",
    ", we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the scheme leads to a parity - check matrix of the form @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 matrix with column weight @xmath12 and row weight @xmath6 , and @xmath13 is an @xmath14 double diagonal matrix designated solely by the accumulator  @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath15 is sparse and thus the code can be decoded with the sum - product algorithm in the same way as for ldpc codes .",
    "one drawback of sra codes is that they possess many weight-2 columns in @xmath13 , which has a negative effect on the minimal distance of the code and thus on the decoding performance .",
    "these low - weight columns result solely from the accumulator structure and hence johnson and weller  @xcite have introduced a new accumulator type to increase the weights of these columns .",
    "the new accumulator produces many columns of weight 3 instead of weight 2 and , consequently , the resulting codes are called codes . in the present paper",
    ", we propose a generalized accumulator structure , leading to novel coding schemes , termed _",
    "weight-@xmath12 ra ( wqra ) codes_. this allows code constructions for higher column weights , having the advantage that their parity - check matrices are even more similar to those of regular ldpc codes and thus have a comparable gain in decoding performance ( cf .",
    "[ table_simu2 ] ) .",
    "we note that , while bibds by their axioms can always be used to build up parity - check matrices of sra codes , it is the specific nature of cbibds , rbibds and crcbibds that is exploited to build up parity - check matrices of wqra codes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ ldpc_bibd ] briefly introduces bibds and their usefulness in general ldpc code design .",
    "we give furthermore a short overview of previous results on ldpc code design based on cbibds , rbibds and crcbibds . in section",
    "[ new ] , we extend these previous results and present several novel high - rate ldpc codes with higher column weights . experimental results on decoding performance",

    "we propose a generalized accumulator structure for sra codes , leading to our novel coding schemes of wqra codes .",
    "we develop several code constructions from cbibds , rbibds and crcbibds that are capable of producing such wqra codes .",

    "therefore , we can efficiently derive sra codes or wqra codes with @xmath193 from the underlying difference family in contrast to the construction in subsection  [ subb ] .",
    "let @xmath201 be the column of a matrix which contains consecutive ones at position @xmath31 and @xmath202 .",
    "for sra codes , we have to identify all @xmath201 , @xmath203 , in the incidence matrix of an rbibd for constructing the double diagonal matrix @xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , these columns are spread over different resolution classes and thus , taking these columns for @xmath13 would destroy several classes .",
    "therefore , we propose to build up @xmath13 only from a few resolution classes and let the others unaffected ( fig .",
    "[ kts_parity_check ] ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we can use an arbitrary number of the intact resolution classes to form @xmath10 and hence have more flexibility in the code design .",
    "it is important to omit only complete resolution classes , because we then remove a definite number of ones per row which ensures the regularity of the resulting parity - check matrix .",
    "johnson and weller rely on the construction of ray - chaudhuri and wilson  @xcite for generating an @xmath204 , also called a kirkman triple system ( kts ) .",
    "the last three resolution classes of the kts have a special structure consisting of circulant submatrices .",
    "these classes can be transformed into a double diagonal matrix for sra codes with simple row and column permutations  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath205\\ ] ] be the last three resolution classes , where every class is vertically divided into three circulant submatrices @xmath206 , which are cyclic shifts by @xmath31 places of the @xmath207 identity matrix .",
    "johnson and weller first replace @xmath208 and @xmath209 with all zeros matrices and then permute it into a double diagonal matrix , where the row permutations must be applied to the entire incidence matrix .",
    "finally , an arbitrary number of the remaining resolution classes can be used to form @xmath10 .",
    "we propose here not to replace the submatrices @xmath208 and @xmath209 with zero matrices , but to keep the entries in @xmath210 .",
    "with the same permutations we obtain the parity - check matrix of a w3ra code , where @xmath193 and @xmath211 arise from the construction .",
    "codes from crcbibds combine the resolvability of rbibds and the cyclic character of cbibds , so that we gain the specific advantages of both code classes .",
    "the cyclic structure enables linear - complexity encoding , while we have the flexibility of rbibds to adjust the length and rate of the code independently by removing an arbitrary number of resolution classes .",
    "although the resulting crcbibd codes are not quasi - cyclic , we may realize linear - complexity encoding either by a modified scheme of feedback shift registers as proposed in  @xcite or by employing the encoder of an sra code .",
    "for the latter , there is no need to maintain the quasi - cyclic structure of the parity - check matrix and we thus may use an arbitrary selection of the resolution classes for designing the code .      with the construction of genma , mishima and jimbo  @xcite",
    ", we can obtain a crcbibd@xmath212 with @xmath85 prime and @xmath1 odd , if there exists an rdf@xmath213 .",
    "in their proof , they construct all base blocks of the design and use them to partition the design into resolution classes . for our purpose to construct sra codes , we need one of the resolution classes given by @xmath214 and its class orbit @xmath215 where @xmath63 is a suitable subset of @xmath216 .",
    "the class orbit @xmath217 consists of @xmath1 resolution classes , which are cyclic shifts of each other .",
    "let @xmath210 be the incidence matrix of this class orbit .",
    "now let @xmath218 be the position of an arbitrary 1-entry in @xmath210 and @xmath219 be the vertical distance to the next 1-entry in column @xmath220 ( fig .",
    "[ crcbibd_trans ] ) .",
    "it must hold that @xmath221 , otherwise we have to choose another 1-entry with different @xmath219 .",
    "furthermore let @xmath222 be a permutation vector for the rows of @xmath210 , where @xmath223 $ ] is the value at position @xmath224 .",
    "now we compute @xmath225=x_1+\\delta ( i-1 ) \\pmod{pk}\\ ] ] and apply the permutation to the rows of the entire incidence matrix . here",
    "we consider only the partial matrix @xmath226 corresponding to @xmath210 ( fig .",
    "[ crcbibd_trans ] ) .",
    "for @xmath226 it holds that    1 .",
    "there exists exactly one column @xmath201 with 1-entries at row @xmath31 and @xmath202 ( mod @xmath227 ) for every @xmath224 , and 2 .",
    "all @xmath201 are distinct .",
    "the column @xmath220 of @xmath210 with 1-entries at rows @xmath228 and @xmath229 gives the column @xmath230 of @xmath226 . because of the cyclic resolvability there must be a resolution class with a column @xmath231 that contains 1-entries at rows @xmath232 ( mod @xmath227 ) and @xmath233 ( mod @xmath227 ) , @xmath234 . with @xmath235",
    ", we have @xmath236 and hence we never use a row twice .",
    "the columns @xmath231 result in @xmath237 of @xmath226 and thus we have @xmath238 for every @xmath31 . moreover , @xmath201 must be unique , because there can only exist one column with 1-entries at rows @xmath239 ( mod @xmath227 ) and @xmath240 ( mod @xmath227 ) , @xmath241 , due to the axioms of the design .",
    "the columns @xmath242 must be distinct because the blocks of @xmath214 can never have two pairs of entries with difference @xmath219 due to constructional reasons . thus , the resulting @xmath201 must be distinct .",
    "finally , we can transform @xmath226 into a double diagonal matrix by simple column reordering and deleting the superfluous ones .",
    "we can even obtain wqra codes with an arbitrary design parameter @xmath170 with the restriction that @xmath243 .",
    "for this , we modify our computation to @xmath244=x_1+\\delta ( i-1 ) \\pmod{pk},\\ 1\\leq i \\leq pk.\\ ] ]      in this section , we compare the decoding performance of sra codes , wqra codes and regular ldpc codes for our new constructions ( fig .",
    "[ table_simu2 ] ) .",
    "these codes differ solely in the @xmath13-part of their parity - check matrices and thus , the largest differences in performance are expected for short to moderate block lengths or for lower code rates , as in these cases the impact of @xmath13 is relatively higher than that of @xmath10 . for the decoding we use the sum - product algorithm  @xcite on an awgn channel with a maximum of 50 iterations per codeword .",
    "the ldpc codes are again described by a quadruple @xmath147 $ ] , and the sra / wqra codes by a slightly different quadruple @xmath245 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the column weight of @xmath10 .",
    "the first plot of fig .  [ table_simu2 ] demonstrates the performance gain of a new low - rate w3ra code at relatively small block length , compared to the sra and ldpc code of the same parameters . in the second plot ,",
    "our w5ra - code shows a similarly well low - snr performance as the corresponding sra code and the excellent high - snr performance as the ldpc code .",
    "the sra code suffers a high error - floor at approximately 3.75  db , arising from many weight-2 columns in the parity - check matrix .",
    "this error - floor turns out stronger compared to the first plot , since we reduced the column weights of the @xmath13-part from 5 ( instead of 3 ) to 2 in order to obtain a double diagonal matrix .",
    "consequently , the larger decrease of the column weights negatively affects the decoding performance in the error - floor region .",
    "the third plot demonstrates the performance gain of our novel w3ra codes compared to the sra codes of johnson and weller , for various codes of rate 0.85 and block lengths varying from 1220 to 3020 .",
    "the fourth plot shows a particular good high - snr performance of our w5ra - code compared to the corresponding sra and ldpc code .",
    "we have designed in this paper new classes of structured ldpc codes with high code rate and low - complexity encoding . based on specific classes of bibds",
    ", we obtained several infinite classes of @xmath0-regular ldpc codes with values of @xmath1 varying from 3 to 8 as well as an infinite class of @xmath0-regular ldpc codes for @xmath1 any prime power , all admitting flexible choices of @xmath2 and the code length .",
    "we have furthermore addressed sra codes , proposing a generalized accumulator structure for higher column weights that replaces the conventional accumulator and leads to an encoding scheme , we have termed weight-@xmath12 ra code .",
    "this allowed an improved decoding performance closer to those of regular ldpc codes , along with the low encoding complexity of turbo - like codes .",
    "compared to sra codes , the relatively high error floors could be lowered significantly .",
    "the encoding scheme is applicable to our new construction techniques and may be used for further combinatorial constructions that lack an efficient encoding .",
    "the presented constructions arise from cyclic and resolvable bibds and allows to use an arbitrary number of block orbits or resolution classes for more flexibility in the code design .",
    "therefore , we can adjust the rate and length of the codes independently and thus produce a wider range of codes . the proposed novel ldpc and systematic ra codes in this paper offer good structural properties , perform very well with the sum - product algorithm , and are suitable for applications , e.g. , in high - speed applications in magnetic recording and optical communications channels .",
    "let @xmath85 be a prime .",
    "we first assume that @xmath1 is odd .",
    "then , by a result of genma , mishima and jimbo  @xcite , a @xmath123 exists , whenever there is an @xmath68 .",
    "the following infinite ( ( i)-(iii ) ) and finite ( ( iv ) ) families of radical difference families are known ( cf .",

    "an @xmath246 exists for all primes @xmath66 ( mod @xmath247 ) .",

    ". then an @xmath248 exists if and only if @xmath125 is not a @xmath126-th power in @xmath69 , or equivalently @xmath127 is not a @xmath126-th power in @xmath69 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath249 be a prime and let @xmath130 be a @xmath83-th primitive root of unity in @xmath69 .",

    "an @xmath251 exists for all primes @xmath252 displayed in table  [ table_rdf ] .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite a recursive construction is given that implies the existence of a @xmath138 whenever @xmath142 is a product of primes of the form @xmath66 ( mod @xmath51 ) .",

    "the index @xmath265 indicates the position of the desired block @xmath171 containing the difference 1 .",
