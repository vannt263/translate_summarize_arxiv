    "however we have a lot of freedom in the choice of these parameters because we still do not know much about these processes , so further study on high energy emission from pulsars is needed in order to confirm or reject the pulsar hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless a dark matter interpretation of the @xmath0 lat and of the pamela data is still an open possibility .",
    "figure [ fig : mod1 ] shows the parameter space of dark matter particle mass versus pair - annihilation rate , for models where dark matter annihilates into monochromatic @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the preferred range for the dark matter mass lies between 400 gev and 1 - 2 tev , with larger masses increasingly constrained by the h.e.s.s .",
    "results @xcite .",
    "the required annihilation rates , when employing a particular dark matter density profile imply typical boost factors ranging between 20 and 100 , when compared to the value @xmath11 expected for a thermally produced dark matter particle relic .    how can one distinguish between the contributions of pulsars and dark matter annihilations ?",
    "most likely , a confirmation of the dark matter signal will require a consistency between different experiments and new measurements of the reported excesses with large statistics .",
    "the observed excess in the positron fraction should be consistent with corresponding signals in absolute positron and electron fluxes in the pamela data and all lepton data collected by @xmath0 lat .",
    "@xmath0 lat has a large effective area and long projected lifetime , 5 years nominal with a 10 years goal , which makes it an excellent detector of cosmic - ray electrons up to @xmath121 tev .",
    "future @xmath0 lat measurements of the total lepton flux with large statistics will enable distinguishing a gradual change in slope as opposed to a sharp cutoff with high confidence @xcite .",
    "the latter can be an indication in favor of the dark matter hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is to look for anisotropies in the arrival directions of the electrons .",
    "the @xmath0 lat ) detected more than 1.6 million cosmic - ray electrons / positrons with energies above 60  gev during its first year of operation .",
    "the arrival directions of these events were searched for anisotropies of angular scale extending from @xmath1210@xmath13 up to 90@xmath13 , and of minimum energy extending from 60  gev up to 480  gev .",
    "an upper limit for the dipole anisotropy has been set to 0.5 - 10% depending on the energy @xcite .",
    "the levels of anisotropy expected for vela - like and monogem - like sources ( i.e. sources with similar distances and ages ) seem to be greater than the scale of anisotropies excluded by the results ( see figure [ anisotropy_f ] ) .",
    "however , it is worth to point out that the model results are affected by large uncertainties related to the choice of the free parameters .",
    "a strong leptonic signal should be accompanied by a boost in the @xmath14-ray yield providing a distinct spectral signature detectable by @xmath0 lat .",
    "the galactic center ( gc ) is expected to be the strongest source of @xmath14-rays from dm annihilation , due to its coincidence with the cusped part of the dm halo density profile @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the data , taken during the first 11 months of the fermi satellite operations , is shown in figures [ gc_fig ] and [ gc_r_fig ] .",
    "the reported results were obtained with a binned likelihood analysis , performed by means of the tools developed by the @xmath0 lat collaboration ( gtlike , from the fermi analysis tools @xcite ) .    in order to analyze the diffuse and point - source gamma - ray emission in this region using a maximum likelihood method for the lat data , a model of the already known sources and the diffuse background should be built .",
    "the model in use for the presented analysis contains 11 sources in the @xmath0 1 year catalog @xcite which are located within or very close to the considered region being analyzed .",
    "these sources have a point - like spatial model and a spectrum in the form of a power - law .",
    "the model also contains the diffuse gamma - ray background which is made of two components : 1 ) _ the galactic diffuse gamma - ray background_. the observed galactic diffuse emission was modeled by means of the galprop code ( model number 87xexphs ) @xcite and @xcite .",

    "it is modeled as an isotropic emission with a template spectrum .",
    "the diffuse gamma - ray backgrounds and discrete sources , as we know them today , can account for the large majority of the detected gamma - ray emission from the galactic center .",
    "nevertheless a residual emission is left , not accounted for by the above models @xcite .    improved modeling of the galactic diffuse model as well as",
    "the potential contribution from other astrophysical sources ( for instance unresolved point sources ) could provide a better description of the data .",
    "analyses are underway to investigate these possibilities .",
    "an excess in gamma - ray from dark matter annihilation also should be seen in the galactic diffuse spectrum .",
    "figure  [ diffuse ] shows the lat data averaged over all galactic longitudes and the latitude range @xmath15 .",
    "the hatched band surrounding the lat data indicates the systematic uncertainty in the measurement due to the uncertainty in the effective area .",
    "also shown on the right are the egret data for the same region of sky where one can see that the lat - measured spectrum is significantly softer than the egret measurement @xcite .",
    "figure  [ diffuse2 ] compares the lat spectrum with the spectra of an _ a priori _ diffuse galactic emission ( dge ) model .",
    "while the lat spectral shape is consistent with the dge model used in this paper , the overall model emission is too low thus giving rise to a @xmath16% excess over the energy range 100 mev to 10 gev .",
    "however , the dge model is based on pre-@xmath0 lat data and knowledge of the dge .",
    "the difference between the model and data is of the same order as the uncertainty in the measured cr nuclei spectra at the relevant energies .",
    "overall , the agreement between the lat - measured spectrum and the model shows that the fundamental processes are consistent with our data , thus providing a solid basis for future work in understanding the dge .",

    "local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies , the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold dark matter scenario , are attractive targets for dark matter indirect searches because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter dominated environments . with the data taken during the first 11 months no significant @xmath14-ray emission was detected above 100 mev from any dwarf galaxies .",
    "so we can determine upper limits to the @xmath14-ray flux assuming both power - law spectra and representative spectra from wimp annihilation .",
    "the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained to be at a level below around @xmath17 photons @xmath18s@xmath19 @xcite . using recent stellar kinematic data ,",
    "the @xmath14-ray flux limits can be combined with improved determinations of the dark matter density profiles in 8 of the 14 candidate dwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross - section of wimps in several widely studied extensions of the standard model , including its supersymmetric extension and other models that received recent attention . with the present data we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermal relic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps ( neutralinos here )",
    "are dominantly produced non - thermally , e.g. in models where supersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation .",
    "these @xmath14-ray limits also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the @xmath0 lat and pamela @xmath20 data , including low - mass wino - like neutralinos and models with tev masses pair - annihilating into muon - antimuon pairs .",
    "the same kind of analysis can be made for the clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally a line at the wimp mass , due to the 2@xmath14 production channel , could be observed as a feature in the astrophysical source spectrum @xcite .",
    "such an observation would be a `` smoking gun '' for wimp dm as it is difficult to explain by a process other than wimp annihilation or decay and the presence of a feature due to annihilation into @xmath21 in addition would be even more convincing .    up to now however no lines vave",
    "been observed and we obtain @xmath14-ray line flux upper limits in the range @xmath22 @xcite and corresponding dm annihilation cross - section and decay lifetime limits shown in figures [ lines ] and [ lines_decay ] .",
    "fermi gamma - ray space telescope has opened a new era in dm searches and a large variety of analyses have been developed for clusters of galaxies , dm satellites , dm subhalos , cosmological dm and spectral lines .",
    "no significant detections have been made , but constraints that start to probe the available phase space have been put on the annihilation cross - section and decay lifetimes .",
    "in addition , several ongoing analyses are now being finalized , including studies of the complicated galactic center region .",
    "the cre spectrum measured by @xmath0 lat is significantly harder than what was expected on the basis of previous data . adopting the presence of an extra @xmath4 primary component with @xmath12 2.4 spectral index and @xmath23 tev allows a consistent interpretation of the @xmath0 lat cre data , hess and pamela .",
    "such an extra - component can be produced by nearby pulsars for a reasonable choice of relevant parameters or by annihilating dark matter for models with @xmath24 1 tev .",
    "improved analysis and complementary observations ( cre anisotropy , spectrum and angular distribution of diffuse @xmath14 , dm sources search in @xmath14 ) are required to possibly discriminate the right scenario . the dark matter origin of any exotic signal has to be confirmed by complementary findings in @xmath14-rays by @xmath0 lat and atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , and by lhc in the debris of high - energy proton destructions . on the other hand , if the signal is due to to be a conventional astrophysical source of cosmic rays , it will mean a direct detection of particles accelerated at an astrophysical source , again a major breakthrough .",
    "however , independent of the origin of these excesses , exotic or conventional , we can expect a very exciting several years ahead of us .",
