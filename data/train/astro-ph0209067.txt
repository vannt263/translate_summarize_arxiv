    "starbursts are the site where most of the high - mass star formation occurs .",
    "they appear in disks , in bulges and in the nuclei of different types ( e.g. , spirals , irregulars , or dwarfs ) of nearby and distant galaxies .",
    "terlevich ( 1997 ) defined starburst galaxies as objects in which the energy output of the starburst dominates that of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , starbursts play a major role in the processes of evolution and formation of galaxies due to their high star - formation activity . they constitute ideal laboratories to investigate some key issues : the formation and evolution of massive stars ; the feedback between the interstellar medium and the star formation processes ; or the star formation and chemical evolution of the universe .",
    "one important question is which stars form in starbursts .",
    "the amount of mass transformed into stars and the mass range of the newly formed stars determine the period of time over which a galaxy can support a starburst phase , and therefore the effect of starbursts on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "thus , it is crucial to know if starbursts have an extreme initial mass function ( imf ) with respect to more quiescent systems .",
    "numerous studies performed in the last few years suggest that the imf has an universal nature , having a slope close to salpeter for a mass range between 5  m@xmath2 and 60  m@xmath2 ( e.g. , references in gilmore & howell 1998 ) .",
    "however , the imf in starbursts is still not well known , in particular in high - metallicity environments .",
    "contradictory results have been presented .",
    "an extreme imf for starbursts was suggested by rieke et al .",
    "( 1980 ) in a pioneering work on m82 .",
    "they proposed a _",
    "top heavy _",
    "imf ( with a deficit of stars below 3    8  m@xmath2 ) to explain the mass - luminosity ratio estimated from k - band photometry and a dynamical mass measurement .",
    "this imf includes a higher fraction of red supergiant stars over red giants and dwarfs than expected for a normal imf .",
    "their results have been confirmed by rieke et al .",
    "satyapal et al . (",
    "1997 ) and foerster - schreiber ( 2000 ) accounted for the k - band luminosity with a salpeter imf and ascribe this apparently discrepant result to the complex morphology of m82 and to dust obscuration in the starburst .",
    "the analysis of the nebular optical+near - infrared ( ir ) lines indicates the suppression of stars more massive than 30  m@xmath2 ( goldader et al .",
    "1997 ; bresolin , kennicutt , & garnett 1999 ; coziol , doyon , & demers 2001 ) .",
    "thornley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used the mid - infrared line ratio of [ neiii]@xmath315.6/[neii]@xmath312.8 to measure the hardness of the stellar ionizing radiation .",
    "they found that , on average , stars with masses above about 40  m@xmath2 are not present in starburst galaxies , either because they were never formed or because they already have disappeared as a result of aging effects .",
    "a complication of the interpretation of [ neiii]/[neii ] are the uncertain stellar evolution models at high metallicity . as pointed out by thornley et al .",
    ", observations of gas and stars in the galactic center suggest a disagreement between the tracks and the observations , which may be related to the difficulty of defining mass loss , atmospheres , and effective temperatures for metal - rich stars .    on the other hand ,",
    "the uv - optical continuum from the integrated spectrum of starbursts suggests the formation of such massive stars ( leitherer 1996 ; schaerer 2000 ; gonzlez delgado 2001 ) .",
    "this technique has the advantage of probing the stellar light from massive o stars directly , as opposed to a nebular analysis which relies on an indirect measure of the stellar radiation . using wr - star features , schaerer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that a salpeter imf extending to masses @xmath4  @xmath5  40  m@xmath2 is compatible with the wr - star census observed in metal - rich starbursts .",
    "a similar conclusion has been obtained by bresolin & kennicutt ( 2002 ) and by pindao et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based on the detection of wr features in high - metallicity hii regions .",
    "most of the results on the imf have been obtained from a limited number of constraints , through the modeling of a few starburst properties at a specific wavelength .",
    "these results can depend strongly on the model ingredients .",
    "in particular , the evolutionary synthesis models used to analyze the uv+optical+near - ir properties of the starbursts depend on the stellar tracks , atmospheres , and libraries ( see the discussion in schaerer 2000 ) . in addition , the modeling of the nebular lines depends on the assumptions of the gas geometry , the electron density structure , and the chemical composition of the gas .",
    "thus , inclusion of as many different starburst properties as possible is required for a determination of the imf .",
    "we have obtained uv and optical spectra and images of the starburst galaxy ngc  3049 with space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to investigate the possible evidence of depletion of massive stars in metal - rich starbursts .",
    "ngc  3049 is a barred spiral galaxy , sb(rs)ab , in the virgo cluster , known as mrk  710 in the markarian & lipovetskii ( 1976 ) catalog .",
    "it is also classified as a nuclear starburst ( balzano 1983 ) , a wr galaxy ( conti 1991 ) and an hii galaxy ( terlevich et al .",
    "kunth & schild ( 1986 ) first reported the detection of broad emission features at niii @xmath34640 and heii @xmath34686 produced by wr stars .",
    "more recently , schaerer , contini , & kunth ( 1999 ) reported the detection of broad civ @xmath35808 indicating the presence of wc in addition to late wn stars in the starburst .",
    "due to its nebular emission lines and wr features , ngc  3049 has been observed intensively in the past ( e.g. masegosa , moles , & del olmo 1991 ; vacca & conti 1992 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; contini 1996 ; guseva , izotov , & thuan 2000 ) .",
    "ngc  3049 is very bright in the far - ir ( @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 ; heckman et al .",
    "1998 ) and at uv wavelengths ( kinney et al .",
    "its iue spectrum suggests a young stellar population dominating the central ( 20@xmath810 arcsec ) emission ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) .",
    "optical images show extended recent star formation along the bar ( mazzarella & boronson 1993 ; contini et al .",
    "1997 ; schaerer et al .",
    "molecular gas has been detected at the center of the galaxy , but no dense gas as traced by the hcn or cs molecules was found ( contini et al .",
    "the oxygen abundance of the nucleus has been estimated by the _ strong line _",
    "semi - empirical methods because auroral lines ( e.g. , [ oiii ] @xmath34363 , [ nii ] @xmath35755 , [ siii ] @xmath36312 ) that are used as electron temperature diagnostics have not been detected in the spectrum .",
    "these methods rely , e.g. , on @xmath9=([oii]@xmath33727+[oiii]@xmath35007)/h@xmath10 or [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath11 to derive a supersolar oxygen abundance .",
    "vacca & conti ( 1992 ) give @xmath12(o / h )  =  9.08 , storchi - bergmann et al . ( 1994 ) give 8.87 , guseva et al .",
    "( 2000 ) give 9.03 , and contini ( 1996 ) gives 9.05 calibration of edmund & pagel ( 1984 ) or the relation between the oxygen abundance and the [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath11 ratio derived by van zee et al ( 1998 ) , that was obtained also using the edmund & pagel calibration ] .",
    "even considering the uncertainties associated with these methods , we are confident that the metallicity in the nucleus of ngc  3049 is supersolar ( @xmath12(o / h )  @xmath13 ) .    ngc  3049 has been chosen for this project because previous wfpc ( pre - costar ) images at uv wavelengths indicate a relatively simple morphology , with the uv flux dominated by one extremely bright star cluster .",
    "this morphology minimizes geometry effect and it makes it easier to study the relation between the stellar and the nebular spectrum , and to search for evidence of an extreme imf in ngc  3049 . in addition , our goal is to perform a critical test of the most sophisticated hot - star models currently available to predict the uv stellar properties and the optical nebular lines in metal - rich starbursts .",
    "our work is organized as follows : the observations and data reduction are in section  2 ; in section  3 , we describe the morphology of the uv and optical emission ; sections  4 to 6 deal with the analysis and interpretation of the uv light , uv - optical continuum , and nebular optical lines , respectively .",
    "the summary and conclusions are in section  7 .",
    "we obtained uv and optical spectra and images of ngc  3049 with stis on board the hst during two visits . in the first visit , on 1998 november 4 , ngc  3049 was imaged in the far - uv with the fuv - mama detector through the filter f25srf2 ( @xmath14   ) , and at optical wavelengths with the ccd detector through the filters f28@xmath850lp ( @xmath15   ) and f28@xmath850oiii ( @xmath165007   ) .",
    "the total integration time was 900  s in the far - uv .",
    "in the optical , the total integration time of 240  s ( with the optical longpass filter ) and 948  s ( with the [ oiii ] filter ) was split in 4 and 2 individual exposures , respectively .",
    "the spatial sampling of the fuv - mama and ccd detectors is 0.0244 arcsec / pixel and 0.05 arcsec / pixel , respectively .",
    "the individual images were calibrated with the standard stsci pipeline , and they were combined with the cosmic - reject command to generate an individual image in the uv and optical ( mainly h@xmath11 plus red continuum ) , and at [ oiii ] plus the underlying continuum .    in the second visit , on 1999 january 18 , uv and optical spectra of the central region of ngc  3049 were taken .",
    "we used the stis / fuv - mama detector with a 52@xmath80.5 arcsec slit and the g140l grating .",
    "a total integration time of 11064  s was split in four individual exposures .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range of 1150    1700    with a dispersion of 0.6   / pixel , giving a minimum spectral resolution of @xmath01     ( for point sources , and larger , up to @xmath012   for extended sources ) . at optical wavelengths , the stis / ccd detector was used with a 52@xmath80.1 arcsec slit .",

    "this exposure was split in two individual sub - exposures as well .",
    "the spectral resolution of the optical spectra is 4  ",
    "5.4    and 0.8    1.1    in the blue and red , respectively . the slit was centered on the brightest nuclear knot and oriented along the bar at p.a .",

    "extend over more than 8  arcsec with a scale of 0.0244  arcsec / pixel at the uv continuum , and 11  arcsec with a scale of 0.05  arcsec / pixel at the h@xmath11 line .",
    "the individual spectra were first calibrated with the standard stsci pipeline .",
    "then , the calibrated frames were combined to produce a single two - dimensional spectrum at uv , blue , and red optical wavelengths .",
    "we have subtracted a one - dimensional spectrum obtained from the outer part of the uv 2d frame to correct the uv spectrum for the strong geocoronal emission at ly@xmath11 and oi @xmath31302 .",
    "this spectrum has only a very weak continuum plus the ly@xmath11 and oi and is a good approximation for a sky spectrum .",
    "all the spectra have been treated as extended continuum sources when converting from surface brightness units in the 2d frames to flux units ( erg  s@xmath7  @xmath18  @xmath7 ) .",
    "finally , the spectra have been de - redshifted assuming a heliocentric radial velocity of 1494  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we have retrieved narrowband h@xmath11 and nearby continuum images from the data archive of the isaac newton group of telescopes ( ing , la palma ) .",
    "the galaxy was observed on 2001 january 1 with the 1.0  m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) using a 2088@xmath82120 sit ccd as a detector , with a spatial sampling of 0.33  arcsec / pixel , through an h@xmath11 ( @xmath19   , fwhm  =  44   ) and a nearby continuum filter ( @xmath20   , fwhm  =  44   ) .",
    "the integration time was 2400  s in each filter , split in two exposures .",

    "( note , however , that this image contains also part of the [ nii ] emission ) .",
    "the final image is displayed in figure  1 .",
    "the jkt h@xmath11 image reveals that most of the emission is along the bar and some arcs that emerge from the ends of the bar with a ring - like appearance of 30  arcsec radius ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the highest h@xmath11 surface brightness is at the center of the stellar bar , the nucleus of the galaxy , and at 10  arcsec north - east .",
    "the central 20@xmath820 arcsec far - uv and optical hst images of ngc  3049 are in figure  2 .",
    "both images show extended emission along the bar , with a similar appearance .",
    "however , a clear difference between the two images is the emission at @xmath02  arcsec ne , which is brighter at optical than at uv wavelengths .",
    "this could be due to an older stellar population contributing to the red - optical continuum or due to higher obscuration in the ne dimming the uv emission .",
    "the magnitude in the hst system measured in a circular aperture of 0.25  arcsec radius ( 10  arcsec ) is 14.67 and 17.60 ( 13.40 and 14.45 ) at uv and optical wavelengths , respectively .",
    "table  1 gives the uv and optical magnitudes of ngc  3049 as a function of the distance obtained from the circular aperture photometry in the uv and optical images .",
    "an expansion of the central 4@xmath84  arcsec of ngc  3049 is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the [ oiii ] plus the underlying continuum image is reproduced in this figure as well .",
    "the three images suggest that the nuclear starburst is compact , and most of the emission is dominated by a very bright central cluster .",
    "however , at least 6 clusters , much weaker , are also detected in the center of the galaxy .",
    "the observed properties of these clusters are in table  2 .",
    "( the location and precise extraction areas are shown in figures  3 and 4 ) .",
    "the similarity between the uv and optical central morphology indicates that there is not much obscuration at the nucleus of ngc  3049 .",
    "it looks like hot stars and ionizing gas can be described by a simple geometry .",
    "thus , we expect that the effect of the geometry on the modeling of the nebular lines should be small .",
    "figure  4 shows the integrated uv flux as a function of the slit position .",
    "the uv flux is dominated by the central cluster , but there are other sources embedded in the extended diffuse emission within the central @xmath02.5  arcsec , as clearly shown in the uv image ( figure  3 ) . as expected from the morphology of the images , the integrated optical continuum ( near h@xmath11 ) and the h@xmath11 emission",
    "have a spatial distribution similar to the uv flux .    as a compromise between signal - to - noise and spectral resolution ,",
    "we have obtained the uv spectra with a slit width of 0.5  arcsec , larger than the 0.1  arcsec width used in the optical spectra . to check the effect of the different slit widths used , we have extracted the spatial profile along p.a .",
    "=  @xmath17 in the uv and optical images , simulating a slit of width 0.1 and 0.5  arcsec .",
    "both profiles follow the same spatial distribution , and the spectrum of the central 0.3  arcsec is hardly affected by the slit width mismatch because the central cluster dominating the emission is very compact .",
    "the fwhm of the spatial profile corresponding to the central knot is only 0.14 and 0.12  arcsec in the optical and uv images , respectively .",
    "of course , outside the central cluster , the uv and optical slits are not sampling the same spatial distribution .",
    "several one - dimensional spectra have been extracted .",
    "the windows used at the uv wavelengths are marked in figure  4 .",
    "the corresponding one - dimensional red and blue optical spectra ( a and b ) have been also extracted .",
    "figures  5 and 6 show these spectra .",
    "the uv spectrum is dominated by absorption lines formed in the interstellar medium , in the winds , and in the photosphere of massive stars .",
    "the main interstellar lines detected in the nuclear spectrum of ngc  3049 are siii @xmath31260 , oi+siii @xmath31302 , cii @xmath31335 , siii @xmath31526 , feii @xmath31608 , and alii @xmath31670 ; the wind lines are nv @xmath31240 , siiv @xmath31400 , and civ @xmath31550 , ( but heii @xmath31640 is not clearly detected ) ; and the photospheric lines are ov @xmath31371 , fev @xmath313601380 , siiii @xmath31417 , ciii @xmath31427 , and sv @xmath31501 .",
    "the strength of the photospheric lines and the p  cygni profile of the wind lines indicates that a young powerful starburst dominates the uv light .",
    "the optical spectra show a strong blue continuum provided by young ( o and b ) stars , and broad emission lines at @xmath214660   from wr stars .",
    "no absorption lines from an older stellar population have been detected ; thus , the optical continuum is only produced by the very young starburst as seen at the uv .",
    "the contribution from the bulge population is negligible through this narrow slit .",
    "the optical spectra show nebular lines from the balmer series such as h@xmath11 , h@xmath10 and h@xmath22 , low ionization lines such as [ oii ] @xmath33727 , [ nii ] @xmath36584,6543 , [ sii ] @xmath36717,6731 , and the high - excitation line [ oiii]@xmath35007 .",
    "as expected , broad emission lines due to wr stars are detected in the stis blue optical spectrum at @xmath04660   .",
    "the stis red spectrum does not cover the range 5700  ",
    "therefore we can not confirm the detection of the red wr bump at 5810   , which was previously detected from ground - based observations ( schaerer et al .",
    "1999 ; guseva et al .",
    "2000 ) . the blue bump is mainly formed by the blend of niii @xmath346204640 , ciii @xmath34650+civ @xmath34658 and heii @xmath34686 ( figure  6 ) .",
    "nv @xmath34604 or niv @xmath34507 are not detected , but a weak siiii @xmath345524576 blend may be present .",
    "this implies that late wn and early and late wc stars are the dominant wr stellar population .",
    "however , the weak siiii blend indicates that some early wn stars can also be present . the detection of ciii @xmath34650 , @xmath35696 ( schaerer et al .",
    "1999 ) suggests a supersolar metallicity of the starburst because late - type wc stars are only seen in high - metallicity regions ( smith et al .",
    "1991 ; phillips & conti 1992 ) .",
    "no _ nebular _ heii @xmath34686 is detected in the spectra . however , considering that this line is 0.01    0.025 the intensity of h@xmath10 ( guseva et al .",

    "we have not unambiguously detected _ broad _ heii @xmath31640 in the stis uv spectra , either .",
    "this line must be present , given the presence of the stellar @xmath34686 line .",
    "however , this region is at the edge of the wavelength coverage of the far - uv spectrum , where the s / n is lower and where the continuum placement is challenging .",
    "we have measured the 4660    bump in each pixel along the spatial direction to trace the spatial distribution of the wr stars .",
    "we find that the flux of the bump peaks at the maximum of the nearby optical continuum .",
    "consequently the wr stars have the same spatial distribution as the main sequence stars .",
    "the bump is only detected in 6  pixels ( @xmath00.3  arcsec ) , indicating a very compact spatial distribution of the wr stars .",
    "the total flux of the bump ( between 4600 and 4720   ) is @xmath23  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath18 , and the equivalent width is @xmath014   .",
    "this flux is a factor of 2 lower than the flux measured in ground - based observations ( schaerer et al .",
    "1999 ) with an aperture of 2  arcsec .",
    "however , given the sharp spatial distribution of the wr bump and the continuum , we do not think that differences in fluxes can be produced by a more extended wr stellar population .",
    "the fluxes of the ground - based spectra have quoted uncertainties of about 30% .",
    "therefore we believe that the discrepancy between the hst and ground - based data is the result of observational uncertainties .",
    "we note that the equivalent widths agree rather well , with the hst value being somewhat larger than the ground - based value of 11   .",
    "we constructed the ionized gas velocity curve by fitting a gaussian to the h@xmath11 emission line detected along the stellar bar , out to @xmath24  arcsec south - west and + 11  arcsec north - east of the nucleus ( defined as the peak of the optical continuum ) .",

    "the general large - scale shape is in good agreement with schaerer et al .",
    "however , our data show more kinematic structure in the central 2  arcsec ( figure  7b ) . at 0.5  arcsec north - east of the nucleus ,",
    "the gas is blueshifted by 100  km  s@xmath7 , and at 1  arcsec , the gas has again the nuclear velocity .",
    "therefore , the gas is both approaching and receding along the line of sight by 100  km  s@xmath7  within a spatial scale of 1  arcsec .",
    "two kinematic components are resolved and extended by 0.4  arcsec south - west of the nucleus , and by 0.1  arcsec at 0.6  arcsec north - east .",
    "these two components are also detected in [ nii ] @xmath36584,6548 ( figure  8) , but not in h@xmath10 or [ oiii ] . in the south - west , the second weaker component is blueshifted by @xmath060  km  s@xmath7  with respect to the main brightest component with a velocity of 1600  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this component may represent a bubble powered by the winds from the massive stars .",
    "other evidence of the interaction of massive stars with the interstellar medium comes from the uv interstellar lines .",
    "some of these lines are detected at zero redshift ( in the observed spectrum _ a _ and _ b _ ) , and thus are associated with gas in the milky way .",
    "however , other lines , such as siii @xmath31260 , oi+siii @xmath31303 , cii @xmath31335 , and siii @xmath31526 , form in the interstellar medium of the starburst .",
    "we have measured the radial velocity of siii @xmath31260 and cii @xmath31335 with respect to the milky way ( mw ) lines .",
    "their radial velocities indicate blueshifts of about 210  km  s@xmath7  with respect to the redshift given in ned and about 300  km  s@xmath7  with respect to the radial velocity measured in the nebular ionized gas .",
    "thus , the warm interstellar gas in the nuclear starburst of ngc  3049 is outflowing by 200    300  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "outflows with similar velocities have been detected in other starburst galaxies ( e.g. , gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ; kunth et al . 1998 ; johnson et al .",
    "the absorption lines formed in the wind of massive stars are driven by radiation pressures ; their profiles depend on the luminosity of the star ( castor , abbott , & klein 1975 ) . therefore , since there is a well defined stellar mass - luminosity relation , the profiles in the integrated light of a starburst depend on the imf , star formation history , and age of the stellar clusters ( leitherer , robert , & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the profile shapes of the main wind lines such as nv , siiv , and civ can be used to constrain the properties of the starburst .",
    "we compare the observed uv spectra ( wind and photospheric lines , and uv continuum flux ) to the predictions from evolutionary stellar population models .",
    "we use the code starburst99 ( hereafter sb99 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) which is optimized to reproduce many properties of active star forming galaxies .",
    "the stellar population is parameterized in terms of an imf which follows a power - law between two mass limits @xmath4  and @xmath26 .",
    "the stellar population is evolved from the zero - age main sequence using the zero - rotation stellar tracks of the geneva group ( meynet et al .",
    "the sb99 models use two extreme star formation histories , an instantaneous burst and constant star formation ( csf ) .",
    "the code can use two stellar libraries in this spectral region , depending on the metallicity .",
    "one of these libraries is built with iue spectra of milky way stars in the solar vicinity with solar or slightly subsolar metallicity .",

    "we can use the relative strength of the siiv p  cygni profile with respect to the p  cygni profiles of civ and nv in order to constrain the star - formation history of the youngest stellar population .",
    "siiv has a strong profile only in o supergiants , while civ and nv are strong in o stars of any luminosity class .",

    "( 2000 ) , which is an empirical attenuation curve derived for starbursts , we estimate @xmath32 to match the observed spectra with the uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) predicted by the models . because the galactic foreground extinction is very small , @xmath33 ,",

    "there is no significant change of the reddening in the center of ngc  3049 , as suggested by the same value for the different uv spectra extracted ( _ a , b , c _ , and _ d _ ) .    after correcting for reddening and assuming a distance of 18  mpc ( vacca & conti 1992 ) , the uv luminosity at 1500    is @xmath34= 39.52 ( erg  s@xmath7  @xmath7 ) and 39.35 ( erg  s@xmath7",

    "probably , this post - starburst stellar population is more spatially extended than the ionizing stars , therefore , it does not contribute significantly to the continuum flux detected in the stis narrow slit .    the contribution from an additional stellar population to the young burst is not the explanation of the large discrepancy between the stis observed ew(h@xmath10 ) and the value predicted by the 3    4  myr instantaneous burst models . however , the difference can be explained if the ionized gas is more extended than the continuum flux . if the total h@xmath10 flux measured from the ground - based observations ( scale of @xmath0100  pc ) is divided by the optical continuum flux near h@xmath10 measured in the spectrum _",
    "( scale of a few pc ) , the ew(h@xmath10 ) is 120   , which is in perfect agreement with the predicted values for a 3.5  myr instantaneous burst .",
    "there is no need for an extended burst or an older stellar population in the central 0.5@xmath80.1  arcsec .",
    "it is well known that starbursts display a spectral dichotomy .",
    "as we have described , the uv wavelengths are dominated by wind and photospheric absorption lines from massive stars , and the optical wavelengths by nebular emission lines . because the stellar winds of non - wr stars are optically thin to the ionizing photons from massive stars , the photons escape and",
    "are absorbed by the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "then , the ionized gas cools down via radiation from the emission lines .",
    "thus , like the stellar uv lines , the emission lines depend on the stellar content of the starburst . however , it is more difficult to constrain the age , imf , and star - formation history of the starburst through the nebular lines because the modeling of the emission lines is a degenerate problem .",
    "in addition to the radiation field , the strength of these lines depends on the chemical composition , the density structure , and the geometry of the ionized gas .",

    "although these conclusions are based on the hypothesis that the region is ionization bounded , the result about the inconsistency between uv wind lines and nebular lines does not depend on this hypothesis . assuming a density bounded hii region",
    "does not resolve this inconsistency .",
    "it is not certain a priori that there is sufficient nebular matter surrounding the stellar cluster to absorb all the ionizing photons in hii regions .",
    "evidence that some hii regions may be density bounded has been reported previously ( e.g. , beckman et al . 2000 ; relao & peimbert 2002 ; castellanos , daz & tenorio - tagle 2002 ) .",
    "however , we note that the h@xmath10 luminosity obtained under the assumption that all the lyman photons are absorbed by the nebular gas is compatible with the observed value in ngc  3049 .",
    "leaving some room for uncertainties , one can predict the verdict from density bounded models . in order to reproduce the observed size of the hii region , density bounded models",
    "should have a slightly different density and filling factor than taken for the ionization bounded models .",
    "whatever assumption is made for the density bounded models ( for example , one could construct them to reproduce the observed [ oiii]/[oii ] ratio ) , their hei / h@xmath10 ratio will be equal to or larger than predicted by ionization bounded models . therefore ,",
    "our conclusions about the inconsistency between uv wind lines and nebular lines are robust in this respect .",
    "high - metallicity hii regions are regions where a significant amount of dust can exist .",
    "because the electron temperature is low , dust easily produces important changes to the thermal structure of the hii region , and therefore to the emergent optical emission - line spectrum . in this section",
    ", we investigate if dusty models are able to fit the observed emission - line ratios in ngc  3049 .",
    "dust can modify the hii thermal structure in several ways : 1 ) the metals in the gas phase can be depleted onto grains . this depletion tends to increase the electron temperature of the ionized region .",
    "2 ) grains can selectively absorb a fraction of the ionizing photons ; in this way they modify the radiation field seen by the gas .",
    "3 ) grains can provide photoelectric heating of the gas ; subsequently the gas can cool down by electron capture .",
    "the consequences of dust in metal - rich hii regions have been discussed by shields & kennicutt ( 1995 ) .",
    "they found that depletion of the gas - phase abundances introduces the strongest perturbation on the optical spectrum , and grain heating can be particularly important for enhancing the high - ionization lines .    because dust can also modify @xmath40(he)/@xmath40(h ) , we have computed models using the sed from sb99 for instantaneous burst models with a salpeter imf and @xmath4  =  100  m@xmath2 and assuming : i ) only depletion of the gas - phase abundance and ii ) absorption and heating by grains . for an age of 3",
    "  4  myr , the predicted hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 is @xmath6610% lower than the ratio predicted by dust - free models , but the collisional emission ratios are higher .",
    "thus , dust can not reconcile the observed and the predicted emission - line ratios ( figure  15 ) .      our previous analysis suggests the failure of the seds to predict the extreme uv radiation field which is required to reproduce the observed emission lines .",
    "sb99 is optimized for young star forming regions and has been successfully used for consistent models at subsolar metallicity .",
    "therefore it seems likely that the predicted sed in the wr phase is too hard in high - metallicity clusters .",
    "we have computed additional solar metallicity dust - free instantaneous burst models with i ) kurucz atmospheres in _ all _ phases and ii ) costar atmospheres for o and schmutz atmospheres for wr stars .",
    "this allows us to check if the problem is related to the pure - he wr stellar atmosphere models .    at solar metallicity , models using costar",
    "predicts roughly the same hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 as sb99 .",
    "the high - excitation lines are also similar to sb99 for the wolf - rayet phase , but costar predicts larger ratios at younger age due to the inclusion of the wind blanketing in the atmospheres of the main - sequence stars . the agreement at 3  ",
    "5  myr is not surprising because costar and sb99 both use the schmutz unblanketed wr atmosphere .",
    "thus , costar models also fail to reproduce the observed emission - line ratios in ngc  3049 ( figure  16 ) . however , sb99 with kurucz models predict emission  line ratios that are similar to the prediction of the standard sb99 models with @xmath4  =  40  m@xmath2 ( figure  16 ) . although these models fit the collisional lines , they underpredict the hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 if the cluster is 3  ",
    "4  myr old .",
    "this suggests that the static kurucz atmospheres are equally inadequate for modeling the wr fluxes .",
    "this is well known since the pioneering work of hillier ( 1987 ) .",
    "we conclude that pure - he atmosphere models are not adequate for predicting hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 and the high - excitation emission - line ratios in high - metallicity hii regions .",
    "the new generation of wr atmospheres with line - blanketing calculated by smith , norris , & crowther ( 2002 ) can potentially solve this problem .",
    "these atmospheres include the most important metals and have a different density and temperature structure in comparison with the schmutz models . when coupled with starburst99 , the models of smith et al .",
    "give a softer far - uv radiation field at high metallicity .",
    "this is the result of the combination of three effects : i ) inclusion of blanketing suppresses the far - uv flux ; ii ) a higher wind density leads to recombination shortward of 228   ; iii ) the wr core temperature of the evolutionary tracks was found to be too high to be compatible with the new atmospheres .",
    "smith et al find that effect i ) is more important for late wr stars , whereas effect ii ) dominates for early wr stars .",
    "the third effect is the result of different temperature definitions in the evolution and atmosphere models .",
    "it can only be calibrated empirically , e.g. , by comparing the emergent radiation field to observations .",
    "smith et al .",
    "performed an initial calibration and provide a recipe for the adjustment of the evolutionary temperatures .",
    "the new models must produce less ionizing radiation at frequencies above the heii ionizing limit than the schmutz atmospheres in order not to overpredict the high - excitation ratios . on the other hand",
    ", their @xmath67/@xmath68 must be high enough in order not to underestimate hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 as the kurucz atmospheres do . a new version of sb99 including the new set of the stellar atmospheres prepared by smith et al .",
    "was released on 2002 july 23 .",
    "seds obtained with these blanketed wr and o stellar atmospheres at solar and two solar metallicities have been applied to ngc  3049 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 17 .",
    "as it was expected , the models predict lower hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 and lower high - excitation collisional lines than the schmutz et al .",
    "unblanketed wr atmospheres and are closer to the observed values .",
    "this comparison of the models with ngc  3049 largely supports the view that the softening of the far - uv radiation field at high metallicity is not only a consequence of the inclusion the line - blanketing effect but also of the coupling between the wr temperature of the evolutionary tracks and the new atmospheres .",
    "future tests on high metallicity hii regions will have to confirm and refine the calibration between these two different temperatures proposed by smith et al .",
    "we have obtained hst ultraviolet and optical stis spectroscopic and imaging observations of the metal - rich starburst ngc  3049 .",
    "these data are interpreted using evolutionary synthesis models optimized for star forming regions , which allow us to constrain the stellar content of the nuclear starburst . from the analysis of the uv - optical continuum and the optical emission lines we have obtained the following results :    * the nuclear starburst in ngc  3049 is very compact .",
    "the uv - optical continuum is dominated by a central cluster that is unresolved in the uv and optical stis images .",
    "the fwhm of the spatial profiles is only @xmath00.1  arcsec , corresponding to 9  pc for a distance of 18 mpc .",
    "* the central uv flux shows strong wind ( civ , siiv , nv ) and photospheric lines ( ov @xmath31371 , fev @xmath31360 - 1380 , siiii @xmath31417 , ciii @xmath31427 , and sv @xmath31501 ) .",
    "these lines suggest a powerful starburst .",
    "the modeling of the continuum and stellar absorption lines indicates that a high - metallicity ( @xmath69 ) 3    4  myr old instantaneous burst with a salpeter imf and @xmath4  =  100  m@xmath2 fits the central 0.5  arcsec spectrum observed in the uv .",
    "the mass estimated for the cluster is @xmath010@xmath1  m@xmath2 , if the extinction toward the cluster is @xmath32 .",
    "the reddening - corrected luminosity of this cluster accounts for almost half of the far - ir luminosity of ngc  3049 .",
    "the massive stars in this cluster provide enough photons ( @xmath70 ( ph  s@xmath7 ) ) to explain the observed nuclear h@xmath11 luminosity .",
    "models with very few massive stars ( e.g. , with @xmath4  @xmath71  m@xmath2 ) are not able to fit the uv stellar lines .",
    "the analysis of the central 1.2  arcsec uv flux also indicates that there is no significant change of the extinction and a very small age spread . * the central 0.3  arcsec in the optical shows wr features at 4660   .",
    "these observations confirm previous results ( schaerer et al 1999 ; guseva et al 2000 ) that late wn and early and late wc stars are the dominant wr stellar population .",
    "the total luminosity of the bump is @xmath72  erg  s@xmath7 if the stellar reddening is @xmath32 , and the ew of the bump is 14   .",
    "this luminosity is provided by @xmath0275 wr stars .",
    "a wr / o ratio equal to 0.065 is estimated for the cluster .",
    "this ratio and the ew of the bump is in very good agreement with the predictions of the evolutionary models for a 3    4  myr old high - metallicity starburst .",
    "therefore the number of wr stars is correctly predicted by the stellar evolution models .",
    "* we have not detected any absorption lines that could indicate the presence of red supergiants , or an intermediate or old stellar population .",
    "the blue optical continuum of the central 0.5@xmath80.1  arcsec is well fitted by a 3  myr old instantaneous burst with @xmath32 , as predicted by the uv continuum .",
    "thus , no additional older stellar population contributes significantly to the nuclear optical continuum . *",
    "the ew of the h@xmath10 lines is only 7   .",
    "this is lower than the values of 200    60    predicted by a 3    4  myr instantaneous burst model .",
    "however , this discrepancy is naturally explained if the ionized gas is more extended than the compact cluster . *",
    "two kinematic components are resolved in the h@xmath11 emission line .",
    "these two components are extended by @xmath030  pc south - west of the maximum of the continuum , and by @xmath08  pc at @xmath050  pc north - east .",
    "the second component is blueshifted @xmath060  km  s@xmath7  with respect to brightest main component .",
    "it may represent a bubble powered by the winds from massive stars .",
    "additional evidence for an outflow of the interstellar medium comes from the blueshift of 200  km  s@xmath7  of the uv interstellar lines with respect to the radial velocity reported by ned of 300  km  s@xmath7   with respect to the nebular optical radial velocity . * the modeling of the nebular emission lines failed to constrain the hot stellar content of the nuclear starburst of ngc  3049 .",
    "the models which predict emission - line ratios in agreement with the observations contain very few massive stars .",
    "this result , which is clearly in contradiction with the uv spectrum , would be in line with previous suggestions for a depletion of massive stars in the imf of metal - rich starbursts . however , this conclusion is an artifact of the failure of the population synthesis models to predict the ionizing radiation field .",
    "most likely , the overly hard radiation field results from the failure of the currently available wr atmosphere grid .",
    "the new model set of smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) includes blanketing and uses different temperature and density structures .",
    "these models applied to ngc  3049 predict a softer far - uv radiation field and provide a better match to the data .",
    "+ the costar and sb99 models predict hei @xmath35876/h@xmath10 and [ oiii]/[oii ] ratios that are higher than observed if the ionizing radiation is provided by a 3    4  myr old cluster formed with a salpeter imf and @xmath4  =  100  m@xmath2 .",
    "seds using only the kurucz atmospheres can adequately predict the collisional line ratios but they underpredict @xmath40(he)/@xmath40(h ) .",

    "<S> equally important goal is to perform a consistency test of the latest generation of starburst models in such a high - metallicity environment . </S>",

    "<S> the strong , blueshifted stellar lines of civ and siiv detected in the uv spectra indicate a metal - rich , compact , massive ( @xmath010@xmath1  m@xmath2 ) cluster of age 3    4  myr emitting the uv - optical continuum . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong evidence against a depletion of massive stars in this metal - rich cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the derived age and the upper mass - limit cut - off of the initial mass function are also consistent with the detection of wolf - rayet ( wr ) features at optical wavelengths . as a second independent constraint on the massive stellar content , the nebular emission - line spectrum is modeled with photoionization codes using stellar spectra from evolutionary synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the nuclear starburst of ngc  3049 from the stis images indicates a simple geometry for the nebular emission - line region . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nebular lines are badly reproduced by 3    4  myr instantaneous bursts , as required by the uv line spectrum , when unblanketed wr and/or kurucz stellar atmospheres are used . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding number of photons above 24 and 54  ev in the synthetic models is too high in comparison with values suggested by the observed line ratios . since the ionizing spectrum in this regime </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by emission from wr stars , this discrepancy between observations and models is most likely the result of incorrect assumptions about the wr stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the nebular spectrum of high - metallicity starbursts is poorly reproduced by models for wr dominated populations . however , the new model set of smith et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) with blanketed wr and o atmospheres and adjusted wr temperatures predicts a softer far - uv radiation field , providing a better match to the data . </S>"
