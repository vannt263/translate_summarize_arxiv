    "the value estimated for the inverse susceptibility exponent @xmath85 along with the absence of spontaneous magnetization observed through arrott plots testify the inhomogeneous nature of magnetism in this material and confirm the griffiths phase - like features .",
    "the observed features arise from the site disorder at the @xmath19 site supplemented by the lattice distortions brought about by the smaller radius of tb .",
    "no mode softening of phonon frequencies is observed in tb@xmath0nimno@xmath1 which is qualitatively different from the observation in other double perovskites with a non - magnetic rare earth .",
    "thus , we conclude that the magnetic and lattice properties of @xmath7o@xmath1 where @xmath8 is a magnetic rare earth are different from those of the non - magnetic counterparts .",
