    "most of the early theoretical work on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) was focused , after rees pioneering work [ 1 ] , on anisotropic cosmological models [ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ] .",
    "the degree of faraday rotation expected in the presence of an universal magnetic field and the use of polarization measurements to constraint the amplitude of such field were also considered [ 14,33 ] .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that even in isotropic cosmological models the anisotropic component of the cmb is polarized [ 10 ] .",
    "detailed numerical predictions have been made for dark matter dominated models with adiabatic fluctuations [ see e.g. 11,12,13 ] , with and without an early reionization of the intergalactic medium [ 15].these calculations have shown that the level of polarization can be @xmath3 percent of the anisotropy signal .",
    "after the cobe / dmr result [ 16 ] , new attention has been dedicated to the tensor modes of metric fluctuations , which also produces anisotropy on large angular scales [ 17,18,19,20,21,22,23 ] .",
    "the polarization due to a background of primordial gravitational waves has been widely discussed [ 24,25,26,27,28 ] . for describing the statistic of the polarization field was also introduced the polarization - anisotropy correlation function [ 29,30 ] , while other authors [ 31,32 ] have shown that neglecting polarization yields a theoretical overestimate of the anisotropy at small angular scale .    from the experimental side , in spite of a continuous increment in the experimental sensitivity , no polarization was found and only upper limits were given [ 34,35,36,37 ] , with the best upper limit to date of @xmath4 from the saskatoon experiment [ 38 ] . as we show in section 5 , the level of cmb polarization expected is in most of the models at least a factor @xmath5 below this limit , so is not clear if the present sensitivity of the cmb experiments is sufficient to detect polarization .",
    "however , in view of forthcoming high sensitivity new experiments , it is of interest to discuss the general properties of the polarization pattern and its dependence to the various cosmological parameters .",
    "so , the aim of this work is to review the basics steps behind the theoretical calculation of cmb polarization .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "@xmath6 we briefly review the definition of the stokes parameters and their variations in a thomson scattering . in section @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "we write the set of equations necessary to describe anisotropy and polarization of the cmb . in section",
    "@xmath9 we review some of the results obtained by numerically integrate those equations . finally , in section @xmath10 , we summarize the main findings .",
    "for an elliptically polarized wave , the components of the electric field along two orthogonal directions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 say , can be written as :    i    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "the polarization of the radiation field is conveniently described in terms of the stokes parameters :    i    the parameter @xmath15 is proportional to the intensity of the wave ( we omit the proportionality factor ) @xmath16 measures the ratio of the principal axes of the polarization ellipse while @xmath17 or @xmath18 measures the orientation of the ellipse relative to the @xmath11 axes . in general @xmath19 , the equality holding for an elliptically polarized wave .",
    "a clockwise rotation by an angle @xmath20 of the @xmath21 axes in the polarization plane leaves unchanged the @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameters and it is equivalent to apply the operator :    i * * ( ) =    to the vector @xmath22 .",
    "in the thomson scattering , the light scattered in a direction making an angle @xmath23 with the direction of incidence ( see figure 1 ) is    i    in analogy with the equation ( @xmath6 ) the stokes parameters of the scattered light are : i    or , in matrix form , @xmath24 , where    i= 3 2    in order to study the variations of stokes parameters in the lab frame ( see figure 2 ) we have to :    1 .",
    "apply the transformation @xmath25 to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angle between the meridian and the scattering planes . in this way",
    "we obtain the stokes parameters of the incident light in the frame of figure 1 . 2 .",
    "apply @xmath28 to these parameters in order to obtain the stokes parameters of the scattered light , again in the frame of figure 1 .",
    "apply the transformation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 represents the angle between the plane @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this way we are back to the lab frame .",
    "thus , the radiation scattered in the @xmath33 direction , relative to the lab frame , can be written as [ 39 ] :    ii^s ( , ) = 14 _ 4 [ ( , ; ,)(,)]d     where    i =    i= ,    ip^0 = 34 ,    ip^1= 34 ,    ip^2= 34 ,    and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "in order to study anisotropy and polarization of the cmb we need to write down the transfer equation for the stokes parameters . we restrict ourselves to isotropic universes where , to zero - th order , anisotropy and polarization vanish .",
    "the perturbations to the stokes parameters and to the other relevant quantities ( see section 3.3 ) are written in the synchronous gauge formalism . following peebles [ 40,41 ] we introduce the fractional fluctuations of the stokes parameters as follows :    i= _ ( t )    where ( @xmath38,@xmath39,@xmath40,@xmath41 ) are functions of the observer position @xmath42 , of the line of sight observation @xmath43 and of the cosmic time @xmath44 . to first order the transfer equations",
    "becomes    i + _ a + = _ t n_e    where @xmath45 is the term containing the linear perturbation to the metric tensor , ( @xmath46,@xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49 ) are evaluated in the comoving frame and refer to the radiation scattered in the @xmath50 direction , and @xmath51 is the scale factor . in order to avoid spatial dependence",
    "it is convenient to work in fourier space .",
    "we choose for each @xmath52 mode a reference system with the @xmath53 axis parallel to @xmath54 , in order to achieve an azimuthal symmetry .      for scalar modes ,",
    "the only non vanishing components of the perturbed metric tensor are the diagonal ones : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 because of the chosen gauge ) .",
    "thus , the gravitational term in equation ( 14 ) has the form : @xmath59 , and each fourier mode is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath60 .",
    "after integrating over this angle equation ( 7 ) it can be proved that @xmath61 and @xmath62 give no contribution .",
    "therefore we can assume @xmath63 in this case .",
    "also the equation for @xmath16 is decoupled from the others : if @xmath16 vanishes at the beginning , it also vanishes afterwards .",
    "therefore only the perturbations @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the @xmath15 and @xmath17 parameters are of interest .",
    "their evolution is described by the following transfer equation [ 10,11,12,13 ] :    i + i k a - = _",
    "t n_e ( _ -1 ^ 1 ( ,  ) d - )    where @xmath64 is the term taking into account the effects of gravitational potential , and where the @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 is composed by the first two rows and columns of the matrix @xmath67 in the @xmath68 basis :    i(, ) = 316    the angular dependence in equation ( 15 ) can be eliminated by expanding @xmath38 and @xmath39 in legendre polynomials :    i= _ ( ^k_2 ( t ) p_2 ( ) + i ^k_2 + 1 ( t ) p_2 + 1 ( ) )    iq= _",
    "( ^k_2 ( t ) p_2 ( ) + i ^k_2 + 1 ( t ) p_2 + 1 ( ) )    because of the orthogonality of the legendre polynomials , equation ( 15 ) becomes :    i    these equations are coupled together through the quadrupole term , _",
    "i.e. _ the radiation must have a quadrupole anisotropy to get polarized .      for tensor perturbations the only non vanishing components of the perturbed metric tensor are @xmath69 and @xmath70 where the two values @xmath71 , @xmath72 refer to the two polarization states of the gravitational waves .",
    "the equation of transfer has the following form [ 24 ] :    it + i k a - = _",
    "t n_e ( _ ( , ; , ) - )    where now @xmath73 , and the @xmath74 matrix @xmath75 is composed by the first three rows and columns of the matrix @xmath62 in the @xmath68 basis :    i = 38    with @xmath76 , @xmath77",
    ". the particular form of the metric tensor makes @xmath38 still dependent on @xmath60 in spite of the choice of a special reference system .",
    "however , this dependence is not too cumbersome .",
    "in fact , it is possible to introduce a change of variables [ 24 ] to eliminate the dependence on the azimuthal angle .",
    "the new quantities , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are related to the old ones by the following relation :    i    it is easy to prove that , with these new variables , only @xmath62 provides a non vanishing contribution to the integral of equation ( 7 ) over @xmath60 .",
    "this is why we have considered only this term in equation ( 21 ) .",
    "also , as the boltzmann equation becomes independent of @xmath60 , we can still develop fluctuations of @xmath78,@xmath79 and @xmath80 in legendre polynomials .",
    "thus , equation ( 20 ) becomes :    i    where    i= 3/5 _ , 0 + 6/35 _ , 2 + 1/210 _ , 4 - 1/10 _ , 0 + 1/35 _",
    ", 2- 1/210_,a    and @xmath81 identifies either the @xmath82 or the @xmath83 polarization state of the gravitational wave .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a universe composed by baryons , cold dark matter , photons and three families of massless neutrinos .",
    "the equations describing anisotropy and polarization of the cmb have been written above . in fourier space ,",
    "the equations describing fractional fluctuations in the remaining cosmic components are [ 42,43,44 ] :    i_t+ ika_= y",

    "eq.(25 ) describes the fluctuations in the massless neutrinos .",
    "we follow this component only when the perturbation proper wavelength is larger than one tenth of the horizon . afterwards , free streaming rapidly damps fluctuations in this hot component .",
    "the time evolution of the baryon and cdm density contrasts and of the baryon peculiar velocity are described by eq.(28 ) , ( 30 ) and ( 29 ) respectively .",
    "the system for the scalar fluctuations is closed by eq.(26 ) and ( 27 ) describing the field equations for the trace and the @xmath84 component of the metric perturbation tensor , while eq.(31 ) is all we need to describe the evolution of the metric perturbations for tensor fluctuations .",
    "we numerically integrate the previous equations from redshift @xmath85 up to the present .",
    "the abundance of free electrons , @xmath86 , is evaluated following a standard recombination scheme [ 45,46 ] for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , taken in the ratio @xmath89 . in the following",
    "we also consider the possibility that the universe reionized instantaneously at redshift @xmath90 , and remained completely reionized up to the present .",
    "under the assumption of gaussian initial conditions , the statistical properties of the cmb anisotropy and polarization patterns are fully described in terms of their correlation functions .",
    "the stochastic anisotropic component of the cmb is conveniently expanded in spherical harmonics : @xmath91 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath92 are random gaussian variables with zero mean and rotationally invariant variances , @xmath93 .",

    "we have to fix : i ) the total density parameter , @xmath114 , and the cosmological constant , @xmath115 ; ii ) the baryonic abundance , @xmath116 ; iii ) the hubble constant ; iv ) the primordial spectral index for spectral fluctuations ; v ) the relative amplitude of scalar and tensor fluctuations ; vi ) the spectral index for tensor fluctuations ; vii ) the thermal history of the universe ; viii ) the overall amplitude for scalar fluctuations .",
    "the baryonic abundance is quite severly restricted by primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "we consider the fiducial value of @xmath117 as representative of the possible uncertainty in this parameter .",
    "we remind that changes in @xmath116 yield variations in the pressure of the photon - baryon fluid before recombination , and then variations in the amplitude of the first acoustic peak in the anisotropy power spectrum .    for flat models the value of the hubble constant is usually taken to be @xmath118 for age considerations , even if the estimated globular cluster age allows for slightly different values : @xmath119 [ 63 ] .",
    "small variations in the hubble constant yield huge variations in the radiation power spectrum , modifying both the amplitudes and positions of the acoustic peaks .    the primordial index for scalar fluctuations , @xmath120 , is usually taken to be unity , as inflation suggests",
    "however , in more general inflationary scenarios , @xmath120 can be either smaller or larger than unity [ 64 ] .",
    "this modifies the relative power between the anisotropy on small and large angular scale .",
    "power - law inflationary models predict @xmath121 , but also a background of gravitational waves .",
    "a standard prediction is that the ratio of the quadrupoles induced by scalar and tensor fluctuations is :    ic_2 c_2 = -7n_t ~7(1-n_s ) ,    which allows to relate amplitudes and shapes of primordial power spectra for scalar and tensor fluctuations , respectively [ 18,49,64 ] .",
    "the thermal history of the universe , in its standard form , assumes recombination of the primordial plasma at redshift @xmath122 .",
    "however , both the gunn - peterson test [ 65 ] and the enriched composition of the intracluster medium [ 74,75 ] suggest the possibility of a considerable energy release during the early stages of galaxy formation and evolution .    finally , the amplitude of fluctuations it is still unknown from first principles , and it is fixed in order to match the observed rms temperature fluctuations ( @xmath123 ) of the cobe / dmr anisotropy maps [ 53 ] .    in figure 4 we show theoretical predictions for cmb anisotropy and polarization of a standard cold dark matter model with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and standard recombination .",
    "the anisotropy power spectrum for scalar fluctuations has a flat behavior at low @xmath128 s , where the sachs - wolfe effect [ 66 ] dominates , and a structure of peaks at higher @xmath128 s , defined by the acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid experienced before recombination by fluctuations smaller then the acoustic horizon .",
    "the damping at high @xmath128 s is due to the finite thickness of the last - scattering surface [ 67 ] .",
    "the first peak at @xmath129 corresponds to fluctuations that entered the horizon at recombination , which subtends an angle @xmath130 .",
    "the polarization power spectrum has instead power only at @xmath131 , _",
    "i.e. _ on scales @xmath132 .",
    "the case of pure tensor fluctuations is show in figure 4 only for the didactic purposes . in this case",
    ", the anisotropy spectrum has power only at @xmath133 and the polarization spectrum shows a prominent peak at @xmath134 .",
    "note that the polarization spectrum has an amplitude lower than the anisotropy spectrum by a factor @xmath135 and @xmath136 for scalar and tensor fluctuations , respectively .",
    "real experiments are sensitive to a limited region of the power spectrum , because of the antenna beam and modulation techniques . for anisotropy experiments",
    ", this effect can be parameterized by a window function , @xmath137 , so that the variance of temperature fluctuations detected by an experiment can be written as :    i^2 = 14 _ ( 2 + 1 ) c_w _    a similar expression holds for the variance of the fluctuations of the @xmath17 parameter :    i^2 = 14 _ ( 2 + 1 ) c_^q w _    in fact , it can be proved that the azimuthal contribution [ see equations ( 54 ) and ( 57 ) ] to the @xmath17 variance vanishes . in equation ( 67 ) we use the same anisotropy window functions , in order to give an order of magnitude estimate of the level of measurable polarization at different angular scales .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the expected rms values for cmb anisotropy and polarization using 15 different window functions corresponding to 9 different anisotropy experiments .",
    "the level of polarization from scalar modes is below the current experimental sensitivity , even for small scale experiments such has saskatoon or cat that are sensitives to multipole @xmath138 where the polarization has the first two peaks .",
    "the rms level from pure tensor modes , even for the max experiment that seems to have the best window function , is below 0.5 @xmath139 , so the separation between scalar and tensor fluctuations do not seems to be at hand with polarization measurements [ 25,26,27,28,73 ] .",
    "this can be done by combining anisotropy measurements at both large ( where tensor modes could contribute ) and small ( where tensor modes do not contribute ) angular scales [ 49,72,73 ] .",
    "an accurate mapping of the anisotropy pattern with both high sensitivity and high angular resolution will be provided by planned , dedicated space missions such as cobras / samba [ 68 ] and map [ 52 ] . at the moment the bulk of degree - scale detections , combined with the cobe / dmr and tenerife experiments , seems to suggest a spectral index for scalar fluctuations @xmath140 [ 69 ] and a negligible contribution of tensor modes .",
    "as mentioned above , there are several free parameters , each with its own uncertainty , which define a theoretical model .",
    "so , it is interesting to explore the sensitivity of the polarization level relative to the anisotropy one . to show this , we plot in figure 6 the quantity @xmath141 as a function of @xmath128 , for different choices of the model parameters .",
    "generally speaking the effects of the variation of these parameters on anisotropy and polarization are similar : both quantities tend to decrease with increasing @xmath142 and tend to increase when a cosmological constant @xmath143 is taken into account .",
    "in particular , varying @xmath120 or @xmath116 yields basically no variations on the @xmath141 ratio . moreover , decreasing the spectral index and adding gravitational waves increase the large scale polarization , but , as we have shown , not enough to pass the threshold of present day detector sensitivity",
    "so , even taking into account reasonable uncertainties in the parameters , its seems that only with an huge increment in the experimental sensitivity ( see the accompanying paper by f. melchiorri et al . in this volume ) and/or a space mission [ 52,70,71 ] a robust detection of the polarization spectrum over a wide range of @xmath128 s would be possible .",
    "coulson et al . [ 29 ] suggested searching a correlation between the temperature in one direction and the polarization in a circle at distance @xmath23 from that direction .",
    "the shape of the correlation function ( 62 ) measurable in this way is show in figure 7 .",
    "as we can see the cross correlation is positive on scales @xmath144 , negative on scales between @xmath145 and @xmath146 and positive again on scales @xmath147 .",
    "according to [ 52 ] the future map satellite would have the capability to measure the expected amplitude of this signal .",
    "the final item to be investigated is the dependence of cmb anisotropy and polarization on the thermal history of the universe .",
    "a reionization at @xmath148 produces a new , later and thicker last scattering surface .",
    "the effect of such a new last scattering surface is to smooth the anisotropy on small angular scales and to leave unchanged the level of anisotropy on large angular scales .",
    "the effect of reionization on polarization is to reduce the polarization on small scales but to increase the polarization level at large angular scales .",
    "this is shown again in figure 6 .",
    "thus , possible detection of polarization between @xmath149 and @xmath150 , say , would be an evidence for an early re - heating of the intergalactic medium .",
    "numerical solutions of the boltzmann transport equation show that a certain degree of polarization must be present as a consequence of the primordial fluctuations responsible for the structure formation .",
    "the level of polarization depends strongly on the angular scale , much more than in the case of anisotropy , quite independently of the choice of the model parameters . at angular scales larger than one degree",
    "we do not expect detectable polarization unless the universe was reionized at early times @xmath151 . at small angular scales",
    "the polarization may reach the @xmath152 of the anisotropy .",
    "however , a polarization of a few percent at angular scales of @xmath153-@xmath150 could be explained only because reionization : a search for polarization at these scale is therefore important in the study of the thermal history of the universe .",
    "also , it seems hard to disentangle tensor from scalar perturbations through measurements of polarization , due to the tenuity of the signal .",
