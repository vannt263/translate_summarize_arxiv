    "voigt wave propagation ( vwp ) is an example of a singular form of optical propagation . in the nonsingular case of optical propagation in a linear , homogeneous , anisotropic , dielectric material , two independent plane waves , with orthogonal polarizations and different phase speeds , generally propagate in a given direction bw .",
    "however , in certain dissipative biaxial dielectric materials , for example , there exist particular directions along which these two waves coalesce to form a single plane wave , namely a voigt wave khap , voigt , panch , fedorov , agranovich , grech .",
    "most conspicuously , the amplitude of this voigt wave varies linearly with propagation direction .",
    "more complex materials , such as bianisotropic materials , offer greater scope for vwp lakh_helicoidal_bianisotropic_98,berry , but we restrict our attention here to the relatively simple case involving biaxial dielectric materials .",
    "while vwp constitutes a fundamental phenomenon in the optics of anisotropic ( and bianisotropic ) materials , these waves have yet to be exploited in technological applications .",
    "however , recent advances relating to engineered composite materials may lead to vwp being more readily harnessed for technological applications .",
    "for example , homogenized composite materials ( hcms ) may be conceptualized which support vwp , with these hcms being derived from relatively commonplace component materials which do not themselves support vwp ml03,ml_wrm . furthermore , by judicious design of the homogenization process , the directions in the hcm which support vwp may be controlled m2011_jopa .",
    "the present study is motivated by the prospect harnessing vwp for optical sensing applications .",
    "specifically , a porous biaxial dielectric material is considered ; and we investigate how the directions which support vwp vary as the porous material is infiltrated by a material of refractive index @xmath0 .",
    "the infiltrated porous material is regarded as an hcm .",
    "an extended version of the bruggeman homogenization formalism is used to estimate the hcm s constitutive parameters m_jnp .",
    "this formalism accommodates particulate component materials where the component particles may have different shapes , orientations and sizes , and it is not restricted to small volume fractions of the infiltrating material .    in our notation , bold typeface denotes a vector , with the @xmath2 symbol signifying a unit vector .",
    "thus , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the unit cartesian vectors .",
    "double underlining with normal typeface denotes a 3@xmath63 dyadic ; and @xmath7 is the identity 3@xmath63 dyadic .",
    "the superscript @xmath8 denotes the dyadic transpose ; and the dyadic operator ` @xmath9 ' yields the determinant .",
    "double underlining with blackboard bold typeface denotes a 6@xmath66 dyadic .",
    "the symbols @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the permittivity and permeability of free space , respectively , while the free - space wavenumber is given as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the angular frequency .",
    "let us consider an hcm arising from two component materials , labelled @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that component material @xmath14 is an isotropic dielectric material with permittivity dyadic @xmath16 , where the relative permittivity @xmath17 .",
    "component material @xmath15 is taken to be an orthorhombic dielectric material characterized by the diagonal permittivity dyadic ab @xmath18 the volume fraction of material @xmath14 is @xmath19 and that of material @xmath15 is @xmath20 ; and @xmath21 .",
    "the two component materials are randomly - distributed as assemblies of generally ellipsoidal particles .",
    "we assume that all material @xmath14 particles have the same orientation and all material @xmath15 particles have the same orientation ; in general these two orientations are not the same .",
    "however , for simplicity , let both material @xmath14 and material @xmath15 particles have the same shape .",
    "the vector @xmath22 prescribes the surfaces of the component particles , relative to their centres . in eq .  , @xmath23 is the radial vector which prescribes the surface of the unit sphere .",
    "the surface of the unit sphere is mapped onto the surface of an ellipsoid by the real - symmetric surface dyadic @xmath24 , while @xmath25 provides a linear measure of the ellipsoidal particle size . in order to be consistent with the notion of homogenization",
    ", it essential that @xmath26 is much smaller than the wavelengths involved .",
    "however , we implement an extended version of the bruggeman formalism for which @xmath26 is not required to be vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath27 ; accordingly , in the following we write @xmath28 instead of @xmath26 @xmath29 .",
    "we choose the orientation of our coordinate system such that the semi - major axes of the material @xmath15 particles are aligned with the coordinate axes .",
    "relative to the material @xmath15 particles , the material @xmath14 particles are rotated in the @xmath30 plane by an angle @xmath31 with respect to the @xmath32 axis .",
    "consequently the surface dyadic for material @xmath15 is given as @xmath33{u_x u_y u_z } } \\le u_x \\hat{\\#x } \\",
    ", \\hat{\\#x } + u_y   \\hat{\\#y } \\ , \\hat{\\#y }",

    "therefore , the resulting hcm is a biaxial dielectric material with a symmetric permittivity dyadic of the form @xcite @xmath36 wherein the off - diagonal element @xmath37 provided that @xmath38 for @xmath39 . an extended version of the bruggeman homogenization formalism @xcite is used to estimate @xmath40 . a description of this formalism is provided in appendix  1 .",
    "next we turn to the prospect of vwp in the hcm , for all possible directions relative to the symmetry axes of the hcm .",
    "it is convenient do so indirectly , by considering vwp along the @xmath41 axis for all possible orientations of the hcm .",
    "accordingly , the hcm permittivity dyadic in the rotated coordinate frame ml03 @xmath42   \\l{hcmrot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is introduced , with the orthogonal rotation dyadic @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 being the three euler angles arfken .",
    "voigt waves propagate along the @xmath41 axis of the biaxial dielectric material described by the permittivity dyadic provided that the following two necessary and sufficient conditions are satisfied gl01 :    * @xmath47 and * @xmath48 ,    where the scalars @xmath49 and @xmath50 significantly , these conditions can not be satisfied by isotropic or uniaxial dielectric materials .",
    "let us now investigate numerically the sensitivity of the directions which support vwp to changes in the refractive index @xmath0 of the material which infiltrates the porous host material @xmath15 .",
    "these directions are yielded by the euler angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for which @xmath51 and @xmath48 . before embarking on our numerical studies ,",
    "let us observe that there is no need to consider the angular coordinate @xmath46 in our studies because propagation parallel to the @xmath41 axis ( in the rotated coordinate system ) is independent of rotation about that axis .    in the following we focus on the case where",
    "the component materials @xmath14 and @xmath15 are specified by the constitutive parameters @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being dissipation and anisotropy parameters , respectively .",
    "we consider spheroidal component particles specified by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , in terms of a particle eccentricity parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the relationship between the extended ( and unextended ) bruggeman estimates of the hcm s relative permittivity parameters @xmath58 and the parameters specifying the component materials is a topic which has been explored in earlier works ml03,ml_wrm , m2011_jopa . for convenient reference , in appendix  2 graphs of @xmath58 versus volume fraction @xmath19 , orientation angle @xmath31 , dimensionless size parameter @xmath59 , and eccentricity parameter @xmath57 , are presented for the component materials used in the present study , as specified by eqns .  .",
    "in this subsection we explore numerically the hcm orientations which support vwp as functions of anisotropy parameter @xmath54 , volume fraction @xmath19 , eccentricity parameter @xmath57 , particle orientation angle @xmath31 , dissipation parameter @xmath53 , and dimensionless size parameter @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , the sensitivity of these vwp orientations with respect to small changes in the refractive index of material @xmath14 is considered .    in general , for a given dissipative biaxial material ,",
