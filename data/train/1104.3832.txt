    "one of the main issues in this setting is the behavior of the bilinear map ( v , w ) : = - ( v w ) in the above mentioned sobolev spaces .",

    "to estimate @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the above two inequalities play a major role in the very interesting paper @xcite on approximate euler / ns solutions and _ a posteriori _ estimates on exact solutions .",

    "[ buap ] some features distinguishing our approach from @xcite are the following ones .",
    "\\(i ) differently from ( [ criter ] ) , our control inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) depend explicitly on @xmath20 and thus could allow a more accurate analysis of the influence of viscosity on the regularity of the euler / ns solutions .",
    "\\(ii ) our approach promises better lower bounds on the time of existence of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 and under specific assumptions illustrated in the paper , the inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) have solutions @xmath6 with @xmath52 , implying the global nature of the ns solution @xmath4 ; on the contrary , if @xmath53 or @xmath54 are nonzero the inequality ( [ criter ] ) can not have a solution with very large @xmath45 , since the right hand side is bounded by @xmath55 and thus vanishes for @xmath56 .",
    "\\(iii ) in @xcite there is not an explicit bound on the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such as ( [ buap ] ) ( however , our analysis yielding ( [ buap ] ) is greatly indebted to @xcite and , in a sense , it mainly refines and completes a chain of inequalities for @xmath57 appearing therein ) .",
    "\\(iv ) the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the inequalities ( [ bbasineq ] ) ( [ kkatineq ] ) are not evaluated in @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , here we have at hand our previous results @xcite @xcite on these constants ; thus , in specific applications , we can implement the control inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) and their outcome ( [ buap ] ) in a fully quantitative way .    as an example of our approach , in the final part of the paper we consider the euler / ns equations on @xmath58 with a specific initial datum @xmath42 . independently of the approach developed here , this datum has been already considered in an interesting paper by behr , ne@xmath59as and wu @xcite , where it is indicated as the origin of a possible blow - up for the euler equations . however , in the cited work the blow - up is conjectured on the grounds of a merely `` experimental '' analysis of a finite number of terms in the power series @xmath60 solving formally the euler cauchy problem .    in the present work ,",
    "dealing with the initial datum of @xcite both for @xmath61 and for @xmath51 , a different approach to the cauchy problem is developed using the familiar galerkin approximation ( with a convenient set of fourier modes ) , combined with our general setting for approximate solutions based on the control inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) ; in this case , the sobolev order is @xmath62 , @xmath5 is the galerkin solution and we use for it the required estimators , to be substituted in the control inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) ( with the values for the constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 obtained in @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we search for a solution @xmath65 fulfilling eqs .",
    "( [ ciq ] ) as equalities ( i.e. , with @xmath66 replaced by @xmath67 ) ; this gives rise to an ordinary cauchy problem for @xmath65 , which is solved very easily and reliably by numerical means .",
    "admittedly , our computations are preliminary : they were performed using mathematica on a pc , with a fairly small set of @xmath68 fourier modes for the galerkin approximation ; we plan to develop the same approach with more powerful computational tools in a subsequent work .    in a few words ,",
    "our results are as follows : in the case @xmath61 , the solution @xmath65 of the control equations ( [ ciq ] ) exists on a finite time interval @xmath69 ( after which it blows up ) ; so , we can grant existence for the euler cauchy problem on the interval @xmath69 , where we also have the estimate ( [ buap ] ) on the @xmath70 distance between the exact solution @xmath4 and the galerkin approximate solution @xmath5 .",
    "( unfortunately , @xmath3 is less than the blow - up time suggested in @xcite for the euler cauchy problem , so we can not disprove the conjecture of the cited paper ; the situation could change using many more galerkin modes , which is our aim for the future ) . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the situation is similar : @xmath65 blows up in a finite time @xmath3 , and we can grant existence for the ns cauchy problem only up to @xmath3 . on the contrary , for @xmath72 , our approach grants global existence for the ns cauchy problem ( and a bound of the type ( [ buap ] ) on the full interval @xmath73 ) .    to conclude this introduction ,",
    "let us describe the organization of the paper .",
    "in section [ prel ] we present some preliminaries : these concern mainly the sobolev spaces on @xmath0 , in view of their applications to the euler / ns equations ( [ eul ] ) . in section [ caupro ]",
    "we define formally the euler / ns cauchy problem , the general notion of approximate solution for this problem and the related error estimators . in section [ secmain ] , that contains the main theoretical results of the paper , we develop the general framework yielding the control inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) , and prove the estimate ( [ buap ] ) on the distance between the exact solution @xmath4 of the euler / ns cauchy problem and an approximate solution @xmath5 ( here we also give more details on the connections of the present work with @xcite ) . in section [ analyt ]",
    "we present some analytical solutions of the control inequalities ( [ ciq ] ) , under specific assumptions for their estimators and supposing , for simplicity , that the external forcing in ( [ eul ] ) is zero ; as anticipated , in certain cases our analytical solutions for the control inequalities are global , thus ensuring global existence for the euler / ns cauchy problem . in section [ galegen ]",
