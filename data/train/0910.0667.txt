    "0.4cmwe know that the electromagnetic ( em ) form factors of the proton and deuteron are usually extracted from the measurements of the differential cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath1 elastic scatterings and from the rosenbluth separation method @xcite , which is based on one - photon - exchange ( ope ) approximation . for a long time , the extracted @xmath3-dependences of the nucleon em form factors are believed to behave like a simple dipole form . for the proton electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath4 ,",
    "one conventionally assumes @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the proton magneton .",
    "recently , the new experiments of the polarized @xmath2 elastic scattering were precisely carried out at jefferson laboratory @xcite .",
    "the polarization transfer scattering experiments of @xmath7 show that the ratio @xmath8 behaves like @xmath9 .",
    "it means that @xmath10 is no longer a simple constant as implied in eq .",
    ". it monotonously decreases with the increasing of @xmath3 . + one way to resolve this discrepancy , at least partially , is to take the effect of the two - photon - exchange ( tpe ) into account @xcite .",
    "usually , it is believed that tpe is strongly suppressed by em coupling constant @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , it was argued @xcite that due to a very steep decreasing of the nucleon em form factors , the tpe process , where the @xmath3 is equally shared by the two exchanging photons , may be compatible to the ope one .",
    "some calculations of the tpe corrections to the @xmath2 elastic scattering have been done recently @xcite , where only the nucleon state is considered as an intermediate state .",
    "the calculations were extended further with other nucleon resonances , like @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 states , being considered as the intermediate states @xcite .",
    "there were also several other works about the tpe effect on the proton charge radius and on the parity - violating @xcite in the @xmath2 scattering .",
    "the effect on the em form factors of the nucleon in the time - like region was estimated in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to the analyses for the tpe effect on the nucleon em form factors in the literature , it is known that the tpe corrections not only modify the conventional nucleon electric and magnetic form factors , but also provide a new form factor , @xmath16 , to the nucleon .",
    "+ the tpe corrections to the deuteron ( spin 1 particle ) em form factors and to the @xmath17 process have been also discussed in refs . @xcite qualitatively . in analogy to the tpe effect on the proton em form factors , tpe not only modifies the conventional three em form factors of the deuteron , but also provides new form factors with new structures .",
    "the general discussion of the structures of the three new form factors can be seen @xcite .",
    "we know that the deuteron is usually regarded as a weekly bound system of a proton and a neutron ( see fig .",
    "many calculations for the em form factors of the deuteron , with the ope approximation , have been performed in different approaches in the literature ( see for example , refs .",
    "recent calculations based on an effective lagrangian approach @xcite have shown that this approach can reasonably explain the deuteron em form factors with phenomenological including two - body operators .",
    "+        to study the tpe effect on the deuteron system in our effective lagrangian approach , we note that the deuteron em form factors receive the tpe corrections from three different sources . the first one ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is that the two photons directly couple to the contact points ( the contact point a ( or b ) of fig .",
    "1 is the one connects the deuteron to its composites ) .",
    "the second is that one of the two photons directly couples to one of the nucleons and another to one of the contact points ( see fig .",
    "the last one is that the two photons respectively couple to the two nucleons ( see fig .",
    "it has been proved that gauge invariance preserves in our effective lagrangian approach only when the three kinds of the two - photon exchange diagrams are considered simultaneously @xcite .",
    "+ in our previous work @xcite , only a part of the third type of the tpe corrections to the em form factors of deuteron is considered , where the tpe corrections to the em form factors @xmath18 and to @xmath16 of the proton and neutron are directly employed to study the deuteron properties following the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the approach",
    ", only one new form factor appears .",
    "the tpe effect considered in @xcite is represented by figs .",
    "4(a ) , 4(b ) and their cross - box diagrams . in this paper , to extend the work of @xcite further , we ll simultaneously study the three sources of the tpe effect in figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "it should be stressed that although the contribution of the coupling of a photon to the contact point is expected to be smaller than the one of direct couplings of the photon to the nucleons , this type of couplings is needed in order to guarantee gauge invariance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the above mentioned two - photon - exchange effect in the @xmath1 elastic scattering",
    "is briefly discussed .",

    "they can be expressed , in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as @xmath40 the normalizations of the three form factors are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",

    "consequentially , it is expected that the forward compton scattering amplitude based on our effective approach is consistent with the low energy theorem .",
    "it should be mentioned that the above correlation function of eq . ( 11 ) , in the non - relativistic approximation , stands for the wave function with only s - wave of the deuteron , which does not contain any d - wave component . to reasonably explain the data for the deuteron quadrupole moment",
    ", we have to phenomenological include two - body operators @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of the photon - deuteron compton scattering amplitudes in the low photon energy region of our approach and of the low energy theorem will be explicitly given in a our separate paper .",
    "+ in our approach , the coupling @xmath87 of @xmath88 is determined by the compositeness condition  @xcite .",

    "if the size parameter @xmath77 is fixed , the coupling @xmath87 is fixed too according to the compositeness condition ( 13 ) ( see detail in @xcite ) . here , we reiterate that since figs .",
    "2 , 3 and 4 are taken into account simultaneously , gauge invariance preserves in our effective lagrangian approach .",

    "here , it should be mentioned that the assumption of @xcite means that each of the photons carries approximately half of the transferred momentum @xmath100 .",
    "it is justified on the bases of ref .",
    "moreover , the assumption also means that a rapid decreasing of the form factors is employed such one can neglect the dependence on the loop momentum @xmath101 in the denominators of the photon green function as well as in the arguments of the form factors .",
    "this results in ultraviolet divergences of the loop momentum integrals with respect to the momentum @xmath101 .",
    "thus , a step function @xmath102 is introduced in the loop integration .",
    "it is equivalent to apply a cut - off restriction @xmath103 . for the photon green function",
    ", we have @xmath104 with @xmath105 . in our calculation for the effect of tpe based on the effective lagrangian of eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we face two loop - integrations .",
    "one is the loop integration with respect to the intermediate momentum of @xmath101 , and another is the one with respect to the intermediate momentum @xmath106 of the composites of the deuteron ( see fig . 5 ) . to simplify the numerical calculation further",

    "6 - 8 , one can not explicitly see the @xmath30-dependence of the three ratios , since the dependences are strongly suppressed due to the fact that the denominators of the ratios in eq .",
