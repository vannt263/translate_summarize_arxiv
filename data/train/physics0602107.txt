    "continuous - time diffusion processes are at the basis of much of the modeling work performed every day in finance and economics .",
    "indeed , since bachelier s pioneering work on the application of probability theory to the dynamics of stock prices @xcite , many economic variables subject to unpredictable fluctuations , have been modeled by stochastic differential equations of the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the drift , describing a deterministic trend , and @xmath2 is the volatility function , describing the level of randomness introduced by the wiener process ( i.e. , white noise ) , @xmath3 . the main reason for the popularity of this class of models is probably that in continuous time one can perform analytic calculations using the instruments of stochastic calculus , and the powerful framework of partial differential equations . in particular , for the few cases for which the process ( [ diffusiony ] ) is exactly solvable , one can derive closed - form solutions for the associated transition probability .",
    "the latter contains all the statistical properties of the financial quantity modeled by the diffusion , and can be exploited in a variety of ways , including the derivation of no - arbitrage prices for financial derivatives in complete markets .",
    "the milestone results derived by black , scholes and merton @xcite , cox , ingersoll and ross @xcite , or vasicek @xcite , are among the most significant examples of the amount of progress in economics that has been done using integrable continuous - time diffusion processes .",
    "nonetheless , an accurate description of the market observables requires in general more sophisticated models than those for which an analytic solution is available .",
    "these are usually tackled by means of numerical schemes ultimately relying on a discretization of the diffusion , obtained by replacing the infinitesimal time @xmath4 with a finite time step , @xmath5 .",
    "the approximate results obtained in this way become exact only approaching the limit @xmath6 , and this can be done with some computational effort .    in this paper , we utilize the _ exponent expansion _  a technique introduced in chemical physics by makri and miller @xcite  to derive a short - time approximation of the transition probability of the diffusion process ( [ diffusiony ] ) .",
    "the aim is to obtain an analytic approximation which is as accurate as possible for a time step @xmath7 as large as possible . on one hand , this allows one to derive approximations of financial quantities that are very accurate even for sizable values of the time step . on the other",
    ", it allows a reduction of the computational burden of numerical schemes as the limit @xmath6 can be achieved with larger time steps , i.e. , with less calculations .    the possibility to use makri and miller s technique to derive approximations of the transition probability",
    "was originally hinted by bennati _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we explore this possibility , giving derivations for a generic diffusion process with state - dependent drift and volatility , and we study the reliability of the exponent expansion by applying it to several diffusion processes of financial interest .    through the exponent expansion",
    ", the transition probability is obtained as a power series in @xmath5 which becomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of terms is included , and provides remarkably accurate results even truncating it to the first few ( say , @xmath8 ) terms .",
    "two derivations are offered , the first by means of kolmogorov s forward equation @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ expa ] ) , and the second introducing a slightly different formalism ( sec .  [ alternative ] ) .",
    "the latter , once the problem is formulated in terms of feynman s path integrals @xcite , allows the generalization of the exponent expansion to the calculation of the pricing kernel of financial derivatives whose underlying follows the considered diffusion .",
    "this allows in turn the derivation of simple approximations for the price of such contingent claims ( sec .",
    "[ prickern ] ) . in sections [ app1 ] and [ app2 ] , we illustrate the exponent expansion through the application to the vasicek , the cox - ingersoll - ross , and the constant elasticity of variance models , and in section [ montecarlo ] we discuss its application to monte carlo calculations within the path integral framework @xcite .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions and we discuss further possible developments in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we derive the exponent expansion for the transition probability , @xmath9 , giving the likelihood that the random walker following the process ( [ diffusiony ] ) ends up in the position @xmath10 at time @xmath11 , given that it was in @xmath12 at time @xmath13 .",
    "although the derivation can be generalized to the case where drift and volatility have an explicit time dependence , here for simplicity we will restrict the discussion to the time homogeneous case . in order to make the derivation easier , it is convenient to transform the original process in an auxiliary one , say @xmath14 , with constant volatility @xmath15 .",
    "following at - sahalia @xcite , this can be achieved in general through the following integral transformations @xmath16 where the choice of the sign is just a matter of convenience depending on the specific problem considered .",

    "similarly , the leading term in @xmath45 ( i.e. , the one proportional to the lowest power of the volatility ) is proportional to the variance of the effective potential over the same trajectory .",

    "we have also shown how the exponent expansion can be naturally used to increase the efficiency of path integral monte carlo simulations . the latter allow one to extend the calculations to arbitrarily large time steps , and to efficiently calculate the greeks of contingent claims , avoiding any numerical differentiation . a systematic study of the efficiency of this approach for the pricing of exotic derivatives will be the object of future investigations .",
