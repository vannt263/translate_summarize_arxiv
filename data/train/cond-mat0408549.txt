    "steps on vicinal crystal surfaces , created by a miscut along a low index plane , have long been of great interest in both basic and applied research.@xcite high quality crystals can be grown through step - flow  the uniform motion of more or less equally - spaced steps  and step bunching instabilities can create arrays of wide flat terrace separated by closely bunched steps .",
    "other arrangements of steps could serve as templates for nanoscale structures and devices .",
    "most fundamental studies of the static and dynamic properties of vicinal surfaces are based on generalizations of the classic theory of burton , cabrera , and frank ( bcf ) , developed more than fifty years ago .",
    "@xcite this theory describes the diffusion of adatoms on terraces with boundary conditions at steps , which are treated as sharp line boundaries .",
    "originally bcf assumed that the steps acted as perfect sinks and sources of adatoms so that the limiting adatom concentration at the step boundaries always reduces to local equilibrium .",
    "many extensions and modifications of the bcf theory have been suggested to provide a more general framework for the description of different experiments .",
    "one of the most important was chernov s introduction of linear _",
    "kinetic coefficients _ , which permit deviations from local equilibrium at steps .",
    "@xcite it was soon recognized that in general the kinetic coefficients could be asymmetric.@xcite another generalization permits step _ permeability _ or _ transparency _ , with a term in the boundary condition directly connecting the limiting adatom concentration on adjacent terraces.@xcite these generalized bcf models provide a mesoscopic or coarse - grained description of surface evolution with effective boundary conditions at sharp steps , and we will generally refer to them as sharp step models .",
    "many kinetic instabilities seen in experiments have been successfully described from this perspective using various combinations of boundary conditions . however in general",
    "it is not clear how to connect the choices and values of the effective parameters in sharp step models to the underlying physical processes or how to determine the uniqueness of such a mapping .",
    "a similar difficulty arises in trying to relate `` microscopic '' parameters in kinetic monte carlo simulations of discrete hopping models to the effective parameters in a generalized sharp step model .",
    "very different microscopic models can sometimes seem to give equally plausible mesoscopic descriptions of limited sets of experimental data .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we proposed a novel continuum two - region diffusion model ( ctrm ) , which gave a rather simple and unified description of a variety of current - induced instabilities seen experimentally on vicinal si surfaces .",
    "we will discuss these experiments in more detail later .",
    "the model assumes that diffusion rates in a finite region around a step could be affected by the different local bonding configurations and thus differ from those found elsewhere on terraces . by extrapolating the steady state concentration profiles to the center of the step region",
    ", we obtained a mapping of the parameters in the ctrm to those of an equivalent classical sharp step model .",
    "one surprising conclusion was that _ negative _ kinetic coefficient can arise when the diffusion rate near a step is faster than that on the terraces .    in this paper",
    ", we will provide a more systematic way of deriving the boundary conditions for the continuum sharp step models from a rather general 1d discrete hopping model that permits both asymmetric diffusion in the step region as well as step permeability .",
    "as discussed by ghez and iyer,@xcite such an effective 1d model can result from averaging over relevant 2d configurations of kink and ledge sites on an atomic step .",
    "we then use these ideas to provide a detailed description of electromigration on si(001 ) surfaces , and find a coherent scenario that explains most of the interesting experimental findings .",
    "s that have dimensions of diffusion constants characterize the hopping rates associated with different barrier heights . here",

    "[ fig1nonps_generic ] , where an atomic step site is surrounded by a region of width @xmath1 with generally different diffusion rates , induced by reconstruction or rearrangements of local dangling bonds .",
    "as we will see , this difference can generate effective kinetic coefficients in a sharp step description .    in general ,",
    "the width @xmath1 of the step region with different diffusion barriers should vary for different systems .",
    "however , we find that the essential physics of the hopping model is not strongly affected by specific choices of @xmath1 of order of a few lattice spacings @xmath2 .",
    "thus we analyze the algebraically simplest case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1nonps_generic ] with half - step regions of width @xmath2 .",
    "the more general result , needed in the analysis of si(001 ) experiments , is easily obtained by replacing @xmath2 with @xmath3 , as will become clear later when we compare the results of this generic hopping model to our previous results .",
    "we include here two additional physical features of the step region as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1nonps_generic ] .",
    "one is the possible asymmetry in the diffusion processes in the up and down half - step regions , described by hopping rates @xmath4 the @xmath5 have dimensions of a diffusion constant , and the model is usefully characterized by dimensionless parameters @xmath6 with @xmath7 the diffusion constant on the terraces .",
    "the other feature we build in is _",
    "step permeability _ or _ transparency _ , characterized in our model by a single parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this can be understood as the effective probability in our 1d model that an adatom hopping to site @xmath10 will encounter a kink site at a given temperature and thus equilibrate with the solid",
    ". this parameter takes account of effects from both kink site density and ledge diffusion in a full 2d model .",
    "when @xmath11 , the step site acts as a perfect sink maintained by either enough kink sites or fast ledge diffusion or both , and consequently the step site concentration will be pinned at equilibrium @xmath12 . in the opposite limit with @xmath13 no adatoms are incorporated into the solid .",
    "the step site behaves like any other terrace site and thus is perfectly permeable .",
    "we neglect other possible sources of permeability , including direct hopping over the step region from one terrace to another or effects of rapid step motion , @xcite which we believe are less physically relevant for our cases of interest . in this section",
    "we will also consider only diffusion fluxes from concentration gradients , and discuss the case of driven diffusion from an external field in the appendix .",

    "in the quasi - static limit the net change in the number of adatoms at each terrace site given by a total flux balance must vanish , i.e. , @xmath22 for all @xmath23 in particular , at sites @xmath24 , the balance of fluxes is given by @xmath25 .",

    "equations ( [ eq : bcfgen]-[eq : p ] ) are the central results in this section . as mentioned earlier , we find that the sharp step boundary condition can indeed be generally expressed using linear kinetics with permeability .",
    "more importantly , we are able to relate the effective parameters in the sharp step boundary conditions to the physically suggestive parameters we considered in our generic hopping model .",
    "this mapping provides a simple way to understand many aspects of electromigration phenomena on si surfaces .",

    "we now consider some limits of the above general expressions to illustrate some interesting features of both the kinetic coefficients and the permeability rate .",

    "( [ dps ] ) also holds to lowest order even when there is an external driving field that affects processes in the step region .",

    "this application of our general results will be discussed in more detail below .    in the following",

    "the two sides of the step are decoupled and any change of the microscopic rates on one side of the step does not affect the kinetic coefficient on the other side .",

    "the sharp step model corresponding to the steady state can be extracted .",
    "the subsequent step bunching instability for a parallel current was discussed by liu _",
