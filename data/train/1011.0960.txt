    "three - body charmless hadronic @xmath10 meson decays offer one of the best tools for studies of direct @xmath0 violation and provide an interesting testing ground for strong interaction dynamical models .",
    "the present work , part of a program devoted to the understanding of rare three - body @xmath10 decays  @xcite , is motivated by the recent babar dalitz - plot analysis of the @xmath16 decays  @xcite . in an isobar model description ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find evidence for the @xmath17 but , within the current experimental accuracy , no significant signal for the @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath13 , not explicitly included in that analysis , could be part of the non - resonant background .",
    "furthermore , there is a small but visible contribution of the @xmath11 resonance  @xcite .    here",
    ", the aim is to provide a phenomenological analysis of the @xmath16 decay channels relying on the qcd factorization scheme ( qcdf ) in the @xmath5 effective mass range from threshold to 1.64  gev .",
    "the focus will be set on the final state @xmath5 interactions involved since a partial wave analysis of the dalitz plot should use theoretically and phenomenologically well constrained @xmath5 amplitudes .",
    "studies of @xmath10 decays into two - body and quasi - two - body final states have been performed in the qcdf framework  @xcite .",
    "the naive factorization approach is a useful first order approximation which receives corrections proportional to the strong coupling constant @xmath18 at scales @xmath19 and @xmath20 and in inverse powers of the @xmath21 quark mass @xmath19  @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we propose an extension of these results to the three - body decays @xmath22 .",
    "the role of the @xmath13 ( or @xmath23 ) in charmless three - body decays of @xmath10 mesons has been examined by gardner and meiner  @xcite in @xmath24 decays . within qcd",
    "quasi two - body factorization approach their @xmath25 amplitude is described by a unitary pion scalar form factor constrained by @xmath26 scattering and chiral dynamics .",
    "this is different from the relativistic breit - wigner parametrization used in most experimental analyses and in some theoretical studies , for example in  @xcite .",
    "this has led to improved theoretical predictions ; the contribution of the @xmath27 channel has been found to be important in the range of the dominant @xmath28 intermediate state .",
    "however , in recent @xmath24 dalitz plot analyses  @xcite no contribution from @xmath29 channel has been found .",
    "this could be linked to the present limited statistics in the low effective @xmath5 mass region .",
    "furthermore , such a contribution could be hidden in the nonresonant amplitude introduced in the experimental analysis .",
    "nevertheless we will show that the contribution of the @xmath2 wave is important in the @xmath30 decays .",
    "charmless three - body decays of @xmath10 mesons have also been investigated by cheng , chua and soni  @xcite in the framework of quasi two - body factorization approach using resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "in particular they have calculated the @xmath31 branching fractions and @xmath0 asymmetries and found a small rate for @xmath32decay .",
    "an achievement in the theory of @xmath10 decays into two mesons is the confirmation of the validity of factorization as a leading order approximation .",
    "no proof of factorization has yet been given for the @xmath10 decays into three mesons .",
    "however , three - body interactions are suppressed when specific kinematical configurations with the three mesons quasi aligned in the rest frame of the @xmath10 meson are considered .",
    "this is the case in the effective @xmath33 mass region smaller than 1.64  gev in the dalitz plot where most of the @xmath33 resonant states are visible .",
    "such processes will be denoted as @xmath34 $ ] , the mesons of the [ @xmath35 pair moving more or less , in the same direction in the @xmath10 rest frame .",
    "then , it seems reasonable to postulate the validity of factorization for this quasi two - body @xmath10 decay  @xcite assuming that the [ @xmath33 ] pair originates from a quark - antiquark state .    in the factorization approach",
    "the @xmath37 $ ] decay amplitudes are expressed as a superposition of appropriate effective qcd coefficients and two products of two transition matrix elements .",
    "the transition matrix elements between the @xmath38 meson and the @xmath39 pion multiplied by the transition matrix elements between the vacuum and the @xmath40 $ ] pion pair correspond to the first of these products . here , in the @xmath41 center of mass frame , the bilinear quark currents involved force the @xmath42 $ ] pair to be in @xmath2 or in @xmath3 state .",
    "the second term is associated to the product of the transition matrix elements between the @xmath38 meson and the @xmath42 $ ] pion pair in @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 state by the transition matrix elements between the vacuum and the @xmath39 pion .",

    "the vertex functions are in turn assumed to be proportional to the pion scalar form factor for the @xmath2 wave , to the vector form factor for the @xmath3 wave and to a relativistic breit - wigner formula for the @xmath4 wave . here",
