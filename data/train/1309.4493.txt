    "17p / holmes is a distinguished comet because of its spectacular outbursts in 1892 and 2007 .",
    "there is no other known comet that has exhibited such large - scale outbursts .",
    "however , its size and orbit are typical among jupiter - family comets : 17p / holmes has a radius of 1.621.71 km @xcite and orbital elements typical of the jupiter - family comets ( e.g. , a tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter of 2.86 ) and most probably originated from the trans - neptunian region @xcite .",
    "it passed through perihelion at 2.05 au on 4.5 may 2007 and suddenly outbursted on 23 october 2007 at 2.44 au from the sun in its outbound orbit .",
    "soon after the outburst , intensive research was conducted to characterize its physical and chemical properties .",
    "the optical magnitude data were compiled and the onset time of the outburst was estimated to be 23.7 october @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite updated the onset time to @xmath6 october based on observations obtained with superwasp - north .",
    "@xcite deduced the duration of the active phase of the outburst to be @xmath7 days .",
    "in contrast , @xcite indicated that the nucleus was activated by the outburst and its activity continued for over 30 days .",
    "small grains were dominant near the nucleus after the outburst whereas large grains were dominant gradually , probably because small grains were kicked out by solar radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the mineralogical properties of the dust grains were studied by mid - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "it is found that the infrared spectrum of the diffuse emission can be explained by a mixture of amorphous and crystalline silicate materials as observed in most comets @xcite .",
    "total ejecta mass was estimated to be 10@xmath810@xmath9 kg @xcite .",
    "more than a 2-m - thick surface layer could be blown off by the initial event although this is strongly dependent on the size distribution and maximum size of the dust particles @xcite .",
    "cometary fragments were also found by optical wide - field imaging .",
    "@xcite detected 16 fragments having a maximum effective size of 10100 m. the evidence of decameter - sized fragments may suggest that @xmath1010 m surface layer could be excavated by the outburst . @xcite",
    "detected two absorption features at 2 and 3  and suggested that the 17p / holmes cloud contained a significant fraction of pure water ice .",
    "it is unlikely that the outburst was triggered by an impact of a small object not only because the probability is incredibly low @xcite but also because of evidence that multiple - outbursts occurred on the same comet in 1892 @xcite .",
    "several possible scenarios have been presented to explain the cause of the outburst ; these include vaporization of pockets of more volatile ices such as co@xmath11 and co @xcite , the phase change of water from amorphous to crystalline ice @xcite , thermal stress in the nucleus , or the polymerization of hydrogen cyanide @xcite .",
    "so far , according to our present knowledge of the physical and chemical structure of comets , co inclusions are likely to be the most probable cause of comet 17p / holmes s outburst @xcite .    despite the intensive observations soon after the explosion , however , little is known about the change in activity between before and after the outburst .",
    "it is important to know the nucleus s pre - outburst physical state and how the nuclear surface changed through the outburst .",
    "we found a unique pre - outburst data of 17p / holmes serendipitously obtained by akari , an infrared astronomy satellite , two months before the 2007 outburst .",
    "in addition , we performed optical imaging over @xmath13 years to monitor the long - term variation of the comet s appearance and magnitude . from our results , we confirmed that the comet was observed in a dormant state before the 2007 outburst when it was near perihelion whereas it had been active after the outburst even beyond 5 au , exhibiting a wide - spread dust tail .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction in section 2 , and the observational results are presented in section 3 .",
    "the data presented in this paper were taken with four ground - based telescopes and one space infrared telescope : the nishi - harima astronomical observatory ( nhao ) nayuta 2.0-m telescope ( hereafter nhao ) , the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope ( uh2.2 m ) , the indian institute of astrophysics 2.0-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) , the subaru 8.2-m telescope ( subaru ) , and the akari space infrared telescope .",
    "in addition , we made use of data from the smoka archive , which is operated by the astronomy data center , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "all optical data were taken more than one year after the outburst when the comet was located at a heliocentric distance of 3.84 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath12 5.17 au . the infrared data from akari were obtained before the 2007 outburst when the comet was at @xmath14 au . a list of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "details of the data acquisition and reductions are given in the following .",
    "the nishi - harima astronomical observatory ( 1342008e , 350131n , 449 m ) is a public astronomical observatory that conducts public relations activities .",
    "our observations were conducted as a part of the nhao @site program , which was contrived as a means of public outreach to introduce visitors into cutting - edge astronomy through research experiences @xcite .",
    "we thus made observations with the @site program participants .",
    "we employed mint , a n@xmath15-cooled optical ccd camera mounted on the f/12 cassegrain focal plane with a focal reducer and @xmath16-band filter . in this configuration ,",
    "the pixel size on the sky was 0.276 , so that the field of view was @xmath17 .",
    "the observations of 17p / holmes were made using non - sidereal tracking on 23 and 26 december 2008 and 16 january 2010 under photometric conditions .",
    "the average seeing size was 1.9  on 23 december 2008 , 2.0  on 27 december 2008 , and 1.6  on 16 january 2010 , respectively .",
    "the 2.0-m ritchey - chretien himalayan chandra telescope is located in hanle , india ( 785751e , 324646n , 4500 m ) , a high - altitude area in the himalayan region .",
    "it is operated by the indian institute of astrophysics ( iia ) .",
    "we made observation on 29 march 2011 with the himalaya faint object spectrograph ( hfosc ) @xmath18 pixel ccd camera at the f/9 cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "the telescope was controlled via a satellite from the crest campus near bangalore .",
    "half of the imaging area of hfosc was sampled so that the effective field of view was @xmath19 with a pixel scale of 0.296 .",
    "we made observation with an @xmath16-band filter on the first night while without filter on the second night .",
    "the observation was performed under photometric conditions .",
    "point sources on the images were spread out to 2.6  probably because of inadequate adjustment of the focus position or vibration of the telescope by strong winds .",
    "subaru is an 8.2-meter optical - infrared telescope at the summit of mauna kea , hawaii , operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , national institutes of natural sciences .",
    "we carried out the observation of 17p / holmes with the wide - field camera suprime - cam @xcite attached to the prime focus of the 8.2-m subaru telescope for two nights on 7 january 2011 and 5 june 2011 .",
    "the camera has a @xmath20 field of view with ten @xmath21 ccds , whose pixel size is 0.20 . since there are gaps of a few arcseconds ( over ten arcseconds between the ccd chips ) , we dithered the telescope to make up for the gap areas .",
    "five dithering modes were applied for one complete set of images .",
    "we took images with an @xmath16-band filter on 7 january 2011 and with g@xmath22- , r@xmath22- , and i@xmath22-band filters on 9 june 2011 .",
    "these observations were carried out in a non - sidereal tracking mode .",
    "the seeing size was 0.60.8 .",
    "the weather was variable during the first run on 7 january 2011 and photometric conditions prevailed during the second run on 5 june 2011 .",
    "the university of hawaii 2.2-m observation was made for two nights on 45 february 2011 .",
    "we used a tek2k and a kron - cousins @xmath16-band filter .",
    "the individual frames were taken in non - sidereal tracking mode .",
    "the ccd was used in @xmath23 binned mode on 4 february and @xmath24 binned mode on 5 february .",
    "the instrument provides a @xmath25 field of view and a pixel resolution of 0.22   ( in @xmath23 binned mode ) and 0.44   ( in @xmath24 binned mode ) . at the time of the observation , the seeing size was @xmath11.0",
    "the weather conditions for these two nights were photometric .",
    "akari ( which was originally called astro - f ) , launched on 21 february 2006 ut , is a japanese infrared space telescope used to carry out an all - sky survey and pointed observations .",
    "it orbits at an altitude of @xmath1700 km in a sun - synchronous polar orbit along the boundary between night and day sides .",
    "the boresight vector of the telescope is pointed at the solar elongation angle around 90  to suppress the incident thermal flux from the earth and the sun .",
    "akari consists of a bus module and a science module .",
    "the science module consists of a cryogenically cooled telescope of 68.5 cm aperture in diameter and two focal - plane instruments , the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) @xcite and the infrared camera ( irc ) @xcite .",
    "detailed descriptions on the design and operation of akari have appeared in @xcite .",
    "the all - sky survey , conducted between 8 may 2006 and 26 august 2007 , is the major task of the akari project and the first half of the mission period is dedicated to it .",
    "17p / holmes was serendipitously detected with the longer channel of mir in l18w ( 13.925.3 @xmath26 m ) twice on 23 august 2007 .",
    "the observed optical raw data were reduced in the standard manner using bias ( zero exposure ) frames recorded at intervals throughout the nights plus skyflat data .",
    "the data were analyzed using sdfred2 for the subaru data",
    "@xcite and iraf for the other data .",
    "flux calibration was done using standard stars in the landolt catalog @xcite or field stars listed in the usno ",
    "b1.0 catalog @xcite . to convert pixel coordinates into celestial coordinates , we employed the imcoords package in iraf or wcstools . to find the faint dust cloud structure ,",
    "star - subtracted composite images were produced in a method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first made images to align the stars to detect faint stars and galaxies .",
    "we masked the identified objects using @xmath13@xmath27seeing - size circular masks .",
    "we also masked pixels identified as bad in the bias ( hot pixels ) and flat - fielding images ( pixels whose sensitivity was 5% higher or lower than the average ) .",
    "we combined the masked images with offsets to align 17p / holmes , excluding the masked pixels and shifting the background intensity to zero . since the comet moved relative to the stars , it was possible to exclude nearly all masked pixels in the resultant composite image .",
    "the akari infrared images was constructed in the same manner as described in @xcite .",
    "the reduction pipeline process includes a reset anomaly correction , a linearity and flat correction , and internal stray light removal .",
    "we applied the conversion factor of 4.3 mjy / sr / adu in l18w ( d. ishihara 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "figure [ fig : irimage ] shows the pre - outburst mid - infrared image of 17p / holmes taken with akari on 23 august 2007 .",
    "it consists of a near - nuclear dust coma and a faint tail extended toward the southwest .",
    "figure [ fig : optimage ] shows the time - series post - outburst optical images of 17p / holmes between 30 october 2007 and 5 february 2011 . for reference ,",
    "images taken soon after the initial outburst are shown in figures [ fig : optimage](a ) and ( b ) ; these were acquired with the kiso observatory 1.05-m schmidt telescope and archived at smoka .",
    "the dust cloud was initially observed as nearly spherical with respect to the position of the nucleus ( figure [ fig : optimage](a ) ) , and gradually it stretched toward the southwest ( figure [ fig : optimage](b ) ) .",
    "as it expanded , the inner coma becomes faint and pointlike ( figures [ fig : optimage](c)(f ) ) . among these images ,",
    "figure [ fig : optimage](e ) is the most sensitive among all of our data . using the composite images with offset to align stars , we estimated a detection limit of 26.7 mag in figure [ fig : optimage](e ) .",
    "because there is no detectable fragment in the image , we put the upper limit of the fragment radius at 400 m. it is important to notice that all images in figure [ fig : optimage ] show the dust tail . obviously ,",
    "17p / holmes possessed a dust tail even when it was located around aphelion at 5.2 au ( figures [ fig : optimage](e)(f ) ) .",
    "however , a pre - outburst observation on 3 may and 3 june 3 2005 revealed no comet - like coma at a heliocentric distance of @xmath28 au @xcite .",
    "this fact may suggest that an inactive dust layer was excavated by the outburst and fresh materials of icy composition were exposed on the surface at the time of our observations . in the following subsections ,",
    "we provide a quantitative analysis of the activities .",
    "we examined radial brightness profiles of the near - nuclear light source to confirm the activity .",
    "we prepared these profiles using akari data on 23 august 2007 , nhao data on 23 december 2008 , uh2.2 m data in february 2011 and subaru data in january 2011 and compared them with the point spread function ( psf ) determined by stars and asteroids ( figure [ fig : radi ] ) . because the image was taken in non - sidereal tracking mode in the optical , field stars were usually stretched out in the comet s images .",
    "infrared data were taken with short exposure time ( @xmath291 s ) , so both the comet and background stellar objects remained stationary in the observed data . among the profiles in figure [ fig :",
    "radi ] , the subaru data on 7 january 2011 is the best for the comparison because we set the individual exposure time of 40 s , which is too short for the field stars to be elongated in the non - sidereal tracking mode .",
    "in fact , the stars can be extended no longer than 0.1   in subaru data on 7 january 2011 . for the akari data",
    ", we used the psf of the average profiles of stars and asteroids in the same scan pass .",
    "we determined the psf of the other data using images before or after the comet observations .",
    "they were usually taken with short exposure times to confirm the position of 17p / holmes after the pointing of the telescopes .",
    "therefore , there may be uncertainty in the time variation of the psfs in nhao data on 23 december 2008 and uh2.2 m data in february 2011 ( figures [ fig : radi](b ) and ( d ) ) , but probably the variations were @xmath300.3 , which is typical at these observational sites .    in figure",
    "[ fig : radi ] , one can see that the surface brightness profiles of 17p / holmes were broader than those of point sources at @xmath30.21  from the photometric center . hence we consider the epoch of the dust emission that is responsible for the broadening of the radial brightness profiles .",
    "the expansion dust speed has been studied in much of the literature .",
    "it depends on how dust particles are coupled with the expanding gas molecules , the expansion velocity of gas molecules , the gas - to - dust mass ratio , and so on .",
    "surface orography and its inhomogeneities also play a significant role in the terminal velocity of the grains @xcite .",
    "although there are many factors to determine the expansion dust speed , it can be approximated by a simple power - law function of the size and the heliocentric distance , that is , @xmath31 @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the radius of dust particles in micron .",
    "@xmath34 is a constant , typically in the range of @xmath35 m s@xmath4 based on theoretical studies @xcite , past observations of normal comet activities @xcite , and cometary outbursts including the 17p / holmes event in 2007 @xcite . from the equation for the expanding speed",
    ", dust particles could escape from a region of 1   aperture in 1.422 hours for @xmath36  and 694 days for @xmath36 cm particles .",
    "since our postburst data were taken @xmath10342 days after the outburst , we can conjecture that the near - nuclear dust particles were not the remnant of the particles ejected by the 2007 outburst .",
    "we discussed the staying time of the dust particles in 0.21   aperture using a sophisticated dynamical model ( appendix a ) , but both model results are consistent with each other in that the near - nuclear dust particles were not the remnant of 2007 outburst .",
    "we next deduced the dust coma magnitude as a function of time and heliocentric distance .",
    "photometry was performed using the apphot package in iraf , which provides the magnitude within synthetic circular apertures projected onto the sky . since the seeing disk sizes were different each night at each observatory , we set the flexible aperture radius to 1.756.50 , which corresponds to 2.5 times the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the sky background was determined within a concentric annulus having projected inner and outer radii @xmath37 and @xmath38 of point objects , respectively .",
    "the observed @xmath16-band magnitudes , @xmath39 , are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the absolute magnitude , the magnitude at a hypothetical point at unit heliocentric distance and observer s distance , and at zero solar phase angle ( sun  object ",
    "observer s angle ) , is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the observer s distance in au and @xmath42 is the solar phase angle in degree .",
    "the empirical scattering phase function , @xmath43 , is given by the following equation @xcite : @xmath44where @xmath45 characterizes the phase slope . @xmath46",
    "mag deg@xmath4 has been commonly assumed for cometary nuclei @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the phase function of active comets is given based on observations of 1p / halley given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xmath47 we found that these different phase functions result in only less than a 1%2% inconsistency at @xmath48   in the range of our observations , i.e. @xmath4913 .",
    "for this reason , we corrected the phase angle dependence of the observed magnitudes using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) with @xmath46 mag deg@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : mag ] shows the absolute @xmath16-band magnitude of the dust coma as a function of the heliocentric distance . in the figure , we subtracted the nuclear magnitude , assuming 1.71-km spherical bodies and a geometric albedo of 0.04 @xcite .",
    "for comparison , we plot the mean magnitude ( the average of maximum and minimum magnitudes caused by the rotating nucleus ) obtained before the 2007 outburst @xcite , where the authors could not find the detectable coma .",
    "figure [ fig : mag ] clearly shows that the photometric magnitudes after the outburst were significantly brighter than the nuclear magnitude .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the radial profiles of the near - nuclear light source were broader than the stellar profiles ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "in addition , there is a trend that the magnitude decreased with increasing heliocentric distance .",
    "this trend can be attributed to the fact that the sublimation rate of ice , which is responsible for the dust emission from the nucleus , could decrease because of low solar flux .",
    "accordingly , we can conclude that 17p / holmes was active and had a faint coma during the time of our observations .",
    "note that the absolute magnitude of active comets depends on the aperture size for the photometry",
    ". a larger physical aperture encloses more dust particles and accordingly the total cross section increases .",
    "@xcite used apertures of fixed physical radius at the position of the comet to eliminate the effect .",
    "it is , however , difficult to fix the physical aperture size for our data because the seeing sizes differed at different sites from night to night .",
    "we adopted a method in @xcite to correct for the aperture size effect .",
    "we converted the magnitude into the cross section and then mass - loss rate , by assuming that spherical dust grains with a certain radii and mass density .",
    "in addition , we utilized the infrared data from akari to derive the dust mass - loss rate before the outburst in the manner described below .",
    "we first calculated the cross section of coma dust particles , @xmath50 , and compared it with the area of the comet nucleus , @xmath51 .",
    "we assumed the 17p / holmes nucleus to be spherical with a radius of 1.71 km @xcite .",
    "we supposed that the scattering properties of the dust particles are the same as those of the nucleus because of the small phase angles in our data set .",
    "we thus assumed a geometric albedo of 0.04 and a scattering phase function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) for the dust particles .",
    "second , we derived a parameter @xmath52 defined as the ratio of the coma cross section @xmath50 to the nucleus cross section @xmath51 . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "@xmath52 is proportional to the ratio of the flux density scattered by the coma , @xmath53 , to the flux density scattered by the nucleus cross section , @xmath54 , which enables us to characterize the contribution of dust particles in the coma @xcite , that is , @xmath55    for the mid - infrared data , it is improper to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq11a ] ) for the derivation of @xmath52 because the thermal properties of dust particles are largely different from those of cometary nuclei .",

    "we assumed that 17p / holmes emitted small dust grains , that is , @xmath78 m. we supposed the mass density of dust particles to be @xmath79 kg m@xmath80 .",

    "in addition to our data , we compared the dust mass - loss rate to data from previous research . as we previously mentioned , @xcite could not detect any coma at 4.66 au before the outburst and put an upper limit on an unresolved coma of 24.6 mag .",

    "moreover , we refer to the dust mass - loss rate derived in @xcite .",
    "the observation covered when the comet was at 2.492.50 au . they derived the mass - loss rate in a manner similar to ours .",
    "they thus obtained the mass - loss rate by assuming spherical dust grains with radii of 1   and a bulk density of 1000 kg m@xmath80 .",
    "in figure [ fig : qdust ] , it is clear that the mass - loss rate significantly increased after the 2007 outburst .",

    "there are two minor peaks on 12 november 2007 and 5 january 2009 , indicating minibursts occurred at those epochs @xcite .",
    "we now consider a model to predict the dust mass - loss rate based on a thermal balance on the surface .",
    "we assume that this element of the surface is in instantaneous equilibrium with solar radiation and the latent heat of sublimation of ice .",

    "we infer that there could be remnants of large dust particles in the physical aperture @xcite or that the nucleus was still in an extraordinarily excited state in the aftermath of the 2007 outburst .",
    "infrared space observations of periodic comets suggested that the mass - loss rate of dust trail particles is comparable to that inferred from oh production rates or larger than that inferred from visible - light scattering in comae @xcite .",
    "a theoretical model to simulate the recurrent outburst nature of the 17p / holmes outburst shows favorable results when @xmath1050.6 @xcite .",
    "model 2 ( @xmath106 ) and model 3 ( @xmath93=1.00 ) are therefore reasonable models among these five .",
    "when we adopt these models , we can derive the fractional active area , as shown in figure [ fig : frac ] .",
    "the fractional active area was 0.200.38 over the time of our observations but increased to 0.64 when the miniburst occurred .",
    "the @xmath103 values are larger than the average for short - period comets ( @xmath290.2 on average ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note again that the dust mass - loss rate derived from the observation strongly depends on the particle size .",
    "if we assume 10 - -sized particles , the fractional active area is saturated to be unity . therefore , we conclude that a significant fraction of the surface of 17p / holmes was still active .",
    "so far , we derived the dust mass - loss rate under the assumption of small particles ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) .",
    "the model has been widely used in previous research ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it also permits a direct comparison with the previous study of the 17p / holmes dust mass - loss rate given in @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of large particles as well as micrometer - sized particles is widely confirmed based on telescopic observations @xcite , remote - sensing observations with spacecraft onboard cameras @xcite , and in situ measurements of cometary dust particles @xcite .",
    "the detection of a cometary dust trail associated with 17p / holmes with spitzer is definitive evidence that 17p / holmes had ejected large dust particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that @xmath10600   particles could be ejected by the 2007 outburst .",
    "millimeter - wavelength continuum observations also suggested the existence of submillimeter particles @xcite .",
    "we hence examined the dust particle size using our observed composite images .",
    "orbits of dust grains are , in principle , determined by the size and the ejection speed .",
    "the size of the particle can be parametrized by @xmath107 , the ratio of the solar radiation pressure to the gravitational attraction . assuming a spherical particle , we can define @xmath107 as@xmath108 where @xmath33 and @xmath74 are the particle radius in meters and the mass density in kg m@xmath80 .",
    "@xmath34 = 5.7 @xmath70 10@xmath109 kg m@xmath71 is a constant and @xmath110 is the radiation pressure coefficient averaged over the solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "supposing that particles are compact in shape and large compared to the optical wavelength , we considered @xmath110 as unity .",
    "as an initial guess , we drew the syndyne and synchrone curves .",
    "syndynes are curves representing a constant value of @xmath107 when the ejection velocity is assumed to be zero .",
    "synchrones are curves representing the positions of particles of different sizes ( i.e. , different @xmath107 ) ejected at the same time with zero velocity .",
    "figure [ fig : sync - synd ] left shows a comparison between the observed contour maps and the syndyne curves of @xmath36 , 10 , 100 , 1 mm , and 1 cm .",
    "we selected two composite images on 23 december 2008 and 7 january 2011 because synchrones and syndynes are well separated in these images . from the syndyne curves ,",
    "the loci of larger particles , @xmath1111 cm , match the center of the dust tail .",
    "this suggests that big particles are dominant in the cross - sectional area in the dust tail . from the synchrone curves , particles ejected more than one year before the observation match the position of the dust tail ( figure [ fig : sync - synd ] right ) .",
    "it is likely that the dust particles ejected soon after the outburst were responsible for the dust tail .",
    "synchrone  syndyne analysis , however , tends to lead to a misleading value of dust sizes @xcite .",
    "a three - dimensional analysis , which allows nonzero ejection velocities to be considered , is appropriate to estimate the particle sizes and mass - loss rate .",
    "here we applied a three - dimensional analysis to match the observed images , following the model in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the dust particles were ejected symmetrically with respect to the sun ",
    "comet axis in a cone - shape jet with half - opening angle @xmath112 , implying that the active regions are distributed ubiquitously over the surface of the nucleus and therefore that the dust emission occurred homogeneously around the subsolar point .",
    "the model also suggests that the dust particles were ejected independently of the rotation of the nucleus .",
    "given that the ejection speed was a power - law function of heliocentric distance , we adopted an empirical function for the ejection terminal velocity of dust particles : @xmath113    where @xmath114 is the reference ejection velocity of the @xmath115 particles at @xmath116 .",
    "we set @xmath117 and @xmath118 au , respectively . @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the power indices of @xmath107 and the heliocentric distance @xmath13 dependence of the ejection velocity .",
    "a random variable @xmath121 follows the gaussian probability density function , @xmath122 , which is given by the following formula : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is standard deviation of @xmath121 .",
    "we set @xmath124=0.25 . from this method ,",
    "most @xmath121 ( 68% ) has a value ranging from 1-@xmath124 to 1+@xmath124 .",
    "a power - law size distribution with index @xmath125 was used , i.e. , @xmath126 in the size range of @xmath127 @xmath12 @xmath33 @xmath12 @xmath128 .",
    "we derived the above parameters to fit the morphology of the dust cloud .",
    "we focused on the positions of the extended dust tail and the flux ratio between coma and extended structures .",
    "the input and best parameters sets are summarized in table 3 .",
    "we show an example simulation image to compare with the observational data on 23 december 2008 . from the fitting we derived a mass - loss rate at 4.1 au of @xmath10170 kg s@xmath4 .",
    "although there are large uncertainties in these best - fit values , it is clear that the resultant mass - loss rate is significantly larger than the rate we derived based on the small - grain model in section 3.3 .",
    "we hereby consider the total mass of the ejecta and the depth excavated by the 2007 outburst .",
    "there is a big uncertainty in the total mass in the range of 10@xmath810@xmath9 kg @xcite .",
    "in addition , little is known about the excavated depth by the initial outburst . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the power index of the size distribution and the maximum size of the particles are critical factors to derive the total mass .",
    "the fraction of the active area is a crucial factor in determining the depth . in the previous subsection",
    ", we confirmed that 1mm1 cm particles were ejected from the nucleus .",
    "the power index of the size distribution was derived to be 3.43.6 , which is consistent with previous studies @xcite . moreover , we deduced the fractional active area of 0.200.38 .",
    "it is reasonable to think 2038% of the surface materials were blown out by the initial outburst if the surface condition remained constant after the outburst . using these parameters and assuming the mass density of the particles and the nucleus are @xmath74=1 g cm@xmath80 and @xmath130=0.5 g cm@xmath80 , respectively",
    ", we could update the total mass and newly derive the depth excavated by the 2007 outburst in the same manner as @xcite .",
    "we found that the total mass of the ejecta was in the range of 5.3@xmath7010@xmath131 6.1@xmath7010@xmath132 kg .",
    "the derived mass is consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was found that 76m1600 m of surface materials were excavated by the initial outburst .",
    "since the upper limit of the depth , 1600 m , is equivalent to the nuclear radius , our upper limit may not be a realistic estimate .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that more than 76 m surface materials were blown off by the 2007 outburst .",
    "we measured the color of the dust within an aperture radius of 1.0  plus the nucleus using subaru data on 6 june 2011 .",
    "the observed magnitudes are @xmath133 ( g@xmath22 band ) , @xmath134 ( r@xmath22 band ) , and @xmath135 ( z@xmath22 band ) , respectively .",
    "the photometric magnitudes were converted into vri magnitudes using transformation equations from smith et al .",
    "we derived the color indices @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "these color indies are consistent with those of the nucleus before the outburst , that is , @xmath138 and @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "they are also similar to the average of jupiter - family comets but different from most kuiper belt objects @xcite .",
    "because the old surface was excavated and fresh surface was exposed in our data , the color may be inherent to fresh comets , that is , icy bodies in the solar system .",
    "we have outlined the observational evidence of 17p / holmes activity before and after the 2007 outburst and found the followings :    * the nucleus highly depleted its near - surface icy component before the 2007 outburst .",
    "* it had been active even near the aphelion passage in 2010 . *",
    "the surface fractional active area was @xmath140 before the outburst whereas it enlarged by a factor of @xmath150 after the 2007 outburst under the assumption of a small - dust - grain model . *",
    "the nucleus color was similar to that of the dust particles and to the pre - outburst color of the nucleus . *",
    "more than 76 m surface materials were blown off by the 2007 outburst .",
    "we expect that long - term monitoring observations during the 2014 perihelion passage and even later will give important information about how the active nucleus depletes its near - surface ice .",
    "+ we express our gratitude to the participants of the @site program for helping with our observations .",
    "we shared a joyful occasion with the public visitors at nhao .",
    "use of the uh2.2 m telescope was supported by naoj , and hct observation was assisted by the observatory staff at the indian institute of astrophysics .",

    "in the second paragraph of section 3.1 , we provided a simple theory to explain the cause of broadening in figure [ fig : radi ] , which helps us to understand the broadening in a straightforward manner .",
    "a similar theory was given in @xcite .",
    "it is important to check the consistency of the discussion with the three dimensional model we provided in section 3.5 .",
    "we examined whether the outburst dust particles contributed to the broadening in our images using our three dimensional model .",
    "the motion of the dust particles is more complicated than we discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "dust particles expand because of the initial velocity , but at the same time , some dust particles ejected sunward are affected by the solar radiation pressure .",
    "figure [ fig : appendix ] shows time - series simulation images of dust particles ejected on 23 october 2007 based on the three dimensional model .",
    "there is no circular envelope as observed in figure 2 ( a ) and ( b ) most likely because the model simulates the low velocity component . in the figure ,",
    "two circles denote the aperture radius of 0.2   and 1 , respectively . within the aperture , we observed the broadening in all data sets .",
    "we found that the brightest part of the cloud , which could contribute the broadening of radial profiles , was detached @xmath110 months after the outburst . since our postburst data were taken @xmath1011 months after the outburst , dust particles ejected by the outburst could not contribute the broadening of the radial profiles .",
    "it is natural to think 17p / holmes showed the broadened brightness profile because it was active when we made the observations .",
