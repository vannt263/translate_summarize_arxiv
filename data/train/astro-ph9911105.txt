    "stresses developing in the crust of an evolving neutron star could fracture the crust (  a starquake ) , possibly affecting the star s spin evolution and generating high - energy emission .",
    "spin down ( , in isolated pulsars ; @xcite ) or spin up ( , in accreting neutron stars ) changes the equilibrium shape of the star , building stresses . in `` magnetars '' , decay of the superstrong field ( @xmath0 g ) could break the crust and produce episodes of intense gamma - ray emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . differential rotation between the crust and the interior neutron superfluid may also stress the crust to its breaking point ( @xcite ) .",
    "starquake - induced rearrangement of the star s mass distribution changes the star s moment of inertia causing precession and polar wandering ( link , franco & epstein 1998 ; hereafter lfe ) .",
    "anomalous spin behavior might therefore signal the occurrence of a starquake .",
    "such evidence for crust cracking may already exist in several isolated pulsars .",
    "permanent _ offsets _ in period derivative following glitches have been observed in the crab pulsar ( @xcite ) , psr1830 - 08 and probably psr0355 + 54 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed offsets all have the same sign , and correspond to increases in spin - down rate . in lfe we interpreted these offsets as due to permanent increases in the torque acting on the neutron star .",
    "we showed that cracking and readjustment of the stellar crust in response to the star s slow down can increase the angle between the star s spin and magnetic axes , leading to an increase in the spin - down torque in some models of pulsar spin down .    other evidence for cracking of the neutron star crust can be found in the soft gamma repeaters , thought to be strongly magnetized neutron stars ( @xmath0 g ) , or _",
    "magnetars_. unlike radio pulsars which have weaker magnetic fields and are powered by rotation , magnetars are thought to be powered by their intense magnetic fields .",
    "duncan & thompson ( 1994 ; also thompson & duncan 1995 ; 1996 ) have suggested that sgr outbursts represent cracking of the crust by magnetic stresses .",
    "evidence in favor of this hypothesis is the striking statistical similarities between bursts in sgrs and earthquakes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for both phenomena",
    "the energy released per event obeys similar power - law scalings and the waiting times between events are strongly correlated with one another .",
    "the potential importance of violent crust dynamics in neutron star evolution motivates this detailed study of spin - down induced starquakes .",
    "the equilibrium shape for a spinning star is an oblate spheroid which becomes more spherical as the star slows down .",
    "the liquid core is able to change its shape smoothly as the star slows down .",
    "in contrast , the solid crust is strained as it evolves through a continuous series of equilbrium configurations , and eventually will crack if it is brittle . in @xcite , we modeled the neutron star as a homogeneous , self - gravitating , elastic sphere and followed the evolution of strain in its crust as the star spins down . from our calculations",
    "we developed the following picture of starquakes .",
    "crust cracking occurs as equatorial material shears under the compressive forces arising from the star s decreasing circumference .",
    "the star s oblateness suddenly decreases as matter moves to higher latitudes along a slip or _ fault _",
    "plane that is perpendicular to the stellar surface and crosses the equator at an angle of @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "since magnetic stresses suppress shearing near the magnetic poles and across the field lines , starquakes likely originate near the two points on the equator farthest from the magnetic poles and propagate preferentially toward the magnetic poles .",
    "the matter redistribution breaks the rotational symmetry of the star , causing the star to precess .",
    "damping of the precession eventually restores alignment between the angular velocity and angular momentum , ultimately _ increasing _ the angle between the spin axis and the magnetic moment . in some models of pulsar spin - down ( , the vacuum - dipole model )",
    "an increase in the alignment angle between the rotation and magnetic axes increases the spin - down torque .",
    "the magnitude of the starquake - induced changes in the alignment angle are consistent with the changes in the spin - down rates seen in the crab pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations of spin - down offsets in coincidence with glitches indicates some connection between structural readjustments and glitches . for a recent discussion of this possibility ,",
    "see link & epstein ( 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to the more realistic case of a brittle shell floating on a liquid core .",
    "we find that the stresses induced by the star s spin down produce similar behavior to that found in lfe .",
    "crust cracking associated with other sources of stress , such as magnetic or superfluid stresses , will be considered in future work .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ phys - pict ] presents a qualitative description of the growth and release of strain in the crust of an idealized , spinning - down neutron star . in  [ the - math ] , we calculate the response of the crust s shape as it spins down , treating the star as a homogeneous solid afloat on a liquid core . in ",

    "we discuss the effects of a magnetic field anchored in the crust .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes our results .",
    "our analysis is based on the assumption that the neutron star crust is brittle , and therefore cracks when sufficiently strained .",
    "we consider a neutron star spinning with angular velocity @xmath2 which undergoes a change @xmath3 in its rotation rate where @xmath4 .",
    "our goal is to describe the effects on the star s crust resulting from this change in rotation rate . in equilibrium",
    ", the star has a spheroidal shape with an equatorial bulge of relative size @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radius of the non - rotating configuration and @xmath7 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "as the star spins down , the fluid interior readjusts its shape continuously , following ( in the homogeneous case ) a sequence of maclaurin spheroids ( see , , chandrasekhar , s. 1987 ; p.77 ) . as the solid crust attempts to readjust its shape , however , strain builds .",
    "material originally at @xmath8 is displaced to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the _ displacement field_. the local distortion of the solid is given by the _ strain tensor _ ( see , , landau & lifshitz 1959 ; p.3 ) @xmath11 in a local coordinate system in which this matrix is diagonal , the eigenvalues @xmath12 represent compression ( @xmath13 ) or dilation ( @xmath14 ) along the respective axes .",
    "let the largest and smallest eigenvalues be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the _ strain angle _ is @xmath17 , and we refer to the plane containing the corresponding principal axes as the _ stress plane_. in fig .",
    "1 we show schematically a block of matter that is compressed along the @xmath18 direction and allowed to expand along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the stress plane then is parallel to the @xmath20 plane .",
    "the elastic limit of the matter is reached first in the regions of the crust where the strain angle is maximum . there",
    "the material cracks , forming a fault plane perpendicular to the stress plane ( fig .",
    "matter slips along the fault plane and redistributes in a way that reduces the equatorial circumference , thus releasing the strain .",
    "the fracture geometry depends on where the strain angle is maximum and how its value changes over the crust .",
    "we now turn to a calculation of the spin - down induced strain in the neutron star crust .",
    "to explore the accumulation and release of strain in a slowing neutron star , we model the star as a two - component homogeneous spheroid ; a self - gravitating core of incompressible liquid on which rests a crust of uniform density .",

    "we require four boundary conditions to specify the four coefficients .      at the outer boundary",
    "the crust encounters a vacuum , while at the inner boundary it is in contact with the liquid core . since neither of these media support traction ,",
    "two boundary conditions follow from requiring that no shear exist at each boundary , , @xmath69 or , @xmath70 in terms of the coefficients @xmath71 @xmath72 two other boundary conditions follow from requiring that the material be in mechanical equilibrium at the boundaries .",

    "we have required @xmath78 just above the star and have taken @xmath79 in the liquid core .",

    "the corresponding displacement field is shown in fig .",
    "2 . from the displacement field",
    "we can calculate the strain distribution resulting from spin down .",
    "the strain tensor ( [ strain_tensor ] ) can be diagonalized to obtain the strain angle and the planes along which the material can shear .",
    "the geometry of crust cracking can be obtained from an analysis of the distribution of strain angles over the crust , to which we now turn .",
    "as the star spins down and the strain increases , the crust breaks when the local strain angle reaches a critical value .",
    "3 shows contours of constant strain angle through the crust ; the strain angle is maximum at the crust - core boundary , in the equatorial plane . fig .",
    "4 shows the three eigenvalues of the strain tensor at the inner boundary of the crust plotted as a function of latitude .",
    "the strain angle , shown by the darker curve , shows discontinuous derivatives where the maximum and minimum eigenvalues change .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the strain angle for a homogeneous elastic sphere model ( @xcite ) at the same depth for comparison . in the equatorial plane ( @xmath103 ) ,",
    "the stress plane is the @xmath104plane .",
    "an element of matter on the equatorial plane is compressed by adjacent elements on the equator and expands in the @xmath105 and @xmath106 directions .",
    "material compressed in this way shears along one of two planes that takes an angle of @xmath107 with respect to the compressive force ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "1 ) . once the crust breaks , matter moves along faults @xmath108 or @xmath109 , inclined at an angle @xmath110 to the rotational equator ( see fig .",
    "since the strain field has azimuthal symmetry , the break is equally likely to begin at all points on a ring corresponding to the intersection of the crust core boundary with the equatorial plane .",
    "the inclusion of magnetic stresses , discussed below , breaks this symmetry .",
    "the propagation of the crack is a nonlinear process ; cracking affects the strain field , which in turn affects the propagation of the crack . in general , cracking increases the stress on unbroken neighboring material ( @xcite ) , causing the fault plane to grow in both width and length .",
    "hence , the crack begins at the base of the crust in the equatorial plane , propagates toward the surface , and continues to grow up to some latitude .",
    "when the cracking ends , the strain field is everywhere subcritical .",
    "the width and length of the fault plane can not be determined from the linear analysis given here .    in this treatment",
    ", we have ignored the fact that the neutron star crust is stratified .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "[ [ perturbed ] ] shows that the most important material property controlling the development of strain is @xmath111 ; in particular , where @xmath111 is small , the strain must be large .",
    "strohmayer (  1991 ) calculated @xmath111 as a function of density in the neutron star crust and found that it varies by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "cracking of the crust is favored in regions where @xmath111 is small , possibly causing the quake epicenter to be somewhat higher than the base of the crust .",
    "we expect that the effects of density stratification will not affect the overall geometry of crust cracking described here .",
    "we now examine the effects of the magnetic field that is anchored to the crust of the neutron star .",
    "the displacements induced by the spin down distort the magnetic field , generating magnetic stresses .",
    "if the magnetic field is not precisely aligned with the rotation axis , the magnetic stresses will break the azimuthal symmetry of the strain distribution in the crust .",
    "a complete description of the strain field that develops in magnetized material is obtained by solving the elasticity equations and maxwell s equations self - consistently , subject to boundary conditions at the star s surface .",
    "the surface boundary conditions , however , are complex to handle ; in a realistic neutron star they depend on the exact form of the density gradients near the surface . to qualitatively illustrate the influence of the star s magnetic field on where starquakes originate and how they propagate , we consider the simpler problem of the magnetic fields effect on the material strain in an unbounded medium .    in the absence of the field , the equilibrium state is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 represents gravitational and centrifugal forces .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field introduces several forces .",
    "first , the unperturbed field can exert a force on the crust .",
    "for this study , we assume that the initial field @xmath115 is dipolar and hence force free ; that is , the unperturbed maxwell stress tensor @xmath116 obeys @xmath117 in the crust .",
    "next , the displacement field in the crust distorts the field by @xmath118 , generating a perturbation @xmath119 to the maxwell stress tensor . where @xmath120 is the alfvn speed and @xmath111 is the transverse sound speed . in the outer crust , we have @xmath121 and we are justified in treating the magnetic effects perturbatively . ] the new equilibrium is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the magnetically",
    "induce change in the material stress tensor .",
    "for an infinite medium ( or a finite one in which boundary effects are unimportant ) , the solution is @xmath124 .",
    "magnetic stresses modify the displacement @xmath125 by @xmath126 . for a magnetic field that is sufficiently small that this correction to the displacement field is small ( @xmath127 ) , the perturbation to the maxwell stress tensor is @xmath128,\\ ] ] with @xmath129 here",
    "@xmath125 is the displacement field in the absence of the magnetic field . for incompressible matter , the correction @xmath130 to the strain tensor is @xmath131 where @xmath29 is the shear modulus .",
    "the eigenvalues of this tensor give the correction to the strain angle due to the induced magnetic forces .",
    "using the displacement field of eqs .",
    "( [ ur ] ) and ( [ ut ] ) in eq . ( [ delta - b ] ) , we obtain an estimate of the corrections to the strain angle on the star s rotational equator ; these are shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic field affects our picture of crust cracking in two ways .",
    "first , the existence of the magnetic field strengthens the material , making it harder to shear .",
    "the material is weaker and hence most likely to shear where the magnetic field is weakest .",
    "consider a star with a dipolar magnetic field inclined at an angle @xmath132 to the rotation axis . in this case",
    "the material may begin shearing at the two points on the rotational equator that are farthest away from the magnetic poles as shown in the schematic of fig .",
    "6 . second , as the material attempts to move along the fault planes , the magnetic field opposes displacements that cross field lines and hence favors matter motion long fault @xmath108 over fault @xmath109 .",
    "this motion moves matter closer to the magnetic poles .",
    "this picture is essentially the same as found for a simpler homogeneous sphere model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have examined the evolution of strain in the crust of an idealized spinning - down neutron star and the initiation of starquakes as the material reaches critical strain .",
    "we modeled the neutron star as a self - gravitating core of incompressible liquid that supports a brittle crust .",
    "crust cracking occurs as material shears under the compressive forces arising from the star s decreasing circumference .",
    "the star initially cracks near the star s rotational equator , at the base of the crust .",
    "the shearing motion along the fault decreases the oblateness of the star and pushes matter to higher latitudes .",
    "magnetic stresses suppress shearing near the magnetic poles and across the field lines .",
    "starquakes thus originate near the two points on the equator farthest from the magnetic poles and propagate toward the magnetic poles .",
    "our conclusion is qualitatively the same as found in our simpler homogeneous spherical model ( @xcite ) .    as material slides along a fault directed toward the magnetic poles , the star s principal axis of inertia shifts _ away _ from the magnetic axis , exciting precession .",
    "eventually , damping restores alignment between the principal axis of inertia and the angular momentum axis , increasing the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes . in some models of pulsar spin - down , , the magnetic dipole model ,",
    "this growth in the alignment angle increases the spin - down torque .",
    "we might , therefore , expect to see a tendency of alignment angle to increase with age in young pulsars .",
    "in older pulsars , however , tauris & manchester ( 1998 ) , find no relationship between magnetic alignment angle and spin - down torque .",
    "one possible observational signature from a starquake is a change of the pulse profile .",
    "a jump in the alignment angle @xmath132 changes the duration of the line of sight s traverse through the pulse emission cone . in the crab pulsar ,",
    "the relative change in pulsed flux could be of order 1% ( link & epstein 1997 ) .",
    "additionally , the energy released in a starquake could produce an observable enhancement of the star s luminosity .",
    "the energy release is of order @xmath133 ergs , where @xmath29 is the average shear modulus along a fault of length @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the strain angle at which fracture occurs .",
    "some fraction of the seismic energy will be damped , heating the crust .",
    "eventually , a soft x - ray thermal wave will emerge from the star s surface . for localized deposition of @xmath136 ergs at a density of @xmath137 g @xmath138 , tang ( 1999 )",
    "calculates a 5% enhancement of the star s luminosity occurring about 3 yr after the quake for a star with an internal temperature of @xmath139 k and a stiff equation of state . for deposition at @xmath140 g @xmath138 in a star with an internal temperature of @xmath141",
    "k , the enhancement is @xmath142% .",
    "the chandra x - ray observatory should be capable of detecting this enhancement in a closer source , such as the vela pulsar .",
    "a starquake could drive non - thermal emission as well .",
    "seismic energy that reaches the stellar surface couples to alfvn waves which propagate into the magnetosphere .",
    "conversion of alfvn waves into @xmath110-rays could occur if the waves are charge - starved or if their amplitudes are comparable to the background field strength of the magnetosphere ( blaes  1989 ) .",
