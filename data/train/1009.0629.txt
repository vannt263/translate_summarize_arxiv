    "translating a grid in a closed volume of fluid is a standard way to generate an approximately homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in order to investigate its temporal decay .",
    "although the level of homogeneity and isotropy of the turbulence generated in this way is not as good as in the more conventional configuration of a fixed grid in an open wind tunnel,@xcite this closed flow configuration has proved to be very useful when a compact system is needed , and in particular when experiments are performed in a rotating frame.@xcite apart from early experiments performed in wind tunnels with a rotating section,@xcite all rotating grid - generated turbulence experiments since then are based on oscillated or translated grids in closed containers .",
    "although grid turbulence in open and closed geometries share similar properties , large scale recirculations are more likely produced in the closed configuration.@xcite these reproducible flows , which will be called mean flows in the sequel , can be easily extracted thanks to ensemble average over several independent realizations .",
    "they may actually be triggered from inhomogeneities in the wake of the grid , or from spontaneous symmetry breaking in a perfectly symmetric geometry . in the case of decaying turbulence , although the kinetic energy of the mean ( i.e. , ensemble - averaged ) flow may be negligible compared to that of turbulence soon after the grid translation , it may persist over large times and possibly influence the final period of decay of turbulence .    in the presence of background rotation , grid - generated turbulence may excite inertial waves .",
    "these waves are anisotropic transverse dispersive waves , which propagate through a rotating fluid because of the restoring nature of the coriolis force.@xcite their pulsation @xmath0 lies in the range @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the rotation rate , indicating that these waves can be excited when the characteristic time of the considered flow is of order of the rotation period , i.e. when the rossby number is of order unity .",
    "these inertial waves may originate either from a mean flow , in which case they are reproducible and can be detected in the ensemble - average , or from turbulence itself , in which case they are non reproducible and cancel out by phase mixing in the ensemble - average .    in grid - generated turbulence experiments performed in a closed container , still in the presence of rotation ,",
    "reproducible oscillations induced by inertial modes have been reported.@xcite a first mechanism responsible for these modes is the resonance of multiply reflected inertial waves over the container.@xcite another possibility is that they originate from direct conversion of the energy of the large scale recirculations initiated by the grid translation , which were also present in the non - rotating case , when the characteristic time of these recirculations decreases down to the order of the rotation period .",
    "inertial modes can be found in general in a container when the walls are either normal or parallel to the rotation axis , whereas wave attractors are found when sloping walls are present.@xcite only the former are considered in the following .",
    "their resonant frequencies can be derived analytically only in some specific geometries , such as the so - called kelvin modes in a cylinder rotating about its symmetry axis.@xcite in the case of a parallelepipedic container , the frequencies and the spatial structure of the eigenmodes have been characterized in detail by maas@xcite for an inviscid fluid from numerical simulations .",
    "inertial modes excited in grid - generated turbulence have been first observed in a parallelepipedic channel with a free surface by dalziel,@xcite who pointed their potential influence on the decay of the turbulent component of the flow .",
    "inertial oscillations are also clearly visible in the experiments of morize and moisy@xcite ( with a rigid upper surface ) and moisy _ _ et al.__@xcite ( with a free surface ) . they have been characterized by bewley _ _ et al.__@xcite in a set of two experiments , in which a grid is rapidly drawn in liquid helium or nitrogen in cylindrical and squared geometries .",
    "these authors found good agreement between the measured frequencies and the numerical results of maas@xcite for various aspect ratios .",
    "they conclude that translating a grid in a closed rotating container does not allow to generate freely decaying turbulence , because a significant amount of the energy goes into inertial modes . in all these experiments ,",
    "these inertial modes are detected in the ensemble - averaged flow , suggesting that they are more likely produced by reproducible flow features , than from turbulence .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate in more details the structure of the inertial modes excited when towing a grid in a rotating square container , and to explore to what extent those modes may be reduced .",
    "an experimental setup similar to that of morize _ _ et al.__@xcite has been mounted on a new rotating platform , allowing for particle image velocimetry measurements in a vertical plane .",
    "we demonstrate that , by attaching a set of inner sidewalls to the grid , the amount of energy stored in the inertial modes may be drastically reduced .",
    "a similar configuration has been first shown by staplehurst _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite to reduce significantly the large - scale recirculations in the absence of rotation .",

    "interestingly , inertial modes are not only absent from the mean flow spectrum , @xmath73 but also from the turbulent spectrum @xmath86 .",
    "this indicates that their disappearance in the modified grid configuration can not be attributed to a change in the nature of the excited inertial modes , from reproducible to non reproducible , but to a true disappearance .",
    "the differences in the energy decays and spectra show that the addition of the inner tanks to the grid leads to a much more efficient transfer of the initial mean flow energy into turbulence , bypassing the generation of inertial modes . however , the origin of the changes between the two configurations is not clear . in particular ,",
    "it is not evident if , and how , the differences in the jet profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : vitgrille](c ) may explain the preferential energy transfer from the mean flow to the turbulence in the modified configuration .",
    "these results illustrate the sensitivity of the inertial modes production to slight changes in the grid geometry , at least for the grid rossby number considered here , @xmath110 .",
    "in this article , we characterize in details the flow generated when a simple grid is rapidly translated in a rotating and confined volume of fluid .",
    "we show that , in addition to a non - reproducible turbulent flow , the grid translation initiates a reproducible mean flow composed of resonant inertial modes , which contains a significant amount of the total kinetic energy .",
    "this observation agrees with the recent experiments of bewley _",
    "et al._@xcite in a similar geometry .",
    "in addition to quantitative comparisons of the mode frequencies with the numerical predictions of maas@xcite , we also provide here good qualitative comparisons for the spatial structure of these modes .",
    "these results suggest that the turbulent ( i.e. the non reproducible ) component of the flow generated in this configuration can not be considered as freely decaying . indeed",
    ", energy transfers between the inertial modes and the turbulence may exist , so that the energy initially stored in the inertial modes may continuously feed the turbulence .",
    "however , measuring this transfer would require to compute the turbulent reynolds stress tensor and its coupling with the ensemble - averaged flow .",
    "this can not be performed from the piv data presented here , which are limited to two velocity components in a single plane .",
    "the ability of a translated grid to generate or not reproducible inertial waves or modes depends on the grid rossby number , @xmath111 , and also on the geometrical details of the grid configuration , in particular its solidity ( ratio of solid to total area ) .",
    "indeed , for a given grid geometry , a low rossby number seems more likely to excite inertial modes , because the reproducible wake pattern of the grid , or the induced reproducible recirculation flow , may directly force inertial modes with a phase coherence . on the other hand",
    ", we could speculate that , for much larger rossby numbers ( and assuming that the reynolds number is very large too ) , the reproducible wake pattern has more time to loose its coherence before being affected by rotation , so its energy may be more efficiently transferred to turbulence than reproducible inertial modes .",
    "even if inertial waves are generated from these decaying incoherent motions , their random phase should cancel them out in the ensemble average , so inertial modes should not be found in the mean flow .    in the experiments of bewley _",
    "et al._,@xcite the moderate grid rossby number @xmath112 of 5.5 is found to produce strong inertial oscillations . in the experiments of staplehurst _",
    "et al._,@xcite @xmath112 lies in the range @xmath113 , so that significant inertial modes are also expected , although they are not described by these authors .",
    "finally , in the present experiment , for a slightly larger grid rossby number of 10.4 , the production of reproducible inertial modes is found to be very sensitive to slight details in the geometry of the grid .",
    "indeed , by adding a set of inner tanks to the grid , we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the production of inertial modes , although the mechanism responsible for this preferred energy transfer towards turbulence instead of modes is not elucidated in the present work .",
    "this sensitivity of the flow evidenced for this particular @xmath112 is consistent with the results of morize and moisy,@xcite covering a range of @xmath112 between 2 and 65 , in which a smooth transition around @xmath114 is found in the decay law of the turbulent energy , suggesting a change in the energy transfer between inertial modes and turbulence .",
    "from those results , one may conclude that , providing the grid rossby number and the geometrical features of the grid are carefully selected , achieving a nearly `` pure '' rotating turbulence , free of reproducible inertial modes , is actually possible in a confined geometry .",
    "this system is therefore suitable to explore experimentally the influence of the rotation on freely decaying turbulence .",
    "we acknowledge c. morize and m. rabaud for discussions about the manuscript , and a. aubertin , l. auffray , c. borget , g .- j .",
