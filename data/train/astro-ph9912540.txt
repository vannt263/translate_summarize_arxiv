    "since the late 1970s , it was known that the low mass pre - main sequence t tauri stars were surrounded by disks . for instance , the lack of correlation between the ( near infrared ) excess and the extinction had led to the suggestion that the cool material producing the excess was located in a geometrically flat configuration ( cohen & kuhi 1979 ) . however , it was not until the first _",
    "iras _ observations of tts appeared that the large mid and far infrared excesses were attributed to accretion disks ( rucinski 1985 ) , in agreement with the original suggestion of lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) .",
    "masses and radii for these disks were estimated from submillimeter and millimeter observations around the late 1980 s .",
    "the indirect inference for disks from all these observations was dramatically confirmed in this decade , when disks around young stars have been directly imaged by instruments on board of _",
    "disks are seen against the bright background of the orion nebula as silhouettes ( mccaughrean & odell 1996 ; mccaughrean et al .",
    "1998 ; stauffer et al . 1999 ) , and in the favorable edge - on situations , where the direct light from the star is blocked by the disks , so the faint glow of stellar light scattered by dust grains on the disk surface can be seen .",
    "a number of cases have been presented so far ; the best known and analyzed include hh30 ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) and hk tau / c ( stapelfeldt et al 1998 ) .",
    "these disks are the predecessor of planetary systems .",
    "t tauri disks are composed of gas and dust .",
    "the mass in the disk is of the order of a few 0.01 @xmath0 , and matter is still accreting onto the star . on the other extreme , in disks with planetary systems ,",
    "most of the mass is on the planets , a few 0.001 @xmath0 , and only small amount of dust ( @xmath1 ) remains .",
    "the transition between these two stages is of upmost interest .",
    "what are the processes that lead to planet formation and in which timescales ?    in this contribution , we argue that the first signs of the transition to planetary disks appear in the inner disk , within a few au from the star , and then when this transition starts , it happens very fast .",
    "we will review evidences provided by two groups of different ages , 1 - 2 myr and 10 myr .",
    "we then will argue that present and future observations in the optical and infrared can not tell us what is happening near the midplane of the inner regions of the gas and dust disks characterizing the initial stages before the transition . only alma , in the highest resolution configuration ,",
    "will allow us to scrutinize the innermost disk and to obtain information on the processes occurring to the dust in these regions leading to the formation of planets .",

    "the large infrared excesses due to disk emission are apparent .",
    "disk emission depends on the temperature of the disk , which in turn , is determined by the amount of heating .",
    "two agents can heat the disk : viscous dissipation related to accretion , and stellar irradiation . for the typical values of the mass accretion rates in the disks around ctts ( gullbring et al . 1997 ; hartmann et al . 1998 ) , irradiation from the central star plays a dominant role in the heating of the disk ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 , kh87 ; dalessio et al .",
    "1998 , 1999a , b , c ) .",
    "heating by irradiation will depend on the shape of the disk surface , since disks with flared surfaces can capture more stellar radiation than flat disks ( kh87 ) . in turn , the scale height of the disk , and therefore the height of the surface , depends on the disk temperature .",
    "a self - consistent stability analysis of irradiated disks for typical ctts parameters indicates that a unique , stable solution for the surface exists , and corresponds to a flared surface ( dalessio et al .",
    "this means that disk emission will be determined essentially by how much energy comes into the disk , set by the star , and how much of this energy is actually absorbed and re - emitted by the disk , which depends on the dust in the disk .",
    "most stars in taurus shown in figure 1 have spectral types between k7 and m3 , so they have similar amounts of stellar irradiation . the large dispersion observed in the seds must essentially be due then to differences in the dust properties in the disk , indicating that even though the stars have similar ages ( 1 - 2 myr , gomez et al .",
    "1993 ) , there is a large diversity in the conditions of the dust in these disks .",

    "1997 ) and v819 tau ( m. meyer , personal communication ) .",
    "these stars are weak tts , that is , they are not accreting mass onto the star . the indications of disk accretion , i.e. , broad emission line profiles , uv excesses , which characterize ctts are not present in these stars , nor are near - infrared excesses . however",
    ", mid - infrared and even millimeter flux excesses persists , indicating that remnants of the disk are still there . some other transition cases may exist and remain to be discovered , but not in large numbers ; the total number of transition cases may be less than 10 , which when compared to the total number of tts in taurus , @xmath3 100 , indicates that the loss of the disk happens fast .",
    "the actual processes causing disk dissipation are not well known , and binary companions may play a crucial role in clearing the disks ; but in any event , the processes leading to disk dissipation occur in very short timescales , compared to the lifetime of a typical t tauri star .",

    "although tw hya itself has been known for many years ( herbig 1978 ; rucinski & krautter 1983 ; de la reza et al .",
    "1989 ) as an `` isolated t tauri star '' , it is not until recently that this extremely interesting association has begun to be extensively studied . the main problem has been finding its members , since molecular gas is no longer associated with the association .",
    "most of the members found are turning out to be weak tts , but a few of them still show indications of disk emission , similar to the mean sed in taurus in the mid and far - ir and in the millimeter ( figure 3 ) .",
    "again , in some cases , a deficit in the near - ir compared to longer wavelengths seem to be present .",
    "the evidence provided by young stars in the two extremes of the temporal range where disks are expected to dissipate and planets to form ( @xmath3 10 myr , podosek & cassen 1994 ) indicates that disks can last for a very long time , but once clearing starts , it occurs in very short time - scales .",
    "the first signs of disk clearing seem to appear in the near - ir , indicating that the higher temperature regions in the inner disk are the first to clear up .",
    "this is is consistent with the evidence provided by debris disks ; for instance , in the youngest debris disk known , around the a0 star hr 4796a , @xmath3 8 myr ( jayawardhana et al . 1998 ; koerner et al . 1998 ) , a possible member of the tw hya association , disk emission is only apparent beyond 10 microns .",

    "eventually , a planet ( or planets ) forms in the disk , and a gap is opened at the position of the planet ; the inner disk is accreted onto the star , while a considerable fraction of the remaining mass of the disk goes into planet formation .",
    "disks around ctts must be in the very first stages of this sequence ; once planets form and gaps appear , the evolution happens very fast , and it may prove difficult to find disks with gaps , still retaining the inner disk .",

    "the optical depth at @xmath13 m , at the peak of the stellar radiation , is always much larger than 1 , since dust opacity is high at optical and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , the rosseland mean optical depth , which corresponds to the optical depth to the local radiation , falls below 1 beyond @xmath3 10 au .",
    "this means that the disk is thick to stellar radiation even when it is optically thin to the local radiation ( for instance , in the outer disk . )",
    "this last property implies that the disk can efficiently capture stellar radiation up to a few hundred au , of the order of the estimated radii of ctts ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; dutrey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it also implies that scattered light images of edge - on disks observed with _",

    "as the maximum grain size increases , the opacity decreases in the optical and near - ir , as more of the dust is locked in bigger grains ; at the same time , the opacity increases in the millimeter range .",
    "the effect of grain growth on scattered light images is shown in figure 5 , left .",
    "ism dust produces images where the widths of the lanes separating the bright nebulae above and below the disk are of the order of @xmath3 100 au ( at taurus ) , which is larger than the width of the observed edge - on disks ( dalessio et al .",
    "the width of the lane decreases as @xmath17 increases , as a result of the decreased opacity in the optical and the consequent lowering of the surface where @xmath18 m ) @xmath19 , producing better matches to the observations . at the same time",

    "figure 7 , right , shows the brightness temperature at several wavelengths , for the case of dust with @xmath22 m , well mixed with gas , and viscous heating at each height . because of the large opacity , the temperature in the mid - plane is much higher than the surface temperature .",
    "brightness temperatures in the millimeter are consequently much higher than those obtained if the disk were isothermal",
    ". however , the actual brightness temperatures may be very different if there is a vertically - dependent dust opacity , due to dust coagulation and settling .",
    "moreover , they may be very different if a `` dead zone '' exists near the mid - plane , where viscous generation of energy is not occurring because there is not enough ionization to maintain the magneto rotational instability ( mri , gammie 1996 ; glassdgold et al .",
    "the importance of this dead zone for planet formation is that inhibition of the mri produces an increase of the density near the midplane ( since matter can not be transported inwards towards the star ) , favoring gravitational instabilities and potentially leading to planet formation .",
    "the present evidence from disks around 1 to 10 myr old stars indicates that dust growth and settling leading to planet formation and disk clearing happens fast and starts near the midplane in the few inner au of the disk .",
    "since the inner disk regions are optically thick to radiation shortwards of @xmath3 0.5 mm , only alma in the highest resolution configuration , corresponding to 0.01 \" or 1.4 au at the closest star - forming regions , will allow us to reach the midplane of the planet - forming regions in the disks and study the processes that precede the formation of these bodies ."
