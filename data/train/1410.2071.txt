    "diabetes mellitus type ii ( dm - ii ) is a metabolic disorder which is characterized by resistance to insulin and abnormalities in the hepatic cells in terms of glucose production @xcite .",
    "it has been known to be a complex and multi factorial disease @xcite as it affects various other organ systems in the body like cardiovascular system , kidneys , lungs , eyes etc @xcite .",
    "the who statistics reveals that dm - ii has affected nearly 325 million people till 2013 out of which @xmath0 cases are undiagnosed and the disease show rising trend world - wide @xcite .",
    "diabetes is known to cause 5.1 million death in 2013 and statistical data reveals that every six seconds a person dies from diabetes further probing that it is the fifth leading cause of death in high income countries and an epidemic in developing countries @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most important non - communicable diseases of the 21st century accounted both in terms of mortality and morbidity @xcite .",
    "indecent lifestyle , increased urbanization and unhealthy behaviors are some of the major causes behind the disease @xcite .",
    "recent biological studies indicate that significant increase in population having obesity has in turn become a major reason for higher dm - ii cases @xcite .",
    "some genome wide studies reveal genetic basis of dm - ii by finding some important proteins which are heritable and cause dm - ii further indicating that dysfunctioning of beta cells is another reason for the occurrence of the disease apart from insulin resistance @xcite .",
    "this disease is likely to increase the burden of chronic diabetic complications worldwide in the near future @xcite .",
    "it has been found that treatment of people with diabetes account for up to 15@xmath1 of international health care budgets @xcite . according to a recent study",
    ", a person with this complex disease spends on an average more than @xmath2 in the treatment and its complications over entire lifetime and trillion dollars are spent on health and diseases worldwide @xcite .",
    "an early detection may help in cure to the people with this disease .",
    "but the research pertaining to development of novel treatments and cure methods is very exhaustive @xcite . even after enormous investment in pharmacological research and clinical trials in the past decades",
    ", there has not been proportionate advancement in clinical results .",
    "all these demand for a new perspective in disease research , which we provide here using combined framework of random matrix theory and network theory .",
    "this framework predicts important structural patterns crucial for disease is very time efficient and cost effective .",
    "previously , a network analysis of ppi netwok of dm - ii reveals potential drug targets on the basis of candidate genes involved in dm - ii @xcite .",
    "few network studies done also reveal some important pathways associated with insulin signaling using high - throughput micro - array datasets @xcite .",
    "dm - ii investigated using systems biology approach highlights the occurrence of the disease .",
    "these studies are based on a handful of disease - associated proteins , while our investigation for the first time performs extensive analysis of the whole pancreatic cell proteins .",
    "we investigate dm - ii at the proteomic level using network biology along with the random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "this mathematical theory has been formulated six decades ago in order to understand complex nucleons interactions @xcite .",
    "later on , the theory has shown its remarkable success in understanding various complex systems ranging from quantum chaos to galaxy @xcite . in the current work ,",
    "we construct the protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) network of dm - ii by analyzing normal and disease states of pancreatic cells and investigate their structural properties , which is further compared with the properties of random networks .",
    "the analysis reveals specific structural patterns , as well as nodes contributing significantly to the most localized eigenvector being crucial for the occurrence of the disease .",
    "we study the ppi network of dm - ii , where nodes are the proteins and edges denote the interactions between these proteins . after diligent and enormous efforts",
    ", we collect the protein interaction data from various literature and bioinformatic sources . to keep the authenticity of the data intact",
    ", we only take the proteins into account which are reviewed and cited .",
    "we consider two widely used bioinformatic databases namely genbank from ncbi @xcite and uniprot constituting data available from other resources like european bioinformatic institute , the swiss institute of bioinformatics , and the protein information resource @xcite . to add more information , we take highly studied diabetes mellitus ii cell lines whose protein expression data is known .",
    "here , we use the protein expression data of endoc@xmath3 @xmath4 h@xmath5 cells in the disease dataset @xcite .",
    "since there are a very few human cell lines available , we take the mouse and rat cell lines namely min and ins-1 , proteins of which have already been proved to behave similarly in humans @xcite . after collecting the proteins for both the datasets",
    ", their interacting partners are downloaded from string database @xcite .",
    "we take into account largest sub - networks from the normal as well as from the disease data and investigate their structural and spectral properties .",
    "there are several structural measures used enormously in the last fifteen years in order to understand and characterize the properties of a network @xcite . here",
    "we define only those which are useful for our analysis . to start with ,",
    "let us first define the interaction matrix or the adjacency matrix of the network as follows : @xmath6 the most basic structural parameter of a network is the degree of a node ( @xmath7 ) , which is defined as the number of neighbors the node has ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath9 , revealing the fraction of vertices with degree @xmath10 , is known as the fingerprint of the network @xcite .",
    "another important parameter is the clustering coefficient ( cc ) of the node @xmath11 , which is defined as the ratio of the number of connections a particular node has and the possible number of connections that particular node can have .",
    "clustering coefficient of a network can be written as @xmath12 the average clustering coefficient of the network characterizes the overall tendency of nodes to form cluster or groups .",
    "further , the betweenness centrality of a node is defined as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs that pass through the said node of interest @xcite .",
    "another important parameter is the diameter of the network which measures the longest of the shortest paths between all the pair of nodes @xcite .",
    "eigenvalues of adjacency matrix ( eq .  [ adj_wei ] ) denoted as @xmath13 is referred as network spectra .",
    "further , we use the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) to analyze localization properties of the eigenvectors .",
    "the ipr of @xmath10th eigenvector @xmath14 with its @xmath15th component being denoted by @xmath16 , can be defined as @xmath17 ^ 4 } { ( \\sum_{l=1}^{n } [ e_l^k]^2)^2 } \\label{eq_ipr}\\ ] ] which shows two limiting values : ( i ) a vector with identical components @xmath18 has @xmath19 , whereas ( ii ) a vector , with one component @xmath20 and the remainders being zero , has @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the ipr quantifies the reciprocal of the number of eigenvector components that contribute significantly .",
    "an eigenvector whose components follow porter - thomas distribution yields @xmath22=@xmath23 @xcite , and those which are deviating from this value provide system dependent information @xcite .",
    "we further calculate the average value of ipr , in order to measure an overall localization of the network calculated as @xmath24    .*detailed parameters for normal and disease sub - networks * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * hprt1 ( hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1)- * nucleotide salvage enzymes adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinate lyase were elevated above normal in the diabetic heart , whereas hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase was not altered @xcite",
