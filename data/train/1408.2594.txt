    "for @xmath109 the second minimum in @xmath86 ( [ veff ] ) does not exist and the potential possesses azimuthal symmetry . in this case , the symmetric gauge emerges naturally as the most convenient choice .",
    "the convenience is related with the fact that for this gauge the ground state eigenfunction is real . for @xmath110 the azimuthal symmetry",

    "a question can be posed : in what gauge the ground state eigenfunction is real ?",

    "@xcite),width=480 ]    since we are going to use an approximate method for solving the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hka ] ) , a quality of the approximation of ground state function can depend on the gauge .",
    "in particular , one can ask whether one can find a gauge for which a given trial function leads to minimal variational energy . such a gauge ( if found ) can be called optimal for a chosen trial function .    to this end , it is convenient to introduce a gauge transformation @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are parameters .",
    "the gauge transformed hamiltonian ( [ hka ] ) takes the form @xmath117    where @xmath118 .",
    "this transformation implies that we consider now the schrdinger equation in a linear gauge for which the position of the gauge center , where @xmath119 , is located at    @xmath120    for @xmath97 we expect the gauge center to be localized on the line @xmath90 , between the origin @xmath121 and the second minimum @xmath122 of @xmath86 , ( see ( [ min ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the vector potential can be considered as a variational function and can be chosen by a procedure of minimization as it was proposed in @xcite and realized in @xcite ( see also for discussion @xcite ) . for a moving neutral system ,",
    "the case @xmath123 has been used in the past to study the so - called centered states with wavefunction peaked at the coulomb minimum @xcite . while for the so - called `` decentered '' states it seems natural to consider @xmath124 . the eigenvalue problem @xmath125 where @xmath126 , is the central object of our study hereafter . for convenience ,",
    "in the calculations we used the so called shifted representation , @xmath127 .",
    "if we put @xmath128 and @xmath42 in ( [ hxi ] ) , one can construct the wkb - expansion at large @xmath129 for the phase @xmath130 .",
    "the leading term at @xmath131 is given by @xmath132    similarly , at @xmath133    @xmath134    in the limit @xmath135 we obtain    @xmath136    assuming the condition ( [ psadd ] ) is fulfilled , the potential ( [ veff ] ) has the second minimum at @xmath137 .",
    "hence , the double taylor expansion of the phase at @xmath138 has the form @xmath139 where @xmath140s , @xmath141s and @xmath142s are constants .      following the prescription formulated in @xcite we make an interpolation between wkb - expansion ( [ large]),([largey ] ) and the perturbative expansion ( [ small]),([y0 ] ) and construct a trial function for the ground state of ( [ hxi ] ) in a form of a product @xmath143    where    @xmath144    with @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 variational parameters .",
    "supposedly , they should behave smoothly as a function of a magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned above this problem has some similarity with that of the moving neutral system for which a physically adequate trial function is @xmath148 .",

    "the parameter @xmath150 measures the coupling between cm and relative variables , @xmath151 corresponds to the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we carried out a variational study of the two - body charged system on a plane moving across a magnetic field .",
    "the main emphasis is to explore stability of the system , thus , studying the ground state . for the case of @xmath0 ion ,",
    "the energy for several magnetic fields @xmath152a.u . and values of pseudomomentum @xmath153 a.u",
    ". is presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the energy grows monotonically and rather sharp as a function of a magnetic field for fixed pseudomomentum but at much slow pace as a function of pseudomomentum for a fixed magnetic field .",
    "it is worth noting that for fixed @xmath1 the energy @xmath154 as a function of @xmath4 tends asymptotically to the ground state energy of two non - interacting charges in a magnetic field .    after making a minimization",
    ", one can see the appearance of a sharp change in the behavior of parameters in ( [ phis ] ) as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it is related with a fact of the existence of a certain critical pseudomomentum @xmath155 such that for @xmath156 the optimal linear parameters @xmath157 the wavefunction has a peak near the coulomb singularity ( centered state ) . at @xmath158",
    "the situation gets opposite : the parameters @xmath159 and the wavefunction is peaked near the second well of ( [ veff ] ) , see fig.[vb1 ] ( we call this well the _ magnetic _ well ) which corresponds to a decentered state .",
    "a similar phenomenon appears in the case of a neutral system in 3d @xcite and 2d @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a change in the behavior of parameters results also in a specific behavior of energy dependence ( see for example fig.[e0 ] ) and mean interparticle separation _ vs. _ the pseudomomentum . from physical point of view at @xmath160 the effective depth of the coulomb well and that of the magnetic well get equal .",
    "if @xmath156 the effective depth of the coulomb well is larger ( or much larger depending on a magnetic field strength ) than one of the magnetic well , the system prefers to stay at the coulomb well . if @xmath158 the effective depth of the coulomb well is smaller ( or much smaller depending on a magnetic field strength ) than one of the magnetic well , the system prefers to stay at the magnetic well .",
    "for all studied magnetic fields the barrier between wells is very large , the probability of tunneling from one well to the other is very small . hence , the energy behavior _ vs. _ cm pseudomomentum @xmath4 is defined by one well or another , it is close to classical behavior .",
    "thus , the presence of the second minimum in the effective potential can be neglected .",
    "the results of calculations show that the optimal gauge parameter @xmath161 for all values of magnetic field considered always corresponds to symmetric gauge @xmath42 . the behavior of @xmath8 as a function of magnetic field is presented in fig . [",
    "pcr : fig.3 ] where @xmath8 grows with an increase of @xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of the gauge center parameters ( @xmath162 ) , see ( ( [ uu])-([ygauge ] ) ) , _ vs. _ cm pseudomomentum @xmath4 is shown in tables [ table2]-[table2a ] , respectively . for @xmath156",
    "the parameter @xmath163 is very small , it varies within @xmath164 $ ] for magnetic field range @xmath165a.u .",
    "while for @xmath158 it is close to 1 , it varies within @xmath166 $ ] for magnetic field range @xmath167a.u . at @xmath168 and for any",
    "@xmath4 considered the parameter @xmath169 . at fixed @xmath170 the parameter @xmath171 for @xmath172 and almost constant for @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the gauge as a function of @xmath4 changes from the symmetric gauge centered at the coulomb well ( the singularity of ( [ veff ] ) ) to the symmetric gauge but centered at the magnetic well ( the minimun of ( [ veff ] ) for @xmath174 ) . in turn , the parameter @xmath163 , which mainly determines the value of the gauge center , remains almost equal to @xmath5 up to @xmath160 ( which means the gauge center coincides with a position of the coulomb singularity , then sharply jumps to a value close to @xmath175 ( gauge center coincides with a position of the minimum of magnetic well ) , displaying a behavior which looks like a phase transition .",
    "but it is not a phase transition : the energy changes sharply but smoothly . for @xmath160",
    "the gauge parameters are @xmath176 .",
    "there exists a certain domain of transition from one regime to another .",

    "summarizing , for the two - dimensional @xmath0 ion in a constant magnetic field partial factorization of eigenfunctions ( see ( [ psik ] ) ) allows us to reduce the problem to one with three degrees of freedom . for this reduced problem",
    "we want to state that a simple uniform approximation of the ground state eigenfunction is constructed .",
    "it manifests an approximate solution of the problem .",
    "the key element of the procedure is to make an interpolation between the wkb expansion at large distances and perturbation series at small distances both for the phase of the wavefunction ; in other words , to find an approximate solution for the corresponding eikonal equation . in general , the separation of variables helps us to solve this problem easily . in our case of non - separability of variables the wkb expansion of a solution of the eikonal equation can not be constructed in a unified way , since it depends on the way how we approach to infinity .",
    "however , a reasonable approximation of the first dominant growing terms of the wkb expansion of the phase seems sufficient to construct the interpolation between large and small distances giving rather high accuracy results .",
    "it was demonstrated that for all magnetic fields and all values of pseudomomentum the system is bounded .",
    "its energy grows with magnetic field strength increase as well as pseudomomentum increase . for fixed magnetic field @xmath1",
    ", the energy behavior demonstrates a sharp change for a certain value of cm pseudomomentum @xmath311 .",
    "it seems it can be used to measure the magnetic field strength .",
    "this effect was already mentioned in three - dimensional hydrogen atom moving across magnetic field @xcite .    in the born - oppenheimer approximation ( @xmath192 ) ,",
    "a curious fact that the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) possesses the hidden algebra @xmath312 is worth mentioning .",
    "it can be immediately seen - making a gauge rotation of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in symmetric gauge ( @xmath42 ) with the gauge factor @xmath313 .",
    "we obtain the operator which is in the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath312 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , for specific values of a magnetic field @xmath1 the algebra @xmath312 appears in finite - dimensional representation and the problem admits analytical solutions ( details will be given elsewhere ) .",
