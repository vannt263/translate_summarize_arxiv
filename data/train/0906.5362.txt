    "quark distribution and fragmentation functions are the basic nonperturbative ingredients for a qcd - based analysis of hard scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "distribution functions can be extracted by analyzing inclusive processes  @xcite and their description in terms of effective quark theories of qcd has been quite successful  @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been a significant effort to extract the fragmentation functions by analyzing inclusive hadron production ( semi - inclusive ) processes in @xmath2 annihilation , deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and proton - proton collisions  @xcite . besides being of fundamental interest in their own right ,",
    "knowledge of fragmentation functions is essential for the extraction of the transversity quark distribution functions  @xcite from data , and to analyse several other interesting effects in semi - inclusive processes  @xcite .    because of the importance of the fragmentation functions many attempts have been made to describe them using effective quark theories  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to achieve reasonable agreement with the empirical parametrizations it was necessary to introduce new parameters , like normalization constants , which can not be justified on theoretical grounds . a description of fragmentation functions within effective quark theories , which automatically satisfies the relevant sum rules  @xcite and describes the empirical data reasonably well  without introducing new parameters into the theory  has hitherto not been achieved .",
    "this failure to describe the fragmentation functions in the same framework which is successful at describing the distribution functions is surprising , because there exists a general relation , the so called drell - levy - yan ( dly ) relation @xcite , which suggests a way to compute the fragmentation functions by analytic continuation of the distribution functions into the region of bjorken @xmath3 .",
    "although the derivation of this relation appears to be very general ( as we show in appendix a ) , the basic _ assumption _ that the distributions and fragmentations are essentially one and the same function , defined in different regions of the scaling variable , has not been proven .",
    "moreover , the approximations used to calculate the distribution functions may not be sensible for the fragmentation functions and vice versa .",
    "for example , in the fragmentation process of a quark into a pion , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a spectator , there is no _ a priori _ reason to truncate @xmath5 to a single quark state , as the dly crossing arguments would suggest for the case of a bethe - salpeter type vertex function for @xmath1 .",
    "one can actually give a quantitative argument that the lightest component of @xmath5 is dominant only if the scaling variable @xmath6 is very close to unity  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the phenomenological quark jet - model , as formulated originally by field and feynman  @xcite , suggests that the meson observed in a semi - inclusive process is one among many , that is , the spectator state @xmath5 contains many mesons .",
    "this model is based on a _ product ansatz _ for a chain of elementary fragmentation processes , where in each step a certain fraction of the quark momentum is transferred to a meson , until eventually a very soft quark remains .",
    "this final quark is assumed to annihilate with the other remnants of the process without producing further observable mesons .",
    "in order for all of the quark light - cone momentum to be transferred to the mesons , it is actually necessary to assume an _",
    "infinite _ number of steps ( mesons ) in the decay chain , as will be explained in more detail in section  [ sec : product ] . in this case , it is possible to satisfy the momentum sum rule for fragmentation functions  @xcite , which is assumed valid in qcd - based fits to the data  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this sum rule can not be satisfied in a single step elementary fragmentation process .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply the method of the quark jet - model to calculate the spin - independent fragmentation functions in an effective chiral quark theory , which has proven to be very successful for the description of quark distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on quark fragmentation into pions within the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , however the methods illustrated here can easily be extended to other fragmentation channels and applied within other effective quark theories . in order to reconcile the quark jet - model with our present njl model description , we will introduce a generalized product ansatz , which allows for the fragmentation of a quark into a finite number of pions according to a certain distribution function , and in the end we take the limit of infinitely many pions .",
    "we will show how the momentum and isospin sum rules emerge naturally without introducing any new parameters into the theory .",
    "our numerical results will demonstrate that this njl - jet model provides a very reasonable framework for describing the fragmentation functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : operator ] we begin with the operator definitions for the quark distribution and fragmentation functions and move on to discuss the sum rules and the dly relation . in section  [ sec : elementary ]",
    "we give the expressions for the elementary fragmentation functions in the njl model and discuss their physical interpretations and sum rules . in section  [ sec : product ]",
    "we introduce the generalized product ansatz to describe a chain of elementary fragmentation processes in the spirit of the quark jet - model , derive the integral equation for the fragmentation function and discuss the momentum and isospin sum rules . in section  [ sec : results ] we explain the model framework for the numerical calculations , present results and compare them with the empirical fragmentation functions .",
    "a summary is given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "this is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the result that one can simply substitute @xmath47 leaving everything else unchanged .",
    "we then obtain from eq .",
    "the result @xmath48 where the fragmenting quark now has @xmath43 . according to eq .",

    "can also be a quark , we summarize the definitions as follows : @xmath40 refers to fixed flavours of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while all other quantum numbers of @xmath7 ( spin , color , etc ) are summed over , with those of @xmath8 are fixed .",
    "@xmath49 refers to fixed flavours of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with an _ average _ over the other quantum numbers of @xmath7 ( spin , color , etc ) , while those of @xmath8 are fixed .",
    "this definition has the advantage that in a semi - inclusive process , which involves the product @xmath50 , the quark spin - color summation is included in @xmath51 but not in @xmath52 , which avoids double counting .",

    "where @xmath54 is the spin degeneracy , or , in the general case , the spin - color degeneracy of @xmath8 .",
    "generally however , this relation is not necessarily valid , because @xmath7 is off - shell ( its virtuality being determined kinematically by the scaling variable and the transverse momentum ) and @xmath8 is on - shell , which breaks the naive symmetry under the interchange @xmath55 .    to obtain the momentum sum rule from eq .",

    "this does not influence the result , which depends only on @xmath6 . ]",
    "then one notes that the momentum operator , represented in terms of hadron operators , is given by @xmath58 by assuming that the quark state @xmath59 in eq .",
    "is an eigenstate of this operator with eigenvalue @xmath60 , we obtain the momentum sum rule @xmath61 the physical content of eq .",
    "is that @xmath62 of the initial quark light - cone momentum ( @xmath60 ) is transferred to the hadrons .",
    "the condition which lies at the basis of eq .",
    "is that the initial quark state is an eigenstate of the momentum operator , eq .  , expressed solely in terms of hadrons .",
    "that is , the quark hadronizes completely in the sense that it gives all of its light - cone momentum to the hadrons .",
    "a similar argument leads to the isospin sum rule  @xcite , namely @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the 3-components of the isospins of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the physical content of this sum rule is that all of the isospin of the initial quark is transferred to hadrons , which is possible since the definition in eq .",
    "implies an average over the isospin of the soft quark remainder of a fragmentation chain ( see section  [ sec : product ] ) . in general",
    ", there is no sum rule for the baryon number or electric charge , because the baryon number or average electric charge of the quark remainder is not zero .",
    "if we simply integrate both sides of eq .   over @xmath6 , we get the hadron multiplicity , which can be interpreted as the _ number of mesons per quark_. however , there is no conservation law which leads to a sum rule for the multiplicity .",
    "there is an interesting relation based on charge conjugation and crossing symmetry , between the fragmentation function for physical @xmath66 and the distribution function for unphysical @xmath3 : @xmath67 which is called the drell - levy - yan ( dly ) relation  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are the spins of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , and @xmath70 is the spin - color degeneracy of @xmath7 .",
    "we derive this relation using two independent methods in appendix a. the first approach , which follows the original arguments  @xcite , compares the hadronic tensors for @xmath71 ( inclusive dis ) and @xmath72 ( inclusive hadron production ) , and uses crossing relations for matrix elements of the current operator . the second method  which to the best of our knowledge has not been published before",
    " starts directly from the operator definitions in eqs .   and and uses charge conjugation and crossing symmetries for matrix elements of the quark field operator .",
    "if one has an effective quark theory to calculate the quark distribution functions , eq .   would suggest a straightforward way to obtain the fragmentation functions .",
    "however , as will become clear in the following sections , for the lowest order ( elementary ) processes such an attempt leads to disastrous results .",
    "that is , the fragmentation functions obtained in this way are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the empirical functions and the sum rules in eqs .   and are not satisfied .    the reasons why eq",
    ".   fails in actual applications are as follows : ( i ) it is based on the _ assumption _ that the distribution functions can be continued analytically beyond @xmath73 .",
    "however , it is well known that the @xmath74 evolution equations lead to singularities at @xmath73 , which are ( regularized ) infrared singularities arising from the vanishing gluon mass  @xcite .",
    "these render an analytic continuation impossible .",
    "someone may still argue that eq .   should be used only at the low energy ( model ) scale , however it is actually broken there also , because of the cut - off regularization .",
    "we will discuss this point in detail in the next section .",
    "( ii ) most importantly , approximations which work reasonably well for the distribution functions may not be sensible for the fragmentation functions and vice versa .",
    "for example , the assumption that the pion is a @xmath75 bethe - salpeter bound state is very reasonable for the distribution function  @xcite , but the dly crossing arguments then imply the truncation of the spectator state @xmath14 , of eq .  , to a single quark state .",
    "although this simple assumption does not lead to any violation of conservation laws , the sum rules in eqs .   and can not be satisfied in a single step fragmentation process .",
    "for these reasons , we will not rely on eq .   to calculate the fragmentation functions , although we will confirm its formal validity for the lowest order ( elementary ) functions .",
    "we note that the arguments given above do not question the usefulness of eq .   as a means to relate the kernels of the @xmath74 evolution equations for the distribution and fragmentation functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix b ) .",

    "-1em    several important points are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : frag ] .",

    "secondly , fig .",
    "[ fig : frag]b shows the tremendous enhancement at intermediate and small @xmath6 of the plus - type fragmentation function caused by the cascade processes ( iterations of the integral equation of eq .  ) , while for the minus - type fragmentation function of fig .",
    "[ fig : frag]a a small reduction is seen .",
    "thirdly , the calculated result shown by the solid line has the correct order of magnitude for intermediate and large @xmath6 , when compared with the empirical function .",
    "this point , which reflects the fact that our model satisfies the momentum sum rule , is very important , because effective quark model calculations completed hitherto only considered the elementary fragmentation functions and introduced some ad hoc parameters ( like normalization constants ) to obtain the correct order of magnitude .",
    "quantitatively , figs .",
    "[ fig : frag ] indicate that our fragmentation functions are too big at large @xmath6 and too small at smaller @xmath6 .",
    "this is natural for the following reasons : firstly , we can expect that a nlo calculation will lead to a softening of the fragmentation functions . secondly , some of the observed pions are secondary ones , which come from the decay of primary @xmath265 and @xmath266 mesons .",
    "thirdly , the coupling to other fragmentation channels , in particular the nucleon , antinucleon and kaon , will transfer some amount of the hard quark momentum to these other hadrons .",
    "also , one should not forget that the empirical fragmentation functions have very large uncertainties , which are not indicated in our figures .",
    "nevertheless , figs .  [",
    "fig : frag ] indicate that the present njl - jet model provides a reasonable starting point for the description of fragmentation functions .",
    "[ fig : fragflavour]a shows the results for the favoured fragmentation function of eq .   and fig .",
    "[ fig : fragflavour]b shows the unfavoured fragmentation function of eq .  .",
    "note , these figures correspond to half the sum and half the difference of the curves in figs .  [",
    "fig : frag ] . the upper dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fragflavour]a shows the driving term , @xmath262 , of the integral equation in eq .  , and the lower dash - dotted line shows the elementary fragmentation function , @xmath263 . for the unfavoured case these two functions are zero .",
    "both figures demonstrate the importance of cascade processes in the present njl - jet model .",
    "in this paper we used the njl model as an effective quark theory to study the simplest fragmentation function , namely , the fragmentation of unpolarized quarks to pions .",
    "our aim was to develop a framework which satisfies the momentum and isospin sum rules in a natural way , without the introduction of ad hoc parameters .",
    "this framework should also give fragmentation functions that have the correct order of magnitude at intermediate and large @xmath6 .",
    "we explained in detail , that for this purpose , the simplest approximation where a truncation is made to the one - quark spectator state , in the defining relation given by eq .  , is completely inadequate .",
    "although this approximation does not violate any conservation law , it gives very small fragmentation functions ; because the probability for the elementary fragmentation process is small in effective theories based on constituent quarks and the quark remainder can carry an appreciable amount of momentum .    in order to overcome these difficulties we followed the idea of the quark jet - model and made a generalized product ansatz to describe the cascade processes in the njl model .",
    "we explained that this ansatz corresponds to a binomial distribution for the number of mesons emitted from the quark .",
    "however , in the limit that the maximum number of mesons becomes very large the results are independent of the form of this distribution function .",
    "our formulation thus represents an extension of the original quark jet - model , which assumed an infinite number of mesons from the outset .",
    "we have shown in detail that this njl - jet model describes fragmentation processes where 100% of the initial quark light - cone momentum is transferred to mesons .",
    "the momentum sum rule of eq .",
    ", which is assumed valid in all qcd based empirical fits , is then satisfied automatically without introducing any new parameters into the theory .",
    "we have also shown that the isospin sum rule of eq .",
    "is naturally satisfied in this approach .",
    "the comparison with the empirical fragmentation functions shows that our calculated functions have the correct order of magnitude for intermediate and large @xmath6 .",
    "we highlighted that a straightforward extension to include the nlo terms in the @xmath74 evolution and to include the effect of primary @xmath265 and @xmath266 mesons , as well as fragmentation to other hadronic channels , will improve the description .",
    "therefore we can conclude that our njl - jet model provides a reasonable framework to analyse fragmentation functions in an effective quark theory .    for future work in this direction",
    "it is important to derive the jet model type product ansatz from field theory . the rainbow - ladder scheme for the quark self - energy may provide a suitable framework for this purpose .",
    "an attempt can then be made to use this truncation scheme to consistently describe the cascade processes for the fragmentation functions and to include the contribution from the hadron cloud around the quark for the distribution functions .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that a truncation scheme which works well for fragmentation processes may not be suitable for the distribution functions and vice versa . to establish a scheme which respects the sum rules and which gives a satisfactory description of both types of processes is an important task for future research .",
