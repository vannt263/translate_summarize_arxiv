    "red clump ( rc ) stars are core helium - burning giants .",
    "it is a prominent feature in the colour - magnitude diagrams of open clusters as well as globular clusters .",
    "now , it is known that they are abundant in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this sample of rc stars provides accurate absolute magnitude estimation due to their parallaxes which can be used in testing their suitability for a distance indicator .",
    "a mean absolute magnitude in any band with small scattering can work for the purpose of the researchers .",
    "many works has been carried out for optical and near infrared bands such as @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "their absolute magnitudes in the optical range lie from @xmath10 mag for those of spectral type g8 iii to @xmath11 mag for type k2 iii @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude of these stars in the @xmath12 band is @xmath13 mag with negligible dependence on metallicity @xcite , but with real dispersion .",
    "@xcite claimed an absolute magnitude for the rc stars rather close to the one just cited here , with some limitations however .",
    "based on 14 open clusters , they draw the conclusion that for clusters having @xmath14\\leq0 $ ] dex and @xmath15 gyr , one can use @xmath16 mag .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath9-band magnitude on the rc stars was extensively studied in the past from an observational point of view . in most cases",
    "the @xmath17 mean absolute magnitude is insensitive to age and metallicity @xcite",
    ". however , a modest variation in @xmath17 with colour and metallicity has been claimed in the literature @xcite .",
    "theoretical models from @xcite also show a dependence of metallicity and age in @xmath9 band .",
    "@xcite stated in their study based on the models of @xcite that @xmath18 is a complicated function of metallicity and age .    in a recent work",
    ", @xcite used the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) infrared data for a sample of 24 open clusters to investigate how the @xmath0-band absolute magnitude of the red clump depends on age and metallicity .",
    "they showed that a constant value of @xmath19 mag is a reasonable assumption to use in distance determinations for clusters with metallicity between @xmath50.5 and + 0.4 dex and age between 0.31 and 7.94 gyr . following this work , @xcite claimed two absolute values in different bands for the rc stars , i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 mag , where the estimations were based on newly reduced the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite .    in a more recent work ,",
    "@xcite determined the mean @xmath18 absolute magnitude for rc stars in the solar neighbourhood to within 2 per cent ( @xmath22 mag ) and applied their results to the estimation of the distance of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "a mean value for the @xmath18 absolute magnitude with weak or negligible dependence on metallicity makes possible to use this population as a tracer of galactic structure and interstellar extinction , as several works have fully demonstrated in the last decade ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 and @xmath25 absolute magnitudes of rc stars , identified by a set of constraints in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , were calibrated in terms of colour with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 photometries . in the present paper",
    ", we will focus on a single absolute magnitude , @xmath3 , which is the most probable candidate for adopting as a distance indicator .",
    "our aim is to calibrate the @xmath3 absolute magnitude as a function of colour .",
    "thus , we expect more accurate absolute magnitudes relative to the procedure which adopts @xmath3 absolute magnitude as a constant value .",
    "the procedure is given in section 2 .",
    "the data and the relation between the colour and absolute magnitude are presented in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the application of the procedure is devoted to section 5 , and finally a discussion is given in section 6 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of a star is a function of luminosity class , temperature or colour , age and metallicity . as it is assumed that the rc stars are at the same evolutionary stage , all the rc stars are of the same luminosity class .",
    "hence , we omit this parameter in the absolute magnitude estimation of the rc stars . many studies are based on the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite which involves the solar neighbourhood stars . using the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue is a constraint both in metallicity and age for the sample stars .",
    "this is the reason that the researchers claim weak dependence of the @xmath3 absolute magnitude on age and metallicity .",
    "the advantage of the up - dated _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite is that the errors are smaller than the former edition .",
    "the data of open clusters are also age and metallicity constraint .",
    "for example the age and metallicity intervals for 24 open clusters in @xcite are @xmath29 gyr , and @xmath30\\leq+0.4 $ ] dex , respectively .",
    "however , one can include the metal - poor globular clusters such as ngc 1261 with metallicity @xmath31=-1.35 $ ] dex into the sample used for @xmath3 absolute magnitude estimation of the rc stars . in this case , one expect metallicity- and age - dependent @xmath3 absolute magnitudes . despite age and metallicity limitations for the data used for the @xmath3 absolute magnitude estimation ,",
    "the range of the corresponding colour is large enough for considering in the estimation of the absolute magnitude in question .",
    "for example , the range of the @xmath4 colour of the data used in @xcite and @xcite is @xmath32 mag .",
    "then , one should consider the @xmath4 colour in the @xmath3 absolute magnitude estimation .",
    "that is , we expect more accurate @xmath3 absolute magnitudes for individual rc stars rather than a constant value for the whole sample .",
    "we used the data of @xcite for calibration of the @xmath3 absolute magnitude in terms of @xmath4 colour .",
    "there are 224 rc stars in the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "we provided the _",
    "hipparcos _ number , parallax , metallicity , @xmath0 magnitude , and @xmath3 absolute magnitude from the electronic version of the paper , and we added the @xmath2 magnitude to this catalogue to obtain the @xmath4 colours instead of @xmath1 ones .",
    "the @xmath2 magnitudes are taken from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "the relative parallax errors lie in the interval @xmath33 and their median is 0.03 .",
    "the parallaxes were corrected by @xcite .",
    "the data are given in table 1 .",

    "the @xmath36 colour excess of 20 rc stars have been evaluated in two steps .",
    "first , we used the maps of @xcite and evaluated a @xmath37 colour excess for each star .",
    "then , we reduced them using the following procedure of @xcite : @xmath38.\\ ] ] here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the galactic latitude and distance to the star , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is the scale height for the interstellar dust which is adopted as 125 pc @xcite . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the total absorptions for the model and for the distance to the star , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 can be evaluated by means of the following equation :    @xmath44    @xmath37 is the colour excess for the model taken from the @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath45 , i.e. the colour excess for the corresponding star at the distance @xmath40 , can be evaluated via the equation ,    @xmath46    the colour excess @xmath47 and the classical colour excess @xmath36 have the same meaning .",
    "the same case is valid for the total absorption @xmath48 and the classical absorption @xmath49 .",
    "the metallicities are given only for 100 rc stars .",
    "the diagram for @xmath3 absolute magnitude versus @xmath4 colour index is given in fig .",
    "most of the stars are concentrated in the region with @xmath50 and @xmath51 mag . however , there are about three dozen of stars beyond these limits .",
    "the extreme colours and absolute magnitudes belong to the rc stars with _ hipparcos _ numbers 3781 , 37901 , 38211 , 58697 , 63608 , 70306 , 72471 .",
    "the range of the metallicity of the sample is @xmath52<0.4 $ ] dex .",
    "however , 80 per cent of them lie in a smaller metallicity interval , i.e. @xmath53\\leq + 0.15 $ ] dex ( fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating a thin disc sample .",
    "hence , we preferred to use the whole sample in the calibration of @xmath3 absolute magnitude to @xmath4 colour instead of separating it into different metallicity classes . the distribution of 80 per cent of the points in fig .",
    "1 is almost circular , while the complete figure gives the indication of a linear distribution .",
    "also , the large scattering and the inhomogeneous number density hinder the selection of fitting type of the @xmath3 absolute magnitude in terms of @xmath4 colour .",
    "however , we considered all the points and fitted @xmath3 to a linear equation in terms of @xmath4 as in the following ( fig .",

    "if we transform this value to the colour excess @xmath55 by the equation @xmath56 @xcite , and use it in eq .",
    "( 4 ) we get an absolute magnitude fainter than 0.02 mag .",
    "the mean absolute magnitude residuals and the corresponding standard deviations for two sets are given in the third and fourth rows of table 2 .",
    "the mean of the absolute magnitude residuals evaluated by adopting the constant absolute magnitude value @xmath6 mag , @xmath57@xmath50.053 , is 53 times larger than the one evaluated by the linear equation , @xmath57@xmath50.001 , in our work .",
    "also , the standard deviation corresponding to the linear equation is smaller than the other one .",
    "however , the factor of the residuals in fig .",
    "4 is slightly higher than unity .",
    "we applied the procedure to the data in @xcite .",

    "we replaced the recent parallaxes and @xmath0 band magnitudes appeared in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue with the old ones .",
    "the relative parallax errors lie in the interval @xmath58 and their median is 0.02 .",
    "we used the following equation of @xcite to correct the observed _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite : @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the observed and corrected parallaxes , respectively , and @xmath62 denotes the error of the observed parallax . @xmath63",

    "the total number of stars for which @xmath3 absolute magnitudes could be estimated is 282 .",
    "we plotted the @xmath3 absolute magnitudes versus @xmath4 colours for these stars in fig .",
