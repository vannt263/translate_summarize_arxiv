    "this article provides a unified approach , based on the jacobi fields , to study open sets of 3-period orbits in billiards on manifolds with constant curvature .",
    "specifically , we consider spherical and hyperbolic cases . while the spherical as well as euclidean case has been treated previously , our result for the billiards on hyperbolic plane is a new one .",
    "billiards on manifolds of constant curvature have been studied earlier in @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "billiard domains on the sphere , containing open sets of periodic orbits , have been constructed . in @xcite and in this article , the main goal is to assure that except for those special cases , 3-period orbits have zero measure .",
    "the billiard system on a two dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath0 consists of the domain @xmath1 with a piecewise smooth boundary @xmath2 and a mass point moving along the geodesics inside the domain .",
    "whenever the mass hits the boundary , it reflects according to fermat s principle so as to extremize the path length .",
    "that leads to the familiar law : the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection .",
    "periodic orbits are a natural object of study in dynamical systems . one important question concerns the presence of large sets , in particular sets of positive measure , of periodic orbits in the billiard ball problem . informally speaking",
    ", measure corresponds to the probability that a given orbit is periodic .",
    "this question has been originally motivated by spectral geometry problems .",
    "the second term of the weyl asymptotics for the dirichlet problem in a bounded domain has a certain special form if periodic orbits of the associated billiard problem have zero measure @xcite , see also a survey article by gutkin @xcite .",
    "there is a natural invariant measure for the billiard map which can be defined as follows : let @xmath3 be an arclength parameter coordinatizing the boundary and let @xmath4 $ ] be the angle of the outcoming ray from the boundary measured in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "the billiard ball map @xmath5 \\rightarrow [ \\partial \\q\\times [ 0,\\pi]]$ ] which takes an outcoming ray to another one obtained after reflection from the boundary , preserves the measure @xmath6 , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "our motivation to study the structure of the set of periodic orbits in non - euclidean geometries is that this understanding may help one with the planar case for higher period orbits .",
    "it is also expected that eigenvalue asymptotics in non - euclidean geometries would also require understanding the structure of the sets of periodic orbits .    for the planar billiard problem ,",
    "it is easy to see that two period orbits have zero measure , since these orbits must be normal to the boundary at both ends .",
    "similarly , this is the case for a billiard on @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "a billiard on @xmath8 with boundary given by equator has two - period orbits of positive measure .",
    "this has to do with the presence of conjugated points on @xmath8 .    for the period 3 ,",
    "the problem on existence of positive measure sets is already non - trivial .",
    "the first result on zero measure of 3-period orbits in planar billiards was obtained by rychlik , see @xcite , relying on symbolic calculations , which were later removed in @xcite . using jacobi fields",
    ", wojtkovski gave an elegant simple proof of rychlik s theorem .",
    "subsequently , there have been extensions to other types of billiard systems : higher dimensional ( @xcite ) , outer billiards ( @xcite ) , and spherical ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a proof for the period 4 case has been announced by glutsyuk and kudryashov @xcite .",
    "our main result is    [ theo : main ] the set of 3-period orbits in any billiard on @xmath7 has zero measure .    in order to prove this theorem , we extend the jacobi fields approach from @xcite and present the unified proof which treats all three billiard systems on the constant curvature manifolds in the same manner .",
    "our argument proceeds independently of the underlying geometry until we get the compatibility condition .",
    "then , using the relevant cosine formula , which depends on the geometry , we obtain the relation that must be satisfied on a neighborhood filled with 3-period orbits @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the length of 3-period orbits , @xmath11 is geodesic curvature at one of the vertices , @xmath12 is the angle of the billiard orbit with the tangent to the boundary at this vertex and @xmath13 is the value of the arclength parameter @xmath3 at the vertex .",
    "the function @xmath14 depends on the underlying riemannian manifold @xmath15    from this formula it is possible to classify sets of 3-period orbits .",
    "in particular , we obtain a new proof of a theorem by baryshnikov on the spherical case @xcite where sub - riemannian geometry methods were used .",
    "[ theo : sphere ] let @xmath16 be the set of 3-period orbits in the billiard domain @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",
    "assume that some orbit @xmath19 has perimeter @xmath20 or @xmath21 and that some arcs of @xmath17 containing @xmath22 belong to great circles .",
    "then @xmath23 and @xmath16 has positive measure .",
    "otherwise , @xmath24 . in particular , if none of 3-period orbits are of the above special type , then @xmath16 has an empty interior and is the set of zero measure .",
    "we only prove that the set of 3-period orbits on @xmath25 ( and on @xmath18 when the special condition is not satisfied ) has an empty interior .",
    "the stronger statement about zero measure follows verbatim the argument in @xcite , page 163 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a smooth domain on a surface of constant curvature @xmath27 .",
    "the billiard ball inside @xmath26 travels along the geodesics and reflects at the boundary .",
    "let @xmath28 be a one - parameter family of geodesics where @xmath29 .    for the reader s convenience",
    ", we briefly recall the derivation of the jacobi fields , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the jacobi field is defined by @xmath30 and it satisfies the jacobi equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the covariant derivative and @xmath33 is the curvature tensor . as usual , we are interested in the component of the jacobi field , that is perpendicular to @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , it can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a scalar function and @xmath37 is a unit vector field perpendicular to @xmath38 .",
    "if the surface has constant curvature @xmath27 , then one obtains a scalar equation with constant coefficients @xmath39 according to the standard result in the theory of differential equations , the solution of the jacobi equation is uniquely defined if two initial conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given .",
    "consider billiards on the hyperbolic plane @xmath42 and the 2-sphere @xmath8 which have the curvature @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "solving the jacobi equation ( [ eq : jcb ] ) , we obtain @xmath45    in each case , we obtain the evolution matrix @xmath46 @xmath47    @xmath48    which describes the changes of the jacobi field over time .",
    "note that the corresponding evolution matrix in the euclidean case is given by @xmath49    when the billiard ball hits the boundary at @xmath50 , the jacobi field is transformed by the linear map @xmath51 which is essentially the same as the reflection map in the euclidean case @xmath52 @xmath53 note that the reflection matrix is directly related to the classical mirror formula , see @xcite .",
    "one should expect that the reflection matrix @xmath51 for the billiard on a two dimensional riemannian manifold should have the same form as in the euclidean case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we provide some justification .",
    "consider a one - parameter family of geodesics @xmath54 reflecting from the billiard boundary @xmath17 on a two dimensional riemannian manifold . in an @xmath55-neighborhood of the reflection point @xmath56 of @xmath57",
    ", the manifold can be represented as a smooth two dimensional surface in @xmath58 .",
    "projecting the geodesics and the boundary onto the tangent plane at @xmath56 , we obtain the corresponding structure on the plane : a family of orbits reflecting from the boundary .",
    "it is easy to estimate that the angles as well as distances before and after the projection , differ by @xmath59 .",
    "this is mainly due to the expansion @xmath60 . also , straightforward estimates show that the projected boundary curve will have the curvature equal to the geodesic curvature of @xmath17 with the accuracy @xmath59 . as quadratic terms",
    "do not affect linear transformations , the reflection map will have the same form as in the euclidean case with @xmath61 replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ theo : main ] .",
    "assume that there is an open set of 3-period orbits .",
    "then we must have @xmath63 and @xmath64 equal to the identity , which implies @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the identity map , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the collision points , and @xmath69 , are the distances between collision points , see figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this relation can be also rewritten as @xmath70 which takes the form @xmath71",
    "@xmath72    after simplification , we equate the top right components to get , which was derived in @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath73 we define @xmath74 to be the interior angle between two adjacent segments of an orbit , that is , @xmath75 , .",
    "then we alter the hyperbolic cosine formula into @xmath76 we use the half angle formula to get @xmath77 combining ( [ eq : step1 ] ) and ( [ eq : step2 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath78    note that the length of an orbit @xmath79 is invariant",
    ". therefore , @xmath80    this relation must hold for all nearby orbits .",
    "in particular , for all orbits starting at the same point on the boundary with different angles of reflection .",
    "thus , we obtain a contradiction because the right - hand side of the equation is not constant in any interval .",
    "therefore , the set of 3-period orbits has an empty interior .",
    "next , following an argument in @xcite we obtain that the set has zero measure , which ends the proof of the theorem [ theo : main ] .",
    "now we prove theorem [ theo : sphere ] using the same method .",
    "assuming there is an open set of 3-period orbits on @xmath8 , we again obtain that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are equal to the identity .",
    "therefore , using again @xmath81 we get @xmath82 note that this relation is the same as if trigonometric functions are replaced with their hyperbolic counterparts .",
    "combining ( [ eq : step3 ] ) and the modified version of spherical cosine formula , we arrive at @xmath83    if @xmath84 , then we have the same contradiction as in the hyperbolic case . when @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in this case",
    ", there could exist open sets of 3-period orbits .",
    "now , we discuss the characteristics of the billiards on which open sets of 3-period orbits exist .",
    "note that only orbits without repetition are considered , and this assumption limits our cases to @xmath88 , or @xmath21 , see also @xcite .    consider a spherical triangle @xmath22 on the unit sphere with perimeter @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the great circles passing through the vertices orthogonal to the corresponding bisectors .",
    "then , these great circles intersect at the right angles and any billiard boundary containing segments of @xmath89 passing through @xmath22 will have an open set of 3-period orbits .",
    "let @xmath90 be a geodesic on @xmath8 and @xmath56 be any point on @xmath90 .",
    "create two geodesics , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , that are perpendicular to @xmath90 and to each other , but do not pass through @xmath56 . consider any geodesic segment , @xmath93 , of length @xmath94 , whose endpoint is @xmath56 .",
    "denote the angle between @xmath93 and @xmath90 as @xmath95 . through two reflections over @xmath91 and @xmath92 , this line @xmath93 forms a triangle of length @xmath94 within the boundary created by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath56 and @xmath95 were arbitrary , any 3-period orbit of length @xmath94 must be contained in one octant , which is formed by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , whose intersections are orthogonal . in particular",
    ", this implies that all orbits in the octant are 3-periodic except those which hit the corners .",
    "+ consider three great circles that intersect at @xmath56 , @xmath96 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the total length of the lines is @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that an orbit of length @xmath21 is the complement of @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that an orbit of length @xmath21 must have vertices on @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 as in the @xmath94 case .",
    "+ now we consider a 3-period orbit of length @xmath99 .",
    "since it is impossible to create an orbit where @xmath100 , we look at the two other possible cases ; when @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 . in case 1 ,",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , we know that @xmath105 has perimeter @xmath94 and that @xmath68 is antipodal to @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 lies on @xmath92 .",
    "note that case 2 is simply the complement of case 1 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a 3-period orbit of length @xmath99 also has vertices on @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .     and @xmath107.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the last proposition completely classifies the special cases when open sets of 3-period orbits occur .",
    "if a given 3-period orbit has perimeter @xmath108 then the relation implies that this orbit has an empty interior in @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath109 or @xmath21 but for some vertex @xmath110 the geodesic curvature @xmath111 does not vanish identically on any open boundary arc containing @xmath110 , then again leads to the same contradiction .    finally applying the argument in @xcite , we obtain that if the special cases do not occur the set of 3-period orbits has zero measure .",
    "this ends the proof of theorem [ theo : sphere ] .",
