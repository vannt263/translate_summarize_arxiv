    "1995 ) . that emission covers from a few kev till several hundred kev . at very high energies , in the hundred mev till tev range blazars seem to be responsible for the observed fluxes ( zdziarski 1996 ; sreekumar et al . 1998 ) .",

    "however , at just that energy range 15 mev agns and blazars were known not to emit particularly strongly . since those first empirical results came out , it became relevant to identify the astrophysical sources adding in that energy interval to the diffuse extragalactic background because in the lack of astrophysically ordinary contributions to that emission , other more exotic considerations would be raised -i.e .",
    "for some dark matter candidates annihilation with other particles or decay might occur and give a significant integrated signal in the gamma  ray domain ( see , for instance , kamionkowski 1995 ; ellis 2000 ) . some of the theoretical candidates to explain that mev emission were already proposed , but the final comparison with the data had to wait till the reanalisis of the apollo data and the measurements done by heao - a4 ( kinzer et al .",
    "1997 ) , the solar maximum mission ( watanabe et al . 1999a ) , and more recently the availability of the diffuse @xmath0ray background measurements by comptel ( kappadath et al . 1996 ; weidenspointer 2000 ) .",
    "the measurement of the extragalactic @xmath0ray background in its present stage has , therefore , taken a great deal of training in the understanding of the response of the instruments on board of the different observatories .",
    "the analysis of heao ",
    "a4 , smm and comptel data has just released a consistent picture where the slope of the emission in the hard x - ray domain decreases with increasing energy from a few hundred kev range and meets a softer shape at about 10 mev implying smaller fluxes than suggested by the early data , but revealing the need of an intense extragalactic source in that mev window .",
    "already , in the late sixties , clayton & silk ( 1969 ) had suggested that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) would give rise to a diffuse @xmath0ray background in the mev range .",
    "the level of that background emission is discusssed in various works ( the et al .",

    "does not emit strongly enough in the mev regime ( mcnaron  brown et al .",

    "( 1998 ) reveals significant dust enshrouded star formation at high z. the star formation rate density over the range 2 @xmath8 z @xmath8 4 would be at least five times higher than that inferred from the uv emission of the hdf galaxies .",

    "( 1998 ) reconstruct the star formation histories compatible with the observations at various wavelengths incorporating the scuba results and the derivations from chemical evolution at high z. some of the compatible star formation histories peak at a z closer to 2 ( rather than 1 or 1.5 ) .",

    "is being buildt up for a peak at z @xmath4 11.5 ( madau et al .",

    "it has been pointed out against a peak in the star formation at z @xmath4 2 ( hughes et al . 1998 ) , that the submillimeter results have the advantage of unveiling star formation enshrouded by dust , but they suffer from the lack of real redshift identification of the observed emission .",
    "further evidence on star formation pointing to a larger star formation rate at high z than that inferred from uv  optical observations comes from measurements of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) by iso ( rowan  robinson et al . 1997 ; flores et al . 1998 ; elbaz et al . 1999 ) and the firas and dirbe experiments on board of cobe ( dwek et al . 1998 ; fixsen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the cobe results suggest at least a sfr twice as high at z @xmath4 1 than that determined by madau et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "there are as well open issues on how the star formation history evolves between the local value and that at z close to 1",
    ". the @xmath0ray emission of astrophysical sources from z @xmath4 0 to z @xmath4 2 will be indeed more relevant than the emission at z beyond 2 for setting the absolute flux of the background observed .",
    "the strong dilution factor linked to the square of the distance and the cosmological factors 1+z entering in the flux observed at earth from sources at very high z , add up to make the emission at very high z irrelevant for our detection capabilities as compared with the flux at z lower than 2 .",
    "most of the @xmath0ray photons received should come from supernovae that explode at z @xmath9 1.5 .",
    "their progeniitor systems were formed , however , at a much larger z. this makes relevant as well for the calculations the level of the sfr at z @xmath7 2 .",
    "determination of how much flux is received from sneia is grounded here in observations . in the next paragraph , we address the efficiency of sneia production in relation to the star formation rate determinations from the local universe to z@xmath4 1 .",
    "in parallel to the studies of star formation at high z , the research on how many sne ia result from star formation activity at high z has now made a step forward . since the first supernova measurement at high z by the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) ( pain et al . 1996 ) , searches of sne ia centered at various z have provided the evolution of that rate up to z @xmath4 0.55 ( hamuy & pinto 1999 ; hardin et al . 1998 ; pain et al . 1999 ) .",
    "results are summarized in table 1 .    as it has been pointed out ( ruiz  lapuente , burkert & canal 1995 , 1997 ; madau , della vella & panagia 1998 ; sadat et al .",
    "1998 ; dahlen & fransson 1998 ; yungelson & livio 1998 , 1999 ) , the better knowledge of the sne ia rates at all redshifts allow us to identify the stellar systems leading to type ia explosions .    here",
    "we combine the knowledge of the sne ia rates at all redshifts with that of the average star formation rate ( discussed in the previous section ) in order to investigate whether the efficiency in producing type ia sne has changed along cosmic time .",
    "such numbers , when compared with theoretical predictions , not only shed light on the supernova progenitor issue but allow us to give a clear answer on the level of the cosmic @xmath0-ray background provided by supernovae of type ia .    a very useful quantity to introduce",
    "is the `` efficiency '' in producing sne ia out of star formation , defined as the rate of sne ia at a given z per comoving volume ( sn yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 ) divided by the star formation rate at the same z ( in m@xmath10 yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "this value is independent of the cosmology assumed and refers to the number of sne ia per unit mass that has gone into star formation .",
    "@xmath11    any change in this efficiency for producing sne ia tells us about the timescale of the explosion as well as about the evolutionary effects in the production of type ia supernovae .",
    "the effect of the delay between star formation and explosion is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "a short timescale of the order to @xmath4 10@xmath12 yr gives rise to a constant `` efficiency '' along z , whereas a timescale of a few 10@xmath13 yr produces an accumulation of events towards low z. suggested metallicity effects reducing the number of type ia explosions at z @xmath7 1 ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1998 ) would also be reflected in the efficiency mentioned above by a drop in that quantity .",
    "little direct evidence is so far available on the nature of the binary system which is responsible for type ia sn explosions .",
    "we know that the exploding star is a carbon  oxygen white dwarf ( c+o wd ) and that there is no compact object left by the explosion .",
    "stellar evolution arguments tell us as well that those explosions take place in binary systems .",
    "but so far , it has not been possible to point clearly to a unique type of binary system as responsible for the type ia phenomenon ( ruiz  lapuente , canal & isern 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "two candidate systems seem favored .",
    "one of them is a pair of c+o wds in a binary system that merge as their orbit shrinks due to the emission of gravitational wave radiation ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "this system is refered as to _",
    "double degenerate system_. the other one is a wd which accretes material from a roche  lobe overfilling non - wd companion ( wd plus roche  lobe filling subgiant or giant ) .",
    "the system looks as an algol - type binary .",
    "it contains only a wd and therefore is a _ single  degenerate system _ ( whelan & iben 1973 ; branch et al .",
    "1995 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1995 ; ruiz  lapuente , canal & burkert 1995,1997 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1995 ; li & van den heuvel 1997 ; yungelson & livio 1998 ) .",
    "the peak or characteristic time of those explosions is different : merging of wds happens typically a few times 10@xmath14 yrs after star formation whereas the accretion of material from a non - wd companion involves less massive companions which take longer to leave the main sequence to become subgiants and giants .",
    "this second evolutionary path to sne ia takes about a few times 10@xmath15 yrs .",
    "therefore , there should be a reservoir for sne ia in those stars that evolve through a few gyrs in cosmic time until they explode . the overall expected number of sne ia as related to star formation gives also an idea on the proportion of binaries that end up as type ia supernovae .",
    "another factor entering in the evolution with z of the efficiency of type ia supernovae is the role that metallicity plays in enhancing or supressing the production of type ia supernovae from their parent stars .",
    "if metallicity effects do not play any important role in sne ia , the number of sne ia per unit mass in forming stars should remain insensitive to the progressive enhancement in metals of the interstellar medium along cosmic history .",
    "however , in the algol  type scenario , it has been suggested that metallicity plays an important role as the material transfered onto the wd forms a strong wind close to the wd surface which prevents the accretion rates from becoming very large ( hachisu , kato & nomoto 1996 ) .",
    "the role of this wind is claimed to be very sensitive to metallicity , and calculations predict that the number of sneia at low metallicity ( z @xmath7 1 ) should drastically decrease ( hachisu , kato & nomoto 1996 ) .",
    "a drop at z @xmath7 1 would thus confirm the metallicity effects suggested by hachisu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "an important question is whether the efficiency in producing sne ia has changed along cosmic time .",
    "results from several low  z type ia supernova searches and low ",
    "z star formation rate measurements do allow to address this issue .",
    "gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated the local star formation rate from h@xmath16 emission galaxies .",
    "the value derived from their search is @xmath17 @xmath18 h@xmath19 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "more recently , several authors have found values at least twice as large than the previous estimate for the local star formation rate ( gronwall 1999 ; tresse & maddox 1998 ; serjeant et al .",
    "treyer et al . (",
    "1998 ) from a uv - selected galaxy redshift survey find a local dust  corrected star formation rate of 4.3  @xmath20 m@xmath21 h@xmath19 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "if we take the rate obtained by hamuy & pinto ( 1999 ) from sne ia in the calan / tololo survey ( sne ia @xmath4 2.2 10@xmath22 sne ia yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 ) , and divide it by the local star formation rate , we obtain a local efficiency of sne ia out of star forming mass of about 1.09 10@xmath3 m@xmath23 .",
    "the efficiency seems to be similar up to z @xmath4 0.55 , if we take the rates by pain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "possibly such high efficiency extends up to z @xmath4 1 , since aldering , knop and nugent ( 1999 ) anounce a similar rate of sneia per comoving volume at z @xmath4 1 .",
    "an efficiency of sne ia out of star forming mass of @xmath24 , as derived taking into account rates measurements at various z ( see ruiz ",
    "lapuente & canal 2000 ) , means that less than 1000 m@xmath21 going into star formation give 1 type ia supernova ( 720 @xmath25 250 m@xmath21 give 1 snia ) .",
    "there is a delay between star formation and supernova explosion that makes this estimate move up or down according to the timescale and star formation history . but most star formation histories would average out the effect since the time distribution of sne ia is broad .",
    "thus , the above number derived from observations is physically meaningful .",
    "we can work out the efficiency of type ii sne explosions and compare it with the previous result .",
    "assuming that all stars with m @xmath26 10 m@xmath21 do produce gravitational collapse supernovae , and the salpeter imf , there is one gravitational collapse supernova per 135 m@xmath21 in forming stars , and thus the proportion of sne ia to sn ii / ibc supernovae is roughly one to five .",
    "the above ratio of type ia over type ii sne is basically in agreement with chemical evolution arguments ( timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) . at z @xmath4",
    "0 one expects an increase of the efficiency for the two main candidates to sne ia as a result of their explosion timescale ( significant formation of sne ia progenitor systems occurred at high  z and they only exploded now ) .",
    "the trend 3.5 type ii / ib to 1 type ia in the local sample of spiral galaxies ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1997 ) would be in agreement with those expectations . as it is argued in ruiz ",
    "lapuente @xmath27 canal ( 2000 ) , the high efficiency in producing type ia supernova explosions out of star formation favors the single  degenerate scenario for type ia supernovae .",
    "before integrating along cosmic time all the @xmath0ray contribution from sne ia , we must examine the evolution of the emission with time as the supernova ejecta expand and become optically thin . whereas the optical luminosity of supernovae peaks within three weeks after explosion , the @xmath0ray emission achieves a maximum around two and a half months after explosion for type ia sne and several months later for type ii / ibc sne .",
    "the exact moment of the peak depends on the kinetic energy , total mass of the supernova envelope and distribution of the radioactive material . as the compton scattering optical depth of the ejecta decreases due to the thining out of the material , the @xmath0ray spectra of type ia and type ii / ibc sne start to show more prominent lines and less continuum emission .",
    "the lines reveal the fractions of radioactive isotopes along with their mean half life .",
    "the radioactivity of sne ia is provided mostly by the decay @xmath28 , which gives rise to @xmath0ray photons in several lines and positron emission .",
    "the strongest lines of @xmath29 decay are at 0.847 and 1.238 mev followed in strength by the lines at 2.599 and 1.771 mev and others ( browne et al . 1978 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 decay has its strongest lines at 158 and 812 kev . as this isotope , @xmath31ni , has a shorter mean half life ( 6.1 days ) than its product decay @xmath31co ( 78.8 days ) , the latter is responsible for the sne radioactivity through most of the sn life , i.e. , its comptonized lines give rise to the continuum emission for a few years .",
    "@xmath32co ( a less abundant product of the explosive nucleosynthesis ) has a mean half life of 271 days , and its emission is relevant for type ii sne as it powers the bolometric light curve of those sne for years .    when surveying the gamma ",
    "ray sky and integrating to obtain the diffuse emission , we detect the emission from supernovae in various phases , including those corresponding to the time when supernovae have already faded away in the optical . at a given moment , we see in the @xmath0ray domain , from every volume of the sky , the sne ia that were exploding at the epoch corresponding to the redshift of that volume , and also those that exploded in that same volume up to almost two years before . we add up the emission of the supernovae at different phases .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath0ray spectra in this work is done through monte carlo computations following the @xmath0-ray emission arising in different regions of the supernova envelope .",
    "the numerical algorithm includes as main matter ",
    "radiation interaction processes compton scattering , pair production and photoelectric effect .",
    "the formation of positronium and its two and three photon decay is included as well .",
    "monte carlo calculations of a similar kind were done for fast deflagration models ( ruiz  lapuente et al .",
    "1993 ) and for the deflagration model w7 by nomoto , thielemann & yokoi ( 1984 ) .",
    "results on this standard type ia supernova model were compared with calculations by burrows & the ( 1990 ) and shigeyama et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , giving agreement among the predictions .",
    "sne ia , since they synthesize most of the @xmath33ni in the universe , are the most important contributors to the @xmath0ray background .",
    "sn ii and sn ibc contribute in a lesser extent because of their lower proportion of radioactive nuclei of medium range lifetime and their larger ejected mass and smaller expansion velocities .",
    "type ii sne and type ibc sne produce a much more comptonized @xmath0ray spectrum .",
    "they give rise to emission shifted to the hard x  ray domain .",
    "it is already known that type ia supernovae show a degree of diversity in the amount of @xmath33ni synthesized in the explosion ( ruiz  lapuente & filippenko 1992 ; ruiz  lapuente & lucy 1992 ) .",
    "the spread in brightness at maximum of those sne ia is linked to the @xmath33ni mass as well as to the effect of the opacity of the supernovae envelope ( arnett 1999 ; pinto & eastman 2000 ) .",
    "the distribution of type ia supernovae is centered , however , in `` normal '' events with a frequency of about 8367 @xmath34 according to local studies ( branch , fisher & nugent 1993 ; li et al .",
    "2000 ) . those are well reproduced by the explosion of a c+o wd which synthesizes about 0.6 m@xmath21 of @xmath33ni .",
    "the deflagration explosion model w7 by nomoto , thielemann & yokoi ( 1984 ) , that yields that amount of radioactive ni , has the characteristics in velocity structure , and element distribution that reproduces well the prototype sneia .",
    "therefore , we use that model to compute the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "recently , some support for deflagration explosion models has come from 3d hydrodynamic calculations of sne ia explosions which favor such burning mode against detonations and pulsated delayed detonations ( reinecke , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath0ray emission of the modeled snia ( model w7 ) resulting of an integration of the spectrum over 600 days ( a longer integration would not add up significantly to the total emitted flux ) can be seen in figure 3 ( see as well figure 4 ) .",
    "the result of integrating over 600 days the spectrum of a type ii / ibc collapse supernova can be seen for comparison in figure 4 .",
    "the model used for the type ii supernova is a type ii core collapse that produced 0.175 m@xmath21 of @xmath33ni and ejected an envelope of 14 m@xmath21 ( eastman 1998 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the relative contribution of sne ii and sne ia .",
    "in all the figures on @xmath0ray background calculations compared with observations , we have included the diffuse @xmath0ray background produced by both sn types .",
    "we found , however , the sn ii contribution to be negligible in the mev range as compared with that provided by sne ia explosions .",
    "the corresponding type ii sne rates as compared to type ia sne rates are shown in figure 6 .",
    "we have computed as well the integrated emission for a type ia supernova coming from a faster deflagration of a c+o wd ( ruiz  lapuente et al .",
    "the explosion synthesizes a larger amount of @xmath33ni .",
    "the flux level would be higher than for model w7 at a 10 @xmath34 level .",
    "the early emission would reveal stronger @xmath33ni lines and a higher flux in the kev range than model w7 .",
    "this is an imprint of sne ia explosions with @xmath33ni extending close to the surface ( a mixed w7 or other model with a larger spread of the radioactive material over the supernova envelope would be stronger in the x  ray range as well ) .",
    "however , as overluminous sne ia are in the overall sample compensated by the existence of the population of underluminous sne ia with a similar proportion in rates ( li et al .",
    "2000 ) , and those subluminous sne ia give a lower @xmath0ray flux , the simplification of using just a model for `` normal '' type ia sne , on the overall , seems justified .",
    "in order to calculate the contribution of sneia to the @xmath0ray background spectrum in the mev range , we first compute standard sneia @xmath0ray emission spectra for different times , from explosion to almost complete extinction of the produced radioactivities ( about 2 years after explosion ) . as explained in the preceding paragraph , we compute the spectra from the widely used w7 model ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) ( see again figure 3 , where the fluxes correspond to a distance of 10 mpc ) . a time ",

    "both rates of sne ia per comoving volume and their corresponding integrated @xmath0ray background are displayed .",
    "the sne ia rates are calculated for the coalescence of wds , and for the algol  type scenario including metallicity effects ( hachisu et al . 1996 ; ruiz  lapuente & canal 1998 ) . due to the good agreement of the efficiency of sne ia out of star formation on the later scenario , this is the one used for the extragalactic @xmath0ray background .",
    "some sfr fall short both to explain the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background and the cosmic sne ia rate ( figures 8 and 9 ) , and other clearly exceed the level of sne ia contribution as compared with the optical rates and the @xmath0ray data . among those overexceeding sfrs",
    "we show a sharply peaked star formation rate compatible , according to blain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , with all submillimeter and far  infrared data ( gaussian peaked sfr referreed here to as blain98b in figure 1 ) , having a maximum at z@xmath4 2 .",
    "it clearly overproduces cosmic @xmath0ray background as compared with the observations ( figure 10 ) , and at the same time it predicts very high sne ia rates . on the other side , the early madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) sfr falls short ( as already discussed ) and gives too low an increase of sne ia between the local and the high - z values .",
    "the same occurs with a model of sfr peaking at z @xmath4 2 compatible with the scuba results ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) , as can be seen in figure 9 .",
    "other models compatible with the scuba results showing a sfr roughly constant after z @xmath4 1 ( model blain98 in figure 1 ) give results compatible with the smm and comptel observations ( figure 11 ) their associated sne ia rates nicely fall into the observed rates of sne ia measured at z @xmath4 0.4 and 0.55 ( pain et al . 1996 ; 1999 ) .",
    "the sfrs derived from the star formation history of lyman break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) and the one from iso ( dwek et al . 1998 ) go in the same sense for the predictions of rates and @xmath0ray background as the model by blain et al .",
    "however , a slight increase of the absolute level of the sf would provide a better agreement with the observations ( figures 12 and 13 ) .",
    "the sfr compatible with the ebl as detected through cobe also gives a reasonable fit to the data ( figure 14 ) .",
    "two cosmologies have been used when integrating the @xmath0ray background : an open universe with @xmath58=0.3 , and a flat universe with @xmath58=0.3 and @xmath59=0.7 .",
    "both the integrated @xmath0ray background and the sne ia counts at z @xmath4 1 are larger in a @xmath60dominated universe .",
    "the counts are , however , much more sensitive to the cosmological model ( see ruiz  lapuente & canal 1998 ) .      the role of dust obscuring type ia sn at high  z can also be tested by comparing the extragalactic @xmath0ray background expected from sne ia and the observed sne ia counts at high z.    if dust plays a very important role obscuring type ia supernovae up to z @xmath4 1 and leading us to miss their detection , we should see a discrepancy between the derived results from the optical searches and the level of the @xmath0ray flux .",
    "the @xmath0ray background , which is not disturbed by dust absorption , clearly points out that we can not have a much higher rate of sne ia than what we are observing optically .",
    "the reason is that with a much larger rate the @xmath0ray background from those sne ia would exceed the fluxes measured by smm and comptel ( see figures 814 )",
    ". it might however be the case that future sn searches at z@xmath72 with ngst would reveal significant obscuration in the sn counts , more significant at those z than below 1.5 .",
    "it looks as if the dust , being present at those z , would redden the supernovae by a magnitude increment which does not affect significantly the efficiency of the optical searches .    in order to quantify this effect ,",
    "we have estimated the extinction by dust on the observed sneia counts . to that purpose",
    "we adopt the model of pei , fall , & hauser ( 1999 ) and take their redshift distributions of gas density @xmath61 and of metallicity @xmath62 . from that , we compute the dust distribution @xmath63 adopting a mean dust  to  metals ratio @xmath64 . the dust extinction and absorption coefficients , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as functions of wavelength @xmath67 , are those for lmc grains ( draine & lee 1984 ; pei 1992 ) , and the characteristic optical depth of absorbers @xmath68 , and the characteristic optical depth of small  scale dust clumps @xmath69 , are computed accordingly",
    "once those optical depths are obtained , we estimate the mean fraction of photons absorbed by dust @xmath70 , calculate the extinction for the central wavelength of the @xmath71band ( 5500  ) as a function of @xmath38 , and translate it into a magnitude increase @xmath72 .    to obtain an estimate of the effect on counts",
    ", we have computed the cumulative sneia counts ( sneia per yr and per sq.deg . ) as a function of limiting magnitude @xmath73 as in ruiz  lapuente & canal ( 1998 ) .",
    "comparison of the expected counts with and without dust extinction is shown in figure 15 .",
    "the dashed line shows the smaller counts resulting from the decrease in @xmath38 for a given @xmath73 when dust extinction is taken into account .",
    "the effect is rather small and only noticeable for @xmath74 .",
    "that reflects the double dependence of @xmath75 on metallicity @xmath76 and on gas fraction @xmath61 . at smaller @xmath73 ( lower @xmath38 ) ,",
    "metallicity is high but there is little gas and thus @xmath75 ( proportional to @xmath61 ) is small . at larger @xmath73 ( higher @xmath38 )",
    ", there is more gas but then @xmath76 is low , which also results in small @xmath75 .",
    "the overall effect in a magnitude limiting sne ia search is that the fraction of sne ia missed due to dust obscuration in their host galaxies will not exceed a 5@xmath34 in the redshift range ( till z @xmath4 1 - 1.5 ) relevant for this work .",
    "this might explain the extraordinary consistency between optical and @xmath0ray results .      unlike the other candidate sources proposed to explain the @xmath0ray background in the mev range i.e .",
    "mev blazars , seyfert with mev nonthermal tails- , type ia supernovae have an evolution of rate with z that has been measured ( table i ) . knowing the sne ia rate at various z we only need to trust our expectations for the spectra in the @xmath0ray domain to be able to firmly establish our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0ray predictions from models do not raise major questions concerning the physics needed to be included to calculate the spectra .",
    "that is basically the same physics needed to explain type ii sne @xmath0ray emission , where the comparison with the @xmath0ray observations of sn 1987a proved successful ( sunyaev et al .",
    "1988 ; cass & lehoucq 1994 ; nomoto et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the snia explosion models have , in addition , been tested and compared with optical spectra .",
    "while detection of individual sne ia in the @xmath0ray domain has to await the launch of integral and would only be possible in a certain extragalactic distance range ( kumagai & nomoto 1997 ; isern et al .",
    "1999 ) , here we outline the already available detection of sne ia in the form of their observed mev background .",
    "support for the identification of the underlying radioactivity responsible for the optical light curves in sne ia comes from accurate tests .",
    "the amount of radioactive material synthesized in a sne ia is confirmed , among others , by the observational calibration of the optical absolute luminosity of those explosions done by means of cepheids ( sandage et al .",
    "1998 ; gibson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "whereas it is worth exploring whether seyfert galaxies present a nonthermal tail in the mev range as that observed in `` microquasar '' sources , and the blazar emission at those energies should be investigated , we find that the shape and flux of the @xmath0ray background is at the level expected from type ia sne .",
    "the reconstruction of the distribution with z of sne ia events provides the basis for this assertion .",
    "we have shown how the sneia fit to the cosmic @xmath0ray background in the mev range probes the global star formation history up @xmath77 .",
    "it seemingly disfavors sfrs which rise only moderately from @xmath78 to @xmath77 having a maximum star formation value at that z below 0.2 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 . that has important implications for the overall cosmic chemical evolution , and particularly , for the history of metal enrichment as well as for destruction of fragile primordial nuclides , namely deuterium .",
    "cass et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss different galactic chemical evolution models and compare them with the data on the variation of the luminosity density , as a function of @xmath38 , in different wavelength bands ( uv , b , ir ) .",
    "they assume that the star formation history of our galaxy is representative of the average galaxy that contributes to the luminosity density at high @xmath38 , and they also find that , in order to fit the multi  color luminosity data for @xmath79 , sfrs rising sharply ( by factors @xmath80 ) along this redshift interval are required .",
    "spiral galaxies like our own should give a dominant contribution to the uv luminosity density up to @xmath77 ( marzke et al .",
    "1994 ; driver et al .",
    "1999 ) , and thus their star formation and chemical evolution histories should approximate well the global ones . as already pointed out above , dwek et al .",
    "( 1988 ) equally need high sfrs at high @xmath38 to reproduce the strong intergalactic ir background , and we have seen that their proposed @xmath81 gives a good fit to the cosmic @xmath0ray background .    concerning the global evolution of metallicity with @xmath38 , chemical evolution models typically predict a stronger evolution than that observed .",
    "this is the `` missing metals '' problem ( pagel 1998 ; see also pettini 1999 ) . damped lyman alpha systems , which were thought to be the progenitors of today s spirals ,",
    "do not show significant chemical evolution , but the most likely explanation is that ly@xmath16 systems trace a population different from the galaxies responsible for the bulk of star formation . at higher @xmath38 ,",
    "the metal contents of the ly@xmath16 forest , which may account for a large fraction of the baryons in the universe , is one order of magnitude too low , but the missing metals can be in hot gas in galactic halos and proto  clusters .",
    "the role of the metal enrichment by sne ia at high z is another unknown in those studies , and hardly constrained so far .",
    "the present combined results of the rate of sne ia at high z as observed in the optical and in the @xmath0ray background places constraints which are worth considering in models of cosmic chemical evolution .",
    "the role of sne ia generously enriching the universe in metals after z@xmath4 1 can now be quantified and compared with the observations .",
    "such a high enrichment should show up in a steep change of the abundance slope of metals produced in sne ia at z @xmath4 1 ( further discussion on this subject will be addressed in future work ) .    as to d ,",
    "the abundances inferred from high@xmath38 qso absorbers show a strongly bimodal distribution , one value being `` low '' ( @xmath82 : tytler et al . 2000 ) and the other `` high '' ( @xmath83 : webb et al .",
    "1999 ) . taken as the primordial values ,",
    "since d is only destroyed by astration in the course of galaxy evolution , the `` low '' value ( not much higher than the present one ) would mean little destruction and thus scarce astration , corresponding to a stellar formation activity that would only moderately increase with lookback time , as considered often in models for our galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath81 required to explain the cosmic @xmath0ray background as well as the observations mentioned in section 2 , would destroy primordial d by a large factor ( @xmath80 ) . overall consistency would thus require a `` high '' primordial d ( which means a low baryon to photon ratio : @xmath84 in the standard bbn , higher values being possible in non  standard bbn ) , followed by its massive destruction by astration down to the present low values ( vangioni  flam & cass 1995 ) .",
    "both the spectral shape and the level of the overall @xmath0ray flux escaping from type ia supernova explosions up to z@xmath4 1 match the measurements of the cosmic @xmath0-ray background obtained with smm and comptel in the window covering the hard  x ray range till 3 mev ( kappadath et al . 1996 ; watanabe et al . 1999b ) .",
    "the results have been checked against the empirical high - z sne ia rates obtained in searches designed for cosmological purposes .",
    "the analysis of the supernova rates both in the high  z and in the nearby universe allows us to depict the efficiency in producing sne ia .",
    "once the snia efficiency from star forming mass is known at various z , both the sne ia rates per comoving volume and the absolute level of the @xmath0ray background constrain the sfr at high z. in this work we have found that a range of sfr histories is compatible with these observations . the best results",
    "are obtained for sfr reaching a maximum value of 0.30.4 m@xmath21 yr@xmath2 mpc @xmath3 at z @xmath4 1.5 , and possibly keeping that value towards higher z ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "some of the reconstructed star formation histories compatible with the scuba measurements ( blain et al .",
    "1998 ) are among those favored by this analysis .",
    "the sfr derived from the uv emission density at high z in the hubble deep field by madau , pozzeti & dickinson ( 1998 ) seems a factor 2 too low to explain the sne ia counts and the comptel and smm background observations in the mev range .",
    "other sfrs peaking with a maximum of star formation 3 - 4 times larger than the above value can be excluded on account of the overexceeding @xmath0ray background .",
    "the sfr derived from cobe ( dwek et al .",
    "1998 ) gives results in background and rates compatible with the observations .",
    "beyond considerations on the sfr it is shown in this work that for a rate evolution of sne ia compatible with a number of empirical determinations in searches performed by the supernova cosmology project ( z @xmath85 0.3 ) , the eros sn search ( z @xmath4 0.1 ) , and others ( table 1 ) , we obtain a @xmath0ray background that explains the spectral shape and flux level measured by comptel and smm ( kappadath et al .",
    "1996 ; watanabe et al . 1999b ; weidenspointer 2000 ) .",
    "earlier suggestions of a too low contribution by supernovae in the mev range ( watanabe et al .",
    "1999b ) implied as well constrains on the delay time between formation and explosion of sne ia that are not substained in the present analysis .",
    "we found that while it is still early to constrain the timescale to explosion of sne ia , the efficiencies in producing sne ia supernovae out of star formation , as discussed here , provide a reliable basis for a @xmath0ray background calculation ( see ruiz - lapuente & canal 2000 for the physical constrains on the progenitors ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that a range of star formation histories compatible with current measurements ( scuba , cobe ) reproduce well both the sne ia rates and the @xmath0ray background .    in view of the presence of sources other than supernovae contributing to the background in the kev region and above 3 mev",
    ", a finer spectral study of this cosmic @xmath0ray emision appears compulsory .",
    "there are several interesting goals for future @xmath0ray missions in the mev range .",
    "higher spectral resolution and more precise flux determination in the measurement of the extragalactic mev background will be most important , since they will allow to check the consistency among cosmological model , history of star formation and type ia supernova efficiency which are being derived from the cosmological sne ia searches . as already noticed ( watanabe et al .",
    "1999b ) , the individual @xmath0ray lines when integrating the supernova emission along z add up to an observable pattern of step structure in the background spectrum .",
    "such pattern , unobserved in measurements up to the present achieved accuracy , should be detected when performing high precision measurements of the cosmic @xmath0ray background .",
    "another question which can not be answered with the data available at this point is the shape in the junction of the spectrum between the region where sne ia provide the emission and blazars remain the main emitters .",
    "next missions with coverage of the 3 - 10 mev region could be critical in providing the accurate measurements assesing the blazar contribution in this transition range .    back to longer wavelengths ,",
    "future sn searches using the ngst should provide measurements of rates of sne well beyond the critical peak at z@xmath4 11.5 ( madau 1998 ; dahlen & fransson 1998 ) . those would not only be used to test the cosmological model in the way done up to now through optical sn searches by the supernova cosmology project and the high  z team collaboration ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) , but they will provide as well additional tests on @xmath59 through the counts evolution with z ( ruiz  lapuente & canal 1998 ) , and will be able to answer a large number of questions related to the star formation history in the universe , its chemical evolution and the background light provided by its stellar explosions .",
    "prl thanks her colleagues of the supernova cosmology project , and specially r. pain , for exchanges on the observed high  z rates .",
    "the authors would like to thank as well r. eastman for providing his core  collapse models .",

    "<S> the calculations presented here show how type ia sn rates compatible with the results of optical supernova searches give a background emission in the mev range that can explain the extragalactic emission measured by comptel and smm . </S>",
    "<S> star formation histories reaching maximum values of 0.30.4 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 at z@xmath4 1.5 ( and/or possibly keeping that value to higher z ) give a @xmath0ray background compatible with observations while they also predict the observed supernova rates per comoving volume . </S>",
    "<S> while supernova rates are sensitive to the cosmology and details of star formation history along z , the @xmath0ray background in the mev range is very weakly dependent on the cosmology and compatible with a range of star formation histories . </S>",
    "<S> it is mostly sensitive to the star formation rate at z@xmath4 12 , but the activity in forming stars at even higher z has an influence as well on the absolute level of the cosmic @xmath0ray background : the time elapsed by the sne ia progenitors until they explode has a broad distribution and the rates of sne ia at z@xmath4 1.52 depend on the formation frequencies of their progenitor stars at earlier epochs . the mutual consistency of predictions of optical rates and integrated emission in the @xmath0ray domain place in a firm ground the type ia supernova identification as the astrophysical source responsible for this cosmic background . </S>"
