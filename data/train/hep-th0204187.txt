    "there are many faces of superstring / brane cosmology which come from different corners of m / string theories . in particular",
    ", people search for potential candidates to explain early universe inflation , present day dark energy and dark matter in the universe .",
    "one of the string theory constructions , tachyon on d - branes , has been recently proposed for cosmological applications by sen @xcite .",
    "a relatively simple formulation of the unstable d - brane tachyon dynamics in terms of effective field theory stimulates one to investigate its role in cosmology @xcite .",
    "the rolling tachyon in the string theory may be described in terms of effective field theory for the tachyon condensate @xmath4 , which in the flat spacetime has a lagrangian density @xmath5 the tachyon potential @xmath0 has a positive maximum at @xmath6 and a minimum at @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "we consider two models , with finite value of @xmath1 and with minimum at infinity , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : pot ] . in both cases",
    "one encounters interesting possibilities for cosmological applications .    in the case of finite @xmath1 , we consider quadratic expansion around the minimum of the potential @xmath7 .",
    "as we will show , in this case the tachyon matter has negative pressure and may be considered a candidate for quintessence .    in the case when @xmath8 , we use exponential asymptotic of the potential @xmath9 derived from the string theory calculations @xcite ( exact form of the potential from ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath10 ; our qualitative results for late time asymptotics of @xmath11 do not depend on the pre - exponential factor ) .",
    "dimensional parameters of the potential are related to the fundamental length scale , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the brane tension .",
    "as it was demonstrated by sen @xcite , the tachyon matter is pressureless for the potential with the ground state at infinity . in this case",
    "tachyon matter may be considered a cold dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the models of type ( [ lag ] ) already were studied in cosmology on the phenomenological ground . for certain choices of potentials @xmath14 and non - minimal kinetic terms one",
    "can get kinematically driven inflation , `` @xmath15-inflation '' @xcite .",
    "in particular , a toy model with the potential @xmath16 with ground state at infinity may give rise to the power law inflation of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , it remains to be seen how this potential can be motivated by the string theory of tachyon .",
    "the model with @xmath17 is reduced to the so - called `` chaplygin gas '' where the matter equation of state is @xmath18 .",
    "such matter was suggested as a candidate for the present dark energy @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the instant value of the ratio of energy density ( [ density ] ) and pressure ( [ pressure ] ) , @xmath19 , is oscillating with time , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : eos ] .",
    "although the amplitude of oscillations @xmath4 is decreasing with time , the amplitude of @xmath20 is not changing with time as it is clear from the figure  [ fig : eos ] .",
    "the period of oscillations is very small ( @xmath21 ) , so that only the average equation of state is important for cosmological evolution . to find it",
    ", we average @xmath22 over several consecutive oscillations .",
    "the average value of @xmath23 , shown as the horizontal line at the right panel of figure  [ fig : eos ] , is independent of time and equal to @xmath24 for this type of the equation of state , average value of the energy density dilutes as @xmath25 with the expansion of the universe .",
    "the amplitude of the tachyon oscillations is then decreasing as @xmath26 , which is compatible with numerical results . from ( [ friedman ] ) we find that the scale factor on average is @xmath27 .",
    "note that equation of state similar to ( [ eos ] ) takes place for a network of cosmic strings .",
    "equation of state ( [ eos ] ) for the quadratic tachyon potential can be easily derived analytically . indeed , assuming that tachyon is oscillating much faster than the universe expands , we can treat energy density @xmath28 as adiabatic invariant , and write @xmath29 , where @xmath28 is constant over several consecutive oscillations",
    ". then the average value of @xmath30 for quadratic potential is @xmath31 and so @xmath32 . if shape of the potential around the minimum is not quadratic , but a power - law @xmath33 , the average equation of state is @xmath34 .",
    "although tachyon matter in the model has negative pressure , apparently it is short of explaining present acceleration of the universe .",
    "combination of cosmological observations of cmb fluctuations , large scale structure clustering and high redshift supernovae constrains the equation of state to be lower than @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "as we will see in the next section , background tachyon dynamics in this model is unstable under small spatial fluctuations , and homogeneous tachyon oscillations will decay . it will be interesting to find what will be the final configuration of tachyon matter in this model and what may be its potential application to cosmology .",
    "it is expected that in realistic cosmological scenario tachyon field has small , quantum or classical , inhomogeneous fluctuations . in this section",
    ", we check the stability of tachyon fluctuations around the background solution discussed in the previous section . for the moment , let us ignore the expansion of the universe .",
    "then we only have to solve equation ( [ fluct1 ] ) to find behaviour of fluctuations .",
    "although formally some of the coefficients in equation ( [ fluct1 ] ) are singular when the background field @xmath11 crosses zero in the case of quadratic potential , it is possible to switch to regular variables and overcome this technical inconvenience . numerical solution of the fluctuation equation ( for example for @xmath36 in units of @xmath1 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : inst ] .",
    "general theory of linear equations with periodic coefficients predicts the presence of stability and instability bands of momenta @xmath15 . for unstable modes",
    ", the amplitude is increasing exponentially as @xmath37 .",
    "for the value of @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : inst ] the amplitude of fluctuations is increasing with time exponentially fast , by an order of magnitude in one background oscillation , say @xmath38 increases by a factor of @xmath39 in ten oscillations !",
    "the physical reason is amplification due to the parametric resonance .",
    "this can be clearly seen if one rewrites equation ( [ fluct1 ] ) in the form of the oscillator - like equation , where the effective frequency is oscillating with time .",
    "this effect can be described by the theory of broad parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "since period of oscillation ( @xmath21 ) is tiny compared to the cosmological time , and fluctuations become significant within several background oscillations , one can ignore expansion of the universe in this analysis .",
    "thus we conclude that in the model with quadratic potential small tachyon fluctuations are exponentially unstable and background tachyon condensate decays into inhomogeneous configuration .",
    "decay of background tachyon condensate into inhomogeneous fluctuations does not necessarily mean that the universe becomes inhomogeneous .",
    "the tachyon fluid remains homogeneous as a whole , but not as the coherent condensate .",
    "therefore it remains to be seen , based on the fully nonlinear analysis , what will be equation of state of the non - condensate tachyon fluid .",
    "in this section , we consider the model with the potential @xmath40 , with its ground state at infinity , as sketched in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pot ] .",
    "again , we can use dimensionless tachyon @xmath4 in units of @xmath1 and dimensionless time @xmath41 in the same units @xmath1 .",
    "background cosmological solutions of the equations ( [ time ] ) and ( [ friedman ] ) for this case very quickly ( several @xmath1 ) enters the regime where tachyon is rolling very fast , and @xmath42 approaches unity exponentially quickly @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the scale factor .",
    "the formula ( [ f1 ] ) applies , in particular , for radiation dominated stage where @xmath45 and tachyon does not contribute to gravity , and for @xmath46 where tachyon gravitationally dominates . without expansion of the universe , solution",
    "( [ f1 ] ) corresponds to that of sen @xcite .    in the above regime",
    ", tachyon potential is decreasing exponentially fast @xmath47 .",
    "remarkably , as it was discovered by sen @xcite , the energy density of tachyon matter is non - zero , while its pressure vanishes . in an expanding universe from ( [ density ] ) , ( [ pressure ] ) , ( [ f1 ] ) we have @xmath48 while pressure vanishes @xmath49 in dimensional units",
    "one can estimate @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , rolling tachyon matter in an expanding universe is pressureless , its energy density dilutes as @xmath51 , and its density may be tuned to the level of dark matter density of the universe .",
    "this makes tachyon matter with exponential potential a cosmological dark matter candidate .",
    "the crucial property of the cosmological dark matter without pressure is the growth of cosmological fluctuations , which form a developed large scale structure .",
    "the large scale structure of the universe is ranging from non - linear clustered halos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , quasi - linear structures at scales of supercluster and voids , and linear fluctuations at very large scales .",
    "it is essential that at quasi - linear and non - linear stages dark matter is displaced from the homogeneous distribution due to the flows generated by the fluctuations of gravitational potential , and gravitationally bound halos have high velocity dispersions .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate the clustering properties of the pressureless tachyon matter .",
    "we assume rolling tachyon matter domination and expansion rate of the universe is @xmath52 .",
    "we begin with linear analysis of cosmological fluctuations , using formalism of section  [ sec : fluc ] . for a moment , consider the case without expansion of the universe and without coupling to gravitational perturbations . from equation ( [ fluct1 ] ) for exponential potential it follows that the fluctuations are not growing , @xmath53 .",
    "now let us consider tachyon fluctuations including expansion of the universe and coupling to gravitational potential @xmath54 . substituting the background solution ( [ f1 ] ) for the pressureless tachyon matter into equations ( [ single ] )",
    ", one can see that the coefficient in the front of @xmath55 ( which plays the role of the sound speed for the tachyon matter ) vanishes exponentially fast .",
    "this means that the growth of linear tachyon fluctuations is scale free , similar to that of the standard cold dark matter scenario .",
    "then the solution of ( [ single ] ) is @xmath56 , and the left - hand side of equation ( [ mukh ] ) is constant . from this",
    "we immediately get the time evolution of fluctuations @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 linear metric fluctuations are constant , similar to that in the cold dark matter scenario . however , the fluctuations in the tachyon field are growing , @xmath60 , in contrast to the simplified analysis above , where we neglected coupling to the metric fluctuations and expansion of the universe .",
    "the growth of tachyon fluctuations @xmath61 can not be obtained without these ingredients .",
    "thus , tachyon fluctuations are unstable due to the effects of gravitational instability in an expanding universe .    however , the linear approximation for rolling tachyon / gravity system works only during very short time interval ( of order of tens of @xmath1 ) .",
    "indeed , let us inspect the energy density of tachyon matter in the model with exponential potential , not assuming it is homogeneous @xmath62 for fluctuations @xmath63 we have @xmath64 , where @xmath65 describes initial spatial profile of the fluctuations .",
    "the full tachyon field including fluctuations is @xmath66 .",
    "the numerator of expression ( [ density1 ] ) vanishes as @xmath67 , while the denominator evolves as @xmath68 .",
    "the linear approximation works during very short time interval while @xmath69 .",
    "when this inequality breaks , linear analysis becomes insufficient .",
    "for cosmological fluctuations @xmath70 , linear theory is valid during time interval of order of @xmath71 .",
    "recall that for the standard particle dark matter scenario linear stage lasts during significant fraction of cosmological expansion .",
    "one can try to use non - linear ansatz for the inhomogeneities of @xmath72 .",
    "non - vanishing energy density ( [ density1 ] ) for rolling tachyon with numerator @xmath73 is achievable if denominator is also vanishing as @xmath67 .",
    "denominator @xmath74 is not going to vanish unless we admit that @xmath75 decreases faster than @xmath76 .",
    "one of the working ansatz for inhomogeneous tachyon field is @xmath77 where @xmath78 weakly depends on @xmath41 .",
    "this solution gives energy density ( [ density1 ] ) which is only spatially dependent .",
    "solution for inhomogeneous tachyon was considered by sen @xcite .",
    "now we will argue that fast rolling tachyon condensate with vanishing @xmath79 and nonzero @xmath28 lacks nonvanishing gradients @xmath80 which correspond to cosmic velocity , or displacement of tachyon matter .",
    "indeed , energy - momentum tensor of tachyon condensate may be written in the hydrodynamic form @xmath81 where corresponding fluid velocity is @xmath82 energy density is given by ( [ density1 ] ) and pressure is @xmath83 .",
    "substituting here the solution ( [ anz ] ) , we find @xmath84 .",
    "thus , rolling tachyon condensate does not behave like a media of non - interacting particles .",
    "this is in contrast with the standard pressureless media of cold dark matter particles where large scale velocities and displacements of particles from their initial positions are growing with time .",
    "we considered cosmological solutions of rolling tachyon condensate @xmath4 for two models of tachyon potential @xmath0 .",
    "there are different levels at which one can theoreticize about @xmath11 in expanding universe .",
    "systematic approach suggests for us to begin with theory of tachyon field rolling down from the top of its potential .",
    "the curvature of the potential at the origin is negative , and we expect tachyonic instability of long wavelength fluctuations , similar to spinodal instability in usual field theory @xcite . thus there is an issue of initial conditions for rolling tachyon cosmology",
    ".    suppose ( by choice of initial conditions where @xmath4 is displaced from the origin ) tachyon evolves towards its ground state as homogeneous condensate .",
    "we considered the model with minimum at finite @xmath1 and with quadratic approximation of @xmath0 around the minimum .",
    "then the background tachyon oscillates around the minimum with frequency of order of @xmath85 , and its ( averaged over several oscillations ) equation of state is @xmath86 . however , we found from perturbation theory that tachyon fluctuations are exponentially unstable due to the tachyon self - interaction with background oscillations .",
    "it means that in this model homogeneous tachyon condensate decays . to answer the question what will be the resulting tachyon configuration",
    ", one has to go to the next level beyond the perturbation theory and to consider fully nonlinear problem of evolution of non - condensate tachyon fluid .",
    "we also consider homogeneous tachyon rolling towards its ground state in the model with @xmath87 , including expansion of the universe . in this model",
    ", the background tachyon condensate has vanishing pressure and finite energy density diluting as @xmath88 .",
    "considering linear perturbations of tachyon field coupled with small metric perturbations , we found gravitational instability of tachyon field , @xmath89 .",
    "however , linear theory very soon ( tens of @xmath1 ) becomes irrelevant .",
    "we argue that non - vanishing energy density of tachyon condensate is incompatible with large scale tachyon flows . again , to make more certain conclusion about tachyon cosmology in this model , one has to use non - linear analysis to follow further evolution of inhomogeneities .",
