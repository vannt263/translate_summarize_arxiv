    "primordial angular momentum is believed to decay with the expansion of the universe and the observed rotations of galaxies and clusters are believed to originate from tidal interactions with local environments ( the tidal torque theory ) or the acquisition of orbital angular momentum from infalling matter ( the merging theory ) . in the tidal torque theory @xcite , a collapsing cloud at the turn - around epoch",
    "may obtain a tidal torque due to the misalignment between the local tidal shear and structural inertia tensor .",
    "consequently , the spin directions of halos may provide information on the nearby mass distribution @xcite , although some studies @xcite have reported inconclusive or opposing results from observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the merging theory @xcite focuses on the change in angular momentum in hierarchical clusterings through the off - center infall of nearby objects / matter to drive the sudden change in halo spin @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argued that simulated halos do not show any obvious correlation between spin and merger history .",
    "each theory views the same object from different angles .",
    "a dark matter halo is not static but dynamically evolves through the sometimes violent , sometimes quiet ingestion of nearby matter . according to hierarchical clustering @xcite ,",
    "large halos grow in mass by assimilating nearby smaller halos",
    ". however , a small satellite halo tends to have a spiral infall motion with a finite orbital angular momentum around the central halo , which , after merging , causes a net change in rotational angular momentum of the merging remnants .",
    "this non - radial infall motion of satellites may be derived from the tidal torque of anisotropic matter distributions around the central halo",
    ". however , the acquisition of satellite orbital angular momentum described in the merging theory is analogous to that of a mass shell in the tidal torque theory because they are based on the same ground : the tidal torque generated by local environments .",
    "the only difference is whether they consider the infalling source to be a satellite or a mass shell . by extending the original tidal torque theory of a spherical collapse to the multiple - shell collapses at different epochs",
    ", the tension between the two theories may be relaxed .",
    "the distributions of halo spin have been reported to be well fitted by the log - normal function @xcite , with small deviations depending on the definition of the halo samples @xcite .",
    "researchers have found that massive cluster halos are not yet relaxed from recent mergers and are responsible for the over - population of the high-@xmath0 tail compared to the log - normal distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the origin of the log - normality of spin distributions based on the stochastic variables of halo angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) , total energy ( @xmath2 ) , and mass ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "theirs was the first attempt of its kind to address this issue .",
    "they introduced stochasticity between the two terms @xmath4 and @xmath2 and argued that deviations from the log - normal functional form are mainly due to correlations between the two terms .",
    "however , they did not provide a physical or probable reason for the stochasticity between the two terms .    in the present study",
    ", we analyze the origin of the halo spin distribution . using simulated mass histories of individual halos and the stochastic differential equation of the angular momentum change , we model the spin evolution using the _ stochastic model _ , distinguishing between the roles of major merging and accretion in shaping the spin distributions in various situations @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : spindef ] , we describe the stochastic for spin evolution .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : data ] , we describe the simulation data , merging trees , and local environments of a halo . from the simulated merging history , we measure distributions of angular momentum change with respect to halo mass , spin , local environments , infall mass ratio , and redshift in section  [ sec : change ] . in section  [ sec : spin ] , using the simulated mass histories of individual halos , we randomly generate spin changes and compare the spin distributions of the stochastic model and @xmath5-body simulations . in section  [ sec : markov ]",
    ", we verify how a random - walk process produces the log - normal distribution of the halo spin .",
    "we summarize the results of our study in section  [ sec : concl ]    all of the logarithms used in the equations and figures in this study are base 10 .",
    "@xcite first proposed a dimensionless parameter to quantify the rotation of a cosmic object or halo as @xmath6 where @xmath0 is the spin , @xmath2 is the total energy , @xmath3 is the virial mass , and @xmath1 is the rotational angular momentum of a halo .",
    "however , measuring halo potential is practically bothersome , and the potential of an open system is sometimes ill - defined .",
    "therefore , another definition was proposed by @xcite , which reads as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the virial radius , and @xmath9 is the virial circular velocity .",
    "the virial radius can be derived from the definition of virial mass as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the critical density at redshift @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for a flat universe",
    "these widely used spin parameters are equivalent to @xmath0 in the case of an idealized halo ; halos are fully virialized and their density profiles follow the isothermal model .",
    "however , simulated halos may show a significant discrepancy between @xmath0 and @xmath15 because most are not fully virialzed and their radial profiles do not follow the isothermal model .",
    "the gravitational potential of a halo should be measured using the same finite softening length ( @xmath16 ) as adopted in @xmath5-body simulations because the chosen potential estimation strongly depends on the potential model : the newtonian ( @xmath17 ) or plummer ( @xmath18 ) model .",
    "the difference increases at higher redshift @xcite . to comply with the simulated potential",
    ", we measure the halo potential using @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , great care must to be taken when interpreting the halo spin value .    in this study",
    ", we adopt a new spin parameter @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 which is introduced to correct for all possible systematics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we call @xmath23 a correcting factor . hereafter , whenever we refer to a halo spin , we mean the corrected spin and use @xmath0 to denote it .",
    "of course , one may return to @xmath24 simply by dividing the spin value by @xmath23 .      from equation  ( [ spinp ] ) , we derive a stochastic differential equation of spin change as @xmath25 where @xmath26 here",
    ", @xmath27 is a cosmological effect depending on the redshift and model parameters .",
    "however , its contribution is relatively trivial compared with the constant factor of @xmath28 in equation  ( [ excur ] ) unless @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that the background history of the universe does not much affect the evolution of the spin parameter ( lemson & kauffmann 1999 ; cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "this differential equation was derived to model the spin change as a function of the mass event ( mass - merging or mass - loss event ) accompanying a change in angular momentum amplitude @xmath30 . here",
    ", we introduce a markov chain process of spin evolution as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the angular momentum change rate is defined as @xmath33 since @xmath27 is relatively small , we will not explicitly mention it , even though we include this contribution in the subsequent calculations .",
    "we stress the importance of @xmath27 later in appendix  [ sec : alpha ] .    throughout this stochastic approach ,",
    "our primary assumption is that a spin change , @xmath34 , does not depend on the past history of a halo but can be completely described by the current physical status of the halo ; the spin change is determined by the stochastic probability of angular momentum change , @xmath35 , which will later be shown to be a function of @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath36 , @xmath12 , and local environments .",
    "later , we will prove that if @xmath35 is a gaussian distribution , then the resulting spin distribution follows the log - normal shape . in the stochastic equation , there is one independent variable , @xmath37 , which should be determined outside of the model .",
    "the halo mass history could be provided by @xmath5-body simulations or by an extended press & schechter ( eps ) formalism . however , in this analysis , we limit our study to the simulated mass histories . hereafter , we define a major merger event and an accretion ( or minor - merger ) event as mass changes of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we run a series of cosmological @xmath5-body simulations with @xmath40 particles using the gotpm code @xcite .",

    "we call the former halo an `` ancestor '' and the latter a `` major descendent . ''",
    "if a halo has no major descendent , then we terminate the line .",
    "the chains of these merging lines consist of a merging tree with which we are able to trace the histories of halo angular momentum , mass , and other physical quantities .",
    "one should note that the main merger tree is a trimmed version of the merging tree widely quoted in other studies .",
    "note that , on average , about 25% of halos experience a mass loss in a time step of this study , which means that its major descendent ( or successor ) becomes less massive .",
    "this happens when a halo undergoes a violent merging process and is broken into multiple less - massive remnants or when a halo passes another and is stripped of some member particles .",
    "now , let us look at the spin evolution of simulated halos and their main - merging trees . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we show several typical examples selected from the simulations .",
    "there are several significant spin decreases to less than @xmath84 or increases to greater than @xmath85 , but halo spins immediately bounce back to settle over the range of @xmath86 . here",
    ", we suppose that spin change is random , but there is a hidden mechanism that regulates the spin value to lie in a certain range .",
    "a sudden massive merger event may cause a halo to rotate quickly , resulting in a substantial loss of angular momentum due to the ejection of high - angular momentum material through violent relaxation . a smaller halo may pass a nearby larger halo ( being attached when they encounter but separated afterward ) , after which point the larger halo experiences a sudden increase and decrease in spin value .",
    "of course , during the encounter , there could be an exchange of finite angular momentum and the host may not fully recover its original angular momentum .",
    "as stated before , several events of mass loss events due to the separation of satellites can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] ( a line segment moving to the left ) .",
    "we define a local density measured from 10 nearest neighbor halos as a halo environment .",
    "the halos tracing the local density , called `` background halos '' , are all halos with mass greater than @xmath87 ( equal to the sum of 300 particle masses ) at @xmath88 . however ,",
    "at higher redshifts ( @xmath89 ) , the number of massive halos is much lower and , therefore , we reduce the mass limit to @xmath90 at @xmath91 and even further to @xmath92 at @xmath93 .    the variable - width spline kernel is adopted to adaptively resolve high - density regions as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the distance from the @xmath96th halo to the @xmath97th background halo , and @xmath98 is the distance to the tenth nearest neighbor .",
    "the density measure was first used with 20 neighbors in park et al .",
    "the kernel size varying with environments helps dense regions not to be oversmoothed .",
    "the spline kernel has the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the median radius of the kernel is @xmath101 h@xmath102mpc .",

    "if a region has a density of @xmath106 , then we refer to it as an under - dense or void region .",

    "if @xmath143 , then the halo spin will increase ; however , if @xmath144 , then the spin tends to decrease .",
    "if @xmath122 has a negative slope and crosses @xmath145 , then the spin random walk ( eq .

    "virtually every mass sample shows a negative slope , and the range of the characteristic spin is @xmath149 .",
    "a more massive sample tends to have a lower value of @xmath150 .    if @xmath151 , then the rotational axis ( @xmath152 ) of the halo and the direction of the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath153 ) of infalling matter tend to be anti - correlated",
    "however , if @xmath154 , then those two vectors show a positive correlation , while the mass increase is more dominant than the angular momentum increase ; as a result , the halo spin decreases ( see eq .",
    "[ spinp ] ) .",
    "if @xmath143 , then these two vectors show a strong correlation , and halo spin tends to increase accordingly .",
    "therefore , a positive correlation between two angular momentums does not always increase the halo spin depending on the amount of angular momentum change .",
    "the behavior of @xmath155 may shape a so - called asymptotic state of the spin distribution .",
    "if a halo spin is significantly larger or smaller than @xmath146 , then the halo may experience a kind of pressure toward @xmath146 ; as a result , the halo spin tends to move toward @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath146 plays an important role in guiding the spin evolution .",
    "of course , all halos do not immediately jump to @xmath146 but show a spread over a certain range of @xmath0 around @xmath146 , which is regulated by the shape of @xmath156 .",
    "more massive halos tend to have lower @xmath146 , which means that lower spin values are preferred in more massive halo samples .",

    ", the halo spin tends to increase as the local density increases and accretions are less likely to increase the spin value as much as major mergings at the same local density ; meanwhile , a less massive halo tends to have a larger spin value at the same mass increase ( @xmath37 ) . in void regions ,",
    "halos have the lowest value of @xmath146 . from this description ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath122 in lower density regions tends to be lower than that in higher density regions ( or less - aligned infall directions ) , and accretion may favor a less biased infall direction lowering the characteristic spin .",
    "also , smaller cluster halos tend to have more aligned mass infalls ( or a higher value of @xmath146 ) than larger cluster halos .",
    "the environmental dependence of @xmath146 is more clearly observed in the case of higher @xmath37 .",

    "accretion ( @xmath163 ) at low redshift ( @xmath161 , left panels ) is more frequent than at the higher redshift ( @xmath159 , right panels ) .",
    "moreover , halos in less dense regions at low redshifts are likely to have less frequent major - merging events ; this environmental dependence is not observed at high redshifts .",
    "therefore , we conclude that major - merging events subside with time , and this tendency becomes stronger in lower density regions",
    ". this may be due to the accelerating expansion of the universe at lower redshifts .",
    "the acceleration may reduce the number of major - merging events ; therefore , accretion would be a dominant source of mass increase in recent epochs .",
    "lower - density regions , especially voids , may suffer more seriously from such acceleration .",
    "we need to clarify two confusing terms : random walk and correlated ( or biased ) infall . in this study",
    ", a random walk means that the angular momentum change at a given merging step is purely stochastic , obeying the distribution of @xmath114 .",
    "however , the @xmath114 distribution ( or @xmath35 ) has , in most cases , has a finite mean value : a positive bias ( @xmath164 ) or negative bias ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "the correlated infall direction indicates a preferential direction for mass infall with respect to the halo rotation axis ( or its spin axis ; see appendix [ appen1 ] for details ) and does not conflict with the random - walk hypothesis .    since @xmath122 is finite ( and mostly positive )",
    ", the orientations of the orbital angular momentum of infalling matter are not perfectly random but are somewhat correlated or anti - correlated with the halo rotational axis ( or the direction of the angular momentum vector ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that as the halo spin approaches zero , even a small amount of mass infall ( or accretion ) may significantly increase the halo spin value ( @xmath166 ) , which may explain the sharp increase in @xmath122 as the sample spin approaches zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "an illustration of a spin random walk is a staggering walk taken by a drunken man .",
    "consider a half - pipe with a u - shaped cross section and , then , a group of drunken men take a walk lurching forward along the bottom of the half - pipe without mutual collisions .",
    "here , the shape of the cross section is not fixed , and the pipe is not like @xmath35 , which varies with sample parameters .",
    "therefore , the distribution of walker positions gradually changes to adjust itself to the cross - sectional shape of the half - pipe , and the majority of walkers are distributed near the bottom of the pipe ( @xmath150 in the halo spin walk ) . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the results of spin random walks and the effects of various parameters on the shape of spin distributions .",
    "in this section , we will show how well the stochastic model reproduces distributions of halo spin measured from @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "the change in angular momentum is expected to be a random process with a distribution that has a bimodal gaussian form .",
    "we assume that the spin change in each time step is independent of the previous history ( a markov process ; see @xcite for an example applied to halo mass function ) and is completely determined by the current physical status . however , it is possible that subsequent infall events can be correlated with previous events .",
    "for example , consider successive mass infalls through a local filamentary structure . in this case , the random - walk hypothesis is not satisfied",
    ". we will discuss possible correlated infalls in the latter part of this section .",
    "first , we choose a mass history from simulated main merger trees .",
    "the initial spin value is set to @xmath167 . at each merging step",
    ", we identify @xmath35 of a subsample with parameter ranges enclosing the current halo mass , spin , mass change , local density , and redshift . then , from the identified @xmath35 we randomly generate a value of @xmath168 . from equation ( [ eq : walk ] ) with @xmath168",
    ", we calculate the change in spin ( @xmath169 ) and update the spin value . in the next merging step ,",
    "we iterate the same process but with the updated spin value .",
    "the resulting spin value ( @xmath170 ) at the final redshift is obtained as @xmath171      now , we obtain the spin distribution produced by the stochastic random walk and compare it with that of @xmath5-body simulations .    figure [ fig11 ] shows the results with randomly generated spin distributions ( blue histogram ) against @xmath5-body simulated distributions ( red histogram ) in four mass samples .",
    "the randomly generated spin distributions at @xmath172 are similar to the simulated distributions with a slight shift to higher @xmath0 , and this difference is observed in every mass sample , although the difference is negligible at higher redshift .    in table",
    "[ tab : fit1 ] in appendix  [ appen5 ] , the log - normal fitting results for randomly generated and simulated spin distributions are given with a mean value , standard deviation , and @xmath173/degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "this difference is more clearly shown in figure [ fig12 ] , where the blue and red histograms are the distributions of the random and simulated spins at @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "the green curve is a gaussian fit to the simulated spin distribution . before jumping to a detailed comparison",
    ", it would be valuable to note that @xmath5-body - simulated halos overpopulate at the high-@xmath0 tail ( the same feature is also observed for the generated spin distributions ) compared to the log - normal fitting ( solid curve ) , which has also been found in other studies @xcite , unless a correction is applied to the halo samples @xcite . in figure [ fig13 ]",
    ", we show the difference ( @xmath174 ) between the simulated ( @xmath175 ) and randomly generated ( @xmath176 ) spin distributions .",
    "the differences increase as redshift decreases , while deviations in the randomly generated spin distributions at @xmath177 and 2 are confined within about 1015% error .      if a spin walk is well described by the markov ( or random ) process and a sufficient number of trials are performed to suppress the poisson error , then the @xmath5-body - simulated and randomly generated spin distributions should be basically equal to each other .",
    "therefore , a subtle failure in recovering the simulated spin distribution at lower redshifts , as seen in figure [ fig11 ] , may imply a possible limitation of the stochastic model .    a possible explanation for the mismatch of spin distributions between the simulation and the stochastic model is correlated mass merging , which means a subsequent mass infall changes the angular momentum of a halo in the same direction .",
    "then , a set of @xmath168s in the successive infalls may not be random but correlated .",
    "this correlated mass merging could be a function of local environment .",
    "in void regions , halos are likely to have fewer major mergers , while those in cluster regions may experience more frequent heavy mass infalls ( see fig . [ fig10 ] ) . because it is believed that major mergers frequently occur when clumps of matter fall along filamentary structures , the number of filaments connected to a halo determines whether or not the spin walk is random . in void regions ,",
    "filamentary structures are relatively rare and void halos tend to have a small number of filaments around them , which means that subsequent major mergers may occur along a smaller number of filamentary structures .",
    "figures [ fig14][fig16 ] show the environmental effect on spin distribution at three redshifts . in table",
    "[ tab : fit2 ] of appendix  [ appen5 ] , the log - normal fitting results are listed .",
    "we clearly see that a randomly generated spin ( blue histogram ) tends to substantially overestimate the halo spin of the @xmath5-body - simulation in lower density regions .    for the group and cluster samples",
    ", the difference in spin distributions between the simulation and the stochastic model is relatively small .",
    "however , with time the difference increases with time and the group sample begins to show such a discrepancy at @xmath172 .    since a massive halo is likely to be located in a knot ( interconnection ) of local filamentary structures , the probability of successive major mergers along a single filament is low ( the next major merger may occur with another filamentary structure ) .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to determine whether the randomly generated halo spins of more massive samples have a distribution similar to that of the @xmath5-body simulation . in figure [ fig17 ] , we show the generated spin distributions of a massive sample of @xmath178 in different local environments . no substantial difference is shown even in void regions . therefore , it is quite reasonable to believe that massive halos tend to show random evolution in spin .    in these figures ,",
    "the halo spin distribution depends on the local environment ; denser regions cause halos to rotate faster , which is also confirmed in figure  [ fig8 ] ( @xmath146 is higher in a denser region ) . also ,",
    "most of the spin samples show log - normal distributions , except for the cluster samples at @xmath172 , where the distribution has a slightly fat tail at larger @xmath0 .",
    "this may be due to unrelaxed halos in cluster regions where violent mergers are so frequent that cluster halos do not have sufficient time to transfer angular momentum to outside and finally to be virialized .",
    "throughout this paper , the stochastic model we adopted assumes that the spin walk can be described by the markov process , which requires that a random walk be memoryless or independent of previous states .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine whether the spin walk observed in @xmath5-body simulations is really random ( markovian ) or not ( non - markovian ) .",
    "one of the easiest ways to verify the correlation of two separate events in a halo merging history is to measure the autocorrelation ( or serial correlation ) between a pair of events in a main merger tree line .",
    "the first - order autocorrelation of two mass events of @xmath96 and @xmath97 is @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a weight , @xmath114 is randomly generated by the stochastic model or provided by simulations , @xmath120 is the mean , and @xmath121 is the standard deviation of the probability distribution of @xmath114 . in this analysis , we adopt @xmath181 and define the lag-@xmath182 autocorrelation as @xmath183 where @xmath184 and the summation is performed over all possible lag-@xmath182 pairs of events in a halo history to redshift @xmath12 .",
    "only a relative comparison is possible because the time interval between a lag-@xmath182 pair changes .    using 100 random realizations of @xmath185 , we statistically measured the deviation of the autocorrelations of @xmath5-body data from random expectations .",
    "the probability distribution of a lag - one autocorrelation is shown in figure [ fig18 ] for halo samples of @xmath130 in four local - density regions ( colored symbols ) .",
    "the brown histogram is a mean expectation measured from the 100 random realizations .",
    "even though the probability distribution of @xmath114 depends on the local density , the autocorrelation seems to be indistinguishable between different local - density samples and even from the random model in this plot .",
    "we also showed deviations between simulated correlations and the random model with @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the simulated autocorrelation and @xmath188 is the average of the 100 randomly generated autocorrelations .",

    "the shaded region depicts the 1@xmath121 distributions of the random model , and the symbols are measured from @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "it is easy to see the negative autocorrelations of @xmath189 at @xmath190 and the positive correlations of @xmath191 at @xmath172 with greater than 2@xmath121 confidence limits .",
    "we further investigated autocorrelations from @xmath192 to @xmath193 but found nothing substantially deviating from the random model . on the other hand",
    ", we could not detect any possible autocorrelations in the massive sample ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "most of the simulated autocorrelations are contained within 1@xmath121 random expectations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] ) .    detecting substantial autocorrelations of @xmath189 at @xmath190 and @xmath191 at @xmath172",
    "may provide a tangible clue for void discrepancies between the simulated and generated spin distributions .",
    "correlated infall events may cause void halos to have smaller spin values , but we are unable to detect any environmental dependence in the correlation figure .",
    "however , considering the frequent major merging of cluster halos , an autocorrelation could easily be counterbalanced by other major - merging events .",
    "however , the void halos have little possibility of another major merging .      in this subsection",
    ", we demonstrate that the log - normal distribution is a natural consequence of the stochastic differential equation in the stochastic of halo spin .",
    "in many studies , simulated spin distributions in various mass samples consistently show substantial deviations from the log - normal form in the high-@xmath0 tail .",
    "however , no serious deviations are found as long as a mass sample is further divided into local - density subsamples . as shown in figures [ fig14][fig16 ] , the log - normal fitting functions ( green curves ) seem to describe well the simulated spin distributions ( red histograms ) in various local environments , except for cluster regions at @xmath172 .",
    "now , consider a one - factor model of the markov process or the model of geometric brownian motion ( gbm ; @xcite ) , which has a stochastic differential equation of @xmath195 where @xmath196 describes the long - term drift of the system , @xmath197 is a constant , and @xmath198 is a kind of normally distributed wiener process or @xmath199 where @xmath200 denotes the normal distribution with a zero mean value and a variance of @xmath201 .    from the properties of the wiener process such as @xmath202 for @xmath203 , we obtain the probability distribution of @xmath204 as @xmath205 where the statistical relation of @xmath206 is used .",

    "[ gbm ] ) and @xmath213 ( eq .  [ weq ] ) , and ignored the higher - order terms of @xmath214 . by integrating the above equation , we finally obtain @xmath215 now , one can understand that the logarithm of the stochastic process @xmath0 follows a wiener process with a standard deviation of @xmath216 and a corrected long - term drift of @xmath217 ( @xcite for details ) .",
    "if @xmath198 does not have a normal distribution , then we may not obtain a logarithm of the randomly distributing quantity .",
    "for example , if @xmath198 has a probability proportional to @xmath218 or @xmath219 , then the resulting distribution would be exponential or gaussian , respectively .",
    "we now attempt to combine the right two right - hand terms in equation ( [ gbm ] ) into @xmath220 as @xmath221 where @xmath222 $ ] . after changing variables as @xmath223 and @xmath224",
    ", we can find an analogy between the gbm and the angular momentum change , @xmath114 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : walk ] ) .",
    "although the overall distribution of @xmath114 is better fit by the bimodal gaussian , the distribution around a peak can be well modeled by a single gaussian peak because the two gaussian components have nearly the same center in most samples , and we may simply approximate @xmath35 around the peak as a normal distribution .",
    "the minor gaussian component with a broad width is mostly needed to describe the fat tails on both sides .",
    "consequently , the distribution of @xmath225 follows the normal process , which means that the spin distribution of @xmath0 should accordingly be log - normal .",
    "if the centers of two gaussian components are well separated , or the minor gaussian component is comparable to the major one , then the resulting distribution of @xmath226 may show a considerable deviation from the normal distribution .    here",
    ", we need to address the validity of the application of the gbm model to spin evolution before jumping to a conclusion , and thus we test whether the halo spin change satisfies two prerequisites of the gbm model :    * @xmath196 ( or @xmath122 ) should depend only on @xmath201 ( or @xmath227 ) ; and * the standard deviation of @xmath220 ( or @xmath123 ) should be proportional to @xmath228 ( or @xmath229 ) .    to qualitatively assess the first condition , figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] ,",
    "[ fig5 ] , and [ fig6 ] show that there is no significant change in @xmath122 with different redshifts , local environments , or infall mass ratios , except for major - merging events , in which case a substantially larger @xmath122 is obtained .",
    "consequently , one can easily see the mass dependence in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the second condition might be related to the temporal resolution affecting the mass infall ratio .",
    "now , we investigate the following relation : @xmath230 where @xmath216 is constant with respect to @xmath231 as long as the second requirement is satisfied . in order to obtain a log - normal distribution of @xmath0 , @xmath232",
    "should be linearly scaled to the change in halo mass . as shown previously ,",
    "the spin distribution has a mass and environmental dependences , indicating that the distribution is not stationary but evolves with the halo mass .",
    "however , halo environments do not change substantially over cosmic time since a halo does not generally move a great distance ( @xmath233 a few mpc ) .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to examine the relation between @xmath232 and @xmath36 in the same environment .",
    "figure [ fig21 ] shows the change in @xmath232 over a range of infall mass ratios at @xmath172 .",
    "the measured relation substantially deviates from a single power - law scaling but we can divide the range of @xmath36 into three regions : @xmath234 ( quiet accretion ) , @xmath235 ( strong accretion ) , and @xmath236 ( major merging ) .",
    "each region , except for the strong accretion mode , has its own power - law relation of @xmath237 .",
    "the major - merging mode and quiet accretion mode have different variances in that the major - merging mode has a higher value of @xmath216 .",
    "this implies that the major merger mode has a relatively larger stochastic walk size than the quiet accretion ( see eq .",
    "[ gbm ] ) . the transition ( or strong accretion ) mode ( @xmath238 ) does not seem to satisfy the assumptions of the gbm model .",
    "now we conclude that even though there exist limitations in applying the gbm model to spin evolution , the spin walk is well described by the gbm model and , consequently , the resulting spin distribution follows the log - normal function .",
    "we concluded that the spin distribution is well described by a random walk of angular momentum .",
    "halos in lower density regions in recent epochs present some failures",
    ". this may be due to correlated major - merging events ( see further discussions in appendix  [ appen1 ] and [ appen2 ] ) .",
    "the log - normality of the spin distribution is found to be a consequence of the stochastic random walk , and most density samples show log - normal distributions of the halo spin .",
    "only a small departure is found in the cluster samples at @xmath172 , mainly because a fraction of halos are not yet relaxed .",
    "we found that the angular momentum of a halo is likely to increase after merging , and the spin distribution depends on the sample mass .",
    "if the sample mass is higher , then the average spin value decreases .",
    "the simulated log - normal distribution of the spin is well recovered by the stochastic model with bimodal gaussian distributions of angular momentum change .    in the standard @xmath239cdm model",
    ", the universe has undergone a recent accelerating expansion , making it difficult to pull nearby material into a local shallow gravitational center .",
    "compared with the flat @xmath240 model , the @xmath239cdm model has prominent filamentary structures lacking many small and faint structures that could be easily destroyed by the recent cosmic acceleration .",
    "this effect is even stronger in void regions where the mass evolution was already halted at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , the cosmological effects may leave clear evidence in the spin evolution of void halos and mean - field halos at lower redshifts ( @xmath2412 ; see the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .    because of the bimodal gaussian shape of the angular momentum change in the stochastic model , one may raise the question of the possible existence of another hidden parameter for subsampling merging events to measure @xmath35 . by introducing another parameter",
    ", a simpler distribution shape may be obtained .",
    "a bimodal gaussian shape could be obtained through a possible correlation among spin walks , which seems to be significant in void regions and in mean fields .",
    "this may explain the deviations in halo spin distributions from the log - normal distribution .    in this study",
    ", we directly adopt the simulated mass evolution for the halo mass change ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "there are several models for the mass merging based on the eps formalism ( @xcite for the classical and @xcite for variant eps models ) , which can also provide us the probability of merging phases ( major merger or accretion ) between time steps .",
    "since our stochastic model may discriminate between the effects of accretion and major merging in spin distributions , we may check whether the variant eps models may produce proper probability distributions of @xmath242 compared to simulated ones for a given time step . in appendix  [ epsmodel ] , we show the roles of major merging and accretion in shaping the spin distribution in detail by adopting a toy model with fixed the mass - merging ratio and how much the mass - merging history generated by the classical eps model predicts different spin distributions from the @xmath5-body simulated ones .",
    "@xmath27 deserves more investigation because its effect on spin distribution is not negligible .",
    "the cosmological contributions to log - spin change with a mass increase in @xmath37 are @xmath243 in most redshift intervals of merging data .",
    "so , even though its contribution is neglected , spin error is less than 1% .",
    "but , the error accumulates over the number of merging steps and may substantially change the spin distribution .",
    "figure [ fig_a1 ] shows how the spin distribution changes when the @xmath27 term is neglected in the random walk process .",
    "the generated spin distribution is substantially shifted to higher @xmath0 , which demonstrates the sensitivity of spin walk to such a very small value or possible error in fitting @xmath35 and how large the sample size should be to suppress this kind of a noise effect .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that we may determine the cosmological model from the measured spin distribution because the measured @xmath35 in this analysis may differ in different cosmological models .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the angle alignment between the rotation ( @xmath1 ) of a halo and the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath244 ) of infalling matter .",
    "if they are positively or negatively aligned , then the rotational angular momentum of a halo is expected to increase or decrease , correspondingly . therefore , this analysis is complementary to the work on the change in angular momentum ( @xmath114 ) . in this section ,",

    "[ fig_a3 ] ) are likely to have slightly negative correlations with @xmath248 ( anti - aligned ) , while average - spin halos tend to have a slightly positive alignment , and high - spin halos ( figs .",

    "on the other hand , in major - merging mode , the low - spin , average - spin , and high - spin samples show negative , random , and positive correlations , respectively .",
    "if two angular momentum vectors are anti - aligned , then a halo s rotational angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) is reduced and , consequently , its spin value is lowered .",
    "therefore , a halo with an average spin value is likely to have a slightly positive correlation to offset the negative drag term ( @xmath28 ) , while a high - spin or low - spin halo tends to have positively or negatively aligned mass infalls , respectively .",
    "then , the alignment of two vectors and the value of a halo spin are closely correlated with each other , producing a high spin value , and vice versa .",

    "this may curb the development of spin as a whole and may explain the reason why void halos seem to have a non - markovian walk of @xmath114 .",
    "halos in denser regions are expected to experience frequent major mergers .",
    "thus , even though there is anti - alignment between two steps , the many other major merger events violently erase the memory of previous anti - correlations .",
    "therefore , the superpositions of multiple anti - correlations are completely mixed and may result in a random - like process . however , void halos tend to experience relatively few major mergers , and the effect of anti - alignment in a rare pair of merging events may survive for a longer time .",
    "this may explain why void halos are not properly described by the stochastic random walk of @xmath114 .",
    "we discuss the number of major mergers a halo may experience during its life time in appendix [ append4 ] .",
    "we estimate the autocorrelation between a pair of nearest major merger events to determine whether substantial amounts of correlation could be detected . in this case",
    ", we only consider autocorrelations between major merger events .",
    "the deviations of autocorrelations between major mergers ( @xmath257 ) are shown in figure [ fig_a8 ] for several redshifts . in this figure ,",
    "major merger autocorrelations at high redshifts ( @xmath258 ) are equivalent to the random distributions , while weak positive correlations are detected ( @xmath259 ) at lower redshifts .",
    "more massive samples do not show any positive or negative correlations , as seen in panel ( b ) of figure [ fig_a8 ] .",
    "therefore , in this plot , we are sure that there is no substantial autocorrelation between major mergers .",
    "we determine the distribution of major merger frequency in each halo sample at @xmath172 to confirm our argument that void halos experience fewer major mergers , which may explain the deviations of the stochastic model prediction from @xmath5-body spin distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig_a9 ] , we show the number of major mergers ( @xmath260 ) per halo with masses @xmath130 ( a ) or @xmath261 ( b ) . in the sample of @xmath130 ,",
    "the number difference between halos in different environments is not severe at higher redshift ( @xmath262 ) , while , at lower redshifts , less dense samples clearly show fewer major mergers .",
    "however , more massive samples ( b ) show nearly negligible deviations from each other , demonstrating noticeable differences only at @xmath172 .",
    "the peak number of the @xmath260 distribution is four , while it is three at higher redshifts ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the correlated random walk seen in void regions may be a joint effect of the major - to - major merger autocorrelation and the smaller number of major mergers in less dense regions .",
    "it is interesting to find that a significant fraction of halos in cluster regions do not experience a major merger event during their lifetime ( 5% of halos with @xmath264 and 1 % of halos with @xmath178 ) .",
    "also , the fraction of cluster halos needed to prohibit a major merger event after @xmath265 is significantly higher than that of halos in lower density regions .",
    "in this section , we present the means and standard deviations of spin distributions from @xmath5-body simulations and random generations together with fitting results to a log - normal function with least @xmath173 . see tables  [ tab : fit1 ] and [ tab : fit2 ] .",
    "the mean value of the halo spin increases with local density and redshift .",
    "the difference between @xmath5-body and random simulations increases as local density decreases .",
