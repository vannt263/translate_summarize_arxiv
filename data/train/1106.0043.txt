    "the numerical simulation of electromagnetic fields inside both metamaterial and photonic crystals is an important tool for analyzing these periodic structures . in particular ,",
    "the eigenmodes of crystals , defined as freely propagating waves not coupled to external currents , are often of the most interest .",
    "the conventional method  @xcite of numerically solving for crystal eigenmodes is to define the geometry of the unit cell of the crystal of interest and the differential equation that the fields must obey in this geometry and then impose bloch periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the partial differential equation problem is then discretized using one of the many standard methods ( finite element , finite integral , finite difference , etc . ) thereby turning it into an algebraic eigenvalue problem with a finite number of degrees of freedom and the frequency @xmath1 as the eigenvalue .",
    "this finite sized eigenvalue problem is then solved numerically .",
    "an important detail of this method is that the bloch wavenumber @xmath2 is chosen beforehand , and the frequency is then computed as a function of the wavenumber , yielding the dispersion curves @xmath3 .",
    "this is the most commonly used method for calculating dispersion curves of the electromagnetic waves propagating in photonic crystals or in closely related metamaterial crystals .",
    "there are however , many instances where it is more convenient to specify the frequency @xmath1 and solve for the wavenumber as a function of frequency : @xmath4 .",
    "at least four such instances can be identified .",
    "first , metamaterials often contain dispersive materials such as metals , where the dielectric function strongly depends on the frequency on the wave . in this case",
    ", the eigenfrequency problem becomes a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and must be solved iteratively  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when solving for the wavenumber as a function of frequency , the resulting eigenvalue problem only needs to be solved once .",
    "second , it is often useful to solve for the wavenumber as the eigenvalue because of the information contained in the complex wavenumber including the decay lengths of the electromagnetic modes ( either due to finite dissipation or because of the evanescent nature of the mode ) and the figure of merit  @xcite of negative index modes .",
    "third , in the majority of experiments electromagnetic fields inside metamaterial / photonic crystals are excited by external sources producing time - harmonic fields with real valued frequencies .",
    "a complex wavenumber eigenvalue simulation provides the correct field distribution in the photonic crystal relevant to such an experiment .",
    "fourth , this approach provides a very natural way of calculating the so - called isofrequency surfaces corresponding to @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is real .",
    "isofrequency diagrams are fundamentally important for predicting wave refraction at the pc interfaces  @xcite and for calculating the density of states  @xcite .",
    "there are several previously published methods on calculating @xmath0 dispersion curves including variations of the plane - wave expansion method  @xcite and diagonalizing the crystal transfer matrix  @xcite .",
    "a method of solving for complex wavenumber dispersion curves using the fem has been proposed  @xcite but only for 2d crystals .",
    "the benefits of the complex wavenumber 2d fem are becoming better appreciated and use of this method is becoming more common  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely to generalize this method of complex wavenumber eigenvalue simulations ( cwes ) from two to three dimension , which is the object of this paper .",
    "this 3d complex wavenumber eigenvalue simulation was recently used as part of a metamaterial homogenization procedure  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : fem_sec ] .",
    "the underlying field equations for the electric and magnetic fields and the necessary boundary conditions are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ photo_sec ] we apply this method to a 3d photonic crystal consisting of non - dispersive dielectric spheres .",
    "the photonic band structure for electromagnetic waves propagating both parallel and obliquely to the principal axes is calculated , and different types of modes ( transverse and longitudinal ) are identified . in sec .",
    "[ fishnet_sec ] we calculate the dispersion curves for a negative index fishnet metamaterial  @xcite and demonstrate the existence of four distinct negative index modes .",
    "we also calculate the two - dimensional isofrequency contours for the least damped transverse mode and demonstrate from the shape of the isofrequency contours that this transverse mode is hyperbolic .",
    "in this section we present the fem formulation for solving for the magnetic field .",
    "electromagnetic wave propagation is described by the maxwell equations which can be rearranged into a wave equation for either the electric field @xmath6 or the magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the wave equation for the magnetic field is    @xmath8    here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the microscopic permittivity and permeability of the metamaterial / photonic crystal of interest . due to the periodic nature of the crystal both",
    "are are assumed to be scalar functions periodic in the crystal lattice . according to bloch s theorem  @xcite the magnetic field can be represented as the product of a periodic function and an exponential factor    @xmath11,\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the frequency of the wave and @xmath2 is the wavevector of the bloch - floquet wave .",

    "( [ bloch_h ] ) and the electric field profile according to    @xmath15\\ ] ]      there are several commercial fem software programs ( comsol multiphysics by comsol , hfss by ansys , vector fields opera by cobham technical services , etc . ) that are available for modeling metamaterial / photonic crystals .",
    "these commercial software packages provide a convenient graphical user interface for defining a crystal s geometry , meshing the computational domain , and visualizing the electromagnetic fields .",
    "this allows for models to be quickly developed and tested . of the many commercial fem codes",

    "only the most essential features of the fem approach are reviewed ; more detailed treatments can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the fem is based on setting the integral of a so - called weak expression over the domain of interest to zero .",

    "the effect is that the tangential components of the electric field must be continuous across the internal boundary or @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electric fields on opposite sides of the internal boundary .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath13 is enforced by imposing periodic boundary conditions on the exterior boundaries of the unit cell . in comsol , these periodic boundary conditions override the natural boundary condition . however ,",
    "if a pec boundary condition is desired inside the unit cell ( e.g. , on the surface of a metal inclusion ) this can be accomplished by removing the subdomain representing the metal inclusion .",
    "now only the exterior side of the metal boundary remains and the natural boundary condition forces the tangential electric fields to zero on this boundary .",

    "the previous discussion focused on solving for the magnetic field @xmath7 or rather the periodic function @xmath13 equal to the magnetic field with the exponential bloch factor removed .",
    "this is especially convenient when an inclusion requires a pec boundary condition since that is the natural boundary condition when solving for @xmath7 .",
    "however , solving for the electric field is very similar to solving for the magnetic field .",
