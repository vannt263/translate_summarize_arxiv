    "it should be noted that decrease with transverse momentum @xmath1 of single  spin asymmetries ( ssa ) is a common feature of perturbative qcd approaches including those based on account for the various modifications implemented into the calculation scheme originally grounded on collinear factorization .",
    "the most recent progress in this field is described in @xcite .",
    "the decreasing dependence has not been directly observed experimentally , but the experimental data were not very conclusive due to large statistcal errors .",
    "however , the existing data are consistent with the flat transverse dependence of ssa in inclusive processes .",
    "this conclusion is valid for the old data on of @xmath2hyperon polarization @xcite , for example , and for the most recent data obtained at rhic @xcite .",
    "it is essential that the new data cover the wide region of the transverse momentum values up to @xmath3 gev / c . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that experimental data at higher values of @xmath1 would be needed to perform a more conclusive test of various pqcd theoretical approaches and their predictions .",
    "the model proposed in @xcite provided flat @xmath1 -dependence of ssa .",
    "the new data which have appeared very recently@xcite are consistent with the observed earlier trend , i.e. flat dependence on transverse momenta can be extended to the region of higher values of @xmath1 . since such high values of transverse momenta",
    "have been reached experimentally , one forced to conclude that the mechanism of the ssa s generation can have a nonperturbative origin .",
    "of course , presence of the significant statistical errors in the current experimental data ( cf .",
    "e.g @xcite ) is the serious obstacle on the way of derivation of a completely unambiguous final conclusion on the impossibility of a decreasing dependence of the ssa with @xmath1 .",
    "a nonperturbative qcd dynamics is closely interrelated with the two well  known phenomena , namely , color confinement and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( @xmath4sb ) ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath4sb  mechanism resulting in transition of current into constituent quarks is directly responsible for generation of their masses and appearance of quark condensates .",
    "constituent quarks are colored objects , they appear to be quasiparticles and a hadron is often represented as a loosely bounded system of the constituent quarks .",
    "simultaneously , the goldstone bosons which are the excitations of the condensates appear and mediate interactions of the constituent quarks .",
    "this interaction is mainly due to a pseudoscalar pion field and has therefore a spin  flip nature .",
    "spin states filtering results from the unitarization process in the @xmath5-channel and connects ssa with asymmetries in the position ( impact parameter ) space @xcite .",
    "the common features of ssa measurements at rhic and tevatron ( linear increase of asymmetry with @xmath6 and flat transverse momentum dependence at large transverse momentum , @xmath7 gev / c ) are reproduced and described in the framework of the semiclassical picture based on the further development of the chiral quark model suggested in @xcite and results of its use for the treatment of the polarized and unpolarized inclusive cross - sections including those obtained at rhic @xcite .",
    "we summarize now the essential features of the mechanism .",
    "valence constituent quarks are scattered simultaneously ( due to strong coupling with goldstone bosons ) and in a quasi - independent way by the effective strong field . in the initial state of the reaction @xmath8 the proton is polarized and for the wave function of the proton we use the simple su(6 ) model .",
    "the constituent quark @xmath9 with transverse up spin fluctuates into goldstone boson and another constituent quark @xmath10 with down spin , performing spin - flip transition @xcite : @xmath11 it should be noted that @xmath12-fluctuation of constituent quark does not change its flavor and color . assuming the equal probabilities of the processes with @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks :",
    "@xmath15 the production of @xmath12 by the polarized proton @xmath16 in this simple @xmath17 picture can be treated as a result of the fluctuation of the constituent quark @xmath9 ( @xmath18 or @xmath14 ) in the effective field into the system @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    since the total angular momentum is conserved , the compensation of quark spin flip should occur , i.e. to compensate quark spin flip @xmath20 , an orbital angular momentum @xmath21 should be associated with the final state of reaction ( [ trans ] ) . the introduction of @xmath22 implies a shift in the impact parameter value of the pion @xmath12 : @xmath23 note , that outside the hadron interior the goldstone bosons are the usual pions and kaons . due to different strengths of interaction at the different impact distances , i.e. @xmath24 the processes of transition @xmath9 and @xmath25 to @xmath12 will have different probabilities .",
    "it eventually leads to nonzero asymmetry @xmath26 .",
    "when the shift in impact parameter is negative , @xmath27 , the interaction is stronger than that with the positive shift , @xmath28 , and therefore the asymmetry @xmath26 is positive too .",
    "the shift in @xmath29 ( the impact parameter of final pion ) is correlated with the shift of the impact parameter of the collision according to the relation between impact parameters in the multiparticle production process : @xmath30 the production of @xmath12 with impact parameter @xmath31 is considered in the fragmentation region , i.e. at large @xmath6 the approximate relation @xmath32 which results from eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) has been used with additional assumption on the small values of feynman @xmath6 for the other particles .",
    "it should be noted that direction of spin of the proton is chosen to be along or opposite to the impact parameter vector @xmath33 .",
    "the integration over the asimuthal angle @xmath34 selects therefore the finctions @xmath35 ( see below ) corresponding to the respective directions of the proton spin .",
    "the mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "an essential feature of the mechanism is an account of unitarity in the direct channel of reaction .",
    "the corresponding formulas for inclusive cross  sections of the process @xmath36 have been obtained in @xcite : @xmath37 @xmath38 is the collison impact parameter .",
    "the function @xmath39 is the generalized reaction matrix ( averaged over initial spin states ) which is determined by the basic dynamics of the elastic scattering . the elastic scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation @xmath40",
    "is then given @xcite by the relation : @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{6}\\ ] ] the equation ( [ 6 ] ) allows one to obey unitarity for the elastic scattering amplitude provided the inequality @xmath42 takes place .",
    "the model @xcite has been used for construction of the functional dependence of @xmath39 , namely , this function was chosen as a product of the factors corresponding to the averaged amplitudes of the individual valence quarks .",
    "the strong interaction radius of the quarks is determined by its mass , @xmath43 the parameter @xmath44 was extracted from the experimental data for the differential cross - section of the elastic @xmath45-scattering . in the region of medium values of @xmath46 this model provides@xcite the familiar orear - type behavior : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is equal to the total mass of the constituent quarks in the two colliding protons , i.e. @xmath49 gev / c , and the value of parameter @xmath50 since from the experimental data @xmath51 mev and to reproduce the standard constituent quark masses the value of @xmath44 should be around 2 .",
    "the functions @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ un ] ) can be expressed through the functions @xmath53  the multiparticle analogs of the function @xmath13 @xcite in the polarized case .",
    "the set of the kinematical variables @xmath54 ( @xmath6 and @xmath1 for example ) describe the state of the produced pion .",
    "we assume that the shift @xmath55 can be connected with the radius of quark interaction @xmath56 , which is responsible for the quark transition flipping its spin , i.e. : @xmath57 asymmetry @xmath58 can be written in terms of the functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath13 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 obey the sum rule @xmath65 here @xmath66 stands for the mean multiplicity in the impact parameter representation .    with the above relation for the shift in the impact parameter due to the transition flipping quark spin the following expression for asymmetry @xmath67",
    "can be written @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath70 should be positive because @xmath71 .    in the model @xcite the function @xmath39",
    "is chosen to be a product of the averaged quark amplitudes under assumption of the the quasi - independence of valence constituent quark scattering in the self - consistent mean field .",
    "the function @xmath39 in a pure imaginary case for the elastic scattering amplitude , which we consider here for simplicity has been written in the following form @xmath72 where the factor @xmath73 increases at large values of @xmath5 like a power of energy : @xmath74^n,\\ ] ] @xmath48 is the total mass of @xmath75 constituent quarks with mass @xmath76 in the initial hadrons and parameter @xmath44 determines a universal scale for the quark interaction radius without flipping its spin , i.e. @xmath77 .    to evaluate asymmetry dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath1 the semiclassical correspondence between transverse momentum and impact parameter has been used . integrating by parts , we can rewrite the expression for the asymmetry in the form : @xmath78 ^ 3 } { \\int_0^\\infty bdb i_0(s , b,\\xi)/[1+\\tilde u(s , b)]^2},\\ ] ]    at small values of @xmath38 the values of @xmath13-matrix are large , and we can neglect unity in the denominators of the integrands .",
    "thus the ratio of the two integrals ( after integration by parts of nominator in eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) ) is of order of unity , i.e. the energy and @xmath1-independent behavior of asymmetry @xmath67 takes place at the values of transverse momentum @xmath79 : @xmath80 this flat transverse momentum dependence of asymmetry results from the similarity of the rescattering effects for the different spin states , i.e. spin - flip and spin - nonflip interactions undergo similar absorption at short distances and the relative magnitude of this absorption does not depend on energy .",
    "it can be considered as a one of the manifestations of the unitarity .",
    "the numerical value of polarization @xmath67 can be significant .",
    "indeed , there is no small factor in ( [ polllg ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath81 is the hadron interaction radius ( @xmath82 ) , the typical numerical falue of @xmath83 has been taken to be equal to 1 fm .",
    "thus , the typical value of @xmath84 is 0.1 gev / c and the eq .",
    "( [ polllg ] ) which is valid at @xmath79 , should be applicable in the region @xmath7 gev / c .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is of order @xmath85 fm on the basis of the model estimates @xcite . the radius of quark interaction @xmath56 responsible for the transition @xmath86 changing quark spin .",
    "the linear increase of asymmetry with @xmath6 follows from the above considerations which , of course , are approximate and valid at @xmath6 around unity .",
    "therefore , at smaller values of @xmath6 the linear dependence is distorted .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ polllg ] is valid in the region of large @xmath6 .",
    "the flat dependence of asymmetry on @xmath1 provided by this relation is consistent with the new data from rhic ( we have used data available at the largest values of @xmath6 due to approximation made in the model and discussed above ) @xcite ( cf .",
    "comparison with the data allows one to estimate the value of @xmath56 more precisely , namely @xmath87 fm .",
    "similar mechanism generates ssa in the inclusive production of charged pions .",
    "it should be noted that dependencies of ssa on @xmath1 consistent with the flat ones have also been observed at lower values of @xmath6 , namely , in the two regions @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the data demonstrate increase of ssa with @xmath6 . due to limitation of the model for the large @xmath6 region ,",
    "we have not used those data , but , in principle , the model is in agreement with them too . to be honest",
    ", one should not compare the predictions of the model which are valid for @xmath6 in the vicinity of unity with the experimental data wich have highest value of @xmath6 around 0.4 .",
    "however , the data demonstrate similar flat dependence on transverse momentum in the the rather wide range @xmath6 from 0.16 to 0.4 .",
    "we therefore assume that the similar dependence will be valid at @xmath6 values around unity and perform comparison with the experiment .",
    "it should be clarified , that the above agreement with the data has a qualitative value only and for the quantitative analysis the data at higher values of @xmath6 are required .    the mechanism of chiral quark fluctuation in the effective field with spin flip is suppressed compared to the direct elastic scattering of quarks and , therefore , it should not play a significant role e.g. in the reaction @xmath90 in the fragmentation region , but evidently it is not the case for the reaction @xmath91 .",
    "the above features can be observed experimentally : asymmetry @xmath58 is consistent with zero for proton production and significantly deviates from zero for the neutron production in the forward region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an important issue has been raised , namely a model when trying to explain spin asymmetries should simultaneously describe the data for the unpolarized inclusive cross - sections . in this approach with the effective degrees of freedom ",
    "constituent quarks and goldstone bosons  unpolarized inclusive cross",
    " section at high transverse momenta fllows a generic power - like dependencies on @xmath1 . at high @xmath1",
    "the power - like dependence @xmath92 with @xmath93 takes place .",
    "it originates from the singularity at zero impact parameter @xmath94 .",
    "the exponent @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath96dependence of the unpolarized inclusive cross ",
    "section is consistent with the respective data dependence on the transverse momentum ( fig .",
    "5 ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that prediction of the spin filtering mechanism @xcite on the flat @xmath1-dependence of single - spin asymmetries is consistent with the new experimental data from rhic .",
    "as it often happens , this interpretation is not unique .",
    "such flat dependence can result from finite size of a constituent quark and a presence of the orbital angular momentum of the current quarks residing inside the constituent one @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is based on the similar ideas as the spin filtering one but is , in principle , different and has no predictive power for @xmath6 dependence of ssa .",
    "thus , we would like to treat the seemingly flat @xmath1-dependence of ssa in favor of the spin filtering mechanism , while the presence of the internal orbital momentum in the structure of constituent quarks still remains to be an interesting option and can not be excluded at the moment ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we would like to stress again that the experimental data set @xcite is the preliminary one and we hope that the final data will show smaller error bars and allow one to provide a quantitative discrimination of the model predictions for ssa .",
