    "in the last decades , several algorithms have been developed to identify the atom in the molecule ( aim ) .",
    "for example the mulliken method @xcite relies on the attachment of basis functions to atomic centers ; natural population analysis @xcite relies on the analysis of blocks of the one - electron density matrix ( 1 dm ) expressed in some molecular orbital basis ; some other methods rely on the partitioning of the molecular electron density in aim parts .",
    "however , not all aim properties can be directly expressed in terms of the electron density .",
    "of course the density determines all the properties and there are even explicit formulas for them , but these formulas are often computationally impractical .",
    "a common example is the kinetic energy of an aim , which is directly computable from the full 1 dm @xmath0 , but not ( trivially ) from the electron density , the diagonal element of the 1 dm .    a widely adopted solution , which is also the most common recipe employed within the quantum theory of atoms in molecules ( qtaim ) @xcite , is to partition such molecular properties using the same atomic weight functions @xmath1 that are used to partition the molecular density .",
    "qtaim uses a zero flux condition of the electron density to define interatomic surfaces , resulting in nonoverlapping atomic regions .",
    "atomic energies are obtained by partitioning the kinetic energy over the atomic domains and using the virial ratio to construct the corresponding atomic potential energy .",
    "other approaches also rely on atomic regions to partition the molecular energy , but use them in a more general way to decompose the energy into one- and two - atom terms @xcite .",
    "recently , mandado et al . @xcite partitioned the hartree - fock energy in terms of the overlapping hirshfeld atoms .",
    "their scheme appears useful to investigate proton acidity , the anomeric effect and group transferability , it has also been used in studies of bonding and polarizability @xcite .",
    "however , partitioning of the molecular energy in atomic fragments can be ambiguous as it often relies on the introduction of an arbitrary number of partitionings of unity @xcite into the energy expressions . moreover",
    ", the exact place where the partition of unity is introduced in an expectation value expression can have an important influence on the resulting aim condensed values @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity is often circumvented by the convention to introduce the unity and its partitioning into weight functions ( @xmath2 ) before any operator @xcite .    to avoid these problems",
    ", we partition the hartree - fock energy starting from a partitioning of hartree - fock molecular 1 dm . at the hartree - fock level of theory",
    "the energy can be expressed solely and directly in terms of a ( partitioned ) molecular 1 dm .",
    "a partitioning of the hartree - fock molecular 1 dm therefore directly leads to a natural partitioning of the energy .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we introduced a double - atom partitioning scheme for the molecular 1 dm that is consistent with existing partitioning schemes for the molecular density . in the current work we use molecular 1 dm fragments from that scheme to calculate the energy terms naturally associated with these fragments .",
    "the strategy of this work is therefore to calculate `` properties of the molecular fragments '' , @xmath3 , instead of `` fragmenting molecular properties '' , @xmath4 .",
    "this is in line with the work of bultinck et al.@xcite for the derivative of the density function with respect to a change in the number of electrons .",
    "we also examine the correspondences and differences between both approaches .    from a practical point of view",
    ", a fragmentation of molecular properties requires that the expectation value integrals are computed numerically on a large spatial grid . in general",
    "there is no simple analytical expression for the atomic weight functions and these weight functions are often not well expressed in one - electron hilbert space .",
    "in contrast , molecular 1 dm fragments show a satisfying basis set convergence in one - electron hilbert space @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to calculate the atomic and interaction energies of the 1 dm fragments in one - electron hilbert space , avoiding cumbersome numerical integrations in @xmath5-space . as a consequence",
    ", we expect to find that significant computational advantages are a major asset of our current approach .",
    "we use the notation @xmath6 to specify the single - electron states in coordinate space , where @xmath7 represents the spin degrees of freedom . the one - electron density matrix ( 1 dm ) for an @xmath8-electron molecule with wave function @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 we restrict ourselves to molecules with a singlet ground state . in that case @xmath11 and the electron spin can be discarded . in a previous paper",
    "we introduced a double - atom partitioning scheme for the molecular spin - summed 1 dm @xcite , @xmath12 in terms of atomic ( @xmath13 ) and diatomic contributions ( @xmath14 ) , where a and b label atoms .",
    "the individual contributions are defined as @xmath15\\rho ( \\bm{r } , \\bm{r ' } ) ,      \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] with positive local weight functions @xmath16 obeying @xmath17    at the hartree - fock level the energy is expressed solely in terms of the 1 dm . therefore , the partitioning of the latter over the atoms in the molecule leads naturally to a corresponding partitioning of the hartree - fock energy .",
    "however , for a simple energy partitioning we require that ( 1 ) it is based on single - atom density matrices ( rather than double - atom density matrices ) and ( 2 ) the electron density of the atoms is local and positive definite . note that any single - atom density matrix @xmath18 unavoidably has bad localization properties ( in contrast to the double - atom density matrices ) @xcite , and therefore we restrict the requirement of locality and positive definiteness to the electron density , the diagonal element of the 1 dm .",
    "the latter requirement is needed to prevent the energy components to become unrealistically large on the chemical energy scale .",
    "when the single - atom density matrices are defined as @xmath19 it is clear that on the diagonal ( @xmath20 ) the following definition is obtained , @xmath21 that is familiar from existing partitioning schemes for the electron density ( with good localization properties ) .",
    "also the fundamental property @xmath22 is obeyed as a trivial consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "note that these single atom density matrices may not be n - representable , an issue that , however , does not stand in the way of obtaining integrated quantities such as energy contributions .    in order to define a computationally efficient energy partitioning scheme , we assume real wavefunctions and express the partitioned density matrices in the finite basis set used for the molecular calculation .",
    "e.g. , in the molecular hartree - fock basis set , the following spatial integrals @xmath23 that represent elements of the regular atomic overlap matrix ( aom ) , are sufficient to determine the single - atom 1 dm in this basis , @xmath24 the precise expressions for the density matrices are : @xmath25 where a simple sum rule @xmath26 is used to simplify the expression in eq .",
    "( [ dens1 ] ) .    in order to ensure that the single - atom density @xmath27 is local , it can be made to coincide with the aim density of some well - established density partitioning scheme like hirshfeld @xcite , iterative hirshfeld @xcite , iterated stockholder atoms @xcite or qtaim @xcite , @xmath28 in which the aim density is obtained by multiplying the molecular density @xmath29 with the characteristic weight function for that aim technique @xmath30 .",
    "one simply takes @xmath31 an alternative to eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , consisting of distributing the diatomic contributions in a weighted manner , was also investigated in @xcite , but will be discarded here because it gave inferior results .",
    "following the ideas behind the interacting quantum atoms ( iqa ) @xcite , but from the perspective of density matrix fragments in one - electron hilbert space , each single - atom 1 dm with elements @xmath32 constructed in section [ single - atom ] can be thought of as forming an atomic subsystem @xcite when combined with the nucleus on center a. the molecular energy can then be decomposed as the sum of the `` self - energies '' of the atomic subsystems and the interaction energies between them : @xmath33 at the closed - shell hartree - fock level , the self - energy of such an atomic subsystem corresponds to : @xmath34 where @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ definitions ] ) , @xmath36 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath37 is the nuclear charge on an atom a with nuclear coordinate @xmath38 . @xmath39 are two - electron integrals that are not anti - symmetrized .",
    "note that it is implied in eq .",
    "( [ selfenergy ] ) that the atomic subsystems are spin - averaged , consistent with eq.([singlet]-[eq2 ] ) .",
    "the atomic subsystems interact with each other , according to the following expressions : @xmath40 @xmath41 represents the total interaction energy of all subsystems within the molecule .",
    "@xmath42 quantifies all interactions between atom pairs in molecules , including the interaction between atom pairs that do not share a chemical bond .",
    "this quantity is also useful to assess the strength of the interactions in a ring structure .",
    "@xmath42 does not depend on the choice of reference atoms , it only depends on the aim .",
    "the localized character of the hirshfeld - i densities ensures that the promotion and interaction energies are within a reasonable range of values , although they are often significantly larger ( in absolute value ) than typical `` bond energies '' .      since it is well known that the molecular environment induces only relatively small changes in atomic energy @xcite , atomic energies are usually referenced to the energy of the isolated atoms .",
    "atoms within a molecular environment are slightly distorted compared to the isolated atoms .",
    "this implies that their energy , with respect to the hamiltonian of the isolated atoms , has increased .",
    "this energy increase is called the atomic promotion energy @xmath43 . when the atom in a molecule is identified with the atomic subsystem defined above , its promotion energy is the difference between the ( hartree - fock ) atomic self - energy @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ selfenergy ] ) and the hartree - fock energy @xmath45 of the isolated atom : @xmath46    the atomic promotion energies can be considered to result from three successive processes : first a charge transfer step that accounts for the fact that the aim has a different atomic charge from the isolated atom .",
    "@xmath47 classically , the reference for this step is the neutral isolated atom in its ground state @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 represents the charged isolated atom , and is approximated as the linearly interpolated value between the energies of the isolated atoms with an integer number of electrons @xmath50 . in principle , the hf energy as a function of the number of electrons n is a concave curve between the integers @xcite .",
    "the assumption that it is linear is based on the fact that this holds for the exact energies @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath49 computed as : @xmath51    the interpolated state @xmath49 is characterized by a value of @xmath52 ( where s is the spin angular momentum ) that does not always correspond to a singlet whereas the aim is always assumed to be spin averaged ( see eq .",
    "( [ singlet ] ) ) .",
    "we therefore introduce a second step that accounts for the spin averaging .",
    "it corresponds to the energy difference between on the one hand the isolated atom with interpolated charge and averaged spin @xmath53 and on the other hand @xmath49 , @xmath54 @xmath53 is obtained as the interpolated value between the energies of the spin - averaged isolated atoms with an integer number of electrons , @xmath55 and the @xmath56 are calculated from the following formula : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the spin - summed 1 dm of the isolated atom with n electrons .    in the third step",
    ", charge reorganization takes place which corresponds to the difference between the self- energy of the of the atomic 1 dm fragment and the energy of the isolated atom with interpolated charge and averaged spin , @xmath59 finally , the promotion energy is retrieved as the sum of three terms as shown below : @xmath60 although one may point out that there is some arbitrariness in the order chosen for the processes , the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ bornhaber ] ) might give a general idea about their relative importance .",
    "since the promotion and interaction energies depend on the aim definition , they are not directly observable .",
    "the sum of all promotion and interaction energies , i.e. the atomization energy @xmath61 of the molecule , can be compared to experiment : @xmath62 in order to get a quantity that is more in line with the chemical concept of a `` bond energy '' , it would be convenient to interpret the atomization of a molecule strictly in terms of atom pairs .",
    "therefore , the atomic promotion energies ( @xmath63 ) are attributed to the atom pairs ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 and hartree - fock bond energies are derived , @xmath66 that reproduce exactly the hartree - fock atomization energy @xmath67 these bond energies can be compared to average bond dissociation energies .",
    "in the introduction we already noted that the current approach to calculate self - energies and interaction energies for 1 dm fragments is unambiguous . that is not the case for the widely adopted approach to partition the molecular energy using numerical integration of the molecular integrals weighted by the atomic weight functions . in this section",
    "we explore the exemplary cases of two components of the atomic self - energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ selfenergy ] ) ) : the atom - condensed kinetic energy and the atom - condensed fock energy .",
    "the strategy adopted in the current paper is to calculate energy components of the molecular fragments , rather than to fragment the molecular energy . for the kinetic energy in particular",
    ", this can have important consequences .",
    "the kinetic energy t@xmath68 of the single - index atomic density matrix is calculated in eqs .",
    "( [ selfenergy]- [ definitions ] ) in a finite basis set , but the corresponding expression in @xmath5-space is : @xmath69 where the notation @xmath70 indicates that @xmath71 is replaced by @xmath5 after the action of @xmath72 on @xmath73 but before the integration is carried out .",

    "@xmath74 should give the same result as in eq .",

    "this is indeed fulfilled for the present formulation in terms of atomic density matrices , as follows directly from partial integration by generalizing a well known relationship for the kinetic energy of the molecular 1 dm , @xmath75 to its fragments .",
    "in contrast , the expression for the fragmentation of the molecular kinetic energy with hirshfeld - i weight functions clearly depends on the representation of the kinetic energy operator @xcite , since in general @xmath76 yields a result that differs from @xmath77 only in special cases , e.g. when qtaim weight functions are used , do eq .",
    "( [ eqtenfrag ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqtenfrag2 ] ) coincide .",
    "this shows that a naive fragmentation of the molecular energy by introducing weight functions in the molecular integrals is ambiguous by nature , in contrast to the fragmentation of the molecular 1 dm and the calculation of the associated energy components .",

    "<S> since the hartree - fock energy can be expressed solely in terms of the one - electron density matrix , the partitioning of the latter over the atoms in the molecule leads naturally to a corresponding partitioning of the hartree - fock energy . when the size of the molecule or the molecular basis set does not grow too large , the method shows considerable computational advantages compared to other approaches that require cumbersome numerical integration of the molecular energy integrals weighted by atomic weight functions . </S>"
