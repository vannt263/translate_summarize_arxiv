    "the capability of faithfully transferring information from one location to another is one of the main driving factors of the modern technological progress . as far as classical information is concerned , there is no limit , at least in principle , to reproduce an exact copy of the original message ; therefore the information transfer has to face somehow minor problems than those faced in the quantum realm .",
    "there , the no - cloning theorem  @xcite explicitly prohibits to make an exact copy of the quantum state on which the quantum information has been coded in .",
    "this has stimulated , over the last past decades , a large body of works on how to efficiently achieve quantum state transfer ( qst ) .    for short - haul transfers of the quantum state of a single qubit ( 1-qst ) ,",
    "the use of spin-@xmath0 chains , initially proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been largely investigated ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and ref .",
    "@xcite for an implementation with a cavity array ) .",
    "protocols based on time - dependent couplings  @xcite , fully engineered interactions  @xcite , ballistic transfer  @xcite , rabi - like oscillations  @xcite , just to name a few , have been shown to achieve high fidelity 1-qst , in addition to some additional tasks like routing of the quantum information to an on - demand location on a spin graph  @xcite .    recently , the same effort is being devoted to the case of multiqubit qst ( @xmath2qst ) , in which the state aimed at being transferred is made of @xmath3 qubits . in many cases ,",
    "the adopted strategies consist of extensions of 1-qst protocols and , as a consequence , the drawbacks and inconveniences they already presented for the 1-qst are , to some extent , even more amplified when it comes to the @xmath4-qst case .",
    "for example , the multi - rail scheme  @xcite requires the use of several quantum spin-@xmath0 chains and a complex encoding and decoding scheme of the quantum states ; employing linear chains made of spins of higher dimensionality reduces the number of chains to one , but still requires a repeated measurement process with consecutive single site operations  @xcite ; the fully - engineered chain ( eventually combined with the ballistic or rabi - like mechanism ) , as well as the uniformly coupled chain with specific conditions on its length , needs conditional quantum gates to be performed on the recipients of the quantum state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , simpler many qubits qst schemes would be quite appealing .    in the present paper ,",
    "we adopt a minimal engineering and intervention point of view , looking for a 2-qst protocol that does not need demanding operations to be performed , neither in the form of external end - operations on the spins nor to engineer the spin couplings .",
    "experimentally - friendly @xmath5-qst schemes are interesting in view of the fact that both the full modulation of the couplings may be unattainable ( depending on the physical system meant to perform the qst ) and that quantum operations , such as measurements and gates , are prone to errors which , in a realistic set - up , may fatally degrade the efficiency of the protocol .",
    "in addition , as the exchange of quantum information is meant to occur , for instance , between quantum processors , it is quite natural that qst of more than a single qubit has to be faced in order to fully exploit the potentialities of quantum computation .",
    "needless to say , also other fields relying on quantum information processing , such as cryptography and dense coding would widely benefit from efficient @xmath4-qst protocols  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s.fidelitygen ] , we obtain a general expression for the average fidelity of the quantum state transfer of two qubits coupled to an arbitrary total angular momentum conserving graph of spin-@xmath0 initialized in the fully polarized state ; in sec .",

    "@xcite , high - quality 2-qst can be achieved . finally , in sec .  [ s.concl ]",
    "some concluding remarks are reported together with a discussion on possible extensions of our idea .",
    "in this section we derive a general expression for the average fidelity of a 2-qubit quantum state transfer from a pair of senders to a pair of receivers , residing respectively on sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 of a lattice @xmath8 of arbitrary dimensionality .",

    "the hilbert space dimension of the @xmath4-th sector is clearly @xmath21 .",
    "our goal is to transfer the quantum state of two qubits located at sites @xmath12 and given by @xmath22 to the receivers spin , located at sites @xmath23 .",
    "the rest of the lattice , embodied by the quantum channel @xmath24 and the receivers @xmath23 , is initialized in the state @xmath25 .",

    "the fidelity between the state transferred to the receivers and the state encoded initially on the senders is given by  @xcite @xmath30    the quality of a qst protocol , however , can not be simply evaluated by considering the fidelity of the transfer of a single , specific input state ; in fact , a more appropriate figure of merit is given by the average qst - fidelity @xmath31 obtained by averaging over all possible input states .",

    "we give an instance of such a procedure and , at the same time , we propose a model that accomplishes a high - quality 2-qst .",
    "the results for the 2-qst scheme we propose in this section have to be compared with the average fidelity ( hereafter called fidelity ) we would obtain by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) or by means of universal quantum cloning machines ( uqcm ) . the use of these channels yields what is conventionally dubbed as classical fidelity and amounts to , respectively , @xmath38  @xcite and @xmath39  @xcite , where @xmath40 is the hilbert - space dimension of the state aimed to be transferred . for the case of 2 qubits",

    "because of the quadratic nature of the hamiltonian , the single particle spectrum is sufficient to describe the full dynamics . denoting by @xmath58 and @xmath59 the @xmath60-th energy eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector , the full hamiltonian operator acting on a @xmath61 dimensional hilbert space , is easily decomposed into a direct sum over all particle number - conserving invariant subspaces @xmath62 , where    @xmath63    with @xmath64 being the fermion vacuum .",

    "indeed the time @xmath134 is now linear in the magnetic field and hence 2-qst occurs faster w.r.t .",
    "chains of length @xmath74 .",
    "let us remind that a similar phenomenon takes place in 1-qst protocols where the sender and the receiver are weakly coupled to the chain either because of smaller bond strengths  @xcite or because of a strong magnetic field acting on barrier qubits  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in those cases the qst time for even- and odd - length chains too scales , respectively , quadratically and linearly with the perturbations intensity .     for the case of spin chains of length @xmath169 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "the time @xmath119 increases linearly with @xmath55 , although with slightly different coefficients depending on wether @xmath124 is divisible by @xmath179 or not . in the figure the two cases are exemplified by @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "( right ) transfer time @xmath119 for the case of spin chains of length @xmath169 with magnetic field @xmath182 as a function of @xmath124 .",

    "[ f.fmax ] , we summarize the main result of the two previous subsections , namely the possibility to transfer with high - fidelity an arbitrary quantum state of two qubits by means of a linear spin-@xmath0 chain with strong magnetic fields on the barrier qubits . it is shown that for @xmath74 , a fidelity close to unity can be achieved regardless of @xmath124 ( provided strong enough magnetic fields are applied at the barrier sites ) although in a time that increases quadratically with @xmath55 . for @xmath169 , instead ,",
    "the quality of the transfer depends on whether @xmath124 is divisible by 4 ( higher @xmath183 ) or not ( lower @xmath183 ) , but the transfer is achieved in a time that scales only linearly with both @xmath55 and @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless , the differences amongst all these cases fade away for @xmath184 , where all curves collapse .     obtained by choosing @xmath182 .",
    "the red points are the rabi - like 2-qst and the maximum does not depend on @xmath124 , the blue point are for @xmath169 and even @xmath124 performs better than odd @xmath124 . for @xmath185 , both of the curves converge to the @xmath74 case . ]    since the average fidelity is not _ identically _ one , one could imagine that there exist specific input states that are transferred with a relatively poor quality .",
    "this is not the case , and in order to dispel such a doubt , we evaluated also the worst case fidelity  @xcite and found that the minimum state - dependent fidelity , evaluated by means of eq .",
    "[ e.fidelity ] , remains close to the average one up to the fourth digit , i.e. @xmath186 .    to conclude this section we stress that the probability to find the excitations inside the quantum channel @xmath24 , evaluated by @xmath187 , is radically different depending on whether @xmath121 or not . in the former case it is of the order of @xmath89 because @xmath24 acts as a mere physical connector  @xcite entering the dynamics only virtually . on the contrary , when @xmath169 , two extended states with a non - negligible overlap on the senders and the receivers come into play , meaning that the excitations can be actually found inside the channel @xmath24 . as a consequence",
    ", the effect of a dissipative coupling of an environment eventually acting only on @xmath24 has a negligible influence only for the rabi - like qst whereas for the quasi - rabi - like one the quality could be severely degraded , especially for short chains . for long chains , on the other hand ,",
    "since the overlap with the extended state localized also on the edges scales as @xmath188 , the degrading effect becomes negligible . on the other hand , the presence of disorder in the couplings or in a magnetic field acting on the quantum channel @xmath24 should have a negligible influence too on the efficiency of the 2-qst protocol we are proposing here , regardless of @xmath124 , as long as the spatial distribution of the eigenvectors depicted in fig .",
    "[ f.local ] is not significantly affected  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we derived an expression for the average fidelity of the quantum state transfer of two qubits through a spin-@xmath0 chain , providing that the @xmath11-total angular momentum is conserved and all the spins are initially aligned .",
    "this general expression , relating the average fidelity explicitly to one- and two - particle transition amplitudes , may result useful in investigating the two qubit qst properties of a wide range of physical models displaying the above - mentioned characteristics .    furthermore , we discussed a specific case , obtained by extending a rabi - like protocol , widely adopted for qst of single qubits , to the non - trivial case of the qst of two qubits , where the senders and receivers pairs are located at each end of a one dimensional spin-@xmath0 chain with @xmath1-heisenberg type nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic fields on the two sites closest to the sender and receiver ( barrier qubits ) , allowed us to obtain a faithfully transfer for an arbitrary two - qubits quantum state .",
    "we characterized the quality of the 2-qst by using first - order degenerate perturbation theory ; thus providing , apart from a clear - cut physical interpretation of the multi - excitation dynamics yielding high - quality 2-qst , also an approximate analytical expression for the time transfer .",
    "the latter is found to increase linearly or quadratically with the magnetic field intensity @xmath55 depending on the spin chain length .",
    "moreover , we have verified that the worst - case fidelity of the qst remains almost unchanged with respect to the average one , i.e. , @xmath189 .",
    "two final comments are in order . since it is straightforward that the 4-dimensional hilbert space of the senders can be also employed to encode an @xmath190 qudit to be transferred to the receivers , the scheme we propose can be adapted to the transfer of qutrits ( qubits ) encoded in arbitrary three ( two ) orthogonal quantum states of the senders .",
    "finally , the question if the barrier scheme discussed here is useful in order to perform qst of an arbitrary number of qubits will be left to future investigations .",
