    "the semileptonic @xmath8 meson decays induced by the tree - level @xmath9  ( @xmath10 ) transition provide an ideal ground for testing the standard model  ( sm ) and probing possible hints of new physics  ( np ) .",
    "for instance , ( i ) such decays offer ways of extracting the magnitudes of the ckm matrix element @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the extractions from exclusive vs. inclusive semileptonic decays exhibit a long - standing @xmath13 discrepancy  @xcite ; ( ii ) the measurements of ratios @xmath14  @xmath15 reported by babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite collaborations exhibit significant deviations from the sm expectations at @xmath16 level  @xcite , which are the so - called `` @xmath17 puzzles '' .",
    "a lot of efforts have been made for possible solutions within various np models , for instance , new four fermion operators , two - higgs - doublet models , r - parity violating supersymmetry models , leptoquark models , alternative left - right symmetric model and so on  @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 mesons , some other hadrons , such as @xmath18 and @xmath0 , could also decay through @xmath19 transition at quark level , and therefore , these decay modes would play a similar role as semileptonic @xmath8 decays mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath20 meson with quantum number of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the partner of @xmath8 meson in the heavy - meson doublet of @xmath23 system  @xcite .",
    "its decay occurs mainly through the electromagnetic process @xmath24 , and the weak decay modes are generally very rare . until now",
    ", there is no available experimental information for @xmath20 weak decays due to the limited center - of - mass energy and integrated luminosity in the previous experiments of heavy flavor physics .",
    "fortunately , such situation is expected to be improved by the upcoming superkekb / belle - ii experiment  @xcite , which has started test operations and succeeded in circulating and storing beams in the electron and positron rings recently .",
    "for instance , using the target annual integrated luminosity @xmath25  @xcite , the cross section of @xmath26 production @xmath27  @xcite and the branching fractions of @xmath26 decays into @xmath0 final states  @xcite , one can find that about @xmath28 and @xmath29 samples could be collected per year , which implies that the @xmath30 decays with branching fractions @xmath31 are possible to be observed by belle - ii .",
    "in addition , the running lhc may also provide some experimental information for @xmath0 decays , such as @xmath32 decay analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the much large beauty production cross section of @xmath33 collision compared with @xmath34 collision  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the rapid development of heavy flavor physics experiments , the theoretical studies of @xmath0 weak decays , which could provide some useful suggestions and references for the measurements , are urgently required .",
    "recently , a few theoretical evaluations of @xmath0 weak decays have been done , for instance , the studies of the semileptonic @xmath35 decays within the qcd sum rules  @xcite , the pure leptonic @xmath36 and @xmath37 decays  @xcite , the impact of @xmath38 on @xmath39 decays  @xcite , and the nonleptonic @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) decays  @xcite . in this paper , we will pay attention to the charged @xmath43 transitions induced @xmath44  @xmath2 decays within the sm . especially , the @xmath45 decays are suppressed neither by ckm factors ( compared to other @xmath46 decays ) nor by loop factors , and thus expected to be observed with relatively large branching fractions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the theoretical framework and calculations of @xmath47 decays are presented in detail .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical results and discussion .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "within the sm , the quark - level @xmath48 ( @xmath10 and @xmath49 ) transitions occur through @xmath50-exchange and could be described by the effective low - scale @xmath51 hamiltonian @xmath52[\\bar{\\ell}\\gamma^{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_5)\\nu_{\\ell}]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is fermi coupling constant , and @xmath54 denotes the ckm matrix elements . with eq .",
    ", the square matrix element for @xmath55 decay can be written as @xmath56 in which , leptonic ( @xmath57 ) and hadronic ( @xmath58 ) tensors are built from the respective products of the lepton and hadron currents .",
    "following the strategy for evaluating @xmath59 decays  @xcite , eq .",
    "can be further expressed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 are polarization vectors of virtual @xmath62 boson , @xmath63 .",
    "one may note the point that the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 in eq .",
    "are lorentz invariant , and therefore can be evaluated in different reference frames . for convenience of evaluation , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "will be calculated in the @xmath0-meson rest frame and the virtual @xmath62 rest frame  ( or @xmath68 center - of - mass frame ) , respectively .      before the further evaluation",
    ", we would like to clarify some conventions and definitions for kinematics of @xmath55 decays used in this paper .    in the rest frame of @xmath0-meson with daughter @xmath69-meson moving in the positive @xmath70-direction , the momenta of particles @xmath0 , @xmath69 and virtual @xmath62 could be written respectively as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 with function @xmath74 and @xmath75 being the momentum transfer squared bounded at @xmath76 . for the four polarization vectors of virtual @xmath62 , @xmath77 , one can conveniently choose  @xcite @xmath78 meanwhile , the polarization vectors of initial @xmath0-meson could be written as @xmath79    turning to the @xmath68 center - of - mass frame , the four momenta of lepton and antineutrino are given as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the energy and the magnitude of the three - momentum of the charged lepton , respectively , given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; and @xmath85 is the angle between the @xmath69 and @xmath86 three - momenta . in this reference frame , the polarization vectors of virtual @xmath62 take the form @xmath87      for @xmath55 decay , the hadronic helicity amplitude @xmath89 defined by @xmath90 describes the decay of three helicity states of @xmath0 meson into a pseudo - scalar @xmath69 meson and the four helicity states of virtual @xmath62 . in eq .  , @xmath91 represents hadronic matrix elements of the vector and axial - vector currents within the sm . for @xmath92 transition ,",

    "one may note that the non - diagonal interference contribution appears between the states of @xmath111 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath112 , but it has no contributions to the differential decay rate @xmath113 after integrating over @xmath114 , which can be seen from the following eq .  .",

    "are the leptonic helicity amplitudes in the @xmath68 center - of - mass frame , and given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 . the cases @xmath118 and @xmath119 are referred to as the non - flip and flip transitions , respectively . taking the exact forms of the spinors and polarization vectors , we finally obtain two nonvanishing contributions latexmath:[\\ ] ] respectively . in eq .",
    ", the polarized differential decay rates @xmath135/dq^2 $ ] are obtained after integration over @xmath125 of doubly differential ones given by eqs .   and  .",
    "explicitly , we obtain @xmath136 for @xmath137 , again using eqs .   and   and summing over the lepton helicity , we arrive at the explicit expression @xmath138    the lepton spin asymmetry @xmath139 is very sensitive to the np corrections , and therefore , has been widely studied in @xmath140 decays within various np scenarios .",
    "however , unfortunately , the lepton polarization can not be measured directly in the high energy experiments due to the lack of effective technology and method .",
    "for the case of @xmath141 lepton , its polarization could be determined in principle through analyzing the full angular distribution of @xmath141 subsequent decay , but it is not very easy . moreover ,",
    "such way is not suitable for the case of light leptons  ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "it is hoped that the theoretical researches on @xmath139 could motivate the development of the experimental technology and approach .",
    "before presenting our predictions for @xmath55 decays , we would like to clarify the input parameters used in our numerical evaluations .",
    "for the ckm matrix elements , we use the fitted results @xmath144 and @xmath145 given by ckmfitter group  @xcite . for the well - known fermi coupling constant @xmath53 and the masses of mesons and leptons ,",
    "we take the averaged values given by pdg  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the branching fractions , the total decay widths ( or lifetimes ) @xmath146 are essential . due to the facts that there is no available experimental and theoretical information for @xmath147 at present and the electromagnetic processes @xmath148 dominate the decays of @xmath0 mesons , we take the approximation @xmath149 in our evaluations of branching fraction .",
    "the theoretical predictions on @xmath150 have been given in many different theoretical models  @xcite .",

    "tab : bstar2p ] , we summarize the predictions of branching fractions , in which the three theoretical errors are caused by the uncertainties of form factors , ckm factors and @xmath154 , respectively . for the other @xmath75-integrated observables @xmath155  ( @xmath156 ) and @xmath157 ,",
    "the predictions are given in table  [ tab : obs ] , in which the theoretical uncertainties are caused by the form factors only . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dg ] and [ fig : dobs ] , the @xmath75-dependence of differential decay rates @xmath158 and @xmath155 , @xmath157 are shown , respectively . the following are some discussions :    1 .   compared with @xmath159 decays ,",
    "@xmath160 decays are suppressed by both an additional factor @xmath161 and the relatively small form factors .",
    "therefore , the branching fractions of @xmath160 decays are expected to be much smaller than the ones of corresponding @xmath159 decays by a factor of @xmath162 , which can be seen from table  [ tab : bstar2p ] . + in addition , from table  [ tab : bstar2p ] , it could also be found that @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath164 @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath106 @xmath164 @xmath168 @xmath164 @xmath169 , which is mainly attributed to the total decay widths @xmath146 illustrated by eqs .  , and .",
    "2 .   in table  [",
    "tab : bstar2p ] , one may find that @xmath170 , which implies that @xmath160 decays are hardly to be observed by belle - ii .",
    "however , fortunately , all of @xmath171 decay modes are in the scope of superkekb / belle - ii experiment due to @xmath172 , in which @xmath173 decay has the largest branching fraction of the order @xmath6 @xmath7 , and therefore , should be sought for with priority and firstly observed .",
    "+ moreover , @xmath171 decay modes are also expected to be measured by lhc experiments , which can be seen from the following rough analysis . here , we take the possible measurement of @xmath174 decay at lhcb as an example .",
    "firstly , it is expected that about @xmath175 @xmath176 decay events will be found after lhcb upgrade due to the facts that ( i ) using the data corresponding to integrated luminosities of @xmath177 and @xmath178 collected at @xmath33 center - of - mass energy @xmath179 and @xmath180 , respectively , @xmath181 @xmath182 decay events have been found by lhcb collaboration  @xcite ; ( ii ) after high - luminosity upgrade , a data sample of @xmath183 will be collected by lhcb collaboration at a much higher @xmath184 , which will results in a further enhancement of @xmath185 production by a factor about 2  @xcite .",
    "secondly , one can assume that the most of @xmath8 mesons detected at lhc are mainly produced through @xmath148 decay because @xmath0 mesons are often produced by about 3 times more than the @xmath8 mesons , which has been confirmed by the measurements at @xmath186 peak by lep  @xcite .",
    "finally , further taking @xmath187 into account , one may estimate that about @xmath188 @xmath174 events could be observed by lhcb .",
    "in addition , if one take @xmath189 instead of @xmath176 as a reference and revisit the estimation above , it can be found that about @xmath190 @xmath174 decay events are expected to be observed in the high - luminosity lhc era .",
    "recalling the @xmath191 decays , the known `` @xmath17 puzzles '' provide possible hints towards np , especially the one of lepton flavor ( universality ) violation .",
    "if it is the truth , the corresponding np corrections should also affect @xmath192 decays , and therefore , the future measurements for @xmath193 should significantly deviate from the sm results .",
    "otherwise , the np models providing solutions to `` @xmath17 puzzles '' will suffer a serious challenge from @xmath193 .",
    "so , the future measurements of @xmath193 will play an important role for testing the sm and the various np models .",
    "+ to distinguish the possible np hints , it will become important to control the theoretical uncertainties as well as possible . from our predictions for @xmath193",
    "given in table  [ tab : obs ] , as expected , one may find that the uncertainty caused by the hadronic factors is significantly reduced compared to the decay rates .",
    "moreover , when the range of @xmath75 integration is the same in the numerator and the denominator of @xmath194 , the cancellation of the nonperturbative error further improves , allowing for more precise predictions of the ratio of partial rates  @xcite .",
    "numerically , for instance , choosing the @xmath75 integration range @xmath195 $ ] for both numerator and denominator , we get @xmath196 which could be measured with a lower cut on @xmath75 . in addition , the @xmath75-dependences of @xmath193 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dobs ] ( a ) and ( b ) , which , once measured , would present a much stricter test for the sm and np .",
    "4 .   for the lepton spin asymmetry and the forward - backward asymmetry ,",
    "our numerical results are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "similar to @xmath193 , because of the cancellation of the hadronic errors between numerator and denominator , the theoretical uncertainties are significantly small compared with the branching fraction .",
    "regarding their differential distributions , which are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dobs ] ( c ) and ( d ) , a characteristic feature is the zero - crossing point , which is usually used to distinguish the np effects from the sm , or different np scenarios .",
    "numerically , we get that @xmath197 and @xmath137 cross the zero point respectively at @xmath198 and @xmath199 for @xmath200 , and @xmath201 and @xmath202 for @xmath203 .",
    "the @xmath0 weak decays are legal within the standard model , although their branching ratios are tiny compared with the electromagnetic decays . in this paper , motivated by abundant @xmath0 data samples at high - luminosity heavy - flavor experiments in the future , we have studied the tree - dominated semileptonic @xmath1 ( @xmath204 and @xmath49 ) decays within the standard model .",
