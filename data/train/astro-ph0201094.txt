    "at a redshift of @xmath3 the intergalactic medium ( igm ) recombined and remained neutral until the first sources of ionizing radiation formed . while the distribution and evolution of these sources are unknown , the overall process of igm reionization is fairly well understood , and can be divided into three phases .",
    "first , individual hii regions developed around the sources .",
    "then , these ionized regions grew in number and size until they overlapped , producing a sudden increase of the photon mean free path . finally , when all underdense regions and voids were completely ionized , photons penetrated into overdense clumps and filaments , bringing the reionization process to completion at a `` reionization redshift . ''",
    "it is clear that the mystery of the nature and evolution of the ionizing sources is intimately tied with the time scale over which these phases took place .",
    "thus there is a great deal of physical information that could be gathered if the reionization redshift , @xmath4 , and its duration , @xmath5 , can be firmly established .",
    "apart from the study of the ( hi and heii ) gunn - peterson effect , which has not yet yielded conclusive results ( becker 2001 ; gnedin 2001 ; theuns 2001 ) , measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have the greatest potential for constraining these important quantities ( griffiths 1999 ) .",
    "the scattering of cmb photons by free electrons damps the angular power spectrum of primary anisotropies by a factor of @xmath6 for large angular multipoles @xmath7 ( tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ) , where @xmath8 is the thomson optical depth . using the currently available data , consistency with the lack of gunn - peterson trough and with the observed peak in the angular power spectrum at @xmath9 ( de bernardis 2000 ; hanany 2000 ; padin 2001 ) is able to constrain @xmath10 ( de bernardis 1997 ; griffiths 1999 ; tegmark 2001 ; griffiths & liddle 2001 ) , although these results are somewhat dependent on the cosmological model assumed .",
    "much better constraints are expected from polarization studies to be carried out by future satellites such as _ sport _ and _",
    "planck_.    a second method of quantifying reionization is to examine @xmath4 , and several recent studies have attempted to use the cmb to derive this redshift directly , using codes that assume a sudden epoch of reionization ( e.g , hu 95 ; seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) . for example , schmalzing ( 2000 ) use _ maxima _ data in combination with cosmological parameters from independent measurements of big bang nucleosynthesis and x - ray cluster data to constrain @xmath4 . by performing a @xmath11 analysis , they conclude that @xmath12 at the 68% ( 95% ) confidence level . similarly , naselsky ( 2001 ) , in addition to providing support to schmalzing results , showed that polarization spectra are very sensitive to the reionization redshift .",
    "an important caveat is implicit in these applications however , namely the assumption of prompt reionization . while taking @xmath13 is a reasonable first step ,",
    "more detailed simulations show that this approach paints a picture of reionization in only the broadest of strokes .",
    "this is particularly true as the onset of reionization raises the overall temperature of the igm , suppressing the further formation of objects that are too weakly bound gravitationally to overcome the drastic increase in thermal pressure ( barkana & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "thus recent numerical simulations of reionization ( ciardi 2000 , hereafter cfgj ; bruscoli 2000 ; gnedin 2000 ; benson 2000 ) have shown that the evolution of the mean ionization fraction is slow , has a nonlinear dependence on redshift , and occurs in an extremely patchy manner .",
    "all of these details may considerably affect the determination of @xmath4 .    in this paper , we aim to clarify the effects of realistic reionization scenarios on the observables typically used to examine the reionization epoch . to this end",
    "we have modified the most heavily relied on theoretical code for computing cmb fluctuations , cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) , to allow the treatment of such reionization histories , helping to clarify the best approach in trying to quantify and define the epoch of reionization .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss numerical models of reionization and how these have been incorporated into the cmbfast code . in ",
    "3 we apply these techniques to study the impact of these models on the temperature and polarization spectrum of the cmb , and conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "to assess the effects of more physical reionization histories on the determination of @xmath4 , we have modified the boltzmann code cmbfast such that the redshift evolution of the volume - averaged mean hydrogen ionization fraction , @xmath14 , can be specified , reading in data from more detailed simulations of reionization .",
    "our modified version of cmbfast is then able to consider three types of reionization histories : ( _ i _ ) prompt reionization models in which the total optical depth , @xmath8 , is chosen ( _ ii _ ) prompt models in which the reionization redshift , @xmath15 , is fixed , and ( _ iii _ ) models in which @xmath14 is read from an external file .    as in bruscoli ( 2000 )",
    ", we consider a set of reionization simulations studied in cfgj , which model reionization from stellar sources , including population iii objects .",
    "these simulations were developed in a critical density cdm universe with cosmological parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the rms variation of density perturbations at the @xmath22 comoving mpc length scale , and @xmath23 is the baryonic density in units of the critical density ) but span a large range of model parameters , and thus are suitable for drawing conclusions as to the effect of extended reionization in more general cosmologies .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sources and ionized regions at various cosmic epochs and the overall evolution of @xmath14 are obtained from high - resolution cosmological simulations within a periodic box of comoving length @xmath24 mpc .",
    "the source properties are calculated taking into account a self - consistent treatment of both radiative feedback from ionizing and h@xmath25photodissociating photons and stellar feedback regulated by supernovae from massive stars .",
    "there are two main free parameters in the simulations : the fraction of total baryons converted into stars , @xmath26 , and the escape fraction of ionizing photons from a given galaxy , @xmath27 .",
    "a critical discussion of these parameters is given in cfgj , and here we examine four different models , fixing ( @xmath28 ) in run a , ( 0.004 , 0.2 ) in run b , ( 0.15 , 0.2 ) in run c , and ( 0.012 , 0.1 ) in run d. as run a , in which @xmath29 , gives the best agreement between the derived evolution of the cosmic star formation rate and observations at @xmath30 ( steidel 1998 , cfgj ) , we choose this as our fiducial model , and rely on runs @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 to study the effects of model uncertainties on our conclusions .",
    "equipped with this more general tool , we now quantitatively contrast the prompt reionization @xmath34 with the one derived from the simulations , @xmath35 .",
    "as cmbfast can be run either by assigning @xmath4 or @xmath8 , we are able to examine both these cases separately .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the redshift evolution of the hydrogen ionization fraction and the thomson optical depth for the prompt and simulated cases , choosing in the prompt case the same value of @xmath36 as deduced from run a. in this plot , the smoother , nonlinear increase of @xmath35 is evident , with @xmath37 .",
    "note also that the optical depth for the two reionization histories are quite different , and that @xmath38 for run a and @xmath39 for prompt reionization .",
    "if we define the discrepancy between the prompt and simulated visibility functions @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath40 is the probability that a photon reaching the observer last scattered in the redshift range @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then we find that @xmath44 for a large range of redshifts between recombination and the beginning of reionization ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the most important comparison between the prompt and fiducial cases , however , is made in terms of the different resulting cmb temperature and polarization angular power spectra , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as these are the observable quantities .",
    "these are shown in the upper left panel of fig .  2 , in which differences are particularly evident in the polarization spectra , which are more sensitive to the reionization history .",
    "reionization introduces a characteristic bump in the lower multipoles ( @xmath48 ) that tends to shift to higher @xmath49 s when @xmath8 is increased .",
    "the amplitude of the bump in the @xmath47 spectrum decreases with @xmath8 and therefore the signal is weaker for the prompt reionization case .",
    "in particular the bump amplitude in the angular spectrum @xmath47 is roughly proportional to @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) , while its position scales as @xmath52 ( zaldarriaga 1997 ; fabbri 1999 ) .    to highlight these differences , we plot the normalized discrepancy of temperature and polarization angular spectra [ defined analogously to eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] between the models in the lower left panel . here",
    "find that @xmath53 while , around @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "these results make it clear that although the prompt and simulated reionization histories share the same value of @xmath4 , they produce noticeably different angular power spectra , and thus correct constraints on the reionization redshift can not be obtained by equating @xmath4 in the prompt and simulated runs .",
    "an alternative approach is to compare our fiducial run with a prompt model that differs in its @xmath4 but has the same thomson optical depth , @xmath56 .",
    "this results in a value for the prompt reionization redshift of @xmath57 .",
    "note that this value is much larger than the simulated redshift of reionization @xmath58 , and corresponds to the redshift at which the simulated ionization fraction is only @xmath59 .",
    "comparing these two runs we find , however , that the discrepancy between the two visibility functions is only @xmath60 this small change in the visibility function results in an equally small change in the observed cmb anisotropies .",
    "this can be seen on the top right panel of in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in which the angular power spectra are almost indistinguishable .",
    "indeed , the fractional discrepancy between these runs is only @xmath61 and @xmath62 as shown in the bottom right panel in this figure .",
    "thus the two different reionization models produce comparable angular power spectra if @xmath8 is specified rather than @xmath4 .",
    "in fact if we try to recover the reionization redshift from the standard formula @xmath63 ( peebles 1993 , tegmark _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) we get @xmath64 , again a redshift at which @xmath65 . it is clear then that by analyzing cmb power spectra using a prompt model , one can draw reasonable conclusions as to the overall thomson optical depth , whereas the reionization redshift is much more uncertain .      in order to quantify the difference between the fiducial model and the prompt model with the same optical depth further , we plot in fig.[fig3 ] the quantity @xmath66 as a function of the multipole number",
    "@xmath67 assuming full sky coverage , @xmath68 .",
    "for multipole values greater than 100 , @xmath11 exceeds unity , the value corresponding to the cosmic variance error of @xmath69 .",
    "this means that one can find a statistically significant difference between the prompt and fiducial models only by looking at angular multipoles with @xmath70 however , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we saw that the largest differences between the two histories occur at lower multipole values ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus although these reionization histories are considerably different , it is almost impossible to discriminate between them observationally .",
    "finally , we extend our analysis to the runs b , c , and d of cfgj , comparing them with prompt runs with equal values of @xmath72 . these results are summarized in table 1 . as in run",
    "a , the values of @xmath73 found for these models correspond to times at which @xmath59 , when the igm was in the midst of changing from a neutral state to an ionized one .",
    "is is clear from this table that it is not possible to put a constraint on the reionization redshift directly from cmbfast .",
    "in fact , as can be easily seen in table 1 , the differences between @xmath74 and @xmath73 can not be easily parameterized because they depend on several effects that influence the duration @xmath75 of the reionization process .",
    "these effects include radiative and stellar feedbacks , the star formation efficiency , the photon escape fraction , the spatial and mass distribution of the ionizing sources , and even the clumpiness of igm , which is beyond the scope of the cfgj simulations .",
    "we have conducted a number of checks and convergence tests to assess the robustness of our approach .",
    "our first check was to examine the overall , numerical value of the optical depth , which differs slightly from the input value due to the finite integration time step .",
    "here we found that the output @xmath8s differ by less than @xmath76 from the specified values .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 times smaller than the actual difference between the simulated and prompt runs .",
    "next , we carried out a series of convergence tests , to ascertain the effects of @xmath79-mode sampling on our results . here",
    "we restrict our tests to run a for which we increased the @xmath79 resolution by @xmath80 a comparison between the original and resampled simulated runs showed that at most angular scales @xmath81 and @xmath82 are within @xmath83 ; larger differences ( up to @xmath84 ) are found at higher multipole numbers ( @xmath85 ) . comparing the resampled run a with a resampled prompt run with equal input optical depth , we found @xmath81 and @xmath82 values that were virtually indistinguishable from those obtained with low @xmath79 resolution runs .",
    "finally , we examined the effect of time sampling at both @xmath79 resolutions , comparing two prompt runs with equal optical depth and @xmath79 resolution , but forcing one of them to the same time step as in simulated run a. again , we found @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath86 , far smaller than the discrepancies between the prompt and simulated runs .",
    "one of the first stages of nonlinear structure formation , reionization marked an important transition from a dark and relatively simple universe to one filled with a dazzling array of stars , galaxies , quasars , and other nonlinear objects .",
    "and although one of our best probes of this transition is through the measurement of cmb fluctuations , the process of reionization itself is much more dependent on the complicated astrophysical issues important at low redshifts than the linear issues important at @xmath87    in this work , we have explored this transition , quantifying the impact of realistic scenarios of reionization on the angular power spectrum of the comic microwave background .",
    "while standard estimates assume prompt reionization , we have considered instead a range of simulated models , each with a prolonged reionization epoch .",
    "we find that equating the redshift of full igm ionization between these simulations and models that assume instantaneous reionization leads to widely discrepant temperature and polarization spectra . on the other hand , equating prompt and extended models with the same overall optical depth",
    "leads to differences in anisotropies that are nearly undetectable . in this case",
    "the redshift of complete ionization is lost in the complicated details of the phase transition , and comparisons yield @xmath4 values corresponding to roughly the point of 50% ionization in the simulations , although even this value is model dependent .",
    "it is clear then that while @xmath4 is useful as schematic tool , it is the total optical depth that is most accurate in providing a definition of the reionization epoch ."
