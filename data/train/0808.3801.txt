    ", we explain the basic idea of novotny s method .",
    "novotny s method allows us to construct a cluster with an arbitrary number of spins ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "as indicated , the basic structure of the cluster is one - dimensional .",
    "the dimensionality is lifted to @xmath25 by the bridges over the @xmath26-th - neighbor pairs . because the basic structure is one - dimensional , we are able to construct a cluster with an arbitrary ( integral ) number of spins @xmath12 ( @xmath27 )",
    "; note that naively , the number of spins is restricted within @xmath28 in @xmath25 .",
    "we formulate the above idea explicitly .",
    "we propose the following expression @xmath29 for the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1 model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the component @xmath30 describes the @xmath1 ( plaquette ) interaction over the @xmath31-th neighbor pairs ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . because the quantum @xmath1 interaction , @xmath32 , is an off - diagonal one , we need to develop an off - diagonal version of novotny s method .",
    "we propose the following expression @xmath33 this formula serves as a basis of the off - diagonal novotny method .",
    "the symbol @xmath34 denotes the translation operator by one lattice spacing ; @xmath35 ( we impose the periodic boundary condition , @xmath36 . ) here , the base @xmath37 diagonalizes the @xmath38 operators ; namely , it satisfies @xmath39 for each @xmath40 . the insertions of the operators @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ h_xy ] ) introduce the @xmath31-th neighbor interaction along the alignment of spins @xmath42 ; symbolically , the operator @xmath43 may be written as @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , as for @xmath45 , we adopt the conventional idea based on the diagonal novotny method @xcite .",
    "that is , its diagonal elements @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 with the four - spin interaction @xmath48 similarly , the insertion of @xmath49 introduces the @xmath31-th neighbor interaction .",
    "however , in the diagonal scheme ( [ h_box ] ) , one operation of @xmath49 suffices ; note that in the off - diagonal formalism ( [ h_xy ] ) , two operations @xmath41 are required . because each operation @xmath41 requires huge computational effort",
    ", the off - diagonal scheme is computationally demanding .",
    "afterward , we provide a number of formulae useful for the practical implementation of the algorithm .",
    "the above formulae complete the formal basis of our simulation scheme .",
    "aiming to improve the simulation result , we implement the following symmetrization technique @xcite . that is , we symmetrize the component @xmath50 by replacing it with @xmath51 this replacement restores the symmetry between the ascending , @xmath52 , and the descending , @xmath53 , directions completely .",
    "last , we provide a number of formulae that may be useful in the practical implementation of the algorithm .",
    "we utilize the translationally invariant bases @xmath54 , which diagonalize the operator @xmath34 ; @xmath55 here , the wave number @xmath56 runs over a brillouin zone @xmath57 ( @xmath58 : integer ) , and the index @xmath59 specifies the state within the subspace @xmath56",
    ". as anticipated , the bases @xmath60 are useful to obtain an explicit representation of the formulae mentioned above .",
    "for instance , the first term of the formula ( [ h_xy ] ) is represented by @xmath61 in terms of the frame @xmath62 . because the parameter @xmath31 is , in general , an irrational number , the oscillating factor @xmath63 is incommensurate with respect to the lattice periodicity .",
    "hence , the intermediate summation @xmath64 has to be treated carefully ; namely , each brillouin zone @xmath65 is no longer equivalent .",

    "( similarly , we obtain an explicit representation for @xmath45 via the conventional novotny method @xcite . )",
    "provided that the explicit matrix elements of @xmath50 are at hand , we are able to perform the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_novotny ] ) . the results are shown in the next section .",

    "first , we consider the abscissa scale @xmath85 utilized in fig .",

    "naively , the scaling theory predicts that dominant corrections to @xmath77 should scale like @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite . on one hand , in our simulation , such dominant corrections",
