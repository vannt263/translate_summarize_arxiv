    "since the discovery of heat engines people were struggling to optimize their performance @xcite",
    ". one of the first results in the field was due to sadi carnot @xcite and rudolf clausius @xcite .",
    "they showed that the maximum efficiency attainable by any heat engine operating between the hot reservoir at the temperature @xmath0 and the cold one at the temperature @xmath1 is given by the carnot efficiency @xmath2 .",
    "alas their result was of limited practical importance for the corresponding heat engine must work reversibly and thus its output power is zero .",
    "optimization of the power of _ irreversible _ carnot cycles working under finite - time conditions turned out to be much more practical .",
    "it was pioneered by novikov @xcite , chambadal @xcite and later by curzon and ahlborn @xcite .",
    "the obtained result @xmath3 for the efficiency at maximum power ( emp ) seemingly exhibits the same degree of generality as the carnot s formula and also it describes well the efficiency of some actual thermal plants @xcite .",
    "although it turned out that @xmath4 is not a universal result , neither it represents an upper or lower bound for the emp @xcite , its close agreement with emp for several model systems @xcite ignited search for universalities in performance of heat engines .    for thermochemical engines it was shown that the form of the emp @xcite is controlled by the symmetries of the underlying dynamics ( see also @xcite for a similar study , but with finite - sized reservoirs ) . this result was further precised @xcite and recently a similar argumentation was successfully used for general thermodynamic devices @xcite .",
    "further universalities were obtained for the class of heat engines working in the regime of `` low dissipation '' @xcite , where the work dissipated during the isothermal branches of the carnot cycle grows in inverse proportion to the duration of these branches .",
    "namely a general expression for the emp for these engines has been published @xcite and subsequently lower and upper bounds on the emp were derived @xcite .",
    "all these results have been confirmed within a minimally nonlinear irreversible thermodynamics framework @xcite .",
    "another universal result recently appeared in the realm of brownian motors @xcite .",
    "engines so small that their output work and input heat become stochastic due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the ratio of these variables yields the efficiency which is thus itself random variable .",
    "large deviation form of the corresponding probability distribution exhibits the following universal features @xcite : ( i ) the most probable value of efficiency corresponds to its traditional definition using averages of work and heat , ( ii ) in case of time - reversal symmetric driving the least probable value of efficiency equals to @xmath5 .    in the present paper",
    "we reveal a new universality in optimization of _ trade - off between power and efficiency _ for low - dissipation carnot cycles @xcite . as our main result",
    ", we show that any trade - off measure expressible in terms of efficiency and the ratio of power to its maximum value exhibits the same degree of universality as the emp ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : tradeoff ] ) .",
    "consequently , for many systems these trade - off measures can be optimized independently of most details of the dynamics and of the coupling to thermal reservoirs .",
    "investigation of the trade - off between power and efficiency is immensely important for engineering practice , where not only powerful , but also economical devices should be developed .",
    "indeed , it was already highlighted @xcite that actual thermal plants and heat engines should not work at the maximum power , where the corresponding efficiency can be relatively small , but rather in a regime with slightly smaller power and considerably larger efficiency .",
    "our results strongly support these findings .",
    "examples of the low - dissipation carnot cycles are brownian motors based on two - level quantum systems @xcite or on driven overdamped systems @xcite , given that the used driving minimizes the work dissipated during the isothermal branches and that all thermodynamic variables are defined in the traditional manner , i.e. , via averages .",
    "we illustrate our results using carnot cycles based on an overdamped particle diffusing in an externally controlled confining potential . due to the recent advances in micromanipulation techniques @xcite , such engines",
    "were already realized experimentally @xcite and hence are of vital theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the diffusion - based heat engines and standard thermodynamic variables used to characterize their performance @xcite . the scheme @xcite for minimization of the work dissipated during the isothermal branches which leads to the low - dissipation behavior is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : max_eta ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : maxp ] , we review the results @xcite concerning the emp for low - dissipation carnot cycles . in the both sections we discuss consequences of the optimisation procedure on specific model systems .",
    "our main conclusions are : ( i ) under the restrictions of the optimization procedure , the protocol which minimizes the dissipation yields , at the same time , the maximum power and efficiency .",
    "( ii ) when the exact optimal protocol can not be obtained , a numerical optimization within a certain class of `` test '' protocols yields performance comparable to that of the optimal protocol .",
    "( iii ) the scheme for minimization of the work dissipated during the isothermal branches leads to the low - dissipation behavior only in case the optimization procedure has enough freedom to modify the potential .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : tradeoff ] we utilize the findings on the emp reviewed in sec .  [ sec : maxp ] to demonstrate the universality in the trade - off between power and efficiency .",
    "as particular examples we optimize two specific trade - off measures .",
    "the first one ( [ eq : tradeoff ] ) is suitable for finding optimal efficiency for a given output power .",
    "the results of the optimization procedure are illustrated on the model of log - harmonic potential introduced in secs .",
    "[ sec : model]-[sec : max_eta ] .",
    "the performed optimization indeed shows that engines operating near maximum power exhibit only slightly smaller power than the maximal one , but , at the same time , work with considerably larger efficiency than the emp . within the second example we derive universal bounds ( [ eq : boundsmv ] ) on the efficiency at maximum trade - off ( [ eq : lambda ] ) given by the product of power and efficiency . by comparison with data from actual nuclear power plants",
    "these bounds give promising results .",
    "induce the periodic response of the pdf to find the particle at time @xmath6 at position @xmath7 ( filled brown curve . ) ]    consider the carnot - like model @xcite sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle ] .",
    "the working medium of the heat engine is an overdamped particle diffusing in an externally driven confining potential .",
    "both the potential , @xmath8 , and the bath temperature , @xmath9 , are periodically altered .",
    "the cycle consists of two isotherms ( branches i and iii ) and two adiabats ( branches ii and iv ) .",
    "state of the engine is described by the probability density function ( pdf ) to find the particle at time @xmath6 at position @xmath7 . under the time - periodic driving the engine will eventually attain a time - periodic steady state , the so called limit cycle .",
    "the corresponding pdf @xmath10 follows from the fokker - planck equation @xmath11   \\right\\}p(x , t)\\ , , \\label{eq : current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] supplemented by the condition @xmath12 here @xmath13 stands for the mobility , which is assumed to depend on temperature , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath15 denotes the probability current and @xmath16 is the duration of one operational cycle of the engine .    in the following subsections [ subs : iia ] and",
    "[ subs : iib ] we will specify the individual branches of the heat engine . in subsection [ subs : iic ] we will discuss on examples under which conditions the heat engine is capable of producing positive work .",
    "other performance characteristics of the engine like its efficiency and output power will be introduced in section  [ sec : max_eta ] and discussed in the rest of the paper .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     although the low - dissipation assumption may not be fulfilled in actual thermal plants , it is tempting to confront the efficiency intervals ( [ eq : boundsmv])-([eq : boundsmo ] ) with real data .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_plants ] , where we compare the individual efficiency intervals with experimental data measured for various actual thermal plants ( tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] , data taken from @xcite ) . within the bounds for the efficiency at maximum @xmath17 fall five experimental points while within those at maximum power lie seven of them .",
    "the points belonging to the @xmath17 sector lie closer to its middle , while the points which fall into the maximum power sector lie closer to its borders .",
    "hence this ( very limited ) set of data suggests that at least some real thermal plants operate close to optimum @xmath17 conditions rather than close to maximum power .",
    "notably , the data which fits well into the interval corresponding to the optimal @xmath17 were all obtained from nuclear power plants , see tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] .",
    "we have utilized the known results @xcite on the emp for low - dissipation carnot cycles to derive new universality in optimization of trade - off between power and efficiency .",
    "our main results are eqs .",
    "( [ eq : reldp ] ) and ( [ eq : reldeta ] ) which demonstrate that any trade - off measure expressible in terms of efficiency @xmath18 and the ratio @xmath19 of power to its maximum value exhibits the same degree of universality as the emp . consequently , for many systems",
    "the trade - off measure can be optimized independently of most details of the dynamics and of the coupling to thermal reservoirs .    in order to demonstrate this result",
    "we have introduced two specific trade - off measures .",
    "the first one ( [ eq : tradeoff ] ) is designed for finding optimal efficiency for a given output power .",
    "the performed optimization clearly reveals diseconomy of engines working at maximum power .",
    "engines operating in regimes near the maximum power with slightly smaller power and considerable larger efficiency are more economical ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : universal2]-[fig : universal4 ] ) . within the second example",
    "we have derived universal lower and upper bounds ( [ eq : boundsmv ] ) on the efficiency at maximum trade - off given by the product of power and efficiency ( [ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "comparison of the obtained bounds ( [ eq : boundsmv ] ) with data from actual nuclear power plants gives promising results , see fig  [ fig : power_plants ] .",
    "the data points outside the interval ( [ eq : boundsmv ] ) could result from thermal plants not operating at maximum value of the product of power and efficiency ( [ eq : lambda ] ) or not operating in the low - dissipation regime at all .    all the results have been illustrated on a diffusion - based heat engine specified in secs  [ sec : model]-[sec : max_eta ] .",
    "these engines operate in the low - dissipation regime given that the used driving minimizes the work dissipated during the isothermal branches .",
    "the peculiarities of the corresponding optimization procedure have been reviewed and thoroughly discussed in secs.[sec : max_eta ] and [ sec : maxp ] .",
    "let us note that this analysis has been performed for overdamped models only and it could be interesting to consider also the underdamped case . in this respect",
    "only few studies are available in the literature so far @xcite .",
    "the low - dissipation assumption allows performing quite general analyzes . while this assumption may be reasonable for many systems @xcite , it is definitely not general",
    ". therefore it is important to investigate also cases where the work dissipated during the isothermal branches behaves differently than in the low - dissipation regime .",
    "the present study has been performed for carnot cycles with infinitely fast adiabatic branches .",
    "similar research of carnot cycles with adiabatic branches performed in finite - time @xcite and also of other thermodynamic cycles like the joule cycle or the stirling cycle could provide further insight .",
