    "in the past decades , great efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the spin relaxation in various systems , aiming to incorporate the spin degree of freedom of carriers into the traditional electronic devices.@xcite in @xmath0-type iii - v zinc - blende semiconductors , the spin relaxation is mainly governed by the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism@xcite via the joint effects of the momentum scattering and the @xmath1-dependent effective magnetic field ( inhomogeneous broadening@xcite ) induced by the dp spin - orbit coupling.@xcite the dp spin - orbit coupling is contributed by the dresselhaus@xcite term as well as the possible rashba@xcite term if the structure inversion symmetry is broken . in quantum - well structure , the effective magnetic field from the gate - voltage tunable rashba term is proportional to @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the growth direction ) , whereas that from the dresselhaus term varies with the growth direction .",
    "therefore , with special growth direction , spin - polarization direction and/or relative strength of the rashba and dresselhaus terms , spin relaxation may show intriguing properties . in ( 001 ) asymmetric gaas quantum wells , the relaxation for spins along [ 110 ] or [ 1@xmath4 can be strongly suppressed when the rashba and dresselhaus terms are comparable in magnitude.@xcite in ( 110 ) symmetric gaas quantum wells , the effective magnetic field solely contributed by the dresselhaus term is along the growth direction.@xcite therefore for spins along the growth direction the dp relaxation mechanism is absent and other relaxation mechanisms should be taken into account.@xcite    for ( 111 ) iii - v zinc - blende quantum wells , the spin relaxation may also show rich properties , due to the interplay of the rashba and dresselhaus terms . setting the @xmath3-axis along the growth direction [ 111 ] , @xmath5-axis along [ 1@xmath60 ] and @xmath7-axis along [ 11@xmath8",
    ", the dp term for the lowest subband can be expressed as @xmath9 here terms containing coefficient @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are contributed by the dresselhaus ( rashba ) spin - orbit coupling ; @xmath12 stands for the electric field from the gate voltage and @xmath13 is the average of the operator @xmath14 over the electron state of the lowest subband under the infinite - depth square well assumption .",
    "@xmath15 is referred to as the effective magnetic field , while the spin - orbit coupling term in the hamiltonian introduced by the dp mechanism is expressed as @xmath16 .",
    "based on eqs.([eq1])-([eq3 ] ) , cartoix _ et al .",
    "_ proposed that a peak of the spin relaxation time ( srt ) in the gate - voltage dependence appears at @xmath17 in ( 111 ) gaas quantum wells when the cubic term in @xmath15 is neglected.@xcite in ( 111 ) ingaas quantum wells , vurgaftman and meyer also investigated the spin relaxation , showing that the temperature affects the gate - voltage dependence of the inhomogeneous broadening strongly and hence the srt.@xcite both investigations are based on the single - particle approach .",
    "besides the gate - voltage dependence , the electron density and temperature dependences of the srt can also show special properties . for convenience , we rewrite the in - plane dp term as @xmath18{\\bf \\hat{z}}\\times{\\bf k}. \\label{inplanedp}\\ ] ] from this equation",
    ", one finds that when @xmath19 is equal to the critical value modulated by the gate voltage : @xmath20 @xmath21 becomes zero as shown by the circle in the schematic of @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ figszw1 ] .",
    "it is noted that this phenomenon only happens when @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 . under this condition",
    ", the srt of spins polarized along the @xmath3-axis tends to infinity if the spin - polarized electrons distribute exactly on the critical circle in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "however , in reality , the temperature is higher than zero and the distribution of the spin - polarized electrons spreads out around the average fermi momentum .",
    "also , the electron density can be changed and hence the average fermi momentum can be shifted away from @xmath25 .",
    "even so , with proper temperature and/or electron density , the condition @xmath26 can be satisfied and then the in - plane inhomogeneous broadening @xmath27 is suppressed .",
    "this may lead to the nonmonotonicity of the inhomogeneous broadening in the temperature or electron density dependence . in the following",
    ", we refer to this effect as the `` cancellation effect '' due to the cancellation between the dresselhaus and rashba terms .",
    "it is noted that the cancellation effect is more obvious at low temperature .",
    "it may also take place when considering spin relaxations along other directions .",
    "however , when the spin polarization is deviated from the @xmath3-axis , the cancellation effect becomes weaker as the inhomogeneous broadening from @xmath28 comes into play .",
    "the nonmonotonicity of the inhomogeneous broadening may lead to a peak of the srt in the temperature or electron density dependence .",
    "we call this peak as the `` cancellation peak '' , which to our knowledge has not been studied in the literature and is hence the main focus of this work .     in momentum space .",
    "the blue solid arrows represent the in - plane components of the effective magnetic field and the red dashed ones correspond to the out - of - plane ones .",
    "the point zero stands for the origin of the * k * space .",
    "the in - plane effective magnetic field is zero on the yellow circle , where @xmath29 [ eq.([cancellationkc ] ) ] . in this schematic @xmath30  kv / cm.,width=321 ]    however , the scenario is not as simple as that presented above , since the spin relaxation is determined by the joint effects of the inhomogeneous broadening and the scattering .",
    "the scattering together with the inhomogeneous broadening further lead to a plenty of features in the electron density or temperature dependence of the srt .",
    "in fact , as revealed in the previous works , the coulomb scattering plays an important role in the spin relaxation.@xcite the nonmonotonic dependence of the coulomb scattering rate @xmath31 on temperature @xmath32 during the crossover of electrons from the degenerate to nondegenerate limits [ e.g. , for two - dimensional electrons @xmath33 @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) when @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) with @xmath38 denoting the fermi temperature@xcite ] can lead to a peak in the temperature dependence of the srt in the strong scattering limit when the coulomb scattering dominates.@xcite this peak is called as the `` coulomb peak '' in the temperature dependence .",
    "it appears around @xmath38 , with the location influenced by the temperature dependence of the inhomogeneous broadening and thus being sample dependent .",
    "the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening with increasing temperature tends to shift the peak towards a lower temperature .",
    "the peak was predicted to be close to @xmath38 in @xmath0-type high - mobility ( 001 ) gaas quantum wells@xcite while later observed experimentally at about @xmath39 in @xmath0-type high - mobility ( 001 ) gaas / gaalas heterostructure.@xcite in @xmath40-type high - mobility ( 001 ) si / sige ( ge / sige ) quantum wells , the peak was predicted to be at about @xmath38 ( @xmath39).@xcite in intrinsic bulk gaas , this peak was predicted to be in the range of ( @xmath41 , @xmath39).@xcite nevertheless , when impurities are added , the coulomb peak can be destroyed.@xcite for the carrier density dependence of the srt , a peak also appears around the crossover of the nondegenerate and degenerate limits.@xcite this is because the inhomogeneous broadening varies little with density in the nondegenerate limit where the boltzmann distribution can be well satisfied but increases with increasing density in the degenerate limit [ this monotonic dependence widely exists in the systems where the cancellation effect is absent , such as ( 001 ) gaas quantum wells or bulk gaas ] .",
    "therefore , if the total scattering rate increases with increasing density in the nondegenerate limit , the srt increases also provided the system is in the strong scattering limit . in the degenerate limit , the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening with increasing density is faster than that of the scattering , and thus the srt decreases with the increase of density .",
    "consequently a peak ( the normal density peak ) appears.@xcite it is noted that all the scatterings can contribute to this peak .",
    "nevertheless , in the system where the coulomb scattering dominates , this density peak is referred to as the coulomb peak in the density dependence in this manuscript .",
    "similar to the coulomb peak in the temperature dependence , the location of the density peak is also sample dependent , usually with the corresponding fermi temperature @xmath42 @xmath43-@xmath32.@xcite the above phenomena may also arise here in ( 111 ) gaas quantum wells and lead to a distinguishable peak in the regime away from the cancellation peak .",
    "moreover , when this peak and the cancellation peak appear simultaneously , they may even interplay with each other .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt the fully microscopic many - body kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach@xcite to investigate the spin relaxation in ( 111 ) gaas quantum wells , with all the relevant scatterings included . the electron density and temperature dependences of the spin relaxation along the @xmath3-axis under different conditions ( e.g. , distinct gate voltages and impurity densities , etc . )",
    "are studied .",
    "two peaks can be observed in the electron density dependence of the srt when the temperature is low under proper gate voltages .",
    "one is the coulomb peak while the other is the cancellation peak .",
    "the location of the former is insensitive to the gate voltage while that of the latter is modulated by the gate voltage .",
    "under the proper gate voltage , these two peaks merge together and the srt is largely prolonged .",
    "however , when the temperature increases , only one peak , the normal density peak , is observed . in the temperature dependence of the srt",
    ", the coulomb peak can be observed if the cancellation effect is excluded under a large gate voltage .",
    "when the cancellation effect is present under a relatively smaller gate voltage , it together with the temperature dependence of the scattering lead to a single peak in the temperature dependence of the srt . the effect of impurities on the temperature dependence of the spin relaxation is investigated . under the large gate voltage",
    "the coulomb peak is destroyed by the impurities . however , under the small gate voltage where the cancellation effect is present , a peak always exists even with very high impurity density . as the cancellation of the dp term only happens in the quantum - well plane",
    ", we also investigate the anisotropic spin relaxation by varying the spin - polarization direction .",
    "it is shown that when the spin - polarization direction is tilted from the @xmath3-axis to the in - plane one , the cancellation peak gradually disappears due to the weakening of the cancellation effect .",

    "<S> we investigate the spin relaxation limited by the dyakonov - perel mechanism in @xmath0-type ( 111 ) gaas quantum wells , by means of the kinetic spin bloch equation approach . in ( 111 ) gaas quantum wells , the in - plane effective magnetic field from the dyakonov - perel term can be suppressed to zero on a special momentum circle under the proper gate voltage , by the cancellation between the dresselhaus and rashba spin - orbit coupling terms . </S>",
    "<S> when the spin - polarized electrons mainly distribute around this special circle , the in - plane inhomogeneous broadening is small and the spin relaxation can be suppressed , especially for that along the growth direction of quantum well . </S>",
    "<S> this cancellation effect may cause a peak ( the cancellation peak ) in the density or temperature dependence of the spin relaxation time . in the density ( temperature ) </S>",
    "<S> dependence , the interplay between the cancellation peak and the ordinary density ( coulomb ) peak leads to rich features of the density ( temperature ) dependence of the spin relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of impurities , with its different weights on the cancellation peak and the coulomb peak in the temperature dependence of the spin relaxation , is revealed . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the anisotropy of the spin relaxation with respect to the spin - polarization direction . </S>"
