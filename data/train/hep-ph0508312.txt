    "the pierre auger observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector in the world  @xcite . currently under construction at malarge ( argentina ) , it has begun taking data and already accumulated an exposure comparable to previous experiments such as agasa and hires  @xcite .",
    "in addition to studying the highest energy cosmic rays , auger is also capable of observing ultra - high energy cosmic neutrinos  @xcite . at present",
    ", the amanda telescope at the south pole holds the record for the most energetic neutrino interactions observed  @xcite ; these events have energies up to @xmath1  gev and are consistent with the predicted spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "auger , by contrast , is expected to detect neutrinos with energies above @xmath2  gev .",
    "the ability to study neutrino interactions at such high energies will open a unique window on possible physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed in which neutrino interactions become substantially modified at very high energies , the most interesting being models of low scale quantum gravity ( involving the exchange of kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons , production of microscopic black holes , and excitation of tev - scale string resonances ) , and models featuring non - perturbative electro - weak instanton induced interactions .",
    "moreover the neutrino flavor ratios predicted by the standard oscillation phenomenology can be modified in propagation over cosmological distances if processes such as neutrino decay occur .",
    "auger is expected to detect the ` cosmogenic ' neutrino flux from interactions of extragalactic ultra - high energy cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "thus , it will be sensitive to such effects , being capable of measuring the flux of ultra - high energy tau neutrinos in addition to the overall neutrino flux .    in this article",
    ", we explore the relevant phenomenology and quantify the sensitivity of auger to such new physics . in sec",

    "auger is a hybrid ultra - high energy cosmic ray detector , with a ground array of water cerenkov detectors sampling air shower particles , overlooked by air fluorescence detector telescopes which observe the longitudinal development of the showers  @xcite .",
    "when completed in 200506 , the southern hemisphere site will have 1600 detectors on the ground covering 3000 km@xmath3 , and 4 fluorescence telescopes having 6 detectors each .",
    "a similar facility has been proposed for a northern hemisphere site in colorado ( usa ) . in our calculations",
    "we consider only a single site and focus on the ground array .      at sufficiently high energies cosmic neutrinos can trigger atmospheric air showers similar to those due to high energy cosmic rays ( hadrons or photons ) .",
    "however , unlike ordinary cosmic ray showers which are initiated near the top of the atmosphere , those generated by neutrinos can be initiated at any depth since the interaction cross - section is much smaller , hence the probability of interaction per unit length is approximately constant . neutrino induced showers can thus be distinguished from cosmic ray showers by requiring that they be _ deeply penetrating_. this is most useful for distinguishing the two kinds of showers , because within @xmath4 of the horizon the electromagnetic component of hadron - induced showers is completely absorbed before reaching the detector .",
    "the rate of neutrino - induced showers expected to be observed in an experiment such as auger can be written as @xmath5 \\ ,",

    "the function @xmath15 $ ] is the probability of the experiment detecting a shower created at an atmospheric depth @xmath12 of energy @xmath16 , at a zenith angle @xmath10 . in order to ensure that such a shower can be distinguished from one initiated by a hadron or photon primary",
    ", we require that for the auger ground array :    * the zenith angle , @xmath17 , * the neutrino penetrates at least 2000 g / cm@xmath3 into the atmosphere before interacting , * the interaction takes place within 2000 g / cm@xmath3 of the detector .",
    "this third requirement is included due to the difficulty in reconstructing events beyond this range at auger . at @xmath19 , the total path length traversed before the shower hits the earth s surface is @xmath20 g / cm@xmath3 , hence relatively little atmosphere is present in which a neutrino primary can interact and be distinguished from an ordinary cosmic ray shower . at zenith angles larger than 85@xmath21",
    "however , the slant depth exceeds 10000 g / cm@xmath3 . in fig .  [ zenith ] , we show how these selection criteria will affect the observed angular distribution of quasi - horizontal showers in auger .",
    "if the neutrino - nucleon cross - section is enhanced well above the sm prediction at ultra - high energies , it is possible that this depth of atmosphere will significantly attenuate the cosmic neutrino flux ; to account for this , an additional factor of @xmath22 should be included  @xcite in eq .",
    ". for sm interactions , this factor is very nearly unity and can safely be neglected but it will be important for some of the exotic models we will consider .",

    "( [ qh ] ) describes both charged current ( cc ) neutrino - quark scattering and neutral current ( nc ) neutrino - quark scattering for which we adopt the cross - sections given in ref .",
    "the energy of the shower produced depends on the neutrino flavor and the type of interaction  @xcite .",
    "electron neutrinos undergoing cc interactions produce a shower with both an electromagnetic and hadronic component : @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "muon neutrinos undergoing cc interactions , as well as all neutrino flavors undergoing nc interactions , produce a hadronic shower with an energy , @xmath25 .",
    "charged current interactions of tau neutrinos are somewhat more complicated but more interesting .",
    "the tau lepton produced in the initial cc neutrino interaction has a decay length of @xmath26 50  m @xmath27 .",
    "thus , at sufficiently high energies , the second hadronic shower from the tau decay will be spatially separated and be identifiable as a `` double bang '' event  @xcite . lacking a full - blown simulation , we estimate that a separation of the two bangs by 10  km would be adequate for definitive identification by the auger ground array  this requires that the primary neutrino energy exceed @xmath28  gev and that the first interaction occurs 50 km or more above the ground ( which is easily satisfied for neutrino induced showers inclined over @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , if the energy exceeds @xmath30  gev , the tau lepton will hit the ground before decaying",
    ". a more careful analysis of shower profiles as seen by the auger fluorescence detectors may allow significant acceptance for such events over a somewhat broader energy range .",
    "the scattering of electron flavor anti - neutrinos with electrons can occur efficiently via the resonant exchange of a @xmath31 boson  @xcite at a neutrino energy of @xmath32  gev .",
    "although we include this process in our calculations , the detector acceptance for showers at this energy is expected to be rather low , thus this process is of only marginal importance .    to accurately determine the probability @xmath33 $ ] of the auger ground array observing a shower with a given energy , zenith angle and initiated at a given depth",
    ", a detailed detector simulation is required , which is beyond the scope of this study . to make a reasonable estimate we have modelled the energy dependence such that we reproduce the acceptances found through the simulations performed in ref .",
    "the probability function we arrive at is of order unity for shower energies of @xmath34 gev , decreases slowly down to energies of @xmath35  gev , and then falls rapidly at lower energies .",
    "we treat hadronic and electromagnetic showers separately as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in the case of a mixed electromagnetic - hadronic shower , we treat it as two separate showers for the purpose of estimating the probability of detection . in fig .",
    "[ cossmqh ] we plot the spectrum of quasi - horizontal , deeply penetrating , neutrino induced showers as would be seen by the auger ground array , for two choices of the ultra - high energy cosmic neutrino spectrum .",
    "a second class of neutrino events potentially observable at auger is generated by tau neutrinos which interact while skimming the earth s",
    "surface @xcite .",
    "such interactions can generate tau leptons which escape the earth and produce a slightly upgoing hadronic shower when they decay in the atmosphere .",
    "this does not happen for electron neutrinos since the electrons produced in cc interactions are invariably absorbed in the earth .",
    "for muon neutrinos , the produced muon can escape the earth , but will not decay in the atmosphere since the decay length is @xmath36 times longer than for a tau .",
    "when a tau lepton is generated in the earth , it loses energy via electromagnetic processes at a rate per unit length of  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38= 0.002 gev cm@xmath3/g and @xmath39 cm@xmath3/g . at very high energies",
    ", this will often dramatically reduce the energy before the tau is able to decay . at moderate energies",
    ", this has little effect over a single decay length . in fig .",
    "[ tauprop ] we show the effect of interactions for tau neutrino ` earth skimmers ' . for incoming zenith angles only slightly below the horizon ,",
    "the spectrum is not suppressed until above @xmath40  gev , while there is a noticeable pile - up near @xmath41  gev .",
    "tau leptons produced in cc interactions near the earth s surface can occasionally escape the earth before decaying , and thus produce a hadronic shower which is potentially observable by auger .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum of tau leptons escaping the earth s surface by monte carlo using the energy loss rate of eq .",
    "( [ tauloss ] ) . to calculate the probability of given tau",
    "neutrino induced shower being detected by auger , we have used the same probabilities as employed in the case of quasi - horizontal showers .",
    "in addition to this function , however , we require that the shower be initiated at a height such that the shower is still able to be detected ( for the details of this aspect of the calculation , see ref .",
    "this is particularly important for very high energy tau leptons which can escape the earth s atmosphere before decaying  @xcite .",
    "the andes mountains near auger s southern site are also a possible target for tau neutrinos ; however , we have not included this effect in our calculations as the overall correction is less than 10%  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ cossmtau ] we show the spectrum of earth skimmers as would be seen by auger .",
    "ultra - high energy neutrinos may be produced in a wide range of astrophysical sources . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss some of these possibilities .    interactions of ultra - high energy cosmic ray protons propagating over cosmological distances with the cosmic microwave background generates a cosmogenic flux of neutrinos  @xcite through the decay of charged pions produced in @xmath42 interactions  @xcite , which should also result in a suppression of the cosmic ray spectrum above the ` gzk cutoff ' : @xmath43 gev .",
    "the intermediate state of the reaction @xmath44 is dominated by the @xmath45 resonance , because the @xmath46 decay length is smaller than the nucleon mean free path on the relic photons .",
    "hence , there is roughly an equal number of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "gamma rays , produced via @xmath48 decay , subsequently cascade electromagnetically on the cosmic radiation fields through @xmath49 pair production followed by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the net result is a pile up of @xmath50 rays at gev energies , just below the threshold for further pair production . on the other hand",
    ", each @xmath47 decays to 3 neutrinos and a positron .",
    "the @xmath51 readily loses its energy through synchrotron radiation in the cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "the neutrinos carry away about 3/4 of the @xmath47 energy , and therefore the energy in cosmogenic neutrinos is about 3/4 of the one produced in @xmath50-rays .",
    "the normalisation of the neutrino flux depends critically on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources and on their proton injection spectra  @xcite .",
    "it also depends on the assumed spatial distribution of sources ; for example , relatively local objects , such as sources in the virgo cluster  @xcite , would dominate the high energy tail of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the cosmogenic neutrino flux is the energy at which there is a transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays as inferred from a change in the spectral slope .",
    "while fly s eye data  @xcite seem to favour a transition at @xmath52  gev , a recent analysis of the hires data  @xcite points to a lower value of @xmath53  gev .",
    "this translates into rather different proton luminosities at the sources  @xcite and consequently different predictions for the expected flux of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "a fourth source of uncertainty in the cosmogenic flux is the chemical composition  if ultra - high energy cosmic rays are heavy nuclei rather than protons the corresponding cosmogenic neutrino flux may be somewhat reduced  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we will adopt the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to being produced in the propagation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays , neutrinos are also expected to be generated in their sources , such as gamma - ray bursts or active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "although the details of the relationship between the cosmic ray spectrum and the cosmic neutrino spectrum are model dependent , some rather general arguments can be applied . in particular , waxman and bahcall  @xcite",
    "have shown that for compact , cosmological sources , which are optically thin to proton - proton and proton - photon interactions , an upper limit can be placed on the flux of neutrinos .",
    "we will follow them in adopting a neutrino spectrum arising from proton - proton collisions ( with an inelasticity of 60% ) : @xmath54 summed over all flavors . after oscillations during propagation , one finds at earth a nearly identical flux of the three neutrino flavors @xcite with equal number of neutrinos and antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "if the shape of the neutrino spectrum is not an @xmath55 power law , or if the other assumptions of the waxman - bahcall argument are modified , this bound can be exceeded  @xcite .",
    "for example , if their bound is evaluated under the assumption of a low galactic to extragalactic crossover energy ( @xmath56 gev rather than the @xmath30 gev used by waxman and bahcall ) a larger flux with a steeper spectrum ( @xmath57 ) is obtained @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sources which are optically thick such that only neutrinos can escape ( ` hidden sources ' ) , can easily exceed this bound  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , if the highest energy cosmic rays are not accelerated in distant astrophysical sources but are instead produced relatively locally in the galactic halo in the decays of supermassive dark matter particles , then significantly higher fluxes of ultra - high energy photons and neutrinos will also be generated  @xcite .",
    "this model was motivated by the agasa observation that the cosmic ray spectrum continues apparently without attenuation beyond @xmath58 but at the same time the events are isotropically distributed on the sky .",
    "such events have not yet been seen by auger , which has moreover set a restrictive upper limit on the fraction of photons in the cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "we have normalized the theoretical expectations for the neutrino flux from qcd and electroweak fragmentation in heavy particle decay as calculated in ref .",

    "deviations of the neutrino - nucleon cross - sections from the prediction of the simple parton model  @xcite can signal new physics beyond the sm , but might alternatively be just due to saturation effects which can substantially modify the parton density at small @xmath61 ( i.e. small energy fractions )  @xcite .",
    "these effects can significantly reduce the total cross - section at high energies , softening the power law behavior predicted by the simple ` unscreened ' parton model toward compliance with the froissart bound  @xcite . by contrast , new physics such as tev - scale quantum gravity  @xcite can enhance the neutrino interaction cross - sections .",

    "the event rates for quasi - horizontal and earth - skimming neutrinos have different responses to the inelastic cross - section  @xcite .",
    "the rate of quasi - horizontal showers _ rises _ proportional to the cross - section ( although if this exceeds @xmath62 cm@xmath3 , attenuation of the neutrino flux in the upper atmosphere becomes significant  @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , the rate of earth skimming tau events is always _ depleted _ by an enhanced neutrino - nucleon cross - section because of absorption in the earth .    in order to probe deviations from the ( unscreened ) parton model calculation of the cross - section ,",

    "[ ox ] the effect on the spectrum of earth skimmers , as a function of the incoming angle . for a cross section reduced by a factor of 2 ,",
    "the total event rate of earth skimmers is 1.4 yr@xmath63 , which is slightly _ larger _ than for the unscreened parton model .",
    "the reduction in cross - section due to screening will be energy dependent in general , but as shown in table  [ measuret ] , the effect is mainly manifest at intermediate energies of @xmath64  gev , corresponding to center - of - mass energies @xmath65  gev ; at these energies the ratio of quasi - horizontal to earth - skimming events is a useful diagnostic of any suppression in the cross - section .",
    "this is in fact primarily because the cosmogenic neutrino flux peaks at these energies , nevertheless since this represents a reasonable lower limit to the expected flux , this sensitivity is likely to be achieved and even surpassed .",
    "a factor of 2 reduction in the cross - section may appear extreme , even so it is clear that auger can probe the behavior of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in a kinematic region out of reach of forseeable accelerators .",
    "this will be particularly beneficial for callibrating different hadronic interaction models of air shower development , which presently differ significantly in their predictions  @xcite .    with regard to enhancements of the cross - section by new physics ,",
    "in general this will be different for cc and for nc interactions . to assess the sensitivity of auger",
    ", we consider a toy model in which only the nc cross - section is enhanced by a factor ranging between 3 and 100 , while assuming the inelasticity to be the same as in the sm . in fig .",
    "[ absorb ] we show that this results in a suppression of earth - skimming tau spectrum .",
    "by contrast the quasi - horizontal showers are enhanced , resulting in a steady increase of the ratio of quasi - horizontals to earth skimmers , as the nc cross - section is increased ( see table  [ measurenc ] ) .",
    "clearly auger would be sensitive to substantial increases of the nc cross - section .",
    "thus both an increase and a decrease of the neutrino - nucleon cross - section from the nave sm value will have distinctive observational signatures . to quantitatively assess the sensitivity of auger to such effects ,",
    "the uncertainty in the cosmic neutrino fluxes must also be taken into account  @xcite . moreover , to determine the acceptances to different types of events , a full detector simulation is clearly required to improve over the approximate estimates  @xcite adopted here .",

    "in addition to this advantage , cosmic neutrinos have traveled over very great distances before reaching earth , thus their detection also constitutes an extremely long - baseline oscillation experiment . instead of being limited to phenomena which occur over minuscule fractions of a second",

    ", they will reach earth in nearly equal quantities of each flavor after oscillations are taken into account .",
    "a larger than expected rate of quasi - horizontal , deeply penetrating showers , in comparison to the slightly upgoing shower rate , would thus indicate a suppression of the tau neutrino component in the ultra - high energy cosmic neutrino spectrum , due , for example , to neutrino decay .    in this study",

    "<S> the pierre auger observatory for cosmic rays provides a laboratory for studying fundamental interactions at energies well beyond those available at colliders . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to hadrons or photons , auger is sensitive to ultra - high energy neutrinos in the cosmic radiation and models for new physics can be explored by observing neutrino interactions at center - of - mass energies beyond the tev scale . by comparing the rate for quasi - horizontal , deeply penetrating air showers triggered by all types of neutrinos with the rate for slightly upgoing showers generated by earth - skimming tau neutrinos , any deviation of the neutrino - nucleon cross - section from the standard model expectation can be constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this can test models of low - scale quantum gravity ( including processes such as kaluza - klein graviton exchange , microscopic black hole production and string resonances ) , as well as non - perturbative electroweak instanton mediated processes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the observed ratios of neutrino flavors would severely constrain the possibility of neutrino decay .    </S>"
