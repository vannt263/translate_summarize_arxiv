    "to understand the peculiar electromagnetic properties of the perovskite - type cobalt oxides , ln@xmath0a@xmath1coo@xmath10 ( ln = rare earth element , a = alkli earth metal ) , such as the large negative mr,@xcite spin-(or cluster-)glass magnetism,@xcite spin - state transition@xcite and insulator - metal transition induced by doping or temperature,@xcite numerous works have been performed by many researchers .",
    "one important part of these works is to change ln@xmath7 or a@xmath11 , in order to get information of the electronic structure and magnetic states with different ionic radii or hole concentrations.@xcite    one striking feature for the richness of the physical properties of ln@xmath0a@xmath1coo@xmath10 , compared to other transition oxides like cmr manganites , nickelates and cuprates , is the presence of the various spin states for trivalent cobalt ions ( low - spin ls , co@xmath12 : @xmath13 ; intermediate spin is , co@xmath14 : @xmath15 ; high spin hs , co@xmath7 : @xmath16 ) and tetravalent cobalt ions ( ls , co@xmath17 : @xmath18 ; is , co@xmath19 : @xmath20 ; hs , co@xmath21 : @xmath22 ) , and the relative narrow energy gap between these spin states .",
    "this makes a thermally spin - state transition occur easily.@xcite recent experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the spin states are ls and the mixture of is / ls for tetravalent and trivalent cobalt ions , respectively.@xcite the conversion of different spin - states arises from the competition between comparable in magnitude the crystal - field with energy @xmath23 ( @xmath24-@xmath25 splitting ) and the intraatomic ( hund ) exchange with energy @xmath26 , leading to the redistribution of electrons between @xmath24 and @xmath25 levels .",
    "@xmath23 is found to be very sensitive to the variation in the co - o bond length ( @xmath27 ) , so the subtle balance between @xmath23 and @xmath26 may be easily disrupted by different kinds of effect , such as the hole - doping and the chemical / external pressure.@xcite among them , chemical pressure on coo@xmath28 octahedra is usually generated by decreasing the average ln - site ionic radius @xmath29 , which can cause the insulating nonmagnetic ls state because of the increase of the @xmath23 with the reduction of the coo@xmath28 octahedra volume , which results in the depopulation of the magnetic @xmath30 level .",
    "another pronounced feature in perovskite cobaltites is that the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state evolves as a result of increasing hole doping level in low @xmath3 , in the paramagnetic matrix with dominant antiferromagnetic ( afm ) superexchange interactions between co@xmath7 ions through a spin- or cluster - glass - state region.@xcite the competition between fm and afm interactions leads to a highly inhomogeneous ground state exhibiting the coexistence of fm regions , spin - glass regions and hole - poor ls regions.@xcite the evolution of these regions and the spin - states with hole concentration leads to the intricate magnetic and electronic behaviors .",
    "studies on la@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath10 system ( la(sr ) compounds ) reveal a rather rich magnetic and electronic phase diagram with the doping level : spin - glass for @xmath32 0.18 , cluster ferromagnetic behaviors for @xmath6 0.18 , insulator - like / metallic resistivity , metal - insulator transition at @xmath33 0.20 , and so on.@xcite ca- and ba - doped compounds la@xmath0a@xmath31coo@xmath9 ( a= ca , and ba ) have also been studied intensively.@xcite    besides the la compounds , other important perovskite cobaltites like ln@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath10 ( ln@xmath7 = pr@xmath7 , nd@xmath7 , sm@xmath7 , eu@xmath7 , gd@xmath7 etc . )",
    "also exhibit complex magnetic and electrical properties.@xcite in this paper , we investigated sr - doped gadolinium cobaltites systematically .",
    "however , most of the work on gd@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath2 ( gd(sr ) compounds ) was focused on the evolution of crystal structure with sr doping,@xcite magnetic and transport properties in relative high temperature ( @xmath34 77 k).@xcite the gd@xmath7 ion has different characters from la@xmath7 ion , for example , smaller ionic radius than la@xmath7 ion , the high magnetic moment with no ( l - s ) anisotropy ( l = 0 , s = 7/2),@xcite in contrast to the nonmagnetic la@xmath7 ( l = 0 , s = 0 ) .",
    "therefore , the contrasting behavior to la(sr ) compounds should be expected in gd(sr ) compounds .",
    "in fact , some distinct properties from la(sr ) compounds have been reported in the gd(sr ) compounds . in undoped sample gdcoo@xmath10 ,",
    "the cobalt ions are in low - spin state below 270 k,@xcite while in lacoo@xmath10 , the mixture of ls / is state is observed above about 100 k.@xcite especially , no metallic behavior is reported in gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 system below 300 k so far,@xcite in contrast to the metallic resistivity for @xmath35 0.20 in la(sr ) compounds . in this paper , samples annealed under the oxygen pressure of 165 atm at 500 @xmath4 are systematically investigated .",
    "cluster - glass behavior is found in low doping range , while a ferromagnetic transition is observed at high doping level .",
    "transport measurements indicate insulator - like behavior for the samples with @xmath5 0.30 , an insulator - metal ( i m ) transition around @xmath3 = 0.35 , and metallic behavior for the samples with higher @xmath3 .",
    "the system reenters insulator - like state for @xmath6 0.60 , resulting from the existence of large oxygen deficiency , and metallic state can be restored by annealing the samples at 900 @xmath4 and under the high oxygen pressure of 240 atm .",
    "we found that the gd(sr ) compounds possess less conductance and lower fm transition temperature relative to la(sr ) compounds@xcite and nd@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath10 ( nd(sr ) compounds),@xcite which is attributed to the large structural distortion and the stability of low - spin state arising from the smaller radius of gd@xmath7 ion .",
    "polycrystalline gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( @xmath3= 0.10 - 0.70 ) samples were prepared through conventional solid - state reaction .",
    "the stoichiometric amounts of gd@xmath36o@xmath10 , srco@xmath10 , and co@xmath10o@xmath37 powders were thoroughly mixed and fired at 1200 @xmath38c .",
    "after that , the mixture was reground and pressed into pellets which were sintered at 1200 @xmath4 for 24 h. this procedure was repeated for three times . in order to get the homogeneous sample with less oxygen deficiency , the samples",
    "were then annealed under the oxygen pressure of 165 atm at 500 @xmath4 for 48 h. x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed by rigaku d / max - a x - ray diffractometer ( xrd ) with graphite monochromated cuk@xmath39 radiation ( @xmath40 = 1.5418 @xmath41 ) at room temperature .",
    "magnetization measurement was carried out with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( mpms-7xl , quantum design ) .",
    "the resistivity measurements were performed by using the standard ac four - probe method .",
    "the magnetic field was supplied by a superconducting magnet system ( oxford instruments ) .",
    "we also determined the oxygen content of the samples using k@xmath36cr@xmath36o@xmath42 titration method .",
    "an appropriate amount of sample ( about 30 mg ) was dissolved in the mixture of vitriol and phosphate acid , then the high valent co ions were deoxidized to divalent ones with fe@xmath11 ions , and finally the excess fe@xmath11 ions were titrated with k@xmath36cr@xmath36o@xmath42 solution .",
    "figure 1 shows the xrd patterns for gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( @xmath3= 0.10 - 0.70 ) .",
    "the xrd patterns indicate that the obtained samples were all single phase and exhibited an o - type orthorhombic gdfeo@xmath10-like distorted perovskite structure ( sg : pnma , @xmath43 ) , which has been used in the gdcoo@xmath10 @xcite and gd@xmath44sr@xmath44coo@xmath10.@xcite the variation of lattice parameters with @xmath3 was plotted in fig .",
    "2 . the lattice parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 increase monotonically with the doping level , while @xmath47 firstly decreases with @xmath48 , then increases with further increasing @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that the difference among the reduced parameters becomes less with increasing @xmath3 , and nearly the same for @xmath49 , indicative of a tendency of cubic symmetry .",
    "it is reasonable since srcoo@xmath10 is cubic.@xcite the lattice volume , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , increases monotonously with @xmath3 , which is consistent with the substitution of the larger sr@xmath11 ions ( @xmath50= 1.58 @xmath51 ) for the smaller gd@xmath7 ions ( @xmath52= 1.22 @xmath41 ) .@xcite      figure 3 shows the molar magnetic susceptibility @xmath53 as a function of temperature in zero - field cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) procedures for the four typical samples . for the sample with @xmath3 = 0.60 , the @xmath53 curve behaves as a typical ferromagnet that a pronounced increase in @xmath54 occurs below a temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath55 ) , with a paramagnetic signal at low temperature , which comes from the contribution of magnetic gd@xmath7 ions .",
    "the @xmath8 corresponds to the ferromagnetic transition temperature . with decreasing sr concentration",
    ", the rise becomes to slow down and @xmath8 decreases sharply ( from about 120 k for @xmath3 = 0.45 to 80 k for @xmath3 = 0.10 ) .",
    "a rounded maximum appears below @xmath8 in the zfc @xmath53 curves .",
    "this behavior may be ascribed to the spin - glass ( sg ) magnetism , which has been reported in la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds with low doping level.@xcite in la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds , the zfc curve shows a cusp at the freezing temperature of sg.@xcite however , the zfc and fc curves in the two compounds bifurcate at a temperature much higher than that of the cusp,@xcite in contrast to the behavior observed in present gd(sr ) compounds .",
    "therefore , one may assume that gd(sr ) compounds have different magnetic property from la(sr ) and nd(sr ) system in the low doping region . in order to clarify it ,",
    "the frequency dependence of ac susceptibility was measured .",
    "figure 4(a ) and 4(b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( the in - phase and out - of - phase component of the zfc ac susceptibility ) for @xmath3 = the sample with 0.10 taken at 10 and 1000 hz .",
    "a peak can be observed in both @xmath56 and @xmath58 at 75 k. in la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds , the temperature corresponding to the peak @xmath56 is the same as that of cusp in zfc dc susceptibility.@xcite however , this temperature is much higher by 30 k than that corresponding to the maximum of the the zfc @xmath53 in gd@xmath59sr@xmath60coo@xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that the peak temperature in ac susceptibility for a spin - glass should be the same as that in zfc susceptibility , which represents a magnetic freezing temperature of sg .",
    "thus the ac susceptibility data exclude the possibility of the existence of a spin glass in gd(sr ) compounds with low doping .",
    "the absence of the spin glass for @xmath3 = 0.10 is illustrated more clearly by the nearly frequency independence of the peak temperature of @xmath56 in fig .",
    "4(c ) , which shows a `` closeup '' of this peak in @xmath56 , measured with a temperature spacing of 0.5 k. measured from 1 hz to 1000 hz , the peak temperature of @xmath56 shifts to higher side by less than 0.65@xmath61 ( = 0.5k/77k ) , while it is much larger than this value in la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds ( for instance , it changes about 2@xmath61 in la(sr ) compounds).@xcite consequently , the peak in ac susceptibility could not be an indication of a sg behavior .",
    "4(d ) and 4(e ) also displays the `` closeup '' of the ac susceptibility @xmath56 for the samples with @xmath3 = 0.30 and 0.60 . with the frequency changing from 1 hz to 1000 hz ,",
    "the peak of @xmath56 for @xmath3 = 0.30 shifts to higher temperature by less than 0.5 k , while the peak position for @xmath3 = 0.60 is independent of the frequency . from fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , it can be concluded that there is a small ferromagnetic component in the samples with @xmath3 = 0.10 and 0.30 .",
    "apparently , ferromagnetic clusters are very diluted by nonmagnetic matrix in this compound and interact very weakly with each other .",
    "therefore , the weak frequency dependence of the temperature corresponding to the peak of @xmath56 in the samples with @xmath3 = 0.10 and 0.30 suggests existence of a cluster - glass , while the frequency independence of the peak position for the sample with @xmath3 = 0.60 indicates a ferromagnetic transition .",
    "figure 5 shows the zfc 1/@xmath53 as the function of @xmath62 for the sample with @xmath3=0.45 .",
    "the @xmath53 can be well fitted with the curie - weiss law in the temperature range above @xmath8 .",
    "based on the fitting result , the effective magnetic moment per cobalt ions @xmath63 can be obtained by subtracting the gd@xmath7 contribution ( @xmath64(gd@xmath7)= 7.94@xmath65 ) from the total @xmath64= @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , the curie constant).@xcite the obtained @xmath63 is 2.96@xmath65 , which is much less than 3.67@xmath65 in la@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath10 with the same doping level,@xcite indicative of lower spin state for gd(sr ) compounds relative to la(sr ) compounds .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "5 shows the @xmath68 loop for the sample with @xmath3=0.45 at 5 k , exhibiting ferromagnetic behavior with spontaneous magnetization and clear hysteresis with a paramagnetic component .",
    "the non - saturating component comes from the corporate effect of large paramagnetic signal from gd@xmath7 ions and the cluster nature of ferromagnetic state,@xcite where some fraction of the co spins exists in the paramagnetic matrix .",
    "it should be pointed out that the coercive field for this sample at 5 k is as large as 2850 oe , which is much larger than that in la(sr ) compounds @xcite but comparable to nd(sr ) compounds.@xcite this pronounced coercive behavior is believed to reflect the magnetic inhomogeneity and the formation of ferromagnetic clusters.@xcite we note that in the inset of the fig .",
    "5 the samples with @xmath3 = 0.10 and 0.30 also show a small spontaneous magnetization , which can be comparable with that observed in low doping la(sr ) compounds.@xcite such a small spontaneous magnetization at 5 k and the weak frequency dependence of the temperature corresponding to the peak in @xmath56 for the two samples indicate a cluster - glass .",
    "actually , rey - cabezudo et al.@xcite have considered a cluster picture about the magnetism for the gd(sr ) samples with @xmath5 0.30 .",
    "figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity @xmath69 for the gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 system ( @xmath3= 0.10 @xmath70 0.70 ) .",
    "the @xmath3= 0.10 sample exhibits an insulating behavior in the whole temperature range .",
    "with increasing sr up to 0.45 , @xmath69 decreases dramatically . at 4.2 k",
    ", @xmath69 drops by more than 1000 times for the sample with @xmath3= 0.30 and by more than 10@xmath71 times for the sample with @xmath3= 0.45 relative to the sample with @xmath3=0.10 .",
    "an insulator - metal transition occurs around 110 k as the sr content increases up to 0.35 .",
    "the @xmath3= 0.45 sample shows metallic behavior down to 4.2 k and a kink around 120 k , which coincides with the ferromagnetic transition temperature .",
    "such a kink in @xmath69 is a common feature for an itinerant ferromagnet because of the reduction of scattering from spin disorder in ferromagnetic state as observed in cmr manganites @xcite and la@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath10 ( 0.30 @xmath720.60).@xcite with further increasing sr content above 0.45 , the @xmath69 increases rapidly .",
    "the @xmath69 for the sample with @xmath3= 0.50 shows still metallic behavior in whole temperature range , while an upturn in low temperature is observed in @xmath69 for the sample with @xmath3= 0.55 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the position of the kink in @xmath69 shifts to higher temperature with increasing @xmath3 from 0.40 to 0.55 , which is consistent with the enhancement of @xmath73 with increasing @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "as sr content increases to 0.60 , the resistivity shows a reentrance of the insulating state .",
    "figure 7 shows the isothermal magnetoresistance at 20 k as a function of magnetic field for gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 with @xmath3=0.10 , 0.45 , and 0.60 , respectively . a large negative",
    "mr [ ( @xmath74\\times100\\%$ ] as high as -28.5@xmath61 is achieved in the @xmath3 = 0.10 sample at 13.5 t. the x@xmath75 sample , which is the most metallic among all the samples , exhibits a smallest negative mr @xmath76 -6@xmath61 at 13.5 t. the mr in @xmath3= 0.60 sample increases to -14@xmath61 at 13.5 t. this suggests that magnetic field has the strongest effect on the most insulating samples .",
    "it suggests that the mr depends on not only the ferromagnetic state , but also the insulating state .",
    "attention should be paid to the insulator - reentering behavior for @xmath6 0.60 since the end compound srcoo@xmath10 is metallic . to consider the origin for the reentrance of the insulating state , one must note the fact that it is difficult to achieve full oxygen stoichiometry at high - doping level in ln@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath10 system .",
    "yo et al.@xcite found that there exists large oxygen deficiency in dy@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath2 and sm@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath2 , and the oxygen deficiency reaches 0.29 and 0.36 for the samples with @xmath3 = 0.75 for the two systems , respectively .",
    "ryu et al.@xcite reported that there also exists large oxygen deficiency in gd@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath2 for the samples with high doping level .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the reentrance of the insulator state , the oxygen content is determined .",
    "the k@xmath36cr@xmath36o@xmath42 titration experiments indicate that the oxygen contents are 2.912 , 2.728 , and 2.602 for as - grown samples with @xmath3 = 0.45 , 0.60 , and 0.70 , respectively , while 2.935 , 2.745 , 2.703 after annealing under the oxygen pressure of 165 atm at 500 @xmath4 for 48h .",
    "it turns out that there really exists a large oxygen deficiency at high doping level and annealing procedure under high oxygen pressure reduces the deficiency .",
    "compared to the annealing procedure at 500 @xmath4 , the samples are annealed under the high oxygen pressure of 240 atm at 900 @xmath4 , and the resistivity for these samples is shown in fig .",
    "the sample with @xmath3 = 0.60 exhibits metallic resistivity in the whole temperature range below 300 k. the sample with @xmath3 = 0.70 also becomes much less insulating , with @xmath77 k@xmath78/@xmath79 k@xmath804/3 , in contrast to that annealed at 500 @xmath4 ( larger than 100 ) .",
    "metallic state should be restored in the sample with @xmath3 = 0.70 after further annealing under higher oxygen pressure .",
    "the k@xmath36cr@xmath36o@xmath42 titration experiments indicate that the oxygen contents are 2.787 and 2.755 for @xmath3 = 0.60 and 0.70 after annealing under the oxygen pressure of 240 atm at 900 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the oxygen deficiency leads to the reentrance of the insulating behavior for the samples with @xmath3 @xmath81 0.60 .",
    "figure 9 shows the phase diagram of gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( @xmath82 ) according to the above results . in fig . 9 , one can found a pronounced feature that the gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 system has much lower ferromagnetic transition temperature compared to la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds , for instance , @xmath8 in gd@xmath44sr@xmath44coo@xmath2 annealed under the high oxygen pressure of 240 atm at 900 @xmath4 ( @xmath83 0.032 ) is around 150 k , while in la@xmath44sr@xmath44coo@xmath9 it is about 240 k. another feature in fig .",
    "9 is that the critical sr concentration for mit ( @xmath76 0.35 ) is much larger than that in la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds .",
    "taking into account the fact that the less conducting gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 samples have the lower @xmath8 , one may suppose a correlation between metallic conductivity and ferromagnetic order as it would be expected with a double - exchange model as in doped manganites .",
    "this opinion could be supported by the fact that both the conductance and @xmath8 increases as oxygen content increases , as inferred from fig.6 , fig . 8 and fig .",
    "it is well known that @xmath8 in doped manganites is argued to be mainly determined by two kinds of structural distortion.@xcite this is also believed to be plausible in cobaltites.@xcite the first is a global distortion arising from the deviation of the structure from the cubic symmetry , which is described by the deviation of tolerant factor @xmath84 (= @xmath85 for the formation of acoo@xmath10 ) . the much smaller ion radius of gd@xmath7 ion relative to la@xmath7 ( @xmath86= 1.36 @xmath51 ) or nd@xmath7 ( @xmath87= 1.30 @xmath51 ) ions@xcite leads to a much smaller tolerant factor in gd(sr ) compounds compared to those in la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds .",
    "the second is a local distortion arising from the different ion radii at a site , which is described by the variance of the a - site ionic radii @xmath88 (= @xmath89 for ln@xmath0m@xmath31coo@xmath10 , where @xmath90 = @xmath91 . ) .",
    "the radius of sr@xmath11 ion is much larger than that of gd@xmath7 ion , which results in a large local distortion ( such as , when ln@xmath44sr@xmath44coo@xmath10 , @xmath88 = 0.0123 for ln = gd , while 0.0016 for ln = la , and 0.0072 for ln = nd).@xcite consequently , the small tolerant factor in gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 samples means a large deviation from cubic symmetry , and the large @xmath88 suggests a pronounced local disorder .",
    "they lead to a reduction in the ferromagnetic exchange dramatically and thus the ferromagnetic transition temperature and conductance .",
    "in addition , gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 is a more complex system due to the large oxygen deficiency at high doping level , which would influence the structural distortion and the carrier concentration markedly .",
    "this could be another cause for the low ferromagnetic transition temperature and conductance .",
    "actually , there is a further reason for the suppression of conductance and ferromagnetism in gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 . compared to manganites",
    ", the conversion of various spin - states of co ions in cobaltites influences the magnetic and the transport properties of cobaltites seriously . the ferromagnetic exchange and charge transport are thought to occur mainly through the hopping of @xmath25 electrons , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "9 . the @xmath24 electrons hopping can also occur , but it possesses a much smaller possibility to take place .",
    "therefore , the existence of @xmath25 electrons is vital for metallic ferromagnetic order .",
    "recently , lengsdorf et al.@xcite reported a transition from the conducting state to the insulating state and a decrease of @xmath92 induced by pressure in la@xmath93sr@xmath94coo@xmath10 .",
    "this peculiar behavior has been attributed to a gradual change of the spin state for the trivalent ions from magnetic to a nonmagnetic spin state under pressure . in lacoo@xmath10 , it was found to undergo an intermediate- to low - spin state transition under pressure.@xcite the change of the spin state with pressure is realized due to the increase in the energy of the crystal - field splitting ( @xmath23 ) under pressure .",
    "the increase of @xmath23 makes the low - spin co@xmath12 more stable .",
    "gd@xmath7 ion has a much smaller radius than la@xmath7 , therefore , the replacement of gd@xmath7 for la@xmath7 ion has the similar effect like a pressure applied to some extent .",
    "it naturally leads to an increase of @xmath23 and an enhancement of the stability of the low - spin state than in the la(sr ) compounds . indeed , very recently knizek et al .",
    "observed a much larger @xmath23 of co ions in gdcoo@xmath10 than that in lacoo@xmath10.@xcite the much smaller effective magnetic moment at co ions in gd(sr ) compounds relative to la(sr ) system , suggested in fig .",
    "5 , confirms the lower spin - state in gd(sr ) system .",
    "furthermore , due to the higher acidity ( i.e. , a higher charge / radius ratio ) of gd@xmath7 , the gd@xmath7 ions compete more strongly with cobalt ions in covalent bonding to the oxygen atoms than la@xmath7 ions .",
    "this leads to narrower co - o bands and more stable @xmath95(co - o ) levels.@xcite this also causes a more stable low - spin configuration in gd(sr ) compounds .",
    "therefore , the smaller ion radius and the higher acidity of gd@xmath7 ion relative to la@xmath7 ion lead to a larger @xmath23 , which favors a low - spin co@xmath12 .",
    "the stabilized low - spin co ions results in the reduction of the population of @xmath96 electrons .",
    "this is another important cause for the less conductance and lower @xmath8 in gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 relative to la(sr ) and nd(sr ) compounds .",
    "finally , the large magnetic moment of gd@xmath7 ( s = 7/2 , @xmath97 = 7.94 @xmath65 ) should be considered . in this paper ,",
    "no obvious effect of the magnetic moment of gd@xmath7 on magnetic and transport behavior is observed except for a strong paramagnetic signal in low temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , a larger effective field than the applied field on co ions system can be achieved because the easy orientation of gd@xmath7 sublattice in a magnetic field .",
    "rey - cabezudo et al.@xcite pointed out that the paramagnetic gd@xmath7 sublattice polarizes the cobalt magnetic clusters .",
    "it has been considered as one possible reason for the low - temperature mr .",
    "however , it has been reported that large negative mr ( more than 80@xmath61 at 5 k for @xmath3=0.09 ) was observed in low temperatures for insulator - like compositions of la@xmath0sr@xmath31coo@xmath9.@xcite considering the fact of the nonmagnetic la@xmath7 ion , the interpretation proposed by rey - cabezudo et al .",
    "based on gd@xmath7 ions may be in doubt . in ref .",
    "24 , wu et al.@xcite interpreted such a negative mr at low temperature in terms of a short - range fm ordered cluster model .",
    "the co@xmath14 and co@xmath98 in the hole - rich clusters are aligned by magnetic field , so that an increase in the electrons hopping possibility results in a negative mr",
    ". therefore , the smallest mr observed in most metallic composition @xmath3 = 0.45 can be understood with the picture proposed by wu et al . in la(sr )",
    "it should be pointed out that such low - temperature smallest mr in the most conductive samples is also observed in la(sr ) system.@xcite this indicates that the large negative in low temperature in gd(sr ) compounds has the same origin as that in la(sr ) compounds .",
    "the evolution of magnetic and transport properties with @xmath3 in gd@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( 0.10 @xmath99 0.70 ) annealed under the oxygen pressure of 165 atm at 500 @xmath4 has been systematically investigated .",
    "cluster - glass behavior is observed in the low doping range , while the samples show the fm transition in high doping region .",
