    "the physical motivation for the mathematical development in this paper stems from a role of equation ( [ eq - intro ] ) in recent cosmological theories .",

    "[ figoscillon ] .",
    "oscillons have also been studied in the context of other simple models of early universe phase transitions @xcite .",
    "these coherent structures seem to capture the essential features of the oscillon phenomenon in simulations of the full standard model in three - dimensional space .",
    "localized oscillating solutions had been previously found in models of vibrating granular media @xcite . in the cosmological context , the external forcing is replaced by thermalization of initial conditions , and the dissipation is scale - independent .",
    "the  friction \" term , containing the first time - derivative of the field , results from the expansion .",
    "the structures seen in fig .  [ figoscillon]a are localized , low - frequency oscillations .",
    "the equation is written in a coordinate system in which the expansion of the universe is not apparent .",
    "rather , the oscillons , which are of constant physical width , steadily decrease in width in the chosen units .",
    "the system ( [ eq - intro ] ) is formally hamiltonian , with time - dependent hamiltonian density @xmath10 + \\e^{ht } v(u),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the canonical momentum that is conjugate to @xmath12 .",
    "that is , we can write the canonical equations : @xmath13 liouville s theorem , which applies even when the hamiltonian is explicitly time - dependent , precludes the collapse of the whole phase space to a lower - dimensional manifold , so that a standard attractor can not exist for the oscillon equation .",
    "this paper demonstrates that , by suitably adapting the notions of dissipativity and of _ basin of attraction _ , an alternative construct , the _ pullback attractor _",
    ", is able to capture the intuitive notion that oscillons define a restricted portion of the full phase space .",
    "well - posedness of , supplemented with ordinary ( e.g.  periodic or dirichlet ) boundary conditions , is classical .",
    "in fact , to this regard can be seen as a nonlinear damped wave equation in space dimension 1 with time - dependent speed of propagation @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to see that it generates a nonautonomous dynamical system ( _ process _ ) on the energy phase space @xmath15 ( see references ) .",
    "therefore , the main concern of the paper is the study of the dissipative properties and asymptotic behavior of the process . in particular , we are interested in the construction of some sort of attractor , i.e.a `` thin '' ( compact , possibly finite - dimensional ) subset of the phase space which is invariant under the process and embodies the long - term dynamics of the system .    while the theory of attractors for autonomous systems is well - established ( see @xcite for theoretical background and classical applications ) ,",
    "there is less common ground in the nonautonomous case .",
    "the _ uniform attractor _ approach , initiated by haraux @xcite , and further developed by chepyzhov and vishik @xcite , relies essentially on the compactness of the nonautonomous terms in the equation , and therefore is not applicable in our case .    on the contrary",
    ", the framework of pullback attractors , as developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for more recent investigations ) , does not pose essential restrictions ( for example , translation boundedness or translation compactness ) on the nonautonomous terms and allows for time - dependent limit objects ( absorbing families and attractors ) .",
    "roughly speaking , a pullback attractor @xmath16 is a ( time - dependent ) family of compact sets which is invariant under the solution operator and attracts all solutions originating sufficiently far in the past .",
    "the set @xmath4 describes the _ regime _ of the system at time @xmath17 ; the solutions starting sufficiently early have forgotten the initial data and , thanks to the invariance property , their future evolution is well described by @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to the uniform attractor framework , the sets @xmath4 may very well not be uniformly bounded as @xmath19 .    for our system ,",
    "the lack of dissipation for the natural energy @xmath20 due to the singularities of the speed of propagation for @xmath21 and to the structure of the equation , prevents the existence of a pullback absorbing set in the usual sense . for example , in the linear homogeneous case @xmath22 , one has the conservation law @xmath23 so that @xmath24 approaches a constant depending on the size of the data at time @xmath25 , as @xmath26 .    to circumvent these issues ,",
    "we adopt a new point of view on pullback dissipativity . _",
    "the main idea is to restrict the basin of attraction to those families of sets of the phase space whose ( time - dependent ) energy @xmath27 , dictated by the problem , is bounded as time goes to @xmath28 _ to this purpose , we describe the solution operator as a family of maps acting on a time - dependent family of spaces @xmath29 . in our problem , the spaces are all the same linear space with the norms @xmath30 , @xmath31 equivalent for any fixed @xmath32 .",
    "however , as it will be clear below , this equivalence blows up as we let @xmath33 .",
    "in the subsequent section 2 , we describe an abstract framework for dynamical processes on time - dependent spaces and provide the main existence result for time - dependent global attractors .    in section 3 , we formulate the evolution problem generated by eq . and provide the main dissipative estimate of the paper .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the construction of the time - dependent attractor for the process corresponding to eq . .",
    "in section 5 we briefly describe the structure of the attractor and some forward convergence results in the case of the potentials coming from the physics literature .",
    "in particular , possible nontriviality of the pullback attractor for very flat potentials , discussed in subsection 5.1 , points to a way in which the oscillon behavior of figure [ figoscillon ] might be explained in future extensions of the present work .",
    "finally , section 6 is dedicated to establishing finite dimensional reduction on the time - dependent attractor .",
    "as roughly described in the introduction , we need to modify the classical framework of pullback attractors in order to handle evolution problems , like , where the nonautonomous terms appear at a _ functional _ level , even acting on the space derivatives of the highest order , and not merely as an external time - dependent forcing .",
    "therefore , the two parameter solution operator will be described by a family of maps acting on a one parameter family of spaces @xmath29 , which we continue to call process .      for @xmath34 ,",
    "let @xmath29 be a family of banach spaces .",
    "a ( continuous ) _ process _ is a two - parameter family of mappings @xmath35 with properties    * @xmath36 ; * @xmath37 ; * @xmath38 for @xmath39    in the concrete case examined in",
    " 3-5 , the spaces @xmath29 are all the same linear space with the norms @xmath30 , @xmath31 equivalent for any fixed @xmath32 , whereas the equivalence blows up as we let @xmath40 .",
    "however , this is not needed for most of the theory we develop hereafter , and the present framework can handle evolution problems in which the spaces @xmath41 are completely unrelated .",

    "it seems physically reasonable to assume that the collection of `` bounded sets '' , which usually constitutes the basin of absorption , or attraction of a global attractor , contains only those families with bounded energy , as dictated by the problem .",
    "a family of compact subsets @xmath53 is called [ def : attractor]_time - dependent global attractor _ if it fulfills the following properties :    * ( invariance ) @xmath54 , for every @xmath55 ; * ( pullback attraction ) for every pullback - bounded family @xmath50 and every @xmath34 , and @xmath56 , the hausdorff semidistance is defined as @xmath57 from the definition , @xmath58 if and only if @xmath59 is contained in the closure of @xmath60 . ] @xmath61    if property ( ii ) holds uniformly wrt @xmath34 , @xmath18 is a _ uniform _ time - dependent global attractor .",

    "indeed , assume that @xmath18 and @xmath62 are two pullback - bounded time - dependent global attractors for the process @xmath63 .",

    "an equivalent characterization is the following : @xmath74    in the remainder of the paper , we will generally omit the phrase _ time - dependent _ and hence say _ global attractor _ for _ time - dependent global attractor_.      this subsection is devoted to a result of existence of a ( time - dependent ) global attractor .",
    "we will make use of the kuratowski measure of noncompactness : if @xmath43 is a banach space and @xmath75 , @xmath76 hereafter we recall some properties of the kuratowski measure we are going to use , redirecting to @xcite for more details and proofs :    * @xmath77 if and only if @xmath59 is compact in @xmath43 ; * @xmath78 implies @xmath79 ; * @xmath80 ; * if @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a family of nonempty closed subsets of @xmath43 such that @xmath83 then @xmath84 is nonempty and compact ; * let @xmath82 be as in ( k.4 ) and let any two sequences @xmath85 , @xmath86 be given ; then @xmath87 possesses a subsequence converging to some @xmath88 .",
