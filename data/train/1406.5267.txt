    "measurement and measurement reversal has been proposed theoretically @xcite , and it has been experimentally implemented in the last few years @xcite . the researches focus on the fidelity and quantum entanglement of a quantum system protected by weak measurement and measurement reversal under decoherence @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that quantum entanglement is only one of the ingredients of quantum features @xcite . as a larger family ,",
    "quantum correlations are believed to reflect more about the quantumness in qip @xcite .",
    "explicitly , quantum entanglement is a subset of quantum correlations for mixed states . in most qip tasks",
    ", we always face the situation that the quantum system is a mixed state , especially when the quantum system suffers from decoherence .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to study , and to protect , the quantum correlations in the realistic quantum systems under decoherence .",

    "the extension to @xmath1-configuration can be naturally done by our approach . in this case , only the transitions from @xmath2 and @xmath3 to @xmath4 are allowed , which simplifies our analysis . in order to characterize decoherence in a finite temperature environment , we use the generalized amplitude damping channel .",

    "the transitions characterized by red lines only happen when the temperature is non - zero.,width=264 ]    in this paper , we study the enhancement of quantum correlations by weak measurement and measurement reversal .",
    "we show that under decoherence , the quantum correlations between two particles can be enhanced .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ basic ] , we give the preliminaries needed in the following parts .",
    "we will introduce the local quantum uncertainty and its closed form .",
    "the kraus operators of the generalized amplitude damping for two- and three - dimensional quantum states having @xmath0-configuration energy levels are given .",
    "we have also shown the mathematical expressions for the weak measurement and measurement reversal operators . in sec .",

    "[ con ] , we have discussed the fidelity of the final output state , and give some conclusions .",
    "the local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) is defined as @xmath5 where we have denoted the two particles as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the minimum is optimized over all the non - degenerate operators on a : @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ^ 2\\}\\ ] ] is the skew information @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the closed form of the lqu for quantum states in @xmath10 is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the maximum eigenvalue of the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 with elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 represents the pauli matrices .",
    "the closed form of the lqu for a large class of high - dimentional quantum states in @xmath18 is @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath14 is a @xmath20 matrix with elements @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 are the generators of su(@xmath25 ) , namely , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it needs to be noted that the definition of the lqu requires @xmath28 not being degenerate , therefore the results after the simulation should be re - checked to make sure @xmath28 is non - degenerate when the lqu is maximized .",
    "this can be realized by the approach given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following ,",
    "unless noted , the results are checked to be valid .      for zero temperature environment , there only exists the transitions from higher energy levels to lower ones , in other words , the _ loss _ of excitations .",
    "this kind of the transition is characterized by the amplitude damping ( ad ) . in two dimensional case",
    ", the ad can be mathematically expressed by kraus operators as @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the transition probability from quantum state @xmath3 to state @xmath4 .",
    "when the temperature of the environment is non - zero , the situation turns out to be more complicated since except for the the _ loss _ of excitations , there exists the _",

    "this process can be characterized by the generalized amplitude damping ( gad ) .",
    "suppose the probability of losing the excitation @xmath3 is @xmath31 , then the probability of gaining the excitation is @xmath32 .",

( [ gad ] ) ) and assume the two particles suffer from the same quantum noises ( see fig .",

    "it can be calculated that without the weak measurement and measurement reversal , the lqu reduces to 0.134 .    as the last step , we need to perform the measurement reversal @xmath60 then the state is @xmath61 because of the large number of the parameters",

    "however , the fidelity for the non - symmetrical qubit - qubit mixed state has been improved from 0.960 to 0.964 with weak measurement and measurement reversal . to summarize , in most of the cases , due to the different physical meanings of the quantum correlations and fidelity",
