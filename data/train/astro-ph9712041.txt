    "the study of extended radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies is important to understand the evolution of radio sources . in particular , the low - brightness lobes are at a late stage of evolution and are typically confined by the intergalactic medium , therefore synchrotron losses dominate in these regions .",
    "studies of extended radio sources often suffer from limitations of the high - resolution interferometric observations , which can properly map the low - brightness regions only at low frequencies ( 610  327  mhz or lower ) . on the other hand , information on the relativistic particle ageing and on the polarization behaviour of the extended low - brightness regions",
    "is only obtained with multiple frequencies .",
    "the effelsberg 100-m radio telescope is at present the best available instrument to map the outermost regions of extended radio galaxies with good angular resolution , overcoming the problem of the lack of short spacings ( see e.g. andernach et al .",
    "1992 and mack et al .",
    "thanks to its high sensitivity , it is possible to map the extended structures at 10.6  ghz . at this high frequency ,",
    "faraday effects are generally negligible , thus the intrinsic degree of polarization and the orientation of magnetic field can be derived .",
    "moreover , energy losses in relativistic electrons are severely affecting the emission spectrum , allowing a determination of the particle ageing at different distances from the core .    in this paper",
    "we present new multi - frequency radio data of the extended tailed radio galaxies ic310 , ngc1265 , 3c129 , and 3c465 , revealing the spectral index trends and the polarization behaviour up to the outermost regions . the spectral steepening",
    "can thence be used to determine the particle ages , following e.g. the procedure of carilli et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . tailed radio sources are particularly suited for this purpose .",
    "in fact , according to currently accepted models , the morphology of these sources is affected by the drag action exerted by the intergalactic medium on the moving galaxy , and the low - brightness tails consist of aged relativistic electrons , which have reached pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas and are loosing energy essentially through synchrotron radiation and the inverse compton effect . since the radio emitting electrons",
    "are expected to be older at greater distance from the nucleus , the variation of the physical conditions with distance is related to the time evolution of the radio plasma .",

    "the polarization percentage at both 10.6 and 4.8  ghz is asymmetric and is higher in the n - s lobe ( fig .",
    "the spectral behaviour in all the sources presented here is similar .",
    "the spectrum between two given frequencies shows a progressive steepening with increasing distance from the core . moreover , the steepening is stronger in the high - frequency range than at lower frequencies . since the radio emitting electrons",
    "are expected to be older at larger distance from the core , the variation of the spectrum with distance is related to its evolution with time under the effect of radiation losses .",

    "the kp model gives a slightly better fit for the points within 7@xmath17 from the core but it is unable to fit the very steep spectrum of the more external points where the jp model fit is significantly better .    * 3c465 * - in the innermost source region , the spectral index @xmath46 is 0.6 , therefore the electron energy index @xmath41 is likely to be @xmath47 2.2 .",
    "we fitted the spectra using @xmath41 = 2.0 and 2.2 , and found that the last value gives a better fit ( see table  5 ) . in the innermost points ,",
    "both the kp and jp models provide a good fit to the spectral data , while at larger distances from the core , the kp model is increasingly better . in the outermost points of the n - s tail ,",
    "no satisfactory fit to the spectra was found , unless using a different electron energy index .",
    "this implies that a simple model of synchrotron emission can not account for the spectral flattening at high frequency .",
    "synchrotron radiation losses lead to a steepening of the emission spectrum at high frequencies with time . from the value of the critical frequency @xmath28 and of the magnetic field , it is possible to get information on the lifetime of radiating electrons suffering synchrotron and inverse compton losses against the 3k - background radiation . as the magnetic field strength , we use the equipartition value estimated at different locations along each source .",
    "the calculation of the equipartition magnetic field involves a number of assumptions ( pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "we assume the same volume for relativistic particles and magnetic field ( filling factor @xmath48 = 1 ) , the same energy in electrons and protons ( k = 1 ) , and upper and lower cutoff frequencies of 10  mhz and 100  ghz , respectively .",
    "the derived values of h@xmath29 for each source are given in the corresponding table .",
    "the previous equation is valid for the jp model , where a continuous isotropization of the pitch angle is allowed with time . in the kp model , where particles will maintain their initial pitch - angle over time ,",
    "the expression for the critical frequency differs from that valid in the jp model by @xmath36sin@xmath51 , i.e. 4/9 for an isotropic pitch - angle distribution .",
    "therefore , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) must be divided by 4/9 when using break frequencies obtained in the kp model .",
    "to use eq .",
    "( 1 ) also for the kp model , the kp break frequencies in tables  2 to 5 have been divided by 4/9 .",
    "the derived ages at different distances from the core for each source are given in tables  2 to 5 for the two models and are plotted in fig .",
    "typical errors in lifetimes are of the order of 5% . from the age , we obtained the projected drift velocity of emitting particles at different distances from the core .",
    "these are also reported in tables  2 to 5 .",
    "* ic310 * seems to be old , since the electron lifetimes in the outer regions appear to be 22.5  @xmath52  yrs .",
    "this is a bit surprising as the source is smaller than the others studied here .",
    "this could suggest the existence of strong projection effects , but this is in contrast with the low velocity ( 180 km s@xmath15 ) of ic310 with respect to the perseus cluster .",
    "we note that the radio structure shows no evidence of any transverse expansion .",
    "this suggests that the source is well confined by the external medium and that electrons have not suffered significant expansion losses , and can thus survive for such a long time .",
    "the projected velocity of radiating electrons decreases along the tail from @xmath24900  km / s to @xmath24200  km / s .",
    "projection effects would increase these values .",
    "miley ( 1973 ) pointed out that the radio plasma of ic310 , being @xmath2410 times less luminous than ngc1265 , may have been ejected with less kinetic energy .",
    "this may comply with the relatively low drift velocity inferred for its tail .",
    "* ngc1265 * reaches an age of 6.7  @xmath53  yr .",
    "the average electron velocity is @xmath243000  km / s , and increases with distance , up to 7@xmath17 from the core .",
    "the radial velocity of this galaxy with respect to the perseus cluster is 2055 km s@xmath15 .",
    "we note that odea & owen ( 1987 ) argued , based on the magnetic field in the jets , that ngc1265 should be within 45@xmath5 of the plane of the sky .",
    "if this is the case the total galaxy velocity would be consistent with the average value estimated from spectral aging .    * 3c129 * is @xmath54 yrs old in the more external regions .",
    "we remember that for the outer regions of this source only the jp model is able to fit the spectral index data .",
    "the particle velocity is around 2000  km / s , showing variations along the tail .",
    "it seems that there is an increase of velocity at about 6@xmath177@xmath17 from the core , where a large bend in the radio structure occurs .    in * 3c465",
    "* the particle lifetimes in the e - w lobe reach 66.5  @xmath53  yrs and the average velocity of emitting electrons is @xmath243500  km / s",
    ". the velocity decreases at 4@xmath17 6@xmath17 from the core , then it increases in the outermost source regions . in the n - s tail ,",
    "the points where the break frequencies have been estimated are too few to derive the trend of electron age and velocity .",
    "the velocity implied at 4@xmath17 from the nucleus is about 6500 km s@xmath15 .",
    "the ages obtained for the present galaxies are of the same order as in other objects for which similar studies were made , such as 3c31 , 3c449 ( andernach et al .",
    "1992 ) , and ngc4869 ( feretti et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the relativistic electron velocities are higher than expected , as we would expect that the particles diffuse at the typical sound speed ( some hundred km  s@xmath15 ) or that their motion reflects the proper motion of the parent galaxy within the cluster , as in ngc1265 .",
    "we note that there could be a selection effect , in that tailed radio sources with very long tails may be those associated with cluster galaxies with high proper motion .",
    "however , in all cases we detect significant local variations , with values up to 50006000 km s@xmath15 , at large distance from the core .",
    "the inferred trends could be explained by : a ) projection effects , b ) the existence of reacceleration processes , which allow the electrons to extend their lifetimes , c ) the presence of bulk streaming motions in the radio - emitting plasma . the existence of bulk streaming motions in radio galaxies has been suggested by liu et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , on the basis of similar electron ageing arguments .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that the magnetic field , which enters in the computation of the age , is not the equipartition value .",
    "we have noted , however , that the equipartition magnetic fields in these sources are always close to the values which give the maximum lifetimes ( van der laan & perola 1969 ) , therefore the use of significantly different values of the magnetic field would make the velocities still higher .",
    "we have determined the linear polarization in all sources at 10.6  ghz , and at 4.8  ghz , and 2.7  ghz ( when available ) .",
    "the degree of polarization generally increases along the tail , reaching values larger than 50% at 10.6  ghz . towards the head ,",
    "the degrees of polarization is lower , owing to beam depolarization within the regions where the twin jets ( and hence the magnetic fields tied to them ) get strongly bent backwards .",
    "for the same reason , the measured fractional polarization can also be significantly lower at the longer wavelengths .",
    "synchrotron radiation theory predicts that the intrinsic polarization percentage is given by @xmath55 where @xmath26 is the observed emission spectral index . at the tail s",
    "end the spectral index typically increases to @xmath26@xmath242 ; then the intrinsic fractional polarization expected there is @xmath2480  % . the observed polarization percentage is related to the intrinsic theoretical one by the expression @xmath56 where h@xmath57 and h@xmath58 are the ordered and random component of the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the high linear polarization percentage seen at 10.6  ghz implies a high , though not complete , degree of ordering of the magnetic field .",
    "the increase of the polarization percentage with distance from the core is much stronger than that expected from the spectral index variation ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "therefore , the degree of ordering of the magnetic field is higher as the radio emitting plasma is getting older . in 3c129 , the degree of polarization at the tail s end is close to the theoretical value .",
    "we derive that 91% of the magnetic field in this region is ordered on a scale of @xmath2420  kpc . at @xmath245@xmath17 from the core ,",
    "the ordered component of the magnetic field is @xmath2465% . in the other sources , the uniform component of the magnetic field is @xmath247075% at the tails ends on a 2030  kpc scale .",
    "if the increase in the ordering of the magnetic field is due to reconnection of the magnetic field ( e.g. soker & sarazin 1990 ) , then this would be accompanied by energy release which could also be responsible for reaccelerating the electrons .    in all sources , the magnetic field",
    "is aligned with the tails .",
    "this alignment has been interpreted as due to the anisotropic effect of ram pressure ( pacholczyk & scott 1976 ) and is consistent with the increase of magnetic field ordering along the tails .",
    "we have presented a multi - frequency study of 4 tailed radio galaxies .",
    "the results are summarized in the following .",
    "point - to - point spectra using 3 or 4 frequencies , in the range from 327  mhz to 10.6  ghz , have been obtained along the tails , up to the outermost regions .",
    "we find that the spectrum in each radio galaxy progressively steepens with distance from the core , and at each location it is steeper at higher frequencies . except for the n - s tail of 3c465 , the spectra",
    "are well fitted by models involving synchrotron energy losses , assuming both that the electron pitch angle is constant over time ( kp model ) , and that there is continuous isotropization of the pitch - angle distribution ( jp model ) .",
    "the spectral fits do not allow us to argue in favour of either the kp or jp model .",
    "the critical frequency obtained by spectral fits decreases with increasing distance from the core . assuming that the magnetic field is at the equipartition value , we show that the lifetimes of radiating electrons after synchrotron and inverse compton losses are generally between 10@xmath33 and 10@xmath59  yr , with the exception of ic310 where the electrons in the outer tail are older than 10@xmath59  yr .",
    "electron drift velocities are generally larger than 2000  km / s , and show significant variations along the tails .",
    "this implies that reacceleration processes or bulk motions should be present .",
    "the polarization data at 10.6  ghz indicate that in all the sources the magnetic fields are oriented along the tails .",
    "the polarization percentage increases along the tails , reaching values of @xmath6050% . in 3c129",
    "the polarization percentage in the outermost regions is @xmath2475% , close to the theoretical synchrotron value .",
    "the degree of ordering of the magnetic field increases along the tails , viz .",
    "up to @xmath2475% in ic310 , ngc1265 , and",
    "3c465 . in 3c129 the ordered component of the magnetic field exceeds 90% at the tail s end .",
