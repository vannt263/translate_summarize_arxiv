    "<S> transverse relaxation at the characteristic times @xmath78s affects , in principle , the coherences of both the system and the ancilla state . nevertheless , the characteristic dephasing time on @xmath67h is longer than the acquisition time . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for the @xmath32c spin is somewhat more complicated due to the much shorter value of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the diagonal nature of the initial equilibrium state of @xmath32c , together with the fact that the system - ancilla coupling commutes with the map responsible for the dephasing of its nuclear spin state , leads us to claim that , as far as we only perform measurements on the ancilla , the acquired data is unaffected by the system s transverse relaxation . </S>",

    "<S> the peaks placed in the @xmath82 semi - axis are instead proportional to the ground - state population , which decreases with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the conditional probabilities are independent of temperature , as it should be . </S>",

    "<S> we start computing the ratio @xmath93 and use it to verify the tasaki - crooks relation @xmath94 where @xmath89 is the net change in free energy of the system resulting from the process , and which can be determined as  @xcite @xmath95 . </S>",

    "<S> first , we use the formulation of the jarzynski equality  @xcite @xmath99 where , to fix the ideas , the average is taken over @xmath100 and is determined through the relation @xmath101 , obtained by analytical continuation of the characteristic function , and making use the experimental data on the transverse magnetization of the ancillary @xmath31h nuclear spin . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use the linear fit of the tasaki - crooks relation , thus combining forward and backward processes . finally , we have used the equivalent jarzynski relation  @xcite @xmath102 , calculating theoretically the ratio between the partition functions before and after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> table  i shows the mutual agreement among these approaches : quite clearly they provide mutually consistent results within the respective associated uncertainties ( the uncertainties in the theoretical results used in our third approach arise from the uncertainty in temperature of the thermal state ) , thus providing a statistically significant verification of the jarzynski equality . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the left and right - hand side of the equivalent equalities used for the assessment of the jarzynski relation have been determined experimentally in completely independent ways .        </S>",

    "<S> has allowed us to address , for the first time to our knowledge , fluctuation relations at the full quantum level and thus go significantly beyond the current experimental state - of - the - art , which was so far constrained to the classical domain . </S>",
