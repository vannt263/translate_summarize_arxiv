    "<S> in this paper , i point out that there is a curvature singularity problem appearing on non - linear level that generally plagues @xmath0 models that modify einstein gravity in the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> it is caused by the fact that for the effective scalar degree of freedom , the curvature singularity is at a finite field value and energy level , and can be easily accessed by the field dynamics in the presence of matter . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is invisible in linearized analysis , except for the tell - tale growing oscillatory modes it causes . in view of this </S>",
    "<S> , viability of many @xmath0 models in current literature will have to be re - evaluated .    </S>",
    "<S> what is causing the observed accelerated expansion of the universe today is one of the biggest open question in modern cosmology . trying to explain it by modifying theory of gravity rather than by introducing a mysterious dark energy component </S>",
    "<S> has been a popular pursuit as of late . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , it is proving to be a rather difficult thing to do consistently , while avoiding variety of stringent observational tests of gravity we have at our disposal . </S>",
    "<S> a class of such models that received much attention recently is the one which modifies einstein - hilbert gravitational action by replacing ricci curvature scalar by an arbitrary function of the curvature @xmath1 introduced in cosmological context for the case which modifies gravity in the high energy limit in a seminal paper by starobinsky  @xcite and studied in @xcite , this model has later been adopted for infrared modifications of gravity as well @xcite . for the latter application , it turned out to be not without problems . </S>",
    "<S> certain constraints have to be imposed on function @xmath0 for the model to be linearly stable @xcite and cosmologically viable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first attempts failed these constraints right away , but since then , models that evade them have been found ( for example see @xcite and references therein ) and enough trust has been placed in their viability to study cosmological structure formation in detail @xcite .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> i point out a serious curvature singularity problem that affects many , if not all , infrared - modified @xmath0 models . </S>",
    "<S> being non - linear in nature , it escaped scrutiny so far .    </S>",
    "<S> as it is well known , a new scalar degree of freedom appears in @xmath0 gravity that is not there in einstein theory ( sometimes dubbed the _ scalaron _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> conformal transformation of the metric can be employed to make it explicit in the action @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , i will avoid doing that to keep the usual matter coupling to the metric , and work with the action ( [ eq : action ] ) directly . </S>",
    "<S> variation with respect to metric yields gravitational equations of motion @xmath2 where prime ( @xmath3 ) denotes the derivative of the function @xmath4 with respect to its argument @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the usual notation for covariant dalembert operator @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for a new scalar degree of freedom is given by the trace of equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) @xmath8 identifying the scalar degree of freedom explicitly by a variable redefinition @xmath9 the equation ( [ eq : trace ] ) above is cast in the form of equation of motion of a canonical dimensionless scalar field @xmath10 with a potential @xmath11 and a force term @xmath12 @xmath13 the effective scalar field potential @xmath14 is determined by @xmath15 expressed in terms of the scalar variable @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> in practice , given @xmath0 , it is usually difficult to invert the definition of the scalar degree of freedom ( [ eq : phi ] ) explicitly , so it might be more convenient to determine effective potential @xmath11 in a parametric form instead . by integrating @xmath16 potential @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> is then given by a pair of functions @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the force term @xmath12 that drives the scalar field @xmath10 is a trace of the stress - energy tensor @xmath18 , which for perfect fluid is simply @xmath19    let us consider a homogeneous cosmological model in @xmath0 gravity , with the usual complement of matter fields . </S>",
    "<S> expansion of the universe is described by a flat friedman - robertson - walker metric @xmath20 and the scalar gravitational degree of freedom @xmath10 obeys a usual scalar field equation , albeit with a force term on the right hand side @xmath21 the analog of friedman equation in @xmath0 cosmology is not so transparent . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider @xmath22 component of gravitational equations of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) . for metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) , it is @xmath23 note that unlike the usual friedman equation , higher derivatives of scale factor @xmath24 appear . </S>",
    "<S> second derivative @xmath25 is written out explicitly , and a third derivative is hiding in a time derivative of @xmath26 term , which itself contains ricci curvature , and hence @xmath25 . seeing a second derivative of the scale factor , one might be tempted to treat the above equation ( [ eq : tt ] ) as a dynamical evolution equation for the scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> doing so , however , is not a very good idea . for small deviations from einstein gravity </S>",
    "<S> , the coefficient in front of @xmath25 goes degenerate , and the equation ( [ eq : tt ] ) does not have a good limit determining @xmath25 ( which is not all that surprising , considering that friedman equation in einstein gravity does not constrain @xmath25 directly ) . to get a proper limit , let us instead get rid of @xmath25 in favour of the curvature scalar @xmath27 after that is done , the equation ( [ eq : tt ] ) becomes @xmath28 and its role as a constraint equation is revealed . in the limit of einstein gravity @xmath29 , and so the last two terms on the left hand side disappear , and one is left with the usual friedman equation . in the general case , </S>",
    "<S> the extra terms are functions of scalar degree of freedom @xmath10 and its first time derivative . </S>",
    "<S> no higher derivatives appear in this equation anymore .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the following simple picture of dynamics in the @xmath0 cosmology emerges . above the infrared modification scale @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , the expansion rate of the universe is set primarily by the matter density , just like in the usual cosmology , with small corrections . only once the local curvature drops below @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> the expansion rate starts feeling the effect of gravity modification . </S>",
    "<S> the spacetime curvature , on the other hand , is controlled by the scalar degree of freedom @xmath10 which gravity acquires . </S>",
    "<S> it obeys the usual scalar field equation ( [ eq : box ] ) with potential @xmath14 , the shape of which is directly determined by function @xmath0 , and a driving term from the trace of matter stress - energy tensor .    but </S>",
    "<S> here is the problem : it turns out that precisely those functions @xmath0 that lead to einstein - like gravity action in the large curvature regime , yield a potential @xmath11 with an unprotected curvature singularity .    as a case in point , consider starobinsky s disappearing cosmological constant model @xcite , which has been very carefully constructed , and avoids all known linear instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> it is described by @xmath31,\\ ] ] where i have taken a liberty to absorb the cross - over curvature scale @xmath30 into rescaling of coordinates ( which become dimensionless and are measured in length units corresponding to @xmath30 ) . for definiteness , </S>",
    "<S> let us take @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar degree of freedom in this model is given by @xmath33 in terms of curvature , so large curvature limit @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> flat spacetime with @xmath36 also corresponds to @xmath37 , which gives us a hint that the potential is going to be a multi - valued function . </S>",
    "<S> the potential can be evaluated by integrating ( [ eq : pot ] ) ; up to an arbitrary constant it is @xmath38 the effective scalar potential is plotted in figure  [ fig : pot ] for @xmath39 , and is indeed multivalued . </S>",
    "<S> let us walk through the interesting locations on this plot . </S>",
    "<S> point @xmath40 is a positive curvature singularity @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> point @xmath42 is the stable de sitter minimum in this model , and point @xmath43 is the unstable de sitter maximum ; their curvatures depend on @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> point @xmath45 corresponds to a flat spacetime , which although a solution in this model , is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> points @xmath46 and @xmath47 are critical points with @xmath48 that occur at @xmath49 ; potential branches there . finally , point @xmath50 is a negative curvature singularity @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> only the small part of this potential is actually relevant for cosmological evolution from initial singularity to today , and it lies in the arc @xmath52 , shaded blue in the figure  [ fig : pot ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the most striking feature of the potential in figure  [ fig : pot ] , and the core of the problem for infrared - modified @xmath0 models , is that curvature singularity at point @xmath40 is finite distance away both in field and energy values from the place we are supposed to live in . </S>",
    "<S> scalar degree of freedom @xmath10 directly feels the matter distribution through the force term ; for equation of state @xmath53 the force is directed to the right , and drives the field @xmath10 up the wall toward point @xmath40 and infinite curvature . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic scale of the potential @xmath11 is the cross - over curvature scale @xmath30 , and hence of the same order of magnitude as a present day cosmological constant , which is exceedingly low compared to matter densities we encounter every day . given the scales involved , it appears to be quite easy to over - drive the scalar degree of freedom and make it `` jump out '' of the potential well by doing simple manipulations with normal matter ( say a pile of dust ) , which would cause catastrophic curvature singularity . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , if this were to happen , it would not make for a desirable ( or even viable ) model . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , but less dramatically , matter with sufficiently stiff equation of state can destabilize the model by driving the field to the left past the unstable point @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the curvature singularity a finite distance away is extremely disturbing by itself , but let us examine more carefully if it is reached by physically reasonable solutions . inside a constant density matter distribution , one can think of a ( constant ) force term @xmath12 as coming from a linear field potential @xmath54 instead , and introduce a new `` in matter '' effective potential @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the asymptotic de sitter vacuum field . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the two potentials @xmath11 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 is shown in the figure  [ fig : shift ] . </S>",
    "<S> as you can see , addition of matter slopes the potential @xmath57 , shifts the ( stable ) minimum to the right but makes it more shallow , and lowers the curvature singularity point @xmath59 . the density needed to make the curvature singularity energetically accessible from vacuum @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> is given by the ratio of potential barrier @xmath60 to the scalar field value distance from vacuum to singularity @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> it is of the same order as the density of dark energy today , with a numerical factor which depends on the model . </S>",
    "<S> so for vast majority of physical solutions with matter , the curvature singularity is energetically accessible from asymptotic de sitter vacuum , and the potential minimum is so close to curvature singularity that it would be invisible if actually plotted to scale .    </S>",
    "<S> energetical accessibility of the curvature singularity causes problems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if one takes a cosmological solution approaching dark energy domination today , and traces it back into the past , one is very likely to encounter a curvature singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this has been noticed numerically @xcite , but the underlying reasons for it and the extent of the damage were not fully realized . </S>",
    "<S> it is also most likely the cause of growing oscillatory curvature modes @xcite which signal the break - down of linear expansion due to closeness of potential minimum to curvature singularity . </S>",
    "<S> although a more detailed analysis of the approach to singularity is in order , from equation ( [ eq : h ] ) it appears that the singularity occurs at finite redshift , density and expansion rate , and is driven by the divergence of the second derivative of the scale factor @xmath25 ( which would make it rather weak , but a singularity nonetheless ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although i focused on cosmology so far , perhaps a more deadly argument against having a curvature singularity at finite distance in the field space comes from considering a gravitational field of a static dense compact object ( like a neutron star ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the exact non - linear solution of this problem is more complicated to analyze @xcite and is beyond the scope of this article , i can give a very simple estimate if the problem occurs . </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , the energetics of the scalar gravitational degree of freedom are by far dominated by the matter driving term . </S>",
    "<S> if we discard the contribution of non - linear potential @xmath11 ( which is negligible everywhere except maybe very close to singularity at @xmath37 for compact object ) , the equation for gravitational field of a static matter distributions becomes a simple laplace equation @xmath62 comparing this with an equation for newtonian gravitational potential @xmath63 we get a simple estimate for the excitation of scalar gravitational degree of freedom in @xmath0 gravity in terms of newtonian potential well depth @xmath64 of the compact object @xmath65 where @xmath56 is the asymptotic value of @xmath10 at infinity , i.e.  the minimum value @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> but unlike newtonian potential @xmath64 , which has to diverge to cause singularity , or reach @xmath67 to form a horizon , gravitational degree of freedom @xmath10 needs only to change by a ( small ) amount @xmath68 from its vacuum value to create a singularity . </S>",
    "<S> so unless an infrared - modified @xmath0 model leads to a potential with curvature singularity separated from vacuum by at least @xmath69 one would end up with a curvature singularity _ without horizon _ in a compact astrophysical object like a neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is rather easy to violate unless special care is taken in model - building . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for starobinsky s model ( [ eq : star ] ) with @xmath32 and @xmath39 ( as in figure  [ fig : pot ] ) @xmath70 , and is even smaller for larger values of @xmath44 , for which it decreases as @xmath71 . since in general </S>",
    "<S> one needs @xmath72 for graviton not to be a ghost , one would need @xmath73 to avoid both problems , the prospects of achieving which without fine - tuning do not look good .    </S>",
    "<S> this curvature singularity problem is in no way unique to starobinsky s disappearing cosmological constant model @xcite , which i have taken as an example simply because it is one of the most carefully constructed models so far . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , any infrared - modified @xmath0 gravity model suffers from it . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider arbitrary function @xmath0 , and require that it reduces to einstein gravity for large curvature , and has an analytic expansion @xmath74 with a leading term @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the leading terms for large @xmath5 asymptotic behavior of scalar gravitational degree of freedom ( [ eq : phi ] ) and potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) are @xmath77 the value of @xmath10 goes to zero in large curvature limit , and the potential @xmath11 has power law dependence on @xmath10 @xmath78 with exponent @xmath79 valued between zero and one @xmath80 thus , the values of both the field and the potential at curvature singularity are finite for a generic @xmath0 infrared modification of gravity which recovers einstein gravity perturbatively in the large curvature limit . </S>",
    "<S> this means the arguments i made above apply generically , and viability of many @xmath0 models in current literature will have to be re - evaluated . at the very least , </S>",
    "<S> the bound ( [ eq : bound ] ) will have to be satisfied for the model not to be ruled out immediately . </S>",
    "<S> but even if the estimate for compact objects i made here looks ok , any infrared - modified @xmath0 models should be scrutinized very closely for dangerous curvature singularities that could be present . in a sense , infrared modification of @xmath0 gravity forces one to confront the question of ultraviolet completion of the theory .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let me comment on how this problem looks like in equivalent scalar - tensor theory formulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conformal transformation to an einstein frame with metric @xmath81 turns the scalar degree of freedom into a canonically normalized scalar field @xmath82 with potential @xmath83 the asymptotics of scalar degree of freedom in einstein frame are very similar to the above story : the field @xmath82 goes to zero in large curvature limit , and the potential has the same unprotected power law asymptotic @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> but where did the singularity go ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is subtle : while the conformal factor itself appears to be regular ( @xmath29 ) , its second derivatives are not ( potential derivative blows up as @xmath85 in equation of motion ) , which can cause a curvature singularity in jordan frame even if einstein frame metric was regular . </S>"
