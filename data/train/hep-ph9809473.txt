    "it is widely believed that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory underlying the strong interaction .",
    "regrettably , reliable first principle calculations of hadronic structure and reactions based on qcd are still some time off .",
    "nevertheless , simpler qcd - motivated phenomenological models have been proposed which preserve the important property of chiral symmetry .",
    "familiar examples include skyrme - witten models@xcite and hybrid chiral - soliton models such as those of kahana and ripka @xcite , birse and banerjee@xcite , birse @xcite , fiolhais , goeke , grmmer , and urbano @xcite , goeke , harvey , grmmer , and urbano @xcite hereafter referred to as ghgu and others ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "such approaches , in particular ref.@xcite , argue that spontaneous symmetry breaking of the qcd lagrangian gives rise to an effective chiral lagrangian of the gell - mann - lvy sigma - model form involving explicit quark , scalar - isoscalar meson ( sigma , @xmath1 ) , and pseudoscalar - isovector meson ( pion , @xmath2 ) degrees of freedom . the model has been solved in mean - field using the `` hedgehog '' ansatz which assumes a configuration - space - isospin correlation for the pion field , @xmath3 , and for the quarks .",
    "one drawback to this ansatz is that it breaks both rotational and isospin invariance ( although `` grand spin '' , @xmath4 , remains conserved ) requiring some projection onto physical states at the end .",
    "considerable attention has been given to the problem of projection in the calculation of observables @xcite .    in spite of this drawback",
    "the model is quite successful at predicting baryon properties .",
    "constraining the pion mass and decay constant with experimental values , the model contains but two additional free parameters ( which can be written in terms of the effective quark and sigma masses ) , yet the model makes quite respectable predictions for a host of hadronic properties ( mass , magnetic moments , sigma commutator , pion - nucleon coupling constant ( @xmath5 ) , axial vector coupling constant ( @xmath6 ) , as well as weak and electromagnetic form factors ) .",
    "another criticism of this approach , however , is the approximate treatment of the pion whose very light mass argues for a quantum , as opposed to mean - field , treatment .",
    "however , treating light strongly - coupled fields is in general difficult as perturbative methods are unreliable . in part to address such issues , the coherent - pair approximation was developed by bolsterli @xcite and used by ghgu to treat the pions as true quantum fields non - perturbatively .",
    "we find this approach promising and in this work revisit the hybrid chiral model of goeke , et al .",
    "correcting several errors .",
    "besides the inclusion of quantum pionic degrees of freedom non - perturbatively , another advantage is that one need not invoke the so - called hedgehog ansatz for the pion field .",
    "specifically , the symmetry of the quarks with respect to permutation induces the space - isospin correlations in the pion field . following the ground - breaking work of ghgu , we minimize the chiral hamiltonian with respect to the coherent - pair fock - space ansatz ground - state configuration , then calculate nucleon properties , and compare with other chiral models .",
    "we find that once minimization with respect to the coherence parameter is achieved , the results for calculated observables are not significantly different from those calculated in ghgu .",
    "in addition we present results for the sigma commutator which measures the degree of chiral symmetry breaking",
    ".    for completeness and ease of comparison the organization of this paper closely follows that of ghgu .",
    "we present the starting lagrangian and the major intermediate results , refer the reader to the original paper for details , and note where our results differ from ghgu .",
    "where appropriate , we will give the corresponding ghgu equation references .",
    "we present the background theory in section ii , a summary of the coherent - pair approximation results in section iii , the variational equations in section iv , the derived nucleon properties in section v , the numerical results in section vi , and our summary and conclusions in section vii .",
    "we find that the corrected equations do not significantly alter the results originally reported in ghgu .",
    "when compared with the hedgehog model the coherent - pair approximation shows systematically smaller mesonic contributions to the nucleon observables and the energy densities which may be related to poor self - consistency in the pionic sector .",
    "we begin with the chiral model lagrangian of gell - mann and lvy @xcite but with explicit quark degrees of freedom .",

    "our results are nearly identical despite the differences in several quantities noted previously .",
    "in comparing the predictions of the coherent - pair model to those of the hedgehog model , we find that the quark contributions to each observable are roughly similar ; however the pion contributions are significantly smaller , a feature consistently seen throughout .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the fact that both approaches are attempting to solve the nucleon problem from the same starting model albeit with very different methods and resulting different model parameters .",
    "quantities such as the sigma - commutator which depend on the sigma field are quite similar to that of the hedgehog model , both giving a sigma commutator of roughly 90 mev .",
    "the small pion contributions to the calculated observables seems to be the coherent - pair approximation s principal phenomenological short - coming .",
    "consider the nucleon charge radius squared .",
    "for the hedgehog model the pion s contribution to the proton s charge radius squared is roughly 40% that of the quarks ; while for the coherent - pair approximation the pions contribution is only 4% that of the quarks .",
    "the small pionic contribution is compensated for by a slightly larger quark contribution leaving the total proton charge radius squared very close to that calculated in the hedgehog model , but still about 20% that of the experimental value .",
    "likewise for the magnetic moments .",
    "the quark contribution to the magnetic moments is about the same for both models , but for the hedgehog model the pions make a contribution to the proton magnetic moment which is 65% that of the quarks while for the coherent - pair approximation the pionic contribution is only 12% that of the quarks .",
    "the smaller pionic contribution to the magnetic moments results in magnetic moments roughly 60% that of the empirical values .    for the case of the axial vector coupling constant we find again that the quark contributions in the two models are similar , but the mesonic contribution in the coherent - pair model is only half that of the hedgehog model . in this case",
    "this actually helps in that the hedgehog model predicts too large a value for this quantity .",
    "finally we consider the @xmath0nn coupling constant calculated in two ways first using the pion field itself eq.[59 ] and secondly using the pion source term eq.[60 ] . in the hedgehog model birse found that both methods gave roughly the same value , but in the coherent - pair approximation the two methods give very different results .",

    "reports a fractional virial violation of 173% .",
    "this should be compared with 51% for the mean - field hedgehog model of birse and bannerjee and 6% for the generalized projected hedgehog model of fiolhais et al . using the values in table iii",
    ", we find a fractional virial violation of 149% which is a little better than that previously reported , but still shows a clear and substantial problem with self - consistency in the pion sector .",
    "one must question why this should be so .",
    "that the two models should give such different pionic contributions is a bit puzzling as the starting model is the same and both employ a self - consistent mean - field type approach which minimizes the energy .",
    "in comparing the quark wavefunctions and meson field solutions in the two models one finds , not surprisingly , that the quark wavefunctions and sigma field are nearly identical in the two models , but , though the pion field function in the coherent - pair approximation is smaller by a factor of about two from that found in the hedgehog model , this can not be the source of the discrepancy since the pion field in the coherent - pair approximation is normalized but the magnitude of the pion field ( treated as a classical field ) in the hedgehog model is determined by the source terms . the magnitude of the pionic contribution to any quantity in the coherent - pair approximation is determined by the fock space coefficients , @xmath142 and by the various coherent functions @xmath143 . with the minimized solution around @xmath144",
    "the mean number of pions in the coherent pair approximation case is @xmath145 which apparently yields the small pionic contributions to the various baryon observables .",
    "a comparison of the magnitude of the pion field resulting from the hedgehog model with the normalized field arising in the coherent - pair model would imply an effective number of pions about 3 times greater in the hedgehog model . a preliminary search of the parameter space to see if some other parameter set may correct this deficiency was not successful .",
    "we have examined the model up to a coherence parameter of @xmath60=2.25 .",
    "larger coherence parameters do indeed give rise to greater pionic contributions to the various nucleon observables , but at the expense of greater energy as well .",
    "while the issue is being investigated further , we suspect the problem with self - consistency as revealed in the large fractional virial violation to be the principal difficulty .",
    "another useful comparison is shown in figs .",
    "[ kineticfig ] and [ qmesonfig ] where the energy densities for various terms are shown for both the hedgehog model and the coherent - pair approximation .",
    "again there is a systematically smaller contribution to each term in the coherent - pair model than in the hedgehog model . yet the total energy of both solutions are roughly the same ( 1070 mev and 1120 mev respectively ) .",
    "in this work we re - examined a linear sigma model of the nucleon using quarks and sigma and pion mesons as the fundamental degrees of freedom . to solve this model",
    "we have employed the coherent - pair approximation following the work of goeke , et al . correcting several errors .",
    "we solved the model using a fock space ansatz treating the sigma field as a classical field and treating the pions as quantum fields using the coherent - pair approximation of bolsterli @xcite .",
    "we neglect vacuum effects and center - of - mass corrections . despite the several corrections to the work of goeke , et al . , the numerical solutions we find are very close to those presented in their original paper as are all the calculated nucleon observables .",
    "we find that the calculated nucleon observables are reasonably close to experiment , but , in the case of electromagnetic quantities such as charge radii or magnetic moments , the pionic contributions seem too small when compared to that of other chiral nucleon models such as the hedgehog model of birse and bannerjee .",
    "the origin of this difference is not fully understood but probably arises from the lack of self - consistency in pionic sector using this approach as was noted previously by fiolhais , et al .. therefore , at this stage we must concur with the rather disappointing conclusion of goeke , et al . , namely , that a better description of the pionic sector is required before a more satisfactory nucleon phenomenology can be expected in this model .",
