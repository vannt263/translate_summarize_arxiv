    "there are indications that the efficiency of these current - induced torques ( measured as , for example , the torque per current density ) may be larger than the conventional spin transfer torque.@xcite for this reason among others , these bilayer and related systems offer a possible route for spintronics to fulfill its full promise in technological applications .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in these systems leads to multiple effects .",
    "for one , there is a spin hall effect in the pt layer , so that spin current flows from the pt into the magnetic layer , with spin orientation perpendicular to the charge current direction and the interface normal .",
    "this spin current flux induces magnetization dynamics via the conventional spin transfer torque .",
    "a distinct effect originates from the simultaneous presence of magnetization , spin - orbit coupling , and broken inversion symmetry at the interface .",
    "these ingredients result in an electronic structure in which current carrying states acquire a spin accumulation transverse to the magnetization , resulting in a torque.@xcite both the spin hall effect and interfacial spin - orbit torque are proportional to the charge current .",
    "an additional consequence of the interfacial spin - orbit coupling is the current - independent dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction,@xcite which has been argued to be important@xcite for current - induced domain wall motion .",
    "the vector components of the spin - orbit torques can be decomposed into two vector fields as a function of @xmath0 , the magnetization direction : @xmath1 , which we refer to as a field - like torque and @xmath2 $ ] , which we refer to as a damping - like torque ( @xmath3 is the charge current direction and @xmath4 is the interface normal).@xcite these names derive from the similarity of the first form to the torque due to a field along @xmath5 , and the second to the damping that would result from precession around that field .",

    "et al._@xcite have shown that the physics behind two torque components separate rather cleanly : the damping torque originates predominantly from the spin hall effect , and is a consequence of the perturbation of electronic states by the applied electric field , while the field - like torque originates mostly from the spin - orbit coupling at the interface , in conjunction with the perturbation of the electron distribution function by the applied field . in this paper",

    "we study a variety of structures to reach qualitative conclusions .",
    "our aim with this approach is to extract semi - quantitative estimates of the current - induced torques , and to identify the trends and most important physical mechanisms underlying the current - induced torques .",
    "there is significant mismatch between the lattice constants of bulk co and pt ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "studies of co growth on pt observe a structure that is generally inhomogeneous and quite sensitive to the co coverage.@xcite for simplicity , we assume a uniform co layer with the in - plane pt lattice constant . the distance between interface co and pt layers",

    ".   shows that for co / pt , the even torque is dominated by the spin hall effect and the interfacial contributions are negligible .",
    "we also neglect skew scattering that could also give a spin hall effect .",
    "thus , we only capture the current - induced torque related to the rashba model and neglect all contributions from the spin hall effect in the bulk of the pt .",
    "recent models of this system employing a boltzmann model show that the rashba and spin hall effect torques are largely independent of each other.@xcite we use the approach described here to focus on understanding the contribution to the current - induced torque from the spin - orbit coupling near the interface .",

    "where the calculations can be compared , we find similar results .",
    "the reduced computational demands of our approach enable us to explore a wider range of systems , including different geometries and different magnetization orientations .",

    "we show below that the exchange splitting in the co induces exchange splitting ( and a small moment ) in the pt and that the spin - orbit coupling in the pt induces a transverse moment in the co. of these proximity effects , the transverse moment on the co induced by the spin - orbit coupling in the pt plays the dominant role in determining the current - induced torques .",
    "the layer resolved magnetic moments are shown in fig .",

    "the inequivalence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 directions of our lattice implies that the spins have no such symmetries when the magnetization has a @xmath40 component , so that a spin accumulation of any direction is allowed by symmetry.@xcite this in turn leads to both field - like and damping - like torques . for real systems with disordered interfaces ,",
    "we expect the in - plane direction to be relatively isotropic , so that the odd torque is primarily field - like ( at least within the relaxation time approximation ) .",

    "the sizeable transverse moments of the states , shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] , are the result of the interaction of the co orbitals with the spin - orbit potential localized on the pt .    summing over states",
    "leads to significant cancellation of the torques .",
    "we find that the average absolute value of torque from each state is about 10 to 100 times greater than the integrated total , depending on the specific system . as described in ref .",

    "a current - induced torque from a rashba - like model requires the simultaneous presence of exchange splitting and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it s not _ a priori _ obvious if the induced exchange present in the pt is more or less important than the induced spin - orbit coupling in the co. we first make a general remark about this distinction .",
    "the magnetic proximity effect is one of the most dramatic examples of the effect of hybridization between neighboring materials orbitals .",
    "however , as discussed in ref . , there is a similar energy splitting on the co orbitals due to the interaction with the spin - orbit coupling in the pt .",
    "this effect is not as obvious as the magnetic proximity effect for two reasons : the co levels with which pt hybridize are pure spin states , which leads to appreciable spin splitting for all pt states , and a macroscopic magnetization in the pt interface layer . on the other hand ,",
    "the eigenstates of the atomic spin - orbit potential @xmath51 are those of the total angular momentum operator @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is not a good quantum number in the symmetry broken crystal field , so the pt states with which co hybridize generally do not directly reflect the spin orbit potential .",
    "this obscures the effect of the pt spin - orbit on the levels in the co. despite being less  obvious \" in this way , the proximate effect of the spin - orbit coupling is quite important , as we show next .    to determine the role of magnetic proximity effect , we remove the exchange splitting on the pt atoms from the ground state hamiltonian , and the resulting current - induced torques",

    "( we find that removing the pt spin - orbit potential from the initial ground state and calculating the current - induced torques _ without _ performing a new ground state calculations yields very similar results . )",
    "[ fig : scenarios ] shows the results for the ideal interface .",
    "the current - induced effective field is nearly unchanged when the pt magnetization is removed , and greatly diminished when the pt spin - orbit coupling is removed .",
    "we conclude that the spin - orbit in the pt is the main agent behind the total torque .",
    "we additionally repeat this calculation for an alloyed system , with the layer and atom - resolved torques shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenariosmix ] .",
    "a similar scenario holds in this case .",
    "( note however that the magnitude of the _ total _ torques are not so different in the alloyed case ( see table 1 ) when we remove the spin - orbit from the pt ; this is due to the significant cancelations that occur when adding the contributions from all the states in the default system . )",
    "it s instructive to evaluate the average absolute value of the torque from all states for these different scenarios .",
    "we find the torques are nearly unchanged for no magnetization on pt , while they re about 5 times smaller when the spin - orbit is removed from the pt . to rationalize this result",
    ", we note that the exchange splitting in the pt is 10 times smaller than in the co. on the other hand , the transverse spin density is 3x smaller in the co than in the pt .",
    "these properties of the states indicate that the pt spin - orbit potential is the primary source of the overall torque .",
    "in summary , we performed first principles calculations of the field - like current - induced torque on a series of co - pt bilayers , and from this we conclude that : 1 .",
    "the torque is very sensitive to system details , such as co coverage .",
    "this is consistent with experimental data , and the general magnitude of the calculated effective fields is similar to the experimental values .",
    "the angular dependence of the torque is very similar to that predicted by the simple 2-d rashba model for an ideal interface , but more complicated for alloyed interfaces .",
    "the primary source of the torque is derived from the spin - orbit coupling localized on the pt interface atoms , which affects the nonequilibrium spin density in the co interface layer , and drives the current - induced torques .",
    "the extent to which the trends revealed by the first principles calculations can be made more revealing in simpler models is a question for future work .",
    "in addition , this approach may be used to screen different materials combinations in order to anticipate which materials may show the strongest effect .                                        the choice of vector components along which to project the torque is arbitrary , but the conventional choice described here is convenient for these systems .",
