    "the roots of standard particle physics are expected to go as deep as the planck length of @xmath0  cm where gravity is intimately linked to the particle system .",
    "a stable bridge between the electroweak energy scale of 100  gev and the vastly different planck scale of @xmath1  gev , and the ( nearby ) grand unification scale @xmath2  gev , is provided by supersymmetry .",
    "methods must therefore be developed which allow to study the supersymmetry breaking mechanism and the physics scenario near the gut / pl scale @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of physical structures at energies more than fourteen orders above accelerator energies is a demanding task .",
    "lhc  @xcite and a future e@xmath3e@xmath4 linear collider ( lc )  @xcite are a perfect tandem for solving such a problem : while the colored supersymmetric particles , gluinos and squarks , can be generated with large rates for masses up to 2 to 3  tev at the lhc , the strength of e@xmath3e@xmath4 linear colliders is the comprehensive coverage of the non - colored particles , charginos / neutralinos and sleptons .",
    "if the analyses are performed coherently , the accuracies in measurements of cascade decays at lhc and in threshold production as well as decays of supersymmetric particles at lc complement each other mutually .",
    "a comprehensive and precise picture is needed in order to carry out the evolution of the supersymmetric parameters to high scales , which is driven by perturbative loop effects involving the entire supersymmetric particle spectrum .",
    "minimal supergravity [ msugra ] provides us with a scenario within which these general ideas can be quantified .",
    "supersymmetry is broken in msugra in a hidden sector and the breaking is transmitted to our eigenworld by gravity  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism suggests , yet does not enforce [ see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite ] , the universality of the soft susy breaking parameters  gaugino and scalar masses , trilinear couplings  at a scale that is generally identified with the unification scale .",
    "alternative scenarios have been formulated for left ",
    "right symmetric extensions , superstring effective theories , and for other susy breaking mechanisms .",
    "the msugra snowmass reference point sps1a is characterised by the following values  @xcite @xmath5 for the universal gaugino mass @xmath6 , the scalar mass @xmath7 , the trilinear coupling @xmath8 , the sign of the higgsino parameter @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , the ratio of the vacuum - expectation values of the two higgs fields . as the modulus of the higgsino parameter",
    "is fixed at the electroweak scale by requiring radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath9 is finally given by @xmath11 .",
    "the form of the supersymmetric mass spectrum of sps1a is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sps1a_spectrum ] . in this scenario",
    "the squarks and gluinos can be studied very well at the lhc while the non - colored gauginos and sleptons can be analyzed partly at lhc and in comprehensive form at an e@xmath3e@xmath4 linear collider operating at a total energy up to 1 tev with high integrated luminosity close to 1  ab@xmath12 .      at the masses",
    "can best be obtained by analyzing edge effects in the cascade decay spectra .",
    "the basic starting point is the identification of a sequence of two - body decays : .",
    "one can then measure the kinematic edges of the invariant mass distributions among the two leptons and the jet resulting from the above chain , and thus an approximately model - independent determination of the masses of the involved sparticles is obtained @xcite .",
    "the four sparticle masses [ @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are used subsequently as input for additional decay chains like , and the shorter chains and , which all require the knowledge of the sparticle masses downstream of the cascades .",
