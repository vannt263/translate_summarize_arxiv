    "the formation and evolution of galaxies is regulated by their feedback on the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "radiative feedback owing to photo - ionization heating by a cosmic uv background or hydrodynamic feedback owing to outflows driven by supernovae or quasars , can suppress the infall of igm gas onto low - mass dark - matter halos ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the feedback introduces a minimum halo mass above which halos can efficiently accrete gas from the igm and host star formation or quasar activity .",
    "infall of gas is suppressed if the gravitational potential well of a halo is shallow , explaining why dwarf galaxies have a much lower abundance than expected for low - mass halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we examine a simple observational method to reveal the scars left by hydrodynamic outflows from galaxies on the igm .",
    "powerful outflows from galaxies are expected to push away the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) around those galaxies , and produce absorption - free gaps in the ly@xmath0 forest towards a background quasar @xcite .",
    "studies of the ly@xmath0 forest  the narrow absorption lines produced by intergalactic neutral hydrogen in quasar spectra  had been very successful in mapping large scale structure in the universe at high redshift ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "while the igm dynamics is shaped by gravity alone on large scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , outflows can play an important role on small scales by introducing gaps in the ly@xmath0 forest that can be identified in high resolution observations of quasar spectra .",
    "our model is simple : an outflow from a galaxy evacuates a bubble in the igm , leaving behind little or no neutral hydrogen as the swept - away gas piles up on the bubble surface .",
    "such a bubble would appear as a gap in the ly@xmath0 forest absorption spectrum of a background quasar , i.e. , a flat spectral segment with little or no absorption .",
    "the expected distribution of absorption - free gaps can be calculated from the number density of halos above the minimum mass , as only those halos are capable of hosting supernova or quasar - driven outflows . for the halo mass range of interest , @xmath4@xmath5",
    ", the bubble radius is expected to be almost independent of halo mass at a given redshift ( furlanetto & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "hence , our analytic model has only two free parameters : the minimum halo mass for the production of outflows , @xmath6 , and the characteristic bubble radius @xmath7 for halos above that mass .",
    "there have already been some observational reports about the signatures of outflows around massive starburst galaxies ( with @xmath8 ) at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite discovered large scale outflows with velocities up to @xmath9 by studying @xmath10 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath11 . using a large sample of quasar spectra which pass by foreground lbgs",
    ", @xcite identified the lack of neutral hydrogen within @xmath12 comoving mpc around lbgs .",
    "recent observations of high redshift , submillimeter galaxies also indicated the existence of large scale outflows ( see , @xcite and reference therein ) . the properties of active bubbles around starburst galaxies may be different than those of mature bubbles around more common galaxies for which the wind material had sufficient time to accumulate on the bubble walls and decelerate after evacuating the bubble interior . in simulations ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite also found absorption - free gaps in their simulated ly@xmath0 spectrum caused by galactic winds .",
    "our goal in this _",
    "letter _ is to characterize the properties of the typical relic bubbles around the most common ( @xmath13 ) galaxies at redshift @xmath14 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : calc ] we briefly describe our analytic model and derive its basic equations . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we compare the model with three high - resolution quasar spectra .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion about the assumptions of our model and the implications of our results . throughout the paper , we assume the concordance cosmological model with @xmath15 determined by recent _ wmap _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "in our simple model , a galactic wind sweeps - up the surrounding intergalactic medium and eliminates hi absorption within a bubble radius @xmath7 of order a few hundred kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bubble spends most of the time approaching a fixed comoving distance from its host galaxy , at which the ( decelerating ) expansion speed asymptotes to the local hubble velocity ( see section [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "such a bubble would produce a gap in the ly@xmath0 forest imprinted on the spectrum of a background quasar .",
    "the absorption - free gap should have a high value of the mean transmission @xmath16 [ defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the optical depth ] that is close to unity .",
    "our goal is to calculate the expected size distribution of such gaps in the ly@xmath0 forest and compare it with observations .    given a comoving density of halos per unit mass of @xmath19 and the assumption that the wind from each halo of mass @xmath20 produces bubble of a comoving radius of @xmath21 , the probability of finding an absorption - free gap ( with @xmath22 ) of comoving size in the range between @xmath23 and @xmath24 per infinitesimal comoving path - length , @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the cross - section of the bubble for an impact parameter @xmath28 , and @xmath6 is the minimum halo mass into which igm gas accretes efficiently .",
    "the differential cross - section for having a bubble segment of length between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is then , @xmath29 the expected number of absorption - free gaps with a size larger than @xmath23 is @xmath30 since @xmath21 has a rather weak dependence on @xmath20 across the relevant range of halo masses ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) , we assume for simplicity a single value for @xmath7 when fitting observational data at a given redshift . we adopt the @xcite mass function of halos and",
    "use @xmath6 as the second adjustable parameter .",
    "the concordance cosmological model yields the following values for the cumulative number density : @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xmath33 , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows results from equation  ( [ eq : cumul ] ) for the three cases of @xmath36 ( dashed line ) , @xmath37 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath38 ( solid line ) .",
    "next , we apply our analytic method to three high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath39 ) spectra : q  1422 + 231 at @xmath40 @xcite ; q  0130 - 4021 at @xmath41 and q  0741 + 4741 at @xmath42 ( @xcite ) . these quasar were observed with the keck high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) , at @xmath39 of @xmath43 .",
    "the resolution for q  1422 + 231 is @xmath44 kpc , and for the other two is @xmath45 .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite and @xcite for details of continuum fitting . by fit artificial spectra for 24 qsos",
    ", @xcite measured a typical error in continuum level of 1.2% .",
    "the actually error in our sample should be much smaller due to the higher @xmath39 .",
    "we select a portion of the spectrum around @xmath11 to test our analytic model .",
    "specifically , we consider the observed wavelength band of @xmath46  , corresponding to a comoving path length of @xmath47 mpc . for q  0130 - 4021 and q  0741 + 4741 , only ly@xmath0 absorption presents in this wavelength range , while for q  1422 + 231 , ly@xmath48 will cover part of this range ( but not ly@xmath49 ) and will have quite a bit more aborption .",
    "we split the spectrum into segments with a size of @xmath50 mpc each so that we have a total of 9 segments for the entire sample .",
    "we then normalize each of the 9 segments separately .",
    "we did this by varying the optical depth @xmath18 so that the mean flux @xmath51 , consistent with the observed value at @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we did not vary the normalization with wavelength .",
    "we measure gaps in each segment , and the errors are estimated by using the variance between these 9 subsamples .",
    "we directly measure @xmath53 from the observed spectrum .",
    "the flat absorption - free gaps are selected by searching for segments with transmission @xmath54 where @xmath55 is our fiducial threshold .",
    "other choices of the threshold transmission may be considered plausible , since @xcite found that the mean transmitted flux is @xmath56 within 0.5 @xmath57 comoving mpc of the lbgs and possibly higher close to the lbgs .",
    "note that since lbgs are selected by having ongoing starburst activity , their active wind may add some absorption by outflowing material inside their bubbles .",
    "other galaxies are most likely to be surrounded by empty relic bubbles bounded by a thin shell of swept - up gas , long after their powerful starburst activity has ended . however , a low value of @xmath58 is very likely to mix the outflow - driven bubbles discussed here with high - transmission gaps caused by gravitationally - induced voids ( which are underdense but not completely empty ) .",
    "we have chosen the threshold of 0.99 based on a detailed analysis of the results of a numerical simulation from a particle - mesh ( pm ) code involves gravity only ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the pm simulation provides the same distribution of gaps as the data up to a threshold of @xmath590.97 , and the data shows a clear over - abundance of gaps at a threshold of 0.99 : at @xmath55 the gravity - induced gaps accounts for less than @xmath59 10% of the total gaps found in the observation data .    in principle",
    "we could have used the raw spectrum , the noise in each pixel generates artificial gaps with a width of just a few pixels .",
    "instead , we use the fitted spectrum , which smoothes out these random pixel noise . using high - order statistic method",
    ", @xcite found that the coherence scale length of spatial correlation in keck data must be smaller than 0.3@xmath57 mpc , which roughly corresponds to 12 pixels in the spectrum .",
    "so the raw spectrum is smoothed by the boxcar method with a width of 12 pixels to ensure that we can smooth poisson noise in each pixel but preserve the large scale features .",
    "the 1-@xmath60 error bars are obtained directly from poisson statistics .",
    "we fit the observed distribution of gap sizes using equation  ( [ eq : cumul ] ) , with two free parameters : @xmath61 and @xmath7 .",
    "we use a least-@xmath62 analysis with @xmath63 ^ 2/\\sigma_i^2.\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is the expected value of @xmath65 based on equation  ( [ eq : cumul ] ) , @xmath66 is the observed value of @xmath65 , and @xmath67 is the 1-@xmath60 error for each data point .",
    "the @xmath62 fit yields the best - fit parameters of @xmath68 and @xmath69 comoving kpc , with a @xmath62 value of 1.2 per degree - of - freedom .",
    "the model fits the observation data well between 0.1 and 1 @xmath57 mpc at @xmath70 implies that the chance for overlap of bubbles with a radius @xmath71 comoving kpc around these galaxies , is small in our data set . ] , as indicated by the red solid line in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "the best - fit value for the minimum halo mass that is capable of hosting outflows ( due to star formation or quasar activity ) , is consistent with the value expected from hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic analysis .",
    "the mass of a dark matter halo is related to its circular velocity @xmath72 and collapse redshift @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 the infall of gas onto dwarf galaxies is significantly suppressed through photoionization heating of the igm by the cosmic ultraviolet background radiation after cosmological reionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "as soon as the igm is heated to a temperature of @xmath76@xmath77 k , its thermal pressure suppresses gas infall into shallow gravitational potential wells .",
    "the minimum halo mass due to photo - ionization heating corresponds to a virial temperature of @xmath78 k. the reason is that photo - ionization heats the igm to @xmath79 k but when the gas virializes into a halo , its density increases by a factor of @xmath80 and so its temperature rises adiabatically by a factor @xmath81 .",
    "only if this final temperature is below the virial temperature , will the gas condense by this factor of @xmath80 .",
    "the minimum halo mass for galaxies is defined as the threshold where @xmath82% of the baryons that were supposed to condense made it .",
    "this gives a minimum virial temperature of @xmath78 k. the corresponding minimum circular velocity of the halo is @xcite , @xmath83 detailed hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) confirm this value , showing that at redshift @xmath52 only @xmath84 of the available gas accretes onto halos with @xmath85 , and the infall of gas onto halos with @xmath86@xmath87 is completely suppressed .",
    "this yields a minimum halos mass of @xmath88 based on equation  ( [ eq : minm ] ) , in agreement with the value derived from the statistics of absorption - free gaps in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the typical bubble radius @xmath7 we derived is consistent with both semi - analytic analysis and other observations .",
    "based on a starburst wind model , @xcite showed that at redshift @xmath11 and halos with masses between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the physical ( proper ) radius @xmath91 ranges between @xmath59 50 to @xmath92 kpc ( see the upper left panel of their fig .",
    "1 ) . for halo masses above @xmath93 , the maximum radius can be achieved by the wind is nearly constant , @xmath92 kpc .",
    "observations indicate the lack of within a radius of 500 comoving kpc around lbgs , which translates to @xmath94 proper kpc at @xmath52 @xcite , although the interpretation may be complicated @xcite .",
    "the gas that is swept - up from the bubble volume by a galactic outflow , is expected to pile - up in a thin shell on the bubble wall , and introduce enhanced absorption at both ends of its absorption - free segment in the ly@xmath0 forest @xcite .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of q  1422 + 231 indicates that almost all of the flat transmission segments have deep absorption features at one or both of their boundaries .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows four examples of absorption - free segments with enhanced absorption at both ends . in all panels ,",
    "the upper dotted horizontal line show the flux threshold @xmath55 , and the lower horizontal line indicates the mean transmitted flux of @xmath51 at @xmath95 ( bottom ) .",
    "we note that in analogy with supernova remnants @xcite , the shell of the swept - up material may fragment into clumps due to convective or rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "in such a case , a flat ( absorption - free ) segment would be bounded by a narrow , deep absorption feature only if the line - of - sight happens to cross a clump of gas .",
    "we find that out of 23 absorption - free segments with @xmath96 mpc , 6 are bounded at both ends by deep absorption features extending under @xmath97 , 12 have such a feature at one end , and only 5 are not bounded at all by a flux depression under @xmath97 .",
    "there is tentative evidence for clumpiness of the bubble walls , although the last class of segments may also receive a contribution from ionization ( strmgren ) spheres around bright galaxies .",
    "our analysis assumed that the bubble size can be translated to the spectral width of the absorption - free gaps for a pure hubble flow , and ignored the possible effects peculiar velocities . in reality , the spectral width may be increased due to the bubble expansion relative to the local hubble flow .",
    "this would tend to increase the inferred value of @xmath7 relative to its true physical size .",
    "the local hubble flow at @xmath11 is @xmath98 for bubbles with a radius of @xmath92 proper kpc .",
    "the upper left panel of figure 2 in @xcite shows that for most halos with halo mass between @xmath99@xmath100 the average bubble expansion velocity is around @xmath101 .",
    "since the peculiar velocity , @xmath102 , is much smaller than the hubble flow @xmath103 , we can safely ignore its contribution to the broadening of the flat spectral segments . on the other hand , neutral hydrogen outside the bubble may also have effect in translating the bubble size into the spectral width of the gap , depending on whether the bubble is expanding into an infall region ( surrounding an overdense environment ) or an outflow region ( in a locally underdense region ) : the infall can require the true physical bubble size to be larger ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we have only attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of our method at @xmath70 .",
    "the statistical significance of our results can be enhanced through the analysis of additional data sets of high - resolution quasar spectra .",
    "we also need better calibrated data , with accurate continuum level , and more realistic simulatoins . in the future",
    ", our method can be used to measure the variation of @xmath104 and @xmath7 with redshift , and to gauge the impact of galaxy feedback on estimates of the dark matter power - spectrum on small scales .",
