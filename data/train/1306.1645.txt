    "in recent years , many studies on ultradiscrete integrable systems , or integrable cellular automata have intensively been made by using various mathematical tools such as combinatorics @xcite , ultradiscretization procedure @xcite , crystal bases of quantum groups @xcite , and so forth .",
    "in particular , among many studies on geometric aspects of ultradiscrete integrable systems , several remarkable works have successively been made by kimijima - tokihiro @xcite , inoue - takenawa @xcite , and iwao @xcite in terms of tropical geometry and ultradiscretization procedure . they have solved the initial value problems to box - ball systems with periodic boundary conditions ( abbreviated as periodic box - ball systems or pbbs shortly ) by using tropical hyperelliptic curves , their tropical jacobians , ultradiscrete theta functions , and ultradiscretization of abelian integrals . through their works , we have gradually recognized the advantage in applying the method of tropical geometry to ultradiscrete integrable systems .",
    "therefore , when we focused our interest on the geometric aspect of ultradiscrete integrable systems we usually chose the framework of tropical geometry as the analysis tool @xcite .    in this paper , we will go a step further and try to realize a pbbs in the framework of tropical geometry more precisely . here",
    "a ` precise ' geometric realization means that we will give the time evolution of the pbbs not by linear flows on the tropical jacobian but by tropical curve intersections .",
    "if we try to do so we immediately notice that the task is not so easy , because to find tropical curve intersections equivalent to the time evolution of the pbbs is essentially the same as to obtain the general solution to a simultaneous system of piecewise linear equations .",
    "( note that we do not have a cramer - type formula for such a system of equations . ) however , preceding studies on ultradiscrete systems shed light on us and we found a short cut .",
    "we first establish a geometric realization of the periodic discrete toda lattice ( abbreviated as pdtl ) , whose ultradiscretization gives the pbbs , by using curve intersections .",
    "we then apply the ultradiscretization procedure to the members in the curve intersections , and finally obtain a geometric realization of the pbbs in terms of tropical curve intersections .    to carry out our plan , this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review the basic results concerning addition of points on hyperelliptic curves in section [ sec : aoh ] . in section [ sec : grpdtl ] , we then introduce the pdtl and investigate its spectral curve and the conserved quantities . in section [ sec : grpdtl ] , we establish curve intersections equivalent to the time evolution of the pdtl .",
    "we then focus on ultradiscrete systems . in section [ sec : athcpbs ]",
    ", we introduce the pbbs and its spectral curve and review addition of points on tropical hyperelliptic curves .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : agrop ] , we apply the procedure of ultradiscretization to the rational functions which appear in the geometric realization of the pdtl . then the geometric framework of the pdtl can naturally be translated into that of tropical geometry , and we obtain a geometric realization of the pbbs by using tropical curve intersections .",
