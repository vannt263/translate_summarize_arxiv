    "from a stellar population point of view , the large bulges of sa galaxies closely resemble elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if this similarity extends into the x - ray regime . with the launch of _ chandra _ ,",
    "our view of the x - ray emission from elliptical galaxies has become considerably clearer .",
    "the nature of the x - ray emission from x - ray bright ( high x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio , @xmath9 ) elliptical galaxies had been known since the days of the _ einstein observatory _ to be primarily from hot @xmath10 k gas ( e.g. , forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ) , with a small percentage of the flux from a harder component ( presumably the integrated emission from a collection of low - mass x - ray binaries , hereafter lmxbs ; matsumoto et al .",
    "however , only _ chandra s _",
    "@xmath11 spatial resolution was able to resolve the x - ray emission from x - ray faint ( low @xmath9 ) elliptical and s0 galaxies into its constituent parts . in the x - ray faint elliptical galaxy ngc  4697",
    "_ chandra _ found that a majority of the x - ray emission emanated from a collection of point sources , primarily lmxbs , with the remaining x - ray emission from a lower temperature diffuse interstellar medium ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 ; hereafter sib00 ) . in these galaxies , much of the hot interstellar medium",
    "has apparently been removed , leaving behind the x - ray binaries as the primary x - ray emission mechanism .",
    "whether spiral bulges more closely resemble the gas - rich x - ray bright elliptical galaxies or the stellar - dominated x - ray faint galaxies remains undetermined .",
    "previous work with _ einstein",
    "_ indicated that the average x - ray temperature of sa galaxies was intermediate between elliptical galaxies and later - type spiral galaxies ( kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "further comparisons with _ rosat",
    "_ revealed that the bulges of the two optically brightest sa galaxies ( ngc  1291 and ngc  3623 ) and the bulge of m31 had similar @xmath9 values and x - ray colors as x - ray faint elliptical galaxies ( irwin & sarazin 1998a , b ) .",
    "recent _ rosat _ hri observations of ngc  1291 found that the radial surface brightness distribution of the x - rays followed a de vaucouleurs profile suggesting that stellar x - ray sources were responsible for the observed x - ray emission ( hogg et al .",
    "2001 ) , although _ rosat _ pspc data indicated that x - ray spectrum softened with increasing radius , which would not be expected from a purely stellar component ( bregman , hogg , & roberts 1995 ) .",
    "but whether the x - ray emission from spiral bulges is dominated by a stellar component can only be confirmed using the excellent spatial resolution of _",
    "chandra_. here , we present a _",
    "observation of the nearby sa galaxy ngc  1291 to resolve the question of the x - ray emission in spiral galaxies with large bulges .",
    "ngc  1291 is the optically brightest sa galaxy in the revised shapley ames catalog with a corrected apparent magnitude of @xmath12 .",
    "detailed optical imaging by de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) revealed a central lens surrounded by a large outer ring from which two faint spiral arms emanate .",
    "sometimes classified as a transitional sb(s)0/sa galaxy , there are no other optically bright galaxies in velocity space near ngc  1291 , although recently a large concentration of faint low surface brightness galaxies have been found around ngc  1291 ( kambas et al .  2000 ) .",
    "the distance to ngc  1291 is uncertain , and literature values range from 6.9 mpc to 13.8 mpc .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) gives a distance of 8.9 mpc by assuming that the brightest stars in the weak spiral arms of ngc  1291 have an absolute magnitude of @xmath13 , and this is the distance we have assumed for this work .",
    "the corrected galactocentric velocity is 674 km s@xmath6 ( de vaucouleurs 1975 ) . at a distance of 8.9 mpc",
    ", 1@xmath14 corresponds to 2.6 kpc .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on x - ray sources and diffuse emission seen in projection within the optical bulge of ngc  1291 .",
    "we will define the bulge to be the region within an ellipse centered on the optical nucleus , with major and minor axes of 45 and 37 , respectively , and at a position angle of @xmath15 ( de vaucouleurs 1975 ) .",
    "ngc  1291 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) onboard _ chandra _ at two epochs , on 2000 june 2728 , and again on 2000 november 7 . the first observation ( hereafter ob1 )",
    "was awarded to us in ao-1 of _ chandra _ , while the second observation    3.10truein    ( hereafter ob2 ) was graciously donated to the _ chandra _ archive early by andrea prestwich .",
    "ob1 contained one small background flare , while over a third of ob2 was taken during times of high background .",
    "the total usable exposure for ob1 and ob2 was 37,409 seconds and 23,016 seconds , respectively .",
    "both ob1 and ob2 were taken when the focal plane temperature was 120@xmath16 c. the observations were combined for the spatial analysis , and treated separately for the spectral analysis .",
    "we present data only from the backside - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "exposure maps were generated to correct the images for vignetting .",
    "an exposure map appropriate for an energy of 0.75 kev was generated for soft energy images , while an exposure map appropriate for an energy of 3 kev was created for hard energy images .",
    "the newest spectral responses available ( acisd2000 - 01 - 29fef_pin0002.fits ) were used in the spectral analysis .",

    "adaptively - smoothed images of the inner @xmath26 for two energy bands ( 0.31.0 kev and 1.56.0 kev ) are shown in figure  [ fig : adapt ] .",
    "the images illustrate the major x - ray - emitting components of the galaxy : a very bright central point source ( most likely an active galactic nucleus ) , many fainter point sources ( most of which are lmxbs in ngc  1291 ) , and centrally - concentrated diffuse emission that is much more pronounced in the soft band .",
    "the diffuse emission is more or less circularly symmetric , although there are some asymmetries at intermediate radii .",
    "these asymmetries argue that the origin of most of the soft emission is hot gas rather than from a stellar component ( which should be distributed like the optical light ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the majority of the asymmetric diffuse emission is from unresolved sources below the detection limit , since similar diffuse features are not seen in the 1.56.0 kev image . nor is it likely that sources below the detection threshold of this observation have extremely soft spectra , since our preliminary work on sources in the bulge of m31 shows that there is no softening of lmxb spectra for sources with luminosities down to @xmath27 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "the gas is contained almost entirely within the optical confines of the bulge , which is shown in figure  [ fig : adapt ] .",

    "for the count  to  luminosity conversion , we assume 1 count s@xmath32 ergs s@xmath6 ( 0.310 kev band ) except for the central source , where we assume a spectrum based on the spectral fit for that source (   [ ssec : central_spec ] ) .",
    "we constructed the luminosity function of the bulge x - ray sources .",
    "since the luminosity of lmxbs in our own galaxy can vary on timescales shorter than a few months , it is unclear whether merging the two observations will lead to an accurate assessment of the luminosity function of the sources in ngc  1291 .",
    "ideally one wants the instantaneous distribution of the luminosities , so we analyze only sources detected in the longer of the two observations , ob1 ( although it should be noted that the luminosity function of ob1+ob2 was not substantially different from that of ob1 alone ) . the cumulative luminosity function for the 47 non - central sources detected in ob1",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : xlf ] . the central source was not included , as it is most likely an agn .",
    "the luminosity function is roughly a power - law between @xmath33 ergs s@xmath6 and @xmath34 ergs s@xmath6 .",

    "the luminosity function also may flatten somewhat below @xmath0@xmath33 ergs s@xmath6 . however , it is possible that this is due to incompleteness near the detection threshold ( @xmath30 ergs s@xmath6 ) , which might be due to the increase in the width of the instrumental point - spread function with distance from the center , or to reduced point - source sensitivity in regions of high diffuse surface brightness .",
    "simulations suggest that incompleteness affects the luminosity function up to a luminosity of about 1.5 times the detection threshold ( e.g. , blanton , sarazin , & irwin 2001 ) .",
    "thus , we will only fit the observed luminosity function for @xmath36 ergs s@xmath6 .",

    "thus , we tried such a broken power - law , and it gave an acceptable fit .",
    "however , the power - law exponent above the break was very steep ; best - fit exponent was @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the ngc  1291 source luminosity function effectively is cut - off above @xmath0@xmath35 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "we tried fitting the luminosity function as a single power - law with a high luminosity cut - off , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the x - ray luminosity ( 0.310 kev ) in units of @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 , and @xmath42 is the cut - off luminosity .",

    "3.30truein    in figure  [ fig : colors ] we plot the x - ray colors of the point sources found in the ob1+ob2 observation for the 48 sources found within the bulge .",
    "we define three x - ray bands , s ( 0.31.0 kev ) , m ( 1.02.0 kev ) , and h ( 2.06.0 kev ) , and create two x - ray colors , h21 = ( m  s)/(m+s ) and h32 = ( h  s)/(h+s ) .",
    "these are the same bands and colors defined in sib00 , except for the upper energy limit of band h , where we exclude energies above 6.0 kev to reduce noise .",
    "this has only a minimal effect on h31 .",
    "the sources occupy a rather narrow band in color space , as was found for the sources in ngc  4697 and ngc  1553 ( sib01 ; blanton et al .",
    "the source located at @xmath46 is a supersoft source , similar to those found in the large magellanic cloud and m31 ( e.g. , kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) , and has no detectable emission above 1 kev .",
    "the colors predicted from a power law with a range of exponents is also shown in figure  [ fig : colors ] .",
    "the colors of the central source ( largest circle ) indicates a rather hard spectrum , although somewhat more band s emission than might be expected .",
    "a detailed spectrum of this source is presented in ",
    "[ ssec : central_spec ] below .",
    "four sources have h31 values of 1 ( no band h emission ) and h21 between 0.2 and 0.4 .",
    "three of these sources are on the outskirts of the bulge and might therefore be unrelated to ngc  1291 ( a similar population of sources was found at larger radii in ngc  4697 ; sib01 ) .",
    "we compared the positions of the x - ray point sources to objects found on the digital sky survey ( dss ) images .",
    "none of the 47 non - central point sources in the bulge of ngc  1291 have optical counterparts that are detectable on the dss images .",
    "however , this is not surprising since faint optical sources would be difficult to detect in the high optical surface brightness bulge .",
    "of the 43 sources outside the bulge , only three had optical counterparts within @xmath47 , whose coordinates were obtained from the usno - a2.0 optical catalog ( monet et al .",
    "all three optical sources were very red , and might be globular clusters belonging to ngc  1291 . a significantly higher percentage of the x - ray sources in the outer regions of ngc  4697 and ngc  1553 are potentially associated with a globular cluster than was found for ngc  1291 .",

    "data , so it was possible to identify fainter candidate globular clusters .",
    "we were unable to find a globular cluster list for ngc  1291 in the literature , and it is likely that several more of the x - ray sources detected in the outer regions of ngc  1291 also belong to globular clusters .      since the soft band x - ray emission is roughly circularly symmetric , we extracted a radial surface brightness profile in circularly - concentric annular rings centered on the center of ngc  1291 , and excluded all point sources detected at the @xmath48 level .",
    "the soft band emission was detectable out to a radius of 120@xmath1 , after which the emission flattened to a constant value .",
    "we chose an annular region 140@xmath49 in extent as our background region , being sure to omit the part of this region that was not covered by both observations .",
    "the raw and the background - subtracted surface brightness profiles for the soft band are shown in figure  [ fig : soft_profile ] .",

    "in fact , extrapolating the luminosity function ( see   [ ssec : sources ] ) of the resolved sources down to @xmath50 ergs s@xmath6 predicted a value for the luminosity for the unresolved sources that was within 4% of the    3.35truein    measured value for the diffuse hard emission . the diffuse emission in the soft band , however , is a combination of hot gas and unresolved sources .",
    "we can use the observed radial profile of the 1.56 kev emission to correct the 0.31.0 kev radial profile for stellar contamination .",
    "we assume that the ratio of 0.31.0 kev/1.56.0 kev count flux is the same for the unresolved point sources as it is for the resolved point sources , and multiply the hard radial profile by this ratio    3.35truein    before subtracting it from the soft radial profile to yield the gas - only radial profile .",

    "the spectrum from the bright central point source could not be fit well with any single component model in the 0.510 kev energy range .",

    "these values are quite unlike those of the summed non - central point source spectrum in ngc  1291 , which was fit well by a thermal model of similar temperature but with only galactic absorption .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity of the central source decreased by a factor of two between ob1 and ob2 , from @xmath108 ergs s@xmath6 to @xmath109 ergs s@xmath6 ( for the power law model ) .",

    "after fixing the absorption and power law exponent , we added a mekal component with a temperature of 0.34 kev to model the hot ism gas expected in the @xmath103 extraction region , and fixed the normalization so that this component yielded 50 counts .",
    "we then added another mekal model and allowed the temperature and metallicity to vary .",
    "this component was absorbed by a column density equal to the galactic column density in that direction .",
    "the best - fit mekal temperature was @xmath112 kev and the best - fit metallicity was @xmath113 solar ( @xmath114 for 69 degrees of freedom ) . substituting a blackbody model for the second mekal model yielded a somewhat worse but still acceptable fit with @xmath115 kev .",
    "the luminosity of the soft component was @xmath116 ergs s@xmath6 , or 5%10% of the hard component luminosity .",

    "this luminosity is also approximately the eddington luminosity of a 1.4 m@xmath124 neutron star .",
    "sib00 suggest that this break represents a division between lmxbs with black hole and neutron star accreters .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , it would mean that ngc  1291 does not have any black hole binaries accreting near the eddington limit .",
    "it is worth noting that the inner @xmath125 of the bulge of the spiral galaxy m31 also does not contain any x - ray source more luminous than @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 ( primini et al .  1993 ; after converting their 0.24.0 kev luminosity to 0.310 kev luminosity ) .",
    "another illustrative way of presenting the luminosity distribution function is shown in figure  [ fig : cumul]_a _ , where we have plotted the cumulative @xmath9 value of sources in the galaxy as a function of increasing @xmath18 .",
    "since we have normalized the x - ray luminosity of the sources by the optical luminosity of the galaxy we can now compare the curve to those of other galaxies .",

    "the galactic reddening maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) indicated an absorption of @xmath129 magnitude . correcting for foreground reddening and assuming a distance of 8.9 mpc",

    "schlegel et al .  (",
    "1998 ) claim a mean uncertainty of 16% of @xmath129 , or 0.009 magnitude .",

    "two striking features stand out in figure  [ fig : cumul]_a_. the total cumulative @xmath9 value of ngc  1291 is a factor of 1.4 less than ngc  4697 and ngc  1553 . as mentioned above ,",
    "this is the result of a lack of very luminous sources in    6.00truein    ngc  1291 .",
    "this is surprising considering the optical characteristics of early - type systems are very similar .",
    "however , for some reason ngc  1291 does not have any of the brightest ( probable ) black hole binaries that other galaxies have .",
    "all three galaxies show a substantial spread in the number and luminosity of sources above @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 , the break luminosity discussed above . also , below @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 the slope of the cumulative @xmath9 values of ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 are quite similar ( ngc  1553 is too distant and the observation time was too short to test this with this galaxy too ) .",
    "in fact , if the distance to ngc  4697 is changed from 15.9 mpc ( the distance assumed by sib01 , which is the recessional velocity distance determined using a value of @xmath132 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ; faber et al . 1989 ) to 11.7 mpc ( the distance implied by the surface brightness fluctuation method ; tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) , the agreement in the cumulative @xmath9 profiles of ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 at low luminosities is remarkable .",
    "this indicates that the number of faint lmxbs agrees quite well between the two galaxies , if the smaller distance for ngc  4697 is adopted .",
    "the discrepancy in the number of luminous sources in ngc  1291 can be reconciled with those of ngc  4697 and ngc  1553 if we assume a larger distance to ngc  1291 than 8.9 mpc .",
    "if we increase the distance by 40% to 12.5 mpc , we find nine sources above @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "however , this creates another problem . although the total cumulative @xmath9 value is independent of distance , the curve shifts to the right when the distance is increased .",
    "when the distance to ngc  1291 is changed from 8.9 mpc , the agreement in the cumulative @xmath9 value below @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 is destroyed . regardless of the chosen distance , the data conclusively show that the production of lmxbs in ngc  1291 differs from that in ngc  4697 .",
    "if the distance is set to match the low end of the luminosity distribution function , too few bright sources are produced in ngc  1291 . if the distance is set to match the high end , too few fainter ( @xmath133 erg s@xmath6 ) sources are produced in ngc  1291",
    "moreover , the shape of the upper end of the luminosity function of ngc  1291 disagrees with that of ngc  4697 (   [ ssec : sources ] ) , independent of the distance .    assuming the distances of 8.9 mpc and 11.7 mpc to ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 , respectively ,",
    "are correct , the excellent agreement in the cumulative @xmath9 value below @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 between ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 ( figure  [ fig : cumul]_a _ ) suggests that this feature can be used to estimate the distance to nearby galaxies .",
    "if the cumulative @xmath9 value below @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 is a constant from galaxy to galaxy , the point where the cumulative @xmath9 value begins to diverge might be used as a standard candle .",
    "using x - ray binaries as a standard candle is not a new concept .",
    "margon & ostriker ( 1973 ) suggested that the luminosity of x - ray sources in galaxies could be limited by the eddington luminosity based on observations of x - ray sources in the local group .",
    "more recently , sib00 suggested that the break in the luminosity distribution function at @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 might be used as a distance indicator too .",
    "the accuracy of this method , however , would always be limited by the relatively small number of sources above the break .",
    "the statistics on sources below the break are generally much better , and are further improved by the summing up the luminosities .",
    "what is required observationally is to resolve the luminosity function down to @xmath134@xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 , and to determine accurately the total amount of x - ray emission from unresolved sources .",
    "this method could be used in conjunction with the break in the luminosity function method of sib00 for greater accuracy .",
    "figure  [ fig : cumul]_b _ zooms in on the lower left corner of figure  [ fig : cumul]_a _ , illustrating how sensitive the cumulative @xmath9@xmath18 relation is to distance . changing the assumed distance of ngc  1291 by @xmath135 leads to an easily measurable difference in the cumulative @xmath9 values of ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 . of course",
    "claims of the validity of this method are premature considering that only two galaxies have been tested thus far .",
    "many more galaxies will need to be compared to ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 to confirm this method .",
    "however , should this method be valid , distances to nearby galaxies can be determined to better than 10% accuracy , and would be one of the very few non - optical methods for determining distances to galaxies .",
    "we point out that the cumulative @xmath9 method is a relative distance estimator , while the method using the break in the luminosity function is an absolute distance estimator .",
    "admittedly , the distance to ngc  1291 is not known with great accuracy , but if this distance estimator method works , we can determine accurate relative distances to these galaxies . in future work , we will study galaxies for which multiple distance estimators already exist and agree with one another and apply our method to them .",
    "also useful will be galaxies that are known to be at the same distance ( owing to their group membership ) .",
    "recently , white , kulkarni , & sarazin ( 2002 ; in preparation ) have found a correlation between the total lmxb @xmath9 value and the specific frequency of globular clusters in a galaxy .",
    "in addition , angelini , loewenstein , & mushotzky ( 2001 ) found that 70% of the x - ray point sources found in a portion of ngc  1399 for which _",
    "hubble _ data existed were coincident with globular clusters of ngc  1399 .",
    "both these results would seem to be at odds with the idea that the cumulative @xmath9 profile below @xmath41",
    "ergs s@xmath6 is uniform from galaxy to galaxy",
    ". one might expect @xmath18 to scale with the globular cluster specific frequency in addition to the optical luminosity @xmath126 rather than @xmath126 alone , rendering the distance estimator method useless in its current form .",
    "however , it is possible that both theories are correct .",
    "it is known that the specific frequency of globular clusters decreases with decreasing radius in galaxies ( forbes et al .",
    "1996 ) , indicating that the spatial distribution of the globular clusters is more extended than the optical light .",
    "for example , the specific frequency of globular clusters in ngc  3115 decreases from @xmath136 to @xmath137 in moving from the outer to the inner regions of the galaxy ( kundu & whitmore 1998 ) . therefore , globular cluster x - ray sources might be relatively rare in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies ( or bulges ) , while comprising a larger percentage of the x - ray source population at larger radii ( 20% in the case of ngc  4697 ; sib01 ) .",
    "if this is the case , galaxies with high globular cluster specific frequencies would have higher @xmath9 values than galaxies with low globular cluster specific frequencies because of a higher number of globular cluster x - ray sources at large radii . at smaller radii ( such as within the bulge or one effective radius of a galaxy ) where non - globular cluster x - ray sources dominate ,",
    "the @xmath9 value might be a constant from galaxy to galaxy , allowing the distance indicator method to be utilized .",
    "a search for globular clusters in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies with _ hubble space telescope _ would be useful in definitively determining the significance of globular cluster x - ray sources to the total lmxb population and resolving this issue .",
    "the ability to separate the stellar emission from gaseous emission has only become possible since the launch of _",
    "chandra_. whereas in x - ray bright galaxies",
    "the contribution from lmxbs is minimal , such a separation becomes important as the gaseous component becomes less dominant .",
    "for example , the _ rosat _ pspc spectrum of ngc  1291 could be fit equally well with a two - component raymond - smith + bremsstrahlung model with @xmath138 kev , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( bregman et al .",
    "1995 ) as it could with just a raymond - smith model with @xmath141 kev and @xmath142 = 0.01 solar ( read , ponman , & strickland 1997 ) . in both cases , the inability of _ rosat _ to resolve out the binaries and especially the luminous , highly absorbed agn led to an erroneous measurement of the temperature of the diffuse hot gas .",
    "inaccuracies in the temperature and flux of the hot gas subsequently adversely affects the determination of quantities such as the @xmath143 relation and the @xmath144 relation , both of which have been used to characterize the history and evolution of the hot gas within early - type systems .",
    "given the spectral and spatial results above , we conclude that 33% ( 41% ) of the counts and 14% ( 27% ) of the 0.310 kev ( 0.32 kev ) luminosity emanates from a truly diffuse , gaseous component .",
    "the 0.310 kev x - ray luminosity of the gas is @xmath109 ergs s@xmath6 , leading to a gaseous @xmath9 value of @xmath145 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath119 .",
    "such a value is quite low compared to x - ray bright elliptical galaxies , but similar to the values found for x - ray faint ellipticals and the bulge of m31 ( sib01 ; shirey et al .",
    "2001 ) . given the velocity dispersion of the bulge of ngc  1291 of 162 km s@xmath6 ( dalle ore et al .",
    "1991 ) , the derived temperature of the gas of 0.32 kev falls very close to the best - fit @xmath144 relation of davis & white ( 1996 ) , but considerably above the best - fit relation of brown & bregman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the measured temperature is well above the temperature predicted from the velocity dispersion of 0.17 kev , if the thermal energy of the gas were equal to the kinetic energy of the random motions of the stars .    the beta - model for the surface brightness profile of the gas",
    "can be inverted to obtain the density profile , @xmath146^{-3\\beta/2}$ ] . using the best - fit values of the gaseous surface brightness profile of @xmath55 and @xmath147",
    ", we derive a central electron density of @xmath148 @xmath149 .",
    "this value is quite high when compared to values obtained for early - type systems with previous instruments ( e.g. , rangarajan et al .",
    "however , the @xmath11 spatial resolution of _ chandra _ coupled with the nearness of ngc  1291 allows us to probe the electron density profile on the scale of @xmath050 pc ( note that at the distance of the virgo cluster the core radius would be only @xmath150 , far below the resolution limit of previous x - ray telescopes ) .",
    "the implied mass of the gas ( assuming a volume filling factor of one ) within a radius of 120@xmath1 is @xmath151 m@xmath124 .",
    "this value is substantially smaller than the derived gas masses of big bright elliptical galaxies , which tend to be as high as @xmath152 m@xmath124 .",
    "the cooling time of the gas at the center of the galaxy is @xmath153 years , and remains less than a hubble time out to the extent to which the gaseous emission can be detected ( @xmath154 ) .    given the relative isolation of ngc  1291 , it would appear that the lack of a substantial amount of x - ray emitting gas in the bulge is not the result of recent interaction with a cluster or another galaxy .",
    "this result is in accordance with the findings of brown & bregman ( 2000 ) that optically less luminous galaxies in lower density environments are x - ray faint . in smaller galaxies ( or bulges ) in non - cluster environments , supernovae - driven winds can clear the system of much of the gas that might have been pressure - contained by intracluster gas had the galaxy resided in a cluster environment .",
    "finally , the metallicity of the hot gas in early - type systems has been a longstanding controversy .",
    "optical measurements of the metallicity of stars indicate abundances of solar or greater in elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies . yet , many measurements of the metallicity of the x - ray gas , particularly those determined with _ asca _ , have yielded values of the metallicity of @xmath155 for many galaxies .",
    "several explanations have been set forth to account for this discrepancy .",
    "buote ( 1999 ) suggests that the low measured metallicity of the x - ray gas with _",
    "asca _ is an artifact of fitting the spectra with isothermal models .",
    "multi - temperature models , either due to local multiphase gas or a temperature gradient , would result in higher abundances , at least in the case of the brightest x - ray elliptical galaxies .",
    "finoguenov & jones ( 2000 ) also point out that the angular scales of the optical and x - ray metallicity are different ; whereas integrated optical metallicities are typically measured within an arcminute or less for galaxies at the distance of virgo , x - ray measurements are typically average over @xmath0@xmath156 bins .",
    "given that the optically - determined metallicities often decline significantly with radius ( carollo , danziger , & buson 1993 ) , the stellar metallicity might actually be subsolar at large distances for the center of the galaxy . furthermore , the _ chandra_-determined abundance profile of the elliptical galaxy ngc  4374 peaked toward the center to a value of 0.6 solar within a 0.55 kpc annulus , and declined at larger radii ( finoguenov & jones 2001 ) . both the multi - component temperature argument and the mismatch of angular size argument",
    "seem to resolve the discrepancy between the metallicity measurements in the much - studied x - ray bright early - type galaxies .",
    "however , neither explain the low metallicity found here for ngc  1291 .",
    "the metallicity from the @xmath97 annulus is only @xmath101 solar .",
    "an optical measurement of the metallicity of the bulge found it to have an mg@xmath157 index of 0.24 magnitudes ( golev & prugniel 1998 ) corresponding to fe / h = 1.1 solar ( terlevich et al .  1981 ) .",
    "in addition , there appears to be no temperature gradient or evidence for cooling gas in the center of ngc  1291 to bias the metallicity determination of the gas .",
    "it appears that x - ray faint systems like ngc  1291 ( and ngc  4697 , although only a global metallicity was determined ; sib01 ) really do have low metallicity gas even at their centers .",
    "the presence of a bright , central x - ray point source is somewhat surprising considering there is little evidence in the literature that ngc  1291 hosts an agn .",
    "while not as luminous as other low luminosity agn , the spectral parameters of the central x - ray source are very similar to those found for a sample of low luminosity agns , liners , and starbursts observed by _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ by ptak et al .",
    "such spectral parameters are also common among narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( reeves & turner 2000 ) . it should be noted that in these systems the x - ray luminosity of the agn is at least a factor of ten higher than the agn in ngc  1291 .",
    "what is even more surprising is that the flux of the soft component was unchanged between ob1 and ob2 , while the hard component decreased in intensity by a factor of two over the same time period .",
    "the excellent spatial resolution of _ chandra _ confirms that the origin of the soft component lies within @xmath158 pc from the central source , and is almost assuredly associated with the central source .",
    "this kind of temporal behavior in the soft and hard components has also been seen in the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 766 with _ xmm - newton _ by page et al .",
    "these authors find that the soft x - ray excess , as well as the ultraviolet emission observed with _ xmm - newton s _ optical monitor varied very little throughout the observation , whereas the hard continuum component varied significantly .",
    "it is unlikely that the soft component can be reprocessed hard power law emission , since in this case the fluxes of the hard and soft components should vary together .",
    "it is possible that the soft emission emanates directly from the hot inner accretion disk ( malkan & sargent 1982 ) and is the high energy tail of the ultraviolet bump seen in these objects .",
    "alternatively , the source of the soft x - ray emission may be the compton up - scattering of the ultraviolet photons from this disk .",
    "the detection of a low luminosity active nucleus in ngc  1291 also explains the detection of unresolved 60 micron and 100 micron emission in this galaxy ( rice et al .",
    "bregman et al .  (",
    "1995 ) point out that it was surprising that very little if any co emission was detected in this galaxy given the 100 micron flux of 10.7 jy , based on the observed correlation of co with 100 micron emission in other galaxies .",
    "it is quite possible that the 100 micron emission is associated with the agn and not with dust associated with star formation in the bulge .",
    "the ratio of hot to cold gas is a strong function of galaxy morphological type .",
    "the interstellar material in late - type spiral galaxies is predominantly atomic and molecular with trace amounts of hot gas , while in elliptical galaxies it is just the opposite , with s0 galaxies having a roughly equal mixture of the two ( e.g. , bregman , hogg , & roberts 1992 ) . as an sa galaxy",
    ", we would expect ngc  1291 to have more cold gas than hot gas .",
    "this is indeed the case here , where the mass of the hot gas is @xmath151 m@xmath124 , while the h  i gas mass is @xmath159 m@xmath124 ( van driel , rots , & van woerden 1988 ) .    the h  i distribution in ngc  1291 ,",
    "as is the case with several s0 and sa galaxies , is ring - like in nature ( van driel et al .",
    "the central hole in the h  i is 7 kpc in radius .",
    "an analysis of _ rosat _ pspc data by bregman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the x - ray emission appears to fill this hole .",
    "we confirm this result with our _ chandra _ observations ; hot , diffuse gas with a temperature of @xmath00.3 kev is detected out to a radius of 5 kpc .    whether the hot gas has actually displaced the cold gas or whether it is merely the case that cold gas is a disk phenomenon while hot gas is a bulge phenomenon is still an open question . as bregman",
    "et al .  (",
    "1995 ) point out , if the hot and cold gas are thermally coupled , convection and turbulent mixing can lead to the conversion of hot gas to cold gas and vice versa , causing the the two phases to be spatially anticorrelated , with the phase with the higher column density winning out .",
    "a signature of this would be a softening of the spectrum of the hot gas with increasing radius , as successively more hot gas is cooled by the presence of cold gas .",
    "indeed , there is a softening of the 0.71.0 kev/0.30.7 kev ratio with increasing radius ( figure  [ fig : ratio ] ) , although it should be noted that the softening occurs at a radius in which there is no detectable h  i emission .",
    "a more definitive answer might be obtained with an sa or s0 galaxy that does not have such a large hole in its h  i distribution .",
    "several galaxies in the h  i sample of van driel & van woerden ( 1991 ) show complex h  i morphology in the center of the galaxy . a high resolution _",
    "observation of the bulges of these galaxies might shed some light on the interaction ( or lack of interaction ) between the hot and cold phases of the interstellar medium .",
    "if the two phases were thermally isolated , the cold gas would absorb soft x - rays from the hot gas behind it , leading to a hardening of the x - rays in the direction of the h  i knots .",
    "alternatively , if the phases are thermally coupled , we might expect the the x - ray gas to fill the empty pockets in the h  i distribution , indicating that cold gas has been turned into the hot phase in these regions .",
    "analyses of two _ chandra _ observations of the bulge - dominated spiral ngc  1291 have revealed the primary x - ray  emitting components of the galaxy .",
    "the bulk of the x - rays ( by counts and by luminosity ) emanates from a collection for several dozen lmxbs that exhibit a range of spectral characteristics .",
    "a significantly smaller fraction of the x - ray emission comes from a 0.32 kev thermal gas with low metallicity .",
    "these observations demonstrate , along with _ xmm - newton _ observations of the bulge of m31 ( shirey et al .",
    "2001 ) , that the x - ray emission of bulges of galaxies resemble that of a sub - class of elliptical and s0 galaxies that are x - ray faint .",
    "the rather high temperatures measured for sa galaxies with _ einstein _",
    "( kim et al .",
    "1992 ) were the result of the mixture of two spectrally distinct components , namely lmxbs and hot gas .",
    "the luminosity distribution function of lmxbs in the bulge of ngc  1291 can be compared to that of other early - type galaxies to explore differences in the lmxb populations from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "there are no lmxbs with luminosities greater than @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 in ngc  1291 , where about seven were expected by scaling from ngc  4697 or ngc  1553 .",
    "this lack of high luminosity lmxbs is the cause of the wide spread in the stellar @xmath9 values seen with previous x - ray instruments .",
    "such a spread suggests that the production of lmxbs with massive primaries is not uniform from galaxy to galaxy , despite the uniformness of the present - day stellar population among early - type systems . on the other hand , below @xmath41 ergs s@xmath6",
    "there is remarkable agreement in the lmxb functions of ngc  1291 and ngc  4697 .",
    "this agreement is highly sensitive to the assumed distance of ngc  1291 .",
    "if this agreement is a generic property of lmxbs in early - type systems , it can be used as an accurate distance indicator , one of the very few non - optical methods for determining galactic distances .",
    "the distribution of the hot gas can be described by the standard @xmath51 profile with @xmath147 and @xmath160 .",
    "the central density of the gas is 0.28 @xmath149 , and the total mass of the gas is @xmath151 m@xmath124 , far less than the mass of the h  i in the galaxy .",
    "there is marginal evidence that the temperature and metallicity decrease slightly outside of 0.6 kpc .",
    "the temperature of the gas , while lower than in x - ray bright galaxies , is similar to that in other x - ray faint systems such as ngc  4697 and the bulge of m31 ( sib01 ; shirey et al .",
    "the paucity of gas in the system is probably the result of the removal of most of the gas by supernovae - driven winds rather than interaction with a cluster environment .",
    "the low measured metallicity of the gas is in conflict with the optically - determined value of the metallicity of the bulge .",
    "the hot gas fills the hole in the h  i distribution , possibly indicating that the hot gas has displaced the cold gas in the overlap region .",
    "however , future observations of sa galaxies with smaller h  i holes will be able to address this issue more conclusively .",
    "finally , the central point source is coincident with the optical center of the galaxy , and exhibits significantly different spectral characteristics than the sum of the other resolved point sources . above 1.5 kev",
    ", the spectrum is adequately described by a highly absorbed ( @xmath161 @xmath61 ) power law with @xmath162 , and the luminosity varied by a factor of two between the two observations . below 1.5 kev , there is an excess of soft photons over what is expected from hot gas within the extraction region .",
    "the soft component is of equal strength in the two observations , and can be modeled by a mekal model with a temperature of 0.75 kev and low metallicity , and has a luminosity that is 5%10% that of the hard component .",
