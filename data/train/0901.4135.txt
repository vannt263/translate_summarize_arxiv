    "in the context of the currently favored cosmological @xmath4-cold dark matter model ( @xmath4cdm ) of our universe , the formation and evolution of galaxies remains a major unsolved problem . in this model ,",
    "structures form in a bottom - up , hierarchical , manner by which smaller fragments merge together to form more massive systems .",
    "while this model has been very successful at reproducing observations on large scales , a number of issues remain to be resolved at the galaxy - scale regime ( moore et  al .  1999 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; primack 2007 , and references therein ) . in particular , the formation of disk galaxies is not well represented in current implementations of simulations based on @xmath4cdm ( e.g.  bell et  al .",
    "2003 ; kaufmann et  al.2007 ; dutton et  al .",
    "the discrepancies do not necessarily indicate a failure in the @xmath4cdm model , but rather point to physical regimes and processes that are either not well understood or difficult to implement in large simulations .",
    "given the theoretical difficulties and limitations faced by current models , a true understanding of disk galaxies must include information from an observational perspective .",
    "all aspects of baryonic physics , from hydrodynamical processes involving gas , through star formation and feedback from supernovae and agn , can play a role in the formation and regulation processes that shape galaxies , particularly where dynamically violent processes such as major mergers and rapid collapse are not dominant . for spiral galaxies ,",
    "the very presence of a disk component implies that no such major event has occurred since the formation of the dynamically fragile disk .",
    "additionally , most disk galaxies harbor central bulge components whose prominence in terms of total mass or light weight spans a wide range from truly bulgeless systems to the bulge - dominated early - type s0/sa s .",
    "a question that naturally arises is if the final step to the disk - less , i.e.  pure elliptical , galaxies is a natural extension of bulge - to - total ratios in systems along the hubble sequence .",
    "such an extension would imply that the dominant bulges of early - type spirals have followed a similar evolutionary path to those of pure elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , coming from the opposite end , a connection between the tiny bulges of late - type spirals , through early - types , to pure ellipticals may not seem as obvious , and allowance must still be made for the pure disk galaxies in any scenario .",
    "the emerging observational picture of bulge formation currently implies similar evolutionary paths for early - type spirals and pure ellipticals , while the later - type bulges exhibit much more diversity in their observed properties , consistent with having formed through a secular redistribution of material from the disk ( e.g.kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "the nomenclature predominant in the literature to distinguish between formation scenarios for bulges names those appearing very similar to pure elliptical systems ( i.e.  rapid and/or violent formation which includes both the monolithic collapse and major merging scenarios ) as `` classical bulges '' and those formed secularly from the disk as `` pseudobulges '' .",
    "however , uncertainties in making a clear - cut distinction between these cases still remain , particularly in regards to the stellar populations ( sps ) of spiral bulges .",
    "a very useful probe in discerning between formation scenarios is a detailed breakdown of the age , metallicity ( @xmath5 ) , and kinematic properties of the sps comprising bulges of all types .",
    "information about both light- and mass - weighted quantities is needed to form a comprehensive picture of the star formation history ( sfh ) of a given system . however , beyond our local group , we are limited to observations of the integrated light along a given line of sight . of relevance",
    "is whether the integrated light at any location in a galaxy can be deconvolved into the relative fractions of stars of a given population that contribute to the total light .",
    "this question is especially acute for spiral galaxies that are known to harbor a mixture of young and old stars and can suffer from the extinction effects of dust .",
    "observations of colour gradients and absorption line - indices in galaxies can both be interpreted as a single - burst , single-@xmath5 stellar population ( ssp ) , from which light - weighted ssp - equivalent ages and metallicities can be drawn with the help of spectral synthesis models ( e.g.  vazdekis 1999 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 , hereafter bc03 ; thomas , maraston , & bender 2003 ; le borgne et  al .",
    "2004 ; maraston 2005 ; schiavon 2007 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  trager , faber , & dressler 2008 ) and globular clusters ( e.g.  cohen , blakeslee & rhyzhov 1998 ; puzia et  al .",
    "2005 ; hernandez & valls - gabaud 2008 ) , are often assumed to result from the evolution of a single burst of star formation and thus can be represented by a ssp of a given age and @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption , however , breaks down for spiral galaxies that are believed to have been converting gas into stars at a relatively constant rate over most of their lifetime ( e.g.  kennicutt 1983 ; james , prescott , & baldry 2008 ) . since the presence of a young sp will dominate the optical light even when its contribution to the mass is minimal , the light - weighted ages will not be representative of the entire population .",
    "even pure ellipticals show signs of `` frostings '' of young sps and may not be well represented by a single ssp ( serra & trager 2007 ) .",
    "greater potential for disentangling the sfh of spiral galaxies exists if they can be assumed to have proceeded smoothly with time .",
    "this approach was followed by macarthur et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) using broad - band optical colours for 172 low - inclination disk galaxies . to the extent that the nearby spiral galaxies in this sample share a similar underlying sfh and that no burst involving more than @xmath610% of the galaxy mass has occurred within the past 12gyr , the method provides reliable relative results . among others",
    ", it was found that the sfh of spiral galaxies depends strongly on the galaxy potential and halo spin parameter .",
    "conclusions based on colour gradients are , however , plagued by a degeneracy between the effects of age , @xmath5 , and dust , all leading to redder colours .",
    "spectroscopic techniques , such as those based on absorption - line equivalent widths that are largely impervious to dust effects ( macarthur 2005 ) , or fitting of the full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which can incorporate a dust component , offer a more detailed and discriminating view , especially in light of the latest implementations of sp synthesis models ( e.g.  vazdekis 1999 ; bc03 ; le borgne et  al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "early - type spirals with their large bulge - to - disk ratio offer a significant observational advantage over late - types since their bulges , which rise significantly above and below the disk , can be studied spectroscopically in the edge - on perspective free from disk contamination and extinction from dust .",
    "late - type bulges , on the other hand , are small and often no thicker than the galaxy disk itself , thus requiring a face - on projection for their study .",
    "while dust and contamination from the inner disk will still thwart any pristine observation of the bulge , the face - on orientation minimizes line - of - sight integrations and keeps the light distribution of the bulge and disk free of inclination effects .",
    "spectroscopic studies of bulges spanning the full range of hubble types are few , and the results are often conflicting .",
    "the absorption - line studies of the central regions of sa  sc spirals of trager et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and proctor & sansom ( 2002 , hereafter ps02 ) both find that late - type bulges can not be reproduced using primordial collapse models and invoke extended gas infall onto the central bulge to explain the observations . in a similar study , goudfrooij et  al.(1999 ) conclude the opposite , their findings being more compatible with predictions of the ` dissipative collapse ' model than with those of the ` secular evolution ' model for bulge formation .",
    "their sample is , however , dominated by early - type spirals and these conclusions may not apply to the full range of spiral types .",
    "finally , the analysis of moorthy & holtzman ( 2006 ) of line strengths in the bulges and inner disks of 38 spirals also favours a scenario whereby merging is the dominant mechanism for bulge formation .",
    "thomas & davies ( 2006 ) reanalyzed the ps02 data and found no difference between the sps of spiral bulges and es at a given central velocity dispersion , @xmath7 , concluding that processes involving disk material can not be responsible for the recent star formation implied by the young ages . in an analysis of stellar absorption line gradients in the bulges of 32 nearby edge - on spirals ( s0sc ) , jablonka et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) also find that , when compared at a at a given velocity dispersion , galaxy bulges resemble elliptical galaxies .",
    "recently , macarthur et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) have extended these results to bulges at intermediate redshifts ( 0.1@xmath8@xmath9@xmath81 ) finding that the mass assembly history of bulges , inferred via the fundamental plane , is indistinguishable from that of pure spheroidal galaxies ( e / s0s ) at a given mass . a significant outlier from this trend , however , is the bulge of our own milky way ( mw ) .",
    "detailed photometric ( zoccali et  al .  2003 ) and spectroscopic ( rich & origlia 2005 ; zoccali et  al .",
    "2006 ) studies of abundance ratios of individual mw bulge stars reveal old and @xmath1-enhanced sps that must have formed long ago and on short timescales , and no evidence is found for the presence of a younger sp .",
    "this observation is difficult to reconcile with the mw s small @xmath7 and the presence of a stellar bar ( e.g.lpez-corredoira et  al .",
    "2007 ) . as thomas & davies point out ,",
    "the mw studies sample a larger physical radius than those of external galaxies so this conundrum could be resolved if there is a positive age gradient in the bulge .",
    "adding further complexity to the picture , in a study of absorption - line maps of 24 early - type spirals , peletier et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that while inclined samples , which sample the disk - free outer bulge regions , reveal uniformly old sps , randomly oriented samples , spanning the same range in hubble type , show a wide range in sp parameters .",
    "this discrepancy , along with their observation of central dips in the velocity dispersion profiles of half of their bulges , indicative of the presence of a colder central component , can be reconciled in a picture whereby the centers of most early - type spirals contain multiple kinematic components : an old and slowly rotating elliptical - like component , and one or more disk - like , rotationally supported , components which are typically young , but can be old .",
    "the sum of all central components make up the photometrically defined bulge , and the different components contribute differently to the integrated light depending on the viewing angle .",
    "their conclusion of a rejuvenation of the central region through dynamical disk - like processes , however , is difficult to understand in the context of the above results in that the `` rejuvenated '' low-@xmath10 ellipticals do not have disk components .    at the heart of these conflicts",
    "is the fact that extant studies of local bulges are limited in one way or another ( sample size , range in hubble type , data of insufficient depth and/or spatial resolution for studies of gradients and assessment of disk contamination , etc . ) .",
    "our aim is to remedy this situation with a systematic and homogeneous study of the sps and kinematics of bulges for the full range of hubble types . a first , and important , step is to establish a reliable procedure for extracting a proper representation of the sp content that does not suffer from the degeneracies and limitations discussed above .",
    "in this paper , we present a pilot sample of long - slit optical spectroscopy of eight nearby , low - inclination , spiral galaxies observed with gemini / gmos with which we develop such a technique and attempt to address the formation of spiral bulges through a study of their radial profiles in sps and kinematics .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : data ] we detail the sample selection , observational strategy , and reduction procedures .  [ sec : sps ] outlines our technique for extracting sp parameters from integrated spectra including details of the fitting algorithm , providing specifics about the weighting of individual pixels and our so - called `` @xmath10-clipping '' procedure for masking deviant pixels , as well as a description of the model sp templates used in the fits .",
    "our results are presented in  [ sec : results ] which includes the derived sp parameters and their radial profiles , kinematic profiles ( rotation velocity and velocity dispersion ) , an investigation of correlations of central parameters , and a comparison with previous studies .",

    "( 10 ) : overall impression .",
    "using radially resolved long - slit spectra of eight star - forming spiral galaxies , we have performed a detailed analysis of their stellar population and kinematic profiles and provide interpretations based on currently favored formation scenarios .",
    "central correlations in ages and metallicities with velocity dispersion are compared to other studies of bulges and pure elliptical galaxies .",
    "the most pertinent observations are as follows : + * fitting techniques : *    * with moderate spectral resolution , good @xmath14 coverage , and high s / n /   ( @xmath1550 ) , measurement of light - weighted average ages & metallicities for star - forming galaxies is feasible .",
    "* details are critical : calibration ( @xmath14 & relative flux ) , resolution , velocity dispersion , and rotation must be treated self - consistently between the data and models . * different fitting techniques weigh age , metallicity , and abundance ratios differently : balmer emission limits age fitting from indices ;",
    "age information is recovered ( in the presence of emission ) from full spectrum and continuum sed fitting ( but compounds the caveats about dust extinction and fluxing that are less important for indices ) . * ssps are not a good match to late - type galaxies .",
    "the degeneracies between age , metallicity , dust , etc . , are extreme leading to unstable fits . *",
    "full population synthesis is the only method to provide reliable and consistent results , and is thus the method of choice for the establishment of light and/or mass - weighted average ages and metallicities of late - type galaxies .",
    "* stellar populations of bulges and inner disks : *    * in a mass - weighted context , all bulges are predominantly composed of old and metal rich sps ( @xmath1380% by mass ) . *",
    "some contribution to bulge growth by secular evolution is clearly evident in most late - type bulges , with sps of 0.0011gyr contributing as much as 70% to the optical light . the corresponding contribution to the bulge mass , however , is generally small ( @xmath620% by mass or less ) . * spiral bulges display a wide variety of age and metallicity gradients ( from negative to positive ) in the bulge region , allowing for a range in formation mechanisms .",
    "* the observation of positive age gradients within the effective radius of some late - type bulges helps reconcile the long - standing discrepancy of the secular - like kinematics and light profile shape ( including the presence of a bar ) with `` classical''-like old and @xmath1-element enhanced sps observed in the milky way bulge as being due to sp sampling at different physical locations in the bulges .",
    "* spiral disks show mildly decreasing to flat profiles in both age and metallicity , generally consistent with inside - out formation .",
    "* bulges follow the correlations of increasing light - weighted age and @xmath5 with central velocity dispersion as for elliptical galaxies and early - type bulges found in other studies , but when a sfh more complex and realistic than an ssp - equivalent is taken into account , the trend is shallower and its scatter is much reduced .",
    "the implication seems to be that bulge formation has been dominated by processes that are common to all spheroids , whether or not they currently reside in disks .",
    "monolithic collapse can not be ruled out in all cases , but merging must be invoked for most of our spiral bulges . the process of formation occurs on shorter timescales for spheroids with the highest central velocity dispersions , and the relative contribution to the stellar mass budget in bulges via secular processes or `` rejuvenated '' star formation is small , but generally increases in weight with decreasing @xmath7 .    ultimately , we desire a large enough sample to solidify the conclusions inferred in this analysis and to assess any trends with galaxy parameters , but already these results provide important clues for bulge formation scenarios and restrictions for future implementations of galaxy formation models .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : spec_rad ] we present the fully calibrated and velocity ( redshift + rotation ) subtracted spectra at a number of radii for each galaxy .",

    "n /   of 50 was selected as a compromise between accurate age and metallicity determinations , and sufficient radial extent for gradient measurements .",
    "the light - weighted radius and the spectrum s corresponding s / n /   are labeled at the right edge of each panel ( note that the @xmath17=0  bin is in reality closer to @xmath17=004 due to our binning of 02/pixel and assuming a gaussian light profile in the galaxy center ) .",
    "many of the lick indices ( see  [ sec : azindfits ] ) are marked as vertical shaded lines ",
    "dark gray delineates the central passband and light gray the pseudo - continua .",
    "a number of pertinent observations can be made from a visual examination of the spectra :    * improper subtraction of prominent sky emission lines ( falling in and around the nad and tio indices ) is evident at the largest radial bins for all galaxies .",
    "* there is a significant overall bluing of the sed with radius for most galaxies .",
    "the two notable exceptions are n7741 & i0239 .",
    "the former shows significant emission in , , & ( the latter two appearing as fill - in to the underlying absorption line ) , and at [ ] @xmath196583,6548 and [ ] @xmath145007  in the central spectrum , which could mask an underlying redder stellar sed .",
    "n7495 & n7610 also show significant central emission and bluer seds compared to those galaxies with less obvious central emission ( e.g.  n0628 & u2124 ) , but a significant ( further ) radial bluing is still evident . * for some galaxies with significant emission in the h@xmath1+[]region , an emission spike superimposed on an underlying absorption can be seen in the other balmer lines ( most noticeably in h@xmath20 , but a spike can be seen even in h@xmath21 & h@xmath22 in extreme cases , e.g.  n7495 & n7741 ) .",
    "given that the balmer lines are the most sensitive age indicators in the lick index system , it is likely that index - based age estimates of the underlying stellar population will be difficult to constrain in these galaxies .",
    "in the full - spectrum fits , these emission lines will need to be masked out as emission lines are not included in the bc03 models .",
    "+ the most likely source of the emission is due to normal , but intense , current star formation .",

    "2005 ) , but small contributions in our most severe cases , n7495 , n7610 , & especially n7741 , can not be entirely ruled out ( but these would be restricted to seyfert 2 or liner agn as the broad lines characteristic of seyfert 1 spectra are not seen ) . *",
    "clear radial variations in many balmer and metal - line absorption line strengths can be seen in many of our galaxies .",
    "the interpretation of these gradients in terms of age and metallicity require an implementation of one of the fitting techniques described below in  [ sec : azfits ] .",
    "several methods exist to assign an age and metallicity to an observed integrated galaxy spectrum .",
    "each technique has its own advantages and drawbacks depending on the application .",
    "one of the fundamental challenges any successful method must overcome is the inherent degeneracy in stellar populations between old age , high metallicity , and dust content , all leading to redder seds .",
    "further difficulties can come from non - stellar sources that are not included in the sp models , such as emission lines from  regions , and contributions from a central agn .",
    "below we consider 3 methods for deriving the sp parameters from our long - slit spectra of star - forming spiral galaxies : ( i ) the lick / ids - index system ; ( ii ) ssp fits to the entire spectrum ; and ( iii ) full synthesis fits to the entire spectrum .",
    "the latter two also include a prescription for dust extinction . in the following , after discussing the importance of understanding the resolution of both the data and models when making comparisons , we describe the first two methods individually and then compare their results with each other and with those obtained from the full population synthesis fits in  3 .      in order to compare the data to the models",
    ", potential resolution effects must be accounted for . in the case where the models have higher resolution than the data ,",
    "this can be accomplished by degrading the models to the resolution of the observations .",
    "alternatively , when measuring absorption - line pseudo - equivalent widths , the indices could be corrected for resolution effects using a calibration based on a systematic broadening of templates of similar spectral type as the data ( e.g.  ps02 ) .",
    "the bc03 models used for this analysis have a reported resolution fwhm@xmath23=3  that is constant with @xmath14 . however , as mentioned above in ",
    "[ sec : bc03ssps ] , due to an error in accounting for the relative velocities of the stars before combining them into ssps , the effective resolution is not only a bit higher , but is best characterized by a constant fwhm with @xmath14 term plus a velocity ( constant with @xmath24 ) term .",
    "the precise characterization will also be slightly different for each model ssp , depending on the relative velocity shifts and weights of the stars entering each ssp . on average",
    ", we find that the fwhm is closer to 4 , so it is still much smaller than the 10.8  resolution of our data , which is dominated by the slit width .",
    "thus , to account for resolution effects due to the slit , we convolve all ssp models with a boxcar of width 10.8 .",
    "another broadening effect , independent of the instrumental setup , that must be considered prior to any direct model / data comparison is the galaxy velocity dispersion , @xmath25 , along the line - of - sight .",
    "galaxy disks are dynamically cold systems , flattened and supported by rotation , and thus have small velocity dispersions ( of order 1020kms^-1km@xmath26s@xmath27 ) , whereas the spheroidal bulges of spiral galaxies can have significant support from random motions .",
    "proctor & sansom ( 2002 ) measured velocity dispersions for late - type spiral bulges in the range 50200kms^-1km@xmath26s@xmath27  for hubble types sa  sbc . because our galaxies are mostly of later type ( sbc  scd , with one sa bulge ) , we can expect bulge velocity dispersions closer to the small end of this range .",
    "we have measured the velocity dispersion at each radial bin ( see  [ sec : kinem ] ) for our sample and , in principle , a unique set of models could be created for direct comparison for each radial bin of each galaxy .",
    "however , given that we are analyzing thousands of individual spectra , constructing a model for each one becomes too onerous .",
    "as an alternative solution , we have opted to degrade the resolution of all galaxy spectra to that with the highest dispersion , so one set of models , properly convolved to this same velocity , can be used for direct comparison with the data . we thus account for resolution by putting both the data and models on the same scale by convolving all observed spectra to @xmath10=168kms^-1km@xmath26s@xmath27 , and all models with a boxcar of width 10.8  ( corresponding to the slit width ) and to @xmath10=168kms^-1km@xmath26s@xmath27 .      the lick",
    "/ ids system of spectral line indices was designed to calibrate the strength of fundamental spectral features in stars and composite systems ( e.g. , gorgas et  al .",
    "the indices measure the strength of a particular spectral feature ( either atomic and defined as an equivalent width in  , or molecular and measured in magnitudes ) relative to a pseudo - continuum on each side of the feature .",
    "the most reliable indices have been calibrated as a function of stellar colour ( effective temperature ) , surface gravity , and metallicity ( gorgas et  al .  1993 ; worthey et  al .",
    "1994 ) allowing for the construction of semi - empirical population models ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) .",
    "each lick index is sensitive to the metallicity and age of stellar populations to varying degrees . when compared with population models , diagnostic plots of age versus metallicity - sensitive indices , such as versus mg_b _ or fe , help break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "however , measurements of many of the lick indices are quite sensitive to spectral resolution and , thus , to the velocity dispersion of the system ( gonz ' alez 1993 ; trager et  al .  1998 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ) , and their use requires relatively high signal - to - noise data ( s / n /   @xmath1550 ; see cardiel et  al .",
    "as mentioned above , we account for the former by convolving all data and model spectra to the same resolution before measuring the indices , and the latter by coadding the radial spectral bins to s / n / @xmath1550 .",
    "in addition , certain indices ,  in particular , can suffer from nebular emission contamination , even in early - type galaxies ( gonz ' alez 1993 ; de  zeeuw et  al .",
    "2002 ; caldwell et  al.2003 ) .    to help overcome the problem of nebular emission fill - in of the  feature , worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 , hereafter wo97 ) introduced two pairs of indices that measure the higher order balmer lines  and .",
    "while their age - sensitivity is not as strong as for , the higher order balmer lines are much less affected by emission from ionized gases ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ; osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "thus , when combined with a metallicity - sensitive index , the wo97 indices provide a more reliable age estimate for star - forming galaxies .    finally , another more subtle issue is the sensitivity of many of the indices to non - solar(neighborhood ) abundance ratios ( e.g.  tmb03 ) .",
    "the bc03 models used here do not account for variations in [ @xmath1/fe ] which are expected for sfhs with different timescales .",
    "higher [ @xmath1/fe ] is associated with very short sf timescales as there is not enough time for the fe produced in type ia supernovae to enrich the star forming gas that is heavy with @xmath1 elements produced in the short - lived massive stars that end their lives as type ii supernovae . on the other hand , for",
    "more extended sf , there is plenty of time for fe to enrich the gas to solar levels of [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "we attempt to address all of these issues in the context of our spiral galaxy spectra in the following .    in all , there are currently 25 lick / ids indices defined and calibrated .",
    "our spectra cover 24 of the indices ( missing only the bluest high - order balmer  index ) .",
    "we measure all 24 and use various combinations thereof in an attempt to assign reliable light - weighted age and metallicities to each spectrum .",
    "the obvious advantage of using the lick / ids - index system is that the narrow wavelength span of each index measurement renders them less sensitive to low - frequency effects such as overall flux calibration errors and dust reddening ( see macarthur 2005 ) .",
    "one major drawback when considering galaxies with current or recent sf is that the system was inherently designed to study the old stellar populations associated with elliptical galaxies and globular clusters .",
    "the age and metallicity fits based on lick indices use same maximum likelihood approach as in macarthur ( 2005 ) , but here the method has been extended to include more than just two indices .",
    "so , in the figure of merit ( eq .  [ a5 ] in macarthur 2005 ) , @xmath28 is now an arbitrary number of indices ( at least 2 and up to the 24 we measure here ) .    while the errors on the measured indices are independent , the model tracks are not orthogonal .",
    "this produces non - orthogonal errors in age and metallicity , which can lead to spurious correlations if not understood .",
    "additionally , the degree of non - orthogonality of the age and metallicity tracks changes with position on the grid .",
    "for this reason we have used monte carlo methods to model the `` effective ranges '' of the fitted ages and metallicities , taking into account a normal distribution about the measured errors ( see macarthur et  al.2004 for a more detailed description of this approach ) .",
    "we have seen in  [ sec : spectra ] that many of our galaxies have significant amounts of emission , most likely coming from star forming  regions .",
    "many authors attempt to correct for emission by fitting emission - free templates to their galaxy spectra .",
    "the templates can either be from linear combinations of stellar templates ( e.g.  gonz ' alez 1993 ) , or from models ( such as the bc03 models used here ) .",
    "neither method is ideal .",
    "the former requires a library of stellar templates , ideally taken in the same observing run with identical conditions , that match the galaxian spectra extremely well .",
    "the latter imposes a model dependence since , if a model with a given age is used to make the correction , the same model age will be returned ( you get out what you put in ) .",
    "additionally , a significant amount of dust in the galaxy would cause a reddening of the spectrum that must be included as another model - dependent free parameter in the template fits ( for both the empirical and model methods ) .    in a study of 40 elliptical galaxies , gonz ' alez ( 1993 ) created individual templates from stellar spectra obtained with the same observational set - up for each galaxy spectrum ( at each radius ) for the purpose of measuring accurate velocity dispersions .",
    "these templates fit the observed spectra to within 1% .",
    "division of the galaxy spectrum by the best fit template enabled detection of faint levels of emission ( seen predominantly in [ ]  and h@xmath20 ) in over 60% of his sample . from the galaxy / template spectrum , he computed pseudo - ews for the [ ] @xmath145007 & 4959   and h@xmath20 emission and found them to be strongly correlated as ew(h@xmath20)=0.7ew ( [ ] ) .",
    "as such , the h@xmath20 index in absorption could be corrected for emission line fill - in by adding the correction 0.7ew ( [ ] ) to the measured index .",
    "he also made a correction to the fe5015 index as the [ ] @xmath145007 line lies within the limits of the central bandpass .",
    "gonz ' alez ( 1993 ) strongly emphasized the importance of having suitable templates for reliable measurements of both velocity dispersion and emission corrections .",
    "the tight correlation between [ ]  and h@xmath20 emission was tested for later - type bulges ( s0sb bulges ) by ps02 using a method similar to that of gonz ' alez ( 1993 ) .",
    "while they found the same [ ] h@xmath20 relation for their earliest - type bulges , the six late - type bulges did not follow the gonz ' alez ( 1993 ) correlation for ellipticals , with some bulges showing a stronger h@xmath20/[]ratio , while others showed clear [ ]  emission , but none in h@xmath20 .",
    "this is likely due in part to the stronger absorption in the younger stellar populations , but could also be due to template mismatch , or true physical differences in the emission line regions for these galaxies .",
    "thus , no straight - forward correction seems to apply to spiral bulges and , by extension , their disks as well .",
    "the higher - order balmer lines are much less affected by emission line fill - in . for a broad range of physical conditions expected in galactic emission - line regions ,",
    "the line - strength ratios of h@xmath22 & h@xmath21 relative to h@xmath20 are 0.25 and 0.5 , respectively ( osterbrock 1989 ) , providing some relief from emission line fill - in . indeed , in many of our galaxies , the h@xmath20 index lies far off of the model grids ( from which ages @xmath2920gyr would be inferred ) , whereas the higher - order indices imply much younger ages ( @xmath65gyr ) .",
    "however , it is still possible that the higher - order balmer lines may suffer significant fill - in in strongly star forming regions ( and indeed we see this in a few of our spectra ; see , e.g.the central spectrum of n7495 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_rad ] ) .    given the above mentioned issues about emission - line corrections to the measured balmer - line indices ,",
    "we have instead opted for scheme whereby the emission line affected indices are systematically eliminated from the fit , and the age determinations are compared .",
    "we prefer this method as it is less model - dependent and takes full advantage of the narrow baselines of the indices , while still using information from the entire observed sed .",
    "we also attempt to address the issue of abundance ratio variations . while predictions for the effects of enhanced [ @xmath1/fe ] exist for lick indices ( e.g.  trager et  al .",
    "2000 ; tmb03 ; thomas , maraston , & korn 2004 ; schiavon 2007 ) , these do not yet provide high - resolution ssp spectra , thus we can not properly account for resolution by matching the models to the data , nor can we do full spectrum fits for comparison . to date , the only models that provide high - resolution spectra for stars with non - solar abundance ratios are those of coelho et  al .",
    "comparing the results obtained here with these new models will be the focus of an upcoming paper , but for now , we consider only the bc03 solar - scaled models for all fits .",
    "our fitting scheme for deriving light - weighted ssp ages and metallicities from lick indices considers 5 different cases as follows : 0.2 in * case a : fit all well - measured indices *    by `` well - measured '' we mean that the index ( all 3 bands ) is not severely affected by systematic problems such as the wavelength gaps between the 3 gmos ccds or strong sky lines ( which are extremely difficult to subtract accurately ) .",
    "the indices that were systematically eliminated from all fits are highlighted in gray in the leftmost column in the deviation plots ( left panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : azindfits][fig : azindfits8 ] , see below for plot description ) .",
    "note that we never include the nad index in any of the fits as this index is affected by sky lines as well as poorly understood absorption from the interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "the tio indices were also excluded from all fits except for n0628 due to sky line subtraction issues .    0.2 in * case b : case a @xmath30 ( all balmer - line indices , fe5015 , & cn@xmath31 ) *    here we attempt to measure ages and metallicities by eliminating all indices severely affected by emission .",
    "this is feasible because of the significant age dependence of g4300 and the weak age dependence of the metal - line indices .",
    "it is clear that all balmer - lines could suffer from emission line fill - in .",
    "the fe5015 index has the [ ] @xmath145007 line in its central bandpass thus could also suffer fill - in .",
    "while seldom mentioned in the literature , we note that the cn@xmath31 index could also be compromised by a strong source of emission since it contains the  line in its blue continuum ( which forces the index to larger values ) .",
    "this is clearly the case for at least two of our galaxies , n7495 & n7741 , where  is seen in emission ( see their respective spectra in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_rad ] ) . as an example of",
    "the strong influence that emission can have on cn@xmath31 , including cn@xmath31 in the fits , having removed all balmer - line indices and fe5015 , the age is forced to the maximum model age of 20gyr to accommodate the large cn@xmath31 . when cn@xmath31 is removed , the best - fit age drops to 12gyr .",
    "we also remark that , because of our resolution , if there is a strong emission spike in , its tails can bleed into the red passband of the g4300 index , but g4300 was not eliminated from the fits .    0.2 in * case c : case a @xmath30 ( h@xmath20 & fe5015 ) *    eliminate only the indices most severely affected by emission",
    ". this case should be appropriate for galaxies with only small amounts of emission , which could be undetectable in the spectra , because the higher - order balmer - lines will be only weakly affected .",
    "if the age estimates here are younger than those in case a , emission is likely present , whether or not it is clear from the spectra .",
    "0.2 in * case d : fit only h@xmath32 h@xmath33 , [ mgfe]@xmath34 , & g4300 *    these indices are the least affected by abundance ratios ( tmb03 ; thomas , maraston , & korn 2004 ) . while only a few of our galaxies showed evidence for significant [ @xmath1/fe ] enhancement ( n0173 , u2124 , & n7490 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : avgfemgb ] ) , many showed cn@xmath35 values far beyond of the model grids ( n0628 , n7490 , i0239 ) , which this combination of indices also avoids .",
    "such cn enhancements have been observed in globular clusters and elliptical galaxies ( henry & worthey 1999 ) , and are likely due to an enhancement in nitrogen ( rather than carbon ) .",
    "however , the interpretation of carbon - enhancement is challenging due to the many , and poorly understood , production sites for carbon .    0.2 in * case z : @xmath10 clipping of high deviators *    here",
    "we initiate the fit using all `` well - measured '' indices .",
    "we then follow an iterative procedure removing at each step indices that have large data@xmath30fit deviations : @xmath36=@xmath37 is the relative data / model fit deviation for index @xmath38 in units of the error on the measured index , @xmath39 .",
    "the threshold @xmath40 is set to 3.5 initially , and reduced by 0.5 with each iteration until a minimum value of 1 .",
    "thus , all indices with @xmath41@xmath151 get eliminated from the fit , and @xmath422 indices must remain for a successful fit .    0.2 in results from the age and @xmath5 fits for all five cases are displayed in figs .",

    ", we can look at radial trends and identify the bins that seem most deviant , but if we should consider only one bin per galaxy , we would not be able to make such judgments .",
    "thus , let us now consider sp fits to the full spectrum in hopes of finding a more stable method for the measurement of age and metallicity in star forming galaxies .",
    "we now examine full - spectrum fits , considering here just the best - fit single model ssp .",
    "again we use the bc03 models with all model and galaxy spectra convolved to the same effective resolution . while fitting the full spectrum makes use of all the information in the spectrum ,",
    "there are some drawbacks as well .",
    "most notably , the wider wavelength - baseline reinforces sensitivity to dust extinction and relative fluxing errors .",
    "however , in this case we can attempt to model the dust content by incorporating a prescription for dust in the models .",
    "the fits performed here to single ssp templates are done in a very similar manner to the full spectrum fits described in  3 , and we refer the reader to that section for full details of the dust models and the code . here , the number of templates in each fit is @xmath50=1 , and the best fit is determined by searching the @xmath49-space of the fits to each of the 70 individual ssp templates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : templates ] . additionally , for each ssp template , we first compute the @xmath49  of the best - fit dust - free model .",
    "we then consider the same ssp , but with increasing amounts of dust , as described in ",
    "[ sec : templates ] . at each dust level",
    "( increasing by increments of @xmath51@xmath52=0.5 at each step ) , if the @xmath49decreases from the previous fit , the dust content is increased and the ssp refit .",
    "this procedure is repeated until we reach a minimum in the @xmath49-space and only the lowest-@xmath49  ssp+dust combination for each template is kept for consideration in the final @xmath49  grid search .",
    "we imposed a maximum dust content of @xmath51@xmath52=8.5 , but this limit was never formally imposed , having always reached a minimum @xmath49  at a dust level lower than the limit .                in fig .",
    "[ fig : sspfits ] we show two examples of our ssp fits to the central spectra of u2124 ( left ) and n7495 ( right ) .",
    "the central spectrum of u2124 shows no evidence for emission when examined by - eye ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_rad ] ) , and the sed is generally well represented by a very old ( 20gyr ) but low - metallicity ( @xmath5=0.004 ) ssp with a small amount of dust reddening ( @xmath51@xmath52=0.5 ) .",
    "the spectrum of n7495 , on the other hand , shows significant emission , even in the higher - order balmer lines .",
    "while these do get masked out by our @xmath10-clipping procedure , this spectrum is clearly not well represented by a single ssp .",
    "the entire spectrum blueward of @xmath64700  is masked out in the fit , there being no ssp that can simultaneously match the low- and high - frequency characteristics of the spectrum .",
    "further insight into the single ssp fits is revealed by examination of the @xmath49  distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sspchis ] , we show the corresponding @xmath49  distributions to the fits shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sspfits ] . for u2124 ( left ) ,",
    "the lowest @xmath49  is at the 20gyr @xmath5=0.004 ssp ( indicated by the black cross ) .",
    "however , a clear minimum in the @xmath49  distribution has not actually been reached .",
    "since 20gyr is the maximum age of the ssp models , we can not say whether the @xmath49  would continue to decrease for even older ssp ages .",
    "it is also clear that the @xmath49  for the 2gyr @xmath5=0.05 ssp is not all that different from the absolute minimum .",
    "this is a clear example of the age / metallicity degeneracy in stellar populations whereby an old / metal - poor ssp is as good a fit as a young / metal - rich ssp .",
    "comparing the results to the full synthesis fits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) , we see that they provide much better overall matches to the seds .",
    "looking at the corresponding sfh for @xmath17=0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] ) , we see that there is about an equal contribution in terms of @xmath2-band light - weight from an old / metal - poor ssp , and old / metal - rich ssp , and a young / metal - rich ssp , indicating that this spectrum is not well - represented by a single ssp . on the other hand , the @xmath49  distribution for n7495 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sspchis ] , right ) reached a minimum within the ssp parameter space .",
    "however , the minimum is not well defined and a broad range of age/@xmath5/@xmath51combinations are essentially equally well fit . again , from the sfh plot ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sfh ] , right ) , we see that the central spectrum of n7495 has significant contributions from both very old and very young ssps , which can not be distinguished in a single ssp fit .",
    "of course , there are examples of single ssp fits where a clear and unambiguous minimum in the age/@xmath5/@xmath51  @xmath49-space exists , but these are the exception for our spectra of star - forming spiral galaxies .",
    "it is already quite clear that the only truly representative fitting technique to derive reliable relative sp ages and metallicities for the integrated optical spectra of star forming spiral galaxies is the full synthesis technique presented in ",
    "[ sec : synthesis ] .",
    "however , it is still useful to contrast the results from all 3 techniques to examine any clear relative trends , thus allowing the results from each method to be interpreted in the context of the other techniques . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsvssspvsind ] we compare the derived ages ( top panels ) and metallicities ( bottom panels ) between the single ssp vs. full synthesis ( fs ) fits ( left panels ) , the single ssp vs. case z ( ind `` z '' ) index fits ( middle panels ) , and the ind `` z '' vs. fs fits ( right panels ) .",
    "all quantities are light - weighted , and note that we label the fs parameters as average quantities .",
    "note also that the single ssp ages and metallicities are stochastically sampled in that they can only be exactly equal to one of the 70 ssp templates considered , whereas the fits bases on lick indices are interpolated between the model grid space , and the fs fits are weighted averages of all ssps contributing to the fit .",
    "there is a reasonable correlation between the ssp and fs ages ( upper left panel ) but the slope is far from unity ( dotted line ) .",
    "this is expected due to the difference between ssp - equivalent ages from those derived from the average of a linear combination of ssps .",
    "the difference and scatter become more severe the younger the age , and the ssp ages reach much younger light - weighted values than those of the fs fits .",
    "this is once again due to the fact that the youngest stars are bright and the single ssp fits are sensitive to the stars contributing most dominantly in flux to the integrated spectrum , whereas the fs fits are sensitive to any significant contribution from an underlying old population . on the other hand",
    ", there is no correlation between the ssp vs. ind `` z '' fits ( top middle panel ) . while these two fits both provide ssp - equivalent age estimates , their primary source of age discrimination is quite different . in the full spectrum ssp",
    "fits , it comes largely from the overall shape of the sed . for the index",
    "fits it comes from the age discriminating power of the indices that do not get clipped from the fit , which may be different for each fit , and are entirely insensitive to the overall sed colour .",
    "finally , the ind `` z '' vs. fs comparison ( top right panel ) shows a weak correlation with large scatter .",
    "the spread in the age predictions is similar between these two methods , indicating that neither is overly sensitive to just the most recent episode of sf , but the slope of the correlation is not unity , with the fs fits tending to older ages .",
    "as expected , in all comparisons , the best match is found for the oldest ages , corresponding to those spectra for which there is no evidence of emission lines ( e.g.  u2124 and n7490 ) .",
    "the situation for metallicity is quite similar , with a weak and less than unity correlation between the ssp and fs fits ( bottom left ) , essentially no correlation for the ssp and ind `` z '' fits ( bottom middle ) , and a stronger non - linear relation for the ind `` z '' and fs fits ( bottom right ) , with the fs fits tending to higher metallicities .",
    "given the weak to null correlations between the derived sp parameters between the three methods , it is also important to investigate how the derived gradients would be affected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gradsfsvssspvsind ] we show the radial variations in age and @xmath5 for the three different fits .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines are for the ind `` z '' fits and have erratic profiles that can jump drastically from one radial bin to the next .",
    "these jumps often land at the sp model extremes , indicating that they are poorly determined .",
    "the metallicity profiles seem to be much more stable that the age profiles , and as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsvssspvsind ] , they are biased to much lower values than the fs fits ( solid lines ) .",
    "the ssp profiles ( dashed lines ) , on the other hand , are much more stable from one radial bin to the next . for the relatively emission - line free u2124 ( left )",
    ", the age profile has a similar overall form to that of the fs fits , but because they are insensitive to sps providing small relative contributions to the sed flux , the ssp bulge looks much older than is indicated by the average age from the fs fits .",
    "moreover , the metallicity profile is constant at a sub - solar @xmath5=0.004 , whereas both other fits indicate radial variation in @xmath5 , with higher metallicity towards the center .",
    "this is another manifestation of the age/@xmath5 degeneracy , particularly in the context of seds that are made up of sps of a range of ages and @xmath5 s and are thus poorly represented by a single ssp .",
    "the emission - line dominated n7495 ( right ) shows a slightly different set of pathologies .",
    "the ind `` z '' age profile is again erratic , jumping from very old to very young values at consecutive radial bins .",
    "the single ssp fit profile is flat , but saturated at the lowest ssp age , being only sensitive to the significant amount of current sf and blind to any underlying population .",
    "the ind `` z '' metallicity profile again shows a similar trend as the fs fits , but at systematically lower-@xmath5 .",
    "the single ssp fit profile here is erratic , jumping between high and low-@xmath5 extremes .",
    "finally , the radial profiles in the amount of dust extinction inferred form the fs and ssp methods is shown in the bottom panels .",
    "both are in agreement for u2124 which is consistent with very little or no dust at all radii .",
    "the profile shapes for n7495 are similar , but the ssp derived dust levels are much higher .",
    "the higher values of @xmath51  in the single ssp fits could in part be absorbing the redness of the underlying old sp that the single young ssp does not accommodate .    to summarize",
    ", there is no clear correlation between the three fitting techniques for any spectrum with significant contributions to the light from multiple ssps .",
    "the ssp - equivalent parameters derived from either the index - based or single ssp fits reveal erratic behaviors in the radial profiles , which are very sensitive to different sets of characteristics of the spectrum . only the individual fits and radial profiles from the full spectrum population synthesis fits yield representative and stable results and are suitable for assessing relative trends in age and metallicity .",
    "therefore , the analysis and results presented in the main paper are based solely on the full spectrum synthesis fits ."
