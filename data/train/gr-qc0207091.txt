    "the idea that we live on a three - dimensional brane embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time have attracted a lot of interests for the past few years .",
    "this idea has a long history ( for references see  @xcite ) but its recent renewal caused primarily by the the works of l.randal and r.sundrum  @xcite .    in such brane - world scenarios",
    "the ordinary matter is confined to the brane while the graviton can propagate in a whole spacetime . the effective four - dimensional gravity on the brane is thus modified by extra terms  @xcite , which may play an important role in cosmology .",
    "one of the predictions of brane - world models is that the contribution from the energy - momentum tensor components in the equation of motion contains both linear and second order terms while in conventional cosmology they contribute only linearly .",
    "the other prediction is the presence of non - local terms that are the projection of a weyl tensor in the bulk onto the brane . in the case of frw metrics on a brane",
    "the bulk contributes the same way as a radiation .",
    "that is why this term is called `` dark radiation '' , despite its pure geometrical nature .",
    "dynamics of a brane universe filled with a perfect fluid have been intensively investigated during last three years ( see , for example , @xcite ) and some new regimes that are not inherent to the standard cosmology , such as stable oscillation @xcite , collaps of a flat universe @xcite , stage of growing anisotropy in bianchi i universe @xcite , unusual analog of an einstein static universe @xcite were found .",
    "a scalar field dynamics is complicated even in the standard cosmology @xcite , so , it is not surprizing that the case of scalar field on a brane gives us a variety of very interesting dynamical regimes .",
    "some features of a brane inflation have been studied in @xcite , the cosmological dynamics for exponential scalar field potentials have been described in @xcite .",
    "currently the problem of a scalar field dynamics on a brane continues to attract a great attention .    in the present paper",
    "we describe how several known regimes of the standard scalar field cosmology are modified in the brane scenario .",
    "we consider the effective four - dimensional frw cosmology on the brane with a scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath1 . in sec.2 modifications mostly arising from the square energy - momentum corrections to the einstein equations on a brane are described . in sec.3",
    "we describe some dynamical features arising from the presence of a negative `` dark radiation '' term .",
    "the effective four - dimensional equations of motion ( this form of equations can be easily derived from those in @xcite ) are @xmath2 where dot ( prime ) denotes differentiation with respect to time ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath3 , @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the fundamental 5-dimensional planck mass , @xmath6 is an effective 4-dimensional planck mass on a brane which depends on a brane tension @xmath7 as @xcite @xmath8    the brane tension @xmath7 is restricted to be positive in order to have a correct sign of gravitational force .",
    "the `` dark radiation '' constant @xmath9 has no restrictions on its sign .",
    "one of the distinctive features of equation ( [ constr ] ) is the presence of term quadratic in the field energy density .",
    "the contribution of this term should be negligible at low energies in order to reveal standard cosmology  @xcite , but at high energies this term becomes dominative .",
    "so let us investigate the set of equations ( [ constr])([ddotphi ] ) in the high - energy limit .",
    "we remind a reader that a scalar field dynamics is quite different in the stage of contracting and expanding of the universe . in the standard cosmology ( we use the common units @xmath10 in the standard case and keep all dimension parameters explicitly written in the nonstandard one ) for the contraction stage if the potential @xmath1 is less steeper than @xmath11 then we typically have the same regime as for @xmath12 with @xmath13 and a scalar field diverging as @xmath14 @xcite . for steeper potential",
    "it becomes dynamically important and the scalar field diverges in an oscillatory regime @xcite .",
    "the picture changes dramatically in the brane scenario . indeed , for @xmath12 substituting the ansatz @xmath15 into the equations of motion one",
    "may obtain the following solution : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the constants of integration .",
    "one can see that the principal feature of the model under consideration is that the scalar field tends to a constant value while in conventional cosmology it tends to infinity . although @xmath0 is finite , its time derivative tends to infinity providing `` stiff fluid '' equation of state @xmath19 as for a massless scalar field . from the other side ,",
    "as @xmath0 remians finite while @xmath20 diverges , then the kinetic energy of the scalar field always dominates the potential energy near a singularity at the contraction stage and the asymptotic ( 5 ) is valid for an arbitrary @xmath1 .    at the expansion stage",
    "a typical regime for a scalar field is inflation .",
    "let us now consider the problem of the steepness of the scalar field potential @xmath1 allowing the existence of inflationary stage in the evolution of a brane world .",
    "on an inflationary stage we can neglect contributions from the spatial curvature and the dark radiation terms in the equations of motion .",
    "the equations for two slow - roll parameters can be written in the following form ( see the high - energy limit of equations in @xcite ) @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes equality within the slow - roll approximation .",
    "the condition for inflation is @xmath24 . in the standard cosmology",
    "this condition is violated for potentials steeper than @xmath25 . in our case",
    "this condition can be violated only for potentials steeper than @xmath26 and for the critical case of @xmath27 the condition @xmath24 is violated for @xmath28 .",
    "so in the brane cosmology inflation requires less restrictions on the shapes of potential than in the conventional case , admitting potentials in the form of a `` potential wall '' .",
    "the nonstandard dependence on the components of the energy - momentum tensor of the matter alters also the conditions for a chaotic regime in this model . in conventional cosmology",
    "it has been shown that for a wide class of potentials @xmath1 the dynamics of a closed model ( @xmath29 ) is chaotic  @xcite . without loss of generality we can fix the initial value of @xmath30 to be zero .",
    "the initial value of @xmath31 can be determined from the equation ( [ constr ] ) and thus we have two - dimensional initial condition space .",
    "the numerical calculations show that starting from some initial conditions the phase trajectory can either fall into singularity or can pass through a local minimum of the scale factor , which is often referenced to as a `` bounce '' . in the latter case",
    "the scale factor will inevitably have a local maximum and thus we returns to the picture similar to the initial one with two possible outcomes .",
    "it has been shown that there is a set of infinitely bouncing solutions those initial condition measure is equal to zero .    on a @xmath32 plane the region where the scale factor can have extremum",
    "is determined from the constraint ( 1 ) by the inequality @xmath33    we remined a reader that in standard cosmology chaos may disappear for exponential and steeper than exponential potential of a scalar field . in ref .",
    "@xcite an analytical approach to this problem has been developped .",
    "it has been shown that using two facts established in numerical experiments , namely    ( a ) : :    all simple periodical trajectories have a point with    @xmath34 at the boundary , corresponding to equality sign in ( 8) , ( b ) : :    all trajectories which have in this reversal point a velocity vector    directing into the region ( 8) fall into a singularity and , then , can    not be periodical trajectories ,    it is possible to write a rather simple necessary condition for existence of chaos .",
    "these two facts may be violated in so called strong chaotic regime , however , this regime exists only for potential at least less steep than a quadratic one @xcite .",
    "so , we can use them for steep potentials when the chaotic regime begin to disappear .",
    "now we apply the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite to a brane case .",
    "first we assume that @xmath35 .",
    "a trajectory with @xmath36 and @xmath37 is directed outside of region ( 8) if @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the equation of the boundary . substituting @xmath40 and @xmath41 from eqs.(2)-(3 ) and using eq .",
    "( 1 ) we get this condition in the form @xmath42    if this condition is violated for all @xmath0 , chaos definitely disappears",
    ". as the power index of potential @xmath1 in ( 10 ) is bigger than the power index of the derivative @xmath43 , the inequality ( 10 ) is satisfied for exponential potentials if we take a suffitiently large @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it remaines true for potentials like @xmath44 . as a result",
    ", we can see that a chaotic dynamics on a brane can take place for steeper potential than in standard cosmology .",
    "potentials , violating ( 10 ) must have the form of potential wall .",
    "a critical case has the form @xmath45 it can be easily seen by integrating of ( 10 ) that for @xmath46 this condition is not satisfied for all @xmath0 .",
    "our numerical investigations indicates that chaos is absent in this case .",
    "the same analysis can be carried out for a nonzero @xmath9 though the corresponding equations become less simple in this case .",
    "a general property is that positive @xmath9 restricts condition for the chaotic behavior and negative @xmath9 makes it weaker . in the limit",
    "@xmath47 we can wright the simple analog of ( 10 ) @xmath48 which lead to a critical potential of the form ( 11 ) with @xmath49 .",
    "we can summarise these results in the following picture .",
    "it is known that in the standard scalar field cosmology there is a substantial differense between potentials less steep and steeper than the exponential one . for steep enough potentials",
    "the inflation become impossible , the chaotic regime for positive spatial curvature disappears and the behavior of a scalar field during a contraction of the universe becomes infinitely oscillating .",
    "for the latter modification we have no analog in the brane case - a scalar field do not diverges at the contraction stage independently on the potential .",
    "the first two modifications of the scalar field dynamics for steep potentials , however , have their analogs in the brane scenario . the boundary case which separates two different cases of the dynamics ( analogous to exponential potentials in the standard cosmology )",
    "is a `` potential wall '' of the form @xmath50 .",
    "now let us consider the effects originated from the presence of a `` dark radiation '' term .",
    "the important feature of the `` dark radiation '' term is that the the constant @xmath9 can be either positive or negative .",
    "due to the negative @xmath9 the evolution of the scale factor can be non - monotonic not only in the positive curvature case but also in flat and negative curvature case . indeed , as we can see from the system ( [ constr])([ddotphi ] )",
    "the @xmath9-contaning terms can mimic curvature terms .",
    "this leads , in particular , to existence of bounces in flat universe . moreover ,",
    "probability of a bounce increases with increasing of @xmath51 and can reach considerable values .    to illustrate this point",
    "we have performed numerical integration of system ( [ constr])([ddotphi ] ) in a pure nonstandard regime ( @xmath52 ) starting from some initial scale factor at the stage of contracting . in our numerical calculations we put @xmath53 .",
    "a particular trajectory is determined by two values - initial scalar field and its derivative . after fixing initial @xmath0 and @xmath31 the initial @xmath30",
    "can be found from the constraint equation ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "we have studied a compact area in the initial condition plane @xmath54 which is allowed by the constraint ( 1 ) and satisfying the inequality @xmath55 introducing the homogenious measure on this compact set of initial condition , we have the following results . for the first set of the bounce probabilities",
    "@xmath56 the mass of the scalar field is chosen to be @xmath57 .",
    "as for the flat universe @xmath9 and @xmath58 enter in the equation of motion only in the combination @xmath59 , our results are independent on a particular initial scale factor .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this regime of transition from contraction to expansion of the flat universe can exist only with some kind of negative energy terms in ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "brane cosmology gives us a simple example of such kind of energy sourses .",
    "our numerical studies show that the measure of initial condition leading to a bounce can be significant for large negative @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics of a brane universe in positive curvature case is more complicated .",
    "a positive @xmath9 leads to shrinking the regions of possible extrema of the scale factor and for large enough @xmath9 the chaos disappears completely .",
    "the dynamical picture is the same as in the standard case of a scalar field dynamics in the presence of a hydrodynamical matter with the equation of state @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "a negative @xmath9 ( in this case we have no direct analogy with a convensional cosmology ) acts in opposite direction : the region of possible extremum of the scale factor grows with the growth of the absolute value of @xmath9 and ( as we will see later ) the chaotic properties of the universe increase . in fig .",
    "[ boundaries ] the region where the scale factor can have extremum is bounded by two solid lines and the region where the scale factor can have minimum is bounded by dashed and solid lines . for this figure",
    "the scalar field potential is chosen to be @xmath61 where @xmath62 and the value of brane tension @xmath63 ( we return to the units @xmath10 ) .",
    "the black color corresponds to @xmath35 while the gray color corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "= 0.5    we describe below an interesting transformation of the chaotic dynamics that takes place in the standard regime ( @xmath65 ) . from now on let us assume the scalar field potential to be in a form @xmath61 .",
    "in the case @xmath35 the initial conditions that lead to bounce forms a set of a narrow regions separated by a wide regions where solution is singular .",
    "this picture undergoes substantial transformations with growing @xmath51 . in fig.2",
    "we fixed the initial value of @xmath0 to be zero and we choose @xmath62 , while allowing @xmath9 and @xmath58 to change in the interval from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and from @xmath68 to @xmath69 respectively .",
    "the initial conditions that leads to bounce after start from @xmath37 are colored in black while the white color corresponds to singular solutions .",
    "one can see that with the growth of the absolute value of @xmath9 the intervals of the initial scale factor that lead to bounce become wider , and for @xmath70 the first two intervals merge .",
    "solutions that start in the region of merging become extreemly chaotic .",
    "such solutions can oscillate for a long period without leaving a high - curvature region .",
    "with further decreasing of @xmath9 one can see successive interval merging and monotonic growth of the measure of initial conditions that lead to bounce .",
    "this picture is similar to one previously found in standard cosmological models with gently sloping potential  @xcite and in models that include second order curvature corrections  @xcite . in brane",
    "scenario this effect exists for a simple @xmath71 potential .",
    "it is interesting that for a pure nonstandard regime @xmath72 this strong chaos regime exists only for potentials significantly less steep than a quadratic one .",
