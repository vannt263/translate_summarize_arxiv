    "the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) in the universe has been supported by a lot of solid evidences observing from its gravitational interactions . on the other hand",
    "its particle property is still in a mystery . among all the candidates weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is the most popular one because of its natural mass and interaction ranges to give the right amount to account for the matter density observed today .",
    "experimental efforts to detect wimps are ongoing in direct and indirect searches as well as collider experiments .",
    "direct detection experiments are designed to observe the elastic scattering of wimps on the target nuclei through nuclear recoils . on the other hand , indirect detection experiments search for products of the wimp annihilation or decay processes such as gamma - rays , neutrinos , and",
    "charged cosmic rays . among those products , gamma - rays",
    "are often considered as the golden channel for the indirect detection of the dm because we can easily detect them and identify in which part of the universe they came from .",
    "it is intriguing that several independent collaborations have reported a broad excess of the gamma - ray ( at energies around few gev ) from the galactic center ( gc ) above the expected astrophysical emission through the analyses of the data accumulated by the fermi large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite , which is confirmed later by the experimental group @xcite .",
    "the excess might be explained by ( unidentified ) astrophysical sources such as millisecond pulsars  @xcite which can be an important part of unresolved point sources fitting the observed data @xcite .",
    "however the dm annihilation still remains as a most viable possibility to account for it @xcite .",
    "many collaborations have investigated such a possibility in a model independent way by classifying various scenarios of the dm on the basis of the final states of the annihilation process , and in turn quantitatively obtaining the scales of the mass and the annihilation cross section of the dm that can fit the gamma - ray excess . as a result",
    ", it has been shown that the dm annihilations into a pair of @xmath8 quarks  @xcite , leptons  @xcite , the higgs bosons  @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) , or new particles which subsequently decay to @xmath9 pairs  @xcite can give good fits to the data with proper choices of dm mass and the annihilation cross section .    the model independent studies typically consider the dm mass and the annihilation cross section as free parameters to fit the gamma - ray data for the given annihilation process .",
    "in this case , it is obvious that the impact on other experimental and cosmological constraints is subtle .",
    "hence , in the end , one has to consider a specific model that includes a plausible dm candidate and study various other theoretical and experimental bounds in connection with the gamma - ray excess .",
    "preceding model dependent analyses exist with the main annihilation channel for the gev scale excess ; @xmath8-quark pair  @xcite , lepton pair  @xcite , and new particles  @xcite .    in this paper , we examine if the dm interpretation for the gamma - ray excess can be realized in a model with a singlet fermionic dark matter ( sfdm ) which is originally proposed in  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "dm interacts with the sm sector only by the mixing between the sm higgs and a singlet scalar .",
    "particularly we specify the scenario where such a mixing is quite suppressed to avoid the recent bounds from the higgs measurements at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and various direct detection results of wimp , while keeping the relic density as observed .- channel scalar exchanges . ] actually this secluded sfdm scenario was previously suggested in  @xcite to provide a viable light wimp setup . here",
    "we slightly modify the secluded sfdm scenario by adding a pseudoscalar interaction in the dark sector to easily explain the fermi gamma - ray excess .",
    "interestingly , following the analysis in  @xcite , we could find the parameters giving good fits to the excess in several dm annihilation channels ; @xmath8 quark pair , higgs pair , and new scalar pair ( without fixing the decay mode of it by hand ) , depending on the mass hierarchies of particles and couplings .",
    "on top of these we further consider unavoidable constraints from the antiproton ratio by the pamela  @xcite and ams-02  @xcite , the gamma - ray emission from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the fermi - lat  @xcite , and the higgs measurements by the lhc  @xcite .",
    "these bounds are quite strong so the annihilation channel to @xmath8 quark pair remains viable only around the resonance region and after introducing a mixture of the scalar and pseudoscalar interaction in the dark sector .",
    "the surviving parameters in all the channels will be our benchmark points for future study on the collider signals .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the description for the sfdm model is given in sec .  [ sec : model ] .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ sec : gamma_excess ] , we calculate the photon energy spectrum from the sfdm annihilations , and in turn perform the fit to the gamma - ray data by considering other experimental and cosmological constraints . sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we introduce a real scalar field @xmath10 and a dirac fermion field @xmath11 , which transform as the singlet under the sm gauge group .",
    "in addition to the sm lagrangian , the dark sector lagrangian with the renormalizable interactions is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 the interactions of the singlet sector to the sm sector arise only through the higgs portal @xmath14 as given above .",
    "note that we extend the model proposed in @xcite by including the pseudoscalar interaction in the singlet sector .",
    "the inclusion of the pseudoscalar interaction is helpful for the analysis on the gamma - ray excess since it can conveniently fit the excess while satisfying the other constraints as explained in more detail in the next section .",
    "together with the sm higgs potential , @xmath15 the higgs boson acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and it can be written in the unitary gauge as @xmath16 with @xmath17  gev .",

    "one of interesting features of the sfdm model is that there is a mediator @xmath54 , which is an important new particle for realizing what is called the secluded wimp scenario in our setup  @xcite .",
    "various mediator particles have been introduced in several model independent studies to explain the fermi gamma - ray excess from the production of a pair of the light mediator particle with its subsequent cascade decay into sm fermions  @xcite . in the model independent study of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the dm annihilation into a pair of new particles ( @xmath246 ) with subsequent @xmath247 decay to @xmath98 , gives a good fit ( @xmath248 ) if @xmath249 gev , @xmath250 and @xmath251  @xmath136 for a self - conjugate dm . in this subsection",
    "we consider the corresponding channel in our model and find the best - fit parameters by varying the masses .",
    "the fraction of the dm annihilation rate for @xmath252 with @xmath253  gev and @xmath254 can easily become as large as 100% by taking suitable parameter values of the model .",
    "we also found that the best - fit spectrum is obtained if @xmath255 , as pointed out in the model independent study  @xcite .",
    "finding parameters for the good fits , we further consider the bound from the search of exotic higgs decays @xcite due to the decay mode @xmath256 .",
    "our choice of model parameters for the best fit is as follows : @xmath257  gev , @xmath258 , @xmath259  gev , @xmath260  gev , @xmath261 , and @xmath262  gev from @xmath219 , @xmath263  gev , @xmath264 , @xmath265  gev , @xmath266 , and @xmath267  gev . with these parameters",

    "the astrophysical bounds can be important like the previous scenarios .",
    "the analysis results on the gamma - ray search coming from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in @xcite show that the upper bound of the annihilation rate of @xmath276 is expected to be at least @xmath277 with @xmath278 gev for a non - self - conjugate dm .",

    "in this paper we considered a model with the sfdm , in which the mechanism of the thermal freeze - out is secluded from its observations in the direct detection and collider experiments .",
    "in addition to suppressing the mixing angle between the sm higgs boson and the singlet scalar we introduced a pseudoscalar interaction at the singlet sector to amplify the secludedness . in this type of model the dm search is generically difficult in the direct detection and collider experiments due to the secludedness .",
    "nonetheless , various indirect detection results can shed light on the parameter space to be probed . as an observational guide",
    ", we applied the model to the recent results on a few gev level gamma - ray excess at the gc revealed by the analyses on the fermi - lat data , which has been a hot issue in both theoretical and experimental sides to date .",
    "as a concrete analysis we adopted the results by ccw and applied the systematic uncertainties estimated by them",
    ". then we categorized the annihilation processes depending on the final states , @xmath128 , @xmath172 , @xmath172/@xmath215/@xmath284 , or @xmath216 , where the latter three channels are cascade processes producing multiple sm fermions or gauge bosons .",
    "the direction of our paper is not just explaining the gamma - ray excess but finding the model parameter values preferred by the observation and the constraints for the future study of the sfdm model . in this",
    "regard , other astrophysical constraints such as gamma - ray bounds from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( by fermi - lat ) and searches of antiproton excesses ( by pamela and ams-02 ) together with lhc bounds on the higgs boson are taken into account in our study . in order to satisfy these bounds",
    "we keep the value of the observed relic density of the dm while adopting the large uncertainties of the dm density profile near the gc to obtain the best - fit parameter point in each channel .",
    "our analysis found that the excess can be obtained with the similar level of @xmath84 values as those in various model independent searches , particularly for @xmath285 and @xmath216 channels with @xmath286 , @xmath287 , respectively considering the pure pseudoscalar interaction in the dark sector .",
    "however the former case is again strongly constrained from astrophysical and collider bounds commented above so a mixture of the singlet and pseudoscalar interaction in the dark sector is needed .",
    "although it is not easy to find the signals of the secluded sfdm model at the current level of the lhc , we may observe those in the future high luminosity lhc or next generation colliders .",
    "in particular various channels by trilinear higgs interactions can provide interesting signals .",
    "we will proceed the collider analyses for the parameter space found in this work , targeting their signatures at the lhc and future colliders  @xcite .",
