    "trapping atoms in low dimensions is of interest for several reasons @xcite .",
    "the phase transition to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , which is forbidden for a homogeneous bose gas in 1d and 2d geometries , becomes feasible if confining 1d or 2d potentials obey the suitable power laws for spatial variation .",
    "the atom trapping in toroidal or ring shaped geometry is useful for the study of coherence , super - fluidity , josephson oscillations etc of the confined quantum gases @xcite in low dimensions , besides having the applications in the realization of an atom gyroscope .",
    "the proposals and realizations of the ring shaped atom traps have been reported by several groups in the recent past employing various techniques .",
    "the use of static magnetic traps superimposed with a strong rf - field , called rf - dressed magnetic traps , appear promising due to flexibility and control available on the generated trapping potentials @xcite .",
    "the reports on ring shaped traps include the use of a specially designed magnetic coils for ring shaped quadrupole trap @xcite , a rf - dressed magnetic trap in combination with a standing wave pattern of an optical beam @xcite , and a rf - dressed magnetic trap in combination with a sheet type dipole laser beam @xcite . in an interesting work , using the hollow beams and an optical lattice , @xcite have proposed and demonstrated the generation of ring optical lattice for trapping of the superfluid atomic systems to use as qubits .    in the rf - dressed magnetic trap ,",
    "an atom experiences the adiabatic potential which is position dependent eigen - energy of the dressed - state of the atom while it interacts with the static and oscillating magnetic fields .",
    "this type of adiabatic potentials , also referred as rf - dressed potentials , can be handled with less complexity as compared to the potentials of optical beams .",
    "these adiabatic potentials also permit ample control over the generated potential landscape which can be tuned by tuning the amplitude , frequency and phase of the time varying rf fields @xcite . depending upon the rf field parameters",
    ", the rf - dressed potentials can offer exquisite trapping geometries like multiple - wells , asymmetric arcs , ring traps and rotating ( or oscillating ) toroidal traps @xcite .",
    "such non - trivial trapping geometries are considered important in conventional as well as miniaturised atom traps @xcite for various applications .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate the trapping of cold @xmath0 atoms in a toroidal geometry using a rf - dressed quadrupole magnetic trap .",
    "as compared to the earlier approaches , in which the toroidal trap was formed either using a rf - dressed magnetic trap and dipole potential of a laser beam @xcite or using a specially designed magnetic coils for ring shaped quadrupole traps @xcite , our method is simple to implement as it requires only a rf - dressed quadrupole magnetic trap . in our method ,",
    "the atom - cloud trapped in the quadrupole trap in @xmath1 state is first exposed to a weak rf field ( with frequency sweep ) for evaporative cooling , and then the stronger rf - field at a different frequency is used to transfer the cloud to the rf - dressed potential . the rf - field used for dressing",
    "is also be subjected to a small range frequency sweep ( few mhz ) to obtain a clean toroidal shape of the trapped cloud .",
    "the observed life - time of atoms in rf - dressed potential is longer than that in a bare quadrupole trap due to suppression of majorana flips in the rf - dressed potential .",
    "it is also demonstrated that a single rf source and antenna can be used for the evaporative cooling as well as for the rf - dressing to trap atoms in the toroidal geometry .    in this work ,",
    "it is further experimentally demonstrated that use of an additional rf - field along the quadrupole trap axis , in presence of the linearly polarized rf - field perpendicular to the trap axis , gives rises to asymmetry in the trapped atom cloud on the ring , with the cloud being held at a particular position on the ring .",
    "these results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions . since the position of trapped cloud can be altered by altering the phase of the axial rf - field @xcite , the modulation of the phase of the field can provide an opportunity to rotate the cloud along the ring . as compared to use of a dipole laser to stir the cloud",
