    "a problem of considerable interest in both mathematics and physics is to determine the asymptotics of the distribution functions @xmath0 of an orthonormal basis @xmath1 of eigenfunctions of a laplacian ( or similar hamiltonian ) on a compact manifold ( see @xcite ) . in general , it is hopelessly difficult to obtain more than crude bounds on such distribution functions , which of course control the @xmath2-norms of the eigenfunctions .",
    "numerical analyses and heuristics from quantum chaos and disordered systems suggest however a rich picture in which the asymptotics of @xmath3 is related to the classical dynamics underlying the eigenvalue problem .",
    "( some references will be discussed at the end of the introduction . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a rather complete analysis of the limit distribution of eigenfunctions in one of the few settings where such a detailed analysis is possible , namely where the phase space is a toric khler variety @xmath4 .",
    "let us recall the definitions ( see  1 for details ) .",
    "toric varieties are complex manifolds on which the complex torus @xmath5 acts with an open dense orbit . by a toric khler variety we mean a toric variety equipped with a khler form @xmath6 that is invariant under the underlying real torus @xmath7 .",
    "the action of @xmath8 is hamiltonian with respect to @xmath9 , and thus toric varieties are models of completely integrable systems .",
    "they are of a very special type because integrable systems usually generate an @xmath10 action rather than a @xmath8 action .",
    "although there are rigidity theorems limiting the class of such examples in the world of real riemannian manifolds @xcite , toric varieties provide a plentiful collection in the world of complex manifolds .    the torus action can be ` quantized ' or linearized on the hilbert space completion of the coordinate ring @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a holomorphic line bundle with @xmath13 and where @xmath14 denotes the space of holomorphic sections of its @xmath15-th tensor power .",
    "this quantization is generally known as the holomorphic ( bargmann - fock ) representation in the physics literature .",
    "the space @xmath16 is spanned by joint eigenfunctions of the linearized @xmath5 action , which we refer to as ` monomials . ' in the fundamental case of @xmath17 , the joint eigenfunctions are the monomials given in an affine chart by @xmath18 the monomials lift ( by homogenization ) to homogeneous monomials on @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath20 is a smooth projective toric variety ; i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an integral delzant polytope ( see  [ background ] ) .",
    "then the linearized @xmath7 action is generated by @xmath24 commuting operators @xmath25 , @xmath26 on @xmath27 which preserve @xmath28 , and the joint spectrum of the eigenvalue problem @xmath29 consists of lattice points @xmath30 .",
    "our main results concern the asymptotics of their distribution functions @xmath31 with @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath34 of @xmath35 is the pull - back of the fubini - study norm under a monomial embedding of the form @xmath36 : ( { { \\mathbb c}}^*)^m \\to { { { \\mathbb c}}{{\\mathbb p}}}^{d}\\;,\\qquad p\\cap{{\\mathbb z}}^m=\\{{\\alpha}(1),\\dots,{\\alpha}(d+1)\\}\\;,\\ ] ] for a choice of constants @xmath37 .",

    "i.e. _ it does not depend on the geometry of the manifold @xmath80 , and is given by a logarithmic power of the form @xmath112 with some constant @xmath113 .",
    "the logarithmic power appears because the @xmath114-normalized monomials are close to gaussian around the peak set @xmath115 on a vector space of dimension @xmath116 ( or dimension @xmath117 for the boundary lattice cases ) .",

    ", our results pertain to phase space distribution of eigenfunctions ( husimi distributions ) rather than to their configuration space distribution . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only prior example in dimension @xmath139 for which the limit distribution of eigenfunctions has been determined is the case of certain ( so - called ) hecke eigenfunctions of discrete quantum cat maps , due to kurlberg - rudnick @xcite .",
    "they work in a simpler discrete model rather than the holomorphic model .",
    "the main result of kurlberg - rudnick @xcite is that the distribution functions of ( un - scaled ) eigenfunctions tend to the semi - circle law .",
    "their method was to relate the eigenfunctions to exponential sums studied by katz @xcite and to apply the value distribution of exponential sums .",
    "since value distribution depends on the representation , it is not clear that the same semi - circle law would hold for hecke eigenfunctions in the holomorphic ( bargmann - fock ) representation , and this appears to be a challenging and interesting problem .",
    "part of the motivation for this paper was to set a baseline for eigenfunction distribution problems by studying a class of explicitly solvable examples .",
    "it would also be interesting to study the limit distribution of real eigenfunctions in the schrdinger representation , i.e. on the configuration space rather than the phase space .",
    "to our knowledge , the physics results mainly pertain to these configuration space results .",
    "the cases most studied and speculated about are those of chaotic or disordered systems . when eigenfunctions are delocalized , their spatial distribution is conjectured to be gaussian ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the opposite regime",
    "where the eigenfunctions of disordered systems are exponentially localized , the expected distribution in the low amplitude ( tail ) region is given by a power of a logarithm @xcite , precisely the one we obtained in the high amplitude ( center ) region .",
    "the reason is that the distribution law is universal and gaussian in the tail region for exponentially localized eigenfunctions of disordered systems @xcite , while it is universal and gaussian in the center for our problem ( theorem [ pointww ] ) .",
    "the only studies we have located which are related to distribution laws of integrable eigenfunctions are those of one of the authors with j. a. toth ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and that of berry - hannay - ozorio de almeida @xcite , which describes the asymptotic expansions of @xmath140 norms ( moment intensities ) of real oscillatory integrals of several stable types .",
    "such oscillatory integrals define quasimodes for a quantum integrable system , and in generic cases one can express eigenfunctions as oscillatory integrals of various kinds @xcite . in general",
    ", many possible kinds of oscillatory integrals could arise , including ones associated to singular lagrangean tori .",
    "hence , one can only expect complete results in special cases .",
    "to take the simplest example , our methods could be adapted to find the scaling limit distributions of squares of the standard spherical harmonics @xmath141 on @xmath142 ( or @xmath143 ) .",
    "these eigenfunctions are also joint eigenfunctions of commuting operators which generate a quantum torus action . to our knowledge ,",
    "the distribution laws of even such simple eigenfunctions are unknown at this time .",

    "the distribution function @xmath728 of the measure @xmath729 is given by @xmath730 the distribution function @xmath731 defined above can be expressed , in terms of the distribution function @xmath732 for the measure @xmath720 , as @xmath733 we should note that the total mass of the measure @xmath729 is @xmath734 , and hence it tends to infinity as @xmath15 goes to infinity . but its @xmath137-th moment satisfies , for each positive integer @xmath137 , @xmath735      furthermore , by , the measure @xmath737 is a finite measure on the real line whose support lies in a bounded interval in @xmath736 which is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the sequence of the finite measures @xmath737 on the real line has a weak limit , say @xmath738 , and it must satisfy        let @xmath221 be a positive constant , and let @xmath741 be a positive integer .",
    "let @xmath738 be a probability measure on the real line such that @xmath742 then @xmath738 must coincide with the measure @xmath743 where @xmath744 [ momentlemma ]    we shall use the following formula : @xmath745 to compute the fourier transform @xmath746 of the measure @xmath738 satisfying the condition in the lemma . substituting @xmath747 , @xmath748 in the above formula , we get @xmath749 and hence @xmath750 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ mldist ] . _ the rescaled distribution function @xmath728 for @xmath90 of the measure @xmath756 is given by @xmath757 where @xmath758 is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath759 . now set @xmath760 and write @xmath761 by corollary [ cm ] , we know that the sequence of finite measures @xmath762 converges weakly to the probability measure @xmath763 . for fixed @xmath90 , by approximating the function @xmath764 by a sequence of continuous functions , and by using the lebesgue convergence theorem , one easily obtains that , for every @xmath765 , @xmath766      in the previous section , we derived the limit of the rescaled distribution functions @xmath728 . in the definition of the rescaled function @xmath728 , the parameter @xmath767 is rescaled by the factor @xmath768 so that it tends to @xmath769 as @xmath33 .",
    "then the corresponding volume @xmath770 is of order @xmath771 .",
    "this was the reason why we need to multiply the volume by the extra factor @xmath768 in the definition of the rescaled distribution functions .",
    "as a result , the limit distribution has a universal form ( theorem [ mldist ] ) .",
    "however , one may ask , of course , what the limit of the non - rescaled distributions @xmath772 is . but , for each fixed @xmath773 , @xmath774 as @xmath33 by theorem [ pointww ] and proposition [ localss ] . therefore , we need to replace @xmath772 by @xmath775 for an appropriate sequence @xmath776 of positive functions in @xmath90 which compensate for the flattening rate",
    ". our sequence will satisfy the conditions @xmath777 as @xmath33 and @xmath778 for a function @xmath779 .",
    "we then have the following limit distribution law :    [ thnonrescaled ] let @xmath780 satisfy .",
    "then @xmath781 in particular , by taking the function @xmath782 as @xmath783 , we have @xmath784 if @xmath70 is in the interior @xmath60 of the polytope @xmath23 , we have @xmath785 [ tnonrescaled ]    the proof of is the same as that for and , and follows from and lemma [ volume22 ] .",

    "thus , we obtain @xmath793 this combined with lemma [ volume22 ] shows the assertion .",
    "our final aim is to prove theorem [ unrescal ] , which gives the asymptotic limit of the distribution function @xmath794 itself without any rescaling .",
    "since , by theorem [ pointww ] and propositions [ localss ] and [ localv ] , the monomial @xmath795 decays exponentially away from the corresponding invariant torus @xmath796 , it is obvious that @xmath794 tends to zero as @xmath33 .",
