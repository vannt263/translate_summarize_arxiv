    "the spin of a particle is an interesting degree of freedom in quantum theory .",
    "recently , peres , scudo , and terno  @xcite have shown that in special relativity the spin entropy ( i.e. , the von neumann entropy of a spin state ) of a particle is not invariant under lorentz transformations unless the particle is in a momentum eigenstate .",
    "namely , even if the spin state is pure in one frame of reference , it may become mixed in another frame of reference .",
    "the origin of this spin decoherence is that the lorentz transformation entangles the spin and momentum via the wigner rotation  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement then produces spin entropy by a partial trace over the momentum .    in this paper",
    ", we study the spin state of a particle moving in a gravitational field to show its decoherence by the effects of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "our result implies that even if the spin state is pure at one spacetime point , it may become mixed at another spacetime point . this spin decoherence is derived from the curvature of spacetime caused by the gravitational field .",
    "such a spacetime curvature entails a local description of spin by local lorentz frame due to a breakdown of the global rotational symmetry .",
    "the motion of a particle is thus accompanied by the change of frame , which can increase the spin entropy analogous to the case of special relativity . as an example",
    ", we consider a particle in a circular orbit around a static spherically - symmetric object using the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "consider a wave packet of a spin-@xmath3 particle with mass @xmath4 in a gravitational field .",
    "the gravitational field is described by a curved spacetime with metric in general relativity . nevertheless , despite the spacetime curvature",
    ", we can locally describe this wave packet as if it were in a flat spacetime , since a curved spacetime locally looks like flat .",
    "more precisely , for any spacetime point we can find a coordinate system in which the metric becomes the minkowski one .",
    "the coordinate transformation from a general coordinate system @xmath5 to this local lorentz frame @xmath6 can be carried out using a vierbein ( or a tetrad ) @xmath7 and its inverse @xmath8 defined by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metric in the general coordinate system and @xmath11 is the minkowski metric with @xmath12 .",
    "the vierbein then transforms a tensor in the general coordinate system into that in the local lorentz frame , and vice versa .",
    "for example , momentum @xmath13 in the general coordinate system can be transformed into that in the local lorentz frame via the relation @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we describe the wave packet as in the case of special relativity  @xcite using a local lorentz frame at the spacetime point @xmath15 where the centroid of the wave packet is located . since a momentum eigenstate of the particle is labeled by four - momentum @xmath16 and by the @xmath17-component @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) of spin  @xcite as @xmath21 , the wave packet can be expressed by a linear combination @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a lorentz - invariant volume element . from the normalization condition",
    "@xmath24 the coefficient @xmath25 must satisfy @xmath26    to obtain the spin state of this wave packet , we take the trace of the density matrix @xmath27 over the momentum , @xmath28 the spin entropy is then given by the von neumann entropy of this reduced density matrix : @xmath29.\\ ] ] moreover , the spin operator for the wave packet is defined by @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the pauli matrices . note that this spin is not dirac spin but wigner one  @xcite",
    "as is well known , dirac spin , which corresponds to the index of @xmath32-component dirac spinor , is not a conserved quantity in a relativistic regime and thus is not suitable degree of freedom for labelling one - particle states .",
    "in contrast , wigner spin is a conserved quantity suitable for labelling one - particle states , because it is defined using the particle s rest frame .",
    "suppose that the centroid of the wave packet is moving with four - velocity @xmath33 normalized as @xmath34 ; this motion is not necessarily geodesic in the presence of an external force . after an infinitesimal proper time @xmath35 , the centroid moves to a new point @xmath36 and",
    "then the wave packet is described by the local lorentz frame at the new point .",
    "this change in the local lorentz frame is represented by a lorentz transformation @xmath37 , where @xmath38.\\ ] ] in addition to this change , the acceleration by an external force is also interpreted as a lorentz transformation .",
    "thus , the motion of the wave packet is equivalent to a lorentz transformation @xmath39 , where  @xcite @xmath40 \\label{eq : ill}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the momentum and acceleration of the centroid in the local lorentz frame @xmath41 ,    \\label{eq : momcen } \\\\",
    "a^a(x)&={e^{a}_{\\phantom{a}\\mu}}(x)\\,\\left[\\,u^\\nu(x )   \\nabla_\\nu u^\\mu(x)\\,\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that even if the wave packet moves as straight as possible along a geodesic curve , this lorentz transformation may be nonzero in general relativity because of the first term .",
    "since spin entropy is not invariant under a lorentz transformation  @xcite , neither is it invariant during the motion of the wave packet . note that a lorentz transformation rotates the spin of a particle through an angle that depends on the particle s momentum ; this rotation is known as wigner rotation .",
    "the momentum eigenstate @xmath21 thus transforms under the lorentz transformation ( [ eq : ill ] ) as  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 unitary matrix that represents a wigner rotation given by  @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "taking the trace of the density matrix @xmath47 over the momentum , we obtain the spin state @xmath48 and the spin entropy @xmath49 of the wave packet in the local lorentz frame at the new point @xmath50",
    ". however , the spin has been entangled with the momentum by the lorentz transformation ( [ eq : ill ] ) , since the wigner rotation ( [ eq : deflw ] ) of spin depends on the momentum . due to this entanglement ,",
    "the new entropy @xmath49 is not , in general , equal to the original one @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the spin state may decohere during the motion of the wave packet by the effects of general relativity .",
    "as an example in general relativity , we consider the schwarzschild spacetime , which is the unique static spherically - symmetric solution of einstein s equation in vacuum . in the spherical coordinate system @xmath52 , the metric is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 with the schwarzschild radius @xmath55 . in the schwarzschild spacetime , we introduce an observer at each point who is static with respect to the time @xmath56 using a static local lorentz frame .",
    "the vierbein ( [ eq : vierbein ] ) is then @xmath57    suppose that the centroid of the wave packet is moving along a circular trajectory of radius @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) with a constant velocity @xmath60 on the equatorial plane @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the four - velocity of the centroid is then given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined by @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that at the initial point the wave packet has the definite values @xmath65 and @xmath66 but is gaussian in @xmath67 with width @xmath68 : @xmath69,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the momentum of the centroid ( [ eq : momcen ] ) along the @xmath71-direction .    a wave packet ( small circle ) going around a static spherically - symmetric object ( large circle ) .",
    "the @xmath72- and @xmath71-axes of the local lorentz frame are illustrated at the initial and final points . ]",
    "clearly , the spin entropy of this wave packet is zero at the initial point , since the spin is separable from the momentum .",
    "however , after a proper time @xmath73 of the particle , spin entropy is generated by the gravity and acceleration , i.e. , by the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ill ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the generated spin entropy @xmath51 as a function of the proper time @xmath73 in the case of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the spin entropy @xmath51 at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 as a function of the proper time @xmath73 normalized by @xmath77 . ]",
    "the spin state of the wave packet decoheres to a mixed state and becomes maximally mixed ( @xmath78 ) in the limit of @xmath79 .",
    "the characteristic decoherence time is given by the inverse of @xmath80 figure  [ fig3 ] shows this value @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 when @xmath74 .",
    "the inverse of the characteristic decoherence time @xmath81 , normalized by @xmath83 , as a function of @xmath82 at @xmath74 . ]",
    "no decoherence occurs ( @xmath84 ) at the spatial infinity @xmath85 , whereas extremely rapid decoherence occurs ( @xmath86 ) near the schwarzschild radius @xmath87 .",
    "the spin state does not decohere also at @xmath88 , because the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ill ] ) is canceled by the second term .",
    "of course , this spin decoherence is very slow in the gravitational field of the earth @xmath89 .",
    "for example , when a wave packet is at rest in the international space station going around the earth , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the characteristic decoherence time is @xmath92 years .",
    "we have shown that spin entropy is generated when a particle moves in a gravitational field .",
    "the spin state evolves into a mixed state even if the particle moves as straight as possible along a geodesic curve .",
    "this decoherence is due to the spacetime curvature by gravity .",
