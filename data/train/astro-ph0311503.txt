    "the material content of the universe is commonly assumed to be a mixture of fluids , such as radiation or non - relativistic matter , and scalar fields , either driving a period of early universe inflation @xcite or playing the role of dark energy ( quintessence ) in the present universe @xcite .",
    "the latter possibility has motivated a number of works devoted to the study of cosmological perturbations in a multi - component system consisting of fluids and a scalar field , for instance refs .",
    "nevertheless , the literature contains some contradictory statements concerning the properties of such perturbations .    in this paper",
    "we aim to resolve these discrepancies and will provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem .",
    "we will study the role of intrinsic entropy perturbation in the scalar field , and whether the notion of adiabaticity is preserved by the dynamics of the multi - component system when the evolution of such an intrinsic entropy perturbation is explicitly accounted for . in the process of doing so",
    ", we will discuss the number of degrees of freedom which completely describe the system and we will find a highly - efficient formulation of the perturbation equations including the effects of spatial gradients .    finally , using our formalism",
    "we will specifically discuss the quintessence scenario .",
    "we will correct some common misconceptions , discuss the evolution of entropy perturbations , and clearly show the importance of initial conditions when considering late - time perturbations .",
    "in particular , we will show that entropy perturbations can be enhanced by the evolution of the field and may still be present when its density is no longer negligible .",
    "this is an important result which has generally been overlooked when studying dark energy models .",
    "our approach builds on an earlier paper by malquarti and liddle @xcite , and we will largely follow the notation of that article but with some differences in definitions .",

    "when the fluid is very sub - dominant ( @xmath72 ) , we have @xmath73 and therefore on large scales @xmath34 decays exponentially remains constant in the special case @xmath74 , but when the field is dominant this equation of state is usually not considered and anyway would rapidly evolve towards @xmath75 . ] with decay rate @xmath76 , dynamically recovering the single scalar field case for which the intrinsic entropy perturbation vanishes ( cf .",
    "section  [ dof ] ) .    when the fluid is completely absent , the matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eqmat ] ) reduce to @xmath77 matrices , in the variables @xmath15 , @xmath52 and @xmath34 , but the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ const_sf ] ) allows to eliminate one more degree of freedom .",
    "for example , using eq .",
    "( [ const_sf ] ) one can find @xmath78 matrices for @xmath52 and @xmath34 , or if one additionally goes to the large - scale limit , the constraint equation eq .",
    "( [ const_sf ] ) forces @xmath34 to vanish and gives @xmath67 as a @xmath78 matrix for @xmath15 and @xmath52 .",
    "the adiabatic condition requires that the relative entropy perturbation @xmath56 and the intrinsic entropy perturbation @xmath34 vanish . from our equations",
    "it is immediately clear that on large scales ( @xmath58 , so that only @xmath67 need be considered ) if the perturbations are initially adiabatic then @xmath56 and @xmath34 remain zero for all times . in this case",
    "@xmath52 is constant and @xmath15 rapidly approaches its asymptotic value @xmath79 ( for constant or sufficiently slowly varying @xmath80 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that adiabaticity on large scales holds regardless of any time - dependence of the background variables such as @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( this was already pointed out in ref .",
    "in fact , preservation of adiabaticity is implied by the separate universe approach to large - scale perturbations @xcite .",
    "however adiabaticity will be broken once the perturbations move out of the large - scale regime , with the matrices @xmath68 and @xmath69 sourcing @xmath56 and @xmath34 through the curvature perturbations @xmath52 and @xmath15 . in particular , note that this is also true for the single scalar field case , as is evident from looking at eq .",
    "( [ const_sf ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as we will see , if an isocurvature perturbation is initially present it can be wiped out on large scales by the scalar field dynamics .",
    "aspects of these results have appeared in previous works @xcite , but without noting that adiabaticity is always preserved on large scales .",
    "our set of variables makes unambiguously clear the fact that the adiabatic condition is not an instantaneous notion on large scales , and holds independently of the evolution of the background .",
    "in this section , we discuss the large - scale evolution of perturbations in quintessence scenarios . as described in the appendix , before the quintessence field starts dominating the evolution of the universe its dynamics can feature up to four different regimes during which the coefficients of the matrix @xmath67 are constant .",
    "these are summarized in table  [ val_reg ] .",
    "note that , as compared to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we altered the names of two regimes ( potential i and ii ) in order to make our explanations clearer .",
    "now , following ref .",
    "@xcite , for each regime it is possible to perform an eigenvector decomposition of the matrix @xmath67 and therefore compute analytically the large - scale evolution of the perturbations ( i.e.  during each regime @xmath83 can be written as a sum of four terms proportional to @xmath84 for @xmath85 to @xmath38 respectively )",
    ". however , the matching conditions between the different regimes are not obvious as @xmath56 and @xmath34 contain non - trivial functions of the background . in that respect , the formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite is more appropriate when following the modes over different regimes , since to a first approximation @xmath15 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 can be taken as conserved through the transitions between regimes .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     first of all , it is easy to find that for any regime @xmath67 possesses two eigenvectors @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the eigenvalue of @xmath90 .",
    "these two vectors correspond to the two well - known adiabatic modes , the first one being constant , and the second one rapidly decaying .",
    "now , it is possible to find the two remaining entropy modes for a general case , but they can not be expressed in a simple form .",
    "nevertheless , it is straightforward and more clear to perform an eigenmode decomposition by considering each regime separately .",
    "the modes are given for each regime in table  [ modes ] .",
    "for simplicity , we do not display complicated expressions ; for a detailed analysis the reader should refer to ref .",
    "most of these results have already been discussed in that paper , but here we would like to comment further in the light of our new set of variables and new findings .",

    "this is due to the scaling and attractor properties of that regime .",
    "more striking is the fast - growing mode during the kinetic regime and the constant mode during the second potential regime .",
    "this contradicts the claim by brax et al .",
    "@xcite that the final value of the quintessence perturbations is insensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "the difference comes from the fact that these authors considered the basic variable @xmath105 and its time derivative .",
    "they found that there are two decaying modes for every regime .",
    "however , this does not mean that observationally - relevant variables ( such as @xmath45 ) are decaying , since one has to take into account the evolution of background quantities ( such as @xmath106 ) as well .",
    "our set of variables is therefore more appropriate .",
    "since in general we expect that there could be an initial relative entropy perturbation @xmath56 ( for example in the case of a quintessence field present during inflation @xcite ) and since @xmath56 sources @xmath34 , we can expect a non - zero intrinsic entropy on large scales which would then evolve according to our set of equations eqs .",
    "( [ sprime ] ) and ( [ gamprime ] ) .",
    "now , using the results given in the appendix , eqs .",
    "( [ eqdnk ] ) and ( [ eqdnpi ] ) , we can show that the growth of @xmath34 during the kinetic regime  @xmath107  is exactly compensated by its subsequent decay during the potential regime i  @xmath108 . as a result , after the three regimes preceding the tracker regime , entropy modes are neither enhanced nor suppressed .",
    "however , as shown in the appendix , according to the initial conditions , the potential energy of the field can undergo a very large drop before it reaches a constant value and the kinetic regime starts . in general",
    ", this transition phase could last a non - negligible number of @xmath109-foldings and would feature the same eigenmodes as the kinetic regime , in particular the same growing mode .",
    "since this first phase of growth would not be compensated by the decay during the first potential regime , there remains the possibility that entropy modes may be enhanced at the beginning of the tracker regime .",
    "now , if the tracker regime is not long enough to erase completely these entropy perturbations by the time the field becomes non - negligible , we may be able to see an imprint of these initial perturbations in observations @xcite . as a result , we can see that in a quintessence scenario the initial conditions , as well as the history of the evolution of the background , are relevant when considering the late - time value of the perturbations .    in this respect",
    "many different assumptions can be made . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kneller and strigari assumed equipartition as an initial value for the field , and in most cases this led to a field dynamics featuring a very long kinetic regime followed by the potential regimes and no tracker regime . in ref .",
    "@xcite , de la macorra studied an actual physical model in which the quintessence field is a dark condensate which arises after a phase transition .",
    "its evolution starts in the kinetic regime and again does not feature a tracker regime . in both scenarios entropy perturbations would still be present today .",
    "alternatively , malquarti and liddle @xcite studied the evolution of a quintessence model during inflation in order to investigate the initial conditions of the quintessence field at the beginning of the radiation - dominated era .",
    "they found that typically the tracker starts at low redshift after a long period of potential regime ii , but again , as a result , entropy perturbations generated during inflation could still lead to observable consequences . finally , note that in general the initial entropy perturbations do not need to be of the order @xmath15 and",
    "may be much larger .      in order to illustrate our results",
    ", we carried out simulations for two quintessence models in a realistic universe ( with radiation , dark matter and dark energy ) .",
    "the first example is an inverse power - law model  @xcite @xmath110 , with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , starting with the initial conditions at @xmath113 given by @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "first , we can clearly identify these regimes and see the growing , constant and decaying behavior of @xmath56 and @xmath34 corresponding to the modes displayed in table  [ modes ] .",
    "suggest , @xmath56 is constant during the potential regime i. this is because @xmath34 is many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath56 , and @xmath117 is not exactly @xmath118 . ]",
    "we note the oscillations during the tracker regime and the non - trivial evolution through the transitions ( yet keeping the same order of magnitude ) .",
    "we also observe that in this particular case the transition phase towards the kinetic regime is too short to enhance the entropy mode significantly , leading to the result that at the beginning of the tracker regime @xmath56 and @xmath34 have about the same amplitude as at the initial stage .",
    "in other words they are neither enhanced nor suppressed by the dynamics of the field , until tracking begins .",

    "in addition , in order to observe the transition phase preceding the kinetic regime , we also display @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the potential energy density of the field  as described in the appendix , the kinetic regime starts when @xmath129 drops under @xmath130 .",
    "first , we note that although @xmath126 initially , it evolves very quickly to be of the same order as @xmath56 ; as previously explained , this is due to the coupling between @xmath56 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , we observe the same behavior as for the first example , but this time we can see that the transition phase towards the kinetic regime lasts a few @xmath109-foldings . as a result ,",
    "the entropy modes at the beginning of the tracker regime are nearly a factor @xmath131 larger than initially .",
    "this shows that , as discussed in section  [ an_des ] , entropy modes can be enhanced before the field reaches the tracker regime .",
    "we have shown that , in general , one must take into account the initial conditions for the quintessence field and its perturbations in order to make any prediction .",
    "we have explored the nature of scalar perturbations for a universe filled with both a scalar field and a perfect fluid .",
    "we have introduced a useful set of variables and have provided a full analysis including spatial gradients . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the isocurvature perturbation modes and on the degrees of freedom which completely characterize the system . while for the case where only the scalar field is present its intrinsic entropy perturbation is forced to vanish at linear order for superhorizon scales , the presence of a fluid",
    " even if sub - dominant  allows the possibility for such an intrinsic contribution to be present on large scales .",
    "however , in the case of a very sub - dominant fluid the intrinsic entropy of the scalar field decays , dynamically recovering the single scalar field situation .    we have recast the basic evolution equations in a rather simple matrix formalism in terms of the gauge - invariant variables for the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , taking into account the dynamics of the perturbations when a given wavelength re - enters the horizon . in particular , we have obtained an equation for the intrinsic entropy perturbation which shows that , on large scales , an initial adiabatic condition is indeed preserved , regardless of the evolution .",
    "only when the perturbations approach the horizon are the adiabatic and entropy perturbations fully coupled together .",
    "finally , we have applied our formalism to the quintessence scenario . in this case",
    "we have analyzed the large - scale evolution of the adiabatic and entropy perturbations in the different regimes which the quintessence scalar field dynamics may feature .",
    "as is well known , entropy perturbations are suppressed during the tracking regime , but , as already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , during the kinetic regime one entropy mode undergoes an exponential growth .",
    "we have shown that it is then exactly compensated by an exponential decay during the first potential regime and then remains constant during the second potential regime .",
    "therefore , after the three regimes preceding the tracker regime , entropy modes are neither enhanced nor suppressed . however , we discussed the remaining possibility of an enhancement during the short transition phase preceding the kinetic regime .",
    "we have studied two special cases numerically and have confirmed our analytical analysis . moreover ,",
    "we have observed that , in one of the cases , at the beginning of the tracker regime , entropy perturbations are larger than initially , and therefore we have concluded that entropy mode enhancement is possible .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that in general it is incorrect to assume that the observational imprint of quintessence perturbations will be independent of the initial conditions , because entropy perturbations can still be present when the quintessence energy density is no longer negligible .",
    "note that this can happen as soon as the tracker starts , long before quintessence domination .",
    "in this case , entropy perturbations would feed curvature perturbations , but then would slowly decay to become negligible today .",

    "@xmath142 shortly after @xmath138 ( at the latest when @xmath143 ) , the potential freezes at some value @xmath144 corresponding to the tracker configuration at a later time @xmath145 , and , since @xmath146 for @xmath147 , it remains frozen until @xmath148 . in this case , the evolution of @xmath149 can easily be computed analytically .",
    "we assume that at @xmath148 the tracker solution has an equation of state @xmath150 , express @xmath151 as a function of @xmath152 and @xmath150 , and for @xmath153 we find @xmath154 ^ 2 { \\,\\mathrm{,}}\\end{split } \\label{t_sol}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is a constant of integration depending on the initial conditions .",
    "let us explain this behavior .",
    "starting from the time @xmath142 the field is in the kinetic regime : @xmath156 and @xmath157 . at some time @xmath158 the field reaches the configuration @xmath159 , and since the friction term is still extremely large ( @xmath160 ) the kinetic term keeps on decaying and the field enters the first potential regime : @xmath161 and @xmath162 . at some time @xmath163",
    "the term @xmath164 can balance the friction term and @xmath149 starts growing again .",
    "here begins the second potential regime : @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "finally , at @xmath148 the field enters the tracker regime : @xmath167 .",
    "note that the whole evolution described above goes through all the possible initial conditions .",
    "now we can compute a few parameters .",
    "first , using the solution for @xmath149 given in eq .",
    "( [ t_sol ] ) and noting that @xmath168 , it is straightforward to recover the values displayed in table  [ val_reg ] .",
    "in addition , let us define @xmath169 as the number of @xmath109-foldings that the field spends in the regime ` r ' and also @xmath170 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) , the fact that at @xmath142 and @xmath148 we have @xmath171 and the evolution for @xmath149 and @xmath133 described above , we find @xmath172 these last two results are used in section  [ an_des ] to show that the growth of one of the entropy modes during the kinetic regime is exactly compensated by its subsequent decay during the first potential regime .    for an overview of inflation",
