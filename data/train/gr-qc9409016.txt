    "in this contribution , i would like to present a particular speculation in a quite heuristic manner .",
    "it concerns the stabilization of scale factors belonging to internal spaces .",
    "the underlying physical problem is provided by the typical classical behaviour of scale factors in the very simplest higher - dimensional cosmological models ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) : some blow up , while the others usually collapse , either approaching zero asymptotically or running into a singularity after a finite amount of proper time (  crack of doom  ) . the papers @xcite and @xcite , as well as the references contained therein provide examples for these two types . even those rare classical solutions which evolve towards finite values of the internal scale factors are unstable against small perturbations  in contrast to what we observe ( clap your hands , and you will certainly not cause an internal space to collapse ) .",
    "stabilization of an internal space can be achieved in more sophisticated models in which a particular interaction between gravity and matter may capture some of the scale factors near a ( possibly local ) minimum of an effective potential .",
    "( maybe the most popular approaches are those inspired by higher - dimensional supergravity theories ) . for a selection of some papers on this issue ,",
    "some authors considered an effective @xmath1-action for gravity @xcite , the use of finite temperature quantum field theoretic methods ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , or cosmological models based on the theory of superstrings @xcite .",
    "it is worth , however , thinking about the possible existence of pure gravity mechanisms causing a comparable effect in a logically and technically simpler way ( by  pure  i mean that matter enters a model in a very simple or even a more or less symbolic form , e.g. as a massive scalar field or a cosmological constant ) .",
    "one such possibility might be provided by the gravitational casimir effect @xcite , but this is not very much clear by now .",
    "another area in which a  pure gravity  solution to the stabilization problem may be looked for is marked by the minisuperspace approaches to quantum cosmology @xcite , based on a ( possibly path integral motivated ) wheeler - dewitt equation and boundary conditions for the wave function of the universe .",
    "concerning these attempts , one must say that only few solutions to few models are known .",
    "there is especially one model ",
    "maybe the most natural to consider in this context  that is remarkably resistent against analytical methods : a ten - dimensional space - time with @xmath0 as spatial sections , and a positive cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "( i will definitely refuse to assume the existence of a supergravity - inspired rank six antisymmetric tensor field which would generate stability of the @xmath3 by virtue of a freund - rubin mechanism @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "this model i will talk about , sometimes using @xmath4 for comparison .",
    "by the shorthand notations used above i mean the class of metrics @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the metric on the round unit three - sphere , and @xmath7 is the metric on the round unit six - sphere ( or on the flat unit six - torus , in which case the internal dimensions do not contribute a curvature term in the action ) .",
    "this model ( and , more general , @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) showed up in some of the lists given by other contributors at this conference ( e.g. sascha zhuk ) , and it was implicitly declared `` non - fully - integrable '' in the sense of not being reducible to an ( integrable ) toda system .",
    "we shall see that this characterization is possibly connected with physically desirable properties .",
    "the mathematical problem is that one has to treat the two scale factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 on essentially the same footing ",
    "there seem to be very few possibilities to get rid of one degree of freedom ( e.g. by perturbative approximations ) .",
    "this is in contrast , for example , to the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models with a single scalar field @xmath12 @xcite , where , in a first approximation , @xmath12 appears only through the effective cosmological constant @xmath13 , and the two dimensions of minisuperspace are reduced to one . as a consequence ,",
    "the application to ( [ metric ] ) of methods developed for simpler models @xcite is likely to be problematic , and we are far from knowing the set of all physically reasonable quantum states . some material on this model may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to develop my speculation ,",
    "let me outline briefly what one usually does in minisuperspace quantum cosmologies , using ( [ metric ] ) as a starting point .",
    "( for an excellent introduction to this subject see ref.@xcite . )",
    "the einstein - hilbert action for ten - dimensional gravity , including a ( positive ) gravitational constant and the usual boundary term that subtracts a divergence , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 the metric induced by @xmath17 on the boundary @xmath18 and @xmath19 the trace of its extrinsic curvature .",
    "the above choice of @xmath20 ensures the correct gravitational constant today . inserting ( [ metric ] )",
    ", one obtains an action @xmath21 that we will not display ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , but just mention that the total volume of the @xmath22 space sections is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 in the @xmath3 case ( then we define @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 in the @xmath27 case ( @xmath28 ) .    next we change variables according to @xmath29 and make the definition ( using @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) @xmath32 the last identity being valid only in the @xmath25 case when @xmath11 compactifies .",
    "( let us remark here that one could consider any @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) instead of @xmath3 , but then the prefactors and exponents in these definitions would be even more messy ) . in these new variables ,",
    "the action ( [ einsteinhilbert ] ) becomes @xmath35 where the potential is given by @xmath36 the corresponding euclidean action ( obtained by sending @xmath37 , thus changing ( [ metric ] ) into the riemannian metric @xmath38 ) reads @xmath39 the wheeler - dewitt metric reduces to @xmath40 , which shows that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are  lightlike  coordinates in minisuperspace ( both ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) .",
    "we define the  timelike  direction in minisuperspace by @xmath45 .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ s ] ) is the well - known energy constraint @xmath46 that has to vanish ( on the constrained phase space or on physical quantum states , respectively ) .",
    "the classical ( lorentzian ) solutions of this system must obey ( in the gauge @xmath47 ) @xmath48 with the + signs ( the first of these just meaning @xmath49 ) ; the corresponding euclidean solutions  following from variation of @xmath50  obey ( [ eqmotion ] ) with the  signs .",
    "lorentzian and euclidean solutions ( trajectories in minisuperspace ) describe ten - dimensional geometries when re - transformed and inserted into ( [ metric ] ) and its euclidean counterpart , respectively .",
    "the variables chosen are such that the form of the classical equations of motion is formally independent of @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "the transition to quantum mechanics is achieved by replacing @xmath51 in @xmath52 , thus leading to the wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath53 the operator ordering has been chosen in the only way that is consistent with general covariance under transformations of all three variables , including the lapse function @xcite .",
    "( let us note in brackets that by choosing other variables @xmath54 , one can achieve various forms of the potential @xmath55 by transforming the lapse as @xmath56 .",
    "however , the choice ( [ w ] ) seems to me to be the best one .",
    "having set up convenient variables , let us now look at some basic features of the model .",
    "( clearly , in view of ( [ eqmotion ] , [ wdw ] ) , all such features are contained in the potential @xmath57 , because the rest is fairly trivial ) .",
    "first we note that there is a curve @xmath58 ( which may be found by solving ( [ w ] ) with respect to @xmath42 ) , lying entirely in the interior of minisuperspace ( see fig.1 ) . in the region @xmath59",
    "( which extends to the axes @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , the euclidean solutions are necessarily timelike curves ( with respect to the wheeler - dewitt metric ) , the lorentzian ones are spacelike curves ( cf . the first equation of ( [ eqmotion ] ) ) .",
    "the opposite is of course true if @xmath62 .",
    "an escape of both scale factors @xmath63 to large values is only possible inside the @xmath62 region which one is tempted to call the ",
    "classical  one .",
    "the region @xmath59 could then be called the  quantum  or ",
    "euclidean  regime .",
    "note that the two asymptotic branches of the zero - potential curve ( @xmath64 for the  upper  and @xmath65 for the  lower  branch in fig.1 ) approach constant @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively ( which is , if @xmath68 , what one expects from a classical / quantum transition regime ) .",
    "moreover , the curve @xmath58 provides all points in which a classical euclidean solution may be matched smoothly to a lorentzian one .",
    "it is not quite clear which role euclidean trajectories should play in a sensible quantum cosmology , but in some of the most prominent approaches they provide a key of finding the state of the universe .",
    "euclidean trajectories describing regular ten - geometries emerge from the origin ( @xmath69 ) and behave there like @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "one usually singles out two particluar euclidean solutions as ",
    "instantons  : one being along the curve @xmath72 ( in @xmath59 ) and the other along @xmath73 ( in @xmath59 , too ) .",
    "they give rise to the riemannian ten - geometries @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively and are the only euclidean solutions starting at the origin and having a turning point ( @xmath76 , i.e. zero extrinsic curvature ) at @xmath58 .",
    "they are usually considered the preferred candidates describing the coming - into-(classical)existence of the universe by quantum tunneling @xcite . in fig.1 , these instantons as well as several other typical euclidean trajectories are displayed .    when expressed in terms of their proper - time ( @xmath77 ) , the lorentzian solutions either expand in both scale factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 exponentially ( thus describing inflation without compactification ) , or they expand in one scale factor and contract in the other , thereby entering the  quantum  region @xmath59 and finally collapsing towards one of the axes in a kasner - type singularity ( @xmath78 while @xmath79 , or vice versa ) .",
    "the only solutions that compactify are the lorentzian analogues of the two instantons ( lying on the same curves as these , but now in the region @xmath62 ) , and even these are unstable against small perturbations . each of these two very special solutions are characterized by one scale factor being actually constant ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ) . in the approaches that connect the instantons to the most probable classical evolution of the universe",
    "@xcite , this last number is interpreted as the actual kaluza - klein scale factor . in fig.2",
    ", some lorentzian trajectories are shown .    comparing this structure to the @xmath28 case",
    ", we find that there the zero - potential curve @xmath58 is just given by @xmath82 , and the lower asymptotic branch has disappeared .    can the transition from the classical trajectories satisfying ( [ eqmotion ] ) to the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) improve likelihood and stability of compactification ?",
    "let me as a starting point adopt the prescription of hartle and hawking @xcite for finding the  no - boundary-solution of ( [ wdw ] ) . in this approach ,",
    "the wave function is considered as a path integral @xmath83)$ ] over compact euclidean ten - geometries having the argument of @xmath84 ( a nine - geometry or , here , just a point @xmath85 ) as their boundary . the wkb - approximation scheme @xcite",
    "then tells us to compute @xmath86 for points @xmath85 near ( or on ) the zero - potential curve , where the euclidean action @xmath87 is taken along the euclidean trajectories .",
    "@xmath88 is a prefactor that may be estimated by wkb - methods , once @xmath50 is known .",
    "we would then have to take this @xmath89 as a boundary condition for the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) and evolve it into the region @xmath62 .",
    "there , @xmath84 is expected to develop a form @xmath90 .",
    "the phase @xmath91 is the action of a family of classical solutions that one may find using the hamilton - jacobi formalism @xcite .",
    "the probability measure is provided by the prefactor @xmath92 , and @xmath84 can be viewed as describing a superposition of a family of classical universes ( a particular one of course being ours ) .",
    "some of these universes inflate in both scale factors , and some will eventually re - enter the quantum region .",
    "only two classical paths ( namely the ones emerging from the two instantons by smooth continuation ) will undergo compactification of one scale factor  and although @xmath84 can be expected to be highly peaked around these ( as dominant contributions to the path integral ) , the situation is unsatisfactory as far as stability is concerned .",
    "( remember that i refuse the introduction of a stabilizing supergravity - inspired matter coupling ) .",
    "however , one encounters some complications in this model : to begin with , let us note that the euclidean action @xmath87 is not unique , since there are several euclidean trajectories connecting a given @xmath85 with the origin .",
    "( choosing the largest or the smallest of these would presumably not result into an approximate solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation at all , due to the effects at those points where two trajectories give equal @xmath50 ) .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the region @xmath59 according to the standard methods is questionable : since in a large portion of this region the curves @xmath93 are timelike with respect to the wheeler - dewitt metric , @xmath84 would have to be expected oscillatory there rather than exponential @xcite .",
    "this is however contrary to one s intuition about what should happen when internal spaces approach planck scale size .",
    "the question i would like to focus on is the following : what happens to the universe if it is described in the classical ( @xmath62 ) region by a trajectory that approaches the zero - potential curve , enters the region of negative @xmath57 and  when evolved further classically",
    " recollapses ?",
    "if @xmath84 in the region @xmath59 ( for @xmath41 and @xmath42 large ) is indeed a semi - classical state , one should expect the universe to run into a singularity .",
    "there are some remarks about similar situations in the literature , stating either that the universe actually _ will _ recollapse classically @xcite or that there might possibly occur some kind of collapse by tunneling @xcite . in any case ,",
    "such trajectories are usually not considered as important in the description of our universe .",
    "now , let us proceed ( very ) heuristically and retain  against possible objections  the notion that a physically sensible state has to qualify the region @xmath59 as a ",
    "quantum  or a  classically forbidden  domain ( at least if @xmath94 ) , irrespective of the fact that classical solutions do exist there formally .",
    "then the question is : what happens , if the universe re - enters into a classically forbidden region of superspace ?",
    "the intuitive answer is : tunneling .",
    "since i have no better recipe at hand ( maybe a path integral formalism would provide one ) , and since the euclidean trajectories are in general considered as a viable tool describing tunneling , i try to _ match a euclidean trajectory smoothly to the re - entering lorentzian one_. this euclidean trajectory will in general return to the curve @xmath58 and generate another semiclassical universe ( which might recollapse again and so forth ) .",
    "hence , we arrive at a procedure which tells us to evolve trajectories according to the classical equations of motion ( [ eqmotion ] ) , but with the respective signs in each region .",
    "these ( mixed ) trajectories correspond to metrics undergoing an infinite succession of signature changes .",
    "there are certainly many reasonable objections against such a procedure playing any role in the interpretation ( or construction ) of a state @xmath84 .",
    "one such objection is provided by the fact that just matching trajectories smoothly as described above does not automatically lead to smooth ten - geometries displaying signature change ( nor to a stationary point of the action @xmath95 or @xmath50 ) .",
    "optimal matching would rather demand vanishing extrinsic curvature @xcite at @xmath58 ( and this is in turn only possible for the two instantons , due to their turning point structure ) .",
    "but even this point is not so clear , because the recent discussion on signature change shows that weaker junction conditions may allow for reasonable classical evolution @xcite too .",
    "i will return to this in the very last remark of my talk .",
    "however , even if the mixed trajectories do not represent admissable geometries , it may well be that they are linked with dominant contributions to the path integral with respect to some measure .",
    "( recall that the structure of euclidean trajectories in the minisuperspace of the model we consider is rather involved , and to find the dominant ones for a given point @xmath85 is not a simple matter , even in the  standard  hartle - hawking approach @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is of course necessary to ask for the significance of the  time  variable @xmath96 along the euclidean pieces , and in which way such a construction is linked to physical predictions .",
    "however , there might be a more accurate version of this procedure , where the matching of trajectories is not understood individually ( one would expect a whole family of such mixed trajectories to build up a quantum state anyway ) .",
    "the weakest question one may make out of this is : is there a solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) which  drags  the universe approximately along such paths ?",
    "this could happen either in terms of some oscillating wkb - type wave function ( which is less likely ) or in terms of a non - oscillating @xmath84 displaying huge amplitudes in the according region of minisuperspace .",
    "( recall that  except in the semiclassical wkb - approximation  there is no viable and commonly accepted interpretation of solutions to ( [ wdw ] ) , especially when such high peaks occur in the absence of oscillations .",
    "this touches upon the most fundamental conceptual problems of quantum gravity @xcite , and therefore i can not even give a precise statement which mathematical properties such a wave function should have . )",
    "it is time now to look at the particular way , the euclidean / lorentzian mixed trajectories behave in the model we are considering . using simple numerical techniques , it turns out that there is a preferred region on the curve @xmath58 from which such trajectories emerge ( this region seems to consist of two pieces which are located near the turning points of the two instantons , and consist of points such that two different euclidean trajectories starting from the origin and meeting there have approximately the same action @xmath50 ) .",
    "fig.3 and fig.4 show two examples for mixed trajectories .",
    "they undergo  oscillations  , thereby wandering along one of the two asymptotic branches of @xmath58 .",
    "one of the two scale factors thereby approaches a finite limiting value in each case , the other one blows up . in fig.5 ,",
    "the data from fig.4 are re - expressed in terms of @xmath97 , where the time coordinate @xmath96 refers to the gauge @xmath47 .",
    "fig.6 provides a magnification of the same plot , showing that the  oscillation  of @xmath11 is actually a dampted one .",
    "hence , mixed trajectories correspond to metrics that  oscillate  in signature and display  as far as the values of the scale factors are concerned  perfect kaluza - klein behaviour .",
    "so , can the universe  reappear  due to quantum tunneling ?",
    "it is a subject for further research to look for solutions of ( [ wdw ] ) describing such a behaviour .",
    "let me however conclude with some remarks .",
    "first , such a compactification and stabilization mechanism would be quite general and independent of most features of matter coupling .",
    "it just requires the internal space to have non - vanishing ricci curvature .",
    "( note that in the @xmath4 model compactification of the @xmath27 can not happen in this way because the lower asymptotic branch of @xmath58 is missing ) .",
    "moreover , the compactified scale factor approaches @xmath98 , hence the whole mechanism works only if @xmath2 does not decay .",
    "it must be a fundamental part of the action ( and not just mimicking a @xmath13 which would disappear after an inflationary phase @xcite ) .",
    "a possible success of computations along these lines could certainly be connected with a new aspect in the interpretational problems of the state @xmath84 , because in some sense the universe would remain permanently a quantum one .",
    "one would have to work out how the arrow of time comes about , and how the universe as a whole is experienced .",
    "naively , one would expect that a state in which @xmath11 compactifies ( cf .",
    "fig.5 ) describes an effectively three - dimensional world expanding as @xmath99 .",
    "but why do we observe a classical space - time with lorentzian signature , and how does @xmath10 evolve with respect to an ( effectively ) lorentzian time ?    let me add a comment that emerged in discussions at this meeting : when trying to compute @xmath87 along euclidean trajectories , one would  as already mentioned ",
    "encounter different , competing contributions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , say .",
    "this degree of non - uniqueness can  by virtue of rather involved branching phenomena ",
    "result into the mathematical structure necessary to develop non - expected compactification solutions and at the same time into the feature of being  non - integrable  in some sense .",
    "hence , the difficulties in finding analytic solutions may possibly be compensated by new physical effects . in this concern , there is also still something to learn about the @xmath28 model ( where the @xmath102 would compactify along the lines described above ) .",
    "my last remark concerns the form of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) .",
    "one might consider the euclidean solutions as physical ( i.e. classical ) ones ( and not just tools to integrate ( [ wdw ] ) or to evaluate a path integral ) .",
    "in other words , a physical signature change would actually be a thing to happen . in this case",
    ", it is worth noting that the mixed trajectories extremize the action @xmath103 , obtained from ( [ s ] ) after replacing @xmath57 by its absolute value @xmath104 . to",
    "what extent they represent physical solutions is not totally clear , because the question which junction conditions should apply at the surface of signature change is still a bit open @xcite . in any case , the  classical signature change ",
    "approach favours weaker conditions ( continuity of the extrinsic curvature instead of vanishing ) , and the mixed trajectories i described are likely to be accepted as classically sensible solutions .",
    "clearly , such an approach alters the standard foundations of quantum gravity . following the spirit of my speculations , one would modify the wheeler - dewitt equation accordingly , and thus arrive at @xmath105 instead of ( [ wdw ] ) . expressed briefly , treating signature change as a classical effect",
    ", the substitution @xmath51 in the euclidean hamiltonian @xmath106 leads to an equation like ( [ wdw ] ) but with @xmath107 replaced . in contrast ,",
    "the usual quantum cosmology approach amounts to perform the euclideanized substitution @xmath108 in @xmath109 , which leads back to ( [ wdw ] ) .",
    "the statement that the use of either lorentzian or euclidean geometries makes no difference in deriving the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite is only true if the latter are of no classical significance . postulating euclidean",
    "signature in the  quantum domain  of minisuperspace ( which may well be a ",
    "classical  domain in this context , especially if @xmath110 ) , leaves the zero - potential curve as the set of points where signature change _ may _ happen .",
    "assuming further that it _ does _ happen there , one arrives at ( [ wdwmod ] ) .",
    "a modified wheeler - dewitt equation as in ( [ wdwmod ] ) is exactly what has been proposed recently by martin @xcite . in his paper ,",
    "martin also shows ( in a frw plus scalar field minisuperspace model ) that the modified wheeler - dewitt equation allows less physically sensible boundary conditions than the standard one .",
    "if such an approach turns out to be fruitful for quantum cosmology , the speculations made here would turn out to be much less speculative than in the usual context , but would simply be a heuristic description of a particular candidate semiclassical state @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "maybe the following ( very last ) speculation is true : states built around mixed trajectories appear in the standard cosmological approach as highly peaked in the @xmath113 region of superspace , whereas in the classical signature change picture they emerge as oscillating wave functions .",
