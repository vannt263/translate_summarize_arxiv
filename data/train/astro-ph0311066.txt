    "when the existence of solid particles in interstellar space was first convincingly demonstrated by trumpler ( 1930 ) through the discovery of color excess between the photographic ( with an effective wavelength @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 ) and visual ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath5 ) magnitudes , the grains were estimated to be @xmath6@xmath7 , corresponding to radii of @xmath6@xmath8 ( trumpler 1930 ) . by the end of the 1930s ,",
    "a @xmath9 extinction law ( i.e. , the interstellar extinction varied approximately inversely with wavelength @xmath10 ) in the wavelength range 13@xmath11 had been well established ( hall 1937 ; stebbins , huffer , & whitford 1939 ) . at that time",
    ", metallic grains with a dominant size of @xmath120.05@xmath0 ( schaln 1936 ) or a power - law size distribution @xmath13@xmath12@xmath14 in the size range @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath16@xmath18 ( greenstein 1938 ) were proposed to explain the @xmath9 extinction law , partly because meteoritic particles ( predominantly metallic ) and interstellar grains were then thought to have the same origin . in view of",
    "the spatial correlation between gas concentration and dust extinction , lindblad ( 1935 ) suggested that interstellar grains were formed by condensation from the interstellar gas through random accretion of gas atoms .",
    "however , it was found later that in typical interstellar conditions , the lindblad condensation theory would result in a complete disappearance of all condensable gases and the grains would grow to sizes ( @xmath1210@xmath0 ) well beyond those which would account for the interstellar extinction ( see oort & van de hulst 1946 and references therein ) . by introducing a grain destruction process caused by grain - grain collisions as a consequence of interstellar cloud encounters , oort & van de hulst ( 1946 ) further developed the interstellar condensation idea and led to the `` dirty ice '' model consisting of saturated molecules such as h@xmath19o , ch@xmath20 , and nh@xmath21 with an equilibrium size distribution which could be roughly approximated by a functional form @xmath22@xmath12@xmath23 $ ] and an average size of @xmath120.15@xmath0 .",
    "the discovery of interstellar polarization ( hall 1949 ; hiltner 1949 ) cast doubts on the `` dirty ice '' model since ice grains are very inefficient polarizers .",
    "this stimulated cayrel & schatzman ( 1954 ) to consider graphite grains as an interstellar dust component since aligned graphite particles would be a very efficient interstellar polarizer because of their strong optical anisotropy .",
    "the `` dirty ice '' model was also challenged by nondetection of the 3.1@xmath0 feature of h@xmath19o ice outside of molecular clouds ( danielson , woolf , & gaustad 1965 ; knacke , cudaback , & gaustad 1969 ) .",
    "this gave the late j. mayo greenberg ( 19222001 ) the incentive to perform the early experiments on the ultraviolet ( uv ) photoprocessing of low temperature mixtures of volatile molecules simulating the `` original '' dirty ice grains ( greenberg et al .",
    "1972 ) to understand how and why the predicted h@xmath19o was not clearly present . from such experiments was predicted a new component of interstellar dust in the form of complex organics known as `` organic refractories '' , containing a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic carbonaceous molecules ( greenberg et al .",
    "2000 ) .    as an alternative to the interstellar condensation process",
    ", hoyle & wickramasinghe ( 1962 ) proposed that graphite particles with radii a few times 0.01@xmath0 could form in the atmospheres of cool n - type carbon stars , and subsequently be ejected into interstellar space by the stellar radiation pressure , and be responsible for ( part of ) the interstellar extinction and polarization .",
    "the graphite proposal further gained its strength from the prominent 2175@xmath24 interstellar extinction hump detected by the _",
    "aerobee _ rocket observation ( stecher 1965 ) , which was generally attributed to small graphitic grains ( stecher & donn 1965 ) ,",
    "although its exact nature still remains unidentified ( draine 1989 , 2003a ) .",
    "similarly , kamijo ( 1963 ) first proposed that sio@xmath19 whose size is of the order of @xmath1220@xmath24 , condensed in the atmospheres of cool m - type stars and expelled into interstellar space , could serve as condensation nuclei for the formation of `` dirty ices '' .",
    "it was later shown by gilman ( 1969 ) that grains around oxygen - rich cool giants are mainly silicates such as al@xmath19sio@xmath21 and mg@xmath19sio@xmath20 .",
    "interstellar silicates were first detected in emission in the trapezium region of the orion nebula ( stein & gillett 1969 ) ; in absorption toward the galactic center ( hackwell , gehrz , & woolf 1970 ) , and toward the becklin - neugebauer object and the kleinmann - low nebula ( gillett & forrest 1973 ) .",
    "silicates are now known to be an ubiquitous interstellar dust component ( see  1 in li & draine 2001a for a review ) .    in the 1960s and early 1970s ,",
    "the extension of the extinction curve toward the middle and far uv ( @xmath10@xmath6@xmath25 ) was made possible by rocket and satellite observations , including the rocket - based photoelectric photometry at @xmath26 and 2200@xmath24 ( boggess & borgman 1964 ) ; the _ aerobee _ rocket spectrophotometry at 1200@xmath24@xmath16@xmath10@xmath163000@xmath24 ( stecher 1965 ) ; the _ orbiting astronomical satellite _ ( oao-2 ) spectrophotometry at 1100@xmath24@xmath16@xmath10@xmath16@xmath27 ( bless & savage 1972 ) ; and the _ copernicus _ satellite spectrophotometry at 1000@xmath24@xmath16@xmath10@xmath16@xmath28 ( york et al .  1973 ) . by 1973",
    ", the interstellar extinction curve had been determined over the whole wavelength range from 0.2@xmath11 to 10@xmath11 .",
    "the fact that the extinction continues to increase in the far uv ( e.g. , see york et al",
    ".  1973 ) implies that no single grain type with either a single size or a continuous size distribution could account for the observed optical to far - uv interstellar extinction ( greenberg 1973 ) .",
    "this led to the abandonment of any one - component grain models and stimulated the emergence of various kinds of models consisting of multiple dust constituents , including silicate , silicon carbide , iron , iron oxide , graphite , dirty ice , solid h@xmath19 , etc . + in 1956 platt first suggested that very small grains or large molecules of less than 10@xmath24 in radius grown by random accretion from the interstellar gas could be responsible for the observed interstellar extinction and polarization .",
    "platt ( 1956 ) postulated these `` platt '' particles as quantum - mechanical particles containing many ions and free radicals with unfilled electronic energy bands .",
    "donn ( 1968 ) further proposed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon - like `` platt particles '' may be responsible for the uv interstellar extinction .",
    "greenberg ( 1968 ) first pointed out that very small grains with a heat content smaller than or comparable to the energy of a single stellar photon , can not be characterized by a steady - state temperature but rather are subject to substantial temporal fluctuations in temperature . under interstellar conditions",
    ", grains larger than a few hundred angstroms in radius would attain an equilibrium temperature in the range of 1525@xmath29 ( greenberg 1968 , 1971 ; mathis , mezger , & panagia 1983 ; draine & lee 1984 ; li & draine 2001b ) .",
    "this temperature was long thought to be @xmath123@xmath29 before van de hulst ( 1949 ) made the first realistic estimation of 1020@xmath29 for both metallic and dielectric grains .    in a study of the scattering properties of interstellar dust ( albedo and phase function ) determined from the oao-2 observations at 1500@xmath24@xmath16@xmath10@xmath16@xmath30 of the diffuse galactic light ( witt & lillie 1973 ) , witt ( 1973 )",
    "first explicitly suggested a bi - modal size distribution for interstellar grains : large grains with radii @xmath6@xmath31 would provide extinction in the visible region including scattering which is strongly forward directed , and small particles with radii @xmath16@xmath32 would dominate the uv region and contribute nearly isotopic scattering .",
    "the presence of `` platt '' particles in a dust cloud near m17 was first suggested by andriesse ( 1978 ) based on an analysis of its ir spectral energy distribution which was shown to be characterized by a combination of widely different color temperatures ( e.g. , the far - ir and near - ir color temperatures are @xmath1238@xmath29 and @xmath12150@xmath29 , respectively ) and that the 820@xmath0 emission spectrum is similar over a distance of @xmath122@xmath33 through the source .",
    "andriesse ( 1978 ) argued that the color temperature differences can not be easily ascribed to a spatial variation of the dust temperature in this cloud , because the cloud profile appears to be independent of the wavelength ; instead , `` platt '' particles with sizes of @xmath1210@xmath24 exhibiting temperature fluctuations up to @xmath12150@xmath29 plus large grains with an equilibrium temperature of @xmath1236@xmath29 can explain the observed ir spectrum of m17 .    in a near - ir ( 1.254.8@xmath0 )",
    "photometric and spectrophotometric study of three visual reflection nebulae ngc 7023 , 2023 , and 2068 , sellgren , werner , & dinerstein ( 1983 ) discovered that each nebula has extended near - ir emission consisting of emission features at 3.3 and 3.4@xmath0 and a smooth continuum which can be described by a greybody with a color temperature @xmath121000@xmath29 .",
    "they found that the emission spectrum ( i.e. , the color temperature for the continuum and the 3.3@xmath0 feature ) shows very little variation from source to source and within a given source with distance from the central star .",
    "sellgren ( 1984 ) argued that this emission could not be explained by thermal emission from dust in radiative equilibrium with the central star since otherwise the color temperature of this emission should fall off rapidly with distance from the illuminating star ; instead , she proposed that this emission is emitted by ultrasmall grains , @xmath1210@xmath24 in radius , which undergo large excursions in temperature due to stochastic heating by single stellar photons .",
    "the presence of a population of ultrasmall grains in the diffuse ism was explicitly indicated by the 12@xmath0 and 25@xmath0 `` cirrus '' emission detected by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) ( boulanger & prault 1988 ) , which is far in excess ( by several orders of magnitude ) of what would be expected from large grains of 1525@xmath29 in thermal equilibrium with the general interstellar radiation field .",
    "subsequent measurements by the _ diffuse infrared background experiment _ ( dirbe ) instrument on the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( cobe ) satellite confirmed this and detected additional broadband emission at 3.5@xmath0 and 4.9@xmath0 ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "more recently , spectrometers aboard the _ infrared telescope in space _ ( irts ) ( onaka et al .",
    "1996 ; tanaka et al .",
    "1996 ) and the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) ( mattila et al .  1996 ) have shown that the diffuse ism radiates strongly in emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath0 .",
    "these emission features , first seen in the spectra of the planetary nebulae ngc 7027 and bd+30@xmath343639 ( gillett , forrest , & merrill 1973 ) , have been observed in a wide range of astronomical environments including planetary nebulae , protoplanetary nebulae , reflection nebulae , hii regions , circumstellar envelopes , and external galaxies ( see tielens et al .",
    "2000 for a review )",
    ". often referred to as `` unidentified infrared '' ( uir ) bands , these emission features are now usually attributed to free - flying pah molecules which are vibrationally excited upon absorption of a single uv / visible photon ( lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola , tielens , & barker 1985 ; allamandola , hudgins , & sandford 1999 ; draine & li 2001 ; li & draine 2001b ) although other carriers have also been proposed such as carbonaceous grains with a partly aromatic character ( e.g. , hac [ duley & williams 1981 , duley , jones , & williams 1990 ] , quenched carbonaceous composite [ qcc ; sakata et al .",
    "1992 ] , coal [ papoular et al .  1996 ] , fullerenes [ c@xmath35 ; webster 1993 ] ) , and surface - graphitized nanodiamonds ( jones & dhendecourt 2000 ) .    since the late 1970s ,",
    "various modern interstellar dust models have been developed ( see li & greenberg 2003 , draine 2004 , dwek et al .",
    "2004 for recent reviews ) . in general",
    ", these models fall into three broad categories :    *  this model consists of two ( physically ) separate dust components each with a power - law size distribution @xmath36 in the size range @xmath37@xmath16@xmath17@xmath16@xmath38 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 [ hereafter mrn ] ; draine & lee 1984 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) , and zubko , dwek , & arendt ( 2003 ) by including new dust components ( e.g. , amorphous carbon , carbonaceous organic refractory , and pahs ) and adjusting dust sizes ( e.g. , deriving dust size distributions using the `` maximum entropy method '' or the `` method of regularization '' rather than presuming a certain functional form ) .",
    "+ recent developments were made by draine and his coworkers ( li & draine 2001b , 2002a , 2002b ; weingartner & draine 2001a ) who have extended the silicate - graphite grain model to explicitly include a pah component as the small - size end of the carbonaceous grain population .",
    "the pah component , containing @xmath39 of c relative to h , is represented by a log - normal size distribution @xmath40 ^ 2/           \\left(2\\sigma^2\\right)\\right\\}$ ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath17@xmath6@xmath43 ( see li & draine 2001b ) .",
    "note that with the pah component added , the size distribution of the larger grains is changed from the simple mrn power - law ( see weingartner & draine 2001a ; zubko et al .",
    "*  originally proposed by greenberg ( 1978 ) in the context of a complex cyclic evolutionary scenario ( see greenberg & li 1999 ) , this model consists of larger silicate grains coated by a layer of carbonaceous organic refractory material , produced by uv photolysis of ice mixtures which attempts to simulate the physical and chemical processes occurring in interstellar space .",
    "the most recent development of this model was that of li & greenberg ( 1997 ) , who modeled the core - mantle grains as 2:1 ( the ratio of the length to the diameter ) finite cylinders ( to account for the interstellar polarization ) with a gaussian size distribution for the mantle @xmath44 $ ] and a single silicate core radius @xmath45@xmath3@xmath46 and a `` cut - off '' size @xmath47@xmath3@xmath48 .",

    "( 1989 ) postulated that an absorbed stellar photon might remain localized in a single aromatic unit of the grain long enough for the unit to cool by ir vibrational relaxation rather than by transferring the photon energy to the phonon spectrum of the grain . *",
    " realizing that grain shattering due to grain - grain collisions and subsequent reassembly through agglomeration of grain fragments may be important in the ism , mathis & whiffen ( 1989 ) modeled the interstellar grains as composite collections of small silicates , vacuum ( @xmath51 in volume ) , and carbon of various kinds ( amorphous carbon , hac , organic refractories ) with a power - law size distribution @xmath13@xmath12@xmath52 in the size range @xmath53@xmath16@xmath17@xmath16@xmath54 .",
    "in addition , a separate small graphite component containing @xmath55 of c is needed to account for the 2175@xmath24 extinction hump .",
    "wright ( 1987 ) argued that a fractal structure would be expected for interstellar grains formed through the coagulation of small grain fragments created from grain disruption caused by supernova shock waves . in view that the relative abundances of refractory elements in the ism may be as low as 65% of solar ( snow & witt 1996 ) , mathis ( 1996 ) revised the composite model in order to satisfy the tighter abundance constraints . to optimize",

    "( 2003 ) by including a population of pah molecules .",
    "it is fair to say that , as can be seen from the above summarizing description of the key contemporary dust models , a consensus on the interstellar dust compositions and sizes is now approaching among various grain models , although the debate in details is still going on and is not expected to disappear in the near future ( except that the ir spectropolarimetric observation at 3.4@xmath0 and 9.7@xmath0 may allow a direct test of the core - mantle model for interstellar dust ; see li & greenberg 2002 )     * regarding the grain chemical composition , the most generally accepted view is that interstellar grains consist of amorphous silicates and some form of carbonaceous materials ; the former is inferred from the 9.7@xmath0 si  o stretching mode and 18@xmath0 o - si - o bending mode absorption features in interstellar regions as well as the fact that the cosmically abundant heavy elements such as si , fe , mg are highly depleted ; the latter is mainly inferred from the 2175@xmath24 extinction hump ( and the ubiquitous 3.4@xmath0 c  h stretching vibrational band ) and the fact that silicates alone are not able to provide enough extinction . for the carbonaceous component , a wide range of dust materials have been suggested including amorphous carbon , coal , c@xmath35 , diamond , graphite , hac , pahs , organic refractory , and qcc ( see pendleton 2004 for a review of the carbonaceous component ) . *",
    "it is also generally accepted that , through the analysis of the wavelength - dependent interstellar extinction and polarization curves as well as the near and mid ir emission , interstellar grain sizes may be separated into two domains  ( 1 ) the `` large '' grain component ( with radii @xmath17@xmath56@xmath57 ; including the `` classical '' grains [ with @xmath17@xmath6@xmath58 ) which is primarily responsible for the extinction , polarization and scattering at visible wavelengths and the ir emission at @xmath10@xmath6@xmath59 ; and ( 2 ) the `` very small grain '' component ( with @xmath17@xmath60@xmath57 ) which contributes importantly to the extinction in the vacuum - uv and emit strongly in the near and mid ir at @xmath10@xmath16@xmath59 ( see figs.8,16 of li & draine 2001b ) when transiently heated to high temperatures during quantized absorption events . + while the size distribution for the `` classical grain '' component is relatively well constrained by fitting the observed interstellar extinction curve for an assumed dust composition , our knowledge of the size distribution @xmath61 for the `` very small grain '' component is better constrained by the interstellar near and mid ir emission due to the fact that , for @xmath10@xmath6@xmath62 , these very small grains are in the rayleigh limit ( @xmath63@xmath641 ) and their extinction cross sections @xmath65 per unit volume @xmath66 are independent of size , so that the observed uv / far - uv extinction curve @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) only constrains the total volume @xmath69 of this grain component : @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the hydrogen column density . in contrast , the near and mid ir intensity @xmath72 is sensitive to the grain heat capacity ( @xmath73@xmath74 ) which determines the maximum temperature to which the grain can reach when illuminated by a radiation field : @xmath75)\\left(dp / dt\\right)dt$ ] where @xmath76 is the absorption cross section for a grain of radius @xmath17 at wavelength @xmath10 ( for grains in the rayleigh limit , @xmath77@xmath3@xmath78 ) , @xmath79 is the planck function , @xmath80 is the dust temperature distribution function . evidently , @xmath80 is a sensitive function of grain size @xmath17 ( see draine & li 2001 , li & draine 2001b ; and  3 , fig.6 of this paper ) .    in the following sections of this review , we will focus on the ultrasmall grain component ( @xmath17@xmath16@xmath81 ) , with particular emphasis on the photophysical processes including the stochastic heating and the vibrational excitation of pah molecules , and the excitation of the photoluminescence of silicon nanoparticles . in astrophysical literature",
    ", one frequently encounters terms like `` ultrasmall grains '' , `` very small grains '' , `` large molecules '' , `` tiny grains '' , and `` nanoparticles '' ; to avoid confusion , we emphasize here that they are synonymous . in the following",
    "we will use the term `` nanoparticles ''  by `` nanoparticles '' we mean grains of a few angstroms to a few tens of nanometers in radius .    in  2",
    "we summarize the direct and indirect evidence for the existence of nanoparticles in the ism .",

    "the discovery of presolar nanodiamonds ( see  5.4 ) and tic nanocrystals ( see  5.5 ) in primitive meteorites implies that there must exist such nano - sized species in interstellar space .",

    "this emission , accounting for @xmath1220% of the total power radiated by dust , is closely explained by transiently heated pahs with an abundance @xmath82@xmath345 parts per million ( ppm ) and a log - normal size distribution peaking at @xmath126@xmath24 ( with @xmath12100 carbon atoms ; see li & draine 2001b for details ) . *",

    "the far - uv interstellar extinction continues to rise up to @xmath86 , and there does not appear to be any evidence of saturation even at this wavelength ( see whittet 2003 ) .",
    "since it is generally true that a grain absorbs and scatters light most effectively at wavelengths comparable to its size @xmath87 ( krgel 2003 ) , we can therefore conclude that there must be appreciable numbers of interstellar grains with @xmath17@xmath16@xmath88@xmath3@xmath89 ( e.g. , in the size distribution derived by weingartner & draine [ 2001a ] , grains smaller than 2@xmath90 provides @xmath51 of the total surface area , although they contain only @xmath91 of the total dust mass ) .",

    "however , the dust thermal emission at microwave frequencies extrapolated from the 1003000@xmath0 far - ir emission radiated by large grains in thermal equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field falls far below the observed microwave emission ( draine 1999 ) .",
    "this `` anomalous '' emission also significantly exceeds the free - free emission from interstellar plasma ( draine & lazarian 1998a ) .",
    "as described by draine and his coworkers ( draine & lazarian 1998b ; draine & li 2003 ) , a number of physical processes , including collisions with neutral atoms and ions , `` plasma drag '' ( due to interaction of the electric dipole moment of the grain with the electric field produced by passing ions ) , and absorption and emission of photons , can drive nanoparticles to rapidly rotate , with rotation rates reaching tens of ghz .",
    "the rotational electric dipole emission from these spinning nanoparticles , the very same grain component required to account for the `` uir '' emission and the iras 12 and 25@xmath0 emission , was shown to be capable of accounting for the `` anomalous '' microwave emission ( draine & lazarian 1998a , b ; draine 1999 ) .",
    "* grains are long thought to be an important energy source for the interstellar gas through ejection of photoelectrons since ( a ) photons with energies below the ionization potential of h ( @xmath1213.6@xmath92 ) do not couple directly to the gas ; and ( b ) other heating sources such as cosmic rays , magnetic fields , and turbulence are unimportant as a global heating source for the diffuse ism .",
    "+ the photoelectric heating starts from the absorption of a far - uv photon by a dust grain , followed by ejection of an electron which then collisionally heats the interstellar gas by transferring ( to the gas ) the excess energy left over after overcoming the work function ( the binding energy of the electron to the grain ) and the electrostatic potential of the grain ( if it is charged ) .",
    "+ in the diffuse ism , nanoparticles ( and in particular , angstrom - sized pah molecules ) are much more efficient in heating the gas than large grains ( see tielens & peeters 2002 and references therein ) since ( a ) the mean free path of an electron in a solid is just @xmath1210@xmath24 and therefore photoelectrons created inside a large grain rarely reach the grain surface ; and ( b ) the total far - uv absorption is dominated by the nanoparticle component .",
    "recent studies show that grains smaller than @xmath93 are responsible for @xmath94 of the total photoelectric heating of the gas , with half of this provided by grains smaller than 15@xmath24 ( bakes & tielens 1994 ; weingartner & draine 2001b ) .",

    "this suggests that the ere carriers are very likely in the nanometer size range because ( a ) in general , nanoparticles are expected to luminesce efficiently through the recombination of the electron - hole pair created upon absorption of an energetic photon , since in such small systems the excited electron is spatially confined and the radiationless transitions that are facilitated by auger and defect related recombination are reduced ( see  4 ) ; and ( b ) small nanoparticles may be photolytically more unstable and/or more readily photoionized in regions where the radiation intensity exceeds certain levels of intensity and hardness , and thus resulting in both a decrease in the ere intensity and a redshift of the ere peak wavelength , since ( i ) photoionization would quench the luminescence of nanoparticles , and ( ii ) the smaller grains would be selectively removed due to size - dependent photofragmentation ( smith & witt 2002 ) .",

    "therefore , it is reasonable to model the stochastic heating of a nanoparticle in terms of pure vibrational transitions",

    "just like the photon _ absorption _ process discussed above , the electron - hole recombination in a direct band gap material does not involve any phonons since there is no need for momentum change for the electron .",
    "in contrast , in an indirect gap material , the excited electron located in the conduction band needs to undergo a change in momentum state before it can recombine with a hole in the valence band ; conservation of momentum demands that the electron - hole recombination must be accompanied by the emission of a phonon , since it is not possible to make this recombination by the emission of a photon alone .",
    "compared to the photon _ absorption _ process in an indirect gap material for which conservation of momentum can be fulfilled by either absorption or emission of a phonon , in the electron - hole _ recombination _",
    "process phonon absorption becomes negligible , whereas phonon emission becomes the dominant momentum conservation mediator because ( 1 ) the number of phonons available for absorption is small and is rapidly decreasing at lower temperatures , whereas the emission of phonons by electrons which are already at a high - energy state is very probable ; and ( 2 ) an optical transition assisted by phonon emission occurs at a lower photon energy @xmath252 than the gap energy , whereas phonon absorption results in a higher photon energy of at least @xmath253 , which can be more readily re - absorbed by the semiconductor nanoparticle .",
    "but we note that the energy of a phonon ( @xmath254 ) is just in the order of @xmath12@xmath255 , much smaller than the energy of the electron - hole recombination luminescence photon . also because prior to the recombination",
    ", the electrons and holes respectively accumulate at the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band , the energy separation between the electrons and the holes approximately equals to the energy of the band gap .",
    "therefore , the luminescence emitted by both types of semiconductors occurs at an energy close to the band gap @xmath230 .",
    "the pl efficiency is determined by the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination . for an indirect gap material , the pl process , which requires a change in both energy and momentum for the excited electron and hence involves",
    "both a photon and a phonon , is a second - order process with a long radiative lifetime ( @xmath12@xmath256 ) , and therefore a relatively small efficiency because of the competition with nonradiative combination .",
    "in contrast , in a direct gap material , the emission of a pl photon does not need the assistance of a phonon to conserve momentum .",
    "therefore , the pl process in a direct gap material is a first - order process with a much shorter radiative lifetime ( @xmath12@xmath257 ) and a much higher pl efficiency in comparison with an indirect gap material .",
    "however , for particles in the nanometer size domain , we would expect substantial changes in both the efficiency and the peak energy of the photoluminescence due to the quantum confinement effect .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the heisenberg uncertainty principle . unlike in bulk materials the electrons and holes",
    "are free to move within their respective bands in all three directions , in nanoparticles the electrons and holes are spatially confined and hence their motion is quantized in all three dimensions .",
    "the spatial confinement of a particle of mass @xmath258 to a region in a given direction ( say , along the @xmath259 axis ) of length @xmath260 would introduce an uncertainty in its momentum @xmath261 and increase its kinetic energy by an amount @xmath262 .",
    "a simple particle - in - a - box analysis , using the schrdinger s equation and the effective mass approximation , shows that the ground state quantum confinement energy would be @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the reduced effective mass of the electron - hole pair ( @xmath265 and @xmath266 are respectively the effective mass of the electron and hole ) ( fox 2001 ) . for nano - sized particles ,",
    "the quantum confinement effect becomes significant since the confinement energy @xmath267 would be comparable to or greater than their thermal energy @xmath268 at the temperature range expected for nanoparticles in the diffuse ism ( see figs.7,8 of draine & li 2001 and fig.3 of li & draine 2002a ) .",
    "for example , a silicon grain with @xmath269 and @xmath270 ( @xmath271 is the free electron mass ) smaller than @xmath128@xmath90 would exhibit quantum effects at a temperature @xmath217@xmath12100@xmath29 ( which is expected for nano - sized silicon dust in the diffuse ism ; see fig.3 of li & draine 2002a ) with @xmath272 .",
    "more detailed studies show that silicon nanocrystals exhibit an @xmath273 gap - size dependence : @xmath274 , where @xmath275 is the bulk silicon band gap ( delerue , allan , & lannoo 1993 ) . for nanodiamonds ,",
    "an @xmath276 gap - size dependence was derived from the x - ray absorption spectrum measurements ( chang et al .",
    "1999 ; also see raty et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath277 , where @xmath278 is the bulk diamond band gap .",
    "it is apparent , therefore , the quantum confinement effect would lead to a progressive widening of the band gap of a nano - sized semiconductor as its size is reduced , along with a broadening of the electron - hole pair state in momentum space ( i.e. an increased overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions ) , and a decreasing probability for the pair to find a nonradiative recombination center , provided that the surface dangling bonds are passivated which would otherwise act as traps for the carriers and quench the pl .",
    "while the former would shift the pl peak to higher energies , the latter two effects would greatly enhance the electron - hole radiative recombination probability and result in a higher pl efficiency .",
