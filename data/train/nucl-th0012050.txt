    "in the early 1960 s single j shell calculations in the f@xmath10 region were performed by mccullen , bayman , and zamick ( mbz ) [ 1,2 ] and ginocchio and french[3 ] . in these calculations",
    "the two body matrix elements were taken from experiment .",
    "however the t=0 neutron proton spectrum in @xmath11sc was not well determined .",
    "calculations with correct t=0 matrix elements were later performed by kutschera , brown , and ogawa[4 ] .    in order to see how neutron - proton two body matrix elements with isospin t=0 affect the low lying spectra of nuclei , we have set them to a constant in a single j shell calculation in the f@xmath10 region .",
    "we can then write @xmath12 where c is a constant . hence @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the spectrum of states of a given isospin e.g. t=0 in @xmath7ti is independent of what the constant is , it might as well be",
    ". what the constant is will affect only the energy splittings of states with different isospin .",
    "we shall denote this matrix element input as @xmath0 .",
    "although setting all t=0 matrix elements to a constant may seem like a severe approximation , it will be seen that one gets a fairly good representation of the spectrum .",
    "when the t=0 matrix elements are reintroduced , there is some fine tuning which improves the spectrum .",
    "while the problem of t=1 pairing is better understood and studied , there exists a very extensive literature on the possibility of t=0 pairing , both pro and con .",
    "we here include some of the relevant references.[5 - 13 ]    in a shell model calculation the effects of both t=0 and t=1 pairing are automatically included .",
    "the problem then is to sort out as much as possible the individual effects .    in the next sections we will consider calculations in the f@xmath10 shell and in the full fp space",
    "in the following tables we show t = t@xmath14 calculated yrast spectra for @xmath3ti(table i ) and @xmath7ti(table ii ) where we use 2 different sets of matrix elements . in the first two columns we show @xmath0 for the @xmath11sc matrix elements . the last two columns consists of matrix elements from @xmath11sc with the t=0 matrix elements now included . also to gain some insight into how configuration mixing affects our results , we present full fp space results for @xmath3ti and @xmath7ti in tables iii and iv respectively .    in the single j shell calculation for which the matrix elements were taken from the spectrum of @xmath11sc the values of these matrix elements for j = 0 to j=7 were 0.000 mev , 0.6110 mev , 1.5863 mev , 1.4904 mev , 2.8153 mev , 1.5101 mev , 3.242 mev , and 0.6163 mev respectively . the yrast spectrum is also shown in fig 1 .",
    "note that with a j@xmath15 configuration the even j states have t equal to one and the odd j t equal to zero .",
    "this is also true experimentally for these levels .",
    "note that the j=1@xmath16 and 7@xmath16 are nearly degenerate near 0.6 mev and the j=3@xmath16 and 5@xmath16 are nearly degenerate near 1.5 mev .",
    "thus the act of setting t=0 matrix elements to a constant is equivalent to moving the j=1@xmath16 and 7@xmath16 together up about 0.9 mev . or putting it another way , the act of removing the degeneracy is to lower the energies of the j=1@xmath16 and 7@xmath16 by about the same amount .",
    "this is in contrast to most studies in which only the effects of lowering the j=1@xmath16 state are studied",
    ".    we will point out several features to be found in the tables .",
    "we observe many levels that were considerably separated in the normal interaction become degenerate when we go to @xmath0 .",
    "we explore this further in the next section .",
    "we find that in general with few exceptions that the odd i levels of @xmath7ti are at a lower excitation energy when we go to the @xmath0 version of the interactions and that the @xmath3ti spectra is lowered in total .",
    "as can be seen from tables i and ii some energy levels are degenerate when the t=0 matrix elements are set equal to a constant .",
    "the degenerate pairs @xmath17 include        the wavefunctions for the titanium isotopes are written as @xmath20^{i \\alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the probability amplitude that in a state of total angular momentum i the protons couple to @xmath22 and the neutrons to @xmath23 .",
    "the elements @xmath24 form a column vector .",
    "let us first consider @xmath25 in @xmath3ti .",
    "the basis states can be written as @xmath26^{i}$ ] where @xmath22 is the angular momentum of the two protons . the interaction matrix element @xmath27^{i}v[j_{p},j_{n}]^{i } > = \\delta _ { j_{p}^{\\prime},j_{p}}e_{j_{p}}+2 \\sigma_{j } u(jjij , j_{p}^{\\prime}j ) u(jjij , j_{p}j)e_{j}$ ] where @xmath28 is the two particle matrix element @xmath29^{j}v[jj]^{j}>$ ] .",
    "for even j , t is equal to one while for odd j , t is equal to zero .",
    "we next consider @xmath7ti the interaction matrix element @xmath30^{i}v[j_{p}j_{n}]^{i}>$ ] is given by @xmath31 where the unitary recouping coefficients are related to the wigner 9j symbols @xmath32 for symmetry relations the 9j symbols are more convenient than the unitary coefficients .",
