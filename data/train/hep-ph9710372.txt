    "with the discovery of the top quark by the cdf and d@xmath9 collaborations @xcite , it has become natural to consider its properties , such as its couplings to the other particles of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the top quark is singled out by its large mass ( @xmath10 175 gev ) , the same order as the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale , @xmath11 gev .",
    "thus it seems reasonable that the top may prove valuable in probing the mechanism of mass generation in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "indeed , if there is some type of new physics associated with the generation of mass , it may be more apparent in the top quark sector than for any of the other , lighter , known fermions , in accordance with the mass hierarchy .    while production of @xmath12 pairs @xcite provides an excellent opportunity to probe the top s qcd properties , in order to carefully measure the top s electro - weak interactions it is also useful to consider single top production , in addition to studying the decay of the top quark in @xmath13 events .",
    "single top production at the tevatron occurs within the sm in three different channels , the @xmath4-channel @xmath5 production , @xmath14 @xcite , the @xmath2-channel @xmath3-exchange mode , @xmath15 @xcite ( sometimes referred to as @xmath3-gluon fusion ) , and through @xmath16 production @xcite .",
    "these three sub - processes have very different kinematics and experimental signatures @xcite , and as we shall discuss later , are sensitive to different types of new physics in the top quark sector .",
    "thus they provide complimentary information about the properties of the top quark .    in this paper",
    ", we quantify the observation that the modes of single top production can be used to provide complimentary information about the top quark . in section [ singlet ]",
    ", we discuss the properties of these separate modes of single top production in the context of the sm , summarizing the positive and negative aspects of each for probing the top quark sector at the tevatron run ii collider . at run",
    "ii it is expected that a center - of - mass energy @xmath1 tev for the colliding protons and anti - protons will be realized . for the purposes of this study ,",
    "we consider a data sample with an integrated luminosity of @xmath17 , and 30 . ] . in section  [ resonance ]",
    "we show the effect of an additional heavy resonance on each sub - process , and in section [ width ] we examine the effects from possible modifications to the top s couplings to the other particles of the sm .",
    "finally , we examine what the possibility of new physics in the top quark sector implies about our ability to measure @xmath7 with confidence .",
    "single top production at a hadron collider occurs dominantly through three sub - processes .",
    "the @xmath5 mode of production shown in figure [ schannelfig ] occurs when a quark and an anti - quark fuse into a virtual @xmath3 boson , which then splits into a @xmath2 and @xmath18 quark .",
    "the @xmath3-gluon fusion mode shown in figure [ tchannelfig ] , occurs when a @xmath19 quark fuses with a @xmath20 boson , producing a top quark .",
    "the @xmath21 mode occurs when a @xmath19 quark radiates a @xmath22 , and is shown in figure [ twfig ] .",
    "this mode may be important at the large hadron collider collider with @xmath23 14 tev . ]",
    "( lhc ) , but is highly suppressed at the tevatron because of the massive @xmath3 and @xmath2 particles in the final state . because of its low cross section of about 0.1 pb ( for @xmath24 gev ) at the tevatron run ii @xcite , and relative insensitivity to the new physics effects we will be considering in this work , we do not present detailed studies of its cross section .",
    "the three single top production processes contain the vertex of the sm , and thus are sensitive to any possible modification of this vertex from physics beyond the sm , and to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) parameter @xmath7 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that because of the difference in kinematics , it is possible to statistically disentangle the two sub - processes from each other , and from the sm backgrounds expected at the tevatron run ii .    the total cross section for the @xmath5 production sub - process ( @xmath25 ) has been studied at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in qcd corrections ( order @xmath26 ) @xcite , by including nlo corrections to both the @xmath27 initial state ( c.f .",
    "figure [ nlosi ] ) and the @xmath28 final state ( c.f .",
    "figure [ nlosf ] ) .",
    "detailed studies for the kinematics of this process at leading order ( lo ) @xcite exist in the literature , as well as more realistic studies in which the effects of soft gluons on the kinematics have been re - summed @xcite .",
    "this sub - process is an attractive mode for studying top quark properties , because the initial state partons are quarks with relatively large momentum fraction , @xmath29 , and thus the parton densities are well understood . on the other hand , this mode suffers from a smaller cross section than the @xmath3-gluon fusion mode , and a larger percentage dependence on the mass of the top quark @xcite . in order to estimate the uncertainty in the nlo theoretical prediction for the @xmath5 production rate",
    ", we examine the dependence of the result on the factorization and renormalization scales ( which in principle are separate quantities , however we will work with @xmath30 ) , and the dependence on the choice of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) used . a physical observable",
    "can not depend on the scale @xmath31 , and a theoretical calculation to all orders in perturbation theory must similarly be independent of the value of @xmath31 used in the calculation .",
    "however , at fixed order in the perturbation series the theoretical prediction will still show some residual dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath31 , one obtains an estimate of the dependence of the calculation on the uncalculated , higher order terms in the perturbation series . in @xcite",
    "it was found that in order to cancel potentially large logarithms in the nlo perturbation coefficients , a scale choice of @xmath32 is appropriate , where @xmath33 is the center of mass energy of the incoming partons .",
    "thus we vary the scale between @xmath34 and @xmath35 in order to estimate the scale dependence of the calculation . to examine the pdf dependence of the result",
    ", we choose the cteq4 m @xcite and mrrs(r1 ) @xcite pdf .",
    "for each of various values of @xmath36 , we combine all of these predictions ( due to varied pdf and scale ) to determine the upper and lower bounds on @xmath25 for each top mass under consideration , by taking the combination of pdf and scale choice which gives the highest and lowest result respectively . in this way we can study the correlated effect obtained by varying the pdf and scale ( and @xmath36 ) .",
    "we also present the central value of @xmath25 , obtained as the point midway between the upper and lower bounds , and the mean , which is the average of the two pdf sets with the scale choice @xmath32 .",
    "the mean value represents the best theoretical estimate of @xmath25 .",
    "the fact that the mean and central values are the same for most of the top masses considered shows that the result does not depend more strongly on either raising or lowering the scale , and thus indicates that the choice of scale is appropriate .",
    "our results are presented in table [ schantab ] and are shown graphically in figure [ topmassdep ] .",
    "these results include the full ckm elements for the light quark fusion into @xmath5 , but do not include any ckm parameters in the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath19 vertex production and not @xmath37 or @xmath38 production , under the assumption that @xmath39 . ] .",
    "the numbers include the rate of both @xmath40 and @xmath41 production through the @xmath5 mode . if we define the variable , m_t m_t - 175 , we can parameterize the curves in table [ schantab ] ( in units of pb ) as follows , @xmath42",
    "-0.06 in    .the central and mean values of @xmath25 ( in pb ) , along with the upper and lower bounds derived by varying the scale and by considering the pdf sets cteq4 m and mrrs(r1 ) . the central value is the value midway between the upper and lower bounds , while the mean is the averaged result of @xmath25 calculated using the cteq4 m and mrrs(r1 ) pdf with the canonical scale choice discussed in the text .
