    "various far - from - equilibrium relations , such as the jarzynski relation @xcite or the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) @xcite , obtained for classical systems during the past decade , provide new insights into the emergence of irreversible processes in physical systems @xcite .",
    "these relations follow from the observation that the ratio of the probability of a system forward and time - reversed trajectory is given by the exponential of a quantity , the trajectory entropy production , which when ensemble averaged , gives the entropy production in the system .",
    "these relations therefore quantify the probabilities of observing `` non - thermodynamic '' trajectories with decreased trajectory entropy production .",
    "these probabilities are infinitesimally small in the macroscopic world but are non - negligible in microscopic systems . however , the ensemble averaged dynamics always satisfies the second law ( entropy production always grows ) .",
