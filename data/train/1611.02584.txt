    "given two non - void sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a map @xmath2 is called a  _ multifunction _ or a  _ set - valued function_. a ( single - valued ) function @xmath3 is a  _ selection _ for  @xmath4 , if @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "there is a plethora of results concerning selections of various kinds , with the micheal selection principle concerning lower semi - continuous selections and the kuratowski  ryll - nardzewski selection principle concerning measurable selections as probably the most prominent ones .",
    "more recent results connected with michael selection principle were established by zippin  @xcite .    when @xmath0 and @xmath1 carry a vector - space structure , it is natural to study affine selections or , at least local affine selections for multifunctions @xmath2 , which are the objective of this note .",
    "this topic was investigated ( among others ) by a.  lazar  @xcite , a.  smajdor and w. smajdor  @xcite , e.  behrends and k.  nikodem  @xcite , m.  balaj and k.  nikodem  @xcite and the present author ( _ cf . _",

    "indeed , if @xmath31 , where @xmath3 is affine , the above intersection is a  singleton @xmath32 .",
    "it is proved in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1 ) that the multifunction  @xmath4 mapping a  real interval  @xmath33 into the family of all compact intervals in  @xmath34 , admits an affine selection if and only if the condition   is satisfied . in particular ,",
    "if either @xmath4 is convex or concave , then  @xmath4 admits an affine selection .    one could ask whether a  convex multifunction defined on more general domain admits an affine selection .",
    "there is a  number of results going in this direction .",
    "one of the versions of the classical hahn  banach separation theorem guarantees the existence of the linear functional separating two convex subsets of a  topological vector space .",
    "it could be easily utilised to prove the existence of a  linear ( and hence afine ) selection of the certain convex multifunction .",
    "since the problem of extending functions is strongly related to the problem of the existence of selections of multifunctions , we notice that peczyski in his phd dissertation  @xcite dealt with linear versions of the classical tietze ",
    "urysohn theorem ( and extended further the classical borsuk  dugundji theorem ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that edwards  @xcite proved in 1965 the following separation theorem :    [ th : edwards ] let @xmath0 be a choquet simplex , @xmath35 a  convex upper semicontinuous function and let @xmath36 $ ] be a  concave lower semicontinuous function such that @xmath37 on @xmath0 .",
    "then there exists a  continuous affine function @xmath38  @xmath39 on  @xmath0 .",
    "this result , read in the context of multifunctions , states that the lower semicontinuous convex set - valued function defined on a  choquet simplex , whose values are compact intervals , admits a  continuous affine selection",
    ". this multivalued version of theorem  [ th : edwards ] was extended in 1968 by lazar ( _ cf .",

    "in fact , edwards proved his result in a  form of the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath0 to be a choquet simplex .",
    "this means that if a  convex set  @xmath0 is not a  simplex , one could find two functions @xmath44 ( as considered in theorem  [ th : edwards ] ) , which can not be separated by the continuous affine function .",
    "hence , in general , a  convex multifunction defined on a  convex subset of a  vector space need not to admit the affine selection .",
    "let us have a look at the well known example due to olsen  @xcite ( see also nikodem  ( * ? ? ? *",
