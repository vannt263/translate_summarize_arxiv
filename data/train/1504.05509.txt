    "by employing the dissociation energy and the equilibrium bond length for a diatomic molecule as explicit parameters , jia et al @xcite generated improved expressions for some well - known potentials including rosen - morse , manning - rosen , tietz and frost - musulin potential energy functions .",
    "these authors found that the well - known tietz potential function is conventionally defined in terms of five parameters but it actually has only four independent parameters .",
    "furthermore , the wei @xcite and tietz potential functions @xcite are exactly same solvable empirical functions .",
    "wang et al @xcite also generated improved expressions for two versions of the schiberg potential energy function which are the rosen - morse and manning - rosen potential functions . by choosing the experimental values of the dissociation energy , equilibrium bond length and equilibrium harmonic vibrational frequency as inputs",
    ", the authors obtained the average deviations of the energies calculated with the potential model from the experimental data for five diatomic molecules , and find that no one of six three - parameter empirical potential energy functions is superior to the other potentials in fitting experimental data for all molecules examined .",
    "all these efforts were made in an attempt to find a most suitable molecular potential in its description of diatomic molecules .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we suggest stw as a modification for the tw [ 2 - 8 ] . this potential can be written as @xmath12 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the molecular bond length , @xmath15 is the morse constant , @xmath16 is the potential well depth and @xmath17 is an optimization parameter obtained from ab initio or rydberg - klein - rees ( rkr ) intramolecular potentials .",
    "@xmath18 is the internuclear distance .",
    "when the potential constant approaches zero , i.e. @xmath19 , the stw potential reduces to the morse potential @xcite .",
    "this potential is just the tw potential shifted by dissociation energy @xmath20 .",
    "the shape of this potential is shown in figure [ fig1]a for different molecules .",
    "diatomic molecule with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24.,width=680,height=377 ]    figure [ fig1]b compare between tw diatomic molecular potential , stw diatomic molecular potential and the morse potential using the parameters set for @xmath25 diatomic molecule . as it can be seen from this plot ,",
    "the shifted tietz - wei and the morse potentials are very close to each other for large values of @xmath18 in the regions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but they are very different at @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the shifted tietz - wei potential is as good as traditional morse potential and better than the tietz - wei potential in stimulating the atomic interaction for diatomic molecules .",
    "the scheme of our presentation is as follows . in the next section",
    "we give basic ingredient of exact quantization rule and all necessary formulas for our calculations .",
    "we solve the radial schrdinger equation for the stw and also obtain the rotational - vibrational energy spectrum for some diatomic molecules in section 3 .",
    "finally , results and conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "here we give a brief review on the eqr .",
    "the details can be found in refs .",
    "[ 10 - 24 ] . in 2005",
    ", ma and xu @xcite by carefully studying one - dimensional schrdinger equation , have extended results to three - dimensional case by simply making the replacements @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31\\left[\\frac{d\\phi(r)}{dr}\\right]^{-1}dr,\\ \\ \\ \\ k(r)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2}[e - v_{eff}(r ) ] } ,   \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two turning points determined by @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 is the number of the nodes of @xmath36 in the region @xmath37 and is larger by one than the number @xmath7 of the nodes of wave function @xmath38 .",
    "the first term @xmath39 is the contribution from the nodes of the logarithmic derivative of wave function , and the second is called the quantum correction .    in this approach , the energy spectrum equation is obtained by solving the two integrals involved in equation ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "this quantization rule has been used in many physical systems to obtain the exact solutions of many exactly solvable quantum systems [ 10 - 24 ] .",
    "eqr is a very important foundation to proper quantization rule ( pqr ) @xcite .",
    "to study any quantum physical model characterized by the diatomic molecular potential given by equation ( [ e1 ] ) , we need to solve the following schrdinger equation for spherically symmetric potential in any arbitrary dimensional space : @xmath40 now , by defining the wavefunction @xmath41 as @xmath42 and taking @xmath43 as the stw diatomic molecular potential , the radial part of equation ( [ e3 ] ) can be found as @xmath44 ^ 2-\\frac{\\left(\\tilde{\\eta}^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\hbar^2}{2\\mu r^2}\\right]r_{n\\ell}(r)=0 , \\label{e4}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath45 denote the principal quantum numbers , orbital angular momentum numbers and the bound state energy eigenvalues of the system under consideration ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 which is a linear combination of the spatial dimensions @xmath48 and the angular momentum quantum number @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath49 , problem in the form ( [ e4 ] ) is exactly solvable .",
    "but for @xmath50 , it is not due to the centrifugal barrier . therefore , in order to solve the above equation for @xmath50 states , hamzavi et al @xcite found that the following formula is a good approximation scheme to deal with the centrifugal barrier : @xmath51 with    @xmath52    constant @xmath53 has been introduced for mathematical simplicity .",
    "now , by inserting this approximation into equation ( [ e4 ] ) and then introducing a new transformation of the form @xmath54 through the mapping function @xmath55 with @xmath18 in the domain @xmath56 or @xmath57 in the domain @xmath58 $ ] , we obtain the following second order differential equation : @xmath59r_{n\\ell}(\\zeta)=0,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{with}\\label{e7}\\\\ & & v_{eff}(\\zeta)=\\left[\\mathcal{a}+\\frac{\\mathcal{b}}{e^{\\alpha\\zeta}-c_h}+\\frac{\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)d_2}{r_e^2}+\\frac{2\\mu v_e}{\\hbar^2}(c_h-1)^2}{\\left(e^{\\alpha\\zeta}-c_h\\right)}+\\mathcal{f}{\\left(e^{\\alpha\\zeta}-c_h\\right)^2}\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathcal{a}=\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}^2-\\frac{1}{4}}{r_e^2}\\right)\\frac{d_0\\hbar^2}{2\\mu},\\ \\ \\mathcal{b}=\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}^2-\\frac{1}{4}}{r_e^2}\\right)\\frac{d_1\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}+2v_e(c_h-1),\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathcal{f}=\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}^2-\\frac{1}{4}}{r_e^2}\\right)\\frac{d_2\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}+v_e(c_h-1)^2.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we define @xmath60 , then we can obtain the two turning points @xmath61 and @xmath62 as well as their sum and product properties by solving @xmath63 or @xmath64 as : @xmath65^{1/2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we can write the non - linear riccati equation for the ground state is as @xmath66=0 \\label{e9}\\ ] ] since the logarithmic derivative @xmath67 for the ground state has one zero and no pole , it has to take the linear form in @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we assume the following solution for the ground states @xmath69 by putting equation ( [ e10 ] ) into ( [ e9 ] ) , we can solve the non - linear riccati equation .",

    "this is the same transformational invariance described for bound states of free atoms and molecules @xcite and demonstrates the existence of interdimensional degeneracies among states of the confined hulth@xmath92n potential .",
    "the advantage of the approach employed in this study is that it gives the eigenvalues through the calculation of two integral given by equation ( [ e2 ] ) and solving the resulting algebraic equation .",
    "firstly , we can easily obtain the quantum correction by only considering the solution of the ground state of the quantum system since it is independent of the number of nodes of the wave function for exactly solvable quantum system .",
    "the general expressions obtained for the energy eigenvalues and wave functions can be easily reduced to the 3d space ( d = 3 ) and for s - wave ( i.e. @xmath49 state ) .",
    "the eqr produce as good results as the pqr , however the procedure followed using pqr is more shorter and quick .",
