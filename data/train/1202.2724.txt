    "how likely is it that the resulting orientation prescription defines a combinatorial flow ?",
    "more precisely , we equip the set of orientation prescriptions @xmath22 with the uniform probability measure , and we denote by @xmath47 the probability that a random orientation prescription is a combinatorial flow .",

    "in particular , if @xmath50 denotes the @xmath51-skeleton of the triangulation , then @xmath52 .",
    "for this reason we will concentrate excusively on @xmath51-dimensional complexes , i.e. , graphs .    consider a graph @xmath53 with vertex set @xmath54 and edge set @xmath55 . if @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath53 consists of isolated points , then trivially @xmath57 .",

    "we deduce @xmath81 note that the above upper bound is optimal : we have equality when @xmath53 consists of disjoint edges .",
