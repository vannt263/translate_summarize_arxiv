    "we study hierarchical bayesian methods for linear inverse problems . in particular , we consider inverse problems with different discretizations and the phenomena which appear when the discretization is refined .",
    "the effect of fine discretization has recently been studied for gaussian inverse problems in @xcite , and motivated by this development we consider hierarchical gaussian models .",
    "more precisely , we introduce a hierarchical solution method and analyze its properties with arbitrarily fine discretization .",
    "the inverse problem we consider is the linear signal restoration problem where the measurement @xmath0 relates indirectly to the unknown signal @xmath1 via @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the unit circle which we frequently consider as the interval @xmath4 $ ] with the end points identified .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 is a smoothing linear integral operator , and @xmath6 is random noise .",
    "the signals are considered on the unit circle @xmath3 to avoid the complicated boundary effects that fall outside the scope of this paper .    in the bayesian approach @xmath1 and @xmath6",
    "are modelled as random functions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 random functions where @xmath9 is an element of a complete probability space @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath8 model our _ a priori _ knowledge on the unknown signal @xmath1 and error @xmath6 , respectively , before the measurement is obtained .",
    "below , the variable @xmath12 is often omitted .",
    "the ideal measurement is considered to be a realization of the random function @xmath13 on @xmath14 . in bayesian inversion",
    "the aim is to make statistical inference on @xmath15 given a realization @xmath16 of the random function @xmath17 , and the bayesian solution to the inverse problem means finding the conditional probability distribution of @xmath15 , called the _ posterior distribution _ , or some estimates for this distribution .",
    "typically studied point estimates are the expectation of the posteriori distribution called the _ conditional mean _ ( cm ) estimate and the maximum point of the posterior density called the _",
    "maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) estimate .    in bayesian inversion",
    "a reconstruction method is said to be edge - preserving if the functions @xmath18 which have high probability with respect to the posterior distribution are roughly speaking piecewise smooth and have rapidly changing values only in a set of small measure . in the finite - dimensional bayesian inversion theory a number of methods have been introduced for obtaining edge - preserving reconstructions @xcite . in this paper the prior distribution of the random function",
    "@xmath15 has a gaussian distribution such that its covariance depends on an auxiliary random function @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the random function @xmath19 has a gaussian distribution .",
    "such a model is called _ hierarchical gaussian model_. with a fixed discretization similar models have been studied in inverse problems in @xcite . furthermore , in the work by calvetti and somersalo @xcite hierarchical methods have been used for image processing problems to obtain edge - preserving and numerically efficient reconstruction algorithms .",
    "we also mention that the edge - preserving reconstruction methods have been extensively studied in the deterministic problem setting , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our main result in this paper connects computing the map estimate of a hierarchical gaussian model to the minimization of the mumford  shah functional @xcite used in image processing . as a byproduct we also present new results concerning the existence of a minimizer of the mumford  shah functional .",
    "let us next discuss the discretization of bayesian inverse problems . above we have considered @xmath20 and @xmath21 as random functions defined on the unit circle . for any practical computations",
    "such models have to be discretized , i.e. , to be approximated by random variables taking values in a finite dimensional space . roughly speaking",
    ", a bayesian model is said to be _ discretization invariant _ , if for fixed model parameters it works coherently at any level of discretization . for an extended discussion on the discretization invariance and the relation of the practical measurement models and the computational models considered below , see @xcite . in the ideal model",
    "the noise @xmath22 can be considered as a background noise . in this paper",
    "we will further assume that the practical measurement setting produces an additional instrumentation noise .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the practical measurement can be modelled as a realizations of a random variable @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where operator @xmath25 is a finite dimensional projection .",
    "the random variable @xmath26 describes the instrumentation noise and it takes values in the range of @xmath25 .",
    "increasing the number @xmath27 corresponds here to the case when we make more or finer observations of the ideal measurement signal @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , in practical computations also @xmath15 needs to be approximated by a finite dimensional random variable @xmath28 which leads us to consider the _ computational model _",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 are parameters related to discretizing the measurement and the unknown , respectively . in equation ( [ eq : compmodel ] )",
    "we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a random variable in range of @xmath25 satisfying @xmath33    in developing new bayesian algorithms , it is important to study if the posterior distribution given by problem ( [ eq : compmodel ] ) or some preferred estimate converges when @xmath27 or @xmath34 increase .",
    "this question is often non - trivial .",
    "for example , for the total variation prior it is proven in @xcite that the map and cm estimates converge under different conditions as discretization is refined . moreover , if the free parameters of the discrete total variation priors are chosen so that the posterior distribution converges , then the limit is a gaussian distribution .",
    "hence , the key property of the total variation prior is lost in very fine discretizations .",
    "this example illustrates the difficulty involved in discretizing non - gaussian distributions .",
    "also in this paper we will observe that the convergence of the map and cm estimates occurs in different cases .",
    "let us next formally define the discrete models we study .",
    "set @xmath35 and let points @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 identified with @xmath39 , denote an equispaced mesh on @xmath3 .",
    "we define @xmath40 to be the space of continuous functions @xmath41 such that @xmath42 is linear on each interval @xmath43 $ ] for @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath45 be the space of functions @xmath46 such that @xmath42 is constant on each interval @xmath47 for @xmath44 .",
    "denote by @xmath48 the orthogonal projections with respect to @xmath49 inner product and let @xmath50 be the projection to constant functions .",
    "define the operator @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the derivative with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the hierarchical structure is defined in two steps .",
    "first , let @xmath55 be a gaussian random variable in @xmath40 with density function @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the number of mesh points . here and below @xmath60",
    "is a generic constant whose value may vary . then choose @xmath61 to be a sample of @xmath55 .",
    "the random variable @xmath62 , conditioned on @xmath61 , is then defined as a gaussian random variable on @xmath40 with density function @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath65 depends on @xmath61 . since the density function presentation in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces is non - standard",
    ", we give in section 2 a definition of random variables @xmath62 and @xmath55 based on the coordinate representation .",
    "roughly speaking , the sample @xmath66 has a high probability if it varies from @xmath67 only little and this variation becomes less smooth if @xmath68 is decreased .",
    "a sample of @xmath69 has a high probability if it varies rapidly only near the points where @xmath66 is close to zero .",
    "hence the role of parameter @xmath70 is to control how sharp jumps @xmath69 can have and consequently , we call it the _ sharpness _ of the prior .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath71 describes the _ scaling _ of the prior information .",
    "the bigger the value of @xmath71 the more concentrated the prior distribution",
    ".    in consequence of the construction above the probability density of the joint distribution of @xmath72 has a form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 the logarithmic term in ( [ eq : fn_formal ] ) appears due to the fact that the normalization constant @xmath65 in ( [ eq : formalprior2 ] ) depends on @xmath66 .",
    "it turns out that the functional @xmath76 is closely connected to the widely studied segmentation method in deterministic image and signal processing , namely , the mumford - shah functional @xmath77 with respect to function @xmath18 and the set @xmath78 of the points where @xmath18 jumps @xcite .",
    "the notation @xmath79 stands for the number of points in @xmath78 .",
    "this functional is known to be difficult to handle numerically and a number of approximations to the variational problem of minimizing ( [ eq : strong_ms ] ) have been introduced . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the mumford  shah functional can be approximated by elliptic functionals in the sense of @xmath80-convergence .",
    "these ambrosio - tortorelli functionals are the key element in our presentation .",
    "let us describe our main results .",
    "we study the behaviour of the map estimate in the case when the discretization parameters @xmath27 and @xmath34 are coupled . for the sake of presentation",
    "we assume @xmath81 and drop @xmath27 from the notations .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath82 is white noise with variance depending on @xmath34 and scaling parameter @xmath83 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath82 is a gaussian random function on @xmath3 taking values in @xmath84 with zero expectation and covariance @xmath85 for any @xmath86 .",
    "notice that consequently @xmath87 and the choice of @xmath83 describes how the norm of the noise is expected to behave asymptotically .",
    "we emphasize that the case when @xmath88 corresponds an assumption that more measurements produces _ better accuracy expectation _ whereas with @xmath89 one assumes that the accuracy in the norm of @xmath49 is expected to stay stable .",
    "an example of the case @xmath90 is when the background noise @xmath22 is negligible and the instrumentation noise follows asymptotics ( [ intro_noise ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath91 corresponds to the discretization of the gaussian white noise , see @xcite .",
    "to be able to prove positive results for the convergence of the map estimates we will assume @xmath92 this implies that the scaling parameter of the prior distribution is determined by the variance of the noise in discretized measurements .",
    "the case when ( [ k_equals_a ] ) is not valid is discussed in remark [ k_not_equal_a ] . due to the equality ( [ k_equals_a ] ) we drop the notation @xmath83 and",
    "use @xmath71 as the scaling parameter of the noise distribution .    under these assumptions",
    "the map estimate for @xmath72 corresponding the measurement @xmath93 , @xmath94 in @xmath49 , is a minimizer @xmath95 in the theorems [ neg_result ] and [ pos_result ] we prove for the map estimates :    * for @xmath96 the minimization problems ( [ eq : maps ] ) diverge as @xmath97 . * for @xmath98",
    "the map estimates @xmath99 converge to the minimizer , denoted @xmath100 , of a perturbed ambrosio  tortorelli functional as @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , the functions @xmath100 are shown to converge up to a subsequence to the minimizer of the mumford  shah functional ( [ eq : strong_ms ] ) as @xmath102 .    in @xcite and remark [ remarkb ] the following is shown , with slightly different assumptions on operator @xmath5 , for the convergence of prior distributions and the cm estimate    * for @xmath96 the random variables @xmath72 converge in distribution on @xmath103 and the cm estimates @xmath104 converge in @xmath103 as @xmath97 .",
    "* for @xmath98 the random variables @xmath72 converge to zero as @xmath97 .",
    "the type of convergence in ( b ) is discussed in remark [ remarkb ] .",
    "consequently , the results ( a),(b ) and ( a),(b ) illustrate how the convergence properties of the map and cm estimates are different for hierarchical gaussian models .",
    "let us recall that the cm and map estimate coincide for finite dimensional gaussian inverse problems @xcite .",
    "typically the map estimates are computationally faster to obtain than the cm estimates and thus in inverse problems close to gaussian ones the map estimate is used as an approximation of the cm estimate .",
    "the above results show that this is not the case for the hierarchical gaussian models in general .",
    "finally , let us consider the current perspectives to bayesian modelling and how this paper connects to earlier work .",
    "bayesian inversion in infinite - dimensional function spaces were first studied by franklin in @xcite .",
    "this research has then been continued and generalized in @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the posterior distribution is studied in @xcite . in relation to result @xmath105 the convergence of posterior distribution",
    "is studied in @xcite when objective information becomes more accurate with gaussian prior and noise distributions . for a general resource on the bayesian inverse problems theory and computation see @xcite . for non - gaussian noise models in statistical inverse problems",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the mumford  shah functional has been applied to inverse problems for instance in @xcite and for related work in image processing problems see @xcite .",
    "finally we mention that variational approximation with @xmath80-convergence is used earlier in the context of inverse problems in e.g. @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the stochastic model and necessary tools to tackle the convergence problems related to map estimates .",
    "section 3 covers the main results and the proofs are postponed to sections 5 and 6 . in section 4",
    "we study the existence of map estimates and section 5 discusses the cases when desired convergence does not take place . in section 6 the proofs related @xmath80-convergence and equi - coerciveness of the functionals .",
    "finally , in section 7 we illustrate the method in practise by numerical examples .",
    "in this section we cover the stochastic model introduced in @xcite and furthermore give the main tools and theoretical results concerning the variational problem of the map estimate .",
    "let us first introduce some notation .",
    "most function spaces in our presentation have structure of a real separable hilbert space .",
    "we often use the @xmath106-based sobolev spaces @xmath107 for any @xmath108 equipped with hilbert space inner product @xmath109 for any @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "however , we also study the banach structure of @xmath107 with dual space @xmath112 . in this setting the banach dual pairing is denoted by @xmath113 .",
    "we also denote @xmath114)$ ] , @xmath115 , for functions @xmath116 such that @xmath117 a.e . for @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , we discuss spaces @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "we say that a sequence @xmath121 converges to @xmath122 strongly in banach space @xmath123 , if @xmath124 as @xmath125 .",
    "recall from hilbert space valued stochastics @xcite that a covariance operator @xmath126 of a gaussian random variable @xmath127 is defined by equality @xmath128 for all @xmath129 .",
    "we call a gaussian random variable centered if @xmath130 .",
    "we use a perturbed derivative @xmath131 , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 and any @xmath135 .",
    "this construction guarantees that @xmath136 and @xmath137 are invertible mappings .",
    "let us now shortly describe how we define the bayesian maximum a posteriori estimate for the computational model given in equation ( [ eq : compmodel ] ) .",
    "let @xmath138 and @xmath139 be two real hilbert spaces such that @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "assume that @xmath28 obtains realizations in a @xmath142 and the range of the measurement projection @xmath25 is @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath144 and @xmath145 be two arbitrary isometries .",
    "let us now map equation ( [ eq : compmodel ] ) to a matrix equation @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "if the a priori and likelihood distributions above are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure the posteriori distribution can be obtained by the bayes formula : the posteriori density @xmath151 then has the form @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 . in equation ( [ eq : bayesformula ] ) functions @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the prior and likelihood densities , respectively , and @xmath157 is the density of @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "the standard definition of the maximum a posteriori estimate is then @xmath159 where the set on the right - hand side consist of all points @xmath160 maximizing @xmath161 .",
    "the value of @xmath162 is commonly defined as the map estimate of problem ( [ eq : compmodel ] ) .",
    "another point estimate in bayesian inversion is the cm estimate which is defined as the integral @xmath163 we note that although the posterior density depends on the inner products @xmath164 and @xmath165 both point estimates are invariant with respect to such choices . for more information about the point estimates",
    "see @xcite for cm and @xcite for map estimation in hilbert spaces .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce the prior model discussed in the introduction and explain the meaning of the density function representation in equations ( [ eq : formalprior1 ] ) and ( [ eq : formalprior2 ] ) .",
    "let us first review the infinite dimensional prior model introduced in @xcite . consider a centered gaussian distribution @xmath166 on @xmath49 with covariance operator @xmath167 with @xmath168 and multiplication operator @xmath169 defined as @xmath170 for any @xmath171 .",
    "let us now formally discuss the qualitative behavior of @xmath166 .",
    "such a distribution has the property that in a set of @xmath11 where @xmath172 is large the samples from distribution @xmath166 are likely to be smooth .",
    "vice versa , in sets where @xmath172 is small the distribution allows more rapid changes .",
    "next we set the prior distribution of random variable @xmath15 to be @xmath166 .",
    "however , the crucial step in hierarchical modelling is to model the values of @xmath173 with a random variable @xmath19 .",
    "thus , instead of knowing the exact locations of the jumps , we model how they are distributed . in @xcite",
    "the random variable @xmath19 is gaussian with expectation @xmath174 and covariance operator @xmath175 on @xmath49 .",
    "denote the distribution of @xmath19 on @xmath49 by @xmath176 .",

    "this construction is shown in @xcite to be well - defined .    in the following",
    "we define the finite dimensional prior structure studied in this paper with all scalings @xmath180 . in @xcite these random variables are shown to converge to @xmath15 and @xmath19 in distribution on @xmath181 when @xmath96 .",
    "first define two inner products on @xmath182 , namely , @xmath183 for any @xmath184 .",
    "next construct two orthonormal basis @xmath185 with respect to inner products @xmath164 and @xmath186 , respectively , in the following way : for any @xmath187 we have @xmath188 where @xmath189 , @xmath190 .",
    "such a construction can be obtained , e.g. , using the gram - schmidt orthonormalization procedure . to simplify our notations",
    "we assume that the probability space @xmath10 has the additional structure @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",

    "following the procedure shown in section [ sec : bayes ] choose @xmath207 to be two isometries with respect to inner products @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively , and with the usual inner product of @xmath208 .",
