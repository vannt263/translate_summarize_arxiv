    "during the last decade , gravitational lensing has become an invaluable tool for constraining the mass of many different structures ( exoplanets , stars , galaxies , clusters , large scale structure , etc . ) and has significantly improved our knowledge of many of these systems .",
    "however , there have been very few results for absorption line systems , which is unfortunate because these objects present a number of interesting aspects : low - ionisation metal lines and strong hi lines sample the cold dense gas bound in galactic systems , independent of the galaxy luminosities .",
    "moreover absorption - line measurements are largely insensitive to redshift and give us access to early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "+ gravitational lensing by absorbers has been investigated theoretically by a number of authors .",
    "so far all studies have focused on hydrogen line absorbers , which offer easier theoretical modeling than metal lines since complications due to gas metallicities can be avoided . for most of these investigations , lensing has been studied for its effects on quasar luminosity functions , i.e. the magnification bias , and on the observed distribution of impact parameters with respect to the center of the lenses ( pei 1995 , bartelmann & loeb 1996 , smette  1997 , hamana et al .",
    "2000 , le brun  2000 , maller et al .",
    "2002 , perna et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , only a few authors have used this technique to study the absorber systems themselves .",
    "several studies have used multiple quasar images to probe the extent of gas clouds ( smette et al .",
    "1995 , kobayashi et al .",
    "2002 , ellison et al 2004 ) , but in the context of absorbers , gravitational lensing has rarely been used to constrain the mass properties of the lenses , _ i.e. the purpose for which it is usually used_. as far as we know , only maller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have proposed a method to investigate the properties of an absorber population using lensing .",
    "they suggested analyzing the distribution of lyman - limit systems as a function of column density , assuming that the corresponding unlensed distribution follows a power law , and they showed how to use the measured deviations to obtain a lower limit for the mass to gas column density ratio of these systems .",
    "unfortunately , their method requires a very large number of quasars and has not been applied so far .",
    "+ this general lack of observational results for absorber systems might originate in the preferential focus of previous studies on lyman-@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "indeed , analytic models can be used more easily than for other absorption lines and strong systems like dlas are expected to trace the inner part of dark matter halos and therefore favor gravitational magnification effects .",
    "however the quantity relevant to obtaining observational results is not simply the amplitude of lensing effects , but the signal - to - noise ratio of the detection that can be achieved . in such a case , strong lyman-@xmath0 absorbers might not be optimal candidates because large samples are difficult to build .    whereas for damped lyman-@xmath0 absorbers theoretical studies exist but observational results are lacking , the situation is the opposite for metal absorbers : no theoretical prediction has been made so far but a few authors have attempted to detect magnification effects of metal absorber systems . the first observational approach was to fit lensing models to the redshift evolution of quasar absorbers to disentangle intrinsic evolution from gravitational lensing ( thomas & webster 1990 , borgeest & mehlert 1993 ) ; however , these studies could not find any signal from lensing .",
    "another approach first suggested by york  ( 1991 ) was to divide a sample of quasar spectra into bright and faint subsamples in order to determine the incidence of metal absorbers ( civ , siiv ) in each subsample separately .",
    "however these authors found no clear evidence of gravitational lensing .",
    "van den berk   ( 1996 ) extended the analysis to a larger sample of quasar spectra compiled from the literature .",
    "they found an excess of civ absorbers in luminous quasars but did not find a similar trend in the available  sample .",
    "more recently , mnard & proux ( 2003 ) used the 2df - quasar survey to compare the number of quasars with and without absorbers as a function of magnitude .",
    "they found a relative excess of bright quasars with absorbers as well as indications of reddening effects .",
    "finally , mnard , nestor and turnshek have performed a more detailed analysis with data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and find similar results ( mnard et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "+ the variety of results obtained in all these analyses turn out to be rather difficult to interpret because the absorber species , redshift and equivalent width ranges differ .",
    "moreover , as emphasized by mnard & proux ( 2003 ) , such analyses can easily be biased if the selection of the objects is not done carefully enough . for example , since absorption lines are more easily detected in high signal - to - noise ratio spectra and since these tend to correspond to bright quasars , a naive absorption line selection would introduce systematic magnitude shifts .",
    "in addition , the lack of theoretical estimates did not allow for any guidance in interpreting the existing observational results .",
    "in this paper we present the first calculation of statistical magnification effects due to metal absorbers and investigate the possible constraints on the absorber mass distribution . in section [ section_theory ]",
    "we first motivate the use of metal absorption lines , which possess a number of properties better suited for statistical analyses than lyman-@xmath0 lines",
    ". then we present a method for extracting the signal expected from gravitational magnification and show how to use it to constrain the mass distribution of these systems . in section [ section_mu_pdf ] , in order to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique , we use recent data on mgii systems , along with a simple lensing model to estimate the amplitude of the expected effects .",
    "finally , we estimate the corresponding noise level in section [ section_detectability ] and show that the sdss might provide the necessary data for a detection .",
    "narrow metal absorption lines and damped lyman-@xmath0 lines found in quasar spectra are usually believed to indicate the presence of a galaxy along the line - of - sight ( bahcall & spitzer 1969 ) . in some rare cases , in which the absorbing galaxy is massive enough and the impact parameter is less than a few kpc , such a source - lens - observer configuration can give rise to multiple quasar images ( see for example turnshek et al .",
    "however , most often when absorption lines are detected in a quasar spectrum , such configurations are not encountered and lensing modifies the magnitude of the source without producing additional images .",
    "measuring these lensing effects can then only be done in a statistical sense , because we do not know a priori the intrinsic magnitude of a given background quasar . a large sample of quasars and absorber systems is therefore required in order to detect the magnification due to absorbers .",
    "+ as mentioned in the introduction , gravitational lensing by strong lyman-@xmath0 absorbers has already been investigated theoretically by a number of authors , motivated by the fact that such absorption features trace the inner part of galactic halos and are therefore expected to favor gravitational lensing effects .",
    "unfortunately , lyman-@xmath0 lines can only be seen at redshifts @xmath3 from the ground so that only a small fraction of observed quasars can allow for their detection .",
    "it is thus difficult to build a large sample of such absorption lines .",
    "another drawback related to the high redshift ranges comes from the fact that the lensing efficiency drops if both lenses and sources are located at @xmath3 .",
    "the statistical nature of the problem and the redshift ranges involved motivate the use of metal lines . given the large range of possible absorption wavelengths",
    "they can be found at various redshifts from the ground , they can therefore be selected in order to maximize the lensing efficiency , and they probe a large range of galactic impact parameters , from a hundred kpc down to a few kpc . therefore metal lines appear to be more appropriate than lyman-@xmath0 lines for the purpose of detecting statistical magnification effects . the method presented below",
    "can be applied to absorption lines like mgii , feii , siii , civ , etc . in section [ section_mu_pdf ]",
    "we will explore its feasibility by estimating the signal expected in the case of mgii absorption lines .",
    "their 2796,2803 @xmath4 doublet can be observed from the ground over a very large range of redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , they are astrophysically abundant , and they have been seen to be very close tracers of optically thick h i gas ( bergeron & stasinska 1986 ) .",
    "we will consider strong mgii absorbers , i.e. with a rest equivalent width @xmath6 .",
    "such systems can be detected with the relatively low spectroscopic resolutions @xmath7 used in current large surveys like 2df and sdss .",
    "the presence of a galaxy close to the line - of - sight of a background source can modify its brightness in two ways : first , it can act as a gravitational lens and amplify the flux of the source and second , the presence of dust around the galaxy can extinct and redden the source s light .",
    "this can be described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the altered flux of a source behind an galaxy , @xmath10 is the flux that would be observed without intervening system , @xmath11 is the optical depth of the galaxy and @xmath12 its gravitational amplification .",
    "the corresponding magnitude change can then be written m & = & m - m _ + & = & -2.5()+ ( ) . whereas gravitational magnification is achromatic , extinction effects strongly depend on wavelength and usually become small in near infrared bands . in this paper",
    "we will focus on magnification only , arguing that observations at appropriate wavelengths can isolate the lensing effects .",
    "below , it will be shown how to get constraints on dust extinction of metal absorbers using the proposed measurements .",
    "let us consider an area of the sky which is large enough for the mean magnification to be close to unity . in this area ,",
    "let us consider a population of sources , with a fraction of them being lensed .",
    "let @xmath13 be the intrinsic magnitude distribution of the the unlensed sources and let @xmath14 be that of the lensed ones .",
    "let @xmath15 be the fraction of sources behind a lens and @xmath16 be the distribution of magnitude shifts induced by these systems .",
    "we then have the following relation between the magnitude number counts : @xmath17 if the lenses can be counted independently from the sources , @xmath15 can then be estimated separately and information on the magnification properties of the lenses , i.e. the distribution @xmath16 , can be extracted from the observed number of lensed sources at a given magnitude .",
    "this information has been the one measured for example in the case of quasar - galaxy correlations induced by lensing .",
    "in such a case , the magnification bias changes the number density of background sources angularly close to foreground lenses ( see for example bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "however , if lenses can not be observed independently from their background sources , as is the case for systems seen in absorption , a degeneracy exists between the intrinsic number of lenses and the amplitude of the magnification bias , at a given magnitude . as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq_convolution ] , increasing the fraction of lenses @xmath15 or increasing their magnification , i.e. @xmath18 , produce similar effects at a given magnitude . therefore , probing lensing effects must be done by measuring changes in the shape of the magnitude distribution of the lensed population , @xmath14 , with respect to that of the reference population @xmath13 . in the following",
    "we will estimate this effect in the context of absorption lines detected in quasars spectra .",
    "let us consider a population of quasars with absorber systems having a rest equivalent width greater than a certain threshold @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the intrinsic magnitude distribution of this quasar population , and let @xmath20 be that of a population of random quasars .",
    "it should be noted that lensing effects by absorber systems with equivalent widths smaller than @xmath19 also occur .",
    "however , they are expected to statistically affect the two distributions @xmath20 and @xmath14 in the same way and will therefore not introduce any change between them .    the convolution introduced in eq .",
    "[ eq_convolution ] implies that the distribution of induced magnitude changes @xmath16 , which contains information on absorber masses , can in principle be recovered via fourier space or using appropriate deconvolution techniques .",
    "however a number of constraints complicate such analyses in practice .",
    "the quantities directly accessible to observations are _",
    "^(m)&=&_(m ) c(m ) + _ ^(m)&=&_(m ) c(m ) , [ eq_fourier ] where @xmath21 is the completeness of the detection procedure . for a purely flux - limited sample of point sources",
    ", we have @xmath22 if @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the survey limiting magnitude , and 0 otherwise . for quasars ,",
    "however , the situation is different .",
    "their selection depends on both their magnitude and colors . in practice",
    ", the corresponding completeness functions usually drop from unity to zero over some magnitude range that is significant compared with the magnitude range of the survey . recovering the function @xmath25",
    "will therefore be very noisy in the range of magnitudes where @xmath21 becomes small .",
    "here we propose to extract the lensing signal by using the moments of the observed magnitude number counts , and use them in order to constrain the distribution of induced magnitude changes @xmath26 .",
    "let us first define the observed mean magnitudes of the two quasar populations : @xmath27 these quantities are directly obtained from observations and do not require binning the data .",
    "we can now define the _",
    "observable _ mean magnitude shift as : @xmath28 similarly , we can introduce higher - order moments : m_^i&= & + & = &  , [ eq_higher_order_moments ] and the corresponding observable differences : @xmath29    as we can see by combining the previous equations , the observable quantities @xmath30 can be used to probe the unknown distribution @xmath16 .",
    "we have for example for the first - order moment : @xmath31 since @xmath32 can be measured from the general distribution of quasars without absorbers and @xmath33 can be estimated for a given survey , this equation shows that a model for the distribution of induced magnitude changes @xmath16 can be constrained from observations .",
    ". [ eq_all ] can be generalized to higher - order moments .",
    "it is then possible to define the likehood @xmath34 of the @xmath35 measured moments @xmath36 and minimize it in order to find the optimal parameters for @xmath26 , i.e. a quantity related to the distribution of absorber masses and impact parameters .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test can also be used in order to compare the observed and predicted distributions @xmath37 , and find the optimal parameters for @xmath16 .",
    "observed_-magnitude changes strongly depend on the slope of the quasar luminosity distribution .",
    "indeed the final effect can either be an increase or a decrease of the mean magnitude of quasars with absorbers relative to those without absorbers .",
    "furthermore , magnification effects _ can not _ be observed if the number of quasars as a function of luminosity follows a power law .",
    "indeed , in this case we would have @xmath38 and , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq_first_moment ] and [ eq_obs ] : _ ( m)a^(m - m ) ( m ) ( m ) a^m  .",
    "therefore the moments of @xmath37 and @xmath20 are the same and @xmath39 , whatever the value of the induced magnitude shift @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this absence of observational lensing effects can be understood in the following way : gravitational magnification makes each source brighter but allows also new sources to be detectable as they become brighter than the limiting magnitude of a given survey .",
    "this latter effect increases the number of faint sources and tends to diminish the mean flux of the detected objects . for a power law luminosity distribution ,",
    "the flux increase due to magnification effects is exactly canceled by the additional faint sources that enter the sample due to magnification , and lensing effects due to absorbers can not be observed .",
    "therefore , it is possible to detect changes in the magnitude distribution of a population lensed by absorbers only if its unlensed number counts depart from a power law as a function of luminosity .",
    "it is interesting to note that , on the observational side , constraints on dust extinction can be obtained by measuring the moment excess in different bands : the quantities @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two different wavelengths , will directly probe dust extinction and will not be sensitive to magnification effects .",
    "this will allow us to probe the statistical properties of the reddening curve of absorbers systems as well as the relative optical depth as a function of absorber rest equivalent width ( mnard et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in the next section we will quantify the detectability of statistical lensing effects of quasars by absorbers .",
    "we will first estimate the expected distribution of induced magnitude changes due to a population of mgii absorbers and then compute the expected excess in the moments of the observed magnitude distributions @xmath30 .",
    "in the following we estimate the magnification effects of absorber systems by assuming a mass profile and using existing observations of the distribution of absorber impact parameters .",
    "our analysis does not aim at presenting an accurate model for absorber systems but only at giving a rough estimate of their expected magnification effects and at showing how to use them to constrain the mass distribution of absorbing galaxies .",
    "as mentioned in section [ section_choice ] , we focus only on mgii absorption lines that can be detected in current large surveys , i.e. with @xmath45 . based on the 2df quasar survey , outram et al ( 2001 )",
    "have detected about one hundred such absorbers in the spectra of roughly one thousand quasars with high signal - to - noise ratio and only about one percent of quasars with two strong absorbers in their spectrum .",
    "this shows that multiple lensing of a single quasar can safely be neglected in our case .",
    "+ in the following , we will assume for convenience that the mass distribution of the galaxies responsible for the absorption is described by a singular isothermal sphere profile ( more sophisticated magnification calculations are presented in perrotta  2002 ) .",
    "the galactic halos therefore have the following density and surface density :   ( r)= , [ eq_sis ] and the corresponding magnification effects of a point source can then be computed in a simple way : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the impact parameter normalized to the einstein radius of the lens : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath50 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source .    as can been seen from the above equations ,",
    "the use of magnification effects to constrain masses requires the knowledge of the relevant halo radii . in the case of mgii systems",
    "such quantities have been measured by steidel  ( 1994 ) and steidel ( 1995 ) .",
    "they used deep observations of a sample of 58 mgii absorber systems ( with a mean redshift @xmath51 ) in addition to a spectroscopic follow up in order to identify the galaxies responsible for the absorption . from these observations they measured the distribution of absorber rest equivalent widths @xmath52 as a function of galactic impact parameter @xmath53 ( see fig .",

    "such changes translate into quasar flux increases of about 2 to 20% .",
    "however , we recall that these induced magnitude changes are not directly observable .",

    "[ plot_steidel ] ) reveals a correlation at the @xmath59 level between these two parameters .",
    "such an information can be taken into account in our modelling of the magnification effects .",
    "let us first assume that the gas distribution is proportional to that of the dark matter .",
    "in this case we have : ( b)= ( b)(b ) [ eq_assumption1 ] where @xmath60 is the total mass surface density , and @xmath61 is the mgii to dark matter fraction , i.e. a quantity that depends on the baryon fraction , the metallicity and the ionization background . + it is useful to note that , as infered by bahcall ( 1975 ) , the mgii gas distribution within a galactic halo is actually due to a number of individual clouds .",
    "this was recently verified by churchill  ( 1996 ) .",
    "using very high spectroscopic resolution , these authors could detect the absorption lines of individual clouds and they have shown that the overall rest equivalent width @xmath52 is proportional to the number of individual velocity components responsible for the global absorption feature . therefore , assuming that these individual clouds have similar properties we have roughly @xmath62 . in this case , the @xmath63 distribution given by steidel  ( 1994 ) can then be used to infer a distribution proportional to that of the mass surface densitites : @xmath64   \\leftrightarrow \\delta_\\mathrm{d } \\left[\\sigma(b)/\\sigma_0\\right ] \\rightarrow \\delta_\\mathrm{d } \\left[\\sigma_v/\\sigma_{v,0}\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq_delta}\\ ] ] i.e. a given value of rest equivalent width at an impact parameter @xmath53 maps into a given value of velocity dispersion for which the normalisation @xmath65 is not known . in this case , the distribution plotted in fig .",
    "[ plot_steidel ] provides us with an estimate of the distribution of relative velocity dispersions . for a given normalisation , this distribution",

    "for instance , the assumption that all the individual clouds giving rise to the overall absorption feature are similar might not hold , or as it has been argued by bond  ( 2001 ) , superwinds arising in actively star - forming galaxies can give rise to strong mgii absorption lines seen in some quasar spectra",
