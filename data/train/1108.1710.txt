    "lattice mismatch is a crucial factor determining the growth mode and morphology of heteroepitaxial metal - metal interfaces .",
    "it gives rise to pseudomorphic strained layers , but it can also be accommodated by the formation of either moir structures or incommensurate phases containing misfit dislocations where the strain is locally relieved .",
    "strain can also be important in homoepitaxial systems .",
    "the au(111 ) surface is a paradigm of the latter .",
    "a @xmath3% strain in the topmost layer is relieved by the formation of a pairwise dislocation network , yielding the well - studied ( @xmath4 ) herringbone reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the pt(111)-ag interface is a typical example of strain relief in a heteroepitaxial system @xcite . for sub - monolayer ( ml ) coverages it exhibits partial dislocations , which are removed by annealing to @xmath5 k , or at the completion of the first ml at rt ( a `` re - entrant pseudomorphic growth '' ) .",
    "the first complete ag ml is compressed with respect to a bulk ag(111 ) plane .",
    "the strain is relieved in the second ag ml by the formation of a metastable striped incommensurate ( si ) phase at room temperature .",
    "the si phase transforms to an equilibrium structure with a triangular dislocation network above @xmath5 k. in both phases dislocation lines separate domains with fcc and hcp stacking @xcite .",
    "the structure and properties of this interface depend on the ag coverage .",
    "therefore , in order to perform consistent studies , one needs to calibrate the amount of ag on the surface .",
    "while the morphology and structure of pt - ag(111 ) have been thoroughly investigated , relatively little is known of its microscopic electronic properties .",
    "we present here angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) data on the band structure of ag - pt(111 ) and of a pt(111)@xmath0mlag@xmath1bi trilayer system with @xmath6 ml .",
    "the latter was suggested by recent experiments on a biag@xmath7 surface alloy grown on ag(111 ) , showing a very large separation of opposite spin states ( rashba - bychkov effect ) @xcite .",
    "theory predicts @xcite that the size of the rashba - bychkov ( rb ) effect is very sensitive to slight changes in the atomic structure , motivating us to explore the possible influence of interfacial strain on the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "here we show that rather than the @xmath8r30@xmath9 biag@xmath7 surface alloy formed on the ag(111 ) substrate , bi atoms arrange themselves in an ordered overlayer with a @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "the resulting band structure is distinct from that of the alloy and does not exhibit signatures of a large spin - orbit splitting .",
    "by contrast , the bi - derived states effectively probe the structure of the ag film .",
    "their angular dispersion is determined by the symmetry of the underlying layer .",
    "it exhibits a change from threefold to sixfold in correspondence of the structural transition to the si phase at @xmath11 ml coverage , and then back to threefold for larger ag thicknesses .",
    "these observations support the general model of the transition proposed on the basis of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and photoelectron diffraction studies @xcite .",
    "the pt(111 ) substrate was prepared by repeated cycles of ar sputtering and annealing at @xmath12 k. the crystal was then exposed to an o@xmath13 partial pressure of @xmath14 mbar at @xmath15 k , in order to catalytically remove the carbon impurities which had segregated from the bulk .",
    "finally , it was annealed at @xmath16 k without o@xmath13 .",
    "the order and cleanliness of the surface were verified by means of leed and arpes .",
    "ag was evaporated from a resistively heated tungsten basket which had been accurately calibrated in previous experiments @xcite .",
    "bi was deposited by electron - beam - assisted evaporation using a commercial efm3 omicron source .",
    "the sample was kept at room temperature ( rt ) during the deposition of both ag and bi . a mild",
    "post - annealing resulted in sharp leed spots .",
    "the deposition order of ag and bi could be reversed without any effect on the crystalline order and the symmetry and the electronic states , as probed respectively by leed and arpes .",
    "arpes spectra were acquired at rt and @xmath17 ev photon energy using a phoibos @xmath18 specs analyzer equipped with a monochromatized gammadata vuv @xmath19 high brightness source .",
    "the ultimate resolutions of the experimental setup are @xmath20 mev ( energy ) and @xmath21 ( angular ) . in the present work , broad @xmath22-range arpes spectra were acquired by a sequential scanning of the polar angle .",
    "the angular step was @xmath23 .",
    "this is superior than the fwhm of the sharpest state measured in the studied interface ( @xmath24  @xmath25 ) .",
    "the corresponding experimental energy resolution was set to around @xmath26 mev . during the stepwise scanning of the polar angle ,",
    "the incidence angle varies from @xmath27 ( at normal emission ) towards normal incidence at higher @xmath22 values .",
    "the hei source is partially polarized ( @xmath28% @xmath29-polarized ) due to two reflections .",
    "the base pressure was in the low @xmath30  mbar range and increased up to @xmath31  mbar during measurements due to he gas leakage from the discharge cavity .",
    "figure 1 summarizes the arpes results for the clean pt(111 ) surface .",

    "the bz boundaries are at @xmath35 @xmath25 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath36 @xmath25 ( @xmath34 ) . both the ce map and the band dispersion are dominated by a state centered at the @xmath37 point and dispersing through e@xmath32 .",
    "it gives rise to a nearly hexagonal fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "the corner of the fs , along @xmath33 , is at @xmath38  @xmath25 , while the fermi crossing along @xmath34 is at @xmath39  @xmath25    hexagonal contours are expected for surface states at the ( 111 ) surfaces of fcc crystals , by contrast with the threefold symmetry of bulk states .",
    "this point is further discussed in section iv .",
    "however the bulk electronic structure of pt does not present a projected gap around @xmath37 that could support a surface state .",
    "indeed , when the photon energy is varied , this state exhibits a weak but finite @xmath40 dispersion , typical of a bulk state .",
    "the hexagonal contour was then tentatively ascribed not to a true surface state , but to a surface resonance associated with the sixth bulk band @xcite .",
    "that suggestion was later supported by a density functional theory ( dft ) calculation that found a state with @xmath41 character and a strong ( @xmath42% ) localization in the surface layer @xcite .",
    "however , it should also be noted that the predicted arpes fs contour , which has a threefold symmetry for a generic photon energy , becomes nearly hexagonal for specific values of h@xmath43 ( ce maps were calculated with the flan software , courtesy of dr .",
    "e. garcia - michel @xcite ) .",
    "the transition from an almost sixfold to a clearly threefold contour may occur by changing h@xmath43 - or , equivalently , the inner potential v@xmath44  by less than @xmath11 ev , so that the observation of a nearly hexagonal shape could be at least partly accidental . in this frame , the inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) , which has been obtained by a sixfold symmetrization ( same procedure followed in ref . ) should be solely considered for a better visualization of the aforementioned surface contour and the sixfold structure closer to @xmath37 which was previously associated with the fifth bulk band @xcite .",
    "the sixfold symmetrization can not be extended to higher @xmath22 values due to the threeefold overall symmetry of the pt(111 ) surface .",
    "two weaker band features are observed at larger wave vectors .",
    "along @xmath45 one crosses e@xmath32 at @xmath46@xmath25 and again at a symmetric point on the opposite side of @xmath47 , while the second has a maximum at @xmath47 .",
    "their dispersion follows the edges of the projected bulk continuum , defined by solid lines in the figure , and may continue as a surface resonance @xcite . along the @xmath34 direction",
    ", there is a strong feature around the @xmath48 point , where previous studies predicted the edge of a bulk projected gap and a relatively flat surface resonance @xcite .",
    "the deposition of silver on the pt(111 ) substrate was monitored by leed and arpes . for @xmath49",
    "ml the leed pattern and the band structure within the range of fig . 1 [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] are essentially identical to those of the clean substrate .",
    "new features appear at the completion of the second ml , namely satellite spots pointing towards a @xmath50 reconstruction , characteristic of the si phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , between @xmath11 ml and @xmath3 ml the arpes intensity map [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] exhibits an ",
    "x - like \" feature just below e@xmath32 centered at the @xmath37 point .",
    "this structure was recently observed in an independent arpes experiment @xcite .",
    "it was attributed to a surface resonance derived from the shockley surface state of pt(111 ) , which is split on both sides of @xmath37 by a large rb - type effect .",
    "this state , which for clean pt(111 ) is located above e@xmath32 in a hybridization gap , moves below e@xmath32 as a result of the interaction with the ag overlayer .",
    "the shape , splitting , binding energy , and also the rather diffuse intensity , all agree with the arpes data for 3 ml from ref . .",
    "the ag(111 ) @xmath51 leed pattern is first seen above @xmath52 ml , and the rb - split band completely disappears above @xmath53  ml . for larger ag coverages the ag(111 )",
    "shockley surface state is observed around @xmath37 [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] .",
    "the deposition of bismuth induces significant changes in the leed and arpes signatures , summarized in fig .",
    "the bi evaporation source was calibrated using the characteristic leed pattern of one ml of bi on a pristine ag ( 111 ) substrate @xcite . a bi coverage of @xmath54  ml yields a sharp @xmath55 leed pattern , irrespective of the thickness of the ag layer , i.e both for the simple @xmath51 ( @xmath56  ml ; @xmath57  ml ) and for the reconstructed @xmath50 ( @xmath58  ml ) pt(111)-ag interface .",
    "the @xmath10 structure is never observed for the bi - free pt(111)@xmath0mlag interface .",
    "as already mentioned , we obtained identical leed and arpes results even when the deposition order of ag and bi was reversed , i.e. when bi was directly evaporated on the pt(111 ) substrate .",
    "further bi evaporation up to @xmath59  ml does not yield any new superstructure , but only results in a progressive deterioration of the @xmath10 pattern .",
    "the data presented in the following refer to @xmath60  ml .",
    "these obervations indicate that the @xmath10 superstructure corresponds to a bi - induced reconstruction where bi most likely floats on top of the ag layer .",
    "bismuth therefore behaves as a surfactant in the layer - by - layer growth of ag on pt(111 ) .",
    "this is not surprising if one considers the well - known surfactant properties of sb @xcite  which is isoelectronic and has a smaller atomic radius  and of pb @xcite , which immediately precedes bi in the periodic table . on the other hand ,",
    "we could never obtain the @xmath8r30@xmath9 pattern typical of the biag@xmath7 surface alloy formed for 1/3 ml bi coverage on the ag(111 ) single crystal surface .",
    "clearly , the strain - induced structural modifications at the pt(111)-ag interface are large enough to modify the chemistry of the topmost ag layer with respect to the pristine ag(111 ) surface . a detailed structural investigation , e.g. by surface x - ray diffraction , and first - principles total energy calculations could clarify this point .",
    "arpes data for the @xmath49  ml case are illustrated in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "figure 4 ( a)@xmath1(d ) are ce intensity maps , covering a range of @xmath22 space similar to that of fig .",
    "1 , for four binding energies between 90 mev and 260 mev . figure 5 ( a ) and ( b ) shows two corresponding energy vs. wave vector intensity plots along the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) high symmetry directions in the surface bz . from a comparison with fig . 1",
    ", one can identify in both figures the pt - derived states , namely the bands crossing e@xmath65 at @xmath66 @xmath25 and at @xmath67 @xmath25 in the @xmath45 direction .",
    "remarkably , the ce contours of the former exhibit a distorted hexagonal shape , with threefold symmetry , rather than the sixfold symmetric shape of clean pt(111 ) reported in ref . and inferred by the results of fig .",
    "1 . in addition of the slightly different photon energy of the two studies ( @xmath68 ev vs. @xmath17 ev )",
    ", we propose other factors which may influence the overall shape of the hexagonal contour .",
    "we speculate that with the formation of the ag+bi overlayer this state has acquired a stronger bulk character .",
    "therefore , it may reflect the threefold symmetry of the bulk in a stronger way .",
    "alternatively , the change in work function  and consequently in the inner potential v@xmath44  could be large enough to spoil the accidental condition at the origin of the apparent sixfold symmetry reported for clean pt(111 ) .",
    "a different possible origin of the threefold modulation might be the interaction of the pt - derived surface resonance with electronic states having a threefold symmetry .",
    "such states will be described in the following .",
    "indeed a further analysis of fig .",
    "4 and 5 reveals electronic states which have no counterpart in the electronic structure of the pt(111 ) substrate or the pt(111)-ag interface .",
    "new ce contours appear centered around @xmath37 .",
    "they evolve from a nearly triangular shape [ fig .",
    "4(a),(b ) ] to three disconnected arcs [ fig .",
    "4(c),(d ) ] with increasing binding energy . their origin must be found in three identical bands upward dispersing from the three equivalent @xmath69 points of the @xmath10 surface bz , and crossing e@xmath65 near @xmath37 .",
    "this speculation is further developed by a phenomenological model in the appendix of the present work .",
    "one of these bands is readily visible along @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively in fig . 5 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the nearly circular ce contours [ fig .",
    "4(d ) ] , which are only partially visible due to arpes matrix elements , indicate that these bands have a nearly free - electron - like character near their origin . at larger wave vectors",
    "they experience a stronger effect of the lattice potential , and the ce contours become hexagonal .",
    "one of them is outlined by the dotted hexagon in fig .",
    "the three bands cross at a binding energy of @xmath18 mev , yielding a triangular contour with strong intensity at the vertices at this energy .",
    "the shallow pocket along @xmath72 is a signature of the intersecting states . at the same time",
    ", band splitting is evidenced above the vertices of the triangular contour in fig .",
    "the splitting demonstrates that the interaction between the corresponding states is non negligible for other wave vectors . in the appendix",
    ", we present a phenomenological model which quantifies the hybridization of these bands .",
    "the new interface states feel the @xmath10 periodicity of the system .",
    "this is appreciated most clearly in fig .",
    "replicas of the three intense crossings around @xmath37 , connected by reciprocal lattice vectors of the superstructure , are seen in the adjacent surface bzs , overlapping the pt - derived states . in summary ,",
    "all electronic states of the ( pt(111)@xmath11  ml ag@xmath1bi@xmath73 system exhibit the threefold rotational symmetry of the ( 111 ) surface of an fcc  lattice .",
    "arpes data for the @xmath74  ml case are illustrated by the ce intensity maps of fig .",
    "6 and by the corresponding energy vs. wave vector intensity plots of fig . 7 .",
    "the pt - derived bands and the interface states discussed above can still be identified , but a new state appears at this coverage .",
    "its ce contour exhibits a sixfold symmetry , most clearly visible in fig .",
    "it overlaps with and partially masks the triangular contour of the 1  ml case .",
    "the dispersion of this new state can be identified in the intensity maps of fig .",
    "7 . in the @xmath70 direction [ fig .",
    "7(a ) ] it has a minimum at the @xmath69 point at a binding energy of @xmath750.5 ev .",
    "along @xmath71 [ fig . 7 ( b ) ]",
    "its fermi level crossing is essentially degenerate with that of the 1  ml state , but its fermi velocity is smaller .",
    "details of the evolution of the bi - induced bands as a function of @xmath76 are illustrated by fig .",
    "the figure presents second - derivative maps of the arpes intensity around the @xmath37 point for 1  ml  @xmath77  5  ml , and at two binding energies ( @xmath78 mev and @xmath79 mev ) .",
    "the data were not symmetrized in order to prevent possible artifacts from the symmetrization procedure . at @xmath49 ml ( left vertical panel ) ,",
    "the ce contours exhibit a clear threefold symmetry .",
    "the possibility that arpes matrix element effects determine the shape of the triangular contour has been ruled out by varying the experimental geometry .",
    "the second vertical panel shows that at @xmath11 ml dominant ( especially at @xmath79 mev ) sixfold contours are superimposed on weaker traces of the triangular contours , as already noticed in fig .",
    "the two contours coexist also at @xmath52 ml , with a more balanced intensity . at @xmath3 ml the sixfold contour is missing and the only bi - induced interface state around @xmath37 has a threefold symmetry . at @xmath20",
    "ml the threefold contour is still visible , but more blurred .",
    "this reflects disorder associated with the formation of three - dimensional ag islands @xcite .",
    "the sequence of images of fig . 8 clearly illustrates the threefold  @xmath80  threefold@xmath81sixfold  @xmath80  threefold evolution of the ce contours , i.e. a re - entrant behavior of the rotational symmetry of the bi - induced interface states as a function of the ag coverage .",
    "the properties of the electronic states in a solid are strongly constrained by symmetry requirements . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry requires that : @xmath82 where the arrows stand for the spin - polarization . in the limit of a vanishing energy separation between the two spin states ,",
    "( [ e1 ] ) reduces to the simpler @xmath83 . in a 2d close - packed system with a sixfold unit cell , irrespective of the magnitude of the spin - separation , a spin - integrated technique such as arpes yield electronic contours of hexagonal in - plane symmetry satisfying ( [ e1 ] ) . even if the 2d system only admits a threefold rotation axis , eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) still requires that the ce contours of the electronic structure exhibit a sixfold symmetry ( [ e1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , as already pointed out , surface states can not exhibit a threefold rotational symmetry , because this would be incompatible with tr symmetry .",
    "unlike surface states , bulk states are characterized by a well - defined perpendicular wave vector @xmath40 , and ( [ e1 ] ) applies to the 3d @xmath84-vector",
    ". the combined effect of ( [ e1 ] ) and of a threefold rotation axis yields a 3d band dispersion with an overall threefold symmetry .",
    "prime examples are the bulk electronic structures of fcc metals @xcite .",
    "arpes is only sensitive to the in - plane component of @xmath84 , and maps the full 3d dispersion onto the surface bz .",
    "therefore , in an arpes measurement from the ( 111 ) surface of an fcc system , the threefold symmetry of the bulk states coexists with the hexagonal surface bz , e.g. for the well - studied case of cu(111 ) @xcite . for values of the surface wave vector outside the projected bulk gaps , there are no true surface states but only surface resonances , which hybridize significantly with the continuum of bulk states . in an fcc system",
    "this typically yields a threefold modulation in their momentum distributions .",
    "this is e.g. the case of the hole pockets at the sb(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "our observation of sixfold ce contours around @xmath11 ml suggests that the crystal structure has also acquired a sixfold symmetry at this coverage .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the scenario of the pt(111)-ag interface developed from structural investigations .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the first monolayer of ag on pt(111 ) grows heteroepitaxially conserving the fcc stacking of the substrate .",
    "the @xmath85% difference in the lattice constants of the two materials yields a coherently strained commensurate overlayer .",
    "strain is relieved with the completion of the second monolayer . at the annealing temperature ( @xmath86 k ) used in the present study , the si phase is formed @xcite .",
    "moreover , at this temperature there is no intermixing between pt and ag atoms @xcite . in the @xmath11  ml si phase , regions with fcc and hcp stacking coexist .",
    "the majority domains have been assigned to hcp stacking both by stm @xcite and photoelectron diffraction @xcite , although an earlier stm study had reported that fcc stacking is dominant @xcite .",
    "both experiments agree that with further ag deposition the fcc stacking of the substrate is resumed , and that the growth is mainly two - dimensional at rt up to a critical thickness of @xmath87 ml @xcite .",
    "the fcc stacking implies a threefold symmetry .",
    "by contrast , the symmetry resulting from the hcp stacking is sixfold .",
    "the wavefunctions of the interface resonances certainly extend into the bulk by at least @xmath52 ml , which is enough to `` feel '' the difference between the two different stacking sequences .",
    "hcp domains exist on the uppermost layers only after the deposition of @xmath11  ml of ag , and this is consistent with our observation of coexisting threefold and sixfold ce contours at this coverage .",
    "as more ag is deposited , the fcc stacking of the uppermost layers is reflected in the electronic structure by the dominance of the ce contour with a triangular shape .",
    "indeed , the orientation of the triangular contour is consistent with the structural reflection symmetry of an fcc slab . therefore , the sequence threefold  @xmath80  threefold@xmath81sixfold  @xmath80  threefold finds a natural explanation in the growth mechanism of ag on pt(111 ) .",
    "in other words , arpes successfully reveals the symmetry of the growth domains and the ag - coverage - dependent transition . following the above line of reasoning ,",
    "our results suggests that hcp sites are the majority domains at @xmath88 ml because they evidence a predominant sixfold symmetry for @xmath89 ml bi on @xmath11 ml ag .",
    "this conclusion is in good agreement with the structural analysis presented in refs . and .",
    "apart from the experimental geometry , arpes matrix element effects can be introduced by the scattering process of the photo - emitted electrons .",
    "these final state effects are the analog of a leed @xmath90 or an x - ray photoelectron diffraction ( xpd ) experiment . in the latter case , the associated modulation of intensity for a core - level photo - electron can be of the order of several tens of % .",
    "this would introduce a threefold intensity modulation for states with different symmetries ( e.g. circular , hexagonal ) .",
    "in the present work , threefold and sixfold contours are rather different and coexist on the same sample for @xmath91 ml ( fig .",
    "8) . there is no sign of interaction of the corresponding states but rather a superposition of their contours .",
    "therefore , they must originate from different domains of the sample , which are naturally attributed to the fcc and hcp domains . in line with these arguments",
    ", a sixfold contour was never evidenced on interfaces with an fcc(111 ) structure ( i.e. @xmath92 ml and @xmath93 ml ) .",
    "concerning the bi atoms , our data suggests that they reside on the topmost layer .",
    "they induce the formation of a long - range reconstruction by preferential ordering at @xmath10 sites , and do not affect the structural symmetry of the underlying pt(111)-ag interface .",
    "nonetheless , further structural meaurements are necessary to fully characterize the pt(111)-ag - bi trilayer .",
    "is there any signature of rb - type splitting on the studied interfaces ?",
    "as discussed in section iii , our results on the bi - free interface are in good agreement with bendounan _",
    "2 evidences the unoccupied surface state of pt(111 ) @xcite which shifts below @xmath94 after ag deposition of @xmath95 ml and presents an enhanced rb splitting .",
    "the latter was attributed to multiple scattering between bulk and surface @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that there is still no alloying after the deposition of bi .",
    "therefore , it is multiple scattering between bulk and surface , rather than a strong in - plane potential gradient who could act as a potential mechanism for a strong rb - splitting of surface states . on the other hand",
    ", the pt(111)-ag surface resonance disappears after bi deposition and is replaced by new electronic states with a finite bulk extension .",
    "the latter do not present any direct evidence of rb splitting .",
    "the experimental data for pt(111)@xmath96 ml ag@xmath1bi is supported by a phenomenological nfe model ( appendix ) where the main band structure features have been reproduced by a spin - free simulation .",
    "the situation is less clear for pt(111)@xmath97 ml ag@xmath1bi where new states appear .",
    "we hope that our results will motivate relativistic _ ab initio _ studies which can readily identify the spin character of the bi - induced states .",
    "we presented a detailed arpes investigation of an ordered pt(111)-ag - bi trilayer system . in the studied ag coverage range",
    "@xmath98  @xmath99  @xmath20 ml we did not observe the expected formation of the biag@xmath7  rashba \" surface alloy with periodicity @xmath8r30@xmath9 , characteristic of the bi - ag interface on a pristine ag(111 ) surface .",
    "we observed instead a novel @xmath55 phase , where the bi atoms most likely float on top of the ag interlayer yielding strong interface states which change with the ag coverage .",
    "the rotational symmetry of their ce contours evolves from threefold , to a superposition of threefold and sixfold , and finally back to threefold .",

    "<S> together with previous scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron diffraction data , these results provide a consistent microscopic description of the coverage - dependent structural transition . </S>"
