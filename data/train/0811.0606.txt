    "one of the simplest types of formulas for vassiliev invariants are so - called gauss diagram formulas .",
    "an invariant is calculated by counting ( with weights ) subdiagrams of a special combinatorial type in a given link diagram .",
    "the simplest example is counting with signs crossings of two link components to get their doubled linking number .",
    "this approach to finite type invariants was successfully and extensively used for invariants of both classical and virtual links ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    as a rule ,",
    "techniques developed for link invariants were usually later applied for 3-manifold invariants using the surgery description of 3-manifolds .",
    "indeed , configuration spaces integrals ( arising from the perturbative chern - simons theory ) and the kontsevich integral were all adjusted and applied for 3-manifold invariants .",
    "surprisingly , the simplest of those  the gauss diagram technique  was not , until now , applied to invariants of 3-manifolds .",
    "we start filling this gap by studying the case of the lowest degree , namely the celebrated casson invariant @xmath5 ( or rather its generalized versions ",
    "the casson - walker invariant @xmath6 and the lescop invariant @xmath7 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath6 is one of the fundamental invariants of rational homology spheres .",
    "the restriction of @xmath8 to the class of integer homology spheres is an integer extension of the rokhlin invariant  @xcite . in the theory of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) it is the simplest @xmath9-valued invariant after @xmath10 .",
    "however , @xmath6 remains in general quite difficult to calculate .",
    "while it is easy to do for a manifold @xmath11 obtained from @xmath2 by integer surgery on a framed knot @xmath12 , the same question for links remains quite complicated , apart from the well - studied simple case of unimodular algebraically split links .",
    "in particular , for 2-component links satisfactory formulas only exist for some special cases  @xcite .",
    "formulas from @xcite , although explicit , were not much applied or studied , possibly due to a large number of terms of various nature and their complicated or cumbersome definitions . while lescop s general formulas for @xmath13 seem to imply all other formulas of @xcite , including also formulas of this paper , we feel that a simple explicit formula remains of a considerable interest .",
    "our approach is elementary , so allows a simple computation of the invariant directly from any integer - framed link diagram and makes many of its properties transparent .",
    "we proceed by the number of components of a given framed link @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is a knot , @xmath4 is closely related to the simplest finite type knot invariant @xmath14  the second coefficient of the alexander - conway polynomial .",
    "so its properties are easy to study knowing the behavior of @xmath14 ; in particular , the gauss diagram formula is well - known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is dedicated to a similar detailed treatment of the 2-component case .",
    "the general @xmath15-component case will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a special case of two component links with zero - framed components was studied in @xcite . while the invariant is described there only by means of its behavior under a self - crossing of one of the components , a gauss diagram formula is in fact implicit there .",
    "we show that their results extend to the case of arbitrary integer framings and provide a simple gauss diagram formula in this general case .",
    "the main ingredient of this formula appeared first in @xcite and is now known as the generalized sato - levine invariant , see @xcite .",
    "the gauss diagram formula enables us to calculate the values of @xmath4 in a simple and straightforward way starting from any diagram of a 2-component link .",
    "our additional goal is to understand and separate the dependence of @xmath4 on the underlying topological type of the link and on the framings .",
    "this is also evident from the formula .",
    "in particular , we observe an interesting asymptotics of the casson - walker invariant as both ( or just one of ) the framings are rescaled and taken to infinity .",
    "it is interesting that in two special cases the asymptotical behavior of @xmath4 turns out to be very different from the general case .",
    "the first case appears when the framing of one of the components is zero .",
    "this could be expected and reflects the fact that the manifold obtained by surgery on this component is not a homology sphere .",
    "another  somewhat more surprising ",
    "special case is when the framings of two components are opposite to each other .",
    "we also deduce a simple skein relation for @xmath6 which relates its change under a crossing change between two components to its values on the smoothed link and the sublinks .",
    "this has interesting implications for the theory of finite type ( or perturbative ) invariants of 3-manifolds .",
    "indeed , this theory is well - studied only for integer homology spheres , and thus was defined only on special classes of surgery links , with a complicated borromean - type modification @xcite playing the role of a crossing change .",
    "the behavior of an invariant under a self - crossing of one of the link components @xmath16 easily fits into the theory ( since it may be obtained by adding a new small 1-framed component going around two strands of @xmath16 near the crossing ) , and thus is well - understood @xcite .",
    "a crossing change between different components , however , changes the homology of the resulting manifold , so does not fit the theory of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds .",
    "our work implies , however , that the relation between finite type invariants of links and 3-manifolds is closer than one could expect and that the behavior of these invariants under such crossing changes may be understood as well .",
    "we remark that while in this paper we usually restrict our consideration to the case when @xmath0 is a rational homology sphere , our formulas are well defined also in case when @xmath0 is not such . in this case",
    "our formula gives the lescop s generalization of the casson - walker invariant .",
    "we sum up the goals of this paper in the following    * problem . *",
    "given a framed 2-component link @xmath17 with the integer linking matrix @xmath18 , we want to    1 .",
    "find simple gauss diagram formulas for @xmath4 ; 2 .",
