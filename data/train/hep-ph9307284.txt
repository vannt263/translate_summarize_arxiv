    "baryon number is violated by nonperturbative effects in the electroweak interaction @xcite . while it is under controversial debate whether this could show up @xcite in high energy laboratory experiments ,",
    "there is a common agreement that this should give important effects at the high temperatures of the early universe @xcite .",
    "indeed the discussion of sphaleron @xcite induced baryon number violation in a heat bath triggered the work on sizeable baryon number violation by the standard interactions .",
    "actually in the hot electroweak phase without higgs vacuum expectation value there is no sphaleron configuration , but still washing out of baryon number is expected if @xmath1 ( which is rather natural in inflationary models without strong reheating ) .",
    "thus we have the difficult problem of explaining baryon number generation @xcite in a first - order electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "even if such a mechanism can be convincingly described , one still has to make sure that the baryon asymmetry generated is not washed out by sphaleron effects directly after the phase transition to the higgs phase . at these temperatures",
    "@xmath2 the effective potential of the theory should already produce a sizeable higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath3 since a strong first order transition is required for baryon number production .",
    "this brings us to the subject of this paper , a discussion of the wash - out by sphalerons with a transition rate @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the gauge coupling and @xmath6 the 3-dimensional sphaleron action .",
    "in the usual perturbative treatment of the effective potential for the higgs field @xmath7",
    "@xcite @xmath8 is directly related to a radiatively generated @xmath9-term .",
    "it also depends on the higgs coupling @xmath0 and hence is sensitive to the higgs mass . requiring the baryon asymmetry not being washed out by the sphaleron effect ( eq .  ( [ 1.1 ] ) ) , an upper bound to the higgs mass",
    "can be derived @xcite .",
    "the rough bound @xmath10 gev is already significantly violated by experiments .",
    "radiative corrections @xcite , the factor in front of eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) , have to be discussed .",
    "if perturbation theory in the effective 3-dimensional gauge coupling is reliable the conclusion remains unaltered that the standard electroweak theory leads to a washing out of a previously generated baryon asymmetry ( if @xmath1 ) after the phase transition . because of the magnitude of the effective coupling , this perturbative expansion is problematic for @xmath11 near @xmath12 close to the phase transition , whereas for smaller values of @xmath11 it is more trustworthy . in any case , nonperturbative effects could be responsible for a stronger first order transition , as suggested by numerical lattice studies @xcite .",
    "if the problem of washing out the baryon asymmetry could be avoided , cp violation might be strong enough to explain the baryon number of the universe even in the standard model with a single doublet @xcite .",
    "otherwise , variants of the standard electroweak theory would have to be considered @xcite .",
    "also in these models , however , a thorough discussion of the baryon number violating rate including radiative effects is necessary if one wants to give quantitative bounds for the higgs mass .",
    "one might doubt whether the perturbative treatment of the effective action in the temperature range close to the phase transition and with field configurations restricted by the sphaleron ansatz is reliable .",
    "there are several dangerous aspects we should shortly mention at the beginning and comment on in more detail later on .",
    "the region around the higgs field @xmath13 has strong infrared effects like those in qcd and one has to inspect how sensitive to this region the sphaleron calculation is . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , infrared divergences due to goldstone bosons also appear for @xmath14 in the selfconsistency ( gap type ) equations if the landau gauge is used .",
    "we do not expect these singularities to be physical .",
    "the sphaleron is a 3-dimensional object , and it is consequent to discuss it with an effective action where the nonzero matsubara frequencies are already integrated out , i.  e. in a 3-dimensional theory for the static modes . in low order perturbation theory , combined with a high temperature expansion",
    "this can be carried out .",
    "the non - static modes are expected to behave perturbatively , except for plasma mass effects , whereas the static ( zero ) modes may show non - perturbative behaviour ( dynamical mass generation , condensate formation , confinement ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the high temperature expansion in integrating the non - static modes .",
    "however , the phase transition may be at temperatures where this is not valid anymore .",
    "it is only partly a matter of convenience which radiative corrections should already be included in the effective action which gives the sphaleron configuration . in principle",
    "one could use `` exact '' renormalization group techniques @xcite to arrive at the appropriate action at some scale , but even the discussion of one - loop corrections to the fundamental lagrangian with the well - known sphaleron gives interesting insights .",
    "the 3-dimensional effective ( dimensionless ) gauge coupling @xmath15 is not very small at the temperatures of the supposed first order phase transition ( but does not diverge as for second - order transitions ) .",
    "this supports the high temperature expansion , but causes problems with the perturbative expansion .",
    "though it would be certainly more satisfying to see all these aspects controlled in a genuinely nonperturbative treatment , a perturbative approach might still give a good orientation .",
    "when this paper was first written @xcite , an exact calculation of the 1-loop sphaleron determinant by carson et al .",
    "@xcite had been available for relatively large values of the higgs mass .",
    "the result apparently differed considerably from the answer one would get in determining the sphaleron using the 1-loop effective potential .",
    "later , baacke and junker @xcite presented another complete calculation of the determinant , with rather different results . in the mean - time , some errors have been corrected , and the use of different schemes has been clarified by these authors @xcite . both exact answers are now essentially consistent , and are furthermore surprisingly well represented up to intermediate higgs masses by the @xmath16 term of the 1-loop effective potential .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite can not directly be used near the electroweak phase transition because the original expansion parameter becomes infinite .",
    "the loop expansion has to be rearranged .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the 1-loop corrections will be estimated using the heat - kernel expansion .",
    "these will be the main subjects of this paper .",
    "chapter 2 contains a discussion of the effective three - dimensional action including the @xmath16-term at temperatures close to the phase transition . in chapter 3",
    "we study the radiative corrections to the baryon number violating transition rate induced by the sphaleron .",
    "the @xmath0 ( higgs mass ) dependence of the different parts of the rate are discussed in detail . using the t hooft - feynman gauge plays an important role .",
    "chapter 4 contains numerical evaluations and a discussion of our results .",
    "the effective action for the sphaleron saddle point @xcite can differ from the fundamental action .",
    "the inclusion of 1-loop effects ( eventually enlarged by the selfconsistent ir plasma mass corrections ) has important effects in temperature quantum field theory , in particular the @xmath17 plasma mass term .",
    "there is also a @xmath2-dependent coupling @xmath18 and there will appear new terms in the action like @xmath19 etc .",
    "if one completely integrates our the nonzero matsubara frequencies .",
    "the latter terms are neglected in the following in the spirit of a high temperature expansion .    after a rescaling    @xmath20    the electroweak standard action ( without weinberg mixing ) including plasma mass and @xmath18 , and reduced to three dimensions can be written as @xcite    @xmath21\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the effective 3-dimensional gauge coupling    @xmath22    and with t - dependent minimum of the potential ( in the notation of ref .",

    "is required and indeed perturbation theory provides us with a term @xmath30 in the effective potential suggesting a first - order phase transition",
    ". this might be as misleading as in the pure @xmath31 theory where the coupling @xmath0 appearing in this term vanishes @xcite at the phase transition .",
    "however , the latter does not happen with the 4-dimensional gauge coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the term above is a zero - mode 3-dimensional ir effect    @xmath32    with @xmath33 for gauge bosons .",
    "there are of course further contributions to the effective action  ( [ 2.2 ] ) , among them a debye mass term    @xmath34    because of this longitudinal gauge boson plasma mass@xmath35 their contribution is suppressed at high temperatures .",
    "there is also a mass counter term depending linearly on the cut - off .",
    "it arises because the 4-dimensional one - loop integrals leave out the static modes and cancel against divergences of the 3-dimensional theory .",
    "thus we include a term @xmath36 in the potential with    @xmath37    where the factor @xmath38 is due to the suppression of the longitudinal gauge boson in eq .",

    "( [ 3.7 ] ) . in a sphaleron background ,",
    "the integrand falls off only power - like with t. these partially summed operators therefore represent a @xmath83-dependence very different from the true large @xmath83 behaviour .",
    "this causes some doubts on whether these contributions separately give a good representation of the complete effective action .    considering high derivative operators one actually finds the t integrand increasing power - like in t , i.  e. the t - integrals diverge , and the derivative expansion actually breaks down for the sphaleron .",
    "the reason is that @xmath124 approaches zero for @xmath125 in the sphaleron background",

    "@xmath0 singularities associated with `` bound states '' in the fluctuation spectrum would only be logarithmic .",

    "stronger @xmath0 singularities can only arise from the small t region and should show up in the heat kernel expansion .",
    "necessary criteria for a well - behaved quasi - classical treatment of sphaleron transitions is that 1-loop terms are small compared to the classical sphaleron action . in the original formulation",
    "this was not the case because the coupling blows up at the critical temperature .",
    "this is cured by redefining the coupling according to the one - loop vacuum expectation value @xmath3 , as outlined in the chapter before .",
    "the question now is whether one - loop terms will be small compared to @xmath138 even at the critical temperature .",
    "singularities in @xmath0 arise because some of the operators appearing in the expansion become singular for @xmath0 going to zero .",

    "the major result of this paper is a systematic treatment of radiative corrections to the sphaleron rate close to the critical temperature where washing - out of a baryon asymmetry would be most severe .",
    "previous studies of radiative corrections do not apply in this temperature range because their effective 3-dimensional gauge coupling diverges at the lower critical temperature , and the whole scheme breaks down ( no matter how small @xmath0 is ) .",
    "this does not mean that sphaleron transitions actually become unsuppressed at @xmath28 , but simply arises from choosing an unfortunate scheme for defining the coupling , not taking into account that we deal with a first order transition .",
    "qualitatively , this is quite obvious .",
    "we have given a systematic framework for doing the quasiclassical expansion in this case .",
    "for @xmath151 there are no problems with a complex perturbative potential . in the t hooft - feynman background gauge all fluctuations including goldstone and higgs fields have positive mass squared for all non - zero @xmath7 ( compare eq .",

    "<S> we discuss one - loop radiative corrections to the sphaleron - induced baryon number - violating transition rate near the electroweak phase transition in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that in the case of a first - order transition a rearrangement of the loop expansion is required close to the transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding expansion parameter , the effective 3-dimensional gauge coupling approaches a finite @xmath0 dependent value at the critical temperature . the @xmath0 ( higgs mass ) dependence of the 1-loop radiative corrections is discussed in the framework of the heat kernel method . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections are small compared to the leading sphaleron contribution as long as the higgs mass is small compared to the w mass . to 1-loop accuracy , there is no higgs mass range compatible with experimental limits where washing - out of a b+l asymmetry could be avoided for the minimal standard model with one higgs doublet . </S>"
