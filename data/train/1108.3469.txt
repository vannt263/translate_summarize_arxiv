    "bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( bscco ) has often been chosen for those mqt studies , because one can easily cleave the crystals with scotch tape to prepare thin and flat crystals .",
    "in fact obtaining thin and flat crystals is the crucial point in the fabrication process to form a small @xmath5-shaped ijj stack either using focused ion beam ( fib ) etching technique@xcite or using double sided cleaving method , i.e. , argon ion etching@xcite .",

    "the quantum fluctuations in phase space are proportional to @xmath6 @xcite ; a josephson junction having larger @xmath6 may let us perform qubit operations at higher temperature .",

    "however an lsco ijj stack can not easily be fabricated since it is difficult to cleave the bulk crystal by scotch tape , unlike bscco .",

    "only a few experimental studies fabricating @xmath5-shaped lsco ijj stacks in bulk crystals have been reported @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use thin films but _ a priori _ this is not a good solution because the grain boundaries can not be neglected@xcite .    in this article ,",
