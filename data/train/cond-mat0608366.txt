    "the problem of noise - activated escape in periodically modulated systems is of interest to many areas of physics and applications , from josephson junctions @xcite and nano- and micromechanical systems @xcite to epidemics @xcite .",
    "the theory of activated escape should answer two closely related questions : what is the escape rate and how does the system move during escape ?",
    "fluctuational trajectories leading to escape or interstate switching are of significant interest and have been extensively studied in recent years using various numerical techniques , see refs . and papers cited therein .",
    "even though escape is a random event , the probabilities of following different paths are strongly different .",
    "therefore most likely the system follows a certain pathway , i.e. , its trajectory is close to the most probable escape path ( mpep ) , see ref .   and references therein",
    ".    the distribution of escape trajectories can be conveniently characterized by the prehistory probability distribution ( ppd ) , a quantity accessible to direct experimental measurements .",
    "it is obtained by recording trajectories of the system that lead to escape and superimposing the trajectories that , after the system has escaped , pass through a small vicinity of a point @xmath0 ( for a certain modulation phase , in the case of a periodically modulated system ) .",
    "the point @xmath0 is chosen in the phase space sufficiently far behind the boundary of the basin of attraction to the initially occupied metastable state .",
    "formally , the ppd @xmath1 is the probability density for the system to have passed through a point @xmath2 at an instant @xmath3 provided it had been fluctuating about the metastable state for a long time and passed @xmath0 at a later time @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the ppd @xmath1 should peak at @xmath2 lying on the optimal fluctuational path that leads to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it `` maps out '' optimal paths . for stationary systems",
    "this has been directly confirmed by extensive simulations @xcite and also in laser experiments @xcite . in such systems",
    "escape can occur at any time , with equal probability , therefore the tube of paths around the optimal escape path is broad .    in the present paper we study",
    "escape pathways in periodically modulated systems .",
    "modulation synchronizes escape events .",
    "this can be easily understood for escape from a slowly modulated potential well . here",
    ", escape is most likely to occur when the instantaneous potential barrier @xmath6 is at its lowest , once per period , cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme](a ) .",
    "if the modulation amplitude of @xmath7 significantly exceeds the noise intensity @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for thermal noise ) , escape events are synchronized very strongly .",
    "strong synchronization persists even where the modulation is not slow and the adiabatic picture in which the escape rate is determined by the instantaneous barrier height does not apply @xcite . as a result of escape synchronization , there is one mpep per period .    in turn , as we show , the prehistory probability distribution displays a sharp narrow peak as a function of @xmath2 for a given @xmath3 .",
    "this peak lies on the mpep . respectively , in @xmath10 space the ppd displays a narrow ridge centered at the mpep , cf .",
    "[ fig:3d ] .",
    "moreover , the ppd may have several narrow peaks [ ridges in @xmath10 space ] .",
    "their width gives the width of the distribution of escape trajectories .",
    "it is determined by the typical diffusion length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the relaxation time of the system .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the shape of the ppd in stationary systems @xcite .",
    "of course , in modulated systems along with the final point @xmath0 through which the system passes one should fix the modulation phase when the passage happens .",
    "it is given by the passage time @xmath4(mod @xmath13 ) , where @xmath13 is the modulation period .",
    "the occurrence of a narrow peak of the escape trajectories distribution can be understood from the qualitative picture of motion in escape .",
    "this picture is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] for a system with one dynamical variable @xmath2 .",
    "escape from a static potential well corresponds to going over the barrier top @xmath14 from the vicinity of the potential minimum @xmath15 , see fig .",

    "[ fig : scheme ] . here , for small noise intensity the system moves close to the noise - free trajectory from the vicinity of @xmath16 to @xmath0 .",
    "in the case of a static potential this corresponds to sliding down the potential slope from @xmath14 to @xmath0 .",
    "section b corresponds to diffusion in a region of width @xmath20 around @xmath16 . in this region",
    "noise - free motion with respect to @xmath16 is slow ( in the case of a static potential the potential is locally flat at @xmath14 ) .",
    "section c corresponds to motion from the attractor to the basin boundary .",
    "the respective trajectory is close to the most probable escape path .",
    "this motion is a result of the large fluctuation that has led to escape detected at @xmath0 . for strongly synchronized escape ,",
    "there is one mpep per modulation period , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) .",
    "the mpep approaches @xmath16",
    "asymptotically as @xmath21 .",
    "if the system was observed behind @xmath22 at time @xmath4 , it has most likely arrived to the vicinity of @xmath16 along the mpep that approached @xmath16 before @xmath4 , but not too much in advance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) . finally in the region d well before @xmath4 the system was fluctuating about the attractor .",
    "the above picture suggests that the ppd will peak on the trajectory singled out in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "it also explains why the ppd peak along @xmath2 axis should be narrow : in contrast to stationary systems , which can arrive to the vicinity of @xmath14 at any time , periodically modulated systems approach @xmath16 only once per period , and the tube of escape trajectories is narrow .",
    "we note that , by changing @xmath23 , we can switch between neighboring mpep s , and therefore there is a possibility for the ppd to have two and potentially even more peaks inside the attraction basin .",
    "as mentioned above , we are interested in the regime where escape events are strongly synchronized by the modulation .",
    "it means that the probability density to find the escaped system at a point @xmath0 behind the basin boundary , cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , displays sharp peaks as a function of the observation time @xmath4 .",
    "these peaks are periodically repeated in time .",
    "they were studied in ref .  .",
    "we will analyze the ppd for the time @xmath4 close to the maximum of the escape probability peak .",
    "this choice is justified , because the corresponding ppd characterizes the most probable escape trajectories .",
    "otherwise the ppd would be formed by trajectories with exponentially smaller probabilities that are very rarely followed in escape .",
    "interestingly , the condition that the tubes of escape trajectories be narrow in time and space requires that the modulation frequency @xmath24 lie within a range limited both from below and from above . to understand the lower limit we note that , as mentioned above , for slow modulation escape occurs every period around the time @xmath25 where the height of the instantaneous potential barrier @xmath6 is at its minimum ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the typical width of the time window for escape @xmath27 is given by the condition @xmath28 , which leads to @xmath29^{1/2}\\sim\\omega_f^{-1}[d/\\delta u(t_{\\rm m})]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath27 exceeds the typical duration of motion in escape @xmath30 $ ] , the ppd has the same shape as if the system were escaping out of a stationary potential well of height @xmath31 . in this case inside the attraction basin the ridge of the ppd in @xmath10 space is broad and asymmetric , its width along @xmath2 axis is independent of the noise intensity @xcite .    in the opposite limit of high - frequency modulation , @xmath32 , escape of an overdamped system is not synchronized .",
    "the dynamics is characterized by the coordinates averaged over modulation period .",
    "the ppd as a function of such coordinates is described by the theory for stationary systems @xcite , and the ppd peak inside the attraction basin is broad .    in the intermediate range of frequencies",
    "not only are the ppd peaks narrow but , as mentioned above , the ppd as a function of @xmath2 for given @xmath3 ( and also of @xmath3 for given @xmath2 ) may display several peaks inside the attraction basin .",
    "this happens because the motion of the system near the basin boundary is slow .",
    "therefore if the system is observed behind the boundary @xmath16 at a given time @xmath4 , it could have arrived to the boundary along one of a few periodically repeated optimal escape paths , fluctuated about @xmath16 for some time , and then made a transition to @xmath33 over time @xmath34 .",
    "the multiple - peak structure of the ppd is a specific feature of periodically modulated systems far from equilibrium , i.e. away from both the adiabatic limit of slow modulation and the limit of fast modulation .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] for a model system .",
    "two ridges of the ppd inside the attraction basin are clearly resolved in this figure .",
    "their shape is well described by the asymptotic theory developed in this paper .     and its contour plot for a noise - driven overdamped system with equation of motion @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is white noise of intensity @xmath8 .",

    "the amplitudes of different peaks of the ppd [ heights of the ridges in @xmath10 space ] differ from each other significantly , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : peak_amplitudes ] ) and figs .  [ fig:3d ] , [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "these amplitudes are sensitive to the choice of @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the positions and shapes of the ppd peaks very weakly depend on @xmath33 .",
    "this shows that the ppd provides a means for studying the distribution of trajectories leading to escape .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical simulations of escape for a model brownian particle in a modulated potential well .",
    "the simulations confirm the possibility to clearly observe most probable escape paths .",
    "they are in a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the analytical theory .",
    "observing most probable escape paths is not only interesting on its own , but also has broader implications .",
    "first , periodically modulated systems are an important class of systems far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "in contrast to the case of equilibrium systems , optimal fluctuational paths in nonequilibrium systems have no immediate relation to dynamical trajectories in the absence of noise ; in particular , they may not be obtained by just reversing time .",
    "the mpep s can display interesting and counterintuitive behavior @xcite , and studying them provides an insight into general features of dynamics away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "second , understanding the dynamics of a system in escape paves the way for efficient control of this dynamics and the escape probability itself ; as will be discussed in a separate publication , such control can be accomplished by comparatively weak field pulses applied in the right place and at the right time .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results of this paper suggest a way of direct observation of most probable escape paths , in space and time .",
    "they also describe , qualitatively and quantitatively , the distribution of the trajectories followed in escape .",
    "this research has been supported in part by the nsf grant no . dmr-0305746 ."
