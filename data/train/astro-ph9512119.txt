    "the origin of ray bursts is still unknown and is currently the subject of a `` great debate '' in the astronomical community .",
    "do the bursts have a galactic origin @xcite  or are they cosmological @xcite ? and what is their distance scale ?    in this paper ,",
    "i do not attempt to answer the first question , but rather , i show that _ if _ one assumes that ray bursts are cosmological in origin , one can begin to answer the second question and place a constraint on the distance scale to the bursts .",
    "this is because cosmological bursts are expected to trace the large  scale structure of luminous matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "the constraint comes from comparing the _ expected _ clustering pattern of bursts on the sky  which will depend on their distance scale because of projection effects  with that _ actually observed_. the observed angular distribution is in fact quite isotropic @xcite ; hence , only a lower limit to the distance scale can be placed because a sufficiently large distance will always lead to a sufficiently isotropic distribution on the sky .    here",
    "i use a powerful new likelihood method @xcite , which i had previously developed to analyze repeating of ray bursts in the batse 1b and 2b catalogs @xcite , to compare the observed counts  in  cells distribution in the new batse 3b catalog @xcite  with that expected for bursts at cosmological distances .    here",
    "i will assume for simplicity that @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and that the large  scale structure clustering pattern is constant in comoving coordinates .",
    "the results are in fact insensitive to these assumptions because of the small redshifts that are involved .",
    "i follow the usual convention and take @xmath7 to be the hubble constant in units of 100 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a large number of circular cells , each centered on a random position on the sky .",
    "each cell is of fixed solid angle size @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angular radius of the cell .",
    "i set the number of cells to be such that any part of the sky is covered , on average , by one cell ; hence , @xmath12 . let @xmath13 to be the number of these cells having @xmath14 ray bursts in them , out of the @xmath15 in the batse 3b catalog , where @xmath16 i then define the observed counts  in  cells distribution , @xmath17 , as the probability that a randomly chosen cell of size @xmath18 has @xmath14 bursts in it .",
    "the counts  in  cells distribution contains information about clustering of ray bursts on scales comparable to the angular size @xmath11 of the cell .",
    "i now define @xmath19 to be the counts  in  cells distribution that is expected if ray bursts are cosmological in origin and trace the large  scale structure of luminous matter in the universe .",
    "this expected distribution depends on only one unknown parameter , the effective distance @xmath20 to ray bursts ( which i define below ) , because the angular clustering pattern of bursts on the sky will depend by projection on this distance .",
    "the _ likelihood _ @xmath21 measures how likely it is that the observed counts  in  cells distribution @xmath22 is drawn from the expected distribution @xmath19 . since @xmath19 depends on the unknown effective distance @xmath20 to ray bursts , the likelihood is really a measure of how likely a given value of @xmath20 is .",
    "i find that @xcite : @xmath23    now the cumulative @xmath24 distribution of ray bursts seen by batse begins to roll over from a @xmath25 power ",
    "law for bursts fainter than @xmath26 .",
    "since this is many times above threshold , it suggests that batse sees most of the source distribution and that this distribution is not spatially homogeneous @xcite .",
    "i define @xmath20 as the comoving distance beyond which the source density drops appreciably .",
    "it is not the distance to the very dimmest burst in the batse catalog , but rather the typical distance to most of the dim bursts in the sample ; thus , @xmath20 is the _ effective distance _ to the `` edge '' of the source distribution in the batse catalog .",
    "i take the power spectrum which characterizes the large ",
    "scale clustering of ray burst sources to be the same as that determined from a redshift survey of radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "this power spectrum is characteristic of moderately rich environments , and is intermediate between that of ordinary galaxies and clusters .",
    "because the exact bias factor relating the clustering of ray burst sources to that of luminous matter is unknown , such an intermediate ansatz is reasonable . in any case",
    ", the resultant distance limit depends only weakly on the bias factor ( roughly as the square root ) .",
    "knowledge of the power spectrum permits a calculation of the expected angular clustering pattern , the expected counts  in  cells distribution @xmath19 , and finally the likelihood @xmath27 [ from equation ( 1 ) ] , all as a function of the effective distance @xmath20 to ray bursts @xcite .",
    "i have included the smearing due to finite positional errors on the clustering on small scales @xcite .",
    "indeed , each burst in the batse catalog is assigned a positional uncertainty @xmath28 corresponding to a @xmath29 confidence that the true burst position is within an angle @xmath28 to the position listed in the catalog .",
    "i have chosen the cell size @xmath11 in order to maximize the sensitivity of detection , or signal  to  noise , given the strength of the signal expected . for a sample of 1122 bursts ( the total number of bursts in the batse 3b catalog ) with positional smearing of @xmath30 ( the median value in the 3b catalog ) , the signal  to  noise is maximized when",
    "cells of @xmath31 are used @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the likelihood of the batse 3b catalog data as a function of the effective comoving distance @xmath20 , calculated using cells of size @xmath31 .",
    "the likelihood is normalized to that expected for an isotropic distribution on the sky . at large values of @xmath20 ( the maximum value allowed is @xmath32 mpc , the size of the horizon in a closed universe )",
    ", the likelihood goes to unity , because by projection a sufficiently large distance will always lead to an isotropic distribution on the sky .",
    "note also that there is no value of @xmath20 for which the likelihood is greater than 1 ; thus , the maximum likelihood value for @xmath20 is @xmath33 and the 3b data are consistent with isotropy .    the solid line in fig .",
    "1 shows the likelihood for a positional smearing of @xmath30 , corresponding to the median value in the 3b catalog . to illustrate the dependence of these results on positional errors ,",
    "i also show ( dashed line ) the results for a larger positional smearing value quoted in the 3b catalog .",
    "their best  fit model gives a median positional error of @xmath34 .",
    "] of @xmath35 ( with cells of size @xmath36 to maximize signal  to  noise ) .",
    "small values of the effective comoving distance to ray bursts are unlikely , according to fig .",
    "1 : i find , at the 95% confidence level , that for the 3b median positional error of @xmath30 , @xmath20 must be greater than @xmath0 mpc , corresponding to a redshift @xmath1 .",
    "if the positional errors are larger than quoted and are better characterized by @xmath35 , these results are only slightly weakened : at the 95% confidence level , @xmath20 must be greater than @xmath37 mpc , corresponding to a redshift @xmath38 .",
    "these limits are not sensitive to earlier assumptions on cosmology and clustering evolution since these only become important at higher redshifts . they are also conservative limits in that a constant median value for the positional errors was used , rather than the entire distribution of errors .",
    "this is because the bright bursts , which ostensibly are nearer to us , are more clustered and are responsible for the bulk of the expected signal , but in fact have smaller errors than the median value .",
    "the faint bursts , which are far away , are hardly clustered to begin with ( even before smearing ) , but have errors larger than the median value .",
    "hence the expected clustering pattern has been smeared more by using a constant median value ( this permits a simpler calculation ) than by smearing using the entire distribution of errors . so the counts  in  cells statistic has been weakened somewhat and thus the quoted lower limits are in fact conservative .",
    "if ray bursts are cosmological and trace the large  scale structure of luminous matter in the universe , and their positional errors are as quoted in the 3b catalog , then the lack of any angular clustering in the data implies that the observed distance to the `` edge '' of the burst distribution must be farther than @xmath0 mpc .",
    "since there are 1122 bursts in the catalog , an effective limit on the _ nearest _ burst to us can be placed by convoluting the likelihood as a function of @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "1 ) with the nearest neighbor distribution of 1122 bursts inside a sphere of radius @xmath20 .",
    "i find that the nearest burst must be farther than @xmath2 mpc at the 95% confidence level , and farther than @xmath39 mpc at the 99.9% level . at this level of confidence , then , none of the bursts that have been observed by batse are in nearby galaxies . a signature from the coma cluster or the `` great wall '' ( @xmath40 mpc ) is not likely to be seen in the data at present , since only a few bursts could have originated from these distances .",
    "the median distance to the nearest burst is @xmath3 mpc .",
    "since the brightest burst in the 3b catalog has a fluence of @xmath41 in rays , this implies that the total energy released in rays during a burst event is of order @xmath4 erg .",
    "as the number of observed ray bursts keeps increasing , the distance limit will improve .",
    "in fact , with 3000 burst locations , the clustering of bursts might just be detectable @xcite   and would provide compelling evidence for a cosmological origin . if it is not detected , the redshift to the `` edge '' of the burst distribution would be put at @xmath42 or beyond .",
    "i would like to acknowledge useful discussions with carlo graziani , don lamb , cole miller and bob nichol .",
