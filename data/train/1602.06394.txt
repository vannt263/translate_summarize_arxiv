    "we consider a geometric , non - local pde to model the shape evolution of mm - sized grains typically formed in shallow tropical seas called _ ooids _ in geosciences .",
    "shape evolution of particles is widely investigated both in the mathematical and in the geoscientific literature ( e.g. @xcite and the citations therein ) .",
    "most of the treated models are local ones , i.e. the evolution is determined by some pointwise law , for instance the _ curve - shortening flow _",
    "@xcite is a good example for such a model in two spatial dimensions . having a",
    "strictly inward flow a steady state solution can be considered via some rescaling ( like fixing the area or the arch - length of the curve ) @xcite .",
    "another way of investigating some particular shapes is to track the flow in the backward infinite time limit @xcite . in case the direction of the flow",
    "is not prescribed _ a - priori _ , i.e shrinkage or growth either take effect during the evolution , one may inquire about the existence ( and some properties ) of a bounded ( finite ) _ steady state _ shape . regarding the proposed model we address such a question .    the model investigated in this paper grabs the three crucial physical effects of ooid - growth : a chemical process leading to radial accumulation of material , abrasion of the grain due to collisions to the seabed and finally sliding ( friction ) which takes effect at shallow shores , which landform is widely anticipated as the principal venue for ooid formation .",
    "while the velocity of growth is independent of the size the particle , abrasion and friction both governed by mass - dependent laws . whence the material quantity in the particle can not be omitted from a realistic model ; it should be a _",
    "non - local _ one . in this paper",
    "we focus on two spatial dimensions , non - locality manifests as an area - dependent speed of contraction .",
    "this paper is devoted to the rigorous investigation of the existence and uniqueness of steady state solutions of the model in @xmath0 establishing further work aiming to compare model predictions against observable shapes in nature .",
    "shape evolution might be interpreted as a process that moves any point of a closed , non - self - intersecting curve @xmath1 embedded in @xmath0 to the normal direction with a velocity depending on some physical features of the environment . in our model the evolution of @xmath1 is defined via @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the - time dependent - area enclosed by @xmath1 and the @xmath4 subscript refers to differentiation respect to time .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for the curvature and the unit ( inward directed ) normal of the curve at time @xmath4 , respectively . without loss of generality",
    "we assume the curve possesses a unique maximal diameter ( line @xmath7 between points p and p in fig .",

    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive real parameters of the problem associated with the physical environment and they are assumed to be time - independent during the evolution .",
    "the three key physical components of the proposed model can be easily identified : in the brackets the first , negative term stands for the _ growing _ of the particle , in the second term _",
    "abrasion _ is assumed to be a curvature - driven process and finally the affine term is associated with _ friction_. as the right - hand side of eq .",

    "in specific , we seek shapes that fulfill @xmath14    whole along the curve @xmath1 .",
    "note , that the steady state shape is independent of @xmath12 as it scales solely the time and can not be reconstructed by pure observation of @xmath13 . in",
    "further work we intend to investigate the question , whether the parameter pair @xmath15 can be reproduced just from the observation of a steady state shape ( in case it exists ) ? in this paper we demonstrate , that among smooth , convex curves any steady state shape must possess d2 symmetry and for a given parameter pair @xmath15 this shape is unique , thus the answer for the question is positive .",

    "( [ eq : geom_pde ] ) are uniquely determined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and for any positive values of the two parameters there exists a @xmath13 curve .",

    "for a moment let us assume that the area of the invariant curve is known _ a - priori_. as we investigate smooth , closed curves without self - intersections the derivation can be substantially simplified ( without loss of generality ) by considering solely the curve segment @xmath18 between the leftmost point p and the one that possesses a horizontal tangent and a positive @xmath19 coordinate .",
    "this latest is point q. in order to simplify the derivations we use several parametrizations of the curve segment in the sequel : the _ natural _ parametrization respect to the arc length , the parametrization respect to the @xmath19 coordinate and finally the parametrization respect to the @xmath9 inclination of the tangent of the curve .    in this section",

    "a convenient notation is defined via @xmath22 and @xmath23 which renders eq .",
    "( [ eq : local_01 ] ) to @xmath24    we aim to rewrite this equation to make it solely depend on @xmath25 and its derivatives .",

    "( nonetheless , an ode with @xmath26 as the unknown function can be obtained as well . )    for a moment we reconsider the natural parametrization of the curve .",
    "as we investigate two , arbitrary close points along the curve , by the chain rule we derive the following expression between @xmath5 and @xmath9 ( using the fact , that the derivative of the slope respect to the arch length equals the curvature ) : @xmath27    note , that the negative sign relates to the fact , that by definition @xmath25 is decreasing between points p and q ( fig .",

    "formal substitution verifies that this expression up to the arbitrary constant @xmath32 solves the local equation . in this text",
    "we focus on smooth curves with @xmath33 at point p , which restricts @xmath34 .",

    "substitution of the solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma(delta ) ] ) into the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : de_kappa_gamma ] ) yields @xmath36    this is the unique solution of the local equation , it can be demonstrated by a routine technique ( i.e. demonstrating contradiction from the assumption about another solution which is not given by ( [ eq : kappa(delta ) ] ) ) .",
    "detailed investigation of the properties of @xmath26 is needed for further development as these govern properties of the steady state solutions .",
    "first we carry out a convenient change of parameters via @xmath37    whence the solution ( keeping @xmath34 ) in ( [ eq : kappa(delta ) ] ) can be reformulated as @xmath38    the following properties of @xmath26 can be settled ( proof is provided in the appendix ) :    1 .   @xmath26 is real ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is continuous .",
    "@xmath40 is positive and equals @xmath41 .",

    "there is no local extrema for @xmath26 between @xmath47 , thus it is monotonic in this range .    to realize a steady state shape",
    "@xmath13 we need @xmath25 itself . by the virtue of ( [ eq : de_kappa_gamma ] ) @xmath25",

    "@xmath51 and @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) determine a unique steady state solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : local_02 ] ) , we aim to determine the parameter range , where the curve associated with the solution in smooth . apparently ,",
    "if the area under @xmath26 between @xmath53 exceeds 1 , then we can construct a smooth shape : at the unique @xmath54 the area below @xmath26 equals 1 , i.e. this corresponds to point q with a tangent parallel to the axis @xmath8 . for @xmath55",
    "the connection between @xmath9 and @xmath19 is one to one , thus we can draw the _ physical realization_. for cases , at which the area below @xmath26 is smaller than 1 , the physical shapes are non - smooth ( in fact , they become concave as the curvature flips sign above @xmath45 and there is no other zero for @xmath26 ) . as we have seen , @xmath40 depends solely on @xmath51 and for fixed @xmath46 the value of @xmath45 is fixed , too .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that for any fixed @xmath46 there exist a @xmath56 critical value at which @xmath57    for further convenience for a fixed @xmath46 we define the set @xmath58    it follows , that for @xmath59 the integral on the left - hand - side of ( [ eq_kappa_int_1 ] ) is smaller than one which means the associated curve can not have a horizontal tangent at any point . having assumed convex , smooth curves this parameter - range is not in our interest . in case @xmath60 the integral on the left - hand side is bigger than 1 thus the shape can be realized . as @xmath19 provides a possible parametrization of the curve segment @xmath61 , the unique closed form solution in ( [ eq : gamma(delta ) ] ) can be realized as a unique curve in @xmath0 .",
    "finally we prove uniqueness for @xmath62 itself .",
    "so far we know that for a proper @xmath51 and @xmath52 the curve segment @xmath63 is uniquely determined .",
    "note , that @xmath63 has vertical tangent at p and horizontal tangent at q. as we consider smooth shapes the only way to glue the @xmath63 curve - segments to form a closed , non - intersecting curve is reflection along the @xmath8 and @xmath19 axes .",
    "it clearly hints to that a smooth steady state shape must possess d2 symmetry .",
    "it is worthy to remark that for @xmath64 we have @xmath65 implying that in this case the steady state shape is a circle .",
    "as the term of friction ( the one with parameter @xmath52 ) represents an affine flow , a first intuition says that the steady state curve should be an ellipse . in the appendix",
    "we show that this is not the case , ellipses are not steady state as long as @xmath52 is strictly positive .",

    "exists such a solution , measure the @xmath3 area enclosed by the curve .",
    "it simply leads to the parameters of the non - local equation via @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the other way round ,",
    "if one knows a steady state solution of the non - local equation , calculation of the parameters in the local is straightforward .",
    "these observations imply that a smooth solution of the non - local case must possess d2 symmetry as well and it completes the proof . in the next section",
    "we investigate the connection between the local and non - local models via the relations between their parameters .",
    "we turn to investigate steady state solutions of the non - local equation ( [ eq : steady_state ] ) . as we found that they possess d2 symmetry , we keep investigating a curve segment @xmath18 ( c.f . figure 1 . ) . to investigate uniqueness of solutions in ( [ eq : steady_state ] ) let us assign @xmath68 and @xmath15 if they result in an identical curve as a steady state solution of the proper model ( i.e. ( i.e. it fulfills [ eq : local_03 ] ) in case @xmath68 and ( [ eq : steady_state ] ) in case @xmath15 ) .",
    "in this sense we can talk about a _",

    "as @xmath25 is monotonic along @xmath18 , the position of the two points is well - defined . as we have seen in the previous section @xmath26 and @xmath25",

    "we conclude , that @xmath89    we switch to the parametrization of @xmath18 respect to the tangent direction @xmath9 . based on eq .",

    "this proves that @xmath71 is injective , as different elements in @xmath75 can not be mapped to an identical value in @xmath97 .",
    "it is also worthy to note , that for all @xmath70 the area is obviously positive thus @xmath74 is a positive , monotonic , continuous function .      to prove surjectivity we has to investigate the limits of @xmath74 as @xmath51 is varied .",
    "first we turn to investigate the limit as @xmath98 ( @xmath46 is still fixed ) . from the previous section we know , that the curvature at point p ( @xmath40 ) is maximal along @xmath18 and @xmath99 .",
    "curvature of any planar curve is the reciprocal of the @xmath100 radius of its osculating circle .",
    "it provides an estimate on the area under the curve via @xmath101 . in a similar way we use the fact , that the curvature is minimal at point q ( and there @xmath102 as well ) to obtain the following inequality : @xmath103    as both the lower and the upper expression in the above inequality approach @xmath104 as @xmath98 we conclude @xmath105",
    "finally we investigate the @xmath106 limit .",
    "as @xmath107 is finite it is enough to investigate the @xmath108 area in the limit .",
    "we consider the already used identity between the curvature and and arch length .",
    "taking again the parametrization respect to @xmath9 we write @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the arch length between point p and the point with tangent inclination @xmath9 .",
    "as at @xmath111 the curvature at point q vanish we conclude , that @xmath112    thus the curve is unbounded .",
    "as the area @xmath90 under @xmath18 can be computed from the arc length ( @xmath19 is finite ! ) we conclude @xmath113    which provides the required limit as @xmath114    it means , the range of @xmath71 is indeed @xmath97 and based on the injectivity part of the proof the preimage is precisely @xmath75 . as f is injective and surjective",
    "we conclude that it must be _ one - to - one and onto_. this means , the global equation has a unique solution among smooth curves for any positive @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    practical application of the results presented here and comparison of predicted steady state curves against observable shapes in nature will be carried out in a separate paper .",
    "i thank gbor domokos for his idea to investigate the model presented in the paper and the fruitful discussions about ooids .",
    "due to the @xmath19 dependence of the friction term ( the one multiplied by @xmath11 ) for @xmath17 our natural expectation is to have ellipses as invariant shapes .",
    "we show that this is not the case .",
    "first let us investigate the @xmath115 case when @xmath116    holds , thus @xmath117 for all point of @xmath1 .",
