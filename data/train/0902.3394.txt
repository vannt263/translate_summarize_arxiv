    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) , their engineering applications at liquid nitrogen temperatures have drawn much attention .",
    "the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) is one of the promising htscs materials for various technical applications .",
    "however , in ceramic materials the critical current density ( @xmath10 ) is , due to the weak link effects , very low , rendering them unsuitable for applications . in order to enhance @xmath10 , the so - called melt - textured growth ( mg ) process",
    "@xcite has been developed , which can significantly enhance @xmath10 .",
    "one interesting phenomenon in the mg htscs is the fishtail effect ( fe ) in @xmath10 as well as in isothermal magnetic hysteresis loops ( @xmath11 curves ) @xcite . as for the fe origin",
    ", some researchers propose the vortex ordered phase to disordered phase transition @xcite to explain this interesting phenomenon , while others attribute it to the bulk pinning @xcite . in the vortex phase transition explanation ,",
    "the fe exists both on a single @xmath12 curve and on a single @xmath13 curve .",
    "however , in the bulk pinning explanation , the fe appears on @xmath11 curves whereas on a single magnetization vs. temperature @xmath14 curve it is seldom reported . in the previous work , the critical state model is used to study the isothermal @xmath11 curves @xcite .",
    "however , for htscs , due to their operation at higher temperatures and due to their small activation energy @xmath15 , the flux creep is significant .",
    "hence , non - linear flux creep models were developed .",
    "meanwhile , the surface barrier @xcite , which prevents vortex entering ( @xmath16 ) and exiting ( @xmath17 ) superconductors , has strong effects on the irreversibility of htscs .",
    "the goal of this work was to contribute to the understanding of the fe origin in terms of significant influence of both bulk pinning and surface barriers .",
    "mg samples yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 and yba@xmath1cu@xmath4ag@xmath5o@xmath3 were grown as was described in @xcite .",
    "two samples , pure crystal ( s1 ) and ag - doped crystal ( s2 ) , were used in the present work .",

    "the field sweep rate was @xmath21  t / min . to obtain an additional parameter @xmath22",
    "the resistivity @xmath23 curves were measured on two samples ( the first one is pure and the second one is ag - doped ) which were obtained from the same single - domain bulks as s1 and s2 .",
    "transport measurements were performed using a physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the experiment was divided into two steps .",
    "@xmath11 curves were measured : a ) right after annealing of samples in oxygen ( during 240 hours at 400@xmath24c ) ; b ) after long - term aging at the room temperature ( six months ) , in which case almost all relaxation processes were finished .",
    "the first value for @xmath25 in table  [ tab:1 ] corresponds to a ) and the second value corresponds to b ) .",
    "from the measured @xmath11 curves the critical current density was calculated using the critical state model @xcite that have been developed in @xcite : @xmath26    where @xmath27 ( @xmath280 , @xmath290 are the values of magnetic moment at field @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the density of sample , a , b and c are geometric dimensions of sample .",
    "dependences @xmath13 ( fig .  [ fig:1]a for @xmath32=70  k ) were calculated for the field range 0  t@xmath206  t. to obtain the exact position of maximum on @xmath13 curves the derivative @xmath18 was calculated for each temperature ( see example at fig .  [",
    "fig:1]b ) .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows positions of both minimum ( point a ) and maximum ( point b ) on j vs h curve , where derivative @xmath330 .",

    "[ fig:3 ] shows the temperature dependences @xmath12 , on which fe appears .",
    "however , according to @xcite , fe appears not due to the order - disorder phase transition of vortex lattice .",
    "the possible reason of the fe existence is a significant influence of both bulk pinning and surface barriers @xcite . from the model in previous chapter",
    "the @xmath37 dependences of @xmath36 were obtained ( see fig .",

    "temperature - field dependences of @xmath36-position for samples s1 ( green lines ) and s2 ( blue lines ) , right after annealing ( curves 1,2 ) and after long - term aging ( curves 3,4),width=307 ]    as one can see from table  [ tab:1 ] the value of the critical temperature @xmath25 for sample s1 changed from 90.2  k to 89.8  k and for sample s2 changed from 91.3  k to 91.1  k. this indicates the optimal oxygen annealing process and aging effects are not caused by changing in @xmath38 ( especially for sample s2 ) . according to the estimations performed in @xcite the surface barriers are more important at high temperatures while the bulk pining is more important at low temperatures .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the position of @xmath36 significantly evolves after long - term aging .",
    "the maximum field @xmath9 for sample s1 decreases from 4.25  t to 3.8  t and the minimum temperature @xmath39 increases from 37.5  k to 48  k ( curves 1 and 3 in fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "such changes can be induced by the redistribution of pinning centers in the crystal or , in another words , bulk pinning changes during aging .",
    "constancy of the maximum temperature @xmath40 for s1 corresponds to the influence of surface barriers at high temperatures .",
    "the aging effect for sample s2 is not so significant as for s1 .",
    "it is related to the presence of considerable mechanical tensions in the sample ( large value of an additional parameter @xmath411.5  k ) that prevent the redistribution of pinning centers .",
    "larger value of @xmath9 ( for s2 as compared with s1 ) corresponds to the presence of additional pinning centers on silver atoms @xcite .",
    "a possible reason of the decrease of @xmath9 and increase of @xmath39 for s1 is the decreasing number of dislocations . in another words ,",
    "the crystal s1 becomes more homogeneous after aging .",
    "in summary , mg ybco samples were investigated by measuring @xmath0-curves . on these curves",
    "fe was observed is in a wide temperature range .",
    "the origin of the fe existence is a significant influence of both surface barrier and bulk pinning .",
    "bulk pinning influences parameters @xmath9 and @xmath39 while surface barrier influences @xmath40 .",
    "undoped ybco is characterized by a significant aging effect which is manifested in a considerable change of @xmath9 and @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to the change of bulk pinning . for ag - doped ybco",
    "there are no significant changes in @xmath9 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "such difference is caused by the redistribution of pinning centers in undoped ybco while ag - doped ybco is characterized by huge mechanical tensions which prevent redistribution .",
    "possible origin of redistribution for s1 is a decrease in number of dislocations , i.e. sample becomes more homogenous .",
