    "laser driven photochemistry has proven to be a useful tool for promoting reactions at surfaces or even as a way to open new reaction channels not accessible by thermal activation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one important reaction is the photodesorption of a molecule from a metal surface .",
    "generally , desorption on metals can be induced either by directly exciting the molecule ( ir photons ) or it can be substrate mediated ( uv / vis / near ir photons ) . among substrate mediated processes , one usually distinguishes between desorption induced by electronic transitions ( diet ) and desorption induced by multiple electronic transitions ( dimet )  @xcite .",
    "diet is practically realized by using continuous wave or nanosecond - pulse lasers with low intensity , resulting in small desorption yields that increase linearly with laser fluence . in diet on metals ,",
    "the adsorbate captures a hot electron and forms a short lived excited state ( negative ion resonance ) . after decaying to the electronic ground state",
    ", the adsorbate may gain enough energy and desorb . on the contrary , dimet , which is the subject of the present study ,",
    "is realized by intense femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "such pulses are short in comparison to typical relaxation times of adsorbate excited states and , consequently , they can produce multiple excitations of an adsorbate that lead to desorption .",
    "dimet results in relatively large desorption yields that increase superlinearly with laser fluence  @xcite .",
    "different methods have been used to model dimet  @xcite .",
    "several of them are the so - called excitation - deexcitation models , in which the system jumps between two or more electronic states ( see review  @xcite for a complete list ) .",
    "however , these methods due to their complexity have only been applied to a reduced number of degrees of freedom . in this work",
    ", we use an alternative model  @xcite that permits treating all the molecular degrees of freedom . instead of treating excited states explicitly , in this model the nuclear motion",
    "is classical in the ground state potential and all the electronic degrees of freedom are included via friction and associated fluctuation forces .",
    "the friction force accounts for the dissipation of the adsorbate energy on the surface by creation of low energy electron - hole pairs , while fluctuation forces represent the inelastic scattering of hot electrons on the adsorbate nuclei .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuation force is obtained in terms of the temperature of the laser - induced hot electrons .",
    "this electronic temperature can be estimated from the properties of the laser pulse and the metal substrate .",
    "the first important ingredient of this model is an accurate ground state potential , which can be modelled with a range of methods with increasing accuracy and theoretical , as well as , computational complexity , starting with simple two body potentials up to accurate quantum chemistry methods .",
    "early works that used the molecular dynamics with electronic friction model to simulate the laser - induced desorption were based on empirical potentials  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , one can obtain better accuracy and predictability by state of the art non - empirical theoretical methods .",
    "particularly , a good balance between accuracy and computational complexity is achieved by density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this method , already at its semi - local level , is able to capture reasonably well both metallic delocalized states and molecular localized states and their interaction .",
    "ab initio molecular dynamics , in which dft is used at each integration step to calculate the forces , keeps both the dft accuracy and the full dimensionality of the problem . however , it is still computationally too demanding to treat low probability processes or even to run long time ( more than few ps ) dynamics . in this work",
    "we are interested in phenomena that typically demand both large statistics and long time dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is more advantageous to follow an alternative scheme that consists in constructing the adiabatic potential energy surface ( pes ) from a large set of dft energies .",
    "several interpolation techniques have been developed to obtain pess that preserve the dft accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the main prerequisite is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to the molecular degrees of freedom , to decrease the computational demand , thus keeping the surface frozen .",
    "this means that in the case of diatomic molecules , the interaction of the molecule and the surface is described by a six dimensional ( 6d ) pes .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to study the dynamics of different molecules on different metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "recently , the laser - induced associative desorption of h@xmath0 on ru(0001 ) has been successfully modelled by using such dft - based 6d pes  @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the metal surface is kept frozen and the laser excitation is only modelled by random scattering of hot electrons with the nuclei of the molecule . here , we extend this model by allowing for lattice movement that enables us to incorporate laser - induced phonon excitations .",
    "the study of the effect of phonons in photodesorption , compared to that of electronic excitations , is one of the main objectives of this work .    as an example , we will employ this methodology to study the laser - induced desorption of o@xmath0 on ag(110 ) .",
    "due to the importance of oxygen adsorption on silver surfaces in the process of ethylene epoxidation , this system has been a subject of numerous studies  @xcite .",
    "using the _ corrugation reducing procedure _ ( crp )  @xcite , we have recently constructed the first dft - based 6d pes for o@xmath0 on ag(110 ) and used it to study the dissociative adsorption process  @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath0 molecule can adsorb on ag(110 ) on several adsorption sites that are characterized by different adsorption energies and electronic densities and , as such , it is an interesting model system .",
    "it gives us the possibility to investigate the importance of including the phonon excitations in the model for desorption from adsorption wells of different characteristics .",
    "photochemistry of o@xmath0 on ag(110 ) after substrate mediated photoexcitation under diet conditions has been studied experimentally in refs .",
    "photodesorption , photodissociation , and also co@xmath0 formation were observed there . to our knowledge ,",
    "no experimental studies under dimet ( femtosecond laser ) conditions have been carried out so far . as such",

    "focusing on the ldfa calculations , it is clear that the desorption yields ( table  [ tabley ] ) and rates for the bridge wells ( fig .",
    "[ rate2 ] ) are reduced to marginal levels as compared to the ones obtained for the hollow sites",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ rate3 ] and the glo values in table  [ tabley ] show that the phonon - mediated contribution to desorption is rather similar among the four wells .",
    "in fact , the small differences we observe seem to be correlated with the differences in adsorption energy .",
    "thus , the lowest yield corresponds to the sb site , the one with the largest @xmath61 , and the largest yield to the h110 , the one with the lowest @xmath61 .",
    "the intermediate cases represented by the lb and h001 sites , which have the same @xmath61 , show very similar desorption yields .",
    "the absence of a similar one to one correspondence between @xmath61 and the ldfa yields points to the electronic - mediated mechanism as the one responsible for removing that correlation in the ldfa+glo yields , since in both cases the largest to lowest values for desorption follow the order h110 , h001 , lb , and sb .",
    "yet , it remains to be understood what property ( together with @xmath61 ) rules the efficiency of the electronic mechanism .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ ldfa ] , the electronic contribution to desorption is determined within the ldfa description by the value of the bare surface electron density at the position of each adsorbate ( in our case the o atoms ) .",
    "the density profile along the plane normal to the surface that contains the molecule is shown in fig .",
    "[ den ] for each of the adsorption configurations , together with the corresponding o atom positions .",
    "the inset shows the friction coefficient of one o atom as a function of the electronic density . clearly , the embedding electron density is higher when the molecule is adsorbed on the hollow than on the bridge wells ( see also table  [ tableads ] )",
    "this nicely fits with the results we have obtained .",
    "when @xmath1 is high , the fluctuation forces acting on o@xmath0 are correspondingly larger if adsorbed on the hollow wells than if adsorbed on the bridge wells . therefore , despite the similar adsorption energies of h001 and lb , desorption is more efficient from the former because of the larger embedding density .    , for the configurations of the four adsorption sites .",
    "contour lines are separated by @xmath67  a.u .",
    ", in the range from @xmath68  a.u .",
    "to @xmath69  a.u . as shown by the color map .",
    "the positions of the oxygen atoms in the adsorption sites are shown with red dots .",
    "the inset shows the friction coefficient as a function of electronic density given in terms of @xmath64 .",
    "[ den ] ]    further insight regarding the competition between the electron- and phonon - mediated mechanisms can be gained by comparing the ldfa and glo results to those obtained with the ldfa+glo simulations .",
    "thus , the ldfa model predicts larger yields for the electron - dominated desorption cases ( h110 , h001 ) than the ldfa+glo .",
    "the reason is that the adsorbed o@xmath0 , being efficiently heated during the initial time interval in which @xmath1 is high , reaches temperatures larger than @xmath2 at least during this period .",
    "therefore , when surface motion is also included in the dynamics , the surface takes energy from the electronically heated molecule and the desorption probability is reduced in respect to the ideal case in which no surface motion is allowed . in the case of the glo simulations ,",
    "the yields are slightly larger than the ldfa+glo ones for the lb site , suggesting energy uptake by the electronic system , while for the sb well the ldfa+glo yields almost coincide with the sum of the glo and ldfa values .",

    "red squares show the results of the dynamics .",
    "the blue line is obtained by fitting the data to the following function : @xmath70 .",
    "[ ang ] ]    in the following , we analyze the characteristics of the molecules desorbed from the different wells .",
    "the corresponding angular distributions of the desorbed molecules are shown in fig .",
    "these distributions are rather symmetrical around a desorbing angle of @xmath71 relative to the surface normal for all the adsorption wells . nevertheless , in the case of molecules desorbed from the h110 site a slight tendency to desorb into directions closer to the surface normal is observed .",
    "we fit the obtained angular distribution to the velocity integrated flux - weighted maxwell - boltzmann distribution  @xcite that gives @xmath70 .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is a measure of the alignment of the desorption flux . for large values of @xmath72",
    "the flux is aligned normal to the surface and the distribution is narrow , while @xmath73 corresponds to a cosine distribution . as seen in fig .",
    "[ ang ] , @xmath72 is practically one for desorption from the h100 , lb , and sb wells and it is somewhat larger than one for the h110 well .",
    "these ( small ) values contrast with the values @xmath74 obtained for the associative desorption of h@xmath0 from ru(0001 )  @xcite . in that case , the deviation from the cosine distribution was explained by the presence of a late barrier towards desorption , causing a channeling effect and narrow angular distribution . however , in our case , the potential energy defining the molecule - surface interaction is monotonically increasing from the wells to the vacuum region ( see fig .",
    "5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which results in @xmath75 .    .",
    "values for low fluences and sb well are not shown due to the poor statistics .",
    "[ eqvi ] ]    next , we analyze how the energy of the desorbing molecules are partitioned in translational and internal ( vibrational and rotational ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the dependence of the translational , vibrational , and rotational energies of the molecules desorbed from the four adsorption wells as a function of the laser fluence is shown in fig .",
    "equipartition of energy between the different degrees of freedom of a free diatomic molecule means that the values of its translational , vibrational , and rotational energies are ordered according to the ratio @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ eqvi ] shows that only in the case of lb , where desorption is dominantly phonon - mediated , the ideal thermal desorption is approximately fulfilled .",
    "deviations from the ideal ratio are already observed for desorption from the sb well , which is also a phonon - dominated process , and more clearly for h001 and h110 ( both electron dominated ) . in these three cases , and for all the laser fluences ,",
    "the translational energy is the largest and the rotational energy is the lowest . within a good approximation , a linear increase with the laser fluence of the vibrational and translational energies of the desorbed molecules is observed .",
    "this is considered to be one of the hallmarks of dimet  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that we also observe few dissociation events for molecules initially adsorbed in the h110 well .",
    "this is a very unlikely process that has only been observed at the highest fluences ( @xmath77 175 j / m@xmath65 ) and with probabilities lower than @xmath78 . in these conditions",
    "it is not possible to perform a more detailed analysis of the process .",
    "still , the occurrence of dissociation events is an interesting result considering that the energy barrier to dissociation is @xmath79 ev  @xcite , significantly larger than the well depth of @xmath80  ev .",
    "in summary , we have extended the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to simulate the multidimensional dynamics of a molecule adsorbed on a metal surface excited by an ultrashort laser pulse by including surface movement ( phonons ) via the glo model .",
    "this allows us to treat simultaneously the laser induced electron and phonon excitations and their effect on the dynamics of the eventually desorbing molecule .    using this new approach",
    "we have studied the laser induced desorption of o@xmath0 from ag(110 ) .",
    "an interesting feature of this system is that it possesses four distinct molecular adsorption wells .",
    "this enables us to study how the desorption mechanisms are connected to the properties of the adsorption configuration . in general",
    ", we find that the effect of the laser - heated phonons in this system can not be disregarded .",
    "importantly , the phonon contribution to the desorption yield can be either positive or negative depending on the adsorption site .",
    "more precisely , when the molecule is initially adsorbed on the bridge sites inclusion of phonons increases the desorption probability .",
    "in fact , for these sites , coupling of the molecule to the phonon excitations constitutes the main desorption mechanism . however , for molecules adsorbed on the hollow sites not only the electronic channel is the dominant mechanism , but inclusion of phonons reduces the desorption probabilities because they take energy from the excited molecule .",
    "the subsequent reductions of the desorption yields can be rather high , in the range of a factor @xmath81 , depending on the laser fluence .",
    "these observations are rationalized in terms of the distances from the surface at which the adsorption sites are located and the subsequent values of the electronic density in their surroundings .",
    "hollow sites are closer to the surface than bridge sites and , consequently , in regions of higher electronic density .",
    "for this reason the electron channel dominates desorption in the former and the phonon channel in the latter .",
    "our results also suggest which desorption mechanism will be dominant in systems that present both physisorbed and chemisorbed species . since physisorbed molecules are located in low electronic density regions their desorption behavior is expected to be similar to the one we obtain for the bridge sites , whereas for chemisorbed states our findings for hollow sites apply .",

    "<S> we simulate the femtosecond laser induced desorption dynamics of a diatomic molecule from a metal surface by including the effect of the electron and phonon excitations created by the laser pulse . following previous models , </S>",
    "<S> the laser induced surface excitation is treated through the two temperature model , while the multidimensional dynamics of the molecule is described by a classical langevin equation , in which the friction and random forces account for the action of the heated electrons . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose the additional use of the generalized langevin oscillator model to also include the effect of the energy exchange between the molecule and the heated surface lattice in the desorption dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to study the laser induced desorption of o@xmath0 from the ag(110 ) surface , making use of a six - dimensional potential energy surface calculated within density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal the importance of the phonon mediated process and show that , depending on the value of the electronic density in the surroundings of the molecule adsorption site , its inclusion can significantly enhance or reduce the desorption probabilities .    published in  phys .  </S>",
