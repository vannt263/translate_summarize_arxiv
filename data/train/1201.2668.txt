    "table  2 contains a similar list of the 65 observations subsequent to the 2009  january outburst .    for all observations ,",

    "then , for each observation , we extracted a time series binned at a resolution of 1/32  s , in the 2@xmath06.5  kev range ( to maximize the signal to noise ratio ) , which utilized all pcus , to be used in the timing and pulse profile analysis . also for each observation , we extracted time series in various energy ranges , binned at the same time resolution , but excluding pcus 0 and 1 because of the loss of their propane layers , to be used for the pulsed flux , pulse profile , and hardness ratio analyses .",

    "we used all 16 observations taken between 2008 october  03 and 2009 january  12 , 14 of which were taken in the month following the onset of the 2008 outburst , and the remaining 2 taken in 2009 january , see figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "we also used 8 _ swift _ observations taken in the 23 days following the onset of the 2009 outburst , and all observations taken between 2009 february  13 and 2009 december  26 that were long enough to yield a clear pulse profile .",
    "table  3 contains a list of the _ swift _ observations used in this work , all of which were in windowed timing ( wt ) mode . for each observation , we extracted photons from a 40-pixel - long strip centered on the source , and we adjusted the photon arrival times of each epoch to the solar system barycenter .",
    "then , for each observation , we extracted a time series binned at a resolution of 1/32 s in the 2@xmath07  kev range , to match the _ rxte _ band .",
    "time series for all 95 _ rxte _ observations having a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio were divided in half and treated as two separate time series .",
    "time series for all 32 _ swift _ observations were not divided .",
    "each time series was epoch - folded using an ephemeris determined iteratively by maintaining phase coherence as we describe below . when an ephemeris was not available , we folded the time series using a frequency obtained from a periodogram . resulting pulse profiles , with 64 phase bins , were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise - ratio template created by adding phase - aligned profiles .",
    "the cross - correlation returned an average pulse time - of - arrival ( toa ) for each observation , corresponding to a fixed pulse phase .    the pulse phase @xmath23 at any time @xmath24 can usually be expressed as a taylor expansion ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26  @xmath27  1/@xmath9 is the pulse frequency ,",
    "@xmath1  @xmath27  @xmath28/@xmath29 , etc@xmath30 , and subscript `` 0 '' denotes a parameter evaluated at the reference epoch @xmath31 .    to obtain ephemerides for the time periods following each outburst , we fitted the toas to the above polynomial using the pulsar timing software package tempo . since the spin - down of this source was unstable , and since consecutive observations were not always sufficiently close to each other , phase coherence could only be unambiguously maintained for a period of 29 days following the first outburst , and 23 days following the second outburst",
    "the two timing solutions found are represented by solid red lines in the first two panels of figure  [ f2 ] , along with the radio timing parameters of the same source from 2007 @xcite .",
    "the spin parameters for these two timing solutions are shown in table  4 .",
    "the 2008 and 2009 ephemerides are consistent within 2@xmath32 with those reported in @xcite and in @xcite , although they extend for a few days longer than in the previous analyses .",
    "we made various attempts at finding the pulsar frequency outside of these time periods .",
    "first , for each instance where closely spaced _ rxte _",
    "observations were available , a frequency measurement was found by doing tempo fits through the closely spaced toas .",
    "these frequency measurements are shown as dark blue points in the first panel of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "then , all 29 observations longer than 5.5  ks were broken into 2 or 3 fragments , toas were extracted for each fragment , and a frequency measurement was found for each long observation by fitting a linear trend to the phases with tempo .",
    "these frequency measurements are shown as light blue points in the first panel of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "we also made several attempts at finding phase - coherent timing solutions outside the one month following each outburst .",
    "we broke the list of all toas ( one or two toas per observation ) into 69 overlapping sets of toas .",
    "for each set of toas , we searched for a phase - coherent timing solution by running a tempo fit for every plausible combination of @xmath26 and @xmath1 .",
    "the results of the search of one such set of toas are presented in figure  [ f3 ] . for each guess combination of @xmath26 and @xmath1 ,",
    "tempo returned a best - fit @xmath26 and @xmath1 , and timing residuals from which a reduced @xmath33 was extracted and represented as a shade in figure  [ f3 ] , with the darker shade corresponding to a smaller reduced @xmath34 .",
    "note the appearance of several `` islands '' on the figure .",
    "the center of each island corresponds to the best - fit @xmath26 and @xmath1 returned by tempo .    the fact that many islands appear in the figure indicates that any timing solution found to cover the time period spanned by the set of toas is not unique .",
    "instead , the various islands correspond to several plausible timing solutions , differing from each other by a small number of pulse phases .    once a shaded @xmath26 and @xmath1 map , like that shown in figure  [ f3 ] , was obtained for each overlapping set of toas , we collapsed each map , in the horizontal direction , into a single shaded column .",
    "the shade at each height of the column corresponds to the darkest shade in the corresponding row of the original @xmath26 and @xmath1 map before the collapse .",
    "we then plotted all the shaded columns in figure  [ f4 ] , along with the various phase - connected timing solutions and along with the individual frequency measurements .    for the columns near the outbursts , the number of dark spots in each shaded column was small , indicating a small number of possible phase - connected timing solutions",
    "however , the fact that the number of dark regions in each shaded column increased as we got further from the outbursts clearly indicates that timing solutions found outside of the time periods covering the month following each outburst are not unique .",
    "some of the longest - running non - unique solutions are shown as dotted red lines in figures  [ f2 ] and  [ f4 ] . in the 2008 event ,",
    "the loss of phase - coherence is almost certainly due to enhanced timing noise in the pulsar as the frequency of observations had not significantly dropped when phase coherence was lost ; in the 2009 event , the time interval between observations was somewhat larger when phase coherence was lost , although the coincidence of the loss and the decay of the persistent flux suggests the source behavior plays an important role .",
    "first , for each _ rxte _ observation , we folded the data in the 26.5  kev band using the best - fit frequency found in the timing analysis ( section  3 ) .",
    "we then cross - correlated the resulting profile with a standard template in order to obtain phase - aligned profiles .",
    "we then divided the period following the first outburst ( 3  october to 22  january ) into intervals with similar net exposures , shown with the letters a through k at the bottom of figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "we did the same for the period following the second outburst ( 22  january to 26  december  26 ) ; the intervals are shown with the letters l through p at the bottom of figure  [ f5 ] .    for each time interval , we summed the aligned profiles , subtracted the dc component , and scaled the resulting profile so that the value of the highest bin is unity and the lowest point is zero . the results are presented in figure  [ f5 ] with the time intervals marked in the top left corner of each profile .",
    "the different profile qualities are due to the changes in the pulsed flux of the pulsar",
    ". nevertheless , clear changes in pulse morphology are apparent .",
    "for example , the profile peak is clearly narrower immediately following the second 2008 pulsed flux enhancement , and shows the full width , but is more flat - topped following the 2009 outburst .",
    "the results shown here are generally consistent with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note however that in no case are any pulse profile changes so large that the profile peak , the assumed fiducial point , can not be unambiguously identified .",
    "this is in contrast to other examples of axp outbursts in which multiple peaks appeared , rendering unambiguous pulse numbering problematic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this gives us confidence that the timing analysis reported in the previous section , in particular the difficulties phase - connecting the timing data , are not significantly affected by pulse profile changes .",
    "indeed the epochs in which the profile changes are largest ( namely immediately following the outbursts ) are those which we have successfully phase - connected .    to study the evolution of the pulse profile with energy , we repeated the above analysis for energy bands 2@xmath04  kev , 4@xmath010  kev , and 2@xmath010  kev .",
    "figure  [ f6 ] shows the evolution of the pulsed flux with energy for time intervals m and  n indicated at the bottom of figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "note that the location of the peak of the profile seems to be energy - dependent , with the peak more to the left at higher energies , and more to the right at lower energies .",
    "this implies that spectral changes might cause slight shifts in the location of the pulse peak in the energy band used for the timing analysis ( 2@xmath06.5  kev ) , but again , not large enough to cause a loss in pulse counting .",
    "also note that pulse profiles at higher energies are not shown because of the very poor signal - to - noise ratio at these energies .",
    "to obtain the pulsed flux for 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 , for each observation , we folded the data and extracted aligned pulse profiles in several energy bands . for each folded profile , we calculated the rms pulsed flux ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 even fourier component defined as @xmath36 = @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the variance of @xmath36 , @xmath40 is the odd @xmath37 fourier component defined as @xmath40 = @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the variance of @xmath40 , @xmath43 refers to the phase bin , @xmath44 is the total number of phase bins , @xmath45 is the count rate in the @xmath46 phase bin of the pulse profile , and @xmath47 is the maximum number of fourier harmonics used ; here @xmath47=4 .    in the top panel of figure  [ f7 ] ,",
    "we show the rms pulsed flux in 2@xmath010  kev , 2@xmath04  kev , and in 4@xmath010  kev .",
    "note the 2@xmath010  kev time series was previously shown by ng et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and scholz & kaspi ( 2011 ) .",
    "the panel shows a slow decrease in the pulsed flux after the first outburst interrupted by a spike 9 days after the outburst .",
    "the spike was followed by a slow decrease .",
    "the source behaves differently after the second outburst , when the persistent flux increases dramatically ( figure  [ f2]d ) while the pulsed flux does not vary significantly , implying a large decrease in the pulsed fraction following the second outburst .",
    "this is consistent with results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ f7 ]",
    ", we show the hardness ratio as a function of time , computed from ratio of the pulsed fluxes in the energy ranges 4@xmath020  kev to 2@xmath04  kev .",
    "the figure shows a clear discontinuity in the pulsed hardness ratio @xmath3  15 days after the outburst , in the time period bracketed by the last two dotted lines , which , notably , is subsequent to the bulk of the pulsed flux decay , but while the persistent flux was still relatively high .",
    "we also computed the hardness ratio in various other energy bands , but the discontinuity was most significant for the energy range shown .",
    "unfortunately _ suzaku _ @xcite and _ integral _ @xcite hard x - ray observations of the source both occurred prior to the hardness change seen with _",
    "the behavior of 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 over the past several years has been extremely complex , indeed mirroring the complexity of the behaviors of axps in outburst in general . in a collection of detailed analyses of various x - ray and gamma - ray data sets @xcite , including the present _ rxte _ study reported on herein , a picture emerges of dramatic and varied multiwavelength behavior , including at least two very different outbursts from this intriguing source , albeit bearing some common properties . in the latter category",
    "is the generic x - ray hardness / flux correlation seen now commonly in magnetar outbursts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) , x - ray pulse profile changes , and ubiquitous x - ray bursting near outburst epochs , and significant changes in spin - down rate at and surrounding outburst epochs .",
    "we focus on this latter point here .",
    "magnetar rotational evolution during and near radiative outbursts has shown a wide range of behaviours , including large spin - up glitches with unusual recoveries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , likely spin - down events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , initial spin - up events paired with large over - recovery , yielding net spin - down @xcite , and large @xmath1 variations on week - to - month time scales @xcite .",
    "we note that throughout , no axp has ever been observed to spin _ up _ for an extended period of any duration ; only changes in magnitude in the spin-_down _ rate punctuated by occasional , sudden , unresolved spin - up events have yet been observed .",
    "this is in stark contrast to behavior generally seen in accreting systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the diversity in magnetar rotational evolutions near the epochs of radiative outbursts has been perplexing .",
    "however , we note that the behavior of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 following its 2008 outburst is reminiscent of unusual timing evolution seen thus far uniquely in axp 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 following its 2002 flux ` flare ' @xcite .",
    "we compare the two next .    in the case of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , the pulsar s pulsed flux had been relatively stable in several years of _ rxte _ monitoring , when a small ( factor of @xmath32 ) pulsed flux increase was observed near the end of 2001 ( see fig .",
    "8e ) , accompanied by short sgr - like bursts @xcite and pulse profile changes @xcite .",
    "the pulsed flux relaxed back to near quiescence in @xmath33 weeks , but then there was a second , larger pulsed flux increase , this time by a factor of @xmath33 over the span of a few weeks .",
    "this larger pulsed flux ` flare ' subsequently decayed on a time scale of several months .",
    "this latter decay occurred just prior to an increase in the magnitude of @xmath1 , by over an order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "8c ) . during both flares ,",
    "the pulsar suffered significant pulse profile changes , the largest of which were at the flare peak , with the pulse relaxing back on approximately the same time scale as the pulsed flux dropped .",
    "subsequently , there was a @xmath32-yr period of large variations in @xmath1 , which while always remaining negative , varied by as much as an order of magnitude on time scales of a few weeks ( see fig .",
    "15 in @xcite ; fig .",
    "phase connection in this extremely noisy interval was difficult , but enabled by extremely frequent _ rxte _ observations  approximately three per 710-day interval .",
    "the 2008 outburst of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 showed similar behavior ( fig .",
    "the pulsed flux was clearly enhanced in our _ rxte _ observations , which were triggered by sgr - like bursts .",
    "this enhancement then started to relax , but the decay was interrupted by a second pulsed flux increase @xmath32 weeks later , this time by a factor of @xmath34 , similar to the increase in the pulsed flux in the second 2002 flare of 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 ( compare fig . 8e and f ) .",
    "the pulse profile changed , particularly near the peak of the second ` flare . ' moreover , @xmath1 , as for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , dropped by a factor of @xmath34 , but roughly in concert with the pulsed flux decrease , before phase - coherence was lost ( fig .",
    "it is plausible that large @xmath1 variations ensued , but we can not unambiguously confirm this as the spacing of subsequent _ rxte _ and _ swift _ observations was not as dense as for 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "clearly though , @xmath1 recovered to its 2007 value by the time of the 2009 outburst , so another dramatic change must have occurred .",
    "thus , the behavior of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 during its 2008 outburst is similar to that of 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 in 2001 - 2002 , as suggested in figure 8 : in both cases there was an initial , smaller flare accompanied by bursting , and a much larger flare a few weeks later . in both cases , the flares were accompanied by pulse profile changes in which the largest changes occurred near the peaks of the flares5937 also showed a double - peaked pulsed flux variation accompanied by significant pulse profile changes ; see fig . 15 in @xcite . ] .",
    "then , importantly , a pulsed flux decay occurred near or simultaneous with an increase in the magnitude of @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath34 , followed by a very noisy period , in which regular phase - coherent timing was impossible .",
    "we note these similarities exist in spite of the fact that 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 is a persistent , bright axp , while 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 has the properties of a transient axp .",
    "note however that this behavior was not replicated in the 2009 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 outburst : in that case @xmath1 remained close to that reported in the radio data by @xcite .",
    "also , in the 2009 outburst , the pulsed flux was barely affected , while the persistent flux increased by an order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "2 ) . still , phase - coherence became again impossible some 23 days after the 2009 outburst .",
    "we note low - level but significant pulsed flux variations subsequently , which could be relevant .",
    "the similarity between the 2008 outburst of 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 and the 2001 - 2002 outburst of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 is potentially interesting . in the magnetar model ,",
    "large flux enhancements are easy to envision given the great stresses placed on the crust due to internal magnetic field decay .",
    "moreover , field - line distortions in the magnetosphere are expected as the crust shifts and the magnetosphere twists , hence pulse profile changes are also generically expected .",
    "@xcite argues that magnetospheric twists will impact the pulsar spin - down in two possible ways .",
    "one is that a strong twist results in an enhancement of the poloidal field lines , which leads to a stronger spin - down torque on the star @xcite .",
    "this enhanced @xmath1 is then expected to decay back to the standard value .",
    "the second way is that once the twist angle @xmath48 reaches a maximum value , it `` boils over , '' with energy that would have been stored in the magnetosphere had @xmath48 continued to increase being carried away by an intermittent magnetic outflow , which can carry away significant angular momentum . in this picture",
    ", any delay between such intermittent magnetic outflows and the outburst onset is due to the time it takes @xmath48 to reach its maximal value , though the increase in @xmath1 is expected to commence much earlier @xcite .",
    "while the torque variations picture put forth by @xcite may provide a qualitative explanation of the behavior we have seen in the 2001 - 2002 outburst of 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 and the 2008 outburst of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 , it remains to be seen if the model can explain quantitatively the large @xmath1 variations observed unambiguously for 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 , namely order - of - magnitude magnitude changes .",
    "indeed the magnitude of the initial torque increase for strong ( @xmath49 ) twists was not estimated by beloborodov ( 2009 ) , as it requires a full nonlinear calculation .",
    "an initial estimate for moderate twists suggests the fractional change in effective dipole field due to poloidal inflation varies as @xmath50 , which could be checked if many similar outbursts are observed .    however , in the case of 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 , it is difficult to understand why the magnitude of @xmath1 remained small and unchanged in the 23 days following the 2009 event trigger , while the persistent x - ray luminosity decayed from an order - of - magnitude increase .",
    "that there was very little change in the pulsed flux seems relevant , suggesting any poloidal field enhancement has to be accompanied by a pulsed flux increase .",
    "this seems reasonable if the pulsed emission emerges from the polar region , a hypothesis that may be testable via x - ray polarimetry .",
    "perhaps then the 2009 event involved a much greater fraction of the neutron star , and , at least initially , impacted the poloidal region minimally .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , disk models appear to have difficulty explaining the changes in pulsed flux and torques we have observed .",
    "this is because , at least for the propeller torque prescription of @xcite , the x - ray luminosity is expected to vary as @xmath51 , which is not consistent with the data .",
    "moreover , the disparate behaviors in 2008 and 2009 also pose a major challenge to any disk model , though are also not obviously explained in the @xcite picture .",
    "the long - term timing behavior of the source is summarized in figures 2(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "clearly the enhancement in the magnitude of @xmath1 is an interesting event in the pulsar s long - term spin - down history .",
    "the early 2007 - 2008 radio data ( shown in green in fig .",
    "2a ) show that a quadratic polynomial was required to describe the spin - down @xcite , with @xmath2 @xmath360 times smaller than that seen in 2008 .",
    "if the radio ephemeris is extrapolated to the start of the 2008 outburst , it over - predicts the frequency by approximately @xmath330",
    "@xmath18s , consistent with there having been other episodes of enhanced spin - down .",
    "if these were small in number , we might have expected accompanying radiative events as in 2008 , but none are reported .",
    "this supports the 2008 enhanced spin - down being particularly notable .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that every observed axp flare or outburst thus far were accompanied by a timing event , possibly caused by some unpinning of fluid vortices , which in turn was caused by crustal movement due to a twist propagating outward . @xcite",
    "also noted that the converse is not true : many axp glitches appear to be relatively silent .",
    "this leads to the question of whether the onsets of the 2008 and 2009 outbursts of 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 were accompanied by glitches . for the 2008 outburst",
    ", this question is impossible to answer given the lack of observations prior to the outburst .",
    "the question is also difficult to answer for the 2009 outburst given the sparsity of data and loss of phase coherence prior to the outburst . to provide an answer",
    ", we found a phase - coherent solution covering only the three observations just prior to the onset of the 2009 outburst ( 2 _ rxte _ observations and one _ swift _ observation , ephemeris covering mjd 54839@xmath054845 , see the small red lines just prior to the 2009 oubutst in panels  1 and  2 of figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "this returned the following parameters for reference epoch 54845.0 : @xmath52=0.4826070(3 )  s@xmath22 , @xmath1=@xmath05.6(1.3)@xmath710@xmath53  s@xmath54 .",
    "when this solution is extrapolated forward in time to the date of the first post - onset observation , the frequency obtained is 9.6(5)@xmath710@xmath55  s@xmath22 _ larger _ than the known frequency at that epoch .",
    "this change in frequency is in a direction opposite to that which a spin - up glitch would cause .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility of a glitch , because a glitch followed by an over - recovery has been reported previously @xcite .",
    "the hardness ratio increase shown in figure 7 is interesting . @xcite and @xcite both reported on hard x - ray observations made within 10 days after the 2009 outburst trigger .",
    "they showed that in addition to a soft blackbody , a single power law of index @xmath56 could describe the data up to 200 kev .",
    "the hardness ratio as measured by _",
    "rxte _ increased significantly on mjd 54853 , @xmath35 days after the _ integral _ observation , at an epoch when the 110  kev emission showed no remarkable change @xcite .",
    "this suggests that after mjd 54853 , either a single power law no longer adequately described the data , or the power - law index hardened",
    ". this may indicate decoupling between the soft and hard emission processes ; hard x - ray monitoring after a future outburst could check this .",
    "decoupling between the soft and hard x - ray emission mechanisms would be interesting , as it would argue against a causal relationship in an observed spectral correlation between these emission components @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have reported on detailed _ rxte _ and _ swift _ monitoring of the axp 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 from 2008 october through 2009 december .",
    "we have presented pulsed flux time series in multiple energy bands , as well as as a detailed analysis of the source s timing behavior , with phase - coherence being maintained only for two @xmath33  wk intervals following the 2008 and 2009 outbursts .",
    "we showed that outside this time period several plausible timing solutions fit the pulsar s frequency behavior in spite of relatively dense monitoring .",
    "we find a remarkable decrease in the magnitude of @xmath1 in concert with the falling of the pulsed flux following the 2008 outburst , and note a similarity in the events of the 2001 - 2002 outburst of 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "however this interesting behavior is not fully replicated following the 2009 outburst of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 .",
    "we note a significant hardening of the source @xmath315 days after the 2009 outburst below 20  kev , at an epoch when the 110  kev x - ray flux shows no obvious change .",
    "the diversity of timing behaviors of axps and magnetars in general near the epochs of radiative outbursts continues to be challenging to understand , although the magnetar framework first outlined by @xcite and subsequently refined by @xcite seems promising .",
    "we thank the _ rxte _ and _ swift _ staff for their efficiency in scheduling the above - described observations .",

    "<S> we present the results of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) and _ swift _ monitoring observations of the magnetar 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 following the pulsar s radiative outbursts in 2008  october and 2009  january . </S>",
    "<S> we report on a study of the evolution of the timing properties and the pulsed flux from 2008 october  4 through 2009 december  26 . in our timing study </S>",
    "<S> , a phase - coherent analysis shows that for the first 29 days following the 2008 outburst , there was a very fast increase in the magnitude of the rotational frequency derivative @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 was a factor of @xmath3  60 larger than that reported in data from 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath1 magnitude increase occurred in concert with the decay of the pulsed flux following the start of the 2008 event . following the 2009 outburst , for the first 23 days , @xmath2 was consistent with zero , and @xmath1 had returned to close to its 2007 value . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the 2008 event , the 2009 outburst showed a major increase in persistent flux , relatively little change in the pulsed flux , and sudden significant spectral hardening @xmath315  days after the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , excluding the month following each of the outbursts , and because of the noise and the sparsity in the data , multiple plausible timing solutions fit the pulsar s frequency behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we note similarities in the behavior of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 following the 2008 outburst to that seen in the axp 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 following its 2001 - 2002 outburst and discuss this in terms of the magnetar model . </S>"
