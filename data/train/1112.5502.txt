    "as single nuclei have exceedingly small magnetic moments , a large ensemble ( typically @xmath0 nuclear spins ) is necessary to obtain an observable signal employing methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( nmr ) . as a consequence , chemical and biological processes",

    "single - molecule studies can instead allow one to learn structural information and time trajectories of individual molecules free of natural disorder @xcite .",
    "the detection of a single nucleus in a single molecule can thus provide various new possibilities for single molecule spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , single nuclear spins have long coherence time due to their weak coupling with the environment which makes them promising candidates for a qubit or a quantum register .",

    "efficient readout of the nitrogen nuclear spin state of a single molecule is crucial .",
    "nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond have been used to construct ultrasensitive nano - scale magnetometers @xcite , and have led to interesting applications in nano imaging @xcite and biology as well @xcite .",
    "nv centers in diamond benefit from long coherence times at room temperature and highly developed techniques for coherent control , noise decoupling schemes and optical readout of their electron spins .",
    "a single nv center can be used to detect single external electron spin @xcite and a proximal nuclear spin ( within a few atom shells ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that it is possible to detect a strongly coupled nuclear spin pair @xcite and measure noise spectra @xcite by applying dynamical decoupling pulses .",
    "the schemes based on decoupling pulses may nevertheless suffer various constraints such as the limited achievable repetition rate of pulses and the power requirement .",
    "as a consequence the detection of individual nuclear spins in the presence of realistic environments still remains a challenging task .",
    "the key obstacles originate firstly from the requirement that coherence times are sufficiently long in order to observe the effect of single nuclei on the nv spin .",
    "the second key obstacle lies in the difficulty of distinguishing a distant nuclear spin from other environmental nuclei that couple to the nv spin .    in this work ,",
    "we address both challenges by continuously driving a single nv electron spin and use it as a probe to measure a specific transition frequency of the target system .",
    "the role of continuous driving is two - fold : firstly , it decouples the nv spin from the unwanted influence of a spin bath ( which is particularly strong for nv centers located close to the surface @xcite ) to achieve sufficiently long coherence times @xcite ; secondly , by changing the rabi frequency of the external driving field we can tune the nv spin to match the target frequency and thus selectively enhance the sensitivity for this specific frequency which allows us to single out the target nucleus . with this scheme",

    "we demonstrate how to use this mechanism to implement quantum non - demolition(qnd ) measurement of a single nitrogen nuclear spin state in a cage molecule of fullerene ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is achieved by exploiting the fact that the flip - flop process between the nv spin and the target system will either be allowed or prohibited dependent on the nuclear spin state for a specific nv spin initial state .",

    "when the rabi frequency @xmath3 is on resonance with one specific transition frequency of the target system , the flip - flop process will happen between the dressed nv spin and the target system , which leads to a change of the nv dressed state population that can be measured via spin - dependent fluorescence of nv spin .",

    "the exchange interaction is negligible , and the main contribution comes from the dipole interaction . here , we consider a simple model radical pair reaction , namely the radical pair is created in the singlet state and recombine at the same rate @xmath203 for both singlet and triplet states , the dynamics of which can be described by the following master equation as @xmath204-\\frac{1}{2 } { \\left (   l_s^{\\dagger } l_s \\rho   +   \\rho l_s^{\\dagger } l_s -2 l_s \\rho l_s^{\\dagger }   \\right)}\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2 } { \\left (   l_t^{\\dagger } l_t \\rho   +   \\rho l_t^{\\dagger } l_t -2 l_t \\rho l_t^{\\dagger }   \\right)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath205 is the system hamiltonian that describes the interaction between two radicals and the coupling between nv spin and radicals when the radical pair is in the charge separated state , and the lindblad operators @xmath206 , @xmath207 describe the recombination of the singlet and triplet radical pair into the product state , which are written as @xmath208     between two radicals , the recombination rate is @xmath209 .",

    "the above master equation is equivalent to the conventional haberkorn approach @xcite .",
    "we apply the same idea as in the model of spin labels ( see section [ spinlabel : sec ] ) by applying an additional magnetic field and also continuously driving the radical spins to suppress the effect of surrounding nuclei .",
    "we assume the radical pair is created in the singlet state , so the resonant frequency near the driving rabi frequency @xmath3 is @xmath216 with @xmath156 ( the same as eq.([omega_3])).the charge recombination leads to the decay of the effective flip - flop rate .",
    "if the recombination rate is comparable or smaller than the coupling between nv spin and the radicals , it is possible to observe the resonance frequency , see an example in fig.[rpmsi ] ( a ) .",
    "therefore , if we tune the rabi frequency of nv spin at the resonant frequency , we can monitor the recombination of the radical pairs by observing the decay of the flip - flop rate .",
    "in other words , it can serve as an evidence for the charge recombination .",
    "we remark that this provides possibility to see chemical reaction process at a single molecule level and may give insights into how radicals recombine into the product states .",
    "we have proposed a scheme to construct a nano - scale single molecule spectrometer based on nv centers in diamond under continuous driving . this spectrometer is tunable by changing the rabi frequency .",
    "we demonstrate its application in the detection of a single nucleus , including its position and spin state . the idea can also be used to measure the distance and alignment of a spin pair .",
    "this opens a novel route to determine the structure of proteins and monitor conformational changes and other processes of relevance to biology , chemistry and medicine . we expect that our result and its extension can greatly enrich the diamond - based quantum technologies and their applications in chemistry and biology .",
    "the implementation of the present proposal of single molecule spectroscopy will benefit from the experimental developments including : shallow implanted nv centers in diamond @xcite , stable microwave driving fields @xcite and static magnetic field . a practical challenge when considering the biological applications",
    "is to localize the biomolecules properly on diamond surface and close to the nv centers .",
    "a theoretical challenge would be to calculate the resolution of the proposed microscope . meaning , if we have a few atoms of the same type the efficiency of resolving them would be an interesting theoretical problem in hamiltonian estimation which we intend to study .",
    "the nv center spin is coupled with a @xmath82 spin bath , the interaction is described as follows @xmath217},\\ ] ] where @xmath218 is the distance from the nv center to the nuclei , and @xmath151 is the unit vector that connects the nv center and nuclei .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin bath itself is @xmath219}.\\ ] ] where @xmath220 is the distance between two nuclei , and @xmath151 is the unit vector that connects two nuclei .",
    "as we want to single out the effect of the target system , we apply continuous driving field on the nv spin which satisfies the hatmann - hahn condition for the target nuclear spin . here , we use exact numerical simulation to show that continuous dynamical decoupling is very efficient for the parameters that we use for the examples in the main text , see fig.[c13 ] . due to the computational overhead , we only consider a diamond sample with @xmath221 @xmath82 spins in a 4 nm sphere to demonstrate the essential idea .",
