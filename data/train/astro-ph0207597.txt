    "whether there is a link between the intrinsic power of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and their host galaxies is not known .",
    "it seems plausible that more massive host galaxies might form in high density regions that also support the formation of more massive nuclear black holes @xcite and/or that more massive host galaxies could support an increased rate of fuelling . for nearby ,",
    "non - active galaxies there is observational evidence that the mass of the central supermassive black hole is correlated with bulge mass @xcite and with bulge velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "this could lead to an observable link between emission from the region around the black hole and the luminosity of the hosting galaxy , for example as observed by @xcite for local spheroids .",
    "several studies have indeed suggested nuclear luminosity might be related to host galaxy mass in agn @xcite ; however , other studies find no such relation @xcite .",
    "certainly among radio - loud agn alone , for which the host galaxies are generally luminous ellipticals with well - defined morphologies , no trend has been detected in previous studies",
    ". this may be due to the fact that only a small range of ( high ) nuclear power has been probed in the past .    to make a clean comparison among agn that differ only in nuclear output ( rather than host galaxy morphology , dust content , star formation history , etc . )",
    ", we restrict the present study to radio - loud agn ( @xmath8 ; kellerman _ et al .",
    "these are known to have relativistic jets formed near the central supermassive black hole @xcite , and so should be governed by similar physics near the black hole .",
    "additionally , the early - type spectral energy distributions typical of the host galaxies @xcite make the k corrections straightforward .",
    "our goal is to probe the connection between agn power ( processes near the black hole ) and environment ( host galaxy properties ) for radio - loud agn over the full range of intrinsic nuclear power . using bl lac objects and radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) to represent the extremes of this range",
    ", it is possible to define redshift - matched samples that span more than four orders of magnitude in intrinsic nuclear power .",
    "this range reflects a continuum of accretion powers , which in turn arise from some variation in the process of fuelling and/or jet formation near the black hole .",
    "the difficulty in comparing host galaxies over a wide range of nuclear power lies in the redshift selection bias .",
    "most low - power agn , namely fr  i radio galaxies and seyferts , are not found in complete samples beyond about @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , samples with large numbers of quasars extend to @xmath10 and beyond , and due to the steep luminosity functions of quasars , few appear at low redshift .",
    "indeed , in any flux - limited agn sample , there is an induced correlation between redshift and point - source luminosity .",
    "this can introduce apparent correlations between host galaxy and nuclear luminosities because galaxies evolve over even modest redshift ranges @xcite .",
    "if the redshift range is therefore restricted , the resulting sample will ordinarily span a narrow range in nuclear power , making it difficult to measure intrinsic trends that depend on nuclear power .",
    "we avoid this fundamental difficulty by selecting a low - power sample for which intrinsic luminosity of the point source is not well correlated with observed ( selection ) luminosity , and for which samples exist to high redshift , namely , bl lac objects .",
    "bl lacs are intrinsically low - power blazars whose close alignment with the line of sight results in strong relativistic beaming of the jet emission , in many cases resulting in magnification of @xmath11 times , and meaning that bl lacs can be found in large numbers beyond @xmath12 , to the same redshift range at which luminous quasars can be found in large numbers .",
    "their observed luminosity depends more on the doppler factor than on intrinsic luminosity , thus the sample studied has no observed correlation of ( intrinsic ) nuclear brightness with host galaxy brightness .",
    "we now describe the bl lac subsample and the rlq subsample selected for study .",
    "we carried out an extensive hst imaging survey of 110 bl lac objects with wfpc2 , primarily in the f702w ( r - band ) filter .",
    "these were a randomly selected subset of 132 bl lacs from six complete samples ( 4 x - ray- , 1 radio- , 1 optically - selected ) spanning the full range of observed bl lac spectral properties .",
    "the complete hst - observed subsample of 110 bl lacs covers a redshift range of @xmath13 .",
    "the host galaxy parameters were extracted by fitting a model galaxy profile plus a central point spread function ( psf ) to the azimuthally - averaged image profile .",
    "extensive testing on simulated data , and comparison to results from the two - dimensional analysis of a subsample has shown that this approach allows accurate measurement of the magnitude of both the host galaxy and nucleus and of the host galaxy scale radius , as well as allowing us to distinguish between a bulge- or disk - dominated galaxy profile . the excellent hst resolution proved to be vital in determination of the morphological parameters , as most of the critical information was within 0.5  1 arcseconds of the core .",
    "the full details of the image reduction and host galaxy fitting can be found in @xcite and the host galaxy results are presented in @xcite .",
    "host galaxies were resolved in @xmath14 of the sample , with @xmath15 resolved for @xmath16 , and none resolved for @xmath17 . all",
    "resolved host galaxies with sufficient signal - to - noise ratios were well - fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile ( i.e. , a bulge - dominated host ) , in preference to an exponential profile ( i.e. , a disk - dominated host ) .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that radio - loud agn reside in elliptical galaxies rather than spirals .",
    "the average k - corrected absolute magnitude of the host galaxies from the entire hst - imaged sample is @xmath18  mag ( rms dispersion ) .    to minimize the number of unresolved host galaxies ( while still maintaining a useful redshift range )",
    ", we restrict this sample to @xmath19 for this comparison study .",
    "we further restrict the sample to @xmath20 to match the available quasar subsample ( see below ) .",
    "the final low - power subsample consists of 40 objects with @xmath21 .      for the high - power comparison sample",
    "we take rlqs with published imaging data comparable in quality to the bl lac sample .",
    "we exclude high - power radio galaxies ( i.e. , fr  iis ) because their nuclear luminosities can not be measured directly due to obscuration @xcite .",
    "specifically , we limit the comparison sample to quasars that satisfy the following selection criteria :    * published results from hst imaging data are available . our extensive testing has shown that ground - based studies at intermediate redshifts can result in inconsistent measurements of host galaxy properties .",
    "the stability of the hst point spread function results in much more uniform data , and its superior resolution is critical for determining host morphological parameters . *",
    "restricted redshift range , @xmath22 . for this redshift range",
    "our detection rate of bl lac host galaxies was @xmath15 , so there is minimal bias against faint hosts with bright nuclei .",
    "* host galaxies detected for full sample studied .",
    "that is , @xmath23% of the rlqs with @xmath19 in the published sample must have resolved host galaxies .",
    "as above , this avoids bias against low host - nuclear luminosity ratios .",
    "we identified four quasar studies meeting these criteria : dunlop et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , 10 objects ; boyce et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , 3 objects ; hooper et al . (",
    "1997 ) , 6 objects ; and bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , 6 objects ( see table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "the lowest rlq redshift is @xmath24 , so we restrict the comparison sample to @xmath25 .",
    "the final high - power sample consists of 22 rlqs ( three rlqs have duplicate observations ) .",
    "the bl lac and rlq subsamples have indistinguishable redshift distributions , with a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicating a @xmath26 probability of the same parent population .",
    "thus the fundamental distinction between the two samples is nuclear luminosity .      in order to compare the host galaxy properties measured in different studies , we first convert all results to the cousin s r band , which is closest to the hst f702w filter . for consistency , we also used same cosmology as @xcite : @xmath27  km / s / mpc and @xmath28 .",
    "the spectral corrections were made using a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) derived from galaxy synthesis models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 , and private communication ) .",
    "redshifted seds were convolved with the transmission curves for both the cousin s r and the observed bands , and then normalised to the published host galaxy magnitudes .",
    "an early - type spectrum was assumed for all hosts , with a passively evolving population of age 8  gyrs .",
    "uncertainties in the spectral corrections are small because we are converting between similar filters .",
    "the uncertainties are highest in the case of the bahcall _ et al . _",
    "sample , of order a tenth of a magnitude , where we are correcting between the f606w filter ( v band ) and r band .",
    "thus variations among the particular seds of different host galaxies should not affect our results significantly . the corrected cousin",
    "s r absolute magnitudes for the high - power subsample are given in table  1 .",
    "we used the average values for the two rlqs with duplicate observations .",
    "the median k - corrected absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies of the subsamples differ slightly : @xmath29  mag for the low - power subsample and @xmath30  mag for the high - power subsample , with about half a magnitude of scatter about their means , which are @xmath31  mag and @xmath32  mag respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows host galaxy absolute magnitude plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "the distributions of two subsamples overlap completely , though the low - power subsample tends to have slightly fainter ( but still quite luminous ) host galaxies .",
    "a k - s test indicates that the host galaxy magnitudes of these two subsamples are ( marginally ) unlikely to be drawn from the same parent luminosity distribution ( 4% probability ) .",
    "in general , the host galaxies of the radio - loud agn in this sample have similar luminosities to brightest cluster galaxies ( @xmath33  mag ; thuan & puschell 1989 ) . at their faintest",
    "they are @xmath34  mag above @xmath35 ( @xmath36  mag ; efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) .",
    "this places them within normal bounds for non - active elliptical galaxies , albeit at the bright end of the luminosity distribution .",
    "every host galaxy in this sample for which the morphological parameters were measured ( @xmath37 of the sample ) was preferentially fit ( and well fit ) by a de vaucouleur s profile , suggesting that they are in fact elliptical galaxies .",
    "normal ( non - active ) ellipticals exhibit a tight relationship between the log of effective radius ( @xmath2 ) and surface brightness at that radius ( @xmath1 ) , the so - called kormendy relation ( @xmath38 ; kormendy 1977 ) , a projection of the fundamental plane .",
    "the slope and intercept of this relation depend on stellar dynamics ( via the velocity dispersion , which is not known for this sample ) and galaxy shape , size , and luminosity ( which are measured ) .",
    "if the kormendy relations for this sample are similar to that of normal elliptical galaxies , then these host galaxies are likely to be dynamically similar to normal galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the kormendy relations for the host galaxies of the two subsamples ( only 16 rlqs had published effective radii ) . performing a two - dimensional k - s test @xcite",
    ", we find that these subsamples are consistent with having been drawn from the same parent distribution ( @xmath39 probability ) .",
    "the best - fit linear relations are @xmath40  mag / arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "for the low - power subsample , and @xmath42  mag / arcsec@xmath41 for the high - power subsample .",
    "the quoted errors are the one - sigma confidence levels for the linear fit .",
    "no published errors were available for the high - power subsample , so a conservative @xmath43mag / arcsec@xmath41 and @xmath44 were used for @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively when calculating the linear fits .",
    "these two relations are consistent within error , and remain so even if we assume much smaller errors in @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the high - power sample .",
    "the r - band kormendy relation for normal ellipticals in the local universe reported by @xcite is @xmath45 , consistent within the errors with both the low- and high - power subsamples , especially if we take into account the evolution of the intercept with redshift ( @xmath46 to @xmath47  mag / arcsec@xmath41 at the median sample redshift of @xmath48 ; treu _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) .",
    "comparison of extended radio power between bl lac objects and rlqs verifies their difference in intrinsic power .",
    "extended radio power provides rough bolometer of time - integrated power of the nucleus , independent of relativistic beaming of the jet emission .",
    "the median extended radio power of the low - power sources is @xmath49  w  hz@xmath50 , compared to @xmath51  w  hz@xmath50 for the high - power sources : a difference of 2.4 orders of magnitude . over four orders of magnitude separate the least radio - powerful bl lacs from the most radio - powerful rlqs .",
    "yet host galaxy luminosities span less than one order of magnitude ( @xmath52  mag )",
    ".    extended radio power is partly dependent on the age of the source and on the properties of the host galaxy through which the radio - emitting jet must pass .",
    "a more direct measure of power of the nucleus is the total luminosity emitted by the nucleus , which can sometimes be estimated from its observed optical brightness .",
    "however , in bl lac objects , strong relativistic beaming ( which allowed us to select this matched redshift sample ) enhances the perceived brightness by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the kinematic doppler factor of the emitting jet plasma . to correct for beaming we use published estimates of doppler factors from two blazar studies : @xcite , in which lower limits on the doppler factor are calculated from measurements of bulk motion in the radio jet , and @xcite , in which lower limits to @xmath54 are calculated from measurements of the ratio of @xmath55- to x - ray photons , assuming a synchrotron self - compton model .",
    "these two studies give lower limits of doppler factors for eight of our 40 bl lac objects .",
    "to estimate the nuclear brightnesses of the remaining sources we use the median value of @xmath56 .",
    "this is both the median of the eight bl lacs in this sample and also the median of the measured doppler factors for the original hst - imaged sample of 110 bl lacs , so is likely to be representative of the class .",
    "although beaming may affect the luminosities of the rlq sample to some degree , its effect will be small in comparison to the bl lac objects given the dominance of the thermal emission associated with the accretion disk in rlqs .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows absolute host galaxy magnitude versus absolute nuclear magnitude for the low- and high - power subsamples .",
    "the bl lac nuclear magnitudes have been k corrected and corrected for beaming , with the lower limits in the doppler factors translating to upper limits in nuclear luminosities .",
    "the median absolute nuclear magnitude for the 8 bl lacs with measured doppler factor limits is @xmath57  mag , while for the entire low - power subsample it is @xmath58  mag . for the high - power sources ( k corrected only ) the median absolute magnitude is @xmath59  mag .",
    "at least four orders of magnitude separate the least powerful bl lacs ( @xmath60  mag ) and the most luminous rlqs ( @xmath61  mag ) .",
    "although the host galaxies of the low - power sample span a similar range in magnitude to those of the high - power sample , they are on average slightly fainter .",
    "this leads to a shallow trend between the host galaxy and nuclear luminosities across the combined sample .",
    "we calculated the kendall s @xmath62 correlation coefficient , censoring the upper limits in the beaming - corrected bl lac nuclear luminosities ( and for four of their host luminosities ) .",
    "the trend was significant for the case where we include the entire low - power subsample , beaming - corrected with the median doppler factor ( 0.01% probability of no correlation ; kendall s ( @xmath62 ) for 62 points : 0.555 ) , and for the case where we include only those of the low - power subsample with measured doppler factor limits ( 0.5% probability of no correlation ; kendall ( @xmath62 ) for 30 points : 0.671 ) .",
    "although this trend is statistically significant , it is also very shallow . performing a linear fit with the high - power subsample combined with the non - beaming - corrected low - power subsample , we find that the host galaxy luminosity increases by only @xmath63  mag for an increase of @xmath64  mag in the luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "any introduction of beaming correction decreases this gradient further . applying the median doppler factor corrections to the low - power subsample yields an increase in @xmath65  mag in the nuclear luminosity for each magnitude of host galaxy luminosity .",
    "the shallowness of this trend , and the narrow range in luminosity exhibited by these host galaxies demonstrates that , for radio - loud agn , the luminosity ( and hence mass ) of the host galaxy has little relation to the energy output of the nucleus . if the correlation between bulge luminosity and central black hole mass observed in nearby , non - active galaxies @xcite also applies to these host galaxies , then this tight range of host luminosities implies a small range of ( very high ) black hole masses , and hence a very large range of eddington ratios . in the following sections we derive these eddington ratios using two different methods for estimating the black hole masses .      since the host galaxies of radio - loud agn appear to be normal ellipticals in every respect measured ( see sect .",
    "[ host ] ) , it is plausible that the agn black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity are correlated , as observed in nearby , non - active galaxies @xcite .",
    "if so , radio - loud agn are powered by very massive central black holes .",
    "we use the relation presented by @xcite to calculate these :    @xmath66    assuming an early - type spectrum to derive @xmath67 from the r - band magnitudes ( see sect .  [ phot ] ) , we find median black hole masses of @xmath68 ( mean : @xmath69 ) for the low - power subsample , and @xmath70 ( mean : @xmath71 ) for the high - power subsample , with standard deviations @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the median for the entire sample is @xmath74 , with standard deviation @xmath75 ( mean : @xmath69 ) .",
    "the upper part of figure  [ fig4 ] shows the derived black hole masses versus ( corrected ) magnitude of the nucleus .",
    "the error in black hole mass is dominated by the scatter in the @xmath76@xmath77 relation ( the rms dispersion is a factor of 2.8 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) , but also affected by the uncertainty in the host galaxy magnitudes and in the spectral corrections ( a factor of @xmath78 ) .",
    "the shallow correlation noted between the luminosities of host galaxy and nucleus ( sect .",
    "[ hostnuc ] ) leads to a correlation between black hole mass and nuclear luminosity ; however , when we include the error bars in the black hole masses , the correlation is not statistically significant",
    ".    given agn black hole masses estimated in this way , we can derive the eddington luminosity :    @xmath79    where @xmath76 is the black hole mass , @xmath80 the mass of the proton , and @xmath81 the thompson cross - section .",
    "from this we calculate the eddington ratio using the corrected nuclear magnitudes , assuming a spectral index of @xmath82 to estimate bolometric luminosity .",
    "the nuclear magnitudes of bl lac objects are corrected for beaming using lower limits to the doppler factors , meaning the calculated eddington ratios are upper limits .    for the eight bl lacs with measured doppler factor limits ,",
    "the median eddington ratio limit is @xmath83 .",
    "for the entire low - power sample , corrected with the median doppler factor , we obtain @xmath84 .",
    "the median eddington ratio for the high - power sources is much higher , with @xmath85 .",
    "the upper part of figure  [ fig5 ] shows the histogram of eddington ratios ( or eddington ratio limits ) for the reduced low - power sample and the high - power sample .",
    "black hole mass appears to be much more tightly correlated with velocity dispersion ( @xmath86 ) than with bulge luminosity @xcite .",
    "if we assume that our host galaxies lie on the fundamental plane for normal ellipticals , we can infer velocity dispersions using the measured values of @xmath2 and @xmath87  the mean surface brightness within @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , as we know that these host galaxies are indistinguishable from normal elliptical galaxies morphologically , and from ",
    "[ host ] we know that they are consistent dynamically , with their kormendy relations matching .",
    "we use the fundamental plane parameters measured by @xcite from r - band photometry of a large sample of e and s0 galaxies across several clusters :    @xmath88    the evolution of the zero point , @xmath55 , with redshift is calculated using the measurements of fundamental plane parameters at different redshifts by @xcite , yielding @xmath89 .",
    "the velocity dispersions derived were used to calculate black hole masses using the relation :    @xmath90    the value of the exponent is somewhat uncertain , with conflicting measurements in the literature .",
    "@xcite measure an @xmath91 , while @xcite measure @xmath92 . to reflect this uncertainty ,",
    "we adopt a mean value of @xmath93 with an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation of the two values : @xmath94 .",
    "the median black hole masses derived using this method are , for the low - power sample : @xmath95 ( mean : @xmath96 ) ; and for the high - power sample : @xmath97 ( mean : @xmath71 ) .",
    "black hole masses derived with this method show a greater spread than those derived using the @xmath76@xmath77 relation , with standard deviations @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "the median for the entire sample is @xmath100(mean : @xmath101 ) , with standard deviation @xmath102 .",
    "the lower part of figure  [ fig4 ] shows black hole mass versus the magnitude of the nucleus for the masses derived in this section .",
    "the errors in the black hole masses are dominated by the scatter in the fundamental plane relation , which is around 25% in @xmath86 for a given @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath1 and @xmath2 affect the errors to a lesser extent , and the errors in the actual fundamental plane fit parameters are small in comparison .",
    "the assumed error in @xmath103 , although leading to differences of only @xmath104 in black hole mass , compounds with the error in @xmath86 . as a result , although the scatter in the @xmath76@xmath86 relation is small , the final errors in the black hole masses calculated by this method are of similar order to those calculated from the @xmath76@xmath77 relation .",
    "again , taking these errors into account , there is no statistically significant trend between black hole masses derived in this section and nuclear luminosity , beaming corrected or otherwise .",
    "the median eddington ratio limit for the eight bl lacs with measured doppler factor limits is @xmath105 , while the median for the entire low - power subsample is @xmath84 .",
    "again , these eddington ratios are a great deal smaller than the median for the high - power sample calculated by this method : @xmath106 .",
    "the lower part of figure  [ fig5 ] shows the histogram of the eddington ratios calculated in this section .",
    "the results from the two methods of black hole mass calculation agree : radio - loud agn are powered by very massive central black holes , typically with @xmath107 , and more often with @xmath108 .",
    "these results are generally consistent with the black hole masses derived for luminous radio - loud agn in other studies .",
    "@xcite find masses in the range @xmath109 to @xmath110 for their sample of 7 low - redshift ( @xmath111 ) bl lacs , calculated from spectroscopic measurements of stellar velocity dispersion . these fall within the range of masses found for our sample of bl lacs via the velocity dispersion relation ,",
    "although they tend toward the low - mass end of that range . this may indicate an evolutionary or selection effect between the two epochs studied .",
    "@xcite find black hole masses in the range @xmath112 to @xmath113 for a sample of 22 radio - loud quasars , determined through reverberation mapping .",
    "these are consistent with the masses found for our high - power sample .",
    "our results support the idea that , although some radio - quiet objects may host very massive central black holes @xcite , luminous radio sources may require them .",

    "suggest a black hole mass threshold for radio - loud agn of @xmath114 , which is supported by the black hole masses derived from bulge luminosity in this study .",
    "masses derived in this study via the @xmath76@xmath86 relation suggest a threshold of @xmath115 .",
    "whatever its value , we find that neither the threshold nor the distribution of black hole masses in radio - loud agn depends on the actual level of radio emission , within the range represented by these radio sources , or on the overall energy output of the nucleus .    as a consequence , radio - loud agn exhibit an extremely broad range of accretion rates ; from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "across this range the host galaxies span a remarkably tight range of high stellar luminosities  all within one magnitude of brightest cluster galaxies  suggesting that , at least for radio - loud agn , there is at most a very weak relation between the properties of the host galaxy and both the overall rate and the efficiency of fuelling of the black hole .",
    "we find that the host galaxies of radio - loud agn are luminous ellipticals , occupying the low surface - brightness tail of the kormendy relation for normal elliptical galaxies , and are statistically consistent with this relation . comparing the host galaxies of low - power and high - power radio - loud agn , we find general overlap , with a slight difference in median absolute cousins r magnitudes , @xmath118  mag and @xmath119  mag , respectively . after correcting the ( highly beamed ) low - power agn for doppler beaming , we find a significant positive trend between nuclear and host galaxy luminosity , but with a very shallow slope  a factor of 1.3 in host galaxy brightness over at least four orders of magnitude in nuclear luminosity  ruling out a close relation between host galaxy and nuclear luminosity in radio - loud agn .",
    "we find that the central black holes of luminous radio - loud agn are universally large , with median black hole mass @xmath120 for this sample .",
    "this is found to be the case using either the @xmath76@xmath77 relation and the @xmath76@xmath86 relations to derive black hole masses .",
    "this supports the view that a high central black hole mass is an important factor in generating a powerful radio source .",
    "no correlation is found between black hole mass and energy output from the nucleus .",
    "rather , the black hole masses derived span a surprisingly small range compared to the range in intrinsic power of this sample .",
    "eddington ratios for radio - loud agn span more than four orders of magnitude , with @xmath121 in the lowest - power sources to @xmath122 in the highest . across this range , the host galaxies luminosities",

    "<S> we have studied the host galaxies of a sample of radio - loud agn spanning more than four decades in the energy output of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the core sample includes 40 low - power sources ( bl lac objects ) and 22 high - power sources ( radio - loud quasars ) spanning the redshift range @xmath0 , all imaged with the high spatial resolution of hst . </S>",
    "<S> all of the sources are found to lie in luminous elliptical galaxies , which follow the kormendy relation for normal ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> a very shallow trend is detected between nuclear brightness ( corrected for beaming ) and host galaxy luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> black hole masses are estimated for the entire sample , using both the bulge luminosity  </S>",
    "<S> black hole mass and the velocity dispersion  </S>",
    "<S> black hole mass relations for local galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the latter involves a new method , using the host galaxy morphological parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , to infer the velocity dispersion , @xmath3 , via the fundamental plane correlation . </S>",
    "<S> both methods indicate that the entire sample of radio - loud agn are powered by very massive central black holes , with @xmath4 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> eddington ratios range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , with the high - power sources having higher eddington ratios than the low - power sources . </S>",
    "<S> overall , radio - loud agn appear to span a very large range in accretion efficiency , which is all but independent of the mass of the host galaxy . </S>"
