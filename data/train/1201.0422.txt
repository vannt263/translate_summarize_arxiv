    "the topological charge of gauge field theory is defined as @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to the field strength tensor and its dual , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) contains nontrivial gauge configurations carrying the topological charge with an integer number@xcite .",
    "these configurations interpolate between the topologically different vacua of qcd characterized by different chern - simons numbers . for a long time the experimental evidence for the existence of the topological gluon configurations only comes indirectly from the meson spectrum@xcite .",
    "recently , the study of the chiral magnetic effect(cme)@xcite has received much attentions since the topological configurations of qcd may be observed directly in the noncentral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the essence of the cme is the chiral imbalance induced by the nonzero topological charge through the axial anomaly of qcd @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the quark number of the right - handed(left - handed ) chirality in the chiral limit .",
    "( [ eq : int1aaa ] ) indicates the chiral asymmetry is generated by the nonzero topological excitations . in a strong magnetic field which may be produced in the noncentral heavy - ion collisions , a net electric current will be induced along the direction of the magnetic field due to the chirality imbalance .    in order to study the effect of the chiral asymmetry ,",
    "usually the axial chemical potential @xmath6 is introduced in a grand canonical ensemble@xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath6 is the difference of the right- and left - handed quark chemical potentials .",
    "this quantity can be identified as the time derivative of the @xmath7 angle of qcd , namely @xmath8@xcite . in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath9 ,",
    "the analytical expression of the induced electric current density for the cme at finite @xmath6 has been given in @xcite which takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "note that all quarks carrying the same electric charge is assumed in .",
    "obviously , this equation explicitly breaks the @xmath12- and @xmath13-symmetry .",
    "equation.([eq : jz - zeroga ] ) indicates that the hot quark - gluon plasma(hqgp ) is an ideal place to study the physics of @xmath12- and @xmath13-odd excitations of qcd .",
    "first , the production probability of the configurations with nonzero winding numbers becomes higher since jumping over the potential barrier between distinct classical vacua is probable at high temperatures .",
    "the configurations responsible for such thermal transitions are called sphalerons@xcite in qcd , which might occur at a copious rate at high temperature compared to the low - temperature tunneling by the instanton .",
    "second , a strong magnetic field can be produced in non - central heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",
    "the study based on the urqmd model@xcite suggests that the @xmath14 produced at rhic and lhc can be as large as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 . ] .",
    "so in a noncentral heavy - ion collision , the induced electric current may lead to an excess of the positive electric charge on one side of the reaction plane and the negative electric charge on the other .",
    "such a charge separation effect may be observed experimentally .",
    "recently , a conclusive observation of charge azimuthal correlation has been presented by the star collaboration @xcite which may result from the cme with local @xmath12- and @xmath13-violation .    theoretically , the investigation of the cme has been performed recently in the lattice qcd simulation by introducing a finite @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the lattice simulation at finite axial chemical potential is that there is no sign problem comparing with the case at finite baryon chemical potential . in this study ,",
    "the cme described by eq . has been confirmed qualitatively .",
    "but at the quantitative level , the obtained electric current density is significantly suppressed @xcite compared to the analytical formula ( [ eq : jz - zeroga ] ) .",
    "the further study at the quenched level of qcd suggests that the lattice data are sensitive to the lattice spacing@xcite and the obtained data increase significantly compared to the ones in@xcite .",
    "however , the deviation of the new lattice data from the analytical formula is still sizable even some systematic errors have been taking into account@xcite .",
    "the suppression of the lattice data may stem from some errors of the lattice simulation and/or the non - perturbative effects of qcd . accordingly , besides taking more improved lattice calculations , physically understanding the current lattice result through other methods of qcd is very important and necessary . on the other hand , due to the limitation of the lattice calculation , investigating the non - perturbative corrections and making new predictions on the cme",
    "are also very required by using the effective theories or models of qcd .",
    "the purpose of this paper has two aspects : first , we will try to disclose the possible mechanism for the deviation of the present lattice data from the analytical result by taking into account some qcd corrections ; second , we will explore the non - perturbative influence of the instanton molecules on the cme and make some predictions .",
    "note that both aspects are closely related to the effective four - quark interaction in the axial - vector channel , where the chirality density - density correlation plays an important role .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : effective ] , we give the effective quark interactions of qcd for @xmath18 . in section",
    "[ sec : correction ] , we present the correction to the cme from the axial - vector interaction . section [ sec : numerical ] is devoted to the numerical results and related discussions .",
    "the last section is the summary and conclusion .",
    "the experimental data of rhic suggests that strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma(sqgp ) is formed for @xmath18 , which exhibits the behavior of a perfect fluid .",
    "now it is widely believed that the non - perturbative qcd still plays very important roles on the hqgp up to @xmath19 . since the chiral magnetic effect may be observed directly in heavy - ion collisions",
    ", one naturally expects that the role of the non - perturbative aspects of qcd on the cme should be quite remarkable .",
    "one of the possible non - perturbative effects may arise from the instanton - anti - instanton ( @xmath20 ) molecules at finite temperature near @xmath21 .    as a major component of the qcd vacuum",
    ", the instantons can produce the quark condensate , the low - lying hadron state and other non - perturbative features of qcd , according to the interacting instanton liquid model ( iilm ) @xcite . at zero and low temperatures ,",
    "the instanton ensemble is in a random liquid state which is responsible for the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the axial anomaly .",
    "naively one would expect that the instantons might give a little contribution to the cme due to their significant suppression at high temperature .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the hot chiral transition is not driven by the vanishing of the instantons and anti - instantons but by their rearrangement around @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "namely , when approaching to @xmath21 from below , the random instantons and anti - instantons are paired up into the ordered @xmath20molecules .",
    "this picture implies that the instantons still keeps sizable density near @xmath21 with the molecular forms .",
    "moreover , a recent investigation indicates that the @xmath20molecules can even survive up to @xmath22@xcite .",
    "the rearrangement picture indicates that the non - perturbative effects induced by the instanton configurations will persist into the high temperature region . in the chiral symmetric phase",
    ", the interacting @xmath20molecules can be regarded as one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the sqgp formed in @xmath23@xcite .",
    "so even the chiral restoration is one of the necessary conditions for the appearance of the electric current @xmath24 , the instantons may still exert important influence on the chiral magnetic effect via the molecular forms .",
    "it is well known that the random instanton configurations can lead to the famous t hooft interactions among quarks with different flavors @xmath25 which explicitly breaks the @xmath26 symmetry due to the axial anomaly .",
    "similarly , the ordered @xmath20molecules also result in effective quark interactions , but only with the four - fermion coupling forms . for two - flavor case , the fierz - invariant quark interactions induced by @xmath20molecules has been derived in @xcite with the form @xmath27\\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac{2}{n^2_{c}}(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5\\psi)^2-\\frac{1}{2n^2_{c}}\\sum_{a=0}^{3}[(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{a}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\psi)^2\\nonumber\\\\   & + ( \\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{a}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5\\psi)^2 ]   \\big\\}+\\mathcal{l}_8 , \\label{eq : molecule}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unit and pauli matrices in flavor space respectively and @xmath30 is the coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath31 in refers the quark interactions in the color octet channel . in the @xmath20molecular picture",
    ", it is expected that the dominant quark interactions for @xmath18 are the molecular ones rather than the t hooft interactions @xcite region according to @xcite .",
    "such interactions should have little influence on the cme since the electric current only appears in the chirally symmetric phase . ] .",
    "different from ( [ eq : thooft ] ) , the lagrangian respects not only the @xmath32 symmetry but also the @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "this is because the @xmath20pair gives vanishing topological charges@xcite .",
    "note that the most general fierz - invariant form for the four - quark interactions under the invariance of @xmath34 symmetry including both the scalar(psudo - scalar ) and vector(axial - vector ) currents is @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2}g_2\\sum_{a=0}^{3}[(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{a}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\psi)^2+(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{a}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5\\psi)^2]\\nonumber\\\\   & -\\frac{1}{2}g_3[(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{0}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\psi)^2+(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{0}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5\\psi)^2]\\nonumber\\\\   & -\\frac{1}{2}g_4[(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{0}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\psi)^2-(\\bar{\\psi}\\tau^{0}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_5\\psi)^2]+\\mathcal{l}^{(4)}_{8 } ,   \\label{eq : full4f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are four independent coupling constants @xcite .",
    "comparing with , one can find that the interacting @xmath37 molecule model ( iimm ) gives prediction of these coupling constants with @xmath38 which are all dependent on the only parameter @xmath30 .",
    "we shall show below that nonzero @xmath39 and @xmath40 give nontrivial contributions to the induced current @xmath24 for the cme .",
    "we stress that even we are very interested in the possible non - perturbative influence of the instantons on the cme , we do not limit our study within the only formalism , which is just a special case of . without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume that the lagrangian density with the four - quark interactions works for @xmath23 .",
    "this lagrangian can be regarded as an extension of the traditional njl model of qcd ( in the next section , the degree of freedom of the polyakov - loop is also included ) .    for the physics related to the cme",
    ", we are particularly interested in the effective four - quark interactions in the vector isospin - scalar and axial - vector isospin - scalar channels @xmath41 which appears in both and .",
    "the significance of @xmath42 to the cme is attributed to the appearance of two special vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the chirally asymmetric system under the influence of an external magnetic field @xmath9 , namely , @xmath43 and @xmath44@xcite .",
    "the former is the vev of the vector current @xmath45 along the direction of @xmath9 and the latter the chiral charge density conjugate to @xmath6 . as a consequence",
    ", the chiral magnetic effect might be sensitive to the couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 in .",
    "the prediction of the iimm gives @xmath48 equation indicates two unconventional points induced by the @xmath20molecules : ( 1 ) the vector interaction is attractive while the negative @xmath49 implies that the axial - vector interaction is repulsive ; ( 2 ) the magnitude of @xmath49 is three times that of @xmath50 ( for the totally polarized case , the coupling @xmath49 in the temporal direction is even 12 times that of @xmath50@xcite ) .",
    "this is quite different from the conventional four - quark interactions derived from the fierz transformation of the colored quark - antiquark current - current interaction @xmath51 which arises from the one gluon exchange approximation ( ogea ) of qcd . in the ogea ,",
    "both @xmath50 and @xmath49 are positive with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coupling constant in the scalar iso - scalar channel .",
    "note that it is very likely that the effective quark interactions stemming from the ogea can persist into the non - perturbative region of qcd with relatively strong couplings .",
    "a well - known example in the literature is the global color model ( gcm ) of qcd , which is based on the nonlocal colored quark - antiquark current - current interaction @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a function of the strong coupling@xcite .",
    "this model can successfully describe the low - lying hadrons@xcite and give reasonable qcd condensates in the vacuum and at finite temperature and density@xcite .    since the axial - vector interaction may be repulsive ( as in the iimm ) or attractive ( as in the ogea or gcm )",
    ", we will treat the coupling @xmath49 in as a free parameter .",
    "the realistic @xmath49 may include contributions from both the @xmath20molecules and the ogea , which should depend on the temperature in general . on the other hand , since the vector interaction is attractive in both the iimm and gcm , we only consider the positive @xmath50 in the following .",
    "working at the mean field level , the lagrangian can be rewritten as @xmath56 we can read two nontrivial points from eq .. first , both squared terms of the condensates @xmath57 and @xmath58 give contributions to the thermodynamical potential .",
    "second , the four - quark interactions in the axial - vector and vector channels lead to a dynamical axial chemical potential @xmath59 , and an effective gauge field @xmath60 along the direction of @xmath9 , respectively . note that both points are not taken into account in @xcite to derive the analytical formula for the cme current .    to investigate the dynamical influence of @xmath42 on the cme , we add the kinetic lagrangian for free - interacting quarks , namely @xmath61 to the lagrangian .",
    "we will work in the chiral limit throughout this paper . to describe the confinement - deconfinement transition of qcd",
    ", we also include the dynamics of the polyakov - loop , the action of which in the pure gauge theory denotes as @xmath62 .",
    "our model can be looked as the polyakov - loop - enhanced iimm but with a varying axial - vector coupling @xmath49 . in form",
    ", it is very similar to the so called two - flavor pnjl model@xcite .",
    "one then gets the mean field thermodynamical potential @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the uv regulator function . @xmath66 and @xmath67 in correspond to the normalized traced polyakov loop and its hermitean conjugate respectively . in",

    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 refer to the effective axial chemical potential and the modified momentum along @xmath76 respectively , namely @xmath77 the current @xmath78 , the chirality density @xmath79 , the quark condensate for nonzero @xmath6 . ] @xmath80 and the vev of the polyakov - loop @xmath66 can be determined self - consistently by solving the saddle point equations @xmath81    note that the influence of @xmath50 on the cme has been investigated in @xcite , where only the vector interaction is introduced phenomenologically .",
    "the main conclusion is that @xmath50 may lead to a dielectric correction to the cme current density @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "when including the axial - vector interaction , the dispersion relation suggests that eq . will be further modified as @xmath84    however , a subtlety on the calculation of the polarization tensor or susceptibility in @xcite has been pointed out by kenji fukushima @xcite : according to eqs.(8 - 10 ) in @xcite , the quantity @xmath85 should be zero since the corresponding static susceptibility @xmath86 is always vanishing .",
    "this implies that the vector interaction does not give any correction to the cme .",
    "actually , this point is also consistent with the nielsen - ninomiya s argument @xcite which is only based on the nonrenormalization of triangle anomalies and the energy conservation . as shown in eq .",
    "( or eq . ) , the nonzero @xmath85 will lead to a modification of the coefficient before @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 in our case ) . nevertheless , the argument proposed by nielsen and ninomiya @xcite does not support the coefficient receiving any correction .",
    "this is because such a coefficient is determined by the the nonrenormalization of triangle anomalies , which is known exactly due to the topological nature of anomalies ( more details of this argument see the first part of sec .",
    "iii in @xcite ) .    in light of this ,",
    "the correct formula for the current density should be @xmath89 rather than eq . when considering the axial - vector interaction .",
    "we note that , unlike eqs . and , eq . does not contradict nielsen - ninomiya s argument .",

    "iii in @xcite but with the replacement of @xmath92 with @xmath74 .    in the following",
    ", we will ignore the vector interaction and only consider the effect of the axial - vector interaction on the cme .",
    "using the method @xmath93 and the replacement @xmath94 one can get the integral expression for the calculation of the electric current density in the two - flavor case @xmath95 \\;.",

    "ignoring the correction from @xmath50 , the induced electric current density @xmath24 for the two - flavor case under the influence of @xmath49 becomes @xmath96 as it should be , eq .",
    "indicates that the induced electric current density is ultraviolet finite .    unlike the analytical formula",

    "we note that even the formula is obtained from the lll integration , it does nt mean that @xmath24 only depends on the lll for nonzero @xmath49 since the high landau levels also give contributions to the chirality density @xmath58 .",
    "the modified expression of @xmath24 implies that the induced electric current density under the influence of the axial - vector interaction may deviate from the analytical result in the following aspects .",
    "first , the current density @xmath24 is no longer directly proportional to the axial chemical potential @xmath6 and the magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "the reason is that in general , the dynamical chemical potential @xmath99 does nt linearly depend on @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "second , @xmath99 is @xmath100-dependent ( since @xmath49 and @xmath58 are both @xmath100-dependent ) , so the current density @xmath24 also depends on the temperature .",
    "third , the iimm predicts that the cme will be enhanced significantly : ( 1 ) @xmath99 has the same sign as @xmath6 because of the negative @xmath49 ; ( 2 ) @xmath99 may be sizable since @xmath49 is strong as @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the ogea ( or gcm ) predicts that the cme will be weakened by the attractive axial - vector interaction compared to the analytical result .",
    "in this section , we provide numerical results for the influence of the axial - vector interaction on the chirally imbalanced matter in a constant magnetic field .",
    "the coupling @xmath53 , the uv regulator function @xmath101 and the polyakov - loop model @xmath62 in ( [ eq : omega ] ) are all adopted from @xcite , in which the pnjl model was used to study the cme .",

    "this feature is also in agreement with our results for the attractive axial - vector interaction , as shown in fig.[fig:2 ] and fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "( 3 ) one set of data ( @xmath145 with @xmath146 ) in fig.7 of @xcite indicates that the coefficient @xmath135 decreases with growing @xmath100 .",
    "the author has argued that such a behavior might be a lattice artifact .",
    "however , that the induced current density @xmath24 may be suppressed by @xmath100 can be well interpreted by the attractive coupling @xmath49 as demonstrated in fig.[fig:3 ] . according to fig.7 of @xcite , the ratio @xmath105 decreases from @xmath147 to @xmath148 when",
    "increasing @xmath100 from @xmath149 to @xmath150 ; or in other words , the ratio @xmath105 decreases roughly by @xmath151 per @xmath152 .",
    "this is not so far away from the decline rate @xmath153 per @xmath152 for @xmath128 , as indicated in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "should change more mildly since the coupling @xmath49 becomes weaker with increasing @xmath100 .",
    "] so to judge whether the coefficient @xmath135 is sensitive to the temperature or not needs more detailed lattice investigation .    on the contrary",
    ", the iimm predicts that the cme current or the coefficient @xmath135 will be enhanced by the @xmath20molecules .",
    "clearly , this prediction deviates distinctly from the present lattice data .",
    "this might suggest that the dominant axial - vector interaction for @xmath18 is coming from the ogea .",
    "nevertheless , the current lattice simulation is still rough and far from conclusive(at leat at the quantitative level ) .",
    "first , that the current lattice data are sensitive to the lattice spacing @xcite suggests that the continuum limit is very important for quantitatively understanding the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "second , the main simulations in @xcite are still at the quenched level while the discretization error of the fermion action is larger than that of the gauge action . therefore , more improved quantitative lattice investigation will shed light on the role of the @xmath20molecules on the chiral magnetic effect .    in any case",
    ", we stress that , due to the contribution of the dynamical axial chemical potential , the lattice result of the induced current for a finite @xmath6 does nt need to be quantitatively consistent with the analytical formula . if no other qcd modifications , the coefficient @xmath135 or the ratio @xmath106 should be greater ( less ) than the standard analytical value for @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the chiral tricritical point ( tcp ) on the @xmath0 phase diagram has been found in @xcite , which locates at the relatively larger @xmath6 region ( in the chiral limit for vanishing quark number density ) .",
    "the tcp is also confirmed in the linear sigma model , whose location is very close to the @xmath100-axis@xcite .",
    "these studies show that the @xmath0 phase diagram is somehow similar to the @xmath154 phase diagram of qcd .    here",
    "we will demonstrate the role of the axial - vector interaction on the @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "we are particularly interested in its influence on the tcp . in fig.[fig:5 ] , we show the locations of the tcp for different axial - vector interactions . we see that the tcp is quite sensitive to the axial - vector coupling .",
    "the negative @xmath49 shifts the tcp towards the smaller @xmath6 region while the positive @xmath49 moves it towards the larger @xmath6 area .",
    "this implies that the first - order chiral transition is strengthened by the repulsive axial - vector interaction induced by @xmath20 molecules while weakened by the attractive axial - vector interaction stemming from the ogea .",
    "the locations of the chiral tcp in the @xmath0 plane for different @xmath49.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    it is well - known that the attractive vector interaction can soften the chiral transition and move the critical point(cp ) towards the larger @xmath98 area via generating a dynamical quark chemical potential @xcite .",
    "especially , when taking into account the two - flavor color superconductivity , the vector interaction combined with the charge - neutrality constraint and/or the axial anomaly can even lead to multiple chiral critical points @xcite .",
    "we observe from fig.[fig:5 ] that the attractive axial - vector interaction at finite @xmath6 has a similar influence on the chiral phase transition as the vector interaction does at finite @xmath98 .",
    "however , in the instanton molecule model , the axial - vector interaction at finite @xmath6 and the vector interaction at finite @xmath98 have opposite effects on the chiral transition . since the induced @xmath49 and @xmath50 have different signs , the chiral transition will be strengthened ( softened ) at finite @xmath6 ( @xmath98 ) . in addition ,",
    "the influence of the axial - vector interaction on the chiral transition at finite @xmath6 could be more remarkable since the coupling @xmath49 is much stronger than @xmath50 in the instanton molecule picture .",
    "locating the cp on the @xmath154 phase diagram is a focus of the current studies on the qcd phase transition and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "so far , the location and even the existence of the cp is still under debate .",
    "since there is no sign problem at finite @xmath6 , it is very interesting to explore the @xmath0 phase diagram of the chirally imbalanced matter and locate the tcp by means of the lattice simulation .",
    "such an investigation may provide useful information on the true qcd phase transition .",
    "moreover , studying the @xmath0 phase diagram through lattice qcd may shed light on the non - perturbative features of sqgp .",
    "for example , we can test the instanton molecule picture of qcd by investigating the @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "in this article , we have first investigated the influence of the axial - vector interaction on the chiral magnetic effect by introducing an axial chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "such an interaction can be induced by the instanton molecules or derived from the one gluon exchange approximation of qcd . in the presence of a finite chirality density @xmath58 , a dynamical axial chemical potential @xmath99",
    "is generated through the density - density correlation .",
    "we derived that the induced electric current density @xmath24 in an external magnetic field @xmath9 linearly depends on the effective axial chemical potential @xmath74 which including the contribution of @xmath99 .",
    "accordingly , the obtained @xmath24 deviates from the standard analytical formula and explicitly depends on the chirality density @xmath58 . in general",
    ", the deviation relies on the axial - vector coupling @xmath49 , the axial chemical potential @xmath6 , the temperature @xmath100 , and the magnetic field @xmath132 .    for @xmath115 from the one gluon exchange approximation",
    ", the induced current density can be significantly suppressed comparing with the analytical value .",
    "we also find that the ratio @xmath155 is insensitive to the axial chemical potential and the magnetic field but decreases with increasing temperature if @xmath115 .",
    "these features are quite consistent with the recent lattice results at finite @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the suppression of the lattice data comparing with the analytical formula can be attributed to the influence of the attractive axial - vector interaction of qcd . actually , it is very likely that the deviation of the lattice result originates from the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that nielsen - ninomiya s argument does not support the renormalization of cme if @xmath6 is not shifted dynamically .    on the contrary , an unconventional prediction from the instanton molecule model",
    "is that the axial - vector interaction is repulsive with @xmath114 and much stronger than the vector interaction . as a consequence",
    ", the chiral magnetic effect will be enhanced significantly by the instanton molecules near @xmath21 .",
    "in such a picture , the ratio @xmath156 increases with both @xmath6 and @xmath100 .",
    "these features deviate obviously from the current lattice results .",
    "since the present lattice simulation at finite @xmath6 is still rough and sensitive to the lattice spacing , we anticipate the more improved lattice calculation to test these predictions .",
    "in addition , we also demonstrated that the axial - vector interaction plays an important role on the @xmath0 phase diagram of the chirally imbalanced matter .",
    "the repulsive ( attractive ) axial - vector interaction can effectively strengthen ( weaken ) the chiral phase transition if the coupling is relatively strong .",
    "the chiral tcp on the @xmath0 plane is shifted towards the lower ( higher ) @xmath6 region by the repulsive ( attractive ) axial - vector coupling .",
    "this is quite different from ( similar to ) the role of the vector interaction on the chiral phase transition at finite baryon chemical potential @xmath98 .",
    "since there is no sign problem at finite @xmath6 , the improved lattice simulation is still very welcome for disclosing the non - perturbative qcd effect on the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "moreover , studying the deviation of the induced current density from the analytic result and locating the tcp in @xmath0 plane by the lattice simulation can be used to test the instanton molecule picture for @xmath18 .",
    "we note that if @xmath6 is introduced by coupling it only to the chiral density , it ca nt be considered as a true chemical potential .",
    "the reason is that the axial charge is not a conserved quantity due to the axial anomaly .",
    "recently , it is proposed by robakov @xcite that @xmath6 should be conjugated to a proper combination of the chiral density and a chern - simon term , which is a conserved quantity .",
    "it is then claimed in @xcite that the fact @xmath6 must be associated with a conserved charge is essential in the discussion for the nonrenormalization of the cme current .",
    "since there exists a subtlety on the definition of @xmath6 , a question naturally arises that whether the dynamical axial chemical potential @xmath157 defined in this paper can be associated with a conserved charge .",
    "we point out that @xmath157 does nt need to be conjugated to a conserved charge if @xmath6 could be really well - defined .",
    "the reason is that @xmath157 is an induced quantity generated dynamically by the axial - vector interaction for nonzero @xmath58 .",
    "this is different from the parameter @xmath6 ( assuming it has been well - defined as a true chemical potential ) , which should be associated with a conserved charge in principle .",
    "we note that no matter how @xmath6 is introduced , it must give rise to nonzero @xmath58 .",
    "as demonstrated in this paper , the @xmath157 induced by @xmath58 will modify the chiral imbalance described originally by @xmath6 .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to investigate the role of the axial - vector interaction at finite @xmath98 in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "conjugate to the induced current for the chiral magnetic effect at finite @xmath6 , an axial - vector current along the direction of the external magnetic field is generated at finite @xmath98@xcite .",
    "another related topic at finite @xmath98  is the so called chiral shift parameter@xcite in a magnetic field .",
    "the roles of the axial - vector interaction in these cases will be reported elsewhere@xcite .",
