    "studying quarkonium production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is useful for verifying the existence of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the collision and understanding its properties as first suggested by matsui and satz  @xcite .",
    "studies based on various theoretical models  @xcite have shown that the suppressed production of quarkonia observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions at sps , rhic , and lhc  @xcite is mainly due to their dissociation by the thermal partons in the produced quark - gluon plasma , particularly when its temperature is high  @xcite .",
    "although these studies all give reasonable descriptions of the experimental data , various assumptions and model parameters were introduced .",
    "one of these is the time for quarkonia production from initial hard nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "this time is relevant for determining the survival probability of a quarkonium in the hot dense matter as the heavy quark pair before forming the quarkonium is not likely to be dissociated in a medium either due to the color screening effect or by scattering with the thermal partons as shown in a recent study by one of the authors based on the color evaporation model  @xcite .",
    "the survivability of a quarkonium is thus low if its formation time is short , as it is produced in the hot dense matter , and high if its formation time is long , as it is more likely to be formed outside the matter . for quarkonium production from a nucleon - nucleon collision in vacuum , its formation time",
    "is known to be not short compared to the time for the production of a heavy quark pair  @xcite .",
    "the quarkonium formation time in heavy ion collisions is , however , not well determined . in some studies",
    "it is taken to be its value in the vacuum , while in other studies it is assumed to be the same as the thermalization time used in the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "it has also been treated simply as a parameter in some studies .    using the space - time correlator of heavy quark vector currents and the heavy quark potentials extracted from the lattice",
    "qcd , we have shown in a recent study that the presence of a qgp makes the quarkonium formation time longer , and this effect becomes stronger with increasing temperature of the qgp  @xcite .",
    "this study is , however , carried out for a constant qgp temperature , thus neglecting the effect due to the rapid decrease in temperature . in the present study",
    ", we extend our previous calculations to include this effect by using the time - dependent qgp temperature obtained from a hydrodynamic model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formulas ] , we briefly review the quarkonium formation time in the vacuum and in a qgp .",
    "we then describe in sec .",
    "[ results ] the quarkonium formation time in a hydrodynamic background for relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "by using the dispersion relation , the space - time correlator of the heavy quark vector current operator can be decomposed into the propagators of physical states as  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the relativistic causal propagator in the coordinate space with @xmath5 being the modified bessel function and @xmath6 being the euclidean proper time  @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "the factor @xmath7 should be multiplied to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) , but its effect is negligible for the present study  @xcite .",
    "each propagator is weighted by the imaginary part im@xmath8 of the heavy quark polarization function , which has contributions from both resonances and the continuum states : @xmath9 in the above , @xmath10 is the electric charge of a heavy quark in units of @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the coordinate space wavefunction of the resonance at the origin ; and @xmath13 is the threshold energy for the continuum states . the mass distributions of resonances are taken to have the breit - wigner form with a peak at @xmath14 and the width @xmath15 , and the continuum states are described by a step function for simplicity .    substituting eq .",

    "( [ correlator ] ) leads to following contributions from resonances and continuum states to the heavy quark space - time correlator : @xmath16 these expressions show that the contribution from the continuum states dominates at early times and is gradually taken over by that from resonances  @xcite .",
    "the formation time of the ground state is defined as the time when its contribution dominates over all other states .",
    "although @xmath6 is the euclidean time , the above definition leads to the same formation time or length of a quarkonium as in other approaches  @xcite .    to calculate the formation time",
    ", we first consider the fraction of the ground state in the correlation function , @xmath17 , and then differentiate it with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath19 indicates how rapidly the ground state becomes dominant in the correlation function .",
    "the formation time is then defined by the expectation value @xmath20    for the formation times of excited states , the contributions from lower - energy states are first subtracted from the correlation function . the fraction of the first excited state , for example , is given by @xmath21 such that the contribution from the first excited state , @xmath22 , eventually dominates  @xcite .    according to eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) , the quarkonium formation time is determined by the three parameters , @xmath14 , @xmath23 , and @xmath13 . for charmonium formation in vacuum , its mass is known and the threshold energy can be taken to be twice the d meson or b meson mass .",
    "the quarkonium wavefunction at the origin is related to the dielectron decay width of the quarknoium by @xmath24 using the values determined from the experimental data on @xmath25 for these parameters , the formation times of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( 1s ) in the vacuum are 0.44 and 0.32 fm/@xmath26 , respectively  @xcite .    for quarkonium formation in a qgp , the values of @xmath14 , @xmath23 , and @xmath13 can be determined from solving the schrdinger equation : @xmath27\\psi_i(r , t)=m_i\\psi_i(r , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the heavy quark potential @xmath28 and heavy quark mass @xmath29 in the qgp . according to our recent study based on the qcd sum rules  @xcite ,",
    "the free energy potential from lattice calculations is the appropriate heavy - quark potential for quarkonium at finite temperature if the quark mass is taken to be its vacuum value . taking the continuum threshold energy to be @xmath30 , i.e. , the energy of the heavy quark pair when they are infinitely apart",
    ", we have evaluated the values of @xmath14 , @xmath23 , and @xmath13 as functions of the qgp temperature .",
    "figure [ qgp ] shows the formation times of charmonia and bottomonia in a qgp as functions of its temperature  @xcite .",
    "we can see that they are longer than their values in vacuum and increase with temperature .",
    "these results are consistent with the picture that it takes a longer time for the heavy quark pair to form a quarkoium when its radius becomes larger with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "the above study can be extended to relativistic heavy - ion collisions by taking into account the change of the temperature of the qgp as the quarkonium forms from the heavy quark pair .",
    "this is achieved by using the 2 + 1 ideal hydrodynamic model , assuming the boost invariance and a zero viscosity for the qgp , which we have previously used in studying quarkonia production in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we assume that for heavy ion collisions at the top energy of rhic , hydrodynamics is applicable after an initial thermalization time of about 0.6 fm/@xmath26  @xcite . to apply the method described in the previous section to the formation of quarkonia in the nonequilibrium matter before the thermalzation time",
    ", we assume for simplicity that the modification of the quarkonium formation time is independent of the momentum anisotropy of the matter  @xcite and is determined by an effective temperature that is related to the entropy density of the matter through the lattice equation of state  @xcite that is used in our hydrodynamic model . further assuming that the initial nonequilibrium matter expands only in the longitudinal direction , which is supported by studies based on the color glass condensate picture in which the pre - equilibrium state in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is composed of color electromagnetic fields  @xcite , the entropy density is then inversely proportional to time .",

    "since the dissociation temperature of @xmath1 is much lower than that of @xmath0(1s ) , it appears later at both centralities . with the lattice free energy as the heavy quark potential , the dissociation temperatures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are about 1.14 and 0.94 @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the time for this to happen is 5.6 fm/@xmath26 for @xmath1 and 10.4 fm/@xmath26 for @xmath2 in collisions at the 0 - 5 % centrality and is 2.0 fm/@xmath26 for @xmath1 and 4.4 fm/@xmath26 for @xmath2 in collisions at the 50 - 60 centrality .",

    "although the initial energy density in heavy - ion collisions is so high that the heavy quark and antiquark pair produced in a hard collision are screened from each other , there is still a possibility for them to form a bound state if the duration of the high density stage is short , because they are initially very close to each other in space . however ,",
    "if the duration of high energy density is long , it is then unlikely that the initial heavy quark and antiquark pair can form a quarkonium as they are far apart at the formation time , such as for the excited states of bottomonia and all charmonia in central collisions as well as the excited states of both bottomonia and charmonia in semi - central collisions . in this case",

    "the dissociation width @xmath45 of the formed quarkonium at time @xmath6 in the above equation depends on the temperature of the quark - gluon plasma at that time and its dissociation cross section by thermal partons . for the latter",

    "the formation time of quarkonium is one of essential ingredients used in studies on quarkonium production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . to calculate the formation time in the quark - gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "we have extended the method which uses the space - time correlator for the heavy quark vector current and its dispersion relation to the case that the produced quark - gluon plasma is described by a 2 + 1 ideal hydrodynamic model . before the initial thermalization time where hydrodynamics is not applicable , we have assumed that the hot dense matter expands only in the longitudinal direction and its effect on quarkonium formation can be described by an effective temperature .",
    "we have found that the quarkonium states begin to appear as the hot dense matter expands and cools to their dissociation temperatures , and the times to complete their formations in central au+au collisions at the top energy of rhic are at 1.2 , 6.6 , 8.8 , 5.8 , and 11.0 fm / c for @xmath0(1s ) , @xmath0(2s ) , @xmath0(3s ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . in semi - central or peripheral collisions , both the start time of the formation and the formation time of a quarkonium are shorter than in central collisions .",
    "the increased formation time of quarkonia in the hot dense matter is expected to affect their survivability in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we have found , for example , that including the formation time increases appreciably the survivability of @xmath0(1s ) .",
    "this effect depends , however , on the magnitude and temperature dependence of the thermal decay width of a quarkonium , with a strong temperature dependence giving a larger effect and a weak temperature dependence giving a small effect .",
    "unfortunately , both the magnitude and temperature dependence of the quarkonium thermal decay widths are presently not well determined as very different values have been used in the phenomenological studies of qaurkonium production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally , since the formation time of @xmath47 in relativistic heavy ion collisions is not much longer than the initial thermalization time , a better treatment of the effect of the initial nonequilibrium matter than that used in the present study is needed .",
