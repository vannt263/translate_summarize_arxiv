    "beppo - sax observations ( heise 1997 ) of fading x - ray emission have resulted in the first identified radio and optical counterparts to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "five grbs have been localized with the wide field camera of the beppo - sax experiment to within 3 arc minutes ( one during the science verification phase ) , with 3 showing x - ray afterglows .",
    "optical counterparts have been identified for grb 970228 and grb  970508 , with a flaring radio counterpart identified with the latter grb ( frail et al .",
    "detection of optical fe  ii and mg  ii absorption lines in the spectrum of the optical counterpart to grb  970508  ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) demonstrates that at least one grb is at cosmological distances with @xmath0 .",
    "even though grb  970111 was the most intense of the five beppo - sax bursts , an x - ray afterglow was not detected from it .",
    "this indicates that very different behaviors should be expected from different grbs .",
    "the high energy emission from grbs is almost certainly radiated by non - thermal particles as evidenced by their rapid variabilty and broken power - law spectral shapes ( e.g. , fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "the spectra of the afterglows also indicate a non - thermal origin .",
    "the spectrum of the grb  970228 afterglow has a flux density @xmath1 extending from the optical to the x - rays ( katz , piran & sari 1997 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the grb  970508  afterglow measured at may 10.178 ut ( 30.6 hours after the initial burst at may  8.904  ut ) is also a power - law with energy index @xmath2 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "furthermore , the optical / x - ray spectral index found by interpolating the r - band fluxes at the time of the beppo - sax nfi x - ray observation at may  9.1375  ut is consistent with this value .",
    "the radio spectrum of grb  970508  measured on may  13.96 ut rises from 1.43 to 8.46  ghz with index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ; frail et al .",
    "1997 ) which suggests a self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum with self - absorption frequency near 10  ghz . taken together ,",
    "these data argue in favor of a nonthermal synchrotron process for the afterglow emission .",
    "the inferred isotropic total energy of grb  970508  at @xmath5 is @xmath6 ergs ( e.g. , waxman 1997 ) , which exceeds the energy available through @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath9 processes in neutron - star coalescence events ( ruffert et al .",
    "1997 ) by @xmath10 orders of magnitude .",
    "blast - wave scenarios involving the impulsive release of energy into a thin , spherically expanding shell also encounter difficulties in explaining the complex time profiles of grbs under the assumption of local spherical symmetry for the blast wave ( fenimore , madras & nayakshin 1996 ) .",
    "relativistic outflows consisting of discrete emitting components relieve the energetics problems and may also ameliorate the difficulties in explaining grb light curves .    in this _",
    ", we consider a model for grb afterglows where the emission is produced by nonthermal electrons entrained in collimated , highly relativistic magnetized plasmoids .",
    "the initial flaring of the emission at frequencies greater than the self - absorbtion frequency is due to the opening angle of the beaming cone intercepting the line - of - sight as the plasmoid slows down . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the light curve is also affected by the evolution of the self - absorption frequency .",
    "subsequent fading of the emission results from bulk deceleration of the plasmoid and the corresponding decrease of the doppler factor with time .",
    "we provide model fits to the optical light curve of grb  970508  which bracket the delayed radio emission and which are in accord with the measured x - ray emission . if the model parameters used to fit grb  970508  are representative of a substantial fraction of grbs , then implications for the number of grb sources and the nature of the grb emission mechanism follow .",
    "for simplicity we approximate the geometry of the emitting plasma as a single , homogeneous sphere , although the afterglow emitting region could have a more complex geometry or be composed of many separate emission elements moving with a range of speeds .",
    "let @xmath11 be the initial comoving radius of the plasmoid at time @xmath12 as measured in the frame of the burst explosion .",
    "if most of the energy content of the plasmoid is contained in a nonrelativistic thermal component and the plasmoid expands adiabatically with thermal speed @xmath13 , then @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the time measured in the comoving frame of the plasmoid .",
    "conservation of momentum for the plasmoid in the limit of negligible internal energy loss due to radiation ( katz 1994 ; see katz and piran 1997 for the opposite limit ) implies that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total mass at location @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the mass density of ambient gas , and @xmath20=\\pi r^2(t)$ ] is the cross - sectional area of the plasmoid . here",
    "@xmath21 is the bulk lorentz factor of the plasmoid at @xmath18 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the relation between the time elements in the comoving and explosion frame is just @xmath23 .",
    "these expressions are solved iteratively to determine the speed of the plasmoid as a function of time .",
    "we assume that nonthermal electrons are described in the comoving frame by an isotropic angular distribution and a power - law shock - acceleration spectrum given by @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the injection electron lorentz factor .",
    "these electrons lose energy by adiabatic and synchrotron processes . the adiabatic energy - loss rate for relativistic electrons is given by @xmath27 .",
    "when such losses dominate , @xmath28 = n_0\\gamma^{-p } [ { r(t)\\over r_0}]^{1-p},\\qquad        1 \\leq \\gamma \\leq \\gamma_{\\rm max } { r_0\\over r(t)},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 is the energy injected into the nonthermal electrons .",

    "the angle between the beaming axis and the observer is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fine structure constant , @xmath42 is the classical electron radius , and @xmath43 is a combination of @xmath44-functions given by blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) . the self - absorption frequency is @xmath45^{2/(p+4)}.\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is another combination of @xmath44-functions and @xmath47 is the optical depth to synchrotron self - absorption through the center of the plasmoid at the self - absorption frequency ; both these functions are described and tabulated by gould ( 1979 ) . above and below the self - absorption frequency , the observed spectrum can be well - described by a broken power - law : @xmath48 where the normalization @xmath49 is given by equation  [ thin_synchrotron ] .",
    "we also calculate the synchrotron self - compton component ( see dermer , sturner , & schlickeiser 1997 ) and find that it makes negligible contribution to the radio through x - ray emission of the grb  970508  afterglow .",
    "the optical afterglow light curve of grb  970508  was found to rise following the burst event ; it then peaked after @xmath50  days , and thereafter decayed with an approximate @xmath51 dependence similar to the decay law of the grb  970228 optical afterglow .",
    "the most extensive set of flux measurements for grb  970508  are in the r - band , for which precise photometric estimates have been made for a subset of these observations ( djorgovski et al .",
    "the r - band data is shown in figure  1a along with our approximate fits for two sets of burst and plasmoid parameters .    in the context of our decelerating plasmoid model",
    ", the shape of the afterglow light curve can be understood analytically by considering the simpler case where the ambient density and plasmoid cross - sectional area are constants .",
    "the peak in the optical light curve occurs when the bulk lorentz factor has decreased to a value of @xmath52 .",
    "note that if the observing angle @xmath53 , then there will be no initial rise in the light curve of the non - self - absorbed emission as observed for the initial optical afterglow of grb  970228 .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 of the peak flux and the flux at early time is proportional to @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "equation  [ thin_synchrotron ] ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the doppler factors at the time of the peak flux and immediately following the burst , respectively . for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the doppler factor is @xmath60 so that the ratio of peak to intial doppler factor is @xmath61 . using this result and the flux ratio found from the r - band light curve , @xmath62 , we solve for @xmath63 and find @xmath64 .",
    "the time delay of the peak , @xmath65 , constrains the cross - sectional area @xmath66 of the plasmoid and the density of the ambient medium . from momentum balance",
    ", we have @xmath67 .",
    "this gives @xmath68 where we have used the approximation @xmath69 .",
    "the expansion of the plasmoid has the effect of increasing the required value of @xmath63 and reducing the required initial cross - sectional area of the plasmoid relative to the non - expanding case .",
    "all non - self - absorbed emission below the high - energy cutoffs should rise and fall with the same characteristic behavior in this model .",
    "in producing the fits shown in figure  1a , we have fixed the total plasmoid energy @xmath70  ergs ( which is dominated by the kinetic energy of the thermal plasma , i.e. , @xmath71 ) , set @xmath72 in accord with the measured optical spectral index of @xmath73 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) , and considered bulk initial lorentz factors for the plasmoid in the range @xmath74@xmath75 .",
    "we have also considered initial thermal expansion velocities in the range @xmath76@xmath77  cm  s@xmath78 and ambient densities of @xmath79@xmath80  @xmath81 .",
    "the initial energy of nonthermal electrons is determined by an injection efficiency defined by @xmath82 .",
    "the complete set of parameters for the two fits is given in table  1 .",
    "we note that the magnetic field strengths of the plasmoid in both cases are well below the equipartition values , which ensures that the self - absorption frequency is not too high .",
    "furthermore , we find that these relatively low values for the magnetic field are also consistent with our assumption that the electron spectrum evolves mainly through adiabatic cooling , since synchrotron cooling is only important at frequencies @xmath83    just below the self - absorption frequency , expansion of the plasmoid plays an important role in detemining the location of the peak of the light curve . for the afterglow of grb  970508 , the peak of the radio emission is delayed by a few days relative to the peak of the optical light curve , and",
    "this is consistent with the inference that the self - absorption frequency is in this range .",
    "as the plasmoid expands , it becomes non - self - absorbed at increasingly lower frequencies .",
    "this produces an additional enhancement in the observed flux at these frequencies superposed on the flaring of the emission due to the deceleration of the plasmoid , which also causes the observed self - absorption frequency to decrease with time . the 8.48.46  ghz radio data ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) shown in figure  1b is bracketed by our model results which fit the optical light curve in figure  1a .",
    "the parameters in table  1 cover a wide range of values and have not been fine - tuned to fit the radio data precisely .",
    "however , the model fits pass through the x - ray data point ( piro et al .",
    "1997 ) shown in figure  1c without any additional adjustment .",
    "our model predicts that the x - ray and optical light curves would rise and fall together , except that the x - ray flux can also decline as a result of synchrotron cooling ( cf .",
    "[ [ synch_cooling_frequencies ] ] ) or , depending on the initial value of @xmath84 , through either adiabatic or synchrotron losses .",
    "we have proposed a model for grb afterglows where nonthermal electrons emit synchrotron radiation in relativistic bulk plasma outflows .",
    "other models for grb afterglows also consider synchrotron processes ( e.g. , wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ; waxman 1997 ; katz & piran 1997 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "1997 ; tavani 1997 ) , but these studies treat a blast wave scenario , whereas we consider highly collimated outflows .",
    "this significantly reduces the energetics requirements and the need for the emitting region to be radiatively efficient .",
    "indeed , we do not find that the radiating plasmoid in our model for grb  970508slows to nonrelativistic speeds .",
    "the small beaming angles and large lorentz factors derived here have important implications for grb models under the assumption that the prompt gamma - ray emission from a typical grb has a beaming angle @xmath85 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because there is no evidence from grb light curves for spreading of the pulse widths during the main portion of the burst , which would be expected if the emitting plasma was significantly decelerating during the gamma - ray active phase .",
    "we find that the inferred total gamma - ray energy for grb  970508  is reduced by a factor @xmath86 from the isotropic value if the gamma - ray beaming pattern is @xmath87 , noting also that the gamma - ray emission is being viewed at an angle @xmath88 from the beaming axis .",
    "furthermore , because the gamma - rays are beamed into a fraction @xmath89 of the full sky , a much larger source rate than the isotropic rate is required .",
    "this rate is too large to be accounted for by the rate of coalescing compact objects ( see review by dermer & weiler 1995 ) .",
    "if this model is correct , it therefore favors other grb senarios such as naked collapse events of white dwarfs ( dar et al .",
    "1992 ) , birth events of highly magnetized neutron stars ( usov 1992 ) , or failed type 1b supernova models ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "the large lorentz factor found for the radio , optical and x - ray observations of grb  970508  does not follow the power - law scaling ( paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; mszros & rees 1997 ) of the lorentz factor with frequency invoked by rhoads ( 1997 ) to estimate the optical transient detection rate .",
    "it also contradicts the inference by rhoads ( 1997 ) that the material which produces the afterglow emission is only mildly relativistic , and thus removes a central motivation for the hypernova model of paczyski ( 1997 ) insofar as highly collimated burst emission models are not ruled out .",
    "if grb  970508  is typical of a large fraction of grbs and if the gamma - ray beaming pattern is indeed governed by the doppler factor @xmath57 at early times , then we can make definite predictions for the likelihood of detecting optical afterglow emission from such bursts .",
    "figure  2 shows the afterglow light curves for our two sets of model parameters at different observing angles . for grbs viewed at smaller angles than the inferred observing angle for grb  970508 the afterglow optical flux",
    "is greatly enhanced , though the probability of detecting these bright afterglows is correspondingly smaller .",
    "for example , we find that the peak optical afterglow emission from one out of every @xmath90 grbs will reach r @xmath91 , given that the peak r - band magnitude of grb  970508  was 19.6 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "optical transients not associated with grbs ( i.e. , when @xmath92 ) reach a much fainter peak magnitude .",
    "this effect is important for optical transient detection estimates and implies much lower rates than estimated by rhoads ( 1997 ) .",
    "as noted previously , the afterglow light curve ( for the non - self - absorbed emission ) should fall monotonically for observing angles @xmath93 .",
    "this can explain the optical afterglow light curve of grb  920228 which appears to decline monotonically .",
    "the plasmoid producing the grb  970508  optical afterglow between 3 and 10 days after the burst travels 30100 pc .",
    "if it enters a lower density medium over this distance , its optical flux will decline much more slowly and could account for the discrepancy between the model fit and data shown in figure  1a .",
    "this effect might also explain the flattening of the grb  970228 r - band light curve after @xmath94 week ( galama et al . 1997a ) .",
    "the burst afterglow model considered here is similar to nonthermal synchrotron models for the radio - through - optical continua of blazars , though with larger lorentz factors .",
    "hence , we expect that certain blazar characteristics should also be seen in grb afterglows , such as superluminal motion and high polarization .",
    "in particular , we predict that radio and optical superluminal motion should be measured . from the parameters used to fit grb  970508 we expect a motion of @xmath95 milliarcseconds per month .",
    "detection of superluminal motion of this magnitude in afterglow emissions of grbs would require highly relativistic emission regions , in accord with the model proposed here .",
