    "in genomic data analyses , genome scans for detecting loci that have some particular and interesting functions are often undertaken . these procedures are regarded as repeated statistical testings , and hence they are formalized as multiple testing procedures . in such multiple testings ,",
    "one crucial point is how to adjust the multiplicity of tests .",
    "this is because the method of adjustment seriously affects the interpretation of the data analysis .",
    "the detection of the interactive loci pairs assumed to exist in the bateson - dobzhansky - muller ( bdm ) model , which motivates our study , is such a genome scan problem . in biological concept ,",
    "`` species '' are defined as `` groups of interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups '' ( @xcite ) . the genetic mechanism for separating species",
    "is called reproductive isolation , which is observed as hybrid sterility or hybrid inviability between particular groups .",
    "the bdm model is a model for explaining evolution of genetic incompatibility genes .",
    "more precisely , the bdm model assumes that there exist pairs of loci such that when the loci have particular genotypes , sterility or inviability occurs and hence a descendant is not produced ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , we refer to the interactive loci pair as the bdm pair .",
    "the importance of studying such interactive pair loci is widely acknowledged .",
    "however , few studies have succeeded in identifying such pairs and in revealing the mechanism behind them . for the detection of bdm pairs ,",
    "choosing two groups used for crossing is crucial but difficult .",
    "if parents are genetically separate , then descendants can not be produced .",
    "conversely , if parents are too close , then sterility or inviability can not be observed .",
    "the detection of a bdm pair of _ arabidopsis _ intra - species by @xcite , and the detection of a bdm pair of rice inter - subspecies by @xcite are exceptionally successful studies .",
    "the original purpose of this paper is to give an answer to a statistical problem that @xcite have faced in the course of their studies .",
    "figure [ fig : contour - f2 ] is the contour plot depicting scan statistics for detecting bdm pairs in a 2nd filial generation ( @xmath1 ) population from two rice subspecies used by @xcite .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes represent loci positions in 12 chromosomes of rice .",
    "each scan statistic is a chi - square statistic with 4 degrees of freedom , and the number of statistics is around 500,000 . because of the large number of tests , some adjustment for the multiplicity of tests is necessary .",
    "the bonferroni adjustments are frequently used in multiple testing . however ,",
    "in our case where the statistics are highly correlated with each other , the bonferroni adjustment that is calculated without information of correlation would lead to very conservative results .",
    "the multiplicity - adjusted @xmath0-value for correlated scan statistics is defined from the distribution of their maximum . for calculating this distribution ,",
    "we require knowledge of the correlation structure or joint distribution .",
    "this structure can be determined from experimental design in the case of crossing experiments such as the detection problem of bdm pairs .",
    "in particular , when the number of statistics is large and when the correlation structure is systematic , we can consider a large number of scan statistics as a random field and can obtain the distribution of the maximum .",
    "the distribution of the maximum of a random field ( process ) has been extensively studied . in this paper ,",
    "the approaches we use are nonlinear renewal theory and the volume - of - tube method ( tube method ) .",
    "the nonlinear renewal theory we use was developed by @xcite and @xcite . in this method , a random field is locally treated as a random walk , and the distribution of its maximum is obtained by using sequential analysis .",
    "the volume - of - tube method is an integral - geometric approach for approximating the distribution of the maximum of a gaussian random field through evaluating the volume of the index set ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , this is equivalent to applying the euler characteristic heuristic to a gaussian field ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ subsec : scan ] , we explain the scan statistics for detecting bdm pairs . under the null hypothesis that a bdm pair does not exist , we see that the joint distribution of the scan statistics is regarded asymptotically as a chi - square random field with a direct - product covariance structure restricted on a lattice point index set .",
    "we also discuss other statistical problems that have the same stochastic structure as the detection of bdm pairs in section [ subsec : other ] . in section",
    "[ sec : maximum ] , we formalize this chi - square random field in a general setting , and provide approximate formulas for its maximum distribution by using nonlinear renewal theory and the volume - of - tube method .",
    "renewal theory assumes that the lattice points are equally spaced .",
    "this assumption may be unreasonable , because it implies that marker spacings are uniform .",
    "hence , we use numerical comparisons to examine the difference between the randomly spaced case and the equally spaced case . the volume - of - tube method yields asymptotically conservative bounds by embedding the random field defined on a discrete set ( i.e. , unequally spaced lattice points ) into a random field that has a continuous and piecewise smooth sample path . in section",
    "[ sec : detection ] , we analyze the data of @xcite .",
    "they first screened the candidates of loci by analyzing datasets from two @xmath1 populations and reciprocal backcross ( bc ) populations , and finally succeeded in isolating causal genes of a bdm pair by positional cloning .",
    "we examine their data , and confirm that their genetic finding about the bdm pair is significant from the viewpoint of multiple testing procedures .",
    "the proofs of proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] , which describes the asymptotic correlation structure of the chi - square statistics for detecting interactive pairs , and the tail probability formulas in theorems [ thm : renewal ] and [ thm : tube ] are given in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "in this subsection , we explain the scan statistic for detecting bdm pairs and its asymptotic joint distribution for the case of the @xmath1 population dealt with by @xcite .",
    "we focus on the number of @xmath1 individuals that avoided such a fatal event and grew up .",
    "each locus of an individual in the @xmath1 population produced by two strains a and b has the genotypes aa , bb , and ab . abbreviating them to a , b , and h , respectively ,",
    "the genotypes of loci 1 and 2 are cross - classified in table [ tab : crosstable ] .",
    "c|ccc locus 1 @xmath2 locus 2 & a & b & h + a & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath5 + b & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 + h & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 +    if this table shows some discrepancy against the independence of rows and columns , then the lack of individuals ( sterility ) is assumed to have happened when the loci pair has particular genotypes .",
    "noting this , @xcite used the chi - square statistics for independence ( pearson s chi - square statistics ) as scan statistics for detection .",
    "similar scan statistics are used by @xcite in an @xmath12 spore population from an inter - species cross of yeast .",
    "let @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) be the chi - square statistic calculated from the pair of the marker @xmath15 on chromosome @xmath16 and the marker @xmath17 on chromosome @xmath18 .",
    "the multiplicity - adjusted @xmath0-value can be obtained from the upper probability of the maximum of all chi - square statistics @xmath19 under the null hypothesis @xmath20 that a bdm pair does not exist .",
    "the distribution of each statistic @xmath13 is approximated as the chi - square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom when the number @xmath21 of individuals is large .",
    "however , these statistics are not independent and are highly correlated because of the linkage . under the assumption of haldane s model ( see , e.g. , @xcite , section 5.6 ) , which is the most standard model for linkage , the joint distribution under the null hypothesis @xmath20 is described in proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] below .",
    "the proof is given in section [ subsec : proof - corr ] .    [ prop : chi - square - field ] ( a ) let @xmath22 ( m : morgan ) be locations of markers @xmath23 on a chromosome ( chromosome @xmath24 , say ) .",
    "let @xmath25 be locations of markers @xmath26 on another chromosome ( chromosome @xmath27 , say ) . under the null hypothesis that a bdm pair does not exist , as the total sample size @xmath21 goes to infinity , convergence in distribution",
    "@xmath28 holds jointly for all @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are independent , and for each @xmath31 , the @xmath32 s are distributed according to the multivariate normal distribution with a marginal mean @xmath33 , a variance @xmath24 , and the following covariance structure : @xmath34 with @xmath35    \\(b ) under the null hypothesis that a bdm pair does not exist , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are asymptotically independently distributed unless @xmath38 .",
    "this proposition does not tell us about marker pairs belonging to the same chromosome .",
    "when two markers are located on the same chromosome , the linkage affects the independence of the rows and columns in table [ tab : crosstable ] , and the chi - square statistic simply measures the effect of the linkage directly . because this is irrelevant to the reproductive isolation , we ignore such pairs .",
    "based on the asymptotic distribution given by proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] , we can evaluate the multiplicity - adjusted @xmath0-value ( see ( [ pvalue ] ) ) . in this context ,",
    "calculation of the upper probability of the maximum of a chi - square random field on lattice points is crucial .",
    "the primary theoretical purpose of this paper is to provide approximate formulas for upper tail probability in a more general setting .",
    "the covariance structure in proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] also appears in other scan statistics .",
    "we illustrate two examples briefly .",
    "the first example is the detection of epistasis in quantitative trait loci ( qtl ) analysis . in qtl analysis for @xmath1 population , phenotype @xmath39 and genotypes @xmath40 are observed for each individual , where @xmath41 is the index of markers , and @xmath40 takes the values a , b , and h. the following is a simple model of qtl analysis incorporating the effects of epistasis between a loci pair @xmath29 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath47 ( @xmath46 ) , and @xmath51 is a gaussian measurement error .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 represent the epistasis . for identifying the loci pair @xmath29 ,",
    "the scan statistic @xmath53 defined as the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) statistic for testing the null hypothesis of no epistasis @xmath54 is used .",
    "it is shown that the asymptotic joint distribution of @xmath55 is the same as that of @xmath56 in proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] when @xmath15 and @xmath17 are on different chromosomes , and the multiplicity - adjusted @xmath0-value can be obtained similarly .",
    "the second example is the detection of a change - point in two - way ordered categorical data .",
    "for the cell probability @xmath57 , @xcite assumed a log - linear model with a change - point at @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the indicator function , and define a scan statistic @xmath61 as the lrt statistic for testing @xmath62 . under the null hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath63 is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath64 in proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and multiplicity - adjusted @xmath0-value can be obtained in our framework .",
    "in this section , as a generalization of the random field referred to in proposition [ prop : chi - square - field ] , we define a chi - square random field on a multi - dimensional index set with a direct - product type covariance structure such as ( [ cov - structure ] ) , and consider the distribution of its maximum over a multi - dimensional lattice points .    for @xmath69 ,",
    "let us consider a real - valued continuous gaussian random field on @xmath70 that has the following moment structure : @xmath71=0 , \\quad v[z_k(t)]=1 , \\quad { \\mathrm{cov}}(z_k(t),z_k(t ' ) ) = r_k(t - t'),\\ ] ] where for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a positive constant .",
    "in particular , when @xmath75 , this expression represents the direct - product covariance structure of the stationary ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "@xmath76 are assumed to be independent .",
    "moreover , define @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 is a chi - square random field whose marginal distribution is the chi - square distribution with @xmath80 degrees of freedom .    for @xmath81 ,",
    "let @xmath82 be distinct points , and let @xmath83 .",
    "define a @xmath0-dimensional unequally spaced lattice point set @xmath84 in this section , we provide an approximate formula for the tail probability of the maximum of the chi - square random field @xmath85 restricted on the discrete set @xmath86 : @xmath87      in this subsection , we study large - deviation approximations for the distribution of the maximum ( [ maxchi ] ) in the framework of the nonlinear renewal theory devised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outline of this method is that we first to prove that @xmath88 can be approximated by the maximum of a suitably defined random walk when @xmath85 is large and the spacing of lattice is small .",
    "we then to evaluate the distribution of its maximum with the help of sequential analysis .",
    "a drawback of the method is that the index set @xmath86 must be an equally spaced lattice point set .",
    "that is , for all @xmath89 , the points @xmath90 belonging to @xmath91 are assumed to be equally spaced as @xmath92 if the spaces are not equal , the random walk in the limit does not approach the sum of identical distributions , and hence one can not utilize the reproductivity in the sequential analysis .",
    "however , as we show in section [ subsec : numerical ] , in typical settings for genome analysis , the upper probability for the maximum on unequally spaced lattice points is bounded above by that for the maximum on the equally spaced lattice ( i.e. , the latter gives a conservative bound for the former ) , and the difference between them is not substantial .",
    "define a bounded rectangle in @xmath70 by @xmath93.\\ ] ] for @xmath94 we write @xmath95 .",
    "our problem is to approximate the distribution of the maximum on @xmath0-dimensional lattice points whose spacing in the @xmath89th coordinate is @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97    by using the approach of nonlinear renewal theory , we can obtain the following formula .",
    "the proof is given in section [ subsec : proof - renewal ] .    as @xmath98 , @xmath99 such that @xmath100 , @xmath81 , [ thm : renewal ] @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the volume element of the unit sphere @xmath103 in @xmath104 at @xmath105 , @xmath106 @xmath107 is the lebesgue measure of @xmath108 , and @xmath109 with @xmath110 the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution .",

    "since @xmath116 , ( [ piterbarg ] ) is an asymptotic upper bound for ( [ maxchi ] ) .      in this subsection , we provide a conservative bound for the distribution of the maximum of a chi - square random field ( [ maxchi ] ) by adopting an integral - geometric approach referred to as the volume - of - tube method or the euler characteristic heuristic .",
    "the volume - of - tube method approximates the distribution of the maximum of a gaussian random field that has a continuous and piecewise smooth sample path .",
