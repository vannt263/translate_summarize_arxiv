    "the presence of spacetime singularities in some physically relevant solutions in einstein s gravity is an outstanding and longstanding problem . at the singularity , predictability is lost and standard physics breaks down .",

    "( [ eq - m1 ] ) , einstein s gravity is modified by introducing the auxiliary scalar field @xmath1 ( dilaton ) . in the theory in  ( [ eq - m2 ] ) , @xmath2 is the weyl tensor , @xmath3 is the riemann tensor , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants , and there is no dilaton .",
    "conformal gravity can solve the problem of spacetime singularities present in einstein s gravity as follows ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "if a metric @xmath6 is singular in a gauge , we can always remove its singularities by performing a suitable conformal transformation .",
    "indeed , if a gauge variant quantity ( like a metric tensor ) is singular in a gauge , but not in another gauge , its singularities are not physical , but only an artifact of the gauge .",
    "let us note that there is no fine tuning here , because there is always an infinite class of rescaling factors suitable to remove these singularities .",
    "since the theory is invariant under conformal transformations , we have the freedom to choose the gauge , and the physics will be independent of our choice .    in einstein",
    "s gravity , this is not possible because the theory is not invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "moreover , the world around us is not conformally invariant .",
    "if conformal invariance is a fundamental symmetry of the universe , it must be broken .",
    "in such a case , it is necessary a higgs - like mechanism that breaks the symmetry and selects a certain vacuum .",
    "the selection of the vacuum is determined by the details of the theory and by how conformal symmetry is broken .",
    "the selected vacuum should be one in which the metric is free from singularities , but we do not have currently any selection criterion to decide which vacuum should be chosen among an infinite number of options .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors found singularity - free black hole solutions in conformal gravity .",
    "these spacetimes are geodetically complete because no massless or massive particles can reach the center of the black hole in a finite amount of time or for a finite value of the affine parameter .",
    "moreover , curvature invariants do not diverge at @xmath7 .",
    "while conformal invariance is broken at the quantum level for the theories in  ( [ eq - m1 ] ) and in  ( [ eq - m2 ] )  @xcite , it is preserved in any finite ( i.e. without divergences ) quantum field theory of gravity  @xcite . the latter look thus the natural theoretical framework for conformal symmetry .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the `` energy conditions '' of the singularity - free black hole solutions found in  @xcite . for energy conditions here we mean the energy conditions of the `` effective '' energy - momentum tensor of these solutions assuming the standard einstein s equations . for the theory in  ( [ eq - m1 ] )",
    ", this corresponds to the energy - momentum tensor of the dilaton field @xmath1 .",
    "for the theory in  ( [ eq - m2 ] ) , the actual energy - momentum tensor vanishes , because the singularity - free black hole metrics are vacuum solutions , so we consider an effective energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these energy conditions may be used as a selection criterion to choose the right vacuum in the broken phase by requiring the minimum possible violation .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec - spacetime ] , we briefly review the singularity - free black hole metrics found in refs .  @xcite . in section  [ energy conditions ] , we study the null , the weak , and the strong energy conditions in these black hole spacetimes .",

    "it is natural to expect @xmath13 to be either of the order of the planck scale or of the order of @xmath14 , since there are no other scales in the system .",

    "last , it is worth noting that these solutions are not only stationary exact solutions of conformal gravity theories like those in  ( [ eq - m1 ] ) and in  ( [ eq - m2 ] ) . as in einstein s gravity",

    "if @xmath109 has no zeros , the sec is satisfied everywhere in the spacetime .",

    "while such a selection criterion based on the energy conditions of the effective energy - momentum tensor should be taken with great caution , our conclusion is that nature may prefer a spacetime with a large @xmath35 as the true vacuum .",
