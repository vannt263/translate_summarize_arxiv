    "despite the success in modelling dark matter ( dm ) structure formation on large scales , the clustering properties of dm on galactic scales are fiercely debated .",
    "the number of observed dwarf galaxies around the milky way is lower by many orders of magnitude than the number of _ cold _ dark matter ( cdm ) substructures predicted by cosmological simulations - e.g. @xcite predict a number of cdm substructures with bound mass @xmath12{m_\\odot}$ ] larger by a factor 50 than the number of observed mw satellites in this mass range , and @xcite predict a total of @xmath13 surviving cdm subhaloes down to the mass determined by the free - streaming length ( @xmath14{m_\\odot}$ ] ) . within the cdm paradigm",
    "this can be explained by a suppression of galaxy formation in low - mass dm haloes , through the combined effect of inefficient cooling of gas during hi re - ionization by uv photo heating @xcite and supernova feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leading to dm haloes that do not contain any stars . alternatively dm particle properties , such as low - mass _ warm _ dm ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can lead to a suppression of the small - scale power resulting in a reduction of substructures in galactic halos .",
    "likewise tidal effects due to baryons in the central regions of the host galaxy , such as the presence of a galactic disc , enhance the disruption rate of substructures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thereby alter the amount of surviving substructures .",
    "several methods have been proposed to detect dark substructures through their gravitational interaction with baryons , e.g. surface brightness reconstruction of strong lensing arcs @xcite , the heating of tidal streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the disruption of wide binaries in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies @xcite - these efforts still remain unsuccessful to date .",
    "the inner structure of dm haloes is strongly linked with the number of dm substructures lingering in mw - like galaxies .",
    "the efficiency of tidal stripping inside the host halo depends on the inner density distribution of the satellites .",
    "in particular , dwarf galaxies which have constant - density _ cores _ are less resilient to tidal disruption than dwarf galaxies with centrally - divergent density _ cusps _ @xcite .",
    "while the density profiles of haloes in dm - only simulations are well fit by the cuspy _ nfw _ profile @xcite , contradicting results based on observations of mw satellites have provoked a critical debate on whether dwarf galaxies are cuspy ( @xcite ) , or cored ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , whereas dynamical modelling of local dwarf galaxies argues in favour of a range of cuspy and cored profiles @xcite .",
    "in addition , none of the observed bright mw satellites ( @xmath15{l_\\odot}$ ] ) has an estimated mean density within the stellar half - light radius consistent with the most massive cuspy subhaloes predicted by cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "different processes such as gravitational heating by baryonic clumps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and supernova feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been proposed to remove the density cusp from the centres of dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , recent studies taking into account the effects of tidal stripping on baryonic clumps show significantly milder changes to the central dm density slopes @xcite .",
    "similarly , with supernova feedback , simple analytic energy arguments show that the effect of feedback is relevant only to the brightest dwarfs @xcite , although stochastic star formation in low - mass haloes may help to ease the energetic constraints @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within cdm , erased cusps may still regrow through minor mergers @xcite on the scale of dwarfs .",
    "alternative dm particle models that allow for a large enough cross - section for self - interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a small enough dm particle mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could prevent cusps to form - however @xcite argue that a particle mass small enough to produce core sizes of @xmath16{kpc}$ ] , as measured e.g. for the fornax dwarf galaxy @xcite , is in contradiction to the constraints set by the large scale structure and would prevent the dwarf galaxy to form in the first place . some dm models containing axions",
    "can also be brought to simultaneously solve the missing satellites and cusp / core problems @xcite . in",
    "short , the internal distribution of dm on dwarf scales offers a promising testbed to gather clues on how to constrain a wide range of dm particle models , stellar feedback processes and tidal effects due to the presence of baryons .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the tidal effect of an evolving galactic disc on the survival of dm substructures in milky way - like haloes .",
    "the @xmath0-body experiments of @xcite indicate a depletion of cuspy substructures in presence of a disc , and the more recent study of @xcite is in agreement with these findings by comparing dm - only to full - hydrodynamical simulations of the aq - c-4 main halo .",
    "we are particularly interested in the different dynamical evolution of satellites with respect to their internal dm density profile , that is , how do cuspy vs. cored satellites cope with the joint tidal forces of the dm host halo and a disc , not present in dm - only cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "motivated by the approach of @xcite , we perform controlled simulations of the individual accretion of satellites extracted from the aquarius aq - a-2 merger tree @xcite in an analytical , evolving host halo , where we change single parameters at a time and quantify their effect on the surviving satellite population .",
    "this letter is structured as follows : section [ sec : nummet ] describes our re - simulation technique and the numerical models for the evolving host and satellite galaxies .",
    "we present the results of our controlled simulations in section [ sec : controlledsims ] , and finally discuss our findings and plans for future work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our controlled simulation is based on the merger history of the aquarius a-2 run @xcite .",

    "we compare the orbital decay induced by our semi - analytical model to the orbits of selected satellites in the aq - a-2 simulation , and find that a coulomb - logarithm of @xmath23 reproduces the aquarius results well , consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "models including a disc consist of an additional axisymmetric @xcite profile , with radial and vertical scale lengths @xmath24{kpc}$ ] and @xmath25{kpc}$ ] and mass @xmath26 , where we denote by @xmath27 the virial mass of the nfw halo at redshift @xmath22 . to model dynamical friction in the presence of a disc , for simplicity we require at every radius an isotropic distribution of velocities in a reference frame co - rotating with the disc , with dispersion and rotation velocity as in (",

    "we keep the joint mass of the disc and halo equal to the aq - a-2 halo mass at each redshift .",
    "this choice of adding a disc potential does not alter the distribution of galactocentric distances of the satellite s first pericentric passages .",
    "subsequent pericentric distances are smaller in the models including a disc : orbits decay faster due to the increased dynamical friction inside the disc , and the re - distribution of orbital energy to tidally stripped material becomes more important with the increased mass loss in the models including a disc .",

    "( iii ) we model the disc to have an isotropic velocity dispersion in the co - rotating frame , which leads to lower rotation velocities compared to the mw disc .",
    "consequently the difference in efficiency of dynamical friction on satellites with pro- and retrograde orbits is attenuated .",
    "( iv ) regarding the internal dm distribution of the satellites , in this first contribution we distinguished exemplarily cuspy from cored models with a fixed ratio of dm scale radius @xmath6 and core size @xmath34 , while different dm particle and feedback models motivate many other choices for relative or absolute core sizes @xcite . in a future contribution",
