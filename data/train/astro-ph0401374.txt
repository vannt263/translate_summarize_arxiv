    "there is early work on cepheids in m31 by baade & swope ( 1963 , 1965 ) .",
    "they found and studied @xmath3400 cepheids , primarily for the purpose of estimating the distance modulus for m31 .",
    "a modern day successor to this pioneering work is the direct project ( stanek et al .",
    "1999 ; mochejska et al .",
    "2000 ; bonanos et al .",
    "they have been searching m31 ( and m33 ) for detached eclipsing binaries and cepheids to refine the extragalactic distance ladder .",
    "they analysed five 11@xmath011  fields in m31 and found a total of 410 variables of which roughly half were cepheids .",
    "there is also a substantial body of work on classical novae .",
    "positions , magnitudes and light curves already exist for @xmath3300 classical novae in m31 ( rosino 1973 ; rosino et al .",
    "1989 ; ciardullo , ford & jacoby 1983 ) .",
    "despite all this , the underlying truth of the quotation from hodge s book is evident .",
    "the andromeda galaxy is sufficiently close that the variable star populations can be studied in enormous detail  and with much greater ease than those in our own galaxy , for which an all - sky survey would be needed .",
    "interest in the variable stars of m31 was re - kindled by influential papers by crotts ( 1992 ) and baillon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) on the possible microlensing signal of the halo .",
    "the high inclination of the m31 disk ( @xmath4 ) means that lines of sight to sources in the far disk are longer and pass closer to the denser central parts of the halo than lines of sight to sources in the near disk . in other words",
    ", there is a strong gradient in the microlensing signal across the disk , if the events are caused by objects in a spheroidal halo .",
    "early on , it was argued that the stellar populations of m31 are well - mixed and so no variable star population would show this behaviour ( crotts 1992 ) . thus , it seemed that the strategy in the experiment was straightforward ; first , microlensing candidates should be identified on the basis of achromaticity and goodness of fit to a paczyski curve , and second the gradient of detected candidates should be measured and confronted with theoretical models . the asymmetry in microlensing rate between the near and the far disk therefore seemed an unambiguous way of diagnosing events caused by lenses in the halo , as opposed to stellar lenses , and thus resolving the ambiguity in the results of the experiments monitoring the large magellanic clouds .",
    "accordingly , a number of groups began intensive monitoring of m31 with the aim of detecting microlensing events , including the point - agape ( aurire et al .",

    "2004 ) collaborations .",
    "the first hint that this was not the case came when burgos & wald - doghramadjian ( 2002 ) , working with data taken by the point - agape collaboration , showed that the numbers of variable stars in symmetrically positioned fields in the near and far disk were not equal .",
    "the implication of this finding made the microlensing experiments much more difficult , as the asymmetry in the variable stars needs to be studied and measured as a function of brightness and period .",
    "accordingly , the analysis of the variable star database in the microlensing experiments towards m31 is interesting from the standpoint of the light it throws on stellar populations in m31 and is crucial for a successful conclusion to the microlensing experiments .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the variable star catalogue of the point - agape survey .",
    "this gives the position , period and brightness of 35414 variable stars with high signal - to - noise lightcurves uncovered during the three - year duration of our survey .",
    "the variable star catalogue forms a subset of the grand total of 97280 lightcurves that show variations .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows :   [ sec : data ] describes the acquisition of the data , ",

    "m31 has recently been surveyed by both the xmm - newton and chandra satellites ( osborne et al .",
    "2001 ; kong et al .",
    "2002 ) . in particular , chandra surveyed the inner 17@xmath017  and found 204 discrete x - ray sources .",
    "our wfc fields are separated by a gap of @xmath32 , and so the very centre of m31 is not covered .",
    "this gap is rich in discrete x - ray sources , and so only @xmath3140 of the objects listed in kong et al .",
    "( 2002 ) lie within our wfc fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : alignments ] correlates the variable sources in our catalogue with the discrete x - ray sources . to allow for possible identification with poorly sampled or sporadic optical sources , the primitive version of the catalogue with 97280 lightcurves",
    "the figure shows the cumulative distribution of the separation distances . of course , some accidental alignments are expected . to estimate how serious this problem is , we also show curves of the cumulative distributions with the optical positions shifted by 42 pixels north - east , north - west , south - east and south - west ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "this corresponds to a shift of 30 pixels in each compass direction .",
    "the claimed accuracy of the astrometry in both our and kong et al.s ( 2002 ) catalogue is 1 .",
    "this suggests that objects can be identified if their positions coincide within an error circle of 14 or @xmath35 pixels .",
    "judging from figure  [ fig : alignments ] , the number of accidental alignments is @xmath325 , whereas the actual number of correlations is @xmath340 , which suggests that @xmath16 identifications are physically meaningful .    some of the identifications are due to globular clusters . whilst some of the globular clusters are indeed optically varying , the core of an unresolved globular cluster may also be misreported as a resolved star and this may cause spurious lightcurves in the catalogue . a handful of the identifications may be due to cataclysmic variables and soft x - ray transients .",
    "these are binary systems with a compact degenerate object and a low - mass star .",
    "typically , they are undetectable in quiescence ( @xmath17 ) but brighten dramatically in outbursts ( @xmath18 ) and so may then be present in the survey .",
    "fourteen of the 40 correlations coincide with the positions of semi - regular variables , although for two of these instances , our sampling does not allow us to rule out the possibility of a bursting rather than pulsating star . semi - regular variables are not expected to emit x - rays , unless they are the binary companion to a compact object .",
    "hence , some of these alignments may well correspond to cataclysmic variables .",
    "lightcurves for 6 of these objects are shown in figure  [ fig : xraystars ] .",
    "we note that the lightcurves of r3 - 43 and r3 - 46 ( in the notation of kong et al .",
    "2001 ) have an x - ray outburst @xmath19 days before the optical maximum . a further two objects , r3 - 87 and r3 - 48 , coincide with optical variables showing a linear fall in the first two seasons . one of these is the lightcurve labelled 19755 shown in the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : lcurves5 ] .",

    "we note that another nova ( eq  j004244 + 411757 ) also lies within 13 of the position of an x - ray point source in the same catalogue .",
    "the x - ray counterparts of both novae have been claimed as super - soft x - ray sources by di stefano et al .  ( 2003 ) . a more detailed and homogeneous selection of novae using point - agape",

    "2003 and de jong et al .",
    "2004 ) overplotted on the @xmath20 colour map .",
    "there is a clear asymmetry , as de jong et al .",
    "point out . however , the origin of the asymmetry is difficult to say , as there are no events where the galaxy is dusty and a preponderance of events in the bright spiral arms .",
    "the early papers on microlensing towards m31 made the assumption that variable star populations would show no signs of asymmetry between fields north and south of the major axis .",
    "microlensing , on the other hand , will show a substantial asymmetry if the lensing population resides in a spheroidal halo .",
    "early on , it therefore seemed that an asymmetry in the locations of a sample of microlensing events would be enough to identify the lensing population conclusively with the dark halo of m31 .",
    "the work in this paper has demonstrated that this is not the case .",
    "all the variable star distributions are asymmetric in the sense that the far side ( or south - east ) is brighter or has more detected objects than the near side ( or north - west ) .",
    "this is caused primarily by the effects of variable extinction and the prominent dust lanes associated with the spiral structure .",
    "therefore , the near - far asymmetry signal of microlensing is unfortunately mimicked in the variable star populations , in the underlying surface brightness and in the resolved star catalogue .",
    "this makes an accurate measurement of the asymmetry signal caused by microlensing more difficult .",
    "this paper has measured the size and direction of the asymmetry signal as a function of the period and pseudo - magnitude of the variable stars .",
    "these data form the zero - point of the asymmetry scale . microlensing by a dark halo is a possible explanation if the sample of microlensing candidates of given amplitude and period is more asymmetric than the corresponding variable stars .",
    "theoretical calculations of the expected magnitude of the near - far asymmetry signal from microlensing ( e.g. , kerins et al",
    ".  2001 , 2003 ) assume that the source population shows no preference between the near and far side .",
    "however , as the resolved star distribution is also asymmetric , it is clear that this assumption is questionable as well .",
    "the source population for the identifiable microlensing events is typically bright ( though unresolved ) stars , and so it too is likely to be asymmetric .",
    "hence , the magnitude of the near - far asymmetry signal as calculated theoretically needs to be amplified by an additional factor .",
    "the values of the asymmetry reported in kerins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) must now be taken as lower limits .",
    "for a spherically symmetric halo , kerins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the underlying pixel - lensing rate in the far - disk of m31 is already more than 5 times the rate of near - disk events .",
    "clearly , a still more substantial asymmetry is expected when the effects reported in this paper are included . however , successful measurement of the component of any asymmetry signal caused by microlensing is now much more difficult . in principle , the additional effects can be modelled and corrected for , but in practice this will make the results less robust .",
    "one way to overcome the difficulties is to limit the study to microlensing events of sources only brighter than some fixed magnitude at baseline .",
    "analysis of the microlensing asymmetry as a function of the source flux will however require a large sample of events with high signal - to - noise ratio .    another way of overcoming the difficulties is to look for an east - west asymmetry rather than a near - far asymmetry .",
    "both the resolved stars and the various groups of variables are more - or - less symmetric about an axis running north - south , as seen in figures  [ fig : ratios ] and [ fig : asone ] .",
    "so , this suggests that the underlying populations of variables are indeed well - mixed and that their asymmetry has a common origin in the dust distribution and possibly some intrinsic disk surface density asymmetry .",
    "if so , we can correct for it by choosing the north - south axis as our reference axis . even though the east - west microlensing asymmetry is less than the near - far asymmetry in the absence of dust problems , it is still asymmetric , as the eastern side contains much of the far disk .",
    "this effect should be detectable in cases when the halos contains a high fraction of massive compact objects .",
    "the point - agape collaboration has constructed a catalogue of the locations , periods and brigtness of 35414 variable stars in m31 .",
    "this is a by - product of our microlensing search .",
    "the variable stars have been classed into four groups  roughly corresponding to population i and ii cepheids , semi - regular and mira variables of short period and long period miras .",
    "the spatial distribution of the variable stars shows a number of interesting trends .",
    "in particular , the brighter and shorter period miras are more centrally concentrated than their fainter and longer period counterparts .",
    "this suggests that the younger populations of agb stars are more extended than the older one .",
    "the variable star catalogue has been correlated with the x - ray point source catalogue available from surveys with the chandra satellite . after taking into account accidental alignments , we find that there are @xmath315 physically meaningful identifications .",
    "this finding will lead to additional complications in the measurement of any asymmetry due to microlensing .",
    "in particular , it may be advantageous to look for an east - west asymmetry rather than a near - far asymmetry .",
