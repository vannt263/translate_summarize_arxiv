    "generalized bernoulli and euler polynomials of degree @xmath0 , complex order @xmath3 and complex argument @xmath4 , denoted respectively by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , can be defined by their generating functions .",

    "in fact , the coefficients in all the usual central - difference formulae for interpolation , numerical differentiation and integration , and differences in terms of derivatives can be expressed in terms of these polynomials ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an explicit formula for the generalized bernoulli polynomials can be found in @xcite .",
    "properties and explicit formulas for the generalized bernoulli and euler numbers can be found in @xcite and in cited references .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have considered these polynomials for large values of @xmath3 , with @xmath0 fixed , and in the present paper we consider @xmath0 as the large parameter , with the other parameters fixed .",
    "we summarize known results from the literature for integer values of @xmath3 , and give more details about these results .",
    "we describe the method for obtaining the coefficients in the expansion for general @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we use two - point taylor expansions for obtaining new type of expansions for general @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis is based on contour integrals that follow from the generating functions of the polynomials .",
    "three different cases arise , depending on @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 otherwise , real or complex .",
    "our approach is based on the cauchy integral @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a circle around the origin , with radius less than @xmath13 .",
    "this follows from .      in this case",
    "the generating series in converges for all finite values of @xmath4 , and , hence , the polynomials @xmath5 have a completely different behavior compared with the general case .",
    "we first follow the approach given in @xcite , and observe that when @xmath3 is a negative integer or zero , say @xmath14 @xmath15 , we can express @xmath5 in terms of a finite sum .",
