    "in recent years considerable experimental and theoretical interest has been focused on the study of artificially structured atoms in semiconductors , such as quantum dots , where few electrons are confined in all three directions ( see for review @xcite ) . in experimentally realized quantum dots , the extension in the @xmath0plane is much larger than in the @xmath1 direction . assuming that the z - extension could be effectively considered zero , the electronic properties in these nanostructures have successfully been described ( see @xcite and references therein ) within the model of the single - electron motion in the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "based on a numerical solution of the coulomb interaction between electrons , a complex ground state behavior ( singlet@xmath2triplet state transitions ) as a function of a magnetic field has been predicted @xcite ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , these ground state transitions for n=2 have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "in present paper we consider an analytically solvable model of two electrons in a quantum dot .",
    "the confinement potential is approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential and the problem of the coulomb interaction is treated exactly .",
    "though this case represents the simplest nontrivial problem with regard to the electron number , mainly the ground states of a two - dimensional quantum dot were analysed either quantitatively @xcite or analytically with some approximations @xcite .",
    "the role of third dimension @xmath3 is also investigated and results on the analysis of the ground as well as excited states are presented .",
    "our analysis is based on the oscillator representation method ( orm ) developed in @xcite .",
    "the orm arisen from the ideas and methods of quantum field theory has been proposed to calculate the binding energy of different systems with fairly arbitrary potentials described by the schrdinger equation @xcite . here ,",
    "for completeness we present briefly the main ideas of the orm .    for any potential admitting the existence of a system bound state",
    "there is always a transformation of the variables that leads to a gaussian asymptotic form for the wave function at large distances .",
    "however , the asymptotic behavior of the coulomb wave functions for large distances does not coincide with this behavior .",
    "therefore , we have to modify the variables in the original schrdinger equation so that the modified equation should have solutions with the gaussian asymptotic behavior . in the coulomb systems ,",
    "this modification is performed by going over to the four - dimensional space , where the wave function of the coulomb system becomes the oscillator one . in an early paper @xcite",
    ", schrdinger has noted the existence of such a transformation which transforms the three - dimensional coulomb system into the oscillator one in the four - dimensional space .",
    "the explicit form of this transformation has been found in @xcite and used to solve the classical kepler problem .    in the next stage , it is necessary to represent the canonical variables ( coordinate and momentum ) of the hamiltonian through the creation and annihilation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 . from the hamiltonian",
    "the pure oscillator part with some , yet unknown , frequency @xmath6 is extracted , i.e. @xmath7 . the remaining part , i.e. the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 , is represented in terms of normal products over @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in addition , it is required that the interaction hamiltonian does not contain terms quadratic in the canonical variables .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the equation @xmath9 which determines @xmath6 , the oscillator frequency , in the orm and is called the _ oscillator representation condition _ ( orc ) @xcite .",
    "similar ideas are used in the hartee - fock - bogoliubov theory to describe different correlations between nucleons moving in average nuclear potential ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "since we change our space variable @xmath10 and a magnetic quantum number @xmath11 will be absorbed by the dimension parameter of the auxiliary space ( @xcite and see below ) , the calculation of the wave function @xmath12 would be equivalent to the calculation of the ground state function of a modified hamiltonian in another dimension . as it has been mentioned above , the wave functions in this auxiliary space should have the oscillator gaussian asymptotic behavior at large distances .",
    "this property is quite natural for our purposes due to physical conditions for the confined electron gas in a quantum dot .",
    "the effective confining potential ( oscillator ) prevents the tendency caused by the coulomb forces to allow electrons to escape and , therefore , it should dominate in the phenomena .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 { \\bigg\\}}\\nonumber\\\\       \\\\ & + & \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 } \\frac{1}{|\\vec r_1 - \\vec r_2| } + h_{spin}\\nonumber \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the effective electron mass .",

    "we have introduced the variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and defined the characteristic lengths : the effective radius @xmath31 and the oscillator length @xmath32 .",
    "these units allow one to define the dimensionless dot size @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the separability and the conservation of the angular momentum lead to a natural ansatz for the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian , eq.([gen ] ) , @xmath34 where the wave functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xcite @xmath37 and the eigenvalues have the form @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonians @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "according to the pauli principle , if the spatial part of the total wave function is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to the inversion @xmath43 , @xmath44 must be the singlet ( triplet ) spin state .",
    "we now concentrate our analysis on the relative motion hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "due to the axial symmetry of the problem , the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian , eq.([rel ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath46 - { 1\\over 2}\\frac{d^2}{dq_z^2 } + { \\hbar^2\\over 2}({\\omega_q}^2 \\rho_q^2 + \\omega_{q_z}^2q_z^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{k\\sqrt{\\hbar\\omega_0}}{2\\sqrt{\\rho_q^2 + q_z^2}}{\\bigg\\ } } \\psi_m ( \\rho_q , q_z ) = u_m \\psi_m ( \\rho_q , q_z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath50 where @xmath11 is a magnetic quantum number .",
    "according to the ansatz of the orm for the wave function , we have to change radial variables so as to obtain an oscillator asymptotic behavior for the wave functions of the transformed equation and then identify this equation with the radial schrdinger equation in a space with different dimension .",
    "in addition , our hamiltonian contains a repulsive centrifugal term , and the wave function @xmath51 must decrease at small distances .",
    "consequently , the transformation to the higher dimensional space is realized by @xcite @xmath52 the parameter @xmath53 can be chosen to compensate completely the repulsion at small distances .",
    "the calculation of the wave function @xmath54 is equivalent to the calculation of the ground state wave functions in a space @xmath55 .",
    "the wave function , eq.([wf ] ) , is a regular one at short distances .",
    "therefore , our wave function possesses necessary properties at short and large distances , i.e. , it is a gaussian one as @xmath56 and goes to zero at @xmath57 .    according to the definition of the wave - function , eq.([wf ] ) , we can transform eq.([sr ] ) into the equation @xmath58 - { 1\\over 2}\\frac{d^2}{dq_z^2 } + { \\hbar^2\\over 2}({\\omega_q}^2 \\rho_q^2 + \\omega_{q_z}^2q_z^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{k\\sqrt{\\hbar\\omega_0}}{2\\sqrt{\\rho_q^2 + q_z^2}}{\\bigg\\ } } \\phi_m ( \\rho_q , q_z ) = u_m \\phi_m ( \\rho_q , q_z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be identified with the equation in space @xmath55 with @xmath59 one can see that the magnetic quantum number @xmath11 does not enter into the schrdinger equation , eq.([sr1 ] ) , in the explicit form .",
    "it is absorbed by the `` dimension '' parameter @xmath53 .",
    "this trick allows one effectively to avoid the problem of calculation of excited states and to perform calculations of the ground state in the auxiliary space @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , eq.([sr1 ] ) contains the oscillator with the coordinate @xmath60 and the other one with the coordinate @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "choosing different ( fixed ) values of @xmath62 allows to study the dependence of the results on the slab thickness .",
    "the condition @xmath63 ensures that we have a genuine two - dimensional problem implying that no particles occupie a quantum mode in the @xmath1-direction @xmath64 . from the analysis of the far - infrared frequencies in the three - dimensional oscillator potential it follows @xcite that the frequency that just forbids occupation of a @xmath1-mode is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the average of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath69 , i.e. , the pure two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "for the case under consideration eq.([sr1 ] ) can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 + { \\hbar^2\\over 2}{\\omega_q}^2 \\rho_q^2 + \\frac{k\\sqrt{\\hbar\\omega_0}}{2\\rho_q}\\ ] ] here the wave function @xmath72 depends only on @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we can identify the operator @xmath74 with the laplacian @xmath75 in auxiliary space @xmath55 if this operator acts on a function depending on the radius only . the wave function @xmath72 in eq.([tdim ] ) can be considered as a wave function of the ground state satisfying the schrdinger equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 taking into account eq.([h0 ] ) , the desired energy @xmath78 is determined by the equation @xmath79 let us express the canonical variables @xmath80 and @xmath81 through the creation and annihilation operators @xmath82 and @xmath5 @xmath83 = \\delta_{ij}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a new oscillator frequency which is defined below .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath84 is defined according to the standard rules @xmath85 substituting the representation , eqs.([rep1 ] ) , into the definition of the hamiltonian , eq.([ham1 ] ) , after some transformations @xmath86 and @xmath87 we obtain @xmath88 where @xmath89 here @xmath90 means a normal product , and we have introduced the notation @xmath91 . according to the orm @xcite , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 does not contain terms quadratic in the canonical variables , i.e. proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "the orc requirement , eq.([cond ] ) , determines the oscillator frequency @xmath6 which is defined in the following way : @xmath93 the quantity @xmath94 is determined with the following equation which is derived from eqs.([gr ] ) , ( [ cond ] ) @xmath95 it is clear that at zero coulomb field ( @xmath96 ) @xmath97 while for @xmath98 eq.([x ] ) defines the effective dependence on the coulomb interaction of the oscillator frequency ( @xmath99 ) .",

    "the main term @xmath114 depends on the coulomb forces as well . in standard schemes",
    "this term corresponds to the noninteracting electrons moving in the external confining potential @xcite . here",
    ", within our model , the interaction modifies the external potential and results in the effective mean field potential of the relative motion .      despite that @xmath63 , in real samples the effect of the third direction should be taken into account , and the prediction based on the pure two - dimensional case is expected to be modified .    taking into account the definition eq.([tdim ] ) , eq.([sr1 ] ) can be written in the following form : @xmath115\\phi_m ( \\rho_q , q_z ) =   0\\ ] ] where @xmath116 since the terms @xmath117 and @xmath118 give the main contribution to the total hamiltonian , the term @xmath119 is related to a dimension of the problem and can be considered as a correction term .",

    "@xmath6 is defined by eq.([omeg ] ) and @xmath124 . finally , applying the definition of the radial excitations ( see eq.([rad ] ) ) for the three - dimensional case , eq.([three ] ) , from the condition , eq.([eps ] )",
    ", we obtain the following expression for the lowest energy level with @xmath125 @xmath126\\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath127 , @xmath128 are defined in appendix b.",

    "summing eqs.([ec ] ) , ( [ es ] ) , ( [ er ] ) ( or eq.([er1 ] ) in the three - dimensional case , respectively ) we are able to investigate different ground states as a function of the dot size @xmath134 and relative strength of the magnetic field @xmath135 .",
    "since the center - of - mass quantum numbers @xmath136 and the quantum number @xmath11 are conserved by the coulomb interaction , the ground state has the quantum numbers @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "comparing the energy with different @xmath140 we can define the ground state energy for a given dot size @xmath100 at different strength of a magnetic field @xmath135 .    in our calculations , we used the effective mass @xmath141 of typical quantum dots for gaas . in fig.1 ( a ) the energy spectra without a contribution of the coulomb forces",
    "are presented .",
    "while without the coulomb forces the ground state is always the state with @xmath142 , the coulomb interaction ( fig.1(b ) ) leads to a sequence of different ground states @xmath143 which are an alternating sequence of singlet and triplet states .    the main mechanism , which defines the optimum quantum number @xmath11 of the ground state , is the interplay between the dot size and the strength of the magnetic field",
    "this question has nicely been discussed for the two - dimensional quantum dots in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the radial excitations with @xmath144 .",
    "if the third extension ( z ) is taken into account , the ground phase transitions are shifted to a higher magnetic field ( see fig.2 ) . since the extension of the slab is inversely proportional to the confining frequency @xmath145 , the thicker the slab the larger value of the magnetic field is needed to observe the ground state transition @xmath146 .",
    "this fact has to be taken into account in experiments .",
    "the singlet - triplet ground phase transition occurs when the following condition is fulfilled @xmath147 . for a negative lande factor the spin - splitting energy in a magnetic field will lower the energy of the spin @xmath148 component of the triplet states .",
    "in particular , the relation @xmath149 ( m odd ) defines the point when the singlet phase ceases to exist @xcite . beyond this point",
    "we can observe phase transitions between triplet states defined by the condition @xmath150 ( m odd ) .",
    "therefore , at strong magnetic field @xmath151 , i.e. in the limit @xmath152 and @xmath153 , for singlet - triplet phase transitions @xmath154 we obtain @xmath155f_{st}(\\gamma)\\\\ f_{st}(\\gamma ) = 1 + { \\gamma\\over 6}\\frac{5 + 2|m|}{(3 - 2|m|)(1 - 2|m| ) } + o(\\gamma^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for triplet - triplet phase transitions @xmath156 ( m odd ) @xmath157 in these expressions the pure two - dimensional case is realized in the limit @xmath158 .",
    "the higher excitations in the two - electron quantum dots the lesser the influence of the coulomb forces on the `` crossing '' of levels .",
    "for example , the value of the parameter @xmath159 for singlet - triplet phase transitions decreases with increasing radial quantum number @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , for the two - dimensional system we have obtained the following relation between parameters @xmath159 for a singlet - triplet transition at different @xmath107 @xmath160 while the interplay between the magnetic field and the coulomb forces determines the features of a phase transition ( singlet @xmath2 triplet ) for the ground state ( @xmath139 ) @xcite , mainly the magnetic field leads to the phase transitions for the high - lying states @xmath161 .",
    "the model allows the calculation of the magnetization @xmath162 .",
    "since at low energy the magnetization is closely related to the slope of the ground energy , at @xmath163 k we obtain for @xmath139 @xmath164\\\\ f_{\\mu}(\\gamma ) & = & 1 + { \\gamma\\over 6}\\frac{1}{1 - 2|m| } + o(\\gamma^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it was mentioned in @xcite , the phase ground state transitions would be reflected in sharp discontinuities in the magnetization .",
    "the above exact expression can be useful for the analysis of the experimental features related to the phase transitions .",
    "also , it allows one to control the approximation made in the calculations in @xcite .",
    "within the proposed model the analytical expressions for the energy levels and the magnetization of the two - electron quantum dots are obtained .",
    "the coulomb interaction is treated exactly and from the analysis of the energy spectrum it follows that the interplay between the coulomb forces and the magnetic field are an important ingredients for the prediction of the ground phase transitions .",
    "the coulomb forces lead to the modification of the external potential and give rize to the effective confining potential of the relative motion .",
    "their contribution in the properties of single - electron states decreases with the increasing of the radial quantum number @xmath107 .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the third extension ( z ) modifies the value of a magnetic filed needed to observe the phase transition : the thicker slab the larger value of a magnetic filed .",
    "we hope that the results presented here could be useful for the analysis of the electron properties in two - electron quantum dots and allow to make a conclusion on a deviation of the real confining potential from the harmonic oscillator one .",
    "here we describe some details of the calculations of the quantity @xmath166 taking into account the following equations @xmath167 the fact that @xmath168 and eq.([vec ] ) , after some transformation we obtain @xmath169 where @xmath170 . using these results , we have for eq.([hi ] ) @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 in a particular case , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 for @xmath176 we have @xmath177~.\\ ] ]",
