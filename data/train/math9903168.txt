    "this is a very broad question",
    ". we shall be rather modest and content ourselves with the answer found by hamilton and jacobi : @xmath0 according to them , mechanics studies emergence of the thick curves via interference of the thin curves . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the thin curves are replaced by hypersurfaces ( thick curves remain curves ) .",
    "the picture may represent the spacetime with worldlines of particles appearing as wave packets .",
    "a bit more abstractly , it may represent an extended configuration space .",
    "it may also be the ordinary space with rays of light . and",
    "after all , you may see similar phenomena on folded curtains .",
    "the thin hypersurfaces are supposed to obey certain law ( the hamilton ",
    "jacobi ( or eikonal ) equation ) . it may be stated ( a bit informally ) as follows : @xmath1 around each point we have a hypersurface ( so - called wave diagram , or indicatrix ) and if a thin hypersurface passes through the point , the next one should touch the diagram ( the huyghens principle ) .",
    "the vector represents the direction of the thick curve through the point .",
    "of course , everything is understood infinitesimally : the picture actually represents the tangent space at the point and the hyperplanes are the zero- and the one - level of the differential of the wave phase . the wave diagram can be used to measure lengths of vectors : by definition , the diagram consists of vectors of the length one .",
    "obviously , the thick curves are extremal with respect to this metric ( this is due to the fact that the drawn vector points to the point of tangency ) . noether theorem is visually obvious as well : on the first picture you can imagine that we started with one set of thin curves and the other one was obtained by applying an infinitesimal symmetry .",
    "there are several problems that we passed in silence .",
    "the most serious one is non - naturalness : in lagrangian mechanics we may add the differential of any function to the lagrangian without changing anything essential .",
    "it is quite clear what is the corresponding fact in the wave picture : the waves are not just complex functions , but rather sections of a line bundle .",
    "similarly , the phase of a wave is a section of the corresponding principal @xmath2 bundle .",
    "even if the bundle is trivial , only its bundle structure is natural .",
    "this modification may seem minute , but pictures change rather dramatically , as we have one more dimension :    @xmath3    in the principal @xmath2 bundle @xmath4 we have an invariant field of cones . to obtain a lagrangian",
    "we choose a local trivialization .",
    "let @xmath5 be the corresponding flat connection 1-form .",
    "we intersect the cones with the levels @xmath6 and project the intersections to the base ; in this way we obtain the wave diagrams .",
    "jacobi equation says that wave phase ( a section of @xmath4 ) should be tangent to the cones . in other words , they are the monge cones for the h - j equation .",
    "the `` worldlines '' are the ( bi)characteristics , i.e. the curves along which the phase touches the cones .",
    "we shall consider this picture as fundamental .",
    "we want to find characteristics of a field of cones and it is only a one - parameter group of symmetry that makes it into a variational problem .",
    "the space of characteristics is a contact manifold ; the @xmath2 symmetry makes it into a @xmath2 bundle with a connection ( ignoring some obvious problems ) . from this point of view , this @xmath2 bundle over the phase space is more fundamental than the phase space itself .",
    "naturality of this approach is advocated further in @xcite and it is used in a substantial way in the book @xcite .",
    "now imagine that the field of cones is invariant with respect to some ( local ) lie group @xmath7 containing our @xmath2 .",
    "this symmetry would be hidden from us if we saw only the base and not the bundle @xmath4 itself ( unless the @xmath2 were in its centre ) , even if we passed to hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "we may use @xmath7 to reduce the problem ( via contact reduction ) .",
    "the classical example is for two - dimensional abelian @xmath7 .",
    "we take a vector field @xmath8 from @xmath9 , make quotient of @xmath4 by @xmath8 and find a field of cones in the quotient  they are the contours of the original cones when seen in the direction of @xmath8 . to find the characteristics in @xmath4 it is sufficient to find them in the reductions and to compute some derivatives .",
    "the proper setting for a general @xmath7 is contact geometry : we want to find the characteristics of a field of hyperplanes and we use a symmetry group @xmath7 to reduce the problem .",
    "having solved the reductions we solve the original problem simply by computing derivatives . in this respect",
    "it is slightly better than symplectic reduction .",
    "and there is one more point : we can take a different @xmath2 in the group @xmath7 and make @xmath4 a bundle in this different way .",
    "the two mechanical ( or variational ) systems are thus made equivalent .",
    "this is the duality mentioned in the title .",
    "the two systems have different phase spaces , but they share the @xmath2-bundle over their phase spaces .",
    "everything is very simple and we could end here .",
    "the remaining sections should only provide examples and more precise definitions and make the paper completely selfcontained .",
    "but we should also return to our motivation and explain what is the high - frequency approximation in this picture .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is a principal @xmath2 or @xmath10 bundle and @xmath11 is an invariant differential operator @xmath12 .",
    "if we confine ourselves to equivariant functions with some weight @xmath13 , @xmath11 becomes an operator @xmath14 on this associated line bundle .",
    "for example , if @xmath15 and the group acts by shifting @xmath16 , @xmath14 is the schroedinger operator .",
    "if @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 , each of its fourier components satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "so this is the relation classical  quantum in our picture : all admissible @xmath20 s are collected in a single equation @xmath18 and the classical theory describes singularities of solutions of this wave equation .",
    "in this section we review some notions of contact geometry .",
    "fortunately , we need only elementary things .",
    "nice exposition can be found in the ems article @xcite .    a contact structure on a manifold @xmath21 is a maximally non - integrable field of hyperplanes @xmath22 . for a while ,",
    "let @xmath22 denote any subbundle of @xmath23 ( with arbitrary codimension ) .",
    "if @xmath8 is a vector field , let @xmath24 denote the infinitesimal deformation of @xmath22 by the flow of @xmath8 .",
    "it may be defined by @xmath25\\mbox { mod } c$ ] , where @xmath26 is extended to a section of @xmath22 in an arbitrary way .",
    "if @xmath8 is a section of @xmath22 as well , @xmath27\\mbox { mod } c$ ] is completely local in both arguments , so that we have a map @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a field of hyperplanes ( a codimension - one subbundle ) , it is called maximally nonintegrable if the bilinear form @xmath29 ( with values in the line - bundle @xmath30 ) is everywhere regular . in other words",
    ", @xmath31 is contact iff for any infinitesimal deformation @xmath32 there is ( unique ) section of @xmath22 with flow generating this deformation .",
    "a simple consequence of the last statement is gray s stability theorem .",
    "if @xmath33 is a compact manifold with time - dependent contact structure and @xmath34 is constant on some subset @xmath35 , there is a flow of @xmath21 fixing the points of @xmath36 that generates @xmath34 from @xmath37 .",
    "compactness is used to ensure completness of vector fields .",
    "it is not needed if we want a local statement .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 is fixed at a point ( and @xmath38 restricted to a finite interval ) , we still have a local diffeomorphism close to the point . as a consequence ,",
    "all contact structures in a given ( necessarily odd ) dimension are locally equivalent ( darboux theorem ) .    and here is another application .",
    "a vector field @xmath8 on a contact manifold @xmath31 is _ contact _ , if its flow preserves @xmath22 .",
    "for any section @xmath39 of @xmath30 there is unique contact @xmath8 equal to @xmath39 mod @xmath22 . to see it ,",
    "take any @xmath40 equal to @xmath39 mod @xmath22 ; the deformation @xmath41 can be removed by unique section of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath39 is called the _ contact hamiltonian _ of @xmath8 .",
    "contact and symplectic geometries are closely related .",
    "we shall need this example .",
    "let @xmath42 be a pricipal @xmath2 ( or @xmath10 ) bundle and let @xmath21 be equipped with an invariant contact structure .",
    "suppose furthemore that the hyperplanes are transversal to the fibres , so that they may be interpreted as a connection .",
    "its curvature is a symplectic form on @xmath21 .",
    "a contact vector field commuting with the @xmath2 action ( i.e. with invariant contact hamiltonian ) is projected to a hamiltonian vector field on the base : using the connection 1-form to trivialize @xmath30 , an invariant contact hamiltonian becomes a function on the base  the sought hamiltonian .",
    "the somewhat mystic generation of vector fields by functions in symplectic geometry is here a bit more visual : hamiltonian is simply the vertical part of the vector field .",
    "interesting geometry arises even if @xmath22 is not everywhere transversal to the fibres .",
    "the projection of these dangerous points is easily seen to be a smooth hypersurface .",
    "the symplectic form diverges at the hypersurface and the hypersurface itself carries a contact structure ( this is our first encounter with contact reduction ) .    let us now consider a field of hyperplanes @xmath22 without assuming complete nonintegrability . a section of @xmath22 lying in the kernel of @xmath29 is called a _",
    "characteristic vector field_. the flow of a characteristic field preserves @xmath22 .",
    "suppose now that the rank of @xmath29 is constant .",
    "we see that the manifold is locally a product of a contact manifold and @xmath43 ( the characteristic directions ) , where @xmath44 is the dimension of the kernel of @xmath29 .",
    "globally we have a foliation with @xmath44-dimensional leaves , called _",
    "characteristics_. if the foliation is actually a fibration , its base is contact .",
    "this permits us to see the proof of gray s theorem and the generation of contact fields by contact hamiltonians from a `` space - time '' point of view .",
    "let @xmath33 be as before .",
    "on @xmath45 we define a hyperplane field  we simply add @xmath46 to @xmath34 .",
    "the characteristic curves are the worldlines of the flow .",
    "similarly , for a given section of @xmath30 on a contact @xmath31 , we construct a hyperplane field on @xmath45 in the obvious way ; characterictics are again the worldlines of the flow .",
    "the classical example of a contact manifold is the space of contact elements ( i.e. hyperplanes in the tangent space ) of a manifold @xmath21 , which we denote as @xmath47 . in other words",
    ", @xmath47 is the projective bundle associated with @xmath48 .",
    "the field @xmath22 is given as follows : take an @xmath49 ; it corresponds to a hyperplane @xmath50 in @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the natural projection .",
    "then @xmath53 is @xmath22 at @xmath54 .    contact geometry , in particular on @xmath47 ,",
    "was invented by lie to give a geometrical meaning to first order pde s and to lagrange method of characteristics .",
    "suppose @xmath55 is a hypersurface ; it will represent the equation .",
    "any hypersurface @xmath56 can be lifted to @xmath47 : for any point @xmath57 take the hyperplane @xmath58 to be a point of the lift @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath59 is a _ legendre submanifold _ of @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath59 has the maximal dimension ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "@xmath62 is said to solve the equation if @xmath63 .",
    "this has a nice interpretation due to monge : for any @xmath64 we take the enveloping cone of the hyperplanes @xmath65 in @xmath66 . in this way",
    "we obtain a field of cones in @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath62 solves the equation if it is tangent to the cones .",
    "lie s point of view is to forget about @xmath21 and to take as a solution any legendre submanifold contained in @xmath67 .",
    "such a solution may look singular in @xmath21 ( singularities emerge upon the projection @xmath52 ; actually , many things classically called functions or hypersurfaces , are in fact legendre submanifolds of something  we shall meet the example of `` generating functions '' of contact transformations ) .",
    "this definition uses only the contact structure on @xmath47 and thus allows using the entire ( pseudo)group of contact transformations .",
    "the hyperplane field @xmath22 cuts a hyperplane field @xmath68 on @xmath67 ( there may be points where the contact hyperplane touches @xmath67 ; generally they are isolated and we will ignore them ) .",
    "the form @xmath29 becomes degenerate when restricted from @xmath22 to @xmath68 ; in @xmath67 , we have one characteristic direction everywhere .",
    "for example , if the monge cones coming from @xmath67 are the null cones of some pseudo - riemannian metrics on @xmath21 then the projections of the characteristics are the light - like geodesics in @xmath21 .",
    "legendre submanifolds contained in @xmath67 are woven from characteristics . to find them ( i.e. to solve the equation )",
    ", we have to take local quotients of @xmath67 by characteristics and pull their legendre submanifolds back to @xmath67 .",
    "hypersurfaces @xmath55 often come from an equation of the type @xmath18 , where @xmath69 is a linear ( pseudo)differential operator .",
    "we shall be very brief and prove nothing .",
    "take the symbol @xmath70 of @xmath11 ( a function on @xmath48 defined by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the degree of @xmath11 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "the equation @xmath75 specifies a hypersurface @xmath55 .",
    "singularities of solutions of @xmath18 are located on `` hypersurfaces '' solving the equation corresponding to @xmath67 .      before proceeding to group actions and reductions",
    ", we have to describe the _ contact product_. if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are contact , there is no contact structure on @xmath78 .",
    "the contact product @xmath79 is actually a circle bundle over @xmath78 . in @xmath78",
    "there is an obvious field of codimension - two subspaces .",
    "we take all the hyperplanes containing these subspaces  they form the manifold @xmath79 .",
    "contact structure on @xmath79 is defined similarly to the one on @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath80 is a local diffeomorphism preserving the contact structure then the graph of @xmath81 in @xmath78 can be uniquely lifted to a legendre submanifold of @xmath79 .",
    "vice versa , any legendre submanifold @xmath82 whose projection is the graph of something gives rise to such a @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath83 is called ( a bit improperly ) the _ generating function _ of @xmath81 .",
    "notice that @xmath84 ; the generating function of a @xmath85 is therefore a `` hypersurface '' in @xmath86 .    like in symplectic geometry ,",
    "it is natural to call legendre submanifolds of @xmath87 contact relations ; they can be composed under some qualifications on intersections . and similarly to @xmath88 , legendre submanifolds of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a lie groupoid ,",
    "can be composed .",
    "this represents composition of singularities in the groupoid algebra .",
    "the reader may like to define contact groupoids .",
    "now we classify contact homogeneous spaces .",
    "an invariant contact structure on @xmath91 can be pulled back to a left - invariand hyperplane field on @xmath7 ; its characteristics are cosets of @xmath50 .",
    "hence we are done : local @xmath7-homogeneous contact spaces are classified by hyperplanes in @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath92 is such a subspace , let @xmath93 be the stabilizer @xmath94\\ss\\frak l\\}$ ] of @xmath95 intersected with @xmath95 ; set @xmath96 . for global lie groups",
    "there is no reason why this @xmath50 should be closed .",
    "@xmath7-homogeneous contact spaces are classified by pairs @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a closed subgroup with the lie algebra @xmath93 .",
    "these spaces are closely related to coadjoint orbits .",
    "choose an @xmath99 with the kernel @xmath95 .",
    "if the orbit @xmath100 is homogeneous then @xmath101 or @xmath102 ( with the obvious contact structure coming from the symplectic form on @xmath100 ) .",
    "if it is not , @xmath91 is a principal bundle with one - parameter group over @xmath100 .",
    "these two possibilities appear according to whether @xmath103 is contained in @xmath95 or not ; in the second case , @xmath104 is the algebra of the structure group .",
    "the constrains of globality are well visible here : in the first case there are none while in the second case the periods of the symplectic form on @xmath100 have to be co - mesurable ( and it is also sufficient if @xmath7 is simply - conected ) .",
    "now we shall discuss contact reductions .",
    "suppose @xmath7 acts on a contact space @xmath21 respecting the contact structure .",
    "let @xmath105 consist of the points of @xmath21 where the image of @xmath9 is contained in @xmath22 .",
    "if the action of @xmath7 is locally free , @xmath105 is a submanifold , @xmath22 cuts a hyperplane field there and its characteristics are the orbits of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 acts properly there ( so that @xmath106 is a manifold ) , @xmath107 is the _ contact reduction _ ; @xmath108 . also notice that @xmath7-invariant legendre sumbanifolds of @xmath21 are contained in @xmath105 and they are the preimages of legendre submanifolds of @xmath109 .",
    "these claims are easy to see .",
    "the contact hamiltonians of @xmath9 vanish at @xmath105 ; because the action is locally free , their differentials are linearly independent there .",
    "it follows that @xmath105 is a submanifold of codimension equal to @xmath110 and it is nowhere touched by @xmath22 .",
    "the vector fields generated by @xmath9 are characteristic on @xmath105 ( they preserve the hyperplane field ) ; for dimensional reasons they generate all the characteristic fields .    to reduce all the parts of @xmath21 ( not just @xmath105 )",
    "we are sometimes forced to leave global geometry .",
    "let @xmath7 be a ( local ) group acting locally freely on @xmath21 .",
    "for any point @xmath64 let @xmath111 consist of the vectors in @xmath112 mapped into @xmath22 at @xmath54 , and for any hyperplane @xmath113 let @xmath114 consist of @xmath54 s where @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath116 is the contact reduction at @xmath95 ; if @xmath117 is not closed , it makes sense only locally .",
    "for example , @xmath118 is the locally homogeneous space corresponding to @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath119 is not contained in @xmath95 , @xmath104 is a residual one - parameter symmetry making @xmath120 locally into a principal bundle over a symplectic space .",
    "let us describe two examples connected with symplectic geometry .",
    "let @xmath121 be @xmath2 ( or @xmath10 ) bundles with contact @xmath21 s and symplectic @xmath122 s , as above .",
    "let @xmath2 act diagonally on @xmath79 ; then @xmath123 . the generating function ( recall that it is in fact a legendre submanifold ) of a @xmath2 equivariant contact map @xmath124",
    "is contained in @xmath125 ( as it is @xmath2 invariant ) ; therefore , it is the preimage of a legendre submanifold @xmath126 .",
    "the map @xmath81 gives rise to a symplectic map @xmath127 between the bases ; @xmath83 is called a generating function of @xmath127 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath128 acts on @xmath21 ( the @xmath2 is the structure group of the bundle ) , the contact reductions of @xmath21 give rise to the sympectic reductions of @xmath122 ( a hyperplane in @xmath129 is the same as an element of @xmath130 ) .      finally , let us describe how contact reduction can help us in constructing the characteristic foliation of a hyperplane field .",
    "it is very simple : the reduction described above can be applied if @xmath22 is any hyperplane field ( not necessarily contact ) .",
    "we find characteristics in the reduced manifold ( this is the reduced problem ) and we know that original characteristics are contained in their preimages .",
    "the problem is solved at this point : these preimages yield characteristics by a very simple procedure , generalizing the method of complete integrals .",
    "this is slightly better than symplectic reduction , since there solving reductions does not solve the original problem ( actually , using the connection between symplectic and contact reduction we see that it is only necessary to compute an idefinite integral )",
    ".    here are the details .",
    "suppose @xmath21 is a manifold with a hyperplane field @xmath22 and that a ( local ) group @xmath7 acts on @xmath21 preserving @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath111 is defined as above ; it is constant along the characteristics , because the action of @xmath7 on @xmath21 gives an action on the local quotients by characteristics ( a contact version of noether theorem ) . in other words ,",
    "the subspaces @xmath131 contain characteristics .",
    "we may take @xmath132 and find characteristics there ; the characteristics of @xmath31 are in their preimages .",
    "we suppose that these preimages form a foliation .",
    "we are in this situation : we have a foliation of @xmath21 with leaves containing the characteristics and moreover the tangent spaces of the leaves are contained in @xmath22 .",
    "the following is a very minute generalization of the method of complete integrals .",
    "take an open subset @xmath133 where the foliation becomes a fibration @xmath134 .",
    "the hyperplanes @xmath22 in @xmath135 are projected to hyperplanes in @xmath136 .",
    "this projected hyperplane is constant along characteristics . and vice versa ",
    "this property specifies characteristics .",
    "the problem is solved .",
    "we only consider very simple examples : right - invariant hypersurfaces @xmath137 for various lie groups @xmath7 .",
    "such a hypersurface is specified by a cone in @xmath130 or by its dual ( possibly singular ) cone in @xmath9 ; the field of the monge cones is generated from the latter by right translation .",
    "if we choose a ( closed , if we want to be global ) one - parameter subgroup @xmath138 , we receive a variational problem on @xmath139 .    to find the characteristics in @xmath67 we use the contact reduction : we either set @xmath140 in the method described or we make reduction of @xmath141 and look what happens with @xmath67 ( these two methods are of course almost identical ) .",
    "our first example is the euclidean group @xmath142 . in this case",
    ", there are only two non - conjugate @xmath95 s : either the abelian ideal of @xmath9 or anything else .",
    "the first case is trivial ( characteristics with this @xmath95 are the straight lines in the abelian normal subgroup ( or its cosets ) touching the monge cones ) .",
    "let us reduce the second case .",
    "we find this equipment :    @xmath143 the wheel is funny not just because of its shape . instead of rolling on the road",
    "it remains still and it is the road that rolls around the wheel . before being more explicit , let us describe the corresponding variational system in the euclidean plane , i.e. in @xmath139 , where @xmath144 .",
    "we draw tangent vectors directly in the plane . to obtain the wave diagram of a point , rotate the funny wheel for @xmath145 around the point .",
    "the extremals of this system are the trajectories swept by the points of the plane of the road ; among them , the evolvents of the wheel ( these are the trajectories of the points lying directly on the road ) . to find the trajectories it is enough to compute an indefinite integral ( the length of arcs of the wheel )",
    "the reason behind is the residual one - parameter symmetry mentioned above ( we shall make it explicit in a moment ) .    now some details .",
    "@xmath146 is a semidirect product of @xmath147 and a vector plane @xmath148 .",

    "( this choice does not matter  we may choose another origin of @xmath146 ) , turn it for @xmath145 and place it into the plane @xmath150 ; this will be the intersection of @xmath4 with the monge cone .",
    "the adjoint action of @xmath7 on @xmath4 is as the defining affine action , but rotated for @xmath145 .",
    "now we choose an @xmath151 ; for definiteness , let it contain the algebra of @xmath147 .",
    "we may visualize @xmath142 with the left - invariant contact structure generated by @xmath95 directly in the plane @xmath4 ; in this way it becomes a double - cover of @xmath152 .",

    "the left action of @xmath7 is represented by the adjoint action on @xmath4 and there is a one - parameter right action preserving the contact structure ( a line in @xmath148 )  translating the point of the flag along its line .",
    "the contact plane at @xmath156 touches the monge cone if the line of its flag touches the wheel .",
    "everything is very simple now .",
    "we know the projections of the characteristics to the quotient @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the one - parametric right symmetry , i.e. to the space of oriented lines in @xmath4 ( this space inherits a symplectic form from the contact structure on @xmath7 ) .",
    "the image consists of the lines tangent to the wheel .",
    "we have to lift it back to @xmath7 , moving the point orthogonally to the line .",

    "this example is trivial because all the reductions of @xmath141 are one - dimensional ; there is nothing to compute .",
    "the final example is @xmath160 , @xmath144 .",
    "it is very similar to @xmath146-case .",
    "there is a little problem : to find the lagrangian ( or the wave diagrams ) from the monge cones we need a local trivialization of @xmath161 .",
    "in the previous examples we used natural global trivializations ( the groups were semidirect products ) . rather than making arbitrary choices , we use the natural ( non - flat ) connection ( orthogonal to the fibres ) .",
    "we use it to find wave diagrams as we used flat connections . however , its curvature ( the area form on @xmath162 ) has to be understood as a magnetic field and its potential has to be added to the lagrangian ( so the unnaturality is swept under this rug ) .",
    "the system looks as follows .",
    "choose a monge cone in @xmath9 .",
    "identify @xmath139 with the unit sphere in @xmath9 . to find the wave diagram at a point of the sphere ,",
    "take the tangent plane , intersect with the cone and rotate for @xmath163 .",
    "this time all the @xmath95 s are mutually conjugated .",
    "the funny wheel idea works as before ( the wheel is the intersection of the sphere with the monge cone ) , just instead of planes and lines we have spheres and great circles .",
    "the problem is reduced to computing lengths of arcs of the wheel .",
    "characteristics are closed if the perimeter of the wheel is a rational multiple of @xmath164 .",
    "there is an alternative description of the way the road sphere moves on the wheel sphere .",
    "intersect the dual cone with the sphere and consider the paralel transport along the curve ; it extends naturally to a motion of the sphere .",
    "this is familiar from the motion of rigid body @xcite .",
    "it is no accident : the body is described by a field of cones in @xmath165 ( one @xmath10 is the time and the other is the action ) ; the reductions of this group are as those of @xmath166 .",
