    "group field theories ( gfts ) @xcite were developed at first as a generalisation of matrix models for 2d quantum gravity to 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions to produce a lattice formulation of topological theories .",
    "more recently , they have been developed further in the context of spin foam models for quantum gravity , as a tool to overcome the limitations of working with a fixed lattice in the non - topological case . in our opinion , however , their role in quantum gravity research goes much beyond this original scope , and gfts should be seen as a fundamental formulation of quantum gravity and not just as an auxiliary tool . the bottom line of this perspective , here only tentatively outlined and still to be fully realised , hopefully , after much more work , can be summarised as follows",
    ": gfts are quantum field theories * of * spacetime ( as opposed to qfts _ on _ spacetime ) , that describe the dynamics of both its topology and geometry in local , simplicial , covariant , algebraic terms , and that encompass most of the other approaches to non - perturbative quantum gravity , providing a link between them and at the same time going beyond the limitations of each",
    ". it will be clear from this brief account that we have just began to explore the structure of these models , and that very little is known about them ; at the same time , we hope it would also be clear that what is known is enough for suggesting that in the gft framework lies the potential for important developments towards a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "the idea of defining a quantum field theory _ of _ geometry , i.e. a qft on superspace ( the space of 3-geometries ) for given spatial topology , say @xmath0 , was already explored in the past @xcite .",
    "the context was then a quantum cosmologyone , i.e. a global one .",
    "such a theory would produce , in its perturbative expansion , a sum over different topologies each corresponding to a possible feynman graph of the theory and to a possible interaction process for universesrepresented by the basic 3-sphere .",
    "the spatial topology change would be limited therefore to a changing number of disjoint copies of @xmath0 .",
    "the field would represent a 2nd quantisation of the canonical wave function on superspace , here describing the one - particle sectorof the theory , turning it into an operator . the quantum amplitude for each feynman graph , corresponding to a particular spacetime topology with @xmath1 boundary components ,",
    "would be given by a path integral for gravity on the given topology , i.e. by a sum - over - histories quantisation of gravity with amplitude for each history obtained by exponentiating ( @xmath2 times ) the einstein - hilbert action for general relativity .",
    "the difficulties in making mathematical sense of the continuum path integral itself are well - known , and it is a safe guess that the technical difficulties in turning this 3rd quantisation idea in a mathematically rigorous framework in the continuum are even more formidable .",
    "also , such a cosmological setting ( having a wave function and then a field for the whole universe ) presents notorious interpretation problems , here only enhanced by treating also space topology as a variable ) and lead to more than a few worries about the physical meaning of the whole setting .",
    "the general idea however is appealing in that such a framework would provide a natural mechanism for implementing topology change in quantum gravity and a prescription for weighting different spacetime topologies within a covariant sum - over - histories quantisation of gravity .",
    "in particular one could imagine that the interpretation issues , if not the technical difficulties , would be made easier if it was possible to implement the above ideas in a * local * framework , for example by generalising the superspace construction to _ open chunks of the universe _",
    ", for example 3-balls , and then describing in a 3rd quantised language the interaction of these local pieces of the universe generating dynamically the whole universe and spacetime through their evolution .",
    "again , however , the continuum setting seems to prevent a rigorous realisation of these ideas . by turning to a * simplicial * description of spacetime ,",
    "the group field theory formalism gives a mathematically better defined realisation of these appealing ideas , providing a discrete sum - over - histories quantisation of gravity , and allowing an easier physical interpretation , since the picture of geometry and topology it is based on is intrinsically _",
    "the geometry of a simplicial space ( a triangulation ) is fully characterised by a countable , if not finite , number of variables only , i.e. superspace becomes discrete , thus facilitating greatly the task of defining a field theory on it .",
    "also , it is known that every closed d - dimensional simplicial complex can be obtained by gluing fundamental d - dimensional building blocks , each with the topology of a d - ball , along their boundaries ( given by ( d-1)-simplices ) . a * local * , and thus more physically sensible , realisation of the idea of a field theory on superspace is then possible , by considering first a wave function associated to each ( d-1)-dimensional simplicial building block of space ( if spacetime is d - dimensional ) , i.e. a functional of the geometry of one of them only , and then second quantising it , i.e. turning it into an operator",
    ". the quantum geometry of larger blocks of a spatial simplicial complex will be encoded in the tensor product of such wave functions / operators for the individual building blocks forming them .",
    "the issue is then : how to characterise the geometry of each simplicial building block , and thus of the full simplicial complex ?",
    "in other words , which variables to choose to represent the arguments of our wave function / field ? here",
    "group field theories differ from other simplicial approaches to quantum gravity , and follow instead the path traced by loop quantum gravity , in that they seek to describe quantum geometry in terms of algebraic data , i.e. group and representation variables .",
    "this descends @xcite from the classical description of gravity in terms of connection variables valued in the lie algebra of the lorentz group of the appropriate dimension , discretised to give elementary group valued parallel transports along paths in the ( dual of the ) simplicial complex , or equivalently in terms of lie algebra - valued ( d-2)-forms as in bf - like formulations of the same @xcite , discretized to give the volumes of the ( d-2)-dimensional cells of the simplicial complex , labelled by irreducible representations of the lorentz group .",
    "the equivalence between these two sets of variables is given by the harmonic analysis on the group manifold that expresses their conjugate nature .",
    "more concretely , the field is taken to be a @xmath3-valued function of d group elements , for a generic group @xmath4 , one for each of the d boundary ( d-2)-faces of the ( d-1)-simplex the field corresponds to : @xmath5 the order of the arguments in the field corresponds to a choice of orientation for the ( d-1)-simplex it represents ; therefore it is natural to impose the field to be invariant under even permutations of its arguments ( that do not change the orientation ) and to turn into its own complex conjugate under odd permutations ; this choice ensures that only orientable complexes are generated in the feynman expansion of the field theory @xcite .",
    "other symmetry properties can also be considered @xcite .",
    "the closure of the d ( d-2)-faces to form a ( d-1)-simplex is expressed algebraically by the invariance of the field under diagonal action of the group @xmath4 on the d arguments of the field : @xmath6 , which is also imposed @xcite .",
    "this is also the simplicial counterpart of the lorentz gauge invariance of first order gravity actions .",
    "as anticipated , the field can be expanded in modes using harmonic analysis on the group : @xmath7 with the @xmath8 s labelling representations of @xmath4 , the @xmath9 s vector indices in the representation spaces , and the @xmath10 s being intertwiners of the group @xmath4 , an orthonormal basis of which is labelled by an extra parameter @xmath11 . that this decomposition is possible is not guaranteed in general but it is in fact true for the models being developed up to now , all based on the lorentz group or on extensions of it .",
    "group variables represent thus the gft analogue of configuration space , while the representation parameters label the corresponding momentum space .",
    "geometrically , the group variables , as said , represent parallel transport of a connection along elementary paths dual to the ( d-2)-faces , while the representations @xmath8 can be put in correspondence with the volumes of the same ( d-2)-faces , the details of this correspondence depending on the specific model @xcite .",
    "the 1st quantisation of a geometric ( d-1)-simplex in terms of these variables was performed in great detail in the 3 and 4-dimensional case in @xcite , but a similar analysis is lacking in higher dimensions . a simplicial space built out of @xmath12 such ( d-1)-simplices",
    "is then described by the tensor product of @xmath12 such wave functions , at the 1st quantised level , with suitable constraints implementing their gluing , i.e. the fact that some of their ( d-2)-faces are identified , at the algebraic level .",
    "for example , a state describing two ( d-1)-simplices glued along one common ( d-2)-face would be represented by : @xmath13 , where the gluing is along the face labelled by the representation @xmath14 , and effected by the contraction of the corresponding vector indices ( of course , states corresponding to disjoint ( d-1)-simplices are also allowed ) .",
    "the corresponding state in configuration variables is : @xmath15 .",
    "we see that states of the theory are then labelled , in momentum space , by _ spin networks _ of the group @xmath4 ( see chapters by thiemann and perez ) .",
    "the second quantisation of the theory is obtained by promoting these wave functions to operators , as said , and the field theory is then specified by a choice of field action and by the definition of the partition function of the corresponding quantum theory . the partition function",
    "is then expressed perturbatively in terms of feynman diagrams , as we are going to discuss .",
    "this implicitly assumes a description of the dynamics in terms of creation and annihilation of ( d-1)-simplices , whose interaction generates a ( discrete ) spacetime as a particular interaction process ( feynman diagram ) @xcite .",
    "this picture has not been worked out in detail yet ; in other words , no clear fock structure on the space of states has been constructed , and no explicit creation / annihilation operators , acting on a suitably third quantised vacuum , resulting from the classical hamiltonian structure of a group field theory , have been defined .",
    "work on this is in progress @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of the above kinematical structure , spacetime is viewed as emerging from the interaction of fundamental building blocks of space , and inherits therefore their simplicial characterisation , in that it is represented by a d - dimensional simplicial complex .",
    "more precisely , any such simplicial spacetime is understood as a particular interaction process among ( d-1)-simplices , described in term of feynman diagrams in typical quantum field - theoretic perturbative expansion . with this in mind , it is easy to understand the choice of classical field action in group field theories .",
    "this action , in configuration space , has the general qft structure :    @xmath16    where the choice of kinetic and interaction functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 define the specific model considered .",
    "of course , the same action can be written in momentum space after harmonic decomposition on the group manifold .",
    "the combinatorial structure of the dynamics is evident from the pairing of the arguments of these two functions and from their degree in field variables : the interaction term describes the interaction of d+1 ( d-1)-simplices to form a d - simplex by gluing along their ( d-2)-faces ( arguments of the fields ) , that are pairwise linked by the interaction vertex .",
    "the nature of this interaction is specified by the choice of function @xmath18 .",
    "the ( quadratic ) kinetic term involves two fields each representing a given ( d-1)-simplex seen from one of the two d - simplices ( interaction vertices ) sharing it , so that the choice of kinetic functions @xmath17 specifies how the information and therefore the geometric degrees of freedom corresponding to their d ( d-2)-faces are propagated from one vertex of interaction ( fundamental spacetime event ) to another .",
    "we will detail this structure when describing the feynman graphs and the quantum dynamics of the theory . before going on to that ,",
    "let us discuss briefly the classical dynamics of gfts .",
    "what we have is an almost ordinary field theory , in that we can rely on a fixed background metric structure , given by the invariant killing - cartan metric , and the usual splitting between kinetic ( quadratic ) and interaction ( higher order ) term in the action , that will later allow for a straightforward perturbative expansion .",
    "however , the action is also _ non - local _ in that the arguments of the d+1 fields in the interaction term are not all simultaneously identified , but only pairwise ; while this is certainly a complication with respect to usual field theories in minkowski space , on the other hand this pairwise identification implies that , even if the interaction is of order d+1 , in terms of number of fields involved , it is still quadratic in terms of the individual arguments of the fields , which is in some sense a simplification of the usual situation ( e.g. with respect to renormalisation issues ) .",
    "the classical equations of motion following from the above action are ( schematically ) : @xmath19 and are therefore , assuming @xmath17 to be a generic differential operator , of integral - differential type .",
    "no detailed analysis of these equations in any specific gft model nor of their solutions has been carried out to date , but work on this is in progress @xcite . the role and importance of these equation from the point of view of the gft per se",
    "are obvious : they define the classical dynamics of the field theory , they would allow the identification of classical background configurations around which to expand in a semi - classical perturbation expansion , etc .",
    "however , what is their meaning from the point of view of quantum gravity , in light of the geometric interpretation of the field itself as representing a ( d-1)-simplex and of the gft as a _",
    "local simplicial 3rd quantisationof gravity _ ?",
    "the answer is simple if striking : just as the klein - gordon equation represents at the same time the classical equation of motion of a ( free ) scalar field theory and the full quantum dynamics for the corresponding 1st quantised ( free ) theory , in the same way these classical gft equations encode fully the quantum dynamics of the underlying ( simplicial ) canonical quantum gravity theory , i.e. the one in which quantum gravity wave functions are constructed , as for example in loop quantum gravity , by imposing the quantum version of the classical hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "this means that solving the above equations amounts to identifying non - trivial quantum gravity wave functions satisfying * all * the quantum gravity constraints , an important and still unachieved goal of canonical quantum gravity .",
    "we will come back to this canonical interpretation of gfts after having introduced the perturbative expansion of their partition function in feynman diagrams .",
    "another issue that still needs a careful investigation is that of the classical symmetries of the above action and of the resulting equations . it should be obvious , given",
    "the previous discussion , that the symmetries should correspond to the full set of symmetries of the simplicial theory one is quantising .",
    "some of these symmetries , holding regardless of the specific choice of kinetic and interaction operators , are the above - mentioned closuresymmetry imposed on each field : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , encoded in the symmetry property of the kinetic and vertex operators : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the global symmetry of the action under : @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of additional symmetries depends on the specific choice of kinetic and vertex operators , as said , as they would corresponds to specific symmetries of the classical discrete theories being quantised .",
    "the identification of such gft analogues of the classical symmetries of specific discrete theories on spacetime is no easy task , and it is known already in the simpler example of gft formulations of bf theories that there exist characteristic symmetries of the bf theories , i.e. so - called translation or topological symmetries , that can be correctly identified at the level of the gft feynman amplitudes , as identities between amplitudes for different graphs , but do not correspond to the above obvious symmetries of the gft action @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the quantum dynamics of group field theories .",
    "most of the work up to now has focused on the perturbative aspects of this quantum dynamics , and basically the only thing that has been explored to some extent is the expansion in feynman diagrams of the gft partition function and the properties of the resulting feynman amplitudes .",
    "this expansion is given by :    @xmath25}\\,=\\,\\sum_{\\gamma}\\,\\frac{\\lambda^n}{sym[\\gamma]}\\,z(\\gamma),\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the number of interaction vertices in the feynman graph @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] is a symmetry factor for the graph and @xmath28 the corresponding feynman amplitude .",
    "the feynman amplitudes can be constructed easily after identification of the propagator , given by the inverse of the kinetic term in the action , and the vertex amplitude of the theory ; each edge of the feynman graph is made of @xmath29 strands , one for each argument of the field , and each one is then re - routed at the interaction vertex , with the combinatorial structure of an @xmath29-simplex , following the pairing of field arguments in the vertex operator . diagrammatically",
    ":            each strand in an edge of the feynman graph goes through several vertices , coming back where it started , for closed feynman graphs , and therefore identifies a 2-cell ( for open graphs , it may end up on the boundary , identifying an open 2-cell ) .",
    "each feynman graph @xmath26 is then a collection of 2-cells ( faces ) , edges and vertices , i.e. a 2-complex , that , because of the chosen combinatorics for the arguments of the field in the action , is topologically dual to a d - dimensional simplicial complex @xcite .",
    "clearly , the resulting complexes / triangulations can have arbitrary topology , each corresponding to a particular _ scattering process _ of the fundamental building blocks of space , i.e. ( d-1)-simplices .    even if every 2-complex arising as a gft feynman graph can be understood as topologically dual to a d - dimensional triangulation , this would not necessarily be a simplicial _",
    "manifold_. the data in the gft feynman graphs do not constrain the neighbourhoods of simplices of dimensions from ( d-3 ) downwards to be spheres .",
    "this implies that in the general case , the resulting simplicial complex , obtained by gluing d - simplices along their ( d-1)-faces , would correspond to a _ pseudo - manifold _ ,",
    "i.e. to a manifold with _ conical singularities _ @xcite .",
    "a precise set of conditions under which the gft feynman graphs correspond to manifolds is identified and discussed at length in @xcite , both at the level of simplicial complexes and of the corresponding dual 2-complexes , in 2 , 3 and 4 dimensions .",
    "all the relevant conditions can be checked algorithmically on any given feynman graph .",
    "it is not clear , at present , whether and how one can construct suitably constrained gft models satisfying these conditions , i.e. that would generate only manifold - like complexes in their feynman expansion .",
    "each strand carries a field variable , i.e. a group element in configuration space or a representation label in momentum space .",
    "therefore in momentum space each feynman graph is given by a spin foam ( a 2-complex with faces labelled by representation variables ) , and each feynman amplitude ( a complex function of the representation labels , obtained by contracting vertex amplitudes with propagator functions ) by a spin foam model ( see chapter by perez ) :    @xmath30 as in all spin foam models , the representation variables have a geometric interpretation ( edge lengths , areas , etc ) ( see @xcite ) and so each of these feynman amplitudes corresponds to a definition of a sum - over - histories for discrete quantum gravity on the specific triangulation dual to the feynman graph , although the quantum amplitudes for each geometric configuration are not necessarily given by the exponential of a discrete gravity action . for more on the quantum geometry behind spin foam models ( geometric meaning of the variables , form and properties of the amplitudes , etc",
    ", we refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "one can show that the inverse is also true : any local spin foam model can be obtained from a gft perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly important result , since it implies that the gft approach _",
    "subsumes _ the spin foam in its perturbative aspects , while at the same time going beyond it , since there is of course much more in a qft than its perturbative expansion .",
    "the sum over feynman graphs gives then a sum over spin foams ( histories of the spin networks on the boundary in any scattering process considered ) , and equivalently a sum over triangulations , augmented by a sum over algebraic data ( group elements or representations ) with a geometric interpretation , assigned to each triangulation .",
    "this perturbative expansion of the partition function also allows for a perturbative evaluation of expectation values of gft observables , as in ordinary qft .",
    "these are given @xcite by gauge invariant combinations of the basic field operators , that can be constructed in momentum space using spin networks according to the formula : @xmath31 where @xmath32 identifies a spin network functional ( see chapter by thiemann ) for the spin network labelled by a graph @xmath33 with representations @xmath34 associated to its edges and intertwiners @xmath35 associated to its vertices , and @xmath36 are group elements associated to the edges @xmath37 of @xmath33 that meet at the vertex @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the transition amplitude ( probability amplitude for a certain scattering process ) between certain boundary data represented by two spin networks , of arbitrary combinatorial complexity , can be expressed as the expectation value of the field operators having the same combinatorial structure of the two spin networks @xcite .",
    "@xmath38}\\,z(\\gamma)\\ ] ] where the sum involves only 2-complexes ( spin foams ) with boundary given by the two spin networks chosen .",
    "the above perturbative expansion involves therefore two very different types of sums : one is the sum over geometric data ( group elements or representations of @xmath4 ) entering the definition of the feynman amplitudes as the gft analogue of the integral over momenta or positions of usual qft ; the other is the overall sum over feynman graphs ; the last sum includes a sum over all triangulations for a given topology and a sum over all topologies .",
    "both sums are potentially divergent .",
    "first of all the naive definition of the feynman amplitudes implies a certain degree of redundancy , depending on the details of the kinetic and vertex operators chosen , resulting from the symmetries of the defining gft .",
    "this means that a proper gauge fixing of these symmetries , especially those whose group is non - compact , is needed to avoid the associated divergences @xcite . even after gauge fixing",
    ", the sum over geometric data has a potential divergence for every bubbleof the gft feynman diagram , i.e. for every closed surface of it identified by a collection of 2-cells .",
    "this is the gft analogue of loop divergences of usual qft . of course , whether the gft amplitudes are divergent or not depends on the specific model .",
    "for example , while the most natural definition of the group field theory for the barrett - crane spin foam model @xcite , presents indeed bubble divergences , a simple modification of it @xcite , producing a different version of the same model , possesses _ finite _ feynman amplitudes , i.e. it is _ perturbatively finite _ without the need for any regularization . in general",
    "however a regularization and perturbative renormalisation procedure would be needed to make sense of the sums involved in the definition of a given gft .",
    "no systematic study of renormalisation of gfts has been carried out to date .",
    "the importance and need of this study is obvious , given that gfts are presently _ defined _ by their perturbative expansion and that only a proof of renormalisability of such model would ensure that such perturbative expansions make physical sense .",
    "the sum over feynman graphs , on the other hand , is most certainly divergent .",
    "this is not surprising both from the quantum gravity point of view and the qft one .",
    "as said , the sum over feynman graphs gives a sum over _ all _ triangulations for _ all _ topologies , each weighted by a ( discrete ) quantum gravity sum - over - histories .",
    "that such a sum can be defined constructively thanks to the simplicial and qft setting is already quite an achievement , and to ask for it to be finite would be really too much ! also , from the strictly qft perspective , i.e. leaving aside the quantum gravity interpretation of the theory and of its perturbative expansion , it is to be expected that the expansion in feynman graphs of a qft would produce at most an asymptotic series and not a convergent one .",
    "this is the case for all the interesting qfts we know of .",
    "what makes the usual qft perturbative expansion useful in spite of its divergence is the simple fact that it has a clear physical meaning , in particular the fact that one knows what it means to compute a transition amplitude up to a given order . in the gft case",
    "this means , among other things , providing a clear physical interpretation to the coupling constant @xmath39 .",
    "this can be done , actually , in more than one way .",
    "first of all , defining @xmath40 and redefining @xmath41 , we can recast the gft action in the form @xmath42=\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}s_{\\lambda=1}[\\tilde{\\phi}]$ ] .",
    "one can then perform a loop expansion of the gft partition function , that is an expansion in the parameter @xmath43 , instead of a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant .",
    "this gives , for a generic transition amplitude between two boundary states @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a sum over feynman graphs with @xmath2 loops .",
    "the point here is to realise that adding a loop to a given feynman diagram is equivalent @xcite to adding a handle to the simplicial complex dual to it .",
    "this means that the parameter @xmath40 governs the strength of topology changing processes in the gft perturbative expansion .",
    "this interpretation can also be confirmed by analysing the schwinger - dyson equations for a generic gft @xcite .",
    "a different perspective on the physical meaning of @xmath39 is obtained by noticing that @xmath39 weights somehow the sizeof the spacetimes emerging in the gft perturbative expansion , assuming that the number of d - simplices is a measure of the d - volume of spacetime .",
    "then one could define @xmath48 , interpret the feynman amplitude as defining the exponential of an ( effective ) action for gravity @xmath49 and thus rewrite heuristically the gft partition function as : @xmath50 .",
    "now , assuming for @xmath51 a form given by , say , the regge action for pure gravity with no cosmological constant on a triangulation ( dual to @xmath26 ) with fixed edge lengths , then @xmath11 would play the role of a cosmological constant contribution to the gravity action .",
    "indeed this would be exactly the expression for a dynamical triangulations model @xcite with @xmath11 being the bare cosmological constant . while this is just a very heuristic argument and",
    "there is no easy way to make it rigorous for a general gft , it can in fact be made rigorous by considering a tensor model @xcite , a special case of the gft formalism .",
    "this is obtained from the gft for bf theories roughly by constraining the representations of @xmath4 used to be all equal to a given one with dimension @xmath12 ; we will give more details on both tensor models and gfts for bf theories in the following .",
    "for tensor models , the feynman expansion of the partition function is given by @xcite : @xmath52 by redefining @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath4 is the bare newton constant , @xmath55 is the volume of an equilateral d - simplex with edge lengths equal to @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the volume of an equilateral ( d-2)-simplex , the expression above turns into that defining the dynamical triangulations approach @xcite , if the triangulations are restricted to those defining manifolds as opposed to pseudo - manifolds . here , as anticipated , @xmath11 plays the role of the bare cosmological constant . as said , it is not obvious whether and how such interpretation of the gft coupling constant @xmath39 extends to the general gft case , and more work on this is needed",
    ". however , we want to stress that , on the one hand , the two proposed interpretations for @xmath39 are compatible with each other , and that finding a clear link between the two would mean linking the value of the bare , and then of the renormalised , cosmological constant to the presence of spatial topology change . this would be the realisation in a more rigorous context of an old idea @xcite that was indeed among the first motivations for developing a 3rd quantisationformalism for quantum gravity .    before going on to discuss some specific gft models",
    ", we would like to remark once more on the connection between gft and canonical quantum gravity , and to point out to one important recent proposal concerning this relation .",
    "as already mentioned , the classical gft equations of motion are interpreted as encoding the full quantum dynamics of the corresponding 1st quantised theory ; this is a simplicial quantum gravity theory whose kinematical quantum states are labelled by d - valent spin networks for the group @xmath4 .",
    "if the spin foams describing the histories of such states were to be restricted to those corresponding to triangulation of trivial spacetime topology , then a sum over such histories weighted by an appropriate amplitude would be a possible definition of the canonical inner product for a simplicial version of loop quantum gravity based on the group @xmath4 , if the 2-point function so defined is positive semi - definite as it should .",
    "in other words such sum - over - histories would define implicitly a projection onto physical quantum states of gravity , thus fully encoding the dynamics of the theory usually given in terms of an hamiltonian constraint operator ( see chapters by thiemann and perez ) .",
    "now , the gft formalism allows a natural definition of such sum , that involves , as expected , only the classical information encoded in the gft action . in fact , one could consider the restriction of the gft perturbative expansion given above to _ tree level _ , for given boundary spin network observables,@xcite :    @xmath58}\\,z(\\gamma).\\ ] ]    this is the gft definition of the canonical inner product , i.e. of the matrix elements of the projector operator @xcite , _ for feynman amplitudes that are real and positive _ , as for example those of the bf or barrett - crane models .",
    "the definition is well posed , because at tree level every single amplitude @xmath28 is finite whatever the model considered due to the absence of infinite summation ( unless it presents divergences at specific values of the configuration / momentum variables ) .",
    "moreover , it possesses all the properties one expects from a canonical inner product : 1 ) it involves a sum over feynman graphs , and therefore triangulations , with the cylindrical topology @xmath59 $ ] , for closed spin networks @xmath60 associated with the two boundaries , as it is easy to verify ; 2 ) it is real and positive , as said , but not strictly positive ; it has a non - trivial kernel that can be shown @xcite to include all solutions of the classical gft equations of motion , as expected .",
    "this means that the physical hilbert space for canonical spin network states can be constructed , using the gns construction , from the kinematical hilbert space of all spin network states by modding out those states belonging to the kernel of the above inner product .",
    "on the one hand this represent a concrete ( and the first ) proposal for completing the definition of a loop formulation of quantum gravity , that can now be put to test , so the possible end of a long quest started more than 15 years ago , and thus a proof of the usefulness of gft ideas and techniques if only with respect to the canonical / hamiltonian quantum gravity program . on the other hand , and , in our opinion , most importantly , it makes clear that the gft formalism contains and therefore can achieve much more than any canonical quantum theory of gravity , given that the last is fully contained in the very small subset of the former corresponding to the classicallevel only . within the gft formalism",
    ", we can go beyond this investigating , for example , the full quantum structure , topology change , quantum gravity 2-point functions ( in superspace ) that are * not * the canonical inner product @xcite , etc .",
    "let us now discuss some specific gft models .",
    "the easiest example is the straightforward generalisation of matrix models for 2d quantum gravity to a gft @xcite , given by the action : @xmath61=\\int_g dg_1dg_2 \\frac{1}{2}\\phi(g_1,g_2)\\phi(g_1,g_2 ) + \\frac{\\lambda}{3!}\\int dg_1dg_2dg_3\\phi(g_1,g_2)\\phi(g_1,g_3)\\phi(g_2,g_3)\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a generic compact group , say @xmath62 , and the symmetries mentioned above are imposed on the field @xmath63 implying , in this case : @xmath64 .",
    "the relation with matrix models is apparent in momentum space , expanding the field in representations @xmath65 of @xmath4 to give :    @xmath61=\\sum_j \\textit{dim}(j ) \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}tr{(\\tilde{\\phi}_j^2 ) } + \\frac{\\lambda}{3!}tr(\\tilde{\\phi}_j^3)\\right)\\ ] ]    where the field modes @xmath66 are indeed matrices with dimension @xmath67 , so that the action is given by a sum of matrix models actions for increasing dimensions .",
    "alternatively , one can see the above as the action for a single matrix model in which the dimension of the matrices has been turned from a parameter into a dynamical variable .",
    "the feynman amplitudes for such a theory are given by @xmath68 and shows that the gft above gives a quantisation of bf theory ( with gauge group @xmath4 ) on a closed triangulated surface , dual to @xmath26 , of genus @xmath69 , augmented by a sum over all such surfaces defined as a feynman expansion@xcite .",
    "a quantisation of 2d gravity along the same lines would use an @xmath70 connection ( and therefore @xmath71 ) and a restriction on the representations summed over to single one , together with additional data encoding bundle information in the gft action , see @xcite .",
    "the extension to higher dimensions can proceed in two ways .",
    "the first attempt at this was done in @xcite where the first tensor modelwas introduced , with action :    @xmath61=\\sum_{\\alpha_{i}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\phi_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3}\\phi_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 } + \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3}\\phi_{\\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\alpha_5}\\phi_{\\alpha_5\\alpha_2\\alpha_6}\\phi_{\\alpha_6\\alpha_4\\alpha_1}\\right ) \\label{eq : tensor},\\ ] ]    for a @xmath72 tensor @xmath63 .",
    "this model generates 3-dimensional simplicial complexes in its feynman expansion , that include @xcite both manifold- and pseudo - manifold - like configurations .",
    "it is not however a gft until group structure is added .",
    "this is done again as a straightforward generalisation of the above model for the 2d case .",
    "in fact the following choice of kinetic and vertex term in the generic action [ eq : action ] :    @xmath73 where the integrals impose the gauge invariance under the action of @xmath4 , gives the gft quantisation of bf theories , for gauge group @xmath4 , in any dimension @xcite .",
    "in particular , in 3 dimensions , the choice of @xmath74 or @xmath75 provides a quantisation of 3d gravity in the euclidean and minkowskian signatures , respectively , and the so - called ponzano - regge spin foam model , as evaluation of the gft feynman amplitudes ( see also @xcite for more details on this gft , first proposed by boulatov @xcite ) , while the choice of the quantum group @xmath76 gives the turaev - viro topological invariant .",
    "for the @xmath62 case , the action is then : @xmath77=\\prod_i \\int_{su(2 ) } \\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3)+ \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\prod_{i=1}^{6}\\int_{su(2)}dg_i \\;\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\phi(g_3,g_4,g_5)\\phi(g_5,g_2,g_6)\\phi(g_6,g_4,g_1 ) .",

    ", we mention only one result that is of interest for the general issue of gft renormalisation .",
    "this is the proof @xcite that a simple modification of the gft above gives a model whose perturbative expansion is borel summable",
    ". the modification amounts to adding another vertex term of the same order to the original one , to give :    @xmath78.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the new term corresponds simply to a slightly different recoupling of the group / representation variables at each vertex of interaction , geometrically to the only other possible way of gluing 4 triangles to form a closed surface .",
    "this borel - summability is interesting for more than one reason : 1 ) it shows that it _ is _ possible to control the sum over triangulations of all topologies appearing in the gft perturbative expansion , despite the factorial growth in their number with the number of 3-simplices forming them ; whether the sum is summable or not , then , depends clearly only on the amplitude weighting them ; 2 ) even if the above modification of the boulatov gft model has no clear physical interpretation yet from the quantum gravity point of view , e.g. in terms of gravity coupled to some sort of matter , it is indeed a very mild modification , and most importantly one that one would expect to be forced upon us by renormalisation group - type of argument , that usually require us to include in the action of our field theory all possible terms that are compatible with the symmetries .    still in the 3d case , it is easy to check that a gft action with the same combinatorial structure of the boulatov model , but for a real field defined on the homogeneous space @xmath79 ( in turn obtained choosing @xmath74 and then averaging over the subgroup @xmath80 in each argument of the field @xcite ) , and with the invariance under the global @xmath81 action in each field having been dropped , gives a generalisation of the tensor model [ eq : tensor ] analogous to the gft generalisation of matrix models previously described .",
    "in fact the action for this model , in momentum space , is :    @xmath61=\\sum_{j_i,\\alpha_{i}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\phi^{j_1j_2j_3}_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3}\\phi^{j_1j_2j_3}_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 } + \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\sum_{j_i,\\alpha_i}\\phi^{j_1j_2j_3}_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3}\\phi^{j_3j_4j_5}_{\\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\alpha_5}\\phi^{j_5j_2j_6}_{\\alpha_5\\alpha_2\\alpha_6}\\phi^{j_6j_4j_1}_{\\alpha_6\\alpha_4\\alpha_1}\\right)\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath82 run over a basis of vectors in the representation space @xmath83 , and its partition function is : @xmath84 , with @xmath85 being th faces of the 2-complex / feynman graph , which is divergent and has to be regularised .",
    "there are three ways of doing it , and , by doing this , reducing the partition function to that of a tensor model : 1 ) simply dropping the sum over the representations @xmath86 by fixing them to equal a given @xmath8 ; 2 ) placing a cut - off on the sum by restricting @xmath87 , obtaining @xmath88^{n_f(\\gamma)}$ ] ; 3 ) equivalently , but more elegantly , by defining the model not on @xmath89 but on the non - commutative 2-sphere @xmath90 , which also carries a representation of @xmath62 but implies a bounded decomposition in spherical harmonics ( labelled by @xmath91 ) , thus giving the same result for the partition function .",
    "we recognise in the above result the partition function for the tensor model [ eq : tensor ] and for a dynamical triangulations model @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the situation in the 4d case . here",
    "gft model building has followed the development of spin foam models for 4d quantum gravity . the guiding idea in the spin foam setting",
    "( see chapter by perez ) has been the fact that _ classical _ gravity can be written @xcite as a constrained version of a bf theory for the lorentz group ; the construction of the appropriate spin foam model then required @xcite first a description of simplicial geometry in terms of bivectors ( discretion of the @xmath92 field of the bf theory ) subject to the discrete analogue of the continuum constraints @xcite , and then finding the algebraic translation of these at the quantum level as constraints on the representations labelling the spin foam faces .",
    "the barrett - crane spin foam models obtained as a result of this amount roughly to a restriction of spin foam models for bf theories to involve so - called _ simple _ representations only of the lorentz group ( @xmath93 or @xmath94 , or the corresponding double covering , depending on the signature wanted for spacetime ) @xcite . the same restriction can be imposed at the gft level , starting from the gft describing 4d bf theory , by projecting down the arguments of the field from @xmath95 ( @xmath94 ) to the homogeneous space @xmath96 ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 in the lorentzian case ) , exploiting the fact that only simple representations of @xmath4 appear in the harmonic decomposition of functions on these spaces . the gft action is then defined @xcite ( we deal explicitly only with the riemannian case for simplicity ) as :    @xmath99=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\prod_i \\int_{so(4 ) } dg_i\\right )   p_gp_h\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4)p_gp_h\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4 ) + } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{\\lambda}{5!}\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{10}\\int_{so(4)}dg_i\\right )   \\left [   p_gp_h\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4)p_gp_h\\phi(g_4,g_5,g_6,g_7)p_gp_h\\phi(g_7,g_8,g_3,g_9)\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & \\left.\\right .",
    "& \\left.\\hspace{4cm}p_gp_h\\phi(g_9,g_5,g_2,g_{10})p_gp_h\\phi(g_{10},g_8,g_6,g_1)\\right]\\;\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the projection @xmath100 from the group to the homogeneous space imposes the wanted constraints on the representations , in momentum space , and the projection @xmath101 ensures that gauge invariance is maintained .",
    "different variations of this model can be constructed @xcite by inserting the two projectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the action in different combinations .",
    "however , the symmetries of the resulting models remain the same , and the corresponding feynman amplitudes have the structure :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the measure for the representation @xmath106 , labelling the faces of the 2-complex / feynman graph , entering the harmonic decomposition of the delta function on the group , and the function @xmath107 , depending on the ten representations labelling the ten faces of @xmath26 incident to the same vertex @xmath108 is the so - called barrett - crane vertex @xcite ; the exact form of the edge amplitude @xmath109 , on the other hand , depend on the version of the specific variation of the above action being considered .",
    "the above feynman amplitudes , modulo the exact form of the edge amplitudes , can be obtained and justified in various ways , e.g. starting from a discretisation of classical bf theory and a subsequent imposition of the constraints @xcite , and in particular there is a good consensus on the validity of the barrett - crane construction for the vertex amplitude . as a hint that at least _ some _ of the properties of gravity we want are correctly encoded in the above feynman amplitudes , we cite the fact that there exists at least a sector of the geometric configurations summed over where an explicit connection with classical discrete gravity can be exhibited .",
    "in fact @xcite , for non - degenerate configurations ( i.e. those corresponding to non - degenerate simplicial geometries ) the asymptotic limit of the barrett - crane amplitude @xmath110 is proportional to the cosine of the regge action for simplicial gravity , i.e. the correct discretion of the einstein - hilbert action for continuum general relativity .",
    "it is therefore very close to the form one would have expected for the amplitudes in a sum - over - histories formulation of quantum gravity on a given simplicial manifold .",
    "all the above models ( for bf theory and quantum gravity ) in both 2 , 3 and 4 dimensions share the following general properties : 1 ) their feynman amplitudes are real ; 2 ) they do not depend on the orientation chosen for the complexes , or to put it differently , no unique orientation for the ( various elements of the ) triangulation dual to any feynman graph can be reconstructed from the amplitude associated to it ; 3 ) in quantum gravity models , the asymptotic limit of the vertex amplitude gives ( in the non - degenerate sector ) the _ cosine _ of the regge action instead of the exponential of it .",
    "these properties suggest the interpretation @xcite of the corresponding models as defining the quantum gravity analogue of the hadamard 2-point function for a relativistic particle ( anti - commutator of field operators in qft ) , or , more appropriately in our field theory context , as defining a qft picture for quantum gravity with hadamard propagators used everywhere in the internal linesof the graphs , instead of the usual feynman propagators . also , these are the wanted properties if our aim is to define , through a gft , the inner product of a canonical / hamiltonian theory of quantum gravity based on spin networks , as we have discussed , i.e. we want to impose the dynamics encoded in a hamiltonian constraint using covariant methods . in other words ,",
    "the feynman amplitudes of these gft models would correspond not to a simplicial version of the path integral formalism for quantum gravity , but to the symmetrized version of the same over opposite spacetime orientations , that indeed gives a path integral definition of solutions of the hamiltonian constraint operator of canonical quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , there are several reasons why one may want to go beyond this type of structure .",
    "we cite three of them .",
    "1 ) from a field theoretic perspective applied to quantum gravity , i.e. from the point of view of a field theory on a simplicial superspace we are advocating here , the most natural object one would expect a gft to define with its 2-point functions is not a canonical inner product , solution of the hamiltonian constraint , but a green function for it . this is what happens in ordinary qft , for the free theory , and in the formal context of continuum 3rd quantisation for quantum gravity . in the last case , in fact , the feynman amplitudes of the theory , in absence of spatial topology change , correspond to the usual path integral formulation of quantum gravity for given boundary wave functions , with amplitude given by the exponential of the gr action @xcite , which is a green function for the hamiltonian constraint , and not a solution of the same , in each of its arguments .",
    "2 ) the orientation of the gft 2-complexes can be given , for lorentzian models , a _ causal _",
    "interpretation @xcite , if one also interprets the vertices of the same as fundamental spacetime events , and thus the orientation independence of the spin foam amplitudes associated to the usual models implies that these models define _ a - causal _ transition amplitudes for quantum gravity . again , this is consistent with the field - theoretic interpretation of the same amplitudes given above and with the wish to construct the canonical inner product , but it also suggest that one should be able to construct other types of models defining _ causal _ quantum gravity transition amplitudes @xcite instead and thus different types of gfts .",
    "3 ) if there is , as we have seen , a clear interpretation from the perspective of canonical quantum gravity for the amplitudes defined by the gft in the case of trivial spacetime topology ( i.e. no spatial topology change ) , this occurs in a very limited subsector of the theory , and no clear meaning can be given in the same perspective to the gft amplitudes for feynman graphs beyond the tree level , when spatial topology change is present , and thus a canonical / hamiltonian formalism is not well - defined .",
    "for all these reasons one would like to be have a more general class of gft models that do depend on the orientation of the gft feynman graphs , that can be interpreted consistently as analogues of causal transition amplitudes of qft , that are in more direct contact with usual path integral formulations of ( simplicial ) gravity , and that reduce to the above type of models ( and corresponding amplitudes ) when suitably restricted .",
    "this was achieved in @xcite . here a generalised version of the gft formalism was defined , for a field @xmath111 , with action ( in the 4d riemannian case ) : @xmath112\\phi^{\\mu\\alpha}(g_i , s_i)\\right\\ } + } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\mu}\\sum_{\\alpha_i }    \\frac{\\lambda_{\\{\\alpha_i,\\mu\\}}}{5!}\\prod_{i\\neq    j=1}^{5}\\int_g dg_{ij}\\int_\\mathbb{r}ds_{ij }    \\left\\ { p_h\\phi^{\\mu\\alpha_1}(g_{1j},s_{1j } ) p_h\\phi^{\\mu\\alpha_2}(g_{2j},s_{2j } ) ........ \\right .",

    "the field is assumed invariant under the diagonal action of @xmath4 , as in the models discussed above .",
    "the form of the kinetic operator and the use of the evolution kernels with proper time parameter @xmath122 , plus the restriction on its range ( through the theta functions ) , just as in the definition of the feynman propagator of a relativistic particle , in the vertex term , impose a non - trivial dependence on the orientation data in fully covariant way .",
    "the resulting feynman amplitudes @xcite have all the properties wanted , being complex and orientation - dependent , and have the natural interpretation as analogues of feynman transition amplitudes for quantum gravity @xcite . also , when expressed in momentum space , but only for the variables @xmath123 , whose conjugate variables are labelled suggestively as _ variable masses _",
    "@xmath124 , the amplitude for each vertex is given by : @xmath125 with @xmath126 interpreted as the area of the triangle dual to the face @xmath127 , and the angle @xmath128 measuring the holonomy around the portion of the face dual to the same triangle inside the 4-simplex dual to @xmath108 ; thus this amplitude is @xcite of the form of the exponential of the regge action in 1st order formalism , times an appropriate measure factor . it remains to be proven that this form still holds , in these variables , for the amplitude associated to the whole feynman graph @xcite .",
    "other models in the same class , i.e. with the same type of fields and the same symmetries , can be defined , and share similar properties @xcite .    as desired",
    ", the generalised gft model reduces to the usual ones ( i.e. to the barrett - crane model , in this case ) of one drops the @xmath129s from the vertex function in the action , or equivalently averages over different orientation data in the same term , _ and _ goes to the _ static - ultra - local _ limit of the kinetic term , i.e. replaces the derivative operators with simple delta functions identifying pairwise the arguments of the two fields . what we have",
    ", then , is truly a generalisation of the usual formalism , that , moreover , gives gfts a structure even more similar to ordinary qfts , thanks to the presence of derivatives in the action , and may thus possibly simplify their future analysis and development .",
    "other types of gfts have been constructed in the literature , ranging from a boulatov - like model for 3d gravity based on the quantum group @xmath130 @xcite , with links to models of 3d quantum gravity coupled to matter , that we are going to discuss below , to a modified version @xcite of the gfts for the barrett - crane models , with a tunable extra coupling among the 4-simplices and a possible use in the renormalisation of spin foam models .",
    "for all these , and others @xcite , we refer to the literature .",
    "we want instead to discuss now , briefly , the coupling of matter fields to quantum gravity in the group field theory context .",
    "this has been sketched in the 4-dimensional case in @xcite , but has been described in full details only in the 3d case in @xcite , with an earlier model , based on similar ideas but covering only the spinless case , having been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the idea followed in this work is to define a gft that would treat quantaof gravity and of matter on equal footing and generate , in perturbative expansion , a sum over feynman diagrams of gravity , i.e. spin foam 2-complexes / triangulations , and feynman diagrams of any given matter field theory , with the latter suitably topologically embedded in the former .",
    "the degrees of freedom of matter fields should also be suitably coupled to those of geometry to reproduce , at the level of the spin foam amplitudes , the correct dynamical interaction of gravity and matter .",
    "the spin foam amplitudes describing this coupling in 3d , were introduced and studied in @xcite , and provided the key insight needed to devise an appropriate gft reproducing them .",
    "the kinematical structure of the new gft is given @xcite by _ two _ different types of fields : one is the usual @xmath63 of the boulatov theory discussed above , and represents a triangle with no particle present , the other is a new field @xmath131 , on which we impose a global @xmath62 symmetry under the simultaneous right shift of its 4 arguments , and represents a tetrahedron with a single particle of spin @xmath122 located at one of its vertices , whose degrees of freedom are encoded in the group variable @xmath132 .",

    ", the first type of field corresponds to a simple pure gravity 3-valent spin network vertex , that will give closed spin network states when suitably contracted with other vertices through its open links ; the second gives a 4-valent vertex with one extra open link labelled by the particle degrees of freedom ; the contraction of such vertices with both pure gravity vertices and other 4-valent ones produces _ open _ spin networks , that are at the same time quantum gravity states and multi - particle states .",
    "the gft should then describe dynamically the creation / annihilation of these two types of fundamental structures , producing both a ( simplicial ) spacetime and a matter feynman graph for a particle species with spin @xmath122 embedded in it .",

    ". here even the pure propagation of matter degrees of freedom has been encoded in one of the gft interaction terms because it involves an interaction with the geometric degrees of freedom , but it could be as well encoded in one of the gft kinetic terms . for a more extended discussion of this action and for a clarifying graphical representation of the various terms in it , and of the resulting feynman graphs for gravity and matter , we refer to @xcite .",
    "as anticipated , the feynman amplitudes of this gft are given by the coupled ponzano - regge spin foam model for gravity coupled to spinning particles studied in @xcite , so we do not need to reproduce them here . these can be understood as discrete path integrals for quantum gravity on a given spacetime triangulation , coupled to particles whose trajectories are characterised by the particle feynman graph embedded in the same triangulation .",

    "the straightforward extension of the above gft model to 4d gives a fully non - perturbative quantum description , in a discrete setting , of topological gravity ( bf theory ) coupled to topological strings , producing in perturbation expansion a sum over both simplicial spacetimes and discrete string worldsheets embedded in them @xcite , and with kinematical and dynamical structures consistent with the canonical analysis of such system performed in @xcite .",
    "yet another direction towards the understanding of quantum gravity coupled to matter in 4d is the development of gft model for gravity coupled to yang - mills theories , following earlier results obtained in the spin foam setting @xcite , that would produce , again in its perturbative expansion , a sum over all simplicial complexes with amplitudes given by the spin foam analogue of a path integral for gravity coupled to gauge theory , in the form of a lattice gauge theory on a random simplicial lattice with dynamical geometry @xcite .",
    "we conclude this discussion of matter - gravity coupling in the gft language by mentioning a rather speculative but highly intriguing idea put forward in @xcite .",
    "the suggestion is that the gfts for pure gravity of the type outlined above already contain all the right matter degrees of freedom , and therefore there is no need to modify them by explicitly coupling different types of data and extending the field content of the models : the idea is that the conical singularities arising in the gft perturbative expansion , and characterising the triangulations not satisfying manifold - like conditions at their vertices @xcite , could be re - expressed as matter degrees of freedom , moreover possessing apparently the right type of ( internal ) structure for reproducing the matter content of the standard model @xcite .",
    "where do group field theories stand with respect to other approaches to quantum gravity ?",
    "we have already mentioned , albeit briefly , several links with other types of formalisms , and we would like to recapitulate them here . in doing",
    "so we sketch a ( rather speculative at present ) broader picture that sees gfts as a _ generalised formalism for quantum gravity _ , in which other discrete and continuum approaches can be subsumed .",
    "we have already shown the way spin foam models arise universally as feynman amplitudes for gfts , so we do nt need to stress again how on the one hand the gft approach can reproduce ( at least in principle ) any result obtained in the spin foam context , in its perturbative expansion around the gft vacuum , while on the other hand providing much more than that in its , still unexplored , non - perturbative properties .    in the perspective on gfts we proposed , they realise a * local simplicial 3rd quantization of gravity * , with its feynman amplitudes interpreted as discrete path integrals for gravity on a given simplicial complex , and a sum over simplicial spacetimes of all topologies realised as a perturbative sum over feynman graphs .",
    "the natural question is then what is the exact relationship with the more traditional path integral quantisations of simplicial gravity : quantum regge calculus ( see chapter by williams ) and dynamical triangulations ( see chapter by ambjorn et al . ) .",
    "let us consider the first of the above .",
    "this uses a fixed triangulation of spacetime for defining its quantum amplitudes , and thus should be reproduced at the level of the gft feynman amplitudes for given feynman graph .",
    "the geometric interpretation of the gft variables ( group representations , group elements , etc ) appearing in the various models , is well understood @xcite and was discussed above . in general",
    "one would expect a generic spin foam model for gravity to give a path integral quantization of discrete gravity in 1st order formalism , i.e. treating on equal footing the ( d-2)-volumes and the corresponding dihedral angles ( equivalently , appropriate parallel transports of a lorentz connection ) as fundamental variables , as opposed to the 2nd order formulation of traditional regge calculus in terms of edge lengths ; but this may be consider a somewhat minor difference , even if its consequences deserve to be better understood . the main issue that needs to be solved in order to establish a clear link with the quantum regge calculus approach has to do with the fact that the quantum amplitudes weighting histories of the gravitational field are given , in the latter approach , by the exponential of the regge action for discrete gravity , and in the most studied spin foam models the connection between the quantum amplitudes and the regge action is clear only in a particular regime and even there it is rather involved , as we have discussed .",
    "however , it seems plausible that the new generalised models of @xcite , or a suitably modification of the same , can indeed give amplitudes with the same structure as in quantum regge calculus , with a measure being uniquely determined by the choice of gft action , thus making the connection with discrete gravity clear and at the same time subsuming the quantum regge calculus approach within the gft formalism , where it would arise for a specific type of models , in the perturbative sector only .",
    "the same type of amplitudes is needed also to establish a solid link with the dynamical triangulations approach , that in fact use again the exponential of the regge action for weighting this time not the set of geometric data assigned to a single triangulation , but the combinatorial structure of the triangulation itself , which is treated as the only true dynamical variable within a sum over all possible triangulations of a given topology .",
    "once the right type of amplitudes is obtained , the dynamical traingulations approach would once more arise as a subsector of the gft formalism , if one could find the right way of trivialising the extra structure associated to each triangulation , thus dropping the now redundant sum over geometric data . of course ,",
    "more work would be needed then to impose the extra conditions ( fixed slicing structure , absence of baby universe nucleation , etc ) that seem to be needed in the modern version of the approach ( see chapter by ambjorn et al . ) to have the right type of continuum limit .",
    "work on this is in progress @xcite .    that a covariant path integral quantisation can be understood as being more general than the corresponding canonical / hamiltonian one , and that this is even more true when a sum over topologies is implemented through some sort of 3rd quantisation , is well known . in the gft framework ,",
    "one expects then to be able to reproduce the setting and results of a canonical quantum gravity based on the same type of variables ( group elements , interpreted as holonomies of a gravitational connection , or group representations , interpreted as ( d-2)-volumes conjugate to them ) , and of quantum gravity states ( spin networks ) : loop quantum gravity .",
    "how this can indeed be realised @xcite , in a way that goes even beyond the present results of the lqg approach , has been shown above , when discussing the gft definition of the canonical inner product .",
    "the main differences between the particular version of the lqg formalism that the gft approach reproduces , and the traditional one ( see chapter by thiemann ) , are two : 1 ) the spin networks appearing as boundary states or observables in the gft framework are inherently adapted to a simplicial context in that they are always d - valent in d spacetime dimensions , being dual to appropriate ( d-1)-triangulations , while the spin networks arising in the _ continuum _ loop quantum gravity approach are of arbitrary valence ; 2 ) the group used to label these states and their quantum evolution amplitudes in the gft case is the lorentz group of the corresponding dimension , which means , in dimension 4 and minkowskian signature , the non - compact group @xmath94 , while lqg uses @xmath62 spin networks also in this context .",
    "the first of these differences is not so crucial , since on the one hand any higher valent spin network in lqg can be decomposed into lower - valent ones , and on the other hand any coarse graining procedure to be implemented to approximate simplicial ( boundary ) structures with continuum ones , and applied to the gft boundary states or to gft observables , would likely remove any restriction on the valence .",
    "the second difference is more troubleful , and establishing an explicit connection between the fully covariant gft spin network structures and the @xmath62-based lqg ones is no easy task .",
    "however , lots of work has already been done on this issue @xcite ( see chapter by livine ) and can be the starting point for 1 ) establishing a well - defined canonical formalism from the gft structures first , and then 2 ) linking ( more appropriately , reducing , probably through some sort of gauge fixing ) this formalism to that of traditional lqg .",
    "a fourth approach that can be linked to the gft one is the causal set approach ( see chapter by henson ) .",
    "recent work on spin foam models and gft @xcite has shown how the gft feynman amplitudes can be written in the form of models for causal evolution of spin networks @xcite , by a correct implementation of causality requirements . a key step in doing",
    "this is the causal interpretation , in the lorentzian context , of the gft feynman graph , this being _ directed graph _",
    "i.e. a graph with directionsor arrows labelling its edges thus endowed with an orientation . in this interpretation ,",
    "the vertices of the graph , i.e. the elementary gft interactions , dual to d - simplices , are the fundamental spacetime events , and the links of the graph each connecting two such vertices , dual to ( d-1)-simplices and corresponding to elementary propagation of degrees of freedom in the gfts , represent the fundamental causal relations between spacetime events .",
    "a directed graph is very close to a causal set , from which it differs for just one , albeit important , property : it possibly includes closed loops of arrows .",
    "this , from the point of view of causal set theory , is a violation of causality , the microscopic discrete equivalent of a closed timelike loop in general relativity , forbidden in the basic axioms defining the approach .",
    "no such restriction is imposed , a priori , on the corresponding gft structures .",
    "there are several possible attitudes towards this issue from the gft perspective : 1 ) it is possible that such configurations , even though they are present in the set of allowed configurations , are not relevant for the continuum approximation of them , i.e. they disappear or give a negligible contribution to the sum under the appropriate coarse graining procedure ; 2 ) in the specific gft models that will turn out to be of most interest for quantum gravity , feynman graphs possessing such closed timelike loopsmay end up being assigned quantum amplitudes that strongly suppress them compared to other configurations ; 3 ) one may be able to give a purely field - theoretic interpretation of such loops in the gft context and then identify some sort of superselection rulesthat could eventually be imposed on the gft perturbative expansion to suppress them ; 4 ) finally , one may decide that there is no fundamental reason to ban such configuration from the admissible ones and rather find the way to interpret them physically and study their observable consequences .",
    "only further work will tell . finally , one more difference with the causal set framework is worth mentioning : due again to the simplicial setting in which they are realised , the gft feynman graphs have vertices of finite and fixed valence depending on the spacetime dimension , while the causal set vertices have no restriction on their valence .",
    "once more , it is well possible that one has to welcome such restriction because it results in may be interpreted as one more sign of a fundamental spacetime discreteness , that may be attractive from both philosophical and physical reasons ; at the same time , it is possible that such restriction on valence will be removed automatically and necessarily in the study of the continuum approximation of such discrete substratum for spacetime , by means of coarse graining procedures ( as mentioned above regarding gft kinematical states ) or of renormalisation group arguments ( e.g. inclusion of more types of interaction terms in the gft action ) .",
    "the gft formalism is therefore able to encompass several other approaches to quantum gravity , each carrying its own set of ideas and techniques ; strengthening the links with these other approaches will be , in our opinion , of great importance for both developing further the gft framework itself , and also for making progress on the various open issues that such other approaches still have to face , thanks to their embeddinginto a different context , that naturally brings in a fresh new perspective on the same open issues .",
    "let us summarise .",
    "the group field theory approach aims to describe the dynamics of both spacetime geometry and topology down to the planck scale , in a background independent and non - perturbative way ( even if at present almost only the perturbation expansion around the complete vacuumis well understood ) , using a field - theoretic formalism .",
    "in essence , as discussed , a group field theory is a field theory over a group manifold , as for the mathematical formulation , and at the same time a field theory over a simplicial superspace ( space of geometries ) , as for the physical interpretation .",
    "thanks to the discrete description of geometry that the simplicial setting allows for , it corresponds to a _ local _",
    "3rd quantisation of gravity , in which the quantabeing created and annihilated in the quantum evolution are not universes , as in the traditional approach , but appropriately defined chunks of space .",
    "what is particularly attractive , in our opinion , about this approach is the combination of _ orthodoxy _ in the mathematical language and technology used and of _ radicalness _ in the ideas that this language expresses . on the one hand , in fact , gfts are almost ordinary field theories , defined on a group manifold with fixed metric and topology , and thus background dependent , speaking from a purely formal point of view , and using the ordinary language of fields and actions , of feynman graphs , propagators and vertices of interaction , gauge symmetries , etc .",
    "this means that gfts allow , at least in principle , to tackle any of the traditional questions in quantum gravity using techniques and ideas from qft , thus making use of the vast body of knowledge and methods developed in a background dependent context that appeared for long time not directly applicable to quantum gravity research . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall picture of spacetime and of gravity that this approach is based on , despite the traditional nature of the language used to express it , is definitely radical and suggests the following .",
    "there exist fundamental building blocks or atoms of space , which can be combined in all sorts of ways and can give rise to all sorts of geometry and topology of space . at the perturbative level spacetime is the ( virtual ) history of creation / annihilation of these fundamental atoms ; it has no _ real _ existence , at least no more real existence in itself than each of the infinite possible interaction processes corresponding to individual feynman graphs in any field theory ; the interaction / evolution of these building blocks does not leave neither the geometry nor the topology of space fixed , but treats them on almost equal footing as dynamically evolving ; the description of this evolution is necessarily background independent ( from the point of view of spacetime ) because spacetime itself is built from the bottom up and all of spacetime information has to be reconstructed from the information carried by the atomsand thus by the feynman graphs . at the non - perturbative level , for what we can see given the present status of the subject , spacetime is simply not there , given that the non - perturbative properties of quantum gravity would be encoded necessarily either in the gft action , and in the resulting equations of motion , or in the gft partition function , and the related correlation functions , to be studied non - perturbatively , neither of which need any notion of spacetime to be defined or analysed ( through instantonic calculations , or renormalisation group methods , or the like ) .",
    "spacetime information is thus necessarily encoded in structures that do not use _ per se _ a notion of spacetime .",
    "finally , there would be a _",
    "fundamental discreteness _ of spacetime and a key role played by _ causality _ , in the pre - geometric sense of _ ordering _ related to the notion of orientation ( so that it would probably be better to talk about pre - causality ) .",
    "many of these ideas had been of course put forward several times in the past , and occur in more than one other approach to quantum gravity , but the gft formalism brings all of them together within a unique framework and , as said , expresses them in a rather conventional and powerful language ; moreover , thanks to the possibility ( yet to be realised ) of subsuming many other approaches within the gft one , all the ideas and techniques developed and the results obtained within these other approaches will maybe find a new role and application in the gft setting .",
    "let us sketch also some examples of how traditional field theoretic methods can be used to tackle within a radically new perspective some crucial open issue in quantum gravity research .",
    "we have already mentioned several of these examples : the long - standing problem of solving the hamiltonian constraint equation of canonical quantum gravity can be identified with the task of solving the classical gft equations of motion , and how the other long - standing issue of defining a canonical inner product for quantum gravity states is turned into the task of analysing the tree level truncation of the ( perturbative expansion of the ) appropriate gft .",
    "also , the perturbation theory around such quantum gravity states would be governed , according to the above results , by the approximation of the gft partition function around its classical solutions , and this suggests a new strategy for investigating the existence of gravitons ( propagating degrees of freedom ) in specific gft / spin foam models .",
    "the most outstanding open issue that most of the discrete non - perturbative approaches to quantum gravity still face is however that of the continuum approximation .",
    "this problem has been formulated and tackled in a variety of ways , depending on the particular approach to quantum gravity under scrutiny .",
    "obviously , given the role that formalisms like dynamical triangulations , quantum regge calculus , causal sets or loop quantum gravity can play within the group field theory framework , all the various techniques developed for them can be adapted to the gfts .",
    "however , the field theory language that is at the forefront of the gft approach suggests once more new perspectives .",
    "let us sketch them briefly .",
    "the continuum approximation issue can be seen as the search for the answer to two different types of question .",
    "a ) what is the best procedure to approximate a discrete spacetime , e.g. a simplicial complex , with a continuum manifold , and to obtain some effective quantum amplitude for each geometric configuration from the underlying fundamental discrete model ? in the context of spin foam models ,",
    "the most directly linked with the gft approach , this amounts to devising a background independent procedure for coarse grainingthe spin foam 2-complexes and the corresponding amplitudes @xcite to obtain a smooth approximation of the same .",
    "b ) if a continuum spacetime or space are nothing else than some sort of condensateof fundamentally discrete objects , as in some emergent gravityapproaches ( see chapter by dreyer ) , and as suggested by condensed matter analog models of gravity @xcite , what are these fundamental constituents ? what are their properties",
    "? what kind of ( necessarily background independent ) model can describe them and the whole process of condensation ?",
    "what are the effective hydrodynamic variables and what is their dynamics in this condensed or fluid phase ?",
    "how does it compare to gr ?    for what concerns the first ( set of ) question(s ) , the gft approach offers a potentially decisive reinterpretation : since spin foam are nothing else than feynman graphs of a gft , and that spin foam models are nothing else than their corresponding feynman amplitudes , the coarse graining of a spin foam model , either performed as outlined in @xcite or with the techniques introduced in @xcite , corresponds exactly to the _ perturbative renormalisation _ of the corresponding gft . on the one hand this suggests to deal with the problem of continuum approximation of spin foams using all the perturbative and non - perturbative renormalisation group techniques from ordinary field theory adapted to the gft case . on the other hand gives a further justification for the idea , proposed in @xcite , that the connes - kreimer hopf algebra of renormalisation developed for qft could be the right type of formalism to use in such a quantum gravity context .    as for the second ( set of ) question(s ) , the gft approach identifies uniquely the basic building blocks of a quantum space , those that could be responsible for the kind of condensationprocess or the transition to a fluid phase at the root of the emergence of a smooth spacetime in some approximation and physical regime , and gives a precise prescription for their classical and quantum dynamics , that can now be investigated . in particular , one could develop a statistical mechanics picture for the dynamics of the gft atomsof space , and then the above idea of a condensationor in general of the possibility of an hydrodynamic description could be tested in specific gft models , and in very concrete and precise terms , using once more usual techniques from statistical field theory ( as applied for example in condensed matter systems ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the possible development of gfts along these lines can be found in @xcite .",
    "whether any of the above ideas will be realised , and whether other , not yet imagined , possibilities for new developments will become manifest in the near future , only further work will tell . in our opinion , however , it is already clear that the gft approach can be the right framework for asking the most fundamental questions about quantum gravity , and for finding answers to them .    99 d. oriti , in _ mathematical and physical aspects of quantum gravity _ , b. fauser , j. tolksdorf and e. zeidler , eds .",
