    "the aim of this paper is to investigate certain aspects arising in the numerical treatment of the following eigenvalue problem ( evp ) : @xmath0 subject to boundary conditions @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the function @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 @xmath5 is an eigenvalue , and @xmath6 is the associated eigenfunction",
    ".    equation ( [ prob ] ) is known in the literature as _ radial _ schrdinger equation with _ underlying potential _",
    "@xmath7 an important example of this type of problems is the hydrogen atom equation corresponding to @xmath8 with @xmath9 + many currently available numerical techniques to handle this problem are based on the so - called _ regularization _ which , in our context , may mean replacing ( [ bc ] ) by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is strictly positive and small and @xmath12 is large .",
    "clearly , equation ( [ prob ] ) subject to ( [ bct ] ) is a regular sturm - liouville problem on @xmath13 $ ] and classical methods can be used to approximate its eigenvalues . the accuracy of these approximations ,",
    "however , strongly depends on the choice of the cutoff points @xmath11 and @xmath12 as discussed , for example , in @xcite . concerning the choice of @xmath14 a generalization of the so - called wkb - approximation introduced in @xcite for nonharmonic oscillators , was proposed in @xcite . in case of a problem",
    "whose potential has a coulomb - like tail , the authors proposed to impose suitably adapted boundary conditions at the right endpoint @xmath12 which allowed a noticeable reduction of the size of @xmath15 on the other hand , an ad - hoc procedure , treating @xmath3 as a perturbation of the reference potential @xmath16 in a neighborhood of the origin , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this procedure was to find an approximation for @xmath17 and @xmath18 all these estimates were then used in a two - sided shooting procedure .",
    "+ the approach proposed here is different . we first apply suitable change of variable , @xmath19 , in order to transform the problem posed on @xmath20 to a problem posed on a finite domain @xmath21 after the transformation the evp assumes the following general form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are singular at @xmath24 and/or @xmath25 the evp ( [ sisewa0 ] ) is then augmented by suitable boundary conditions .",
    "we use results provided in @xcite to show that the above singular evp is well - posed and to describe the smoothness of its solution .",
    "numerical approximations of the eigenvalues are obtained by applying the so - called matrix methods which transform the evp for the differential operator into a generalized algebraic evp .",
    "more precisely , the equation ( [ sisewa0 ] ) is discretized in its original second order formulation by using the finite difference schemes introduced in @xcite .",
    "we stress that the application of these methods is possible in spite of the singularities at @xmath26 , since the corresponding discrete problem does not involve the values of the coefficients functions in ( [ sisewa0 ] ) at the interval endpoints .",
    "+ it is worth mentioning that the idea of reducing the continuous problem to a finite domain was already used in the development of the codes sleign2 @xcite and slf02f @xcite . nevertheless , the numerical schemes used in the implementation of the shooting procedure make use of the coefficient functions at the endpoints .",
    "this means that , in our case , where such functions become unbounded , cutting off the interval ends becomes inevitable .",
    "+ we have organized the paper as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we propose two ways of changing the independent variable for the transformation of the original problem to a finite domain and discuss the properties of the resulting singular bvps and evps . in section [ sec3 ] , we describe in some detail the numerical procedure based on the matrix method . finally , section [ sec4 ] contains the results of the numerical simulation for the hydrogen atom equation and models studied in @xcite . here",
