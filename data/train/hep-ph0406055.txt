    "the large cp violation in @xmath1 decay mode predicted by the standard model with kobayashi - masukawa ( km ) scheme has been verified by @xmath2 factories at kek ( high energy accelerator research organization ) and stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) .",
    "the standard model predicts the cp asymmetries for @xmath1 and @xmath3 to be equal to @xmath4 .",
    "however , recent experimental data from belle showed that these asymmetries differ by nearly @xmath5 ; the averaged @xmath4 from bell and babar in @xmath6 system is @xmath7 @xcite and in @xmath3 decay mode is @xmath8 from belle @xcite , and @xmath9 from babar @xcite .",
    "experimental error is still large , so the situation is inconclusive , but if this result continues to hold , it implies existence of new physics beyond the standard model .    in this paper , we want to concentrate on @xmath10 decay mode .",
    "the decay mode has large a branching ratio , so the experimental error on the cp asymmetry has been getting small and is now down to several percent .",
    "@xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    cp asymmetry is defined as @xmath14 and in general , theoretical predictions of the cp asymmetries depend less on hadronic parameters than those of branching ratios as many uncertainties cancel in the ratio .",
    "so comparing predictions for cp asymmetries within the standard model with experimental data may be effective way to search for new physics .",
    "many authors have pointed out for some time , that the cp asymmetry in this mode is very small .",
    "we can easily understand why the asymmetry is so small . in order to generate cp asymmetry , at least two amplitudes with nonvanishing relative weak and strong phases",
    "must interfere .",
    "this decay is mainly caused by an @xmath15 operator , and other contributions which interfere with this contribution are small and the cabibbo - kobayashi - masukawa quark - mixing matrix ( ckm ) unitary triangle is crushed , making the cp asymmetry in this decay mode very small .",
    "however , if we were to look for new physics , we need to be able to give a quantitative estimate of the standard model contribution to the cp asymmetry . for this purpose ,",
    "we include small contributions which interfere with @xmath15 , including also the long distance contributions , for example , @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the isospin breaking effect @xmath17 is also very interesting because it s size and sign are sensitive to the existence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "@xmath18 in order to test the standard model , we need to know if the penguin contribution within the standard model can explain the experimental data .",
    "experiments show @xmath19 in bell @xcite and @xmath20 in babar @xcite .",
    "more precise data will become available in the near future , so the theoretical prediction of it s size and sign of this asymmetry should be pinned down .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the branching ratio , direct cp asymmetry , and isospin breaking effects in @xmath21 decay mode , based on the standard model .",
    "first , we briefly review the concept of the pqcd in sect.[outline of pqcd ] , and in sect.[effective hamiltonian ] , we show the effective hamiltonian which causes @xmath21 decay",
    ". then we present the factorization formulas for the @xmath0 decay mode in sect.[formulas ] , and in sect.[long distance ] , we mention about the long distance contributions .",
    "next we will show the numerical results in sect.[numerical ] , and sect.[conclusion ] is our conclusion .",
    "finally in appendix a , we present a brief review of pqcd .",
    "theoretically , it is easy to analyze the inclusive @xmath2 meson decay like @xmath22 because we can estimate the decay width , for example , by inserting the complete set for all possible intermediate states . the experimental and theoretical branching ratio of @xmath23 are @xmath24 and this good agreement strongly constraints new physics parameters .",
    "however , inclusive decays are experimentally difficult to analyze because all @xmath25 candidates should be counted .",
    "if we can directly calculate the exclusive decay mode @xmath26 , we ought to obtain many interesting results to test the standard model or to search for new physics .",
    "perturbative qcd is one of the theoretical instrument for handling the exclusive decay modes .",
    "the concept of pqcd is the factorization between soft and hard dynamics . in order to physically understand the pqcd approach",
    ", we consider @xmath27 meson decays into @xmath28 meson and @xmath29 in the rest frame of the @xmath27 meson ( fig.[factorization ] ) .",
    "the heavy @xmath30 quark which has most of @xmath27 meson mass is nearly static in this frame and the other quark , which forms the @xmath27 meson together with the @xmath30 quark , called the spectator quark , carries momentum of order @xmath31 .",
    "this @xmath30 quark decays into the light @xmath32 quark and @xmath29 through the electromagnetic penguin operator and the decay products dash away back - to - back , with momentum of @xmath33 .",

    "this can also be computed in the pqcd approach .",
    "the diagram can be cut along the dotted line indicating the presence of the physical intermediate state .",
    "this results in a strong interaction phase which can be computed .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry is caused by interfering some amplitudes which have relative weak and strong phase , and it can be written in the form proportioning to @xmath38 : in short , it depends on both weak and strong phases .",
    "we can determine the strong phases by using the pqcd approach , then we can extract the information about the weak phases and examine the standard model .",
