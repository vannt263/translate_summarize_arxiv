    "the purpose of the vlba calibrator survey ( beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) , ( fomalont et al . 2003 ) was to extend the list of compact sources with coordinates known at the milliarcseconds level for use as calibrators for mapping and as target sources for geodetic applications . in total , the positions of 1608 new sources were obtained . as a result of processing vcs sessions the total number of sources with precise coordinates increased by a factor of three .",
    "the goals of the survey were : a ) to increase the surface density of known geodetic - grade calibrators with mas - accurate positions ; b ) to facilitate routine phase - referencing allowing high - resolution radio imaging of weak target sources ; c ) to provide a uniform image database at 2.3 and 8.4 ghz for use in scientific applications .",
    "observations were carried out in twelve 24 hour sessions .",
    "observations used the vlba dual - frequency geodetic mode observing simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "signal was recorded at four 8 mhz wide baseband channels over a large spanned bandwidth ( 100 mhz at s - band and 400 mhz at x - band ) .",
    "each source was observed 23 times for 6090 sec .",
    "before analysis of the vcs sessions the number of sources observed under geodesy / astrometry programs with positions known better than 1 nrad was 615 . after analysis of the vcs campaign",
    "this number increased to 2011 .",
    "now there is at least one calibrator within @xmath0 of any target direction at 90.1% of the sky at declinations @xmath1 , as shown in figure  [ f : f1 ] .",
    "[ f : f1 ]    some 15% of sources from the vcs lists were observed previously in astrometric / geodetic programs .",
    "analysis of the differences between the vcs catalogues and goddard gsf2003c catalogue allowed us to assess the error model . as a result of this analysis",
    "the formal uncertainties were inflated in this way : @xmath2    @xmath3 and @xmath4 are declination dependent :     @xmath5 + ( deg ) & ( mas ) & ( mas ) + @xmath6 $ ] & 0.3 & 0.3 + @xmath7 $ ] & 0.3 & 0.6 + @xmath8 $ ] & 0.6 & 1.1 +",
    "amplitude and initial phase calibration was done by aips software .",
    "sources were imaged by the caltech difmap package .",
    "some 70% of sources were imaged automatically , the others were imaged manually .",
    "the typical image rms is 23 mjy , with dynamic range 30:1 or better ."
