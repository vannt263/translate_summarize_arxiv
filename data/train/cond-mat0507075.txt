    "the silicon clusters are of potential relevance to nanoelectronics industry and hence remain subject of many experimental as well as theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies are devoted to the investigation of lowest equilibrium geometries of small silicon clusters , motivated by the experimental findings that si clusters undergo structural transition ( prolate to spherical ) in the range 22 - 34  @xcite .",
    "to date , global minima of silicon clusters with sizes n@xmath324 have been well established from various recent unbiased searches such as genetic algorithm , single - parent evolution algorithm , ` big bang ' optimization etc  @xcite .",
    "the surface induced dissociation studies revealed that the fragmentation behavior is common within the clusters of semiconducting group 14 elements  @xcite .",
    "studies on silicon clusters of various sizes report existence of fragmentation pathway as compared to evaporation process  @xcite and predict that clusters with sizes 6 - 10 are the most abundant fragments and are referred to as magic fragments  @xcite .",
    "although , it is speculated that silicon clusters up to sizes @xmath4 will undergo fragmentation rather than evaporation  @xcite , it is not yet clear if the clusters undergo the traditional solid - like to liquid - like transition before fragmenting or they fragment without melting as reported recently in case of tin clusters  @xcite .",

    "our detailed analysis of finite temperature behavior shows that the finite temperature behavior of si@xmath0 is dominated with isomerization and it is rather difficult to identify the region corresponding to solid - like to liquid - like transition .",
    "however , the cluster clearly fragments around 2800  k. si@xmath1 , on the other hand , does exhibit a liquid like phase over a short temperature range before fragmenting around 1800  k. si@xmath2 does not melt but fragments around 1200  k.    both silicon and tin are group iv elements and it is interesting to note some peculiarities of this group .",

    "interestingly , si , ge and sn clusters with sizes @xmath7 9 are built on stable ttp unit which , as we shall see , plays a crucial role in finite temperature behavior of these clusters .",
    "however , in contrast to silicon clusters , tin clusters undergo a size rearrangement from prolate ( stacked ttp units ) to a more compact spherical shape in a considerably broad range ( from 35 - 65 atom cluster ) .",
    "the ionic mobility experiments exploited the fact that small tin clusters have prolate ground states .",

    "various other thermodynamic indicators such as mean square displacements ( msd ) of atoms and root - mean square bond - length fluctuations ( rms - blf , @xmath25 ) are computed .",
    "more technical details concerning the extraction of thermodynamics averages , indicators and computation of specific heat curve can be found in our earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    first , we discuss the finite temperature behavior of si@xmath0 .",
    "the ground state and various excited state geometries of si@xmath0 are shown in fig.[fig.geom ]  ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "the ground state of si@xmath0 is a tetra capped trigonal prism ( similar to that of sn@xmath0  @xcite ) and is consistent with the one reported earlier  @xcite .",
    "it may be noted with some interest that the ground state and the first excited state structure ( higher by 0.2  ev ) contain one ttp unit whereas all other excited configurations do not contain a ttp unit .",
    "this explains the significant energy difference ( of @xmath26  1  ev ) between the first two equilibrium structures and the remaining excited state structures .",
    "we also note that in the ground state geometry , all the atoms except one capping the triangular face of trigonal prism have a minimum of four - fold coordination .",
    "the nature of bonding is analyzed using elf which shows the expected covalent bonding among all the silicon atoms .",
    "= 0.5    next , we discuss the calculated ionic specific heat curve for si@xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cv.si10 ] .",
    "the salient features of the curve are presence of a broad shoulder from 350  k to 1400  k and a main peak at 2300  k. an analysis of ionic motion at various temperatures , reveals several additional aspects .",
    "the shoulder at 350  k arises from a structural transition of cluster from the ground state to the first excited state and back to the ground state .",
    "this process is due to the attempt of the tri - coordinated atom ( the atom capping the triangular face of the trigonal prism ) to acquire the forth neighbor .",
    "the isomerization seen around 350  k is quite similar to that of sn@xmath0  @xcite and occurs in such a way that at least three atoms ( cap on triangular face , rectangular face and one from the trigonal prism ) exchange their positions without changing the geometry considerably .",
    "this transition occurs with increased frequency until 1400  k and leads to the diffusion of atoms through out the cluster without considerable change in the geometry .",
    "it is only at 1600  k and beyond that structures corresponding to the other excited states ( which are higher in energy by almost 1 ev ) are observed .",
    "thus , the rise in the specific heat curve observed after 1400  k is associated with the destruction of the ttp unit and occurrence of other excited states . at much higher temperatures , around 2300  k and above",
    ", we observe several high lying configurations which can be thought of as two weakly bonded clusters of smaller sizes , with energies above 2.5  ev with respect to the ground state .",
    "the cluster eventually fragments around 2800  k into si@xmath27 and si@xmath28 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.disso.si10 ] .",
    "= 0.2    thus , though the main peak in the specific heat curve of si@xmath0 is seen around 2300  k , it can not be attributed to the solid - like to liquid - like transition .",
    "in fact , we believe that this peak is due to the fragmentation that occurs around 2800  k. this is also evident from the analysis of the root mean square bond - length fluctuations ( @xmath29 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.delta](a ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath25 is characterized by two sharp increments , first one from 175 - 650  k and another at 2800  k. according to the bulk lindemann criterion a value of @xmath25 greater than 0.1 is indicative of transition from solid phase to    = 0.5    liquid phase . in bulk , the solid - liquid transition is sharp whereas in clusters , the transition is gradual and is observed that , in a liquid - like phase , the value of @xmath25 saturates around @xmath30 . at 650",
    "k @xmath25 reaches a value of 0.2 .",
    "this is due to the fact that gs - first excited state - gs transition results in diffusion of atoms through out the cluster thereby saturating the value of @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is almost constant for next 1000  k ( i.e. up to 1600  k ) . above 1600  k ,",
    "coincident with the destruction of ttp unit , the @xmath25 experiences a gradual and slow rise until 2600  k. this gradual rise ends with a second sharp jump at 2800  k due to fragmentation of the cluster .",
    "next we analyze the average distribution of atoms from center of mass ( com ) of the cluster as a function of temperature ( shown in fig .  [ fig.atomic.distribution ] ) .",
    "we have plotted the probability of finding an atom as a function of distance from the com . at low temperatures ,",
    "a perfect shell structure is retained , as observed for 100  k ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.atomic.distribution]a ) .",
    "it can be easily identified that the first two peaks correspond to    = 0.5    the two faces of the trigonal prism , the third peak corresponds to the caps on the rectangular surfaces and the last one is due to the cap on the triangular face . with increasing temperature , the peaks begin to merge in the bottom , ( as seen around and above 350  k ) indicating an exchange of atoms between various shells . around 650  k ,",
    "four peaks merge into two and the distribution of atoms remains identical till 1400  k. above 1600  k , the com plot indicates absence of any sort of average order in the arrangement of the atoms .",
    "the peak gets more broader at higher temperatures and around 2300  k ( coincident with the peak in the specific heat ) , the atomic distribution from com is seen as a broad curve",
    ".    in short , the main peak in the specific heat curve occurs around 2300  k which is due to fragmentation .",
    "the lindemann criteria , atomic distribution of atoms around com and other qualitative parameters indicate diffusive motion of atoms within the cluster around 650  k. although , for a very broad range of temperatures , from 650  k to 1400  k , the cluster undergoes characteristic isomerization discussed earlier , it retains the shape of the cluster , but allows diffusion of the atoms through out the cluster . thus ,",
    "finite temperature behavior of very small clusters like si@xmath0 , is dominated by isomerization .",
    "the solid - like to liquid - like transition is continuous and it is rather difficult to discern the transition temperatures for the same .",
    "this is also confirmed by our on going studies on small sodium and lithium clusters  @xcite .",
    "turning to the finite temperature study of si@xmath1 , we first discuss the equilibrium structures of si@xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](e to h ) .",
    "the ground state geometry of si@xmath1 can be described as a tricapped trigonal prism fused with a tricapped trigonal anti prism ( c@xmath31 symmetry fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](e ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with the lowest energy configuration reported by ccsd(t )  @xcite and dft simulations  @xcite . the first excited state consists of two ttp units sharing a common triangular face as shown in fig.[fig.geom](f )",
    "this structure can be viewed as a serious distortion of the lower six atom ring present below the ttp unit in the ground state .",
    "the first few excited states are built on ttp unit of si@xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](f,g ) , whereas isomers observed at higher temperatures can be thought of as a combination of two small silicon clusters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](h ) and suggest probable paths for fragmentation .",
    "the ionic specific heat curve computed for si@xmath1 ( see fig.[fig.cv.si15 ] ) has two small peaks around 400  k and 800  k and a main peak around 1400  k which is associated with fragmentation of the cluster around 1800  k. ionic motions of si@xmath1 cluster at various temperatures provide a plausible explanation for different features observed in the specific heat curve .",
    "= 0.5    we would also like to note that si@xmath1 has many low lying isomers ( we have at least 30 different equilibrium structures out of which few relevant structures are shown in the figure ) unlike si@xmath0 .",
    "the isomerization begins around 400  k when we observe the first excited state within our calculation ( fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](f ) ) .",
    "this involves rearrangement of lower six atom ring . with further rise in temperature ,",
    "the cluster remains in the first excited state for a reasonable amount of time after which the atoms in upper ttp unit reorient into a six atom ring leading to an inverted ground state .",
    "thus , the first excited state appears to be an intermediate for interchanging the positions of ttp unit and the hexagonal ring in the ground state .",
    "this isomerization process does not involve diffusion of atoms within the cluster and continues to occur with increased frequency until 700  k. further rise in temperature leads to several other isomerization routes along with the one described above which results in to diffusion of atoms through out the cluster .",
    "this corresponds to the second shoulder seen in the specific heat curve around 800  k ( see fig .  [ fig.cv.si15 ] ) .",
    "around 1200  k isomers corresponding to two small silicon clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](h ) ) are observed in the ionic motion which provide a fragmentation path at higher temperatures .",
    "the @xmath25 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.delta](c ) ) and the distribution of atoms from com of si@xmath1    = 0.5    ( shown in fig .  [ fig.com.si15 ] ) support these observations .",
    "linear rise in @xmath25 at lower temperatures is indicative of pure vibrational motion .",
    "beginning of isomerization is shown up as a rise in @xmath25 around 400  k which continues till 900  k. the value of @xmath25 saturates after 900  k showing a liquid - like state over a short temperature range .",
    "around this temperature , the diffusive motion of atoms between the upper and lower units of si@xmath1 is clearly seen in the distribution of atoms from the com plot .",
    "the value of @xmath25 increases abruptly around 1800  k due to the fragmentation of si@xmath1 into si@xmath32 and si@xmath33 clusters .",
    "it is interesting to compare the finite temperature behavior of si@xmath1 and si@xmath0 .",
    "although , both clusters fragment , si@xmath1 ( 1800  k ) dissociates at considerably lower temperature than si@xmath0 ( 2600  k )  @xcite . in case of si@xmath0 ,",
    "all isomers except one , are at much higher in energy . as a result ,",
    "the cluster undergoes a peculiar isomerization ( described earlier ) over a wide range of temperatures ( 350  k to 1400  k ) leading to a broad shoulder in the specific heat curve and a flat region in the @xmath25 plot . on the other hand , in case of si@xmath1 , the isomerization region is spread over comparatively shorter range of temperatures ( 400  k to 900  k ) .    as we have already noted , for the clusters of group iv elements , ttp forms a basic block on which larger clusters are built upon .",
    "as will be discussed , the ground state of si@xmath2 is a prolate structure whereas the ttp unit is evident in the excited states .",
    "though the fragmentation of si@xmath2 is expected , it will be interesting to see if the fragmentation is preceded by a liquid like state . in what follows ,",
    "we present the thermodynamics of si@xmath2 cluster . in fig.[fig.geom](i ) to ( l ) , we show the ground state as well as some of the excited state geometries of si@xmath2 .",
    "the lowest - energy isomer of si@xmath2 is composed of three units : a so called magic number cluster si@xmath33 , a hexagonal chair unit in the middle , and a low energy isomer of si@xmath34 unit .",
    "the first excited state consist of two distinct ttp units whereas the second one is non - prolate , spherical structure .",
    "the forth equilibrium structure that we have shown in the figure , ( see fig.[fig.geom](l ) ) has two si@xmath0 units connected via very weak bonds ( bond lengths @xmath35 as compared to the normal si - si covalent bondlength of 2.34   ) . as we shall see , the cluster fragments via this isomer .",
    "all the equilibrium structures shown here are consistent with earlier reports  @xcite .",
    "the nature of bonding is examined using elf .",
    "as expected , elf for the ground state shows a high covalent bonding with all the basins completely connected by an isovalue of 0.75 .",
    "it is also observed from elf that the two ttp units in fig .",
    "[ fig.geom](l ) are weakly bonded to each other . turning to the finite temperature behavior of si@xmath2",
    ", we note that till 800  k , atoms in the cluster vibrate about their mean positions and no isomerization is observed .",
    "around 1000  k , the cluster transforms from the ground state to the excited state having two distinct si@xmath0 units ( fig .",
    "[ fig.geom]-(l ) ) and eventually fragments into two si@xmath0 units around 1200  k. this is reflected in the @xmath29 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.delta](d ) where the fragmentation is evident from the sharp rise around 1200  k. in other words , finite temperature behavior of si@xmath2 does not show solid - liquid transition prior to fragmentation .",
    "this may be attributed to the low dissociation energy barrier in case of si@xmath2 cluster ( of the order of 1.2  ev ) in comparison to that of si@xmath0 and si@xmath1 ( which have a dissociation energy barrier of 4.2  ev and 2.2  ev respectively )  @xcite . to understand the influence of starting geometry on the fragmentation behavior of the cluster",

    "consequently , the two ttp units begin to interact leading to high lying configurations ( containing no ttp units ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.config ] .",
    "the ionic motion of this super heated cluster shows that the cluster does not fragment at the end of 100  ps . on the contrary , a complete diffusive motion of atoms within the cluster",

    "finite temperature study of sn@xmath2 cluster within lda approximation shows the cluster to fragment into two sn@xmath0 units around 1000  k. the failure to detect the fragmentation behavior in our earlier reports is attributed to the following reasons : ( a ) faster heating rate ( 1  k in 0.01 ps ) with smaller simulation time scales in our earlier simulations ( 40  ps per temperature ) .",
    "( b ) use of lda functional in our earlier reports . as already mentioned ground state sn@xmath2  @xcite cluster has inhomogeneous bond strength distribution . while the bonds within intra - ttp atoms are strongly covalent in nature , inter - ttp atoms are connected through very weak covalent bonds .",
    "the lda approximation was unable to distinguish these differences leading to an over - estimation of binding energies between the two ttp units .",
    "hence , the sn@xmath2 cluster did not fragment in the small simulation times scales reported earlier .",
    "sn@xmath0 cluster in contrast , has all its atoms connected with similar bond strengths , resulting in a more accurate finite temperature behavior within the lda approximation .",
    "we have presented thermodynamics of small silicon and tin clusters ( si@xmath0 , si@xmath1 , si@xmath2 , sn@xmath0 and sn@xmath2 ) within lda and gga approximations of dft .",
    "finite temperature behavior of si@xmath0 and sn@xmath0 is dominated by isomerization process and fragmentation is observed around 2800  k and 2600  k respectively .",
    "the peak in the specific heat curves around 2300  k and 2200  k for si@xmath0 and sn@xmath0 correspond to the observed fragmentation rather than solid - like to liquid - like transition .",
    "the similarities observed in the finite temperature behavior of these two clusters suggest the influence of ground state structures on the finite temperature behavior of a cluster .",
    "the specific heat curve of si@xmath1 has a main peak around 1400  k which is due to the fragmentation observed around 1600  k. however , the cluster exhibits a liquid like behavior over a short temperature range ( 900  k to 1400  k ) before fragmenting .",
    "si@xmath2 and sn@xmath2 are found to dissociate without melting around 1200  k and 650  k respectively .",
    "our simulations on sn@xmath2 agree with the recently reported experimental results .",
