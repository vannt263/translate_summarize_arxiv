    "decays of the @xmath0 provide an excellent source of events with which to study light hadron spectroscopy and search for glueballs , hybrids , and exotic states . since the discovery of the @xmath0 at brookhaven  @xcite and slac  @xcite in 1974 , more than one hundred exclusive decay modes of the @xmath0 have been reported .",
    "recently , @xmath4 @xmath0 events and @xmath5 @xmath1 events have been obtained with the upgraded beijing spectrometer ( besii ) , and these samples offer a unique opportunity to measure precisely the branching fractions of @xmath0 decays .",
    "the largest @xmath6 decay involving hadronic resonances is @xmath7 .",
    "its branching fraction has been reported by many experimental groups  @xcite assuming all @xmath8 final states come from @xmath9 .",
    "the precision of these measurements varies from @xmath10 to 25% . in this paper , we present two independent measurements of this branching fraction using @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "the first is an absolute measurement based on @xmath11 directly .",
    "the second , in which many of the systematic errors cancel out , is a relative measurement obtained from a comparison of the rates for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , using @xmath6 events produced via @xmath13 .",
    "the upgraded besii detector operates at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) ; it is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that is described in detail in ref .",
    "the momentum of charged particles is determined by a 40-layer cylindrical main drift chamber ( mdc ) which has a momentum resolution of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is in units of gev / c .",
    "particle identification is accomplished using specific ionization ( @xmath16 ) measurements in the drift chamber and time - of - flight ( tof ) information in a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "the @xmath16 resolution is @xmath17 ; the tof resolution for bhabha events is @xmath18 ps .",
    "radially outside the time - of - flight counters is a 12-radiation - length barrel shower counter ( bsc ) comprised of gas proportional tubes interleaved with lead sheets .",
    "the bsc measures the energies and directions of photons with resolutions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 mrad , and @xmath21 cm .",
    "the iron flux return of the magnet is instrumented with three double layers of counters ( muc ) that are used to identify muons .    in the analysis ,",
    "a geant3 based monte carlo program ( simbes ) with detailed consideration of detector performance ( such as dead electronic channels ) is used .",
    "the consistency between data and monte carlo has been checked in many high purity physics channels , and the agreement is reasonable .",
    "each charged track , reconstructed using hits in the mdc , must ( 1 ) have a good helix fit , in order to ensure a correct error matrix in the kinematic fit ; ( 2 ) originate from the interaction region , @xmath22 cm and @xmath23 cm , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the x , y , and z coordinates of the point of closest approach of the track to the beam axis ; ( 3 ) have a transverse momentum greater than 60 mev / c ; and ( 4 ) have @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the polar angle of the track .      a neutral cluster in the bsc is assumed to be a photon candidate if the following requirements are satisfied : ( 1 ) the energy deposited in the bsc is greater than 0.06 gev ; ( 2 ) the total number of layers with deposited energy is greater than one ; ( 3 ) the angle between the direction of photon emission and the direction of shower development is less than @xmath29 ; and ( 4 ) the angle between the photon and the nearest charged track is greater than @xmath30 .",
    "if the angle between two neutral clusters is less than @xmath31 and their @xmath32 invariant mass is less than 0.05 gev / c@xmath33 , they are combined with the cluster with the largest energy being used for the direction and energy of the combined cluster in the kinematic fit .",
    "events with two oppositely charged tracks and at least two good photons are selected for further analysis . no charged particle identification is required . a 5-constraint ( 5c )",
    "kinematic fit is made under the @xmath34 hypothesis with the invariant mass of the two photons being constrained to the @xmath35 mass .",
    "if the number of the selected photons is larger than two , the fit is repeated using all permutation of the photons . for events with a good fit",
    ", the two photon combination with the minimum fit @xmath36 is selected , and its value is required to be less than 15 . to select a clean sample ,",
    "the following criteria are applied to the remaining events :    * to reject the main background events from @xmath37 , a 5c kinematic fit for @xmath37 is performed , and @xmath38 is required .",
    "[ chisq ] shows the scatter plot of @xmath36 versus @xmath39 . +",
    "* background events from @xmath40 conversions ( @xmath41 ) are eliminated by requiring the angle between the two charged tracks , @xmath42 , to be greater than @xmath31 . * radiative events , for example @xmath43",
    ", are removed by the requirement @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angle of the @xmath40 in the @xmath35 rest frame .",
    "* contamination from @xmath46 is eliminated by the requirement that the sum of the deposited energies of the two charged pions in the bsc is less than 2 gev .",
    "[ e1e2 ] shows the scatter plot of @xmath47 versus @xmath48 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the deposited energies of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the bsc , respectively .",
    "this criteria has almost no effect on @xmath51 events .",
    "+    after the above requirements , 219691 @xmath51 candidates are selected .",
    "remaining backgrounds are evaluated using two different monte carlo simulations . in the first , specific background channels , shown in table [ bkg ] ,",
    "are generated .",
    "the total background from these channels in the selected @xmath51 events is determined to be less than 1% .",
    "the second simulation uses 30 million inclusive @xmath0 mc events generated with the lund model  @xcite . after normalizing the selected background events to 58 million @xmath0 events ,",
    "3799 background events are obtained , yielding a contamination of 1.7% . in this paper ,",
