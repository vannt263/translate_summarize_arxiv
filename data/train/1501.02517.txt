    "but first we establish that the @xmath0-dimensional all - but - simple spindles of length @xmath2 , on which weibel and santos start their constructions , are counterexamples to the nonrevisiting conjecture .",

    "a @xmath3-dimensional all - but - simple spindle @xmath4 of length @xmath9 is a counterexample to the nonrevisiting conjecture .",
    "let @xmath4 be a @xmath3-dimensional all - but - simple spindle of length @xmath9 .",
    "then every path from @xmath5 to @xmath6 revisits at least one facet .",
    "let @xmath10 be the @xmath11 facets incident to @xmath5 , and let @xmath12 be the @xmath13 facets incident to @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath14 $ ] be a path from @xmath5 to @xmath6 of length @xmath15 , with all of the @xmath16 being simple vertices .",
    "as simple vertices , each @xmath16 is incident to @xmath3 facets .",
    "@xmath17 is incident to @xmath18 facets in @xmath10 and one facet in @xmath12 , and @xmath19 is incident to one facet in @xmath10 and @xmath18 facets in @xmath12 .",
    "the incidence table for @xmath20 looks like the following : @xmath21    consider the facet - departures and facet - arrivals from @xmath17 to @xmath19 ( the simple part of the path ) .",
    "if any of the arrivals were back to a facet in @xmath10 , this would be a revisit since these facets were all incident to the starting vertex @xmath5 .",

    "any departure from a facet in @xmath12 would create a revisit since at @xmath6 the path would be incident to all of the facets in @xmath12 .",
    "there are too many arrivals and departures to prevent a revisit .",
    "the vertex @xmath17 is incident to @xmath18 facets in @xmath10 , and since each departure leaves a facet of @xmath10 , @xmath22 is incident to @xmath23 facets in @xmath10 .",
    "so @xmath24 has completely departed from @xmath10 , and we must therefore have @xmath25 .    thus if @xmath20 were nonrevisiting , this path would have length at most @xmath3 , contradicting the condition that the length @xmath15 .",
    "santos @xcite has produced all - but - simple spindles in dimension @xmath0 of length @xmath2 .",

    "we have the previously established results :    1 .",

    "the interesting gap that santos has addressed is this : suppose we have a nonsimple counterexample to the nonrevisiting conjecture , then how do we produce the corresponding counterexample to the hirsch conjecture ?",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional all - but - simple spindle @xmath4 produced by santos is a counterexample to the nonrevisiting conjecture , as we have verified above , but there are no facets not incident to either @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "so we can not apply the wedges as we would if @xmath7 were simple .",
    "we also can not arbitrarily perturb apart the facets incident to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to create a simple polytope that is a counterexample to the nonrevisiting conjecture .",
    "the revisit on a path may well occur along the last edge , the one terminating in @xmath6 .",
    "if we perturb the facets incident to @xmath6 , to create simple vertices , some of these revisits may be lost .",
    "initially , the spindle is all - but - simple , so the nonsimplicity is concentrated at the two special vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as we iteratively apply wedging , we create nonsimple edges , @xmath34-faces , and so on .",
    "there is structure to the nonsimplicity at the images of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and we have to consider how this affects our choice of the facet ( or its corresponding vertex in the dual ) for perturbation .",
    "a @xmath35-face @xmath36 of a polytope consists of a supporting @xmath35-dimensional space and a boundary .",
    "a facet incident to @xmath36 contributes either to defining the supporting space or to defining the boundary .",
    "so relative to a given @xmath35-face @xmath36 , we can partition incident facets into two sets : the space - supporting facets and the boundary facets .    for a simple @xmath35-dimensional face",

    "we call this last condition the requirement for _ affine support _ because in the dual setting , we may know that the points @xmath47 are affinely dependent , but there may be points in @xmath47 that do not contribute to this affine dependence . that is , for any affine dependence @xmath48 , the coordinate in @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath50 is always @xmath39",
    ". we will see examples of this below .",
    "the _ excess _ of a nonsimplicity is the quantity @xmath51 , the number of facets supporting the face beyond those necessary in a simple polytope .",

    "the vertices @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not simple vertices , but in each case the nonsimple vertex is the intersection of one facet with the nonsimplicity in the vertical edge .",
    "so although the vertex @xmath57 is not simple , the facets incident to @xmath57 do not satisfy the condition of affine support ; in particular the top facet does not contribute to the nonsimple edge .",

    "the nonsimplicity occurs in the supporting @xmath34-space .",
