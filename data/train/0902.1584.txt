    "the electronic ground state of a periodic system is solved in a set of bloch functions ( bfs ) .",
    "they are eigenfucntions of both the hamiltonian and lattice translation operators and characterized by two good quantum numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the band index and crystal momentum , respectively .",
    "though bfs are widely used in electronic structure calculations , they are difficult to be visualized due to their delocalized nature and hence do not offer an intuitive physical picture for chemical bonding and other local correlations . an alternative representation which can overcome these weaknesses is wannier functions ( wfs ) . compared with bfs ,",
    "wfs are localized in real space and constitute a description in terms of localized functions .",
    "the localization properties of wfs depend on the choice of phase factors of the bfs . for a group of isolated bands ( isolated means this set of bands",
    "are connected among themselves by degeneracies in energy , but separated from others by finite energy gaps in the whole brillouin zone ) , the degrees of freedom in phase factors of bfs are equivalent to unitary transformations among themselves at each @xmath5 .",
    "marzari and vanderbilt@xcite developed a procedure which minimizes the spread of wfs ( the second moment around their centers ) by refining this degree of freedom .",
    "this procedure leads to wfs that are called maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) . if the bands of interest are not isolated and attached to , or cross with , other bands , a prescription for extracting the interested bands out of entangled bands is required .",
    "this disentanglement procedure was proposed by souza , mazari and vanderbilt @xcite which servers as a pre - processing before refining the unitary transformations among the selected bands .",
    "another method for constructing wfs with optimal localization properties is based on the @xmath6th order muffin - tin - orbital ( nmto ) method.@xcite in this work , we only consider the former approach .",
    "mlwfs have stimulated intensive interests since it brings new hope to calculate several properties of materials which are quite hard to do within the representation of bfs .",
    "since they are real in contrast to the complex bfs and well localized in real space , one can visualize them and gain intuitive physical insight into the nature of chemical bonding .",
    "it is also possible to extract some characteristic parameters such as the mlwfs centers and spreads .",
    "the displacements of mlwfs center is directly related with modern theory of polarization .",
    "the hopping integrals among mlwfs from parameter - free first - principles calculations can be used to construct model hamiltonians , or as a starting point for lda+@xmath7@xcite or lda+dmft@xcite calculations for strongly - correlated systems .",
    "band structure interpolation based on hamiltonian in wfs representation is quite efficient , which can be used for highly accurate integration in reciprocal space@xcite such as that in calculating anomalous hall effect@xcite and electron - phonon coupling.@xcite mlwfs are also used for linear - scaling calculations for large systems .    in this paper , we report briefly the implementation of mlwfs within openmx,@xcite a first - principles electronic structure calculation software package , which is based on the linear combination of pseudo - atomic orbital ( lcpao ) basis functions and norm - conserving pseudopotentials within local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) . since openmx is designed for large - scale _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on parallel computers , our implementation is anticipated to allow a fast computation of mlwfs for a wide variety of materials such as biomaterials , carbon nanotubes , magnetic materials with different complex geometrical structures .    in this work ,",
    "one of the organometallic compounds vanadium - benzene sandwich - like complex,@xcite v@xmath8bz@xmath9 , is reexamined by our newly generated mlwfs .",
    "this complex is one of the analogues of ferrocene , a prototype of metallocene .",
    "experimentally , v@xmath8bz@xmath9 with @xmath10 have been found to be one - dimensional cluster and have ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state with the total magnetic moment increasing nearly linearly with the cluster size.@xcite inspired by these findings , several theoretical calculations@xcite have been made on ( vbz)@xmath11 , an ideal one - dimensional infinite chain . in those works , (",
    "vbz)@xmath11 is found to have highly stable fm ordering and shows half - metallic behavior .",
    "double exchange was proposed to be the mechanism of fm ordering.@xcite on the other hand , by examining the electronic structure from gga+@xmath7 calculations , we have proposed that the mechanism of fm stability should be that proposed by kanamori and terakura.@xcite while compared with the infinite chain , finite v@xmath8bz@xmath9 clusters are found to have much weaker fm stability though the same mechanism is applicable . by using a simple tight - binding model , we have shown that absence of p - d hybridization in one side of edge bz leads to magnetic polarization of edge bz even for the afm coupling of two v atoms , which reduces the total energy of afm situation and thus reduces the fm stability energy largely.@xcite in the present work , a much more straightforward and quantitative analysis in the representations of mlwfs shows that there is another important role of the energy difference between the edge bz and middle bz , which further destabilizes the fm state against afm one . by considering this",
    ", the tight - binding model constructed now gives more consistent result with that of the direct first - principles calculation .    in the following ,",
    "we will describe technical issues regarding the construction of mlwf within the lcpao method and then three closely related examples are studied , namely , bz molecule , v - bz infinite chain and v@xmath8bz@xmath9 ( @xmath4=2 ) finite cluster , to demonstrate the successful applications of our implementation .",
    "finally , we will conclude in section iv .",
    "we will briefly introduce the theory of mlwfs .",
    "only those aspects that are closely related with our lcpao method will be described in detail .",
    "details of general aspects can be found in the original papers ref . and ref . .",
    "some other technical issues can be found in ref . , which introduces another implementation of constructing mlwf , wannier90.@xcite      the @xmath4th wf , @xmath4 being the band index , localized in unit - cell at @xmath12 is defined as fourier transforms of an isolated band expressed by bf @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 where the integral is performed over the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the volume of unit cell and @xmath6 is the number of unit cells in the sample .",
    "@xmath16 is the undetermined phase factor , which brings indeterminacy of wf even transformed from a single isolated band . for a more general case with an isolated group of bands ,",
    "@xmath16 is generalized to a unitary transformation matrix @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of bfs in the isolated group of bands , the same as the number of wfs .",
    "in one single isolated band case , it has been proven that a suitable choice of the phase of @xmath16 leads to wfs which are real and exponentially decaying in real space.@xcite in multi - band case , the arbitrariness in the gauge transformation @xmath20 can be exploited . according to marzari and vanderbilt,@xcite among all of the arbitrary choices",
    ", a particular set will minimize the total spread of wfs , which is defined as @xmath21=\\sum_{n}[\\langle r^{2}\\rangle_n-\\langle r \\rangle_n^2],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the expectation values of operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the @xmath4th wf , respectively .",
    "both expectations expressed in wfs can be transformed into those in bfs as shown by blount.@xcite in practical calculation , a uniform k - grid is sampled to calculate the derivation of cell - periodic part of bfs in reciprocal space within finite difference approximation and the integral over k space is performed with summation over this grid . it is demonstrated that the dependence of @xmath26 on the gauge transformation @xmath20 is determined only by the so - called overlap integrals @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cell - periodic part of the bloch states @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the vector connecting neighboring @xmath5-points in the regularly discretized mesh of @xmath5-points .",
    "@xmath32 is at the center of optimizing the spread of wfs since both the spread function itself and its gradient with respect to @xmath20 are determined by it .",
    "actual calculation of @xmath32 depends on the basis set used for electronic structure calculation and will be described in the following subsection .",
    "the wave - function within lcapo method is defined as follow : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pseudo - atomic orbital @xmath36 centered on site @xmath37 in unit - cell @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the linear combination coefficients of them at @xmath5 for band @xmath40 .",
    "the overlap integral matrix element @xmath32 is @xmath41 defining that @xmath42 , it becomes @xmath43 in which each term depends on only the relative position @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 7 ) can be written as @xmath45 a uniform grid in real space is used to perform the integral . in practice , @xmath46 is expanded in terms of @xmath47 @xmath48 since @xmath49 is an extended operator , we find that an expansion up to 4th order is needed to well conserve the unitary condition of @xmath32",
    ". a denser @xmath50-space sampling will give smaller @xmath31 , which helps to improve this conservation and lower order expansion can be used .",
    "the minimization of the spread function begins with an initial guess for the target wfs .",
    "following the approach proposed by marzari and vanderbilt , a set of trial functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 $ ] , are taken as the initial guess of the @xmath53 target mlwfs . in our lcpao method , it is very convenient and natural to take the localized pseudo - atomic orbitals , which are the bases for expanding bfs , as the initial guesses .",
    "the center of each orbital can be put at any place in the unit - cell and all the other characters for atomic orbital , such as the radial and angular functions , can be easily controlled by using suitable pseudo - atomic orbitals .",
    "the possible hybrids among the atomic orbitals are also available .",
    "three closely related materials , single bz molecule , v - bz infinite chain and v@xmath0bz@xmath2 cluster , are chosen to demonstrate our implementation . to calculate their electronic structures , paos",
    "are generated by a confinement potential scheme.@xcite for both hydrogen and carbon , the cutoff radius is 5.0 a.u . while it is 6.5 a.u . for vanadium .",
    "when generating pseudopotential , the semicore 3s and 3p states of v atom are included as valence states .",
    "the exchange correlation energy functional within gga@xcite is used for all the systems .",
    "double - valence and polarization orbitals of each element are included as basis set : s2p2 , s2p2d1 and s2p2d2f1 are used for h , c and v , respectively.@xcite in the electronic structure calculation , the real - space grid technique@xcite is used with an energy cutoff of 250 ry in numerical integrations and in the solution of the poisson equation .",
    "the gga+@xmath7 calculation is done with the approach proposed in ref . .",
    "the geometrical structure of these materials are relaxed until the forces are less than @xmath54 a.u . for molecular or cluster calculation ,",
    "a supercell is used and the size is as large as 17 @xmath55 to assure that the interaction between neighboring cells can be neglected .",
    "benzene ( bz ) molecule is firstly studied with only @xmath56-point sampled in bz .",
    "nine molecular orbitals ( mo ) around the homo and lumo states are shown in fig .",
    "1 together with their eigenvalues and symmetries . clearly homo-2 , lumo+2 and doubly degenerate homo , lumo are composed of six @xmath57 orbitals on carbon atoms .",
    "all of the nine mos are used to construct six mlwfs , i. e. , @xmath58=9 ( note that @xmath58 denotes the number of band branches within the selected energy window as defined in ref . . ) and @xmath53=6 . a physically intuitive initial guess for this set of target mlwfs",
    "are six @xmath57 orbitals on each carbon atom . the disentangling process proposed in ref .",
    "is used to select an optimized @xmath59 subspace , which minimizes the gauge invariant part of the spread function , @xmath60 .",
    "after that , a steepest - decent ( sd ) method is used to minimize the gauge - dependent part of the spread function to find the proper gauge transformation . with this initial guess ,",
    "the total spread converged to @xmath61 @xmath62 within 50 sd steps .",
    "the obtained six mlwfs are obviously identical to each other and have the spread of 0.943 @xmath62 , which is only slightly smaller than the initial spread of 0.944 @xmath62 .",
    "mlwfs are real and have similar shape to the atomic @xmath57 orbital as shown in fig .",
    "although the initial guess of mlwfs are centered on each carbon atom , the converged mlwfs centers are slightly shifted outward the gravity center of bz by about 0.07 @xmath55 along each nearby c - h bond direction .    in table .",
    "i , we listed the hopping integrals between these six mlwfs in the same unit cell .",
    "@xmath63 means the mlwf centered around carbon atom i as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the first column shows the orbital energy of the @xmath57 type mlwfs . the hopping integral from @xmath64 to its two nearest neighbors @xmath65 and @xmath66 are -2.88 ev and those to further neighbors @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are 0.19 and -0.24 ev , respectively .",
    "the sign change in the hopping integral as the distance increases suggests that the wfs have oscillating tails to satisfy orthogonality relation .",
    ".the first column shows the orbital energy of the @xmath57 like mlwf of a bz molecule as an isolated one ( first row ) .",
    "the rest of the columns are for the hopping integrals from @xmath64 to other five mlwfs . in the second row",
    "is for the v - bz infinite chain .",
    "the numbers outside ( inside ) of the parenthesis are for spin up ( spin down ) channels .",
    "energies are in ev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar calculation with @xmath7=3.0 ev is performed to study how @xmath7 influences the mlwfs .",
    "compared with those in gga calculation , + @xmath7 makes the d - type ( @xmath57-type ) mlwfs with majority spin more localized ( extended ) , while those with minority spin more extended ( localized ) .",
    "the on - site energy of @xmath57 orbitals becomes -3.97 and -4.46 ev for spin up and spin down channels , respectively .",
    "the enhanced spin splitting of @xmath57 orbitals is induced by the enhanced spin splitting in v d orbitals .",
    "the hopping integrals between different @xmath57 orbitals keep nearly the same as those in gga case .",
    "similarly for v d orbitals , the spin splitting of the on - site energy is enhanced .",
    "for example for @xmath7=3.0ev , the spin up ( spin down ) on - site energies of d@xmath70 , d@xmath3 and d@xmath71 states are -6.00 ( -0.85 ) , -3.91 ( -0.37 ) and -1.38 ( -0.27 ) ev , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath57-@xmath72 hopping integrals have nearly no change .    by using the mlwfs obtained so far , we reexamine quantitatively the tight - binding model of ref . and .",
    "for this purpose , the atomic like mlwfs , @xmath63 ( @xmath731 to 6 ) , are converted to mos with symmetries of @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath3 . the essential point in ref .",
    "are summarized below .",
    "homos of bz and d@xmath74 , d@xmath75 orbitals having @xmath71 symmetry form quite strong bonds to hold the sandwich - like geometrical structure , while homo-2 and d@xmath76 orbitals having @xmath70 symmetry couples weakly . the orbital with strong d@xmath76 character",
    "is singly occupied and plays the role as a trigger of spin splitting .",
    "lumos and d@xmath77 , d@xmath78 orbitals having @xmath3 symmetry form bonds to mediate magnetic coupling and they are mainly responsible for the stability of fm states . our proposed mechanism for fm stability is described in fig .",
    "4 following kanamori and terakura.@xcite in this picture , the essential assumption is that the on - site energy of p@xmath3 states ( lumos of bz ) should be between those of the spin majority and minority d states of @xmath3 symmetry before switching on the p - d hybridization .",
    "then , p@xmath3 states could be negatively spin polarized due to the p - d hybridization leading to stability of the fm configuration .",
    "the validity of the above assumption can be easily checked by the molecular orbitals formed with @xmath63 ( @xmath731 to 6 ) .",
    "hybridization stabilizes the fm states .",
    "the dos ( a ) without and ( b ) with @xmath79 hybridization is plotted .",
    "the energy gain due to the charge transfer associated with the magnetic relaxation of p@xmath3 states is indicated . before @xmath79 hybridization",
    ", the on - site energies of p@xmath3 and d@xmath3 states are given in ev for both gga and gga+@xmath7 calculations .",
    "see the text for more details . ]",
    "similarly to a single bz molecule case , diagonalizing @xmath59 subspace hamiltonian constructed from the orbital energy and hopping integrals listed in table i gives the eigen - energies and eigenstates of homo-2 , homos , lumos and lumo+2 .",
    "lumos , which play crucial roles in the fm stability have eigen - energies of -1.87 and -1.99 ev for spin up and spin down case , respectively .",
    "these two values are just sitting in - between the on - site energies of majority d@xmath3 state , -2.33 ev and minority one , -1.35 ev in gga .",
    "this picture is valid also in gga+@xmath7 calculation . in this case",
    "the spin up and spin down p@xmath3 states are located at -1.59 and -2.12 ev , respectively , which are well sitting between spin up d@xmath3 states at -3.91 ev and those of spin down at -0.37 ev .",
    "the p - d hopping integral between lumos and d@xmath3 ( d@xmath77 , d@xmath78 ) orbitals can be easily obtained by using the hopping integrals between the atomic - like @xmath57 mlwfs and d@xmath3 orbitals .",
    "for example , one of the lumo states is given by@xmath80 then in spin up case by using the values listed in table iii the hopping integral from this lumo to d@xmath78 state is @xmath81 similarly , the hopping integrals between homos and d@xmath71 orbitals and that between homo-2 and d@xmath70 orbital can also be calculated as listed in table iii . the bonding strength of different bonds can be seen from these hopping integrals . for @xmath70 and @xmath71 bonds ,",
    "the values are around 0.026(0.171 ) and 1.66(1.68 ) ev , respectively .",
    "the larger difference between spin up and spin down values in @xmath70 bond case is a reflect of larger difference in spreads of d@xmath76 like wf in spin up and down channels .",
    "therefore , by the analysis using mlwfs , the physical pictures proposed in our previous work@xcite are directly and quantitively confirmed .",
    "we discussed the difference between infinite v - bz chain and finite v@xmath8bz@xmath9 clusters in our previous two works.@xcite the reasons for nearly degenerate fm and afm states in the finite v@xmath0bz@xmath2 are extensively discussed .",
    "the importance of edge bz is emphasized when compared with the infinite v - bz chain . in the finite cluster , the edge bzs having p - d hybridization only with one side of v atom can have magnetic relaxation even in the afm configuration , which is not possible in the infinite chain .",
    "this makes the afm state stabler and reduces the relative stability of fm state against afm state .",
    "the p - d hybridization between v and edge bz is stronger than that between v and middle bz , which decreases the fm stability energy further .",
    "however , the present more quantitative analysis using mlwfs has revealed an additional source for making the fm and afm states nearly degenerate in energy .",
    "the mlwfs for both fm and afm v@xmath0bz@xmath2 clusters have been constructed in the same way as above .",
    "we have found that mlwfs of edge bz are different from those of middle bz in several ways .",
    "1 ) the spreads of mlwfs from middle bz are slightly larger than those from edge bz by about 0.015 @xmath62 .",
    "2 ) the hopping integrals from middle bz to v d orbitals are slightly smaller than those from edge bzs since v is closer to edge bzs .",
    "this is consistent with our former analysis .",
    "3 ) the on - site energy of lumos ( p@xmath3 states ) on edge bz is about 0.78 and 0.88 ev higher than those on middle bz for spin up and spin down states , respectively .",
    "the reason for the relatively higher p@xmath3 states on edge bz is easily understood . since the middle bz is sandwiched by two v@xmath82 ions while each of the edge bzs have only one nearest v@xmath82 ion , the attractive electrostatic field on middle bz is stronger than that on edge bz and brings higher on - site energies for states on edge bzs . while in our former work,@xcite we assumed that the on - site energies of p@xmath3 states are the same for both middle and edge bzs .",
    "it is easy to check how the fm stability energy depends on the on - site energy difference between the edge bzs and middle bz by using the tight - binding model proposed in ref . .",
    "in that model , only @xmath3 bonds which are critical to the coupling of magnetic moments are considered .",
    "the parameters included in this model can be obtained directly from the construction of mlwfs .",
    "the on - site energy of p@xmath3 states on middle bz , @xmath83 , is found to be -2.34 ev ( average value of those in spin up and spin down channels ) .",
    "@xmath84 ( on site energy of non spin polarized d@xmath3 state ) and @xmath85 ( exchange parameter for d@xmath3 states ) can be deduced from the orbital energy of spin polarized d@xmath3 orbitals .",
    "they are found to be -2.13 and 1.18 ev , respectively .",
    "parameters for describing hybridizations between d@xmath3 orbitals and p@xmath3 states on edge bzs and middle bz are @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the values of 1.44 and 1.28 ev , respectively . by using these parameters , it is shown in fig .",
    "5 that the fm stability energy decreases as the energy difference in p@xmath3 states on edge bzs and middle bz increases .",
    "afm state becomes stabler than fm state ( fm stability energy becomes negative ) when p@xmath3 states on edge bz is about 0.67 ev higher than those on middle bz .",
    "this critical value is a little bit different from the value , around 0.83 ev , obtained directly from mlwfs since in this tight - binding model other contributions , such as those from @xmath70 bonds , are neglected .",
    "therefore , we think that the difference between edge bzs and middle bz in p@xmath3 states is another important source for the much reduced fm stability in finite clusters .     states ( @xmath88 ) on edge bzs and middle bz .",
    "the points where the fm stability energy equals 0.0 ev and the on - site energy difference being 0.83 ev are indicated by `` + '' symbols . ]",
    "we have implemented the construction of maximally localized wannier funcitons in the formalism of linear combination of pseudo - atomic orbitals first - principles calculations .",
    "the implementation is demonstrated to be applicable to both solid and molecular systems .",
    "the disentangling procedure works well for metallic cases also .",
    "the analysis of hopping integrals obtained from mlwfs for v - bz organometallic complex indicates that it is a proper way to find the tight - binding parameters from parameter - free _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "mlwfs provide useful information for the study of the bonding nature and physical mechanism in materials .",
    "as demonstrated in v - bz complexes , a new physical origin , the role of orbital energy difference between edge bz and middle bz neglected before , is naturally revealed by analysis with mlwfs .",
