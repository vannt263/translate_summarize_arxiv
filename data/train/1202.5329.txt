    "invasions of alien species are widespread phenomena , in principle affecting every ecosystem , usually with dramatic consequences on the native community , constituting a major threat to biodiversity @xcite . at the scale of interest for management purposes , i.e. the geographic scale , invasive species move across a heterogeneous landscape characterized by favorable and unfavorable areas .",
    "the presence of abiotic heterogeneity , in fact , characterizes most of natural habitats and plays a key role in invasion processes , influencing their rate of spread and outcome @xcite .    alongside with the empirical interest for the problem ,",
    "several modeling efforts have been dedicated to the understanding and prediction of the spatial spread of invading organisms in heterogeneous environments . within the framework of reaction diffusion models , building on the pioneering theoretical works of @xcite and @xcite on the `` critical patch size '' problem",
    ", @xcite gave a seminal contribution considering the invasion ( propagation ) of a population through a periodic heterogeneous environment ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the problem was extended including advective transport to study persistence and propagation of passively dispersing populations in oceans @xcite or rivers @xcite .",
    "the importance of the interplay between heterogeneity and advection has been recently reviewed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the role of both advection and landscape spatial structure is clearly relevant also to the dispersal of plants @xcite , whose seeds are transported by winds .    in this article , we focus on the interplay between abiotic heterogeneity and advection in invasions .",
    "we describe the dynamics in terms of an advection - reaction - diffusion model , which allows for mathematical tractability and quantitative predictions , e.g. , on the spreading rates .",
    "we consider an infinite system where a population stably saturates the carrying capacity on one side of the system and possibly invades the remaining part of the environment , which is assumed to be heterogeneous .",
    "our setting is quite general and widely applicable . in particular , it is relevant to situations in which one has a practically infinite biological reservoir of a species invading an empty territory characterized by abiotic heterogeneity .",
    "for instance , the above setting may be relevant to situations in which invasions can suddenly become possible for the removal of a climatic barrier due to climate changes @xcite .",
    "another relevant case is when a species stably populating a lake invades an effluent characterized by a certain degree of heterogeneity and stream velocity .",
    "this is one of the key early - stage processes related to the spatial control of invasions in lakes networks @xcite .",
    "other examples concern the spreading of wind - pollinated plants in a heterogeneous environment @xcite or spores carried by the wind @xcite .    more specifically , the habitat consists of a periodic alternation of unfavorable and favorable patches , as in @xcite .",
    "the population dies at a fixed rate in unfavorable regions , and grows in favorable ones according to either a logistic or an allee effect dynamics .",
    "we are interested in determining the conditions for invasions to be possible and in understanding how invasion speed and efficiency depend on the mechanisms at play .    with the logistic dynamics , in the absence of advection ,",
    "this problem was pioneered by @xcite , while @xcite considered both advection and heterogeneity in reference to the `` drift paradox '' problem @xcite .",
    "going beyond these works , we find asymptotic expressions for both the invasion speed and the rate of increase of the population size .",
    "the latter quantity essentially estimates the rate at which the number of invading individuals grows and , thus , provides a suitable measure of the efficiency of the spreading process .",
    "indeed , especially in invasive species control , it is important to quantify the potentiality of growth of an alien population , and not only the speed at which it colonizes the territory .",
    "we anticipate that , remarkably , larger invasion speeds do not necessarily imply more efficient invasions .",
    "the logistic case ( decreasing _ per capita _ growth rate ) is then contrasted with the case of positive density dependence corresponding to a demographic allee effect @xcite , which accounts for a reduced reproductive power at low densities .",
    "the importance of allee effects for the invasion and control of non - native species was emphasized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that even in homogeneous habitats the presence of the allee effect can decrease the invasion speed or even halt the population spreading if the initially occupied area is too small @xcite ( see also @xcite for recent field observations ) .",
    "we find that the interplay between heterogeneity and advection becomes very subtle in the presence of the allee effect .",
    "in fact it may happen that a persisting population , unable to invade new territory , becomes able to spread in the presence of strong advection .",
    "this effect should be taken as a cautionary note from the standpoint of controlling invasive species , telling us that advective transport should be considered .",
    "for instance , after strong weather events , or in regions characterized by prevailing winds , neglecting the effects of advection could lead to the erroneous prediction of a population unable to invade , whereas it actually propagates over the territory .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we present the model , and in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we qualitatively discuss its phenomenology",
    ". sections  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] present and discuss the main results on invasions with the logistic and the allee effect model , respectively . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] we summarize the results .",
    "the evolution of the population , @xmath0 , is governed by the advection - reaction - diffusion equation @xmath1 the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 and the advection velocity @xmath3 are assumed to be constant .",
    "heterogeneity is introduced in the growth term , @xmath4 , which depends on the position @xmath5 .",
    "the habitat consists of a periodic alternation of unfavorable and favorable patches of sizes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in the elementary cell",

    "the first is the classical logistic model ( with carrying capacity normalized to one ) @xmath14 @xmath15 being the intrinsic growth rate .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ard ] ) with the logistic term but without advection was firstly studied by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite included advection focusing on the `` drift paradox '' problem .",
    "secondly , accounting for a positive correlation between population density and _ per capita _ growth rate at small densities  the allee effect  @xcite  , we consider the threshold model @xmath16 prescribing that the population grows only when @xmath17 ( otherwise it stays constant ) .",
    "notice that ( [ eq : allee ] ) recovers ( [ eq : logistic ] ) for @xmath18 .",
    "we remark that the model ( [ eq : allee ] ) represents an intermediate case between weak and strong allee effect  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] for further discussions ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", models with allee effects have been mostly investigated in homogeneous habitats @xcite . in heterogeneous habitats",
    "we are aware of only a few studies with integro - difference models incorporating different dispersal kernels ( see , e.g. , the recent work by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now specify the settings in which eq .",
    "( [ eq : ard ] ) is studied .",
    "we consider model ( [ eq : ard ] ) with boundary condition @xmath19 , mimicking the case in which on the left of the origin ( @xmath20 ) the population constantly saturates the carrying capacity , while the population is initially absent in the @xmath21 region , i.e. @xmath22 for @xmath21 . with this choice for the boundary conditions",
    "the invasion process must be considered from left to right ( i.e. from the biological reservoir at @xmath23 to the positive real axis ) . in this case depending on the sign of the advection velocity we can consider ( downstream ) invasions with the flow ( i.e when @xmath24 ) or ( upstream ) invasions against the flow ( i.e. when @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is useful to formulate the model in non - dimensional variables . to this aim",
    "we exploit known results about the logistic growth model without advection , namely for the standard fkpp equation @xcite .",
    "the fkpp equation develops traveling fronts characterized by the propagation speed @xmath26 and width @xmath27 .",
    "it is then natural to measure lengths in units of @xmath28 , time in units of the inverse growth rate in the favorable patches @xmath29 , and the advection velocity in units of @xmath30 .",
    "we thus define the non - dimensional variables @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . dropping the primes , eq .  ( [ eq : ard ] ) made non - dimensional reads @xmath34 the factor @xmath35 in the advection term results from our choice to fix @xmath36 as the non - dimensional propagation speed in the homogeneous fkpp system .",
    "we can now introduce @xmath37 which is the death over growth rate ratio , and @xmath38 which are the non - dimensional sizes of the patches ( @xmath39 ) . in this way , with reference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : react_hetero ] ) we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the logistic model , while with an allee effect it becomes @xmath42",
    "we now present the basic phenomenology of the model , discussing also the main differences between logistic and allee effect growth models .",
    "a successful invasion implies the development , far from the boundary , of a traveling front , characterized by a stationary and spatially periodic bulk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]a ) .",
    "in such a case the total population in the invaded habitat , @xmath43 , asymptotically increases linearly with time ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]a ) .",
    "faster growing populations mean more effective invasions .",
    "conversely , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]c shows a typical case of unsuccessful invasion : no traveling front develops and the total population remains bounded in the limit of long times ( compare the insets in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure1]a and  [ fig : figure1]c ) .    for positive advection velocities , the problem of identifying the conditions for successful invasions",
    "is directly related to determining under which conditions eq .",
    "( [ eq : ard - nd ] ) with ( [ eq : react - nd ] ) in a finite system ( of size @xmath44 with @xmath45 integer ) with periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath46 ) admits a non - vanishing stationary solution , starting from a generic non - zero initial condition .",
    "this is clearly shown by the perfect superposition of the bulk of the traveling front with the stationary solution of the periodic boundary condition problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b ) .",
    "the reason for this link is that the bulk region of the traveling front ( which is stationary and spatially periodic ) satisfies the same boundary value problem of the finite system with periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "therefore , to determine whether downstream invasions are successful it is enough to study whether persistence is possible in the finite system with periodic bc .",
    "conversely , an unsuccessful invasion implies that in the finite system the population goes extinct , exponentially in time ( inset of fig.[fig : figure1]d ) .",
    "as we will see in the following , for small patch sizes , the qualitative behavior of the different growth models is very similar : invasions benefit from larger favorable regions and their speed increases accordingly ; moreover , the presence of advection enhances the downstream invasion speed but decreases the population size of the invading species , eventually halting the invasion ( see fig.[fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "conversely , for large enough unfavorable patches , dramatic differences appear . in the allee effect model",
    ", the population can persist in the absence of advection but localized in a region of finite size , if it initially occupied that area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]c ) , being unable to invade new territories .",
    "this is quite different from the logistic model where invasions and persistence are always linked .",
    "even more striking is the role of advection .",
    "figures  [ fig : figure2]a , b show that suitable values of the advection velocity can activate the invasion of an otherwise localized population .    in the following we present the results for the logistic and allee effect model separately as the level of analytical understanding is quite different .",
    "the possibility to use the linear analysis framework in the logistic model , indeed , allows us to systematically derive the conditions for invasions and asymptotic expressions for the invasion speed and efficiency .",
    "this approach can not be used for the allee effect model , which is studied mainly numerically and with heuristic arguments .",
    "in this section we focus on the conditions for persistence in a closed system with periodic bc , which correspond to those for successful downstream invasion . moreover , when the population is able to persist , we study how its size behaves as a function of the advection velocity .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : blasius ] ) can be derived from ( [ eq : ard - nd ] ) via the transformation @xmath74 @xcite . however , this transformation changes the value of the density at the boundaries making the solution of the periodic bc case more cumbersome .    when @xmath75 , the population can be driven to extinction by intense advection , exceeding a critical velocity @xmath52 that can be computed from eq .",

    "at increasing @xmath53 the population passes from extinction ( empty symbols ) to localization ( gray symbols ) and finally to propagation ( black symbols ) .",

    "since the model with allee effect behaves quite similarly to the logistic model , also the effect of advection on the dynamics is very similar between the two models . a critical advection velocity @xmath52 exists , above which the population goes extinct .",
    "however , for larger unfavorable patches , while in the absence of advection propagation is inhibited and the population remains localized ( light gray region in the inset of fig .",

    "as it can be seen , while the population remains localized at small advection velocities , it suddenly becomes able to propagate invading the whole environment when the velocity of the medium becomes large enough .",
    "an intuitive explanation for such a behavior is that , thanks to advection , the population can now travel through the unfavorable patch more rapidly , finally reaching the next favorable patch with a density above the threshold @xmath234 , i.e. , advection enhances the value @xmath235 above which no propagation is possible .",

    "[ fig : figure10 ] .",
    "once invasion is permitted by advection , the propagation speed and the rate of increase of biomass behave similarly to the same quantities in the logistic model ( compare fig .",

    "it is interesting here to note that something similar happens if we consider a spatially dependent diffusion coefficient , as done by  @xcite for the logistic growth model . in particular , without advection ( @xmath182 ) and denoting with @xmath252 the ratio between diffusivities in the unfavorable and favorable patches , eq .  ( [ eq : ligni ] ) modifies in @xmath253 .",
    "this result tells us that a larger diffusivity in the unfavorable regions ( @xmath254 ) allows the population to propagate also with larger unfavorable patch sizes .",
    "therefore , if we fix the size of the unfavorable patch , either increasing the diffusivity or the advection , the residence time in the unfavorable patch decreases leading to a smaller depletion in population density .    through this section we limited the numerical analysis to the allee effect model ( [ eq : allee - nd2 ] ) which is intermediate between the case of weak and strong allee effect .",
    "it is thus worth to test the robustness of the above findings by considering different allee effect models . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure11 ] we show the evolution of invasions obtained with three different models of the allee effect , either in the absence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure11]a ) or in the presence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure11]b ) of advection when @xmath255 .",
    "in particular , we compare model ( [ eq : allee - nd2 ] ) with two models of allee effect , namely the standard cubic term used to model strong allee effects @xcite @xmath256 and a slight modification of the model introduced by @xcite @xmath257 the latter can model either strong ( @xmath258 ) or weak ( if @xmath259 and @xmath260 ) allee effect .",
    "the marginal case @xmath261 , for small values of @xmath234 , is practically indistinguishable from the allee effect model ( [ eq : allee - nd2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure11]a shows that with @xmath182 invasions are unsuccessful in all the considered models . for model ( [ eq :",
    "wang ] ) we only show the case @xmath262 . however , the result ( not shown ) holds also for positive ( not too large ) values of @xmath263 , meaning that also with weak allee effects the population can be localized .",
    "advection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure11]b ) is able to activate the invasion process in all cases but for the cubic model ( [ eq : cubic ] ) .",
    "the origin of such a difference is readily understandable from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure11]c where we show the density - dependent per capita growth rate @xmath264 in the above models compared with the logistic case ( the gray line ) . as one can see , the growth rate for the cubic model ,",
    "although positive , remains very small for a large interval above the threshold value @xmath234 . as a consequence , even if the population reaches the favorable region with @xmath17 , it can not propagate .",
    "in the other cases the growth rate is large enough to allow the population to grow and propagate .    concluding , the phenomenology of the advection - induced invasion is rather general in the presence of ( either weak or strong ) allee effect , but critically depends on the growth rate realized close to the threshold value @xmath234 . in perspective , it would be interesting to investigate what habitat / advection conditions ensure successful invasions for different kinds of allee effects .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to put in perspective our results on the allee effect model it is useful first to briefly recall some known results from the literature .",
    "the study of allee effects has received considerable interest in the past , with growing modeling efforts in recent years , when its importance for invasions and conservation issues have started to be well recognized @xcite . for convenience of the reader ,",
    "we summarize relevant works related to our problem in table [ tab : allee_models ] .    in the case of homogeneous environments and without advection",
    ", most studies have shown that the success of an invasion depends not only on the initial density , but also on the size of the initially occupied area @xcite .",
    "asymptotic rates of spread are typically reduced ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mostly because of the interplay between dispersal mechanisms and the reduced reproductive power at low densities . in discrete - space models ( e.g. , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the interesting phenomenon of population localization ( also called range pinning ) occurs .",
    "the presence of advection can lead to nontrivial results when combined with density - dependent migration @xcite .    in the case of heterogeneous habitats , with few exceptions ( see , e.g. , @xcite who extended the critical patch size problem to the case of weak allee effects ) , most works focused on integro - difference models @xcite , sometimes accounting also for the effect of discreteness of the population @xcite .",
    "these studies agree on the fact that the presence of allee effects combined with habitat fragmentation generally penalizes the success of invasions or , at least , slows them down .",
    "in particular , crucial for the success of the invasion process is the size of bad patches @xcite with respect to the dispersal range .",
    "moreover , the results of these models depend also on the choice of the dispersal kernel , which is typically poorly known @xcite .",
    "our results show that logistic and allee effect models qualitatively display the same features both in the presence and in the absence of advection when the unfavorable patches are not too large , including the nontrivial existence of an optimal advection velocity maximizing the invasion efficiency .",
    "however , in the allee effect case , unlike the logistic model , if the unfavorable patches become too large invasions can be halted . when the allee effect is included , in fact , if both @xmath48 and @xmath53 are large , the population can persist locally , but is unable to invade other patches , since it can not cross unfavorable regions without being too severely damped .",
    "this means that while in the logistic case the thresholds for persistence and for invasions coincide , these are in general different when allee effects are present .",
    "the same observation was made in the context of integro - difference models @xcite , and it is substantiated also by field observations ( @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "advection , however , can alter this picture : if its intensity exceeds a threshold value , the invasion process can be activated , provided that a large enough growth rate is realized at the population density when entering the favorable patches .",
    "this peculiar effect of advection , which as far as we know was not previously put into light , has obvious ecological implications for invasive species management strategies .",
    "for instance , the idea to induce allee effects to control the invasion of alien species , which can be implemented in several ways @xcite , should be pursued with extreme care in the presence of advection .    in summary ,",
    "our results on persistence and invasion in the presence of allee effects extend previous works done in the framework of reaction - diffusion models ( with homogeneous habitat ) and positively correlate also with the results of integro - difference models , emphasizing the subtle role of advection which was missed in that kind of models .",
    "in this paper we focused on the role of advection on invasions in heterogeneous environments characterized by favorable and unfavorable patches .    on the one hand , we have shown that in the presence of habitat heterogeneity sufficiently intense advection can halt the invasion process .",
    "moreover , we argued that the efficiency of the invasive process is properly quantified in terms of the rate of increase of the invading population .",
    "in particular , we found that the latter is maximal at intermediate values of the advection velocity .    on the other hand we have shown that in the presence of allee effects , advection may be beneficial to the invasion process turning a persistent but non invading population into an invading one .",
    "an important aspect in evaluating biological invasions , which has not been considered in our work , is related to the discrete nature of a population , which is made of individuals @xcite .",
    "we expect that considering also discrete effects may add further nontrivial effects due to demographic stochasticity , in particular close to the transition between successful and unsuccessful invasions . works in these direction have started to appear @xcite",
