    "the observed complexity of congested traffic flows has puzzled traffic modelers for a long time ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the most controversial open problems concern the issue of faster - than - vehicle characteristic propagation speeds @xcite and the question whether traffic models with or without a fundamental diagram ( i.e. with or without a unique equilibrium flow - density or speed - distance relationship ) would describe empirical observations best . while the first issue has been intensively debated recently ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , this paper addresses the second issue .",
    "the most prominent approach regarding models _ without _ a fundamental diagram is the three - phase traffic theory by  @xcite .",
    "the three phases of this theory are `` free traffic '' , `` wide moving jams '' , and `` synchronized flow '' . while a characteristic feature of `` synchronized flow '' is the wide scattering of flow - density data  @xcite , many microscopic and macroscopic traffic models neglect noise effects and the heterogeneity of driver - vehicle units for the sake of simplicity , and they possess a unique flow - density or speed - distance relationship under stationary and spatially homogeneous equilibrium conditions .",
    "therefore , appendix [ sca ] discusses some issues concerning the wide scattering of congested traffic flows and how it can be treated within the framework of such models .    for models with a fundamental diagram ,",
    "a phase diagram approach has been developed  @xcite to represent the conditions under which certain traffic states can exist .",
    "a favourable property of this approach is the possibility to semi - quantitatively derive the conditions for the occurence of the different traffic states from the instability properties of the model under consideration and the outflow from congested traffic  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram approach for models with a fundamental diagram has recently been backed up by empirical studies  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the approach has been criticized  @xcite , which applies to the alternative three - phase traffic theory as well  @xcite . while both theories claim to be able to explain the empirical data , particularly the different traffic states and the transitions between them , the main dispute concerns the following points :    * both approaches use an inconsistent terminology regarding the definition of traffic phases and the naming of the traffic states . *",
    "both modeling approaches make simplifications , but are confronted with empirical details they were not intended to reproduce ( e.g. effects of details of the freeway design , or the heterogeneity of driver - vehicle units ) .",
    "* three - phase traffic theory is criticized for being complex , inaccurate , and inconsistent , and related models are criticized to contain too many parameters to be meaningful  @xcite . *",
    "it is claimed that the phase diagram of models with a fundamental diagram would not represent the empirical observed traffic states and transitions well  @xcite . in particular , the `` general pattern '' ( gp ) and the `` widening synchronized pattern '' ( wsp ) would be missing .",
    "moreover , wide moving jams should always be part of a `` general pattern '' , and homogeneous traffic flows should not occur for extreme , but rather for small bottleneck strengths .    in the following chapters",
    ", we will try to overcome these problems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomen ] we will summarize the stylized empirical facts that are observed on freeways in many different countries and have to be explained by realistic traffic models .",
    "afterwards , we will discuss and clarify the concept of traffic phases in sec .",
    "[ sec : defphases ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] , we show that the traffic patterns of three - phase traffic theory can be simulated by a variety of microscopic and macroscopic traffic models with a fundamental diagram , if the model parameters are suitably chosen . for these model parameters ,",
    "the resulting traffic patterns look surprisingly similar to simulation results for models representing three - phase traffic theory , which have a much higher degree of complexity . depending on the interest of the reader , he / she may jump directly to the section of interest .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we will summarize and discuss the alternative explanation mechanisms , pointing out possible ways of resolving the controversy .",
    "in this section , we will pursue a data - oriented approach .",
    "whenever possible , we describe the observed data without using technical terms used within the framework of three - phase traffic theory or models with a fundamental diagram . in order to show that the following observations are generally valid , we present data from several freeways in germany , not only from the german freeway a5 , which has been extensively studied before  @xcite .",
    "our data from a variety of other countries confirm these observations as well  @xcite .      in order to eliminate confusion arising from different interpretations of the data and to facilitate a direct comparison between computer simulations and observations",
    ", one has to simulate the method of data acquisition and the subsequent processing or interpretation steps as well .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the consideration to aggregated stationary detector data which currently is the main data source of freeway traffic studies .",
    "when comparing empirical and simulation data , we will focus on the velocity  @xmath0 ( and not the density ) , since it can be measured directly .",
    "in addition to the aggregation over one - minute time intervals , we will also aggregate over the freeway lanes .",
    "this is justified due to the typical synchronization of velocities among freeway lanes in all types of congested traffic  @xcite .    to simulate the measurement and interpretation process",
    ", we use `` virtual detectors '' recording the passage time and velocity of each vehicle . for each aggregation time interval",
    "( typically ) , we determine the traffic flow  @xmath1 as the vehicle count divided by the aggregation time , and the velocity  @xmath0 as the arithmetic mean value of the individual vehicles passing in this time period .",
    "notice that the arithmetic mean value leads to a systematic overestimation of velocities in congested situations and that there exist better averaging methods such as the harmonic mean  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will use the above procedure because this is the way in which empirical data are typically evaluated by detectors .",
    "since freeway detectors are positioned only at a number of discrete locations , interpolation techniques have to be applied to reconstruct the observed spatiotemporal dynamics at any point in a given spatiotemporal region .",
    "if the detector locations are not further apart than about , it is sufficient to apply a linear smoothing / interpolating filter , or even to plot the time series of the single detectors in a suitable way ( see , e.g. fig .  1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "this condition , however , severely restricts the selection of suitable freeway sections , which is one of the reasons why empirical traffic studies in germany have been concentrated on a long section of the autobahn a5 near frankfurt . for most other freeway sections showing recurrent congestion patterns ,",
    "two neighboring detectors are apart , which is of the same order of magnitude as typical wavelengths of non - homogeneous congestion patterns and therefore leads to ambiguities as demonstrated by  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the heterogeneity of traffic flows and measurement noise lead to fluctuations obscuring the underlying patterns",
    ".    both problems can be overcome by post - processing the aggregated detector data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have proposed a method called `` asda / foto '' for short - term traffic prediction .",
    "most of these methods , however , can not be applied for the present investigation since they do not provide continuous velocity estimates for all points @xmath2 of a certain spatiotemporal region , or because they are explicitly based on models . (",
    "the method asda / foto , for example , is based on three - phase traffic theory . )",
    "we will therefore use the adaptive smoothing method  @xcite , which has recently been validated with empirical data of very high spatial resolution @xcite . in order to be consistent",
    ", we will apply this method to both , the real data and the virtual detector data of our computer simulations .      in this section",
    ", we will summarize the _ stylized facts _ of the spatiotemporal evolution of congested traffic patterns , i.e. , typical empirical findings that are persistently observed on various freeways all over the world . in order to provide a comprehensive list as a _ testbed _ for traffic models and theories",

    "an extensive study of the breakdown phenomena on the german freeways a5-north and a5-south by  @xcite , analyzing about 400 congestion patterns , did not find examples where there was an apparent lack of a bottleneck .",
    "this is in agreement with former investigations of the dutch freeway  a9 , the german freeway a8-east and west , and the german freeway a9-south  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it may _ appear _ to drivers entering a traffic jams on a homogeneous freeway section that they are experiencing a `` phantom traffic jam '' , i.e. a traffic jam without any apparent reason . in these cases",

    "see appendix [ app ] for a further discussion of this issue .    note that the above stylized facts have not only be observed in germany , but also in other countries , e.g. the usa , great britain , and the netherlands @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that many congestion patterns are composed of several of the elementary patterns listed above @xcite .",
    "for example , the congestion pattern observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : empdata2](b ) can be decomposed into moving and stationary localized patterns as well as extended patterns .",
    "the source of probably most controversies in traffic theory is an observed spatiotemporal structure called the _",
    "`` pinch effect '' _ or _ `` general pattern '' _",
    "@xcite , see @xcite for details and fig .  1 of  @xcite for a typical example of the spatiotemporal evolution .",
    "from the perspective of the above list , this pattern relates to _ stylized facts 6 and 8 _ ,",
    "i.e. , it has the following features : ( i ) relatively stationary congested traffic ( _ pinch region _ ) near the downstream front , ( ii ) small perturbations that grow to oscillatory structures as they travel further upstream , ( iii ) some of these structures grow to form `` wide jams '' , thereby suppressing other small jams , which either merge or dissolve .",
    "the question is whether this congestion pattern is composed of several elementary congestion patterns or a separate , elementary pattern , which is sometimes called `` general pattern ''  @xcite .",
    "this will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pinch ] .",
    "the concept of `` phases '' has originally been used in areas such as thermodynamics , physics , and chemistry . in these systems , `` phases '' mean different aggregate states ( such as solid , fluid , or gaseous ; or different material compositions in metallurgy ; or different collective states in solid state physics ) .",
    "when certain `` control parameters '' such as the pressure or temperature in the system are changed , the aggregate state may change as well , i.e. a qualitatively different macroscopic organization of the system may result .",
    "if the transition is abrupt , one speaks of first - order ( or `` hysteretic '' , history - dependent ) phase transitions . otherwise , if the transition is continuous , one speaks of second - order phase transitions .    in an abstract space ,",
    "whose axes are defined by the control parameters , it is useful to mark parameter combinations , for which a phase transition occurs , by lines or `` critical points '' .",
    "such illustrations are called phase diagrams , as they specify the conditions , under which certain phases occur .",
    "most of the time , the terms `` phase '' and `` phase diagram '' are applied to large ( quasi - infinite ) , spatially closed , and homogeneous systems in thermodynamic equilibrium , where the phase can be determined in any point of the system .",
    "when transferring these concepts to traffic flows , researchers have distinguished between one - phase , two - phase , and three - phase models . the number of phases is basically related to the ( in ) stability properties of the traffic flows ( i.e. the number of states that the instability diagram distinguishes ) .",
    "the equilibrium state of one - phase models is a spatially homogeneous traffic state ( assuming a long circular road without any bottleneck ) .",
    "an example would be the burgers equation  @xcite , i.e. a lighthill ",
    "whitham  richard model  @xcite with diffusion term .",
    "two - phase models would additionally produce oscillatory traffic states such as wide moving jams or stop - and - go waves , i.e. they require some instability mechanism  @xcite.three - phase models introduce another traffic state , so - called `` synchronized flow '' , which is characterized by a self - generated scattering of the traffic variables .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether this state exists in reality in the absence of spatial inhomogeneities ( freeway bottlenecks ) .    note , however , that the concept of phase transitions has also been transferred to non - equilibrium systems , i.e. driven , open systems with a permanent inflow or outflow of energy , inhomogeneities , etc .",
    "this use is common in systems theory .",
    "for example , one has introduced the concept of boundary - induced phase transitions  @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", the burgers equation can show a boundary - induced phase transition from a free - flow state with _",
    "forwardly _ propagating congestion fronts to a congested state with _ upstream _ moving perturbations of the traffic flow .",
    "this implies that the burgers equation ( with one equilibrium phase ) has _ two non-_equilibrium phases .",
    "analogously , two - phase models ( in the previously discussed , thermodynamic sense ) can have more than two _",
    "non-_equilibrium phases .",
    "however , to avoid confusion , one often uses the terms `` ( spatiotemporal ) traffic patterns '' or `` ( elementary ) traffic states '' rather than `` non - equilibrium phases '' .",
    "for example , the gas - kinetic - based traffic model ( gkt model ) or the intelligent driver model ( idm ) , which are two - phase models according to the above classification , may display _ several _ congested traffic states besides free traffic flow  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram approach to traffic modeling proposed by  @xcite was originally presented for an open traffic system with an on - ramp .",
    "it shows the qualitatively different , spatiotemporal traffic patterns as a function of the freeway flow and the bottleneck strength .",
    "note , however , that the resulting traffic state may depend on the history ( e.g. the size of perturbations in the traffic flow ) , if traffic flows have the property of metastability .",
    "the concept of the phase diagram has been taken up by many authors and applied to the spatiotemporal traffic patterns ( non - equilibrium phases ) produced in many models @xcite .",
    "besides on - ramp scenarios , one may study scenarios with flow - conserving bottlenecks ( such as lane closures or gradients ) or with combinations of several bottlenecks .",
    "it appears , however , that the traffic patterns for freeway designs with several bottlenecks can be understood , based on the _ combination _ of elementary traffic patterns appearing in a system with a _",
    "single _ bottleneck and interaction effects between these patterns @xcite    the resulting traffic patterns as a function of the flow conditions and bottleneck strengths ( freeway design ) , and therefore the appearance of the phase diagram , depend on the traffic model and the parameters chosen .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram approach can be used to classify the large number of traffic models into a few classes .",
    "models with qualitatively similar phase diagrams would be considered equivalent , while models producing different kinds of traffic states would belong to different classes .",
    "the grand challenge of traffic theory is therefore to find a model and/or model parameters , for which the congestion patterns match the stylized facts ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:3ddata ] ) and for which the phase diagram agrees with the empirical one @xcite .",
    "this issue will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ]    for the understanding of traffic dynamics one may ask which of the two competing phase definitions ( the thermodynamic or the non - equilibrium one ) would be more relevant for observable phenomena . considering the stylized facts ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : phenomen ] ) , it is obvious that boundary conditions and inhomogeneities play an important role for the resulting traffic patterns .",
    "this clearly favours the dynamic - phase concept over the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium phases : traffic patterns are easily observable and also relevant for applications .",
    "( for calculating traveling times , one needs the spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic pattern , and not the thermodynamic traffic phase . )",
    "moreover , thermodynamic phases are not _ observable _ in the strict sense , because real traffic systems are not quasi - infinite , homogeneous , closed systems .",
    "consequently , when assessing the quality of a given model , it is of little relevance whether it has two or three physical phases , as long as it correctly predicts the observed spatiotemporal patterns , including the correct conditions for their occurrence . nevertheless , the thermodynamic phase concept ( the instability diagram ) is relevant for _ explaining _ the mechanisms leading to the different patterns .",
    "in fact , for models with a fundamental diagram , it is possible to derive the phase diagram of traffic states from the instability diagram , if bottleneck effects and the outflow from congested traffic are additionally considered  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we will show for specific traffic models that not only three - phase traffic theory , but also the conceptionally simpler two - phase models ( as introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : defphases ] ) can display all stylized facts mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomen ] , if the model parameters are suitably chosen .",
    "this is also true for patterns that were attributed exclusively to three - phase traffic theory such as the pinch effect or the widening synchronized pattern ( wsp ) .    considering the dynamic - phase definition of sec .",
    "[ sec : defphases ] , the simplest system that allows to reproduce realistic congestion patterns is an open system with a bottleneck . when simulating an on - ramp bottleneck , the possible flow conditions can be characterized by the _ upstream _ freeway flow ( `` main inflow '' ) and the ramp flow , considering the number of lanes  @xcite .",
    "the _ downstream _",
    "traffic flow under free and congested conditions can be determined from these quantities . when simulating a flow - conserving ( ramp - less ) bottleneck ,",
    "the ramp flow is replaced by the _ bottleneck strength _ quantifying the degree of local capacity reduction  @xcite .    since many models show hysteresis effects , i.e. discontinuous , history - dependent transitions , the time - dependent traffic conditions before the onset of congestion are relevant as well . in the simplest case ,",
    "the response of the system is tested ( i ) for minimum perturbations , e.g. slowly increasing inflows and ramp flows , and ( ii ) for a large perturbation .",
    "the second case is usually studied by generating a wide moving jam , which can be done by temporarily blocking the outflow .",
    "additionally , the model parameters characterizing the bottleneck situation have to be systematically varied and scanned through .",
    "this is , of course , a time - consuming task since producing a single point in this multi - dimensional space requires a complete simulation run ( or even to average over several simulation runs ) .",
    "@xcite classify models with a fundamental diagram that show dynamic traffic instabilities in a certain density range , as two - phase models .",
    "alternatively , these models are referred to as `` models within the fundamental diagram approach '' .",
    "note , however , that certain models with a unique fundamental diagram are _",
    "one_-phase models ( such as the burgers equation ) .",
    "moreover , some models such as the kk model can show one - phase , two - phase or three - phase behavior , depending on the choice of model parameters ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] ) .",
    "a microscopic two - phase model necessarily has a dynamic acceleration equation or contains time delays such as a reaction time . for macroscopic models ,",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for two phases is that the model contains a dynamical equation for the macroscopic velocity .",
    "we start with results for the gas - kinetic - based traffic model @xcite . like other macroscopic traffic models ,",
    "the gkt model describes the dynamics of aggregate quantities , but besides the vehicle density @xmath9 and average velocity @xmath10 , it also considers the velocity variance @xmath11 as a function of velocity and density .",
    "the gkt model has five parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 characterizing the driver - vehicle units , see table  [ tab : gkt ] .",
    "in contrast to other popular second - order models  @xcite , the gkt model distinguishes between the desired time gap @xmath13 when following other vehicles , and the much larger acceleration time @xmath14 to reach a certain desired velocity .",
    "furthermore , the drivers of the gkt model `` look ahead '' by a certain multiple @xmath15 of the distance to the next vehicle .",
    "the gkt model also contains a variance function @xmath17 reflecting statistical properties of the traffic data .",

    "[ sec:3ddata ] .",
    "so far , these have been either considered incompatible with three - phase models or with two - phase models having a fundamental diagram .",
    "it is remarkable that the main controversial observation  the occurrence of the pinch effect or general pattern  is not only compatible with three - phase models , but can also be produced with conventional two - phase models . for both model classes , this can be demonstrated with macroscopic , microscopic , and cellular automata models , if models and parameters are suitably chosen .",
    "it appears that some of the current controversy in the area of traffic modeling arises from the different definitions of what constitutes a traffic phase . in the context of three - phase traffic theory ,",
    "the definition of a phase is oriented at equilibrium physics , and in principle , it should be able to determine the phase based on _ local _ criteria and measurements at a _ single _ detector . within three - phase traffic theory , however , this goal is not completely reached : in order to distinguish between `` moving synchronized patterns '' and wide moving jams , which look alike , one needs the additional _ nonlocal _ criterium of whether the congestion pattern propagates through the _ next _ bottleneck area or not  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the alternative phase diagram approach is oriented at systems theory , where one tries to distinguish different kinds of elementary congestion patterns , which may be considered as non - equilibrium phases occurring in non - homogeneous systems ( containing bottlenecks ) .",
    "these traffic patterns are distinguished into localized or spatially extended , moving or stationary ( `` pinned '' ) , and spatially homogeneous or oscillatory patterns .",
    "these patterns can be derived from the stability properties of conventional traffic models exhibiting a unique fundamental diagram and unstable and/or metastable flows under certain conditions .",
    "models of this class , sometimes also called _ two - phase _ models , include macroscopic and car - following models as well as cellular automata .    as key result of our paper",
    "we have found that features , which are claimed to be consistent with three - phase traffic theory only , can also be explained and simulated with conventional models , if the model parameters are suitably specified .",
    "in particular , if the parameters are chosen such that traffic at maximum flow is ( meta-)stable and the density range for unstable traffic lies completely on the `` congested '' side of the fundamental diagram , we find the `` widening synchronized pattern '' ( wsp ) , which has not been discovered in two - phase models before . furthermore , the models can be tuned such that no homogeneous congested traffic ( hct ) exists for strong bottlenecks .",
    "conversely , we have shown that almost the same kinds of patterns , which are produced by two - phase models , are also found for models developed to reproduce three - phase traffic theory ( such as the kk micro - model ) . moreover , when the kk micro - model is simulated with parameters for which it turns into a model with a unique fundamental diagram , it still displays very similar results .",
    "therefore , the difference between so - called two - phase and three - phase models does not seem to be as big as the current scientific controversy suggests .",
    "for many empirical observations , we have found _ several _ plausible explanations ( compatible and incompatible ones ) , which makes it difficult to determine the underlying mechanism which is actually at work . in our opinion ,",
    "convective instability is a likely reason for the occurence of the pinch effect ( or the general pattern ) , but at intersections with large ramp flows , the effect of off- and on - ramp combinations seems to dominate . to explain the transition to wide moving jams",
    ", we favour the depletion effect , as the group velocities of structures within congested traffic patterns are essentially constant . for",
    "the wide scattering of flow - density data , all three mechanisms of table  [ tab : mech ] do probably play a role .",
    "clearly , further observations and experiments are necessary to confirm or reject these interpretations , and to exclude some of the alternative explanations .",
    "it seems to be an interesting challenge for the future to devise and perform suitable experiments in order to finally decide between the alternative explanation mechanisms .    in our opinion , the different congestion patterns produced by three - phase traffic theory and the alternative phase diagram approach for models with a fundamental diagram share more commonalities than differences .",
    "moreover , according to our judgement , three - phase models do not explain _ more _ observations than the simpler two - phase models ( apart maybe from the fluctuations of `` synchronized flow '' , which can , for example , be explained by the heterogeneity of driver - vehicle units ) . the question is , therefore , which approach is superior over the other . to decide this ,",
    "the quality of models should be judged in a _ quantitative _ way , applying the following established standard procedure @xcite :    * as a first step , mathematical quality functions must be defined .",
    "note that the proper selection of these functions ( and the relative weight that is given to them ) depends on the purpose of the model . *",
    "the crucial step is the statistical comparison of the competing models based on a new , but representative set of traffic measurements , using model parameters determined in a previous calibration step .",
    "note that , due to the problem of over - fitting ( i.e. the risk of fitting of noise in the data ) , a high goodness of fit in the calibration step does not necessarily imply a good fit of the new data set , i.e. a high predictive power @xcite . *",
    "the goodness of fit should be judged with established statistical methods , for example with the adjusted r - value or similar concepts considering the number of model parameters @xcite .",
    "given the same correlation with the data , a model containing a few parameters has a higher explanatory power than a model with many parameters .    given a comparable predictive power of two models , one should select the simpler one according to einstein s principle that _ a model should be as simple as possible , but not simpler_. if one has to choose between two equally performing models with the same number of parameters , one should use the one which is easier to interpret , i.e. a model with meaningful and independently measurable parameters ( rather than just fit parameters ) .",
    "furthermore , the model should not be sensitive to variations of the model parameters within the bounds of their confidence intervals . applying this benchmarking process to traffic modeling",
    "will hopefully lead to an eventual convergence of explanatory concepts in traffic theory .",
    "the authors would like to thank the _ hessisches landesamt fr straen- und verkehrswesen _ and the _ autobahndirektion sdbayern _ for providing the freeway data shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "they are furthermore grateful to eddie wilson for sharing the data set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wilson ] , and to anders johansson for generating the plots from his data .",
    "the discussion around three - phase traffic theory is directly related with the wide scattering of flow - density data within synchronized traffic flows .",
    "however , it deserves to be mentioned that the discussion around traffic theories has largely neglected the fact that empirical measurements of wide moving jams show a considerable amount of scattering as well ( see , e.g. fig . 15 of  @xcite ) , while theoretically , one expects to find a `` jam line ''  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that wide scattering is actually _ not _ a specific feature of synchronized flow , but of congested traffic in general . while this questions the basis of three - phase traffic theory to a certain extent , particularly as it is claimed that wide scattering is a distinguishing feature of synchronized flows as compared to wide moving jams , the related car - following models @xcite , cellular automata @xcite , and macroscopic models @xcite build in dynamical mechanisms generating such scattering as one of their key features  @xcite .",
    "in other models , particularly those with a fundamental diagram , this scattering is a simple add - on ( and partly a side effect of the measurement process , see sec .",
    "[ sec : measurement ] ) .",
    "it can be reproduced , for example , by considering heterogeneous driver - vehicle populations in macroscopic models  @xcite or car - following models  @xcite , by noise terms  @xcite , or slowly changing driving styles  @xcite .",
    "for strong bottlenecks ( typically caused by accidents ) , empirical evidence regarding the existence of homogeneous congested traffic has been somewhat ambiguous so far . on the one hand ,",
    "when applying the adaptive smoothing method to get rid of noise in the data  @xcite , the spatiotemporal speed profile looks almost homogeneous , even when the same smoothing parameters are used as for the measurement of the other traffic patterns , e.g. oscillatory ones @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was claimed that data of the flow measured at freeway cross sections show an oscillatory behavior @xcite .",
    "these oscillations typically have small wavelengths , which can have various origins : ( 1 ) they can result from the heterogeneity of driver - vehicle units , particularly their time gaps , which is known to cause a wide scattering of congested flow - density data @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) they could as well result from problems in maintaining low speeds , as the gas and break pedals are difficult to control .",
    "( 3 ) they may also be a consequence of perturbations , which can easily occur when traffic flows of several lanes have to merge in a single lane , as it is usually the case at strong bottlenecks . according to _ stylized fact 6 _ ,",
    "all these perturbations are expected to propagate upstream at the speed @xmath19 . in order to judge",
    "whether the pattern is to be classified as oscillatory congested traffic or homogeneous congested traffic , one would have to determine the sign of the growth rate of perturbations , i.e. whether large perturbations grow bigger or smaller while travelling upstream .",
    "recent traffic data of high spatial and temporal resolution suggest that homogeneous congested traffic states _ do",
    "_ exist ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wilson ] ) , but are very rare . for the conclusions of this paper and the applicability of the phase diagram approach , however , it does not matter whether homogeneous congested traffic actually exists or not .",
    "this is , because many models with a fundamental diagram can be calibrated in a way that either generates homogeneous patterns for high bottleneck strengths or not ( see sec . [",

    "<S> despite the availability of large empirical data sets and the long history of traffic modeling , the theory of traffic congestion on freeways is still highly controversial . in this contribution , we compare kerner s three - phase traffic theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental diagram . we discuss the inconsistent use of the term `` traffic phase '' and show that patterns demanded by three - phase traffic theory can be reproduced with simple two - phase models , if the model parameters are suitably specified and factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered , such as effects of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design ( e.g. combinations of off- and on - ramps ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we demonstrate that models created to reproduce three - phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and associated phase diagrams , no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental diagram in equilibrium or non - unique flow-_density _ relationships . in conclusion , there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized facts of spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution , and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and data , considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of detail in the traffic model used .    ,    , </S>"
