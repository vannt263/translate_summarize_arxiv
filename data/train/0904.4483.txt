    "in the last decade the general description of quantum states , measurements , and transformations in terms of density matrices , povms , and channels @xcite , has been widely exploited in quantum information , with many applications in high - precision measurements , quantum cryptography , optimal cloning , quantum communication , and many others .",
    "the success of such general description comes from the fact that it allows one to optimize the design of quantum devices over all possibilities admitted by quantum mechanics , thus finding the ultimate performances in the realization of desired tasks .",
    "although a quantum channel can be always thought of as the result of a unitary interaction of the system with an environment @xcite , and a povm as a joint von neumann measurement on system and environment @xcite , the neat advantage of using channels and povms is that they simplify optimization , by getting rid of all those details that pertain specific realizations but are irrelevant for the final purpose .",
    "channels and povms provide an efficient description of elementary circuits that transform or measure quantum states .",
    "when elementary circuits are combined in a larger quantum network , however , the variety of possible tasks one can perform grows exponentially .",
    "for example , a quantum computing network can be used as a programmable machine , which implements different transformations on input data depending on the quantum state of the program . in some cases the program itself can be a quantum channel , rather than a state : during computation , for instance , the network can call a variable channel as a subroutine , so that the overall transformation of the input data is programmed by it .",
    "even more generally , the action of the network can be programmed by a sequence of variable states and channels that are called at different times , that is , at different steps of the computation .",
    "a similar situation arises in multiple - rounds quantum games @xcite , where the overall outcome of the game is determined by the sequence of moves ( state - preparations , measurements , and channels ) performed by different players .",
    "for example , in a two - party game alice s strategy can be seen as a particular quantum network in which bob s moves act as variable subroutines .",
    "of course , the subroutines corresponding to bob s moves are in turn parts of bob s network , so that the whole protocol can be seen as the interlinking of two networks corresponding to alice s and bob s strategies .    a quantum network can be used in a number of different ways , each way corresponding to a different kind of transformation achievable with it , e.g. transformations from states to channels , from channels to channels , and from sequences of states / channels to channels , as discussed above .",
    "in fact , if we consider networks of arbitrary size , there is an infinite number of different transformations that we can implement .",
    "this fact suggests to find new notions that generalize those of channels and povms in the case of quantum networks : apparently one would have to introduce a new mathematical object for any possible transformation .",
    "in addition , since a quantum network can contain random circuits performing measurements and quantum operations , for any transformation one would have to take into account also its probabilistic version . clearly , defining a new kind of quantum map for any possible use of a network is not a viable approach . on the other hand ,",
    "using the current framework based solely on states as inputs and outputs to describe a quantum network one is presently forced to specify all elementary channels and measuring devices in it , and if one needs to optimize the network for some desired task , then one has to face cumbersome optimization of all its elements .",
    "optimizing a quantum network without suitable tools is indeed comparable to treating tasks such as quantum error correction and quantum state estimation without the notions of channel and povm .",
    "luckily enough , an efficient treatment of quantum networks is possible , despite the infinity of different transformations associated to them . in this paper",
    "we will provide a complete toolbox for the description and the optimization of quantum networks by answering the following two questions : _",
    "i ) _ which are the possible tasks that a given network can accomplish ? , and _",
    "ii ) _ which are the transformations that a given network can undergo ? both questions will be tackled in sections [ sec : constr ] and [ sec : axio ] from two different , complementary points of view . on the one hand , in section",
    "[ sec : constr ] we will consider quantum states , povms , and channels , as elementary building blocks to construct quantum networks . the main focus will be the description of actual networks by means of choi - jamiokowski operators , and the description of connections among networks by means of a suitably defined composition of choi - jamiokowski operators .",
    "on the other hand , in section [ sec : axio ] we will derive quantum networks and their transformations on a purely axiomatic basis , by defining a hierarchy of admissible quantum maps . the physical realizability of these general transformations is proved , in a way that is similar to the unitary realization of quantum channels : we will prove that any deterministic admissible map can be physically obtained by a suitable sequence of memory channels .",
    "we call this property _ universality of memory channels _ , as it implies that , under mild assumptions , any deterministic transformation that is conceivable in quantum mechanics can be always realized by some sequence of memory channels .",
    "the case of probabilistic transformations is also considered , showing that any probabilistic transformation can be realized by a sequence of memory channels followed by a von neumann measurement on some output subsystem .",
    "in this section we list a set of elementary facts about linear maps and choi - jamiokowski operators .",

    "a quantum network is obtained by assembling a number of elementary circuits , each of them represented by its choi - jamiokowski operator . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we adopt the following convention , which appears to be very convenient for the description of quantum networks : if an elementary circuit is run more than once , i.e. at different steps of the computation , we attach to each different use a different label , so that different uses of the same circuit are actually considered as different circuits .    to build up a particular quantum network one needs to have at disposal the whole list of elementary circuits and a list of instructions about how to connect them . in connecting circuits there",
    "are clearly two restrictions : _",
    "i ) _ one can only connect the output of a circuit with the input of another circuit , and    _ ii ) _ there can not be cycles @xcite .",
    "these restrictions ensure causality , namely the fact that quantum information in the network flows from input to output without loops .",
    "this implies that the connections in the quantum network can be represented in a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) , where each vertex represents a quantum circuit , and each arrow represents a quantum system traveling from one circuit to another , as in fig .",
    "notice that such a graph represents only the internal connections of the networks , while to have a complete graphical representation one should also append to the vertices a number of free incoming and outgoing arrows representing quantum systems that enter or exit the network .",
    "in other words , the graphical representation of a quantum network is provided by a dag where some sources ( vertices without incoming arrows ) and some sinks ( vertices without outgoing arrows ) have been removed , as in fig .",
    "the free arrows remaining after removing a source represent input systems entering the network , while the free arrows remaining after removing a sink represent output systems exiting the network .",
    "the flow of quantum information along the arrows of the graph induces a partial ordering of the vertices : we say that the circuit in vertex @xmath138 _ causally precedes _ the circuit in vertex @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) if there is a directed path from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "a well known theorem in graph theory states that for a directed acyclic graph there always exists a way to extend the partial ordering @xmath141 to a total ordering @xmath142 of the vertices . intuitively speaking",
    ", the relation @xmath142 fixes a schedule for the order in which the circuits in the network can be run , compatibly with the causal ordering of input - output relations .",
    "in general , the total ordering @xmath142 is not uniquely determined by the partial ordering @xmath141 : the same quantum network can be used in different ways , corresponding to different orders in which the elementary circuits are run .    a quantum network with a given sequential ordering of the vertices becomes a compound quantum circuit , in which different operations are performed according to a precise schedule .",
    "totally ordered quantum networks have a large number of applications in quantum information , and , accordingly , they have been given different names , depending on the context .",
    "for example , they are referred to as _",
    "quantum strategies _ in quantum game theoretical and cryptographic applications @xcite . moreover , a totally ordered quantum network is equivalent to a sequence of channels with memory , as illustrated in fig .",

    "again , the requirement that the graph of connections in the composite network is acyclic is crucial in order to have a network where quantum information flows from input to outputs without loops .",

    "more precisely , as long as one is not interested in the internal functioning of the network and is only concerned only with its input / output relations , two networks with the same choi - jamiokowski operator are indistinguishable .    in conclusion , the action of a quantum network can be completely identified by its choi - jamiokowski operator .",
    "notice that , moreover , the choi - jamiokowski operator provides a much simpler description of a quantum network than the list of all channels and all connections among them .",
    "indeed , the operator @xmath267 acts only on the hilbert spaces of the quantum systems that actually enter and exit the network , and _ not _ of the quantum systems that are internal to the network .    as we will see in the following section , the choi - jamiokowski operator of a quantum network coincides with the quantum comb , an abstract object that can be derived on a purely axiomatic basis .",
    "while in the previous section we focused on the description of transformations that can be achieved by assembling elementary circuits into networks and by connecting networks with each other , in the following we take an axiomatic point of view , aimed to classify the transformations that are admissible _ in principle _ according to quantum mechanics . with `` admissible transformations '' we mean here general input / output transformations that _",

    "ii ) _ produce a legitimate output when applied locally on one side of a bipartite input .",
    "such transformations are defined recursively , by starting from channels and quantum operations , and progressively generating an infinite hierarchy of quantum maps . despite",
    "the hierarchy of transformations is unbounded , we will show that a dramatic simplification arises in quantum mechanics : the inputs and outputs of every admissible transformation will turn out to be a concatenation of memory channels , and every admissible transformation will be itself realized by a suitable concatenation of memory channels .",
    "notice that in this approach memory channels are not assumed from the beginning , but are derived on the basis of purely _ a priori _ considerations on the admissiblity of quantum maps .",
    "quantum channels and operations are the most general transformations of quantum states that satisfy the two minimal requirements of linearity and complete positivity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "linearity is required by the probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , if we apply the transformation @xmath59 to the state @xmath271corresponding to a random choice of the states @xmath272 with probabilities @xmath273then the output state must be a random choice of the states @xmath274 with the same probabilities , i.e. @xmath275 . for the same reason , we should also have @xmath276 for any @xmath277 .",
    "these two conditions together imply that @xmath59 can be extended without loss of generality to a linear map on @xmath278 , @xmath279 being the system s hilbert space . on the other hand ,",

    "we now raise the level from states to channels , and ask which are the admissible transformations of channels . again , the minimal requirements for an admissible transformation will be linearity and complete positivity .",
    "linearity is motivated in the very same way as for transformations of states .",

    "we want to stress that the approach to multiple time states and measurements based on quantum combs provides a simple answer to the following three fundamental questions left open by ref .",
    "@xcite .    1 .",
    "_ given a kraus operator , can we always find some multi - time measurement such that this operator represents a particular outcome of the measurement ? _",
    "the answer is clearly yes , since by corollary [ probcomb ] , any positive operator , and in particular a rank one @xmath677 , suitably rescaled by a positive factor , provides a probabilistic comb , which in turn by theorem [ probininst ] can be included in a generalized instrument .",
    "_ what are the conditions that a set of `` histories '' must satisfy in order to describe a measurement ? _ the answer is directly provided by the condition in definition [ definst ] , representing the normalization of an admissible generalized instrument .",
    "more precisely , the choi - jamiokowski operators @xmath678 of the histories must add to a deterministic comb , with the normalization conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ normcondrec ] ) .",
    "is it possible that there are cases of sets of kraus operators that do not lead to causality violations but still there is no actual way to implement them in quantum mechanics ? _ in this case the answer is negative .",
    "we provided indeed the causal interpretation of conditions .",
    "any multi - time measurement that does not violate causality satisfies the latter condition , and by theorem [ realinst ] this implies that the measurement is feasible as in fig [ scheminst ] .    as an example we consider the same multi - time measurement as the authors provide , implementing the measurement of the difference of the values of the operator @xmath679 at times @xmath680 and @xmath681 on a qubit , @xmath679 denoting the pauli matrix .",
    "the measurement can be summarized by the following generalized instrument @xmath682 where @xmath683 . clearly",
    ", the measurement outcomes @xmath684 correspond to @xmath685 , while @xmath686 corresponds to @xmath687 .",
    "the general theory of quantum combs is useful for many applications , ranging in different branches of quantum mechanics , like quantum information theory , quantum game theory and cryptography , quantum metrology , and finally foundations of physics .    in quantum information combs",
    "provide an efficient and immediate description of networks , which is the most suitable for optimization purposes .",
    "for example , quantum algorithms can be thought of as testers on chains of unitaries , representing successive calls of quantum oracles .",
    "the optimization of the tester for discrimination of oracle classes would provide the scaling of the performances of the optimal algorithm with respect to the number of oracle calls , allowing for a definite classification of the quantum complexity class for a wide class of problems .",
    "an example of application in quantum information is optimal cloning of unitary gates , that was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where combs were used to find the optimal physical device allowing to emulate two uses of the same unknown unitary gate by actually running it only once .    in quantum game theory or quantum cryptography , quantum combs",
    "describe all conceivable strategies / protocols of players / users .",
    "this has been already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite for protocols in which only quantum systems are exchanged , without classical ( openly known ) communication .",
    "the use of quantum combs provides a great simplification in the analysis of cryptographic protocols , where one can use the operational definition of distance between strategies of eq .   for search of equilibria and analysis of cheating startegies .",
    "moreover , quantum combs provide the tool for the analysis of all those protocols that involve quantum and classical communication in more than one direction , for the evaluation of two - way channel capacity . in order to include classical communication parallel to the quantum one needs to consider sets of non superimposable orthogonal states , which can be easily taken into account using a c@xmath688-algebraic version of quantum combs , as it is done for channels @xcite .",
    "in quantum estimation theory and quantum metrology , quantum combs provide the appropriate framework for parameter estimation , since in the actual situation it is a unitary transformation that carries the parameter to be estimated . in this case the old approach of helstrom @xcite and holevo @xcite optimizes the povm for a given class of input states , then optimizes the state within the class , and finally optimizes the class itself .",
    "instead , the quantum tester provides the optimization with a unified procedure , including the case of multiple uses , and even optimizing over all possible dispositions of the uses .",
    "moreover , as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , memory effects turn out to be crucial in the discrimination of memory channels .    regarding the feasibility of quantum combs , all the possible implementations of qubits and their quantum gates",
    "already largely explored for quantum computation are eligible also for the implementation of quantum combs .",
    "a very promising scalable implementation of quantum combs is provided by optical qubits in silicon waveguides @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to mention one possible development of combs for foundations of physics , in particular for the formulation of a quantum theory of causally undetermined spacetime structures .",
    "this suggestion comes from a striking analogy between quantum combs and a quantum realization of the _ causaloid _ of hardy @xcite a promising tool for the formulation of quantum gravity .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : axio ] we proved that the whole hierarchy of linear transformations of any order in quantum mechanics reduces to one level , corresponding to memory channels .",
    "any admissible transformation is physically achievable by a memory channel , namely a channel exploiting ancillary systems as quantum memories that correlate successive uses .",
    "we proved this feature for the classical and quantum combs .",
    "however , our proof exploits the detailed features of the theory , and it may not hold more generally for any probabilistic theory @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we proved that : 1 ) all admissible @xmath88-maps are realized by memory channels ; 2 ) any admissible map ( @xmath509-map ) is indeed an @xmath88-map .",
    "one may wonder whether such features are generic for any probabilistic theory , or if they are true only for the quantum - classical case .",
    "in conclusion , we introduced a mathematical description of quantum networks in terms of choi - jamiokowski operators , from two complementary points of view .",
    "the constructive approach is based on the composition of choi - jamiokowski operators . within this approach , it is possible to characterize the properties of composite networks by the unified necessary and sufficient condition in eq .",
    "( [ rec ] ) .",
    "the axiomatic approach starts from a completely different perspective , and defines admissible maps on quantum objects in a recursive manner , starting from states and quantum operations and rising the level to transformations of transformations , describing them through their choi - jamiokowski operator .",
    "we proved that under minimal requirements such transformations correspond to memory channels , and their admissibility implies feasibility .",
    "all details of the theory of quantum networks are explored and thoroughly proved , including properties of generalized instruments , testers and informationally complete testers , along with discriminability criteria and operational distances between networks .",
    "a comprehensive outline of applications and possible implementations of the theoretical objects introduced in the paper is provided , including the description of multiple - time states and multiple - time measurements . in particular , application of quantum combs to the description of multi - time states and measurements",
    "shows the power of this approach , enabling us to answer three important questions left open in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce the problem of classification of operational probabilistic theories in terms of the structure of the hierarchy of admissible transformations , which could in principle elucidate the peculiarity of quantum mechanics with respect to other theories .",
    "labelling hilbert spaces in this way make us able to define the operator analog of the saturated - index pairs for multiplying tensors in general relativity .",
    "when multiplying only two operators only on some pairs of isomorphic tensor factors we will use the same name for the two hilbert spaces , whereas we use different names for all other hilbert spaces      both restrictions are due to the convention that different uses of the same circuit are considered here as different circuits .",
    "notice that the situation in which a quantum system undergoes the evolution @xmath689 by passing twice through the gate @xmath59 does not correspond to a loop , since the two successive uses of channel @xmath59 are represented as the cascade of two different channels ."
