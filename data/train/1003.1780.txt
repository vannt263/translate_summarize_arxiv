    "at low redshift , the final result of galaxy processing and gas depletion in cluster galaxies is widely observed .",
    "most galaxy populations in low - redshift clusters are dominated by bright early - type galaxies , primarily devoid of star formation ( dressler et al .",

    "however , the physical processes that are responsible for the quenching of star formation and the transformation of disk galaxies to dormant spheroids over the last @xmath37 gyr are still not well understood .    to accurately quantify this evolution ,",
    "it is essential to use diagnostics that are valid and accessible across a broad redshift range . to determine the rate at which a galaxy is forming stars , the h@xmath4 line at 6563",
    "is typically used , as it is a relatively dust - independent measure of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the last 10 myr . as h@xmath4 moves out of the optical window other spectral lines must be used to determine galaxy sfrs .",
    "many higher redshift surveys ( 0.6@xmath91.4 ) use instead the [ oii ] doublet at 3727  as a proxy for h@xmath4 since it is traditionally associated with nebular regions of current star formation and is less sensitive to stellar absorption than higher order balmer lines ( e.g. , cooper et al .  2006 ; vergani et al .  2008 ) .    however , a comprehensive study by yan et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter y06 ) of 55,000 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies at low redshift ( 0.07@xmath10 0.1 ) suggests that [ oii ] emission is a poor indicator of the sfr in many galaxies .",
    "while a large fraction of blue star - forming galaxies in the sample have appreciable [ oii ] emission , approximately 40% of the red , early - type galaxies also show moderate to strong [ oii ] emission . in 91% of the latter the [ oii ] emission",
    "likely does not originate from normal star formation processes .",
    "rather , the strengths of [ nii ] @xmath26584  relative to h@xmath4 and [ oiii ] @xmath25007  relative to h@xmath11 @xmath24861  ( i.e. , a bpt diagram ; baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ) for those [ oii]-emitting red - sequence galaxies with all five features detected indicate that the line emission is related either to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or other galactic processes not associated with star formation . most commonly , the source of [ oii ] emission in these galaxies is related to processes associated with low - ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) .",
    "this result has significant consequences for galaxy evolution studies . for galaxy populations that are currently forming stars in addition to having liner activity , using [ oii ] as an sfr indicator results in an overestimate of the global sfr .",
    "more importantly , since [ oii ] probes both the star formation and liner activity , accurately identifying galaxies in a transitory phase following the truncation of a star formation event ( i.e. ,  k+a \" or ",
    "e+a \" galaxies ; dressler & gunn 1983 ; dressler & gunn 1992 ) becomes more difficult when [ oii ] is used as the sole sfr indicator .",

    "( 2004 ) within the adopted redshift range , the total spectroscopic database for rx j1821 contains 85 cluster members .",
    "similar to cl1604 , the spectroscopic data in this system is also representative for galaxies brighter than @xmath44 , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath49 .",
    "the exposure frames for each slitmask in the cl1604 and rx j1821 fields were combined using the deep2 version of the _ spec2d _ package ( davis et al .",

    "( 2009 , hereafter lem09 ) .    not surprisingly , the deimos spectral properties of the galaxy population in rx j1821 differ appreciably from those in cl1604 .",
    "while 63% of galaxies observed with deimos in the cl1604 supercluster have detectable [ oii ] @xmath23727  ( hereafter [ oii ] ) emission , a clear sign of either agn or star - forming activity , only 36% of galaxies observed with deimos in rx j1821 show similar activity , typically at lower levels .",
    "the galaxy population in cl1604 also seems to have been more active in the past 1 gyr relative to rx j1821 , as probed by the average strength of the h@xmath50 absorption line .",
    "the spectra of the cl1604 supercluster members contain balmer absorption strengths typical of galaxies with significant star formation in the recent past , whereas the spectra of rx j1821 members are , on average , typical of galaxies with no active star formation in the last 1 gyr .",
    "while rx j1821 is more sparsely sampled than cl1604 , we have sub - sampled the cl1604 deimos spectroscopic data so that it is equivalent to that of rx j1821 . a significant difference in the fraction of [ oii ] emitters and",
    "the strength of the balmer absorption features between the two fields is still present .",
    "this result suggests that the variance in mean spectroscopic properties between the two structures reflects true differences in the galaxy populations .",
    "while we select galaxies with similar deimos / lris spectra in cl1604 and rx j1821 for near - infrared spectroscopy ( see  3.2.1 ) , the environments of these galaxies are significantly different .",
    "if liner - type processes in galaxies are only induced by very specific processes ( i.e. ram - pressure stripping , harassment , galaxy merging , etc . ) or are limited to very specific stages in a galaxy s evolution , there should also be clear differences in the observed - frame near - infrared emission - line properties of the galaxies in the two structures .",
    "twenty - five galaxies were targeted for follow - up observations in the two structures with the nirspec spectrograph ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 ) on the keck ii 10-m telescope .",
    "since this sample consists of a small fraction ( @xmath35% ) of the galaxies in cl1604 and rx j1821 , the philosophy adopted in the target selection was to maximize our chances at successfully detecting liner - type galaxies with our observations .",
    "our highest priority sample ( priority 1 ) are galaxies with spectra that would be classified as either quiescent ( k ) or post - starburst ( k+a ) based on the bulk of the spectral features , but which also show low to moderately high levels of [ oii ] emission [ 2  @xmath51 ew([oii ] ) @xmath51 74  , where a positive ew corresponds to a feature in emission , see  4.1 and appendix a ] .",
    "the priority 1 sample consists of 109 galaxies in cl1604 and 23 galaxies in rx j1821 , of which 19 were observed with nirspec ( 17 in cl1604 and 2 in rx j1821 ) .",
    "while 52% of the galaxies in the cl1604 priority 1 sample would be classified as post - starburst based on the strength of h@xmath50 alone [ i.e. , ew(h@xmath50 ) @xmath51 -5  ] , we did not impose an h@xmath50 cut for priority 1 targets .",
    "priority 1 galaxies that were observed with nirspec were primarily selected to maximize the total number of priority 1 galaxies in our sample .",
    "thus , priority 1 galaxies with a close ( @xmath52 ) priority 1 companion were favored .",
    "the consequences of this choice , as well any possible bias that is introduced as a result , are discussed later in this section .",
    "all priority 1 galaxies have strong ca h&k lines , and a majority have balmer absorption features , suggesting that star formation has been suppressed within at least the last @xmath3 1 gyr . while [ oii ] emission usually precludes the classification of a galaxy as post - starburst or quiescent ( e.g. ; balogh et al .  1999 ; dressler et al .",
    "1999 ; oemler et al .  2009 ; though not always , see wild et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) , the spectra of these galaxies strongly suggest a different interpretation .",
    "strong ca h&k features indicate the presence of a well - established older stellar population and are typically absent following a significant star formation event when the continuum light is dominated by o and b stars .",
    "similarly , emission from regions can mask balmer absorption features even in the case of relatively minor star formation events ( e.g , taniguchi et al .",
    "2000 ) , although the strength of the star formation event needed is somewhat sensitive to the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "the presence of these features in priority 1 galaxies suggest that they are not undergoing star formation episodes and the [ oii ] emission does not originate from regions .",
    "the remaining spectral classes ( priorities 2 - 4 ) are used to place a second target on our slit .",
    "priority 2 ( 91 galaxies in cl1604 , 5 galaxies in rx j1821 ) are galaxies that exhibit either [ oii ] in emission with no other strong spectral features or [ oii ] in emission plus strong ca h&k , but with other signs of ongoing star formation ( i.e. , at least one of the higher order balmer lines was observed in emission ) .",
    "galaxies with no ca h&k and obvious signs of ongoing star formation and galaxies that have no features in emission were given the lowest priorities ( priorities 3 and 4 with 52 and 62 galaxies , respectively , in cl1604 ; 2 and 42 galaxies , respectively , in rx j1821 ) .",
    "six galaxies of lower priorities were observed with nirspec , four in cl1604 and two in rx j1821 .    the remaining 16 galaxies observed with deimos in cl1604",
    "could not be classified due to reduction artifacts that prevented us from accurately measuring the strength of spectral features .",
    "only one galaxy originally targeted by lris was chosen as a nirspec target due to the lower spectral resolution and lack of flux calibration in these data .",
    "the one lris target was chosen for nirspec because it is the brightest red - sequence galaxy in cl1604 ( @xmath38=19.42 , _ _",
    "f__814__w__=20.84 ) , is a strong radio emitter , and has a priority 1 spectrum .",
    "the appreciable [ oii ] emission [ ew([oii])=6.3 ] present in the spectrum of this galaxy was a sufficient mystery for us to warrant targeting .",
    "initially , the selection process for nirspec targets only involved the use of the deimos spectral data . following these initial observations , we included broadband color cuts , which was used to differentiate between galaxies on the observed acs red sequence and those blueward of it .",
    "as nearly member galaxies in rx j1821 lie on the observed lfc red sequence ( see  5.3 ) , we did not apply any broadband color selection to the potential nirspec targets in this field .",
    "these color criteria were imposed in cl1604 in order to favor [ oii]-emitting red - sequence galaxies , which were preferred as targets as a large fraction ( 91% ) of such galaxies at low - redshift exhibit [ oii ] emission that is inconsistent or likely inconsistent with normal star - forming processes ( y06 ) .",
    "if galaxies at higher redshift exhibit similar trends , selecting red - sequence galaxies greatly improves our chances of successfully observing galaxies that contain a liner component .    to demonstrate the differences between the various priority classes used for nirspec observations",
    ", we use the full cl1604 deimos spectroscopy .",
    "figure [ fig : prioritycoadds ] shows the spectral  co - addition \" of the galaxies that comprise each priority class .",
    "the co - additions were performed in a manner nearly identical to that of lem09 . in order to compensate for the effects of slit - loss , the flux in each deimos spectrum was normalized to unity and re - weighted by the absolute @xmath32 magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "the differences between the composite properties of the priority classes can be seen clearly in the spectra .",
    "we also required that galaxies have @xmath53 , so that any observed h@xmath4 emission is blueward of the strong oh airglow lines at @xmath54 ( see figure [ fig : jbandonsky ] ) .",
    "additionally , we required any potential target to have a nearby supercluster member that could also be placed on the slit during the observations .",
    "this constraint requires that our targets have at least one other spectroscopically confirmed supercluster member within 24@xmath42 . because the targeted pairs are kinematically related at a rate similar to all galaxies with similar separations , this criterion adds no additional bias to our sample as we are sampling galaxies with clustering properties representative of the majority of supercluster members .",
    "figure [ fig : prioritycmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of all four nirspec priority classes in the cl1604 supercluster that have deimos spectra and the one targeted lris object covered by our acs pointings .",
    "the galaxies comprising the three lowest priorities each occupy different , fairly well - defined regions in the cmd .",
    "the lowest priority targets ( priority 4 , labeled `` k or k+a '' ) almost exclusively lie on the red sequence ( see  5.3 for a detailed discussion on how the red sequence is defined ) .",
    "priority 3 targets primarily occupy the bluest part of the  blue cloud \" region , and priority 2 targets primarily occupy the redder boundaries of the blue cloud .",
    "our priority 1 targets are much more expansive , encompassing both the brightest and dimmest galaxies on the red sequence and the bulk of the bright galaxies blueward of the red sequence .",

    "this is particularly important when comparing studies across a broad redshift range , as such quantities ( e.g. , sfrds , fractional populations , etc . ) derived at high redshift may be significantly biased relative to measurements made at low redshift where the h@xmath4 line ( or another optical recombination line ) is used as a star formation indicator .    to investigate the effect of the first bias on the calculated global star formation rate",

    "in contrast , the nine star - forming galaxies in this sample ( excluding galaxy 20 from this analysis ) have [ oii ] derived sfrs that are on average 8% lower than sfrs calculated from h@xmath4 , consistent with no difference .    since",
    "both h@xmath4 and [ oii ] are emitted by liner / seyfert - type galaxies , using either the h@xmath4 or [ oii ] sfr conversion does not accurately reflect the star formation properties of these galaxies . though some contribution to the h@xmath4 and [ oii ] fluxes likely come from regions in these galaxies , especially for tos , the  contamination \" of the emission lines by the liner / seyfert component means that a emission - line derived sfr will always be an overestimate of the true value .",
    "while the sfr will be overestimated regardless of whether h@xmath4 or [ oii ] is used as a proxy , this analysis suggests that the problem becomes worse when one uses [ oii ] as an sfr indicator . while it has been suggested that [ oii ] be abandoned as an sfr indicator in cases when h@xmath11 falls in the spectral window ( y06 ) , corrections to the [ oii ] derived sfr proposed by silverman et al.(2009 ) using the [ oiii ] or x - ray luminosity when available may be useful in properly accounting for the liner / seyfert contribution and may be preferable in some cases .",

    "typically , at high - redshift ( @xmath107 ) a galaxy is classified as k+a based on two criteria : 1 ) the presence of a strong a - star population evidenced by strong absorption in the hydrogen balmer series ( typically proxied by h@xmath50 ) , and 2 ) no active star formation proxied by the absence of [ oii ] emission .",
    "these k+a galaxies may represent a crucial link in the transition of cluster and field galaxies from blue / late - type to red / early - type galaxies .",
    "if we adopt one standard selection of post - starburst galaxies [ e.g. , ew([oii])@xmath108  and ew(h@xmath109 ; balogh et al .  1999 ] , 9.3% ( 29/313 ) of all measurable cl1604 spectra obtained with deimos would be considered post - starburst , an intermediate number compared to the extreme ends of the distribution of k+a fractions found in other high - redshift cluster populations ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 ; balogh et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "while many galaxies classified as liner / seyfert may have some residual star formation , their optical emission profiles are dominated by the liner / seyfert component .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003b ) estimated for the bright end ( l@xmath110}>$]3.83@xmath4810@xmath111 ergs s@xmath19 ) of such cases , the liner / seyfert component contributes , on average , 50% of the total [ oii ] luminosity .",
    "thus , classification based on [ oii ] is not a sufficient criterion to rule out these galaxies as genuine post - starbursts .",
    "if we make the simple assumption that all galaxies classified as liner / seyfert have ceased forming stars and that the statistics of our main sample can be applied to the whole priority 1 population , the fraction of galaxies with recently truncated starburts [ ew(h@xmath109 ] in the deimos cl1604 sample increases to 18.8% ( 59/313 ) .",
    "this result suggests that using traditional definitions of the k+a classification _ severely undercounts galaxies that have recently ended their star formation activity , perhaps by as much as @xmath350%_. this value is only a rough estimate due to the over - simplified nature of the assumption ( especially true for tos ) .",
    "a more thorough investigation of the star formation histories of galaxies with liner / seyfert - like properties using stellar synthesis modeling is necessary to fully quantify the effect of h@xmath50-strong liner / seyfert galaxies on post - starburst selection .",
    "priority 1 galaxies , of which some fraction are liner / seyfert  post - starburst \" , have a larger range of colors ( i.e. , both redder and bluer ) and absolute magnitudes than populations of  traditional \" k+a galaxies found in clusters ( e.g. , poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; dressler et al .  1999",
    "; see figure [ fig : prioritycmd ] ) .",
    "this disparity suggests that the liner / seyferts in our sample also represent a different class of post - starburst galaxy and may have different star formation histories and progenitors than their more traditional counterparts .",
    "the models of poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which attempted to identify the progenitors of traditional k+a galaxies , relied heavily on the observed magnitude and color distribution of various spectral types .",
    "including liner / seyfert post - starburst galaxies in such post - starburst samples would skew the overall color - magnitude distribution to redder colors and brighter magnitudes .",
    "the relationship of liner / seyfert post - starburst galaxies to their traditional counterparts is not clear from these data .",
    "the fact that red priority 1 galaxies show a much higher fraction of liner / seyfert galaxies than their blue counterparts strongly suggest that these populations lie at different stages in their evolutionary history . the red priority",
    "1 galaxies ( of which @xmath385% are liner / seyfert ) also have balmer absorption features that are , on average , weaker than their blue counterparts ( of which @xmath333% are liner / seyfert ) , suggesting that the time since the truncation of the star formation event is , on average , less for blue liner / seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , since we can not discriminate between liner / seyfert emission and emission from a to ( the latter having ongoing star formation ) , whether or not the liner / seyfert mechanism is instrumental in the cessation or prevention of further star formation activity or whether it simply turns on after star formation has already been truncated by another process is not clear .",
    "this connection will be further investigated in a follow - up paper using multi - wavelength data to constrain the relative ages of the stellar populations in traditional post - starburst and liner / seyfert post - starburst galaxies .",
    "what is clear from our data , however , is that the liner / seyfert population in high - redshift clusters represents a substantial fraction of galaxies that are post - starburst or post - star - forming .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a clear picture of galaxy evolution and to effectively link various populations in large surveys of galaxies it is necessary to account for contributions from liner / seyfert galaxies .",
    "in this study we have identified a population of [ oii]-emitting , absorption - line dominated galaxies in high - redshift clusters that are primarily powered by liner or seyfert activity as evidenced by their optical and nir spectroscopy . of the 486 galaxies in the cl1604 supercluster ( @xmath0 ) and the x - ray selected cluster rx j1821 ( @xmath1 ) for which we have obtained optical spectroscopy , 25 galaxies were selected for follow - up nirspec _ j_-band spectra .",
    "these galaxies were primarily selected to be a representative sample of a population of cluster galaxies that have optical spectra that exhibits moderately strong [ oii ] emission with no other spectral indicators of current star formation , as well as strong absorption - line features indicative of a well - established older stellar population .",
    "galaxies with these spectral properties ( which we have termed  priority 1 \" ) make up a third of the population in both structures .",
    "the main results of this investigation are given below :    * we find that nearly half ( @xmath347% ) of the [ oii]-emitting , absorption - line dominated galaxies in this study have high levels of [ oii ] emission relative to the amount of h@xmath4 emission . *",
    "nearly all of galaxies with high levels of [ oii ] emisssion relative to h@xmath4 and a majority ( @xmath368% ) of the targeted [ oii]-emitting , absorption - line dominated galaxies have emission profiles dominated by a liner or seyfert component ( referred to as liner / seyfert ) , primarily revealed by the flux ratio of h@xmath4 and [ nii ] @xmath26584 .",
    "* this liner / seyfert fraction has a strong dependence on color ; @xmath385% of targeted [ oii]-emitting , absorption - line dominated galaxies on the red sequence of the two structures have dominant liner or seyfert components as compared with only 33% of blue galaxies . *",
    "the bulk of our liner / seyfert population have observed ew([oii])/ew(h@xmath4 ) values significantly higher than unity , suggesting that a majority of these galaxies are powered by liner and not seyfert emission .",
    "the remainder are either powered by seyfert emission or undergoing a transition phase in which both liner / seyfert and ongoing star - forming activity is occurring . * in addition to being primarily red in color , galaxies powered by liner or seyfert emission are almost exclusively compact early - type galaxies , contrasting sharply with the late - type morphologies of the star - forming galaxies observed in our sample . * the lower limit to the average extinction corrected _",
    "l_([oii])/_l_(h@xmath4 ) in galaxies classified as liner / seyfert in our cl1604 sample is 1.51@xmath230.28 , higher than that of star - forming galaxies at low redshift ( i.e. , 1.2 ; kewley et al .",
    "2004 ) and that of the average star - forming galaxy observed in our sample ( 1.04@xmath230.27 ) .",
    "we investigate various extinction schemes and metallicity differences in the samples and determine that the high levels of [ oii ] luminosity relative to h@xmath4 in liner / seyfert galaxies are not due to dust or metallicity effects and are rather the result of emission from the liner / seyfert itself .    from the statistical properties of this sample we use the color distribution and prevalence of [ oii]-emitting , absorption - line dominated galaxies in our entire cl1604 and rx j1821 deimos database to determine the fraction of cluster galaxies at high redshift that contain a liner / seyfert component . for galaxies with stellar masses equal to or greater than our stellar mass limit ( roughly @xmath112 )",
    "we estimate that @xmath113 of galaxies in these structures contain a liner / seyfert component .",
    "additionally , the fraction of galaxies on the red - sequence that have appreciable [ oii ] emission ( most of which is likely due to a liner or seyfert ) is @xmath354% in both structures , similar to the fraction observed in red sdss galaxies at low redshift . since these two systems are in significantly different dynamical stages , these results imply that whatever mechanism is powering the emission in these galaxies is active for much longer than the dynamical timescale of the clusters and is not sensitive to the global environment in which a galaxy resides .",
    "we have established that a large fraction of high - redshift galaxies , especially those on the red sequence , have [ oii ] emission directly resulting from a process unrelated to star formation .",
    "this result has significant consequences for surveys of high - redshift galaxies that use [ oii ] as a star formation indicator .",
    "the global star formation rate as calculated from the extinction corrected [ oii ] line luminosity for the liner / seyfert galaxies is significantly higher than the same quantity derived from the h@xmath4 feature , itself an over - estimate of the actual sfr ( due to h@xmath4 flux originating from the liner / seyfert component ) .",
    "we conclude that high - redshift galaxy surveys that rely on [ oii ] as an sfr indicator will be non - negligibly biased by liner / seyfert activity .",
    "while other recombination lines ( e.g. , h@xmath4 , h@xmath11 ) provide better estimates of the instantaneous sfr than [ oii ] when observable , the problem of residual liner / seyfert flux still remains .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the liner / seyfert population on the selection of transititory  post - starburst \" galaxies , a population that is of considerable interest for many cluster and field evolutionary studies .",
    "we find that including h@xmath50 strong liner / seyfert galaxies increases the percentage of post - starburst galaxies in the two structures to 18.8% , more than double the 9.3% obtained using traditional selection methods .",
    "while some liner / seyfert galaxies likely still have some residual star formation , the requirement that [ oii ] be absent for a galaxy to be classified as post - starburst is too conservative and will result in a post - starburst sample that is severely incomplete . due to the prevalence of liner / seyfert activity across a large range of environments at both high and low redshift , we conclude that liner / seyferts must be carefully accounted for when interpreting post - starburst populations in the context of galaxy evolution .",

    ", , 466 , 104      in order to measure the rest - frame ew , the wavelength values of each observed - frame spectrum are divided by ( 1+@xmath41 ) . in all cases",
    "the deimos / lris redshift is used . in most cases",
    "there were no significant differences between the nirspec and deimos redshifts , and the maximal offsets of @xmath114 ( @xmath115v@xmath116 km s@xmath19 ) have little effect on the ew measurement .",
    "line - fitting ew measurements were performed for all deimos spectra , as our entire nirspec sample had [ oii ] lines detected at a significance of greater than 3@xmath55 . for these spectra ,",
    "we fit a double gaussian model plus a linear continuum to the 3726  and 3729  [ oii ] doublet , which is typically resolved by the deimos 1200 l mm@xmath19 grating . in cases",
    "where the [ oii ] doublet was not resolved a double gaussian model was still used . as these measurements were done in the rest frame ,",
    "the two gaussians were fixed to a separation of 2.8 .",
    "thus , the model contained seven free parameters , two to characterize the linear continuum , four to characterize the fwhm and amplitude of each gaussian , and a single parameter defining the mean wavelength of the blueward gaussian .",
    "for nirspec data , we fit only those spectra where both h@xmath4 and [ nii ] were detected at greater than 3@xmath55 .",
    "again , we use a seven parameter double gaussian plus linear continuum to fit h@xmath4 and [ nii ] , with a fixed separation of 20.6 . as noted in the text ( see  4.1 ) , adding a third gaussian to account for the blueward [ nii ] @xmath26548  feature had a negligible effect on the ew measurements . in all cases where fitting was used to determine ews ,",
    "errors were estimated from the covariance matrix of the fit .",
    "bandpass measurements were performed by defining two  continuum \" bandpasses , slightly blueward and redward of the spectral feature , which are used to estimate the stellar continuum across the emission feature . an additional  feature",
    "\" bandpass is defined to encompass the spectral line .",
    "a @xmath117 minimization to the linear continuum terms was performed over the two continuum bandpasses .",
    "any pixels with large variance values ( typically from bright sky features ) were removed from the continuum bandpasses .",
    "we do not remove similar pixels in the feature bandpass .",
    "the ew is defined as :      where f@xmath119 is the flux in the @xmath120th pixel in the feature bandpass , @xmath121 is the continuum flux in the @xmath120th pixel over the same bandpass , and @xmath122 is the restframe pixel scale of the spectrum ( in   pixel@xmath19 ) .",
    "errors in the ew were derived using a combination of poisson errors on the spectral feature and the covariance matrix of the linear continuum fit and are given by ( bohlin et al .",
    "1983 ) :      bandpasses were initially chosen to be ",
    "standard \" , using the bandpasses of fisher et al .",

    "these bandpasses were then modified by eye for each galaxy spectrum to avoid poorly subtracted airglow lines and to avoid  contaminate \" features near the spectral lines of interest ( primarily higher order balmer lines when measuring [ oii ] ) .    for high s / n spectral features ,",
    "line - fitting techniques generally gave more accurate values and smaller errors for the ew , as noise in the data has a relatively small effect on the overall fit ( goto et al .",
    "2003 ; y06 ; tremonti et al.2004 ) . for lower s",
    "/ n lines bandpass measurements generally led to more accurate results ( goto et al .",

    "many of the spectral features that we are measuring ( especially in the nirspec data ) have pixel s / n @xmath125 , and these data can be severely affected by over- or under - subtracted skylines .",
    "therefore , we chose the ew measurements derived from bandpass techniques for a majority of ews . in all cases where",
    "measurements of the [ oii ] , h@xmath4 , and [ nii ] features were made using both techniques the two methods agreed within the errors for high s / n features . only at low s",
    "/ n , when the line - fitting technique began to fail , did the ew measurement differ appreciably between the two methods .      the problem of extinction correction in this data set is complicated by the nature of our sample .",
    "many conventional correction methods , such as those mentioned in section  4.2.3 , are made assuming the dominant contribution to the recombination lines comes from regions rather than liners or seyferts .",
    "as many of the galaxies in our sample contain either dominant liner / seyfert emission or a linear combination of liner / seyfert and star formation activity , assumptions such as a mean balmer decrement or average observed [ oii]/h@xmath4 ratios are not necessarily valid for our sample . while we adopt a constant extinction value of @xmath58=0.3 for our data ( see  4.2.3 ) , we report here on the three methods that were used to constrain our choice of @xmath58=0.3 and to justify its use .",
    "extinction estimates from the 24@xmath30 m data were made by comparing the sfr calculated through a linear combination of the observed h@xmath4 and 24@xmath30 m luminosities using the formula of calzetti et al .",
    "this value is compared with the value of the sfr measured using h@xmath4 alone . _",
    "k_-corrections from the observed mips luminosity to the rest - frame 24@xmath30 m were derived using the templates of chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) .",
    "for the six galaxies with 24@xmath30 m detections in the cl1604 nirspec sample , the @xmath58 values range from @xmath58=0.15 to 0.71 , with a mean of 0.32@xmath230.09 .",
    "the second method is based on absolute _",
    "b_-band magnitudes , which are estimated by _ k_-correcting the observed i@xmath33 magnitude ( nearly identical to the johnson _",
    "b _ band at the supercluster redshift ) of each cl1604 nirspec target .",
    "extinction values were generated using the argence & lamareille ( 2009 ) adaptation of the best - fit @xmath124 relationship of moustakas et al .",

    "the third estimate of extinction was derived from synthetic stellar template fits to the optical / ir sed using the le phare ( arnouts & ilbert ) codes with the single - burst stellar population models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) . using the redshift as a prior",
    ", the le phare code provides an estimate of the stellar mass , stellar age , extinction , metallicity , and @xmath125 ( the e - folding time of a single star formation event ) for each galaxy .",
    "the stellar mass of cl1604 members range from @xmath126 to @xmath127 ( the nirspec targets range from @xmath128 ) .",
    "our completeness limit , roughly proxied by the turnover in the supercluster galaxy mass function , corresponds to @xmath112 .",
    "extinction values were only used for galaxies that were cleanly detected in @xmath129 and at least the first two irac channels ( 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath30 m ) .",
    "this criterion is necessary as strong degeneracies exist between extinction and the other estimated parameters ( e.g. metallicity and age ) that are difficult to break without detections in the first two irac channels .",
    "the extinction values estimated for the 17 cl1604 nirspec targets that were detected in all six bands range from @xmath58 = 0 to 0.4 , with a mean of 0.24@xmath230.02 ."
