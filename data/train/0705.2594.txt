    "in recent years , chemists have constructed a number of synthetic molecular systems which can move on surfaces and tracks ( see e.g. @xcite and a comprehensive review @xcite ) .",
    "one such object is a multi - pedal molecular spider whose legs are short single - stranded segments of dna @xcite .",
    "these spiders can move on a surface covered with single - stranded dna segments , called substrates .",
    "the substrate dna is complementary to the leg dna .",
    "the motion proceeds as legs bind to the surface dna through the watson - crick mechanism , then dissociate , then rebind again , etc . more precisely , a bond on the substrate with an attached leg is first cleaved @xcite , and the leg then dissociates from the affected substrate ( which we shall call product ) .",
    "the leg then rebinds again to the new substrate or to the product leading to the motion of the spider .",
    "the rate of attachment of a leg of the spider to the substrate and the rate of detachment from the substrate are different from the corresponding rates involving the product instead of the substrate .",
    "hence for the proper description of the motion of a single spider one must keep track of its entire trajectory .",
    "this memory requirement makes the problem non - markovian @xcite and generally intractable analytically even in the case of a single spider .",
    "( we shall address this problem in a separate paper @xcite . ) many interacting spiders add another level of complexity . even if the rates were the same for the substrate and the product , the properties of the spider ( e.g. , the nature of its gait ) represent another major challenge .",
    "here we separate this latter issue from the rest : we investigate how the structure of the spider affects its characteristics ( velocity and diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "further , we consider spiders with idealized gait  the goal is not to mimic complicated ( and poorly known ) gait of molecular spiders but to show that spiders macroscopic characteristics are very sensitive to their structure and gait .",
    "we shall mostly focus on a single spider moving on a lattice .",
    "we shall also assume that the rate of attachment greatly exceeds the rate of detachment .",
    "in this situation the relative time when one leg is detached is negligible and hence the possibility that two or more legs are detached simultaneously can be disregarded .",
    "therefore the present model posits that spiders remain fully attached and never leave the surface @xcite .",
    "( this differs from the actual situation when a few legs may be simultaneously detached . )    the spiders are defined as follows .",
    "legs can jump independently at constant rates if they do not violate the restrictions below .",
    "we mainly consider symmetric spiders where we set all these rates to one , or biased spiders whose legs can only move to the right at rate one , but some special gaits are also investigated .",
    "the fundamental restriction on the spider s motion is the exclusion principle : two legs can not bind to the same site .",
    "additional constraints keep the legs close to each other .",
    "we mainly consider two types of spiders with the simplest feasible constraints :    * centipedes * ( or local spiders ) .",
    "a leg of a centipede can step to nearest neighbor sites provided that it remains within distance @xmath0 from the _ adjacent _ legs .",
    "( this threshold is assumed to be the same for each pair of adjacent legs . )    * spiders * ( or global spiders ) .",
    "legs of these spiders can step to nearest neighbor sites as long as _ all _ legs remain within distance @xmath1 .",
    "the above properties of the gait guarantee that in _ one dimension _",
    "the order of the legs never changes .",
    "the above constraints seem equally natural in one dimension , while in two dimensions the global constraint appears more reasonable .",
    "we shall also briefly discuss a third type of spider where the nearest neighbor restriction on the hopping is relaxed .",
    "for these _ quick spiders _ , legs can step _ anywhere _ within distance @xmath1 from _ all _ legs .",
    "quick spiders have been proposed and studied numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above assumptions about the gait and the disregard of memory effects leave little hope for quantitative modeling , but simplicity can help to shed light on qualitative behaviors .",
    "therefore we study in depth a single spider with aforementioned gait moving on a one - dimensional lattice , and more briefly probe the influence of the gait and many - spider effects .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ bi ] , we analyze bipedal spiders ( i.e. , spiders with two legs ) . this framework provides a useful laboratory to probe various techniques .",
    "bipedal spiders also closely resemble molecular motors @xcite and the methods developed for studying molecular motors are fruitful for studying individual spiders @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ multi ] we examine multi - pedal spiders ( i.e. , spiders with @xmath2 legs ) .",
    "we show that the spider with local constraint and @xmath3 is isomorphic to a simple exclusion process ( sep ) on a line with @xmath4 sites and open boundary conditions ; an even simpler isomorphism exists between spiders with global constraint and the sep on the ring .",
    "these connections allow us to extract some spider characteristics from results about the sep .",
    "quick spiders are briefly investigated in sec .  [ long ] . in sec .",
    "[ inter ] we show that the behavior of many interacting spiders can also be understood , at least in the practically important situation of low spider density , via the connection with the sep .",
    "finally we stress limitations of our analysis and discuss possible extensions in sec .  [ disc ] .",
    "for bipedal spiders , the local and global constraints are equivalent , @xmath5 . for the simplest mobile bipedal spider ,",
    "the allowed distance between the legs is one or two lattice spacing , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "two possible configurations are ( up to translation ) @xmath6 where we denote empty sites by ` @xmath7 ' and filled sites ( to which the legs are attached ) by ` @xmath8 ' .",
    "there are obvious back and forth transitions between these configurations : @xmath9 for symmetric spiders each leg jumps at rate one when possible , hence all the above four elementary moves happen at rate unity .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of this bipedal spider is @xmath10 to put this in perspective , we note that the diffusion coefficient of a random walker which hops to the right and left with unit rates is @xmath11 . thus adding a leg and requiring the legs to stay within distance two to each other",
    "reduces the diffusion coefficient by a factor 4 .",
    "generally for symmetric bipedal spiders with arbitrary @xmath0 , there are @xmath0 possible configurations @xmath12 labeled by the inter - leg distance , @xmath13 .",
    "the transitions are @xmath14 the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 of this bipedal spider is @xmath16    the above results apply to symmetric bipedal spiders which hop to the left and right with equal rates .",
    "molecular motors usually undergo directed motion @xcite , and one of the goals of future research is to control spiders to move preferentially in a certain direction . here",
    "we analyze such directed motion theoretically . for concreteness , we focus on the extreme bias when each leg can only hop to right at rate one . for instance , for the bipedal spider the most compact configuration evolves via @xmath17 ; the process @xmath18 involves hopping to the left and therefore it is forbidden in the biased case .    for biased bipedal spiders",
    "the velocity and the diffusion coefficient are given by @xmath19    in this section we give a pedestrian derivation of .",
    "the expressions for velocity and diffusion coefficient can be derived by utilizing the same technique ; instead , we shall extract them from more general results for lame spiders ( sec .",
    "[ lame ] ) .    to set the notation and to explain how we compute the diffusion coefficient we begin with a random walk ( which is a one - leg spider ) .",
    "let @xmath20 be the probability that the random walker is at site @xmath21 at time @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity evolves according to @xmath23 one can solve this equation and then use that solution to extract the diffusion coefficient . in the case of the spiders",
    ", however , master equations generalizing ( [ rw - master ] ) are much less tractable , and therefore a more direct way of computing the diffusion coefficient is preferable .",
    "here we describe one such approach @xcite .",
    "it involves two steps .",
    "first , one ought to determine the mean - square displacement @xmath24 then the basic formula @xcite @xmath25 allows to extract the diffusion coefficient .    for the random walk",
    ", the mean - square displacement evolves according to @xmath26 transforming the first two sums we obtain @xmath27 these identities allow us to recast ( [ mean - eq ] ) into @xmath28p_n\\\\ & = & 2\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty p_n=2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality follows from normalization .",
    "thus @xmath29 .",
    "plugging this into ( [ d - extract ] ) we recover the diffusion coefficient of the random walker @xmath11 .",
    "we now turn to the bipedal spider .",
    "we shall examine in detail only symmetric hopping .",
    "for the bipedal spider with @xmath3 there are two possible spider configurations .",
    "denote by @xmath20 and @xmath30 the probabilities that at time @xmath22 the spider is in respective configurations , namely @xmath31 , \\quad q_n={\\rm prob}[\\bullet\\circ\\bullet],\\ ] ] with the left leg being at site @xmath21 .",
    "the governing equations for these probabilities are    @xmath32    the mean position of the legs or the ` center of mass ' of the spider in a configuration corresponding to @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) is located at @xmath35 ( resp .",

    "these probabilities obey    @xmath44    where equations apply for @xmath45 .",
    "the mean - square displacement is given by @xmath46 using eqs .",
    " and applying the same tricks as above to simplify the sums , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the weight of configurations of the type @xmath12 . the sum on the right - hand side of eq .   is equal to one due to normalization . to determine @xmath49 and @xmath50 one",
    "does not need to solve an infinite set of the master equations .",
    "instead , we take eqs .",
    "( [ pn1])([pnl ] ) and sum each of them over all @xmath21 to yield a closed system of equations for the weights    @xmath51    if initially @xmath52 , then eqs .  ( [ w1])([wl ] ) show that this remains valid forever .",
    "even if we start with an arbitrary initial condition , all the weights @xmath50 relax exponentially fast toward the ` equilibrium ' value @xmath53 .",
    "thus the right - hand side of ( [ mean - s ] ) becomes @xmath54 yielding @xmath55 which in conjunction with ( [ d - extract ] ) leads to eq .  .",
    "various spiders can be assembled experimentally @xcite , including those with distinguishable legs .",
    "here we analyze the coarse - grained properties of these ` lame ' spiders .",
    "the bipedal lame spider is characterized by the maximal separation @xmath0 between the legs and by the hopping rates @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the legs , e.g. , the @xmath56-leg hops to the right and left with the same rate @xmath56 ( whenever hopping is possible ) in the symmetric case . for the bipedal spider with @xmath3 ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath58 when @xmath59 we recover the already known result telling us that the diffusion coefficient is 4 times smaller than the hopping rate .",
    "for a very lame spider ( @xmath60 ) , eq .",
    "gives @xmath61 , so the diffusion coefficient is half the hopping rate of the very slow leg .    to derive",
    ", we first note that the probabilities satisfy    @xmath62    here we have assumed that the left leg hops with rate @xmath56 and the right leg hops with rate @xmath57 .",
    "( recall that in one dimension , the order of the legs never changes . )    using eqs .",
    " we find that the mean - square displacement evolves according to @xmath63 where @xmath64 from eqs .",

    "the drift velocity is given by a neat formula @xmath69 which resembles to .",
    "to establish one can use the analog of eqs .   , namely    @xmath70    equations",
    " give the weights @xmath71 and relation @xmath72 leads to .",
    "further analysis of eqs .",
    " allows one to determine the diffusion coefficient @xmath73 we do not give a derivation of this formula since it can be extracted from earlier results by fisher and kolomeisky @xcite who in turn used previous findings by derrida  @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to compute the diffusion coefficient for the bipedal lame spider with maximal span @xmath74 . the results of ref .",
    "@xcite do not cover the general case , although a proper extension of methods @xcite may solve the problem .",
    "for the symmetric bipedal lame spider with maximal span @xmath75 , we used an approach outlined in appendix  [ appa ] and obtained @xmath76 for @xmath3 , we recover equation  .    for the biased bipedal lame spider with maximal span @xmath77 it is again simple to determine the drift velocity .",
    "using an analog of  one gets the weights and then the drift velocity is found from the relation @xmath78 the outcome of this computation is @xmath79 specializing to @xmath80 ( the lhospital rule allows to resolve an apparent singularity ) one arrives at the expression for the velocity .",
    "finally , the diffusion coefficient for the biased bipedal spider with arbitrary @xmath0 is @xmath81 this equation is derived in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "equation reduces to when @xmath3 ; for @xmath82 , the diffusion coefficient can be re - written as @xmath83 also when @xmath80 , equation reduces to the expression for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "for the multi - pedal spider , @xmath84 , we must specify the constraint governing the separations between the legs .     from each other .",
    "]      here we consider centipedes or local spiders where the distance between the @xmath85 and @xmath86 legs is at most @xmath0 . see fig .  [ local ] for an illustration of such a centipede . in this case",
    "the total number of configurations is @xmath87 since each of the @xmath88 spacings between adjacent legs can have @xmath0 possible values .",
    "consider first spiders with @xmath3 .",
    "the configurations for the bipedal spider are shown in ; the four possible configurations for the tripod are @xmath89 and generally there are @xmath90 possible configurations .",
    "let @xmath91 be the diffusion coefficient of an @xmath92-leg spider . in the case of symmetric hopping ( all rates are one ) @xmath93",
    "when @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath94 , this of course agrees with our previous result : @xmath95 .    for the biased multi - pedal spider , the velocity is @xmath96 the biased infinite - leg spider has a finite limiting speed !",
    "more precisely , @xmath97 , i.e. , the infinite - leg spider drifts 4 times slower than the single - leg spider .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the biased spider is @xmath98",
    "^ 2}{[(2l-1)!]^3\\ , ( 2l+1)!}\\ ] ] note that the diffusion coefficient of the infinite - leg spider vanishes .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath99    the above results  are valid when @xmath3 .",
    "we have not succeeded in computing @xmath100 and @xmath91 for arbitrary @xmath92 when the maximal separation exceeds two , @xmath74 .    the velocity and the diffusion coefficient can be computed for centipedes with @xmath74 when the number of legs is sufficiently small .",
    "the simplest quantity is the velocity of biased spiders .",
    "when @xmath82 , we computed the velocity @xmath100 of centipedes with up to seven legs : @xmath101 ( we have not displayed exact expressions for @xmath102 and @xmath103 which are the ratios of huge integers . )",
    "note that for biased spiders with @xmath82 one can guess the general expression from exact results for @xmath100 for small @xmath92 ; in contrast , no simple expression seems to exist for the velocity of biased spiders with @xmath74 .    for symmetrically hopping spiders , we computed the diffusion coefficient when the number of legs is small .",
    "here are the results for centipedes with @xmath82 ( the method used in calculations is described in appendix [ appa ] ) @xmath104 in contrast to the neat formula characterizing the @xmath3 case , the above numbers look intimidating .",
    "factorizing the nominator and denominator of @xmath105 reveals the presence of extraordinary huge factors and thereby excludes that it can be described by a formula like , let alone . note that at least the @xmath106 asymptotic behavior predicted by eq",
    ".   remains valid for all @xmath0 ; for @xmath82 , in particular , we have @xmath107 with @xmath108 when @xmath109 .",
    "the derivations of above results are complicated since the number of configurations grows exponentially with @xmath92 .",
    "further , the transition rates are configuration dependent , e.g. , for the four - leg spider configurations @xmath111 evolve with rates 2 , 3 , 4 for symmetric hopping .",
    "( in contrast , for bipedal spiders the number of configurations grows linearly with @xmath0 and the transition rates are simple . )",
    "all this makes the computation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath91 for arbitrary @xmath92 very challenging .",
    "the pedestrian calculation is feasible for small @xmath92 , but even for @xmath112 , the framework based on rate equations like  is very cumbersome .",
    "fortunately , spiders with local constraint and @xmath3 are related to simple exclusion processes ( seps ) .",
    "this allows us to extract some predictions about spiders from previously known results about seps , and to employ the methods developed in the context of seps to situations natural in applications to spiders .",
    "we now demonstrate the remarkable connection between centipedes with @xmath3 and seps . as an example",
    "we show that the biased spider is isomorphic to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) with open boundary conditions . to understand the isomorphism , consider for concreteness the tripod .",
    "we can map configurations onto configurations @xmath113 of the exclusion process on two sites with open boundary conditions . here",
    "@xmath114 on @xmath85 site implies that there is no empty site between @xmath85 and @xmath86 legs , while @xmath115 implies that there is an empty site .",
    "a hop to the right of an internal leg in corresponds to a hop to the left of a particle in .",
    "further , the hop of an extreme right leg corresponds to the addition of a particle to the extreme right position , and the hop of the extreme left leg corresponds to the removal of a particle from the extreme left position .",
    "the same mapping applies to any @xmath92 .",
    "thus in this tasep each site @xmath116 can be occupied by a particle , and each particle hops to the left with rate one if this site is empty ; further , a particle is added to site @xmath117 with rate one if this site is empty , and a particle is removed from site @xmath115 with rate one if this site is occupied .",
    "thus we have shown that the @xmath3 biased spider that moves to the right is equivalent to the tasep with open boundaries in which particles hop from right to left . a similar mapping holds between the symmetric spider and the symmetric exclusion process .",
    "derrida , domany , and mukamel @xcite have shown that eq .",
    "gives the flux in the tasep ; the isomorphism between the flux and velocity proves that the velocity of the biased spiders is given by .",
    "this result was re - derived by other techniques , e.g. , by a pure combinatorial approach @xcite .",
    "the ( much more complicated ) derivation of the diffusion coefficient in ref .",
    "@xcite gives .",
    "for the symmetric spider , it should be possible to compute the diffusion coefficient by using the technique of ref .",
    "this technique ( based on an extension of a matrix technique ) is very advanced .",
    "the final result looks much simpler than its biased counterpart .",
    "hence we have sought another derivation , and we have found an intriguingly simple proof of based on the fluctuation - dissipation formula ( see appendix [ appb ] ) .",
    "first we recall that the symmetric spider with @xmath92 legs hopping in both directions with rates equal to 1 is equivalent to a symmetric exclusion process on @xmath4 sites with open boundary conditions . for this sep , _ all _ rates ( i.e. hopping rates in the bulk , entrance and exit rates at the boundaries ) are equal to 1 .",
    "this markov process satisfies detailed balance and is at equilibrium ; in particular , the mean current , i.e. , the velocity of the spider , vanishes identically .",
    "the variance of the current corresponds to the diffusion constant of the spider .",
    "this variance can be calculated as follows .",
    "consider now a symmetric exclusion process of length @xmath4 with open boundaries and _ arbitrary _ addition and removal rates at the boundaries .",
    "the system is driven out of equilibrium by particles entering and leaving at the boundaries . in the bulk , each particle hops with rates 1 to the right and to the left ( if the corresponding sites are empty ) ; a particle enters at site 1 with rate @xmath56 and leaves this site with rate @xmath118 ; similarly a particle enters another boundary site @xmath4 with rate @xmath119 and leaves this site with rate @xmath57 .",
    "generically , these unequal rates lead to a current . the mean value of this current is given by ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath120 the equilibrium conditions correspond to @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we now choose the rates on site 1 as follows @xmath123 and @xmath124 and we keep @xmath125 at site @xmath4 .",
    "then , the current is given by @xmath126    the markov matrix of this process satisfies the generalized detailed balance condition given by equation of the appendix [ appb ] , with @xmath127 if a particle enters at site 1 , or exits from site 1 ( @xmath128 otherwise ) .",
    "we can then use the fluctuation - dissipation formula ( see in the appendix [ appb ] ) wich tells us that the fluctuation of the current at the first site is given by @xmath129 in accordance with equation .",
    "simple exclusion processes have been thoroughly investigated ( see books and reviews @xcite ) .",
    "hence one can extract the results about spiders from already known results about sep .",
    "unfortunately , for spiders with local constraint the mapping onto sep applies only when @xmath3 .",
    "the spider with @xmath92 legs and arbitrary @xmath0 can be mapped onto an exclusion - like process with @xmath4 sites and with open boundaries . in this process",
    "the maximal occupancy is limited , namely the number of particles in each site can not exceed @xmath131 . the dynamics is simple : one chooses sites with rate one and moves a particle to the site on its left ; nothing happens if the chosen site was empty or the site on the left was fully occupied .",
    "one also adds particles to site @xmath117 and removes from site @xmath132 , both these processes occur with rate one ; the addition is possible as long as site @xmath117 is not fully occupied ( contains no more than @xmath131 particles ) .",
    "unfortunately , this neat process has not been solved exactly but it can be studied by a mean - field analysis .    to simplify the analysis , we consider centipedes with infinitely many legs .",
    "we assume that the distance between adjacent legs can not exceed @xmath0 .",
    "we further assume that the spider s motion is biased , and limit ourselves to a ( mean - field ) computation of its velocity @xmath133 .",
    "first we map the spider onto the generalized asymmetric exclusion process with at most @xmath131 particles per site .",
    "we then write @xmath134 for the density of sites with @xmath135 particles ; this is just the density of gaps of length @xmath136 between adjacent legs of the spider .",
    "the possible values are @xmath137 .",
    "writing the evolution equation for @xmath138 and setting @xmath139 we obtain @xmath140 when @xmath141 .",
    "similarly from @xmath142 and @xmath143 we get    @xmath144    the obvious normalization requirement is @xmath145    as a warm up , consider the first non - trivial case @xmath82 .",
    "due to normalization , it is sufficient to use . writing @xmath146 and @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 from , and  become    @xmath149    these equations are actually identical ; solving any of them",
    "we arrive at @xmath150    to compute velocity we return to the original formulation . a leg of the spider moves with rate 1 if the site ahead is empty and if the leg behind is one or two steps behind .",
    "the former event happens with probability @xmath151 , while the latter occurs with probability @xmath152 .",
    "thus the velocity is @xmath153 using we get @xmath154\\ ] ]",
    "we should select maximal velocity . the maximum of @xmath155 given by is reached at @xmath156 , and it reads @xmath157 at the state corresponding to the actual ( maximal ) velocity all densities are equal : @xmath158 .",
    "the situation for @xmath159 is also simple .",
    "analyzing recurrence one finds that for all @xmath160 the solution is a shifted geometric progression @xmath161 plugging into eqs .  ",
    "one achieves the consistency if either @xmath162 or @xmath163 . in the latter case",
    "the densities are the same , and hence they are all equal to @xmath164 due to normalization requirement .",
    "the straightforward generalization of is @xmath165 and therefore @xmath166    in the complimentary case of @xmath162 the analysis is a bit more lengthy .",
    "however , the final result is the same .",
    "here is the proof .",
    "since @xmath167 , equation gives @xmath168 , which can be re - written as @xmath169 further , becomes @xmath170 using we recast into @xmath171 the maximum of @xmath172 is achieved at @xmath163 .",
    "thus the velocity is indeed given by eq .  .",
    "the above elementary analysis is mean - field as we have assumed the validity of the factorization .",
    "the answer is trivially exact for @xmath173 , and it is known to be exact for @xmath3 . for @xmath82 , we calculated velocities exactly for small centipedes , see sect .",
    "the limiting @xmath174 value obtained from simulations @xmath175 is close to the predicted mean - field value @xmath176 .",
    "overall , the assumed factorization is not exact when @xmath177 .",
    "note that a model which differs from our model only in the hopping rules has been solved exactly @xcite , but there the stationary state is a product measure .",
    "finally we investigate lame centipede spiders whose extreme left leg hops to the right with rate @xmath56 and the extreme right leg hops to the right with rate @xmath57 .",
    "the above mean - field analysis shows that the velocity of the extreme left leg is @xmath178 and the velocity of the extreme right leg is @xmath179 . as long as these velocities exceed the bulk velocity",
    ", the actual gap density @xmath180 at the left end and @xmath181 at the right end will be higher than their bulk values , so the spider will move with velocity .",
    "this occurs as long as @xmath182 and @xmath183 exceed @xmath184 , i.e. @xmath185 . when at least one of the rates is smaller than the threshold value , different behaviors emerge .",
    "overall , the speed of the infinite - leg spider exhibits an amusing dependence on the rates @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath186 thus if at least one of the two extreme legs has the intrinsic speed less than @xmath187 , the speed of the entire spider is solely determined by the slowest leg .    to determine @xmath188 we note",
    "that velocity on the right boundary is @xmath189 where in the last step we have used .",
    "equating the velocity given by eq .   with the velocity in the bulk given by eq .",
    "we find @xmath190 thus the velocity is given by or , where parameters are connected via .",
    "explicit results can be obtained for @xmath0 up to @xmath191 .",
    "for @xmath3 we recover the celebrated result @xmath192 for @xmath82 the final expression is still compact @xmath193 with @xmath194 . for @xmath195",
    "the result is quite cumbersome @xmath196 where we have used the shorthand notation @xmath197      for spiders with @xmath92 legs and maximal span @xmath1 between any two legs ( see fig .",
    "[ global ] ) , the global constraint rule limits the maximal distance between the extreme legs and the exclusion condition implies that @xmath198 . a spider with maximal distance @xmath199 is immobile ,",
    "so we shall tacitly assume that @xmath200 .",
    "it is also useful to keep in mind that for a spider satisfying the local constraint rule the maximal span is @xmath201 if the maximal distance between the adjacent legs is @xmath0 ; for the bipedal spider @xmath202 .",
    "a spider with global constraint is equivalent to the exclusion process on a _ ring _",
    ", where each leg is interpreted as a particle and the total number of sites is equal to @xmath203 .",
    "for such a process with periodic boundary conditions , a key property of the stationary state , which holds both in symmetric and biased cases , is that all configurations have equal weight @xcite .     from each other .",
    "]      to count the total number of configurations , we set , as usual , the origin at the position of the extreme left leg , see e.g. , ; this allows us to avoid multiple counting of configurations which differ merely by translation .",
    "we then note that the other @xmath4 legs can occupy sites @xmath204 .",
    "thus the total number of configurations is @xmath205 in the stationary state , the weight of a configuration is thus given by @xmath206 .",
    "let us now calculate the total number @xmath207 of @xmath208 pairs in _ all _ configurations .",
    "each configuration begins with a string @xmath209 where @xmath210 . disregarding the part up to the second leg maps configurations of the type with fixed @xmath211 to configurations of the spider with @xmath4 legs and maximal span @xmath212 .",
    "the total number of @xmath208 pairs in these latter configurations is @xmath213 .",
    "configurations of the type have of course an additional @xmath208 pair at the beginning ( when @xmath214 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath215 the latter sum is simplified by using and the identity @xmath216 thus we arrive at the recurrence @xmath217 the solution ( found by a generating function technique or verified by mathematical induction ) reads @xmath218    since all configurations have equal weight in the stationary state , the velocity of the biased spider can be expressed by the total number @xmath219 of @xmath208 pairs as @xmath220 which then leads to @xmath221 ( note that the velocity is zero in the unbiased case . )",
    "it is more involved to calculate the diffusion coefficient , which we obtain below separately for the unbiased and for the biased case .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the symmetric spider is given by @xmath222 this equation is obtained by applying the fluctuation - dissipation relation , which is valid because the dynamics of the symmetric spider statisfies detailed balance ( in other words , the symmetric spider is a system in thermodynamic equilibrium ) .",
    "the einstein relation then implies that @xmath223 , where the velocity @xmath224 of the biased spider is given by the expression  .",
    "the extra factor @xmath106 between and   comes from the fact that @xmath225 is the diffusion coefficient of the left leg ( or of the spider s center of mass ) whereas @xmath224 is the mobility of the biased spider where all the legs are asymmetric . using eqs .",
    "and we recast to @xmath226\\ ] ] for the bipedal spider there is no difference between local and global constraints . using @xmath94 and @xmath227 we find that eq",
    ".   indeed turns into eq .  .",
    "the calculation of @xmath225 presented here is self - contained ; we notice that the expression  ( [ d - global ] ) can also be found as a special case of a general formula derived in @xcite for the diffusion constant of a partially asymmetric exclusion process .",
    "while the velocity is easily computable , the diffusion coefficient was calculated in @xcite using a matrix ansatz ( see @xcite and @xcite for a more general formula ) .",
    "the result is @xmath228    for a given number of legs , the diffusion coefficient of the most clumsy spider is @xmath229 while the diffusion coefficient of the most agile spider is @xmath230 when @xmath109 , the diffusion coefficient scales as @xmath231 more generally , the diffusion coefficient @xmath232 also decreases as @xmath233 when @xmath234 .",
    "each leg of a heterogeneous ( lame ) spider may have its own hopping rate .",
    "the bipedal lame spider was studied in sec .",
    "one can find explicit expressions for the velocity and the diffusion coefficient of the lame tripod and perhaps for the lame spider with four legs ; the general solution for an arbitrary @xmath92 is unknown .",
    "lame spiders are tractable if only one or two legs have different hopping rates .",
    "below we consider lame spiders whose extreme legs are affected",
    ". for concreteness , we focus on spiders with local constraint and @xmath3 .",
    "the analogy with the tasep with open boundary conditions still applies , the only modification is that the particle is removed from site 1 with rate @xmath56 and the particle is added to site @xmath4 with rate @xmath57 .",
    "the flux in such a system was found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this gives us @xmath235 where we used the shorthand notation @xmath236 plugging @xmath237 and @xmath238 into we recover the expression for the velocity of the bipedal lame spider ; the velocity of the lame tripod is @xmath239 the speed of the infinite - leg spider exhibits an amusing dependence on the rates @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath240 thus if both rates exceed 1/2 , the speed attains a universal ( independent of the rates ) maximal value @xmath241 . on the other hand ,",
    "if at least one of the two extreme legs has the intrinsic speed less than 1/2 , the speed of the entire spider is solely determined by the slowest leg .",
    "a general explicit expression for the diffusion coefficient is unknown .",
    "there are two special cases , however , in which the diffusion coefficient was explicitly calculated @xcite .",
    "one is the homogeneous spider ( @xmath80 ) when @xmath91 is given by eq .  ; another particular case corresponds to @xmath242 when the diffusion coefficient is @xmath243 with @xmath244 given by eq .  ; since is valid on the line @xmath242 , we have @xmath245 . as a consistency check",
    "one can verify that equations and do agree  : setting @xmath94 in the former and @xmath242 in the latter we indeed obtain the same result .",
    "the behavior of @xmath246 for the spider with many legs is again amusing . for the infinite - leg spider , eq .",
    "yields @xmath247 thus on the line @xmath248 the diffusion coefficient vanishes only when @xmath249 .",
    "the behavior of the diffusion coefficient for the infinite - leg spider is particularly neat , and it had actually been understood ( in the context of the tasep ) for arbitrary @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "derrida , evans and mallick @xcite found that @xmath250 the discontinuity on the symmetry line @xmath251 is especially striking .",
    "in the previous sections we have considered the simplest possible gaits when the spider s legs can step only to the neighboring sites . in this section we briefly explore the behavior of quick spiders .",
    "these spiders ( introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) differ from previously discussed spiders , namely the legs of a quick spider can jump over several lattice sites at once .",
    "the only requirement is to stay within distance @xmath1 from the other legs .",
    "hence quick spiders can be in the same states as the corresponding global spiders , but more transitions are possible between the states of the quick ones .",
    "the simplest quick spider has two legs always next to each other ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "although such a global spider can not move , a quick spider can put one leg ahead of the other and can walk this way .",
    "its motion is completely equivalent to a simple random walk , hence its diffusion coefficient is @xmath11 .",
    "this is generally true for quick spiders with @xmath92 legs and maximal distance @xmath199 @xmath253    we also computed the diffusion coefficient of bipedal quick spiders with arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "we found @xmath254 this expression can be derived using the general formula .",
    "for the bipedal spider we can label various configuration by the distance @xmath255 between the legs @xmath256 take the left leg .",
    "it can jump to the left up to distance @xmath257 ; the corresponding displacements of the center of mass are @xmath258 with @xmath259 .",
    "the left leg can also jump to the right .",
    "the displacements are @xmath260 with @xmath261 , and once it overtakes the right leg , @xmath262 with @xmath263 . taking also into account that all weights are equal , @xmath264 , and recalling that jumping of the right leg will give the same contribution , we recast into @xmath265\\ ] ] computing the sum yields the announced result",
    "in experiments @xcite , thousands of spiders are released , yet their density is usually small .",
    "naively , one can anticipate that spiders are essentially non - interacting .",
    "this is correct in the earlier stage , @xmath266 , but eventually spiders `` realize '' the presence of other spiders , and their behavior undergoes a drastic change from diffusive to a sub - diffusive one .",
    "this intermediate stage proceeds up to time @xmath267 when spiders explore the entire system and then the diffusive behavior is restored , albeit with a _ smaller _ diffusion coefficient @xmath268 . here",
    "we compute @xmath268 and estimate the crossover times @xmath269 and @xmath267 .",
    "let @xmath270 spiders be placed on the ring of size @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the spider density @xmath271 is low , @xmath272 ; equivalently the typical distance ( @xmath273 lattice spacings ) between neighboring spiders is large .",
    "imagine that we know the diffusion coefficient @xmath225 of an individual spider ( e.g. , for the bipedal spider with @xmath82 we found @xmath274 when each leg hops symmetrically with rates equal to one ) .",
    "each spider covers around @xmath275 lattice sites , and equating @xmath276 we arrive at the estimate of the lower crossover time @xmath277    the behavior is sub - diffusive in the intermediate time range , @xmath278 .",
    "it is characterized by the @xmath279 growth of the covered line @xcite ; this so - called single - file diffusion has numerous applications @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath280 is found by matching @xmath281 which in conjunction with yield @xmath282 .",
    "the final behavior is again diffusive . in the long time regime , @xmath283 , we may interpret each spider as an effective particle hopping to the right or left with rates @xmath225 .",
    "the interaction between spiders is essentially equivalent to exclusion interaction between particles , and hence the system reduces to the sep .",
    "we can therefore use where we should replace @xmath92 by @xmath270 , and we must also multiply the result by @xmath225 since spiders effectively hop with rates @xmath225 rather than one . the term in the brackets in eq .   reduces to @xmath284 ; we can replace it by one since @xmath272 .",
    ".   becomes @xmath285 thus exclusion interaction greatly reduces the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this strong cooperative effect emerges even when the density is arbitrarily small , the only requirement is that there are many spiders , @xmath286 .",
    "the upper crossover time @xmath267 is found by equating @xmath287 .",
    "we arrive at @xmath288    thus the analogy with sep essentially solves the problem in the practically important limit when the spider concentration is low .",
    "neither memory nor the gait play any role , one must merely use the diffusion coefficient @xmath225 corresponding to the actual gait and computed under the assumption that the lattice sites are in the product state .",
    "one should remember , of course , that the sep regime is achieved when @xmath289 ; at much earlier times @xmath290 , the spiders mostly hop on the product , and therefore the assumption of full attachment can become problematic .",
    "a single spider is a self - interacting object .",
    "there are two sources of interaction between the legs : ( i ) exclusion ( no more than one leg per site ) , and ( ii ) legs can not be too far apart .",
    "is it possible to represent a spider as an effective single particle ?",
    "the answer is yes  at least in simple situations , one can treat a spider as a diffusing particle .",
    "it is far from trivial , of course , to compute the diffusion coefficient of this particle .",
    "fortunately , natural models of spiders are related to simple exclusion processes . in the course of this work we had an advantage of utilizing some beautiful results and powerful techniques developed in the studies of simple exclusion processes .",
    "our models certainly do not take into account all the details of an experimental situation @xcite .",
    "for instance , we assumed that the re - attachment of a leg is very quick , so the process is controlled by detachment .",
    "hence spiders remain fully attached and never leave the surface .",
    "this assumption is important as our analysis has relied on the permanent presence of spiders on the surface . relaxing this assumption",
    "does not make the problem intractable  indeed in recent analyzes of molecular motors the complete detachment ( unbinding ) from cytoskeletal filaments is allowed , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "further , our analysis of the many - spider situation in sec .",
    "[ inter ] treats the low density case ; the analogy with sep allowed us to handle the problem but the assumed permanent presence of the spiders is particularly questionable in this case .",
    "perhaps the most serious limitation of our analysis is the disregard of memory  in experimental realizations @xcite spiders often affect the environment which in turn affect their motion .",
    "the non - markovian nature of this problem calls for a set of new techniques even in the case of a single spider . in one dimension",
    ", the influence of memory can be probed analytically for a single bipedal spider @xcite , and the replacement of a self - interacting spider by an effective particle remains valid , though this effective particle becomes an excited random walk which distinguishes visited and unvisited sites .",
    "finally we note that the sep and its generalizations occur in various biological problems ranging from motion of molecular motors @xcite to protein synthesis @xcite .",
    "some models of protein synthesis resemble complicated models of spiders .",
    "another intriguing connection is between spiders and cooperative cargo transport by several molecular motors @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we explain the general formalism , inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , that allows one to calculate velocities and diffusion contants , and we use this method to derive equation  .",
    "a spider can be viewed as a homogeneous markov process with a finite number of internal states .",
    "the dynamics of the spider is encoded in a markov matrix @xmath291 , where the non - diagonal matrix element @xmath292 represents the rate of evolution from a configuration @xmath293 to a different configuration @xmath294 .",
    "the quantity @xmath295 is the exit - rate from configuration @xmath294 .",
    "the master equation for @xmath296 , the probability of being in configuration @xmath294 at time @xmath22 , is then given by @xmath297 we now define @xmath298 as the absolute position of the spider s left leg , knowing that at time @xmath299 , @xmath300 . between @xmath22 and @xmath301 , @xmath298 varies by the discrete amount @xmath302 or @xmath303 that depends on the configuration @xmath293 at @xmath22 and on the configuration @xmath294 at @xmath301 .",
    "the markov matrix @xmath291 can then be decomposed in three parts corresponding to the three possible evolutions of @xmath298  : @xmath304 for example , @xmath305 represents the transition rate from a configuration @xmath293 to @xmath294 with the left leg moving one step forward ( this matrix element vanishes otherwise ) ; @xmath306 corresponds to transitions for which the left leg moves one step backwards ; @xmath307 encodes transitions in which the left leg stays still .",
    "we call @xmath308 the joint probability of being at time @xmath22 in the configuration @xmath294 and having @xmath309 . a master equation , analogous to equation  ( [ eq : markov ] ) , can be written for @xmath308 as follows  : @xmath310 in terms of the generating function @xmath311 defined as @xmath312 the master equation  ( [ eq : markov2 ] ) takes the simpler form  : @xmath313 where @xmath314 , which governs the evolution of @xmath311 , is given by @xmath315 we emphasize that @xmath316 , is not a markov matrix for @xmath317 ( the sum of the elements in a given column does not vanish ) .    in the long time",
    "limit , @xmath318 , the behaviour of @xmath311 is dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath319 of the matrix @xmath316 .",
    "we thus have , when @xmath318 , @xmath320 this result can be restated more precisely as follows  : @xmath321 the function @xmath319 contains the complete information about the cumulants of @xmath298 in the long time limit .",
    "for example , the velocity @xmath224 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath225 of the spider are given by @xmath322 one therefore needs to calculate the function @xmath319 . for simple problems such as the bipedal spider with @xmath3",

    "the most efficient technique is to perform a perturbative calculation of @xmath319 in the vicinity of @xmath323 ( recall that @xmath319 vanishes at @xmath324 ) .",
    "this perturbative approach is very similar to the one used in quantum mechanics , the major difference being that @xmath316 which plays the role of the hamiltonian is not , in general , a symmetric matrix and its right eigenvectors are different from its left eigenvectors . by definition",
    ", we have @xmath325 using equations , , and , we can write the following perturbative expansions in the vicinity of @xmath324 , @xmath326 where @xmath291 is the original markov matrix of the system , @xmath327 is the stationary state and @xmath328 is the left ground state of @xmath291 .",
    "we now substitute these perturbative expansions in  ( [ defmulambda ] ) and identify the terms with the same power of @xmath280 . using the left eigenvector @xmath329",

    ": @xmath334 we observe that in order to calculate @xmath224 we only need to know the ground state of @xmath291 .",

    "we remark that similar expressions can be obtained starting from the expansion of right eigenvector @xmath336 .",
    "we now specialize this framework to the case of the heterogeneous bipedal lame spider with @xmath0 internal states .",

    "one can verify that the solution of this equation is given by @xmath346 where @xmath347 for @xmath348 inserting equations  ( [ eqpk ] ) and  ( [ eqqk ] ) into the general expression   leads to the formula  .",
    "we also used the above method to determine the velocity and the diffusion coefficient for centipedes with @xmath82 .",
