    "near infrared ( ir ) selected samples may provide significant advantages over optically selected samples in studying galaxy evolution due to the small and almost galaxy type independent @xmath14-corrections at these wavelengths ( cowie et al .",
    ". moreover , ir selection provides samples which are not biased towards star - forming galaxies and may trace the mass of the galaxies over a wide range of redshift . for these reasons , since the beginning of nineties , near ir galaxy counts have been considered a powerful cosmological test .",
    "this , however , was discovered not to be the case when it was realized that deep optical and near ir observations were difficult to reconcile without assuming an _ ad hoc _ population of galaxies or extreme merging scenario ( cowie et al .",
    "1990 ; babul & rees 1992 ; broadhurst et al .",
    "1992 ; gronwall & koo 1995 ; yoshii & peterson 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the large uncertainty on the slope of the faint - end tail of the local lf , especially in the near ir , means that the hypothesis on the nature of the very faint population of galaxies is completely unconstrained in terms of redshift and thus in terms of evolution .",
    "the addition of color information to number counts may shed light on the different populations that contribute at a given magnitude and/or the redshift of galaxies beyond the spectroscopic limits ( e.g. lilly , cowie and gardner 1991 ) .",
    "some efforts have been made to include in the analysis of faint galaxies also information about the morphological structure derived both from ground based observations ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1991 ; colless et al . 1994 ) and , more recently , from hst images .",
    "morphological classifications based on visual inspection of optical hst images have revealed that the faint field population is apparently dominated by irregular and merging galaxies ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 ; driver et al .",
    ". however , the comparison of optical images of distant galaxies with possible local counterparts could give misleading results since the surface brightness dimming and the reduced signal - to - noise ratio tend to emphasize high contrast features .",
    "also , as discussed by abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the band - pass shifting effects arising from the k - correction implies that low - redshift optical images are compared with high - redshift uv images which , inevitably , show an increasing irregularity in their morphology .",
    "most of the uncertainties related to image structure vanish when dealing with near - ir data since they trace the underlying old stellar population of galaxies out to @xmath15 - 4 .",
    "recently , bershady et al . (",
    "1998 ) derived deep near - ir galaxy counts in two high - latitude galactic fields , summing up to 1.5 arcmin@xmath1 , observed with the keck telescope to depths of j=24.5 and k=24 .",
    "they find that counts do not roll over by k@xmath16 and that the smallest galaxies dominate at magnitudes fainter than j@xmath17 and k@xmath8 .",
    "they also find no hint of a flattening in the counts at the limits of the survey and mean colors bluer than expected from a no evolution prediction .",
    "these features are discussed under the hypothesis of an increasing contribution of sub - l@xmath18 galaxies at faint magnitudes , i.e. a rising faint end luminosity function ( lf ) , and/or evolution of galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we present counts , near - ir colors , sizes and compactness indices of faint galaxies observed at the eso ntt telescope to depths comparable with the faintest previous ground - based surveys but over a much larger area . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and the photometric calibration while in  3 we describe the image processing and analysis and the construction of our photometric sample . in  4 the differential galaxy counts and colors are derived while in  5 we describe the method used to estimate the size and compactness of sources and present counts as a function of galaxy size .",
    "the discussion of the results is presented in  6 and section  7 summarizes our results and conclusions .",
    "the observational data used were obtained during commissioning of the sofi infrared imager / spectrometer ( moorwood et al .",
    "1998 ) at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) in march 1998 and are publicly available ( http://www.eso.org/science/sofi_deep/ ) .",
    "sofi is equipped with a 1024@xmath191024 pixel rockwell hawaii array providing a plate scale of 0.292@xmath20 arcsec / pix in the wide - field observing mode .",
    "the total field of view on the sky is thus about 5@xmath195 arcmin per frame .",
    "field center was located at @xmath21 , @xmath22 and observations were made in the two near - infrared filters j ( @xmath23=1.247 @xmath24 m ; @xmath25 @xmath24 m ) , and ks ( @xmath23=2.162 @xmath24m;@xmath26 @xmath24 m ) .",
    "the observations were gathered over several nights but under quite homogeneous seeing conditions ranging from 0.6 - 0.9 arcsec ( median fwhm = 0.75 arcsec ) .",
    "the standard jitter technique was used with effective exposure times for each individual frame of 1 min in ks , ( resulting from the average of 6 exposure of 10 s each ) , and 2 min in j ( resulting from the average of 6 exposures of 20 s each).the jitter offsets were controlled by an automated template procedure ( the reader is referred to the sofi user manual for more details ) which was used to randomly offset the telescope position within a box of 40 arcsec on the sky .",
    "the deepest exposures were therefore achieved across the central 4.45@xmath194.45 arcmin field .",
    "a single measurement normally consisted of 60 and 30 frames in ks and j , respectively , the whole `` duty '' cycle amounting to a total of 1 hour integration .",
    "these were repeated to achieve total exposure times of 624 min in ks and 256 min in j in the final co - added images .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since model refers to @xmath11 galaxies ( that have _ reference _ but not necessarily _ mean _ luminosity for each morphological type ) , the natural expectation , when comparing with real galaxy samples , as in fig .",
    "5 and 6 for instance , is that models provide a sort of brighter ( and somewhat redder ) envelope to the data .",
    "this is because the real `` baricenter '' of the luminosity distribution at any @xmath27 is always slightly fainter ( and bluer ) than @xmath11 , depending on the faint - end tail of lfs .",
    "even if the model is consistent with the observed color of galaxies at bright magnitudes , it completely fails to match the observed trend at faint magnitudes where galaxies are much bluer than expected .",
    "the hypothesis of a high redshift galaxy population ( @xmath10 ) dominating the faint counts is thus unacceptable . even in the case",
    "that irregular galaxies would prevail the colors should be much redder than j - k@xmath28 . apparently , the equivalence",
    "_ fainter magnitudes @xmath29 higher redshifts _ is therefore not supported by the observations .",
    "a similar relationship between color trend and redshift distribution of faint galaxies has also been found by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in their sample",
    ", they find that blue objects dominate the k counts and that a huge fraction of their k - selected faint objects are in fact extremely blue in ( i - k ) .",
    "moreover , the observed median redshift of faint galaxies appears to be lower than expected for @xmath11 galaxies seen at the same apparent k magnitude , while galaxies display a roughly constant or even decreasing k luminosity with increasing redshift at least at k@xmath30 where the redshift completeness is high .",
    "as the high - reshift solution ( @xmath10 ) seems to be inconsistent with the photometric properties of faint ir galaxies , we have to investigate the possibility of a local ( @xmath31 ) origin of these galaxies .",
    "a galaxy seen at ks@xmath3222 and placed at @xmath33 would display an absolute magnitude not brighter than @xmath34 ( assuming h@xmath35=50 km s@xmath36 mpc@xmath36 , q@xmath35=0.5 ) . integrating the local ir luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) described by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , within @xmath33 and @xmath39 we derive , in the magnitude range @xmath40 , a surface density of galaxies 20 - 40 times lower than observed .",
    "a large uncertainty in such estimates derives from the different values of the normalization parameter @xmath41 of the lf obtained by various authors which can vary by more than a factor of two ( see e.g. efsthathiou et al . 1988 ; lilly et al . 1995 ; zucca et al .",
    "1998 , mobasher et al . 1993",
    "; glazebrook et al . 1995 ; gardner et al .",
    "1997 ; cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) . using a high normalization ( e.g. @xmath42 mpc@xmath43 as in marzke et al .",
    "1994 ) the observed surface density of galaxies can be obtained within @xmath33 by assuming a slope of the faint end lf @xmath44",
    ".    some indications of a flat ( @xmath37 ) faint - end lf in the near ir come from the work of gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , mobasher et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and glazebrook et al .",
    "however , it is worth noting that all of the previous work has sampled the lf at relatively bright ir luminosity ( @xmath45 ) and thus misses the crucial piece of information to assess our problem . on the contrary ,",
    "some hints in favor of a steeper lf for field galaxies at infrared wavelengths come from szokoly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who find a slope @xmath46 . the small sample of galaxies used in that work ( one fourth of that used by gardner et al .",
    ") can not , however , place severe constraints on the value of @xmath47 .",
    "stronger evidences of a steep k - band lf of field galaxies come from bershady et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which obtain @xmath48 .",
    "evidence for a steeper slope of the ir lf are also found for cluster galaxies ( @xmath49 , mobasher and trentham 1998 ; @xmath50 , de propris et al .",
    "1998a ) and , in the optical bands , both in the cluster environment ( e.g. de propris et al .",
    "1998b ; lobo et al .",
    "1997 ; bernstein et al .",
    "1995 ; driver et al .",
    "1994 ; molinari et al . 1998 ) and in the field ] : marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find @xmath51 for the lf of very late type and irregulars galaxies ( see also marzke and da costa 1997 ; marzke et al .",
    "1998 ) ; zucca et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find a rising lf at magnitudes fainter than @xmath52 which is well fitted by a power law with slope @xmath53 and , finally , liu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find @xmath54 for the u - band lf of galaxies bluer than sbc .",
    "faced with the lack of reliable information on deep ir lfs in the field but with emerging evidence from optical investigations , we are inclined to believe that a genuine steepening of the lf at its faint - end tail can not be ruled out and that a prevailing population of sub - l@xmath55 ( and hence low mass and low redshift ( @xmath56 ) ) galaxies may dominate at faint infrared magnitudes .      from figs .",
    "7 and 8 we can infer that the faint ir population mainly consists of galaxies which are intrinsically compact compared to those seen at brighter apparent magnitudes . fig .",
    "9 also shows that the contribution of small , compact galaxies to the counts increases faster than that of large galaxies going to faint apparent magnitudes as shown by the steeper slopes derived .",
    "it is worth noting that the counts of small sources follow an euclidean slope which indicates that either they are very low redshift galaxies , very rapidly evolving or a combination of the two .",
    "finally , figs . 10 , 11 and 12 indicate that small galaxies contribute most to the blue population . _",
    "our conclusion is that sub - l@xmath55 galaxies contribute to the number counts and with increasing weight to fainter magnitudes . _    at faint apparent magnitudes we are sampling the faint - end tail of the local luminosity function superposed on the bright tail ( @xmath57 ) of the high redshift galaxy population .",
    "the relative contribution to the total number of galaxies at a given apparent magnitude depends on the volume sampled by a given luminosity and on the density of galaxies with that luminosity .",
    "a large contribution to faint counts could come from the faint end of the lf in the case of a steep slope ( @xmath58 ) since the number of luminous galaxies would increase slower than that of the intrinsically faint ones at faint apparent magnitudes . in this case",
    "we should first observe a reddening trend of the j - k color due to the rapid increase of galaxies with progressively higher redshift going to fainter apparent magnitudes .",
    "such a trend would be expected to continue steadily as long as the number of intrinsically faint galaxies , and hence low redshift galaxies , starts to increase more rapidly than high-@xmath27 galaxies .",
    "the mean observed color should therefore become increasingly bluer , contrary to what is expected for the standard case of a normal high-@xmath27 galaxy population .",
    "moreover , the median redshift would increase more slowly than expected going to fainter apparent magnitudes , as observed by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in their redshift survey .",
    "for example , assuming a slope @xmath59 at luminosities @xmath13 , as in the esp ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) , by integrating the lf down to 0.0001@xmath11 we find that more than 40@xmath60 of the galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath40 are at @xmath61 and more than 60@xmath60 at @xmath56 .",
    "these fractions could even increase to 60@xmath60 and 80@xmath60 in the case of a steeper lf , for example according to the result of marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1998 ) or de propris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , or integrating the lf down to a fainter cutoff .",
    "it is worth noting that this simple scenario , which is a straightforward consequence of a steepening trend in the lf faint - end tail , would also account for the observed trend in galaxy size and compactness parameter , as discussed earlier . assuming that faint galaxies are actually intrinsically faint ir objects and that the ir luminosity is also a fair tracer of mass ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 ) implies that compact systems of low mass constitute an important population in the universe at least back to @xmath62 .",
    "we have presented counts , colors and sizes of galaxies detected in deep j ( down to j=24 ) and ks ( down to ks=22.5 ) images obtained with the new ir imager / spectrometer sofi at the eso ntt telescope .",
    "these data represent the largest samples collected so far reaching these depths .",
    "the main results obtained from analysis of the data are the following :    * number counts follow a @xmath63 relation with slope 0.38 in ks and 0.36 in j showing no sign of any flattening or turnover down to the faintest magnitudes .",
    "this fully agrees with most of the previous ground - based data and with the deepest nicmos / hst data ; * fainter than ks@xmath9 and j@xmath0 , the median j - k galaxy color shows a break in its reddening trend and turns toward bluer colors ; * faint bluer galaxies display both a larger compactness index and smaller apparent sizes ; * the j - k color distribution of small and of large galaxies ( selected with respect to the median size of the whole sample ) are significantly different with small galaxies contributing most to the blue population ; * the number counts of small galaxies follow an euclidean slope , much steeper than that of large sources , and dominate the deep number counts fainter than ks=21.5 and j=23 .",
    "the absence of a turnover in the counts down to the faintest magnitudes is indicative of an increasing contribution of sub - l@xmath18 and thus low redshift galaxies ( @xmath56 ) leading to envisage a substantial steepening in the faint - end tail of the galaxy lf .",
    "such a claim is also supported by the observed color trend which seems to rule out any major contribution of high-@xmath27 galaxies as primary contributors to faint counts .",
    "moreover also the euclidean slope shown by counts of small galaxies supports this claim .",
    "in particular the euclidean slope indicates that either small galaxies are at very low redshift , or that they are very rapidly evolving or a combination of the two .",
    "the existence of a steep ( @xmath12 ) faint - end tail ( @xmath64 ) in the ir lf would naturally account both for the j - k color trend , the compactness trend and the different slope shown by the counts of small and large galaxies , the former being described by a much steeper ( nearly euclidean ) slope .",
    "very little is known about the redshift distribution of galaxies to faint k magnitudes . two spectroscopic surveys , cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on a k=20 limited sample have been carried out so far .",
    "taking into account their redshift incompleteness , it seems that 10 - 30@xmath60 of objects are at @xmath10 .",
    "the population we are discussing here is concentrated at k@xmath65 .",
    "it will prove quite difficult to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for these objects since their @xmath66 magnitudes should be fainter than 24 and obtaining ir spectra would be equally difficult even using an ir spectrometer like isaac at the vlt . the most promising approach to understand the properties of the faint population is the use of photometric redshifts based on color measurements from the u to k bands ( fontana et al .",

    "<S> fainter than @xmath7 and ks@xmath8 , small sources dominate the number counts . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies get redder in j - k down to j@xmath0 and ks@xmath9 . at fainter magnitudes , </S>",
    "<S> the median color becomes bluer with an accompanying increase in the compactness of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the blue , small sources which dominate the faint ir counts are not compatible with a high redshift ( @xmath10 ) population . on the contrary , the observed color and compactness trends , together with the absence of a turnover at faint magnitudes and the dominance of small sources , </S>",
    "<S> can be naturally explained by an increasing contribution of sub-@xmath11 galaxies when going to fainter apparent magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> such evidence strongly supports the existence of a steeply rising ( @xmath12 ) faint end of the local infrared luminosity function of galaxies - at least for luminosities @xmath13 . </S>"
