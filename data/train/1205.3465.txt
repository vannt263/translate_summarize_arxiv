    "the improved control over systems of intrinsic complexity makes the implementation of techniques for the inference of specific properties of their states a necessary step towards the achievement of full quantum control .",

    "this agenda is dressed of even more relevance due to the recent experimental efforts produced towards the quantum - limited management of mesoscopic systems , such as superconducting devices  @xcite , light - interfaced cold - atom systems  @xcite and mechanical systems operating at the quantum level  @xcite .",

    "the quantum - interface paradigm is indeed very fruitful for the extraction of information out of a system that is only partially accessible : through the coupling with a controllable subsystem , one can indeed arrange for mechanisms able to provide useful knowledge on key features of a dynamics or a state .",
    "examples of such a possibility , which have been materialised in successful experimental demonstrations , include the micro - maser technology for the revelation of the properties of the field within a high - quality microwave cavity  @xcite , the coupling of a bose - einstein condensate to a ( classical ) mechanical oscillator for the investigation on casimir - polder effects  @xcite , and intra - cavity quantum optomechanics , where the radiation - pressure force is used to read the noise properties of a mechanical mode  @xcite . in the latter context ,",
    "in particular , a key parameter is embodied by the temperature at which the mechanical mode operates . indeed",
    ", unwanted thermal effects typically spoil the quantum features enforces in the mechanical system by means of a coherent evolution . having a precise quantitative estimate of the entity of such effects @xcite would be crucial not only for prediction purposes but also to design in the best possible way a quantum - enforcing protocol that accounts , ab initio , such undesired effects . needless to say",
    ", these considerations can be extended straightforwardly to any of the scenarios addressed above .",
