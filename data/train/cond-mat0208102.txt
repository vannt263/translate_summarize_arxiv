    "polyelectrolyte(pe)colloid complexes have recently motivated a great amount of computational and analytical work @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is not only the interesting behavior seen in such systems , but also their potential applications .",
    "for instance , some water - soluble paints are formed by pe ",
    "colloid complexes , in which a colloidal suspension is stabilized by adsorbed charged polymers . a better understanding of these complexes can give hints on how to avoid the precipitation of the particles from the suspension .",
    "another example is the dna - histone complex@xcite , whose behavior is thought to be one of the crucial factors in the packing of dna in living cells@xcite .",
    "most of the previous work on pe - colloid complexes looked essentially at the structure and complexation behavior of the aggregates , e.g. , of one pe and one macroion , @xcite , one pe and many macroions @xcite , one macroion and many pes @xcite , or the effect of overcharging of the macroion @xcite .",
    "while some works discuss the interactions between two macroions in presence of either one or more than two short pe - chains @xcite we concentrate here on the complex formed by one spherical colloid and one pe as a whole and look at its polarizability , as well as the effective interaction @xcite between two isolated complexes . to do this we perform monte carlo ( mc ) computer simulations of one and two neutral symmetric pe - colloid complexes , i.e. , systems where the charge of the pe exactly neutralizes the charge of the colloidal particle .",
    "we focus on the case where the bending energy is small compared to the energy of coulomb coupling , i.e. , the chain is always completely adsorbed on the macroion .    while the results we will show are , strictly speaking , only valid in the limit of low density of complexes and zero salt concentration , we expect these to remain qualitatively correct under more realistic conditions . as we observe in the simulations , the effect of salt at low concentrations ( put into the simulations through a debye - hckel interaction )",
    "affects only slightly the results given for the salt - free system .",
    "also , while both the polarizability and the interaction between complexes is very much influenced by the `` microscopics '' ( i.e. , by the structure of the chain ) , we will show that most of the computer simulation results can be understood using fairly simple principles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ simulation ] we describe the model used and the computer simulation details . in section  [ polarizability ]",
    "we present the simulation results for the dipole moment in an external electrical field of one pe - colloid complex and suggest analytical expressions for the polarizability for all chain lengths . section  [ interaction ] deals with the interaction of two of these complexes for different distances and chain lengths .",
    "we describe how the force is calculated and the results are discussed .",
    "we provide analytical results for the force for short chain lengths and long distances .",

    "naturally , the repulsive interaction between two macroions each with charge valence @xmath34 in distance @xmath2 is given by @xmath35 .",

    "we measured the persistence length of an isolated chain by calculating the bond vector correlations in dependence of the contour distance between the bonds and determining the typical decay length .",
    "we find a linear dependence @xmath49 for a wide range of contour lengths if no intrinsic stiffness is applied .",

    "it is well known that the @xmath53 potential between two charges is not enough to bind them together , i.e. , the coulomb potential between two point charges is not enough to compensate for the loss of entropy through binding ( cf .  manning condensation@xcite ) .",
    "if the particles are put enough close to each other , the system needs a very long time before the unbound stable state is reached . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that two oppositely charged particles are confined to a `` spherical '' box of radius @xmath54 .",

    "in other words , if the two charges are initially put @xmath24 apart , the probability of finding them at @xmath62 apart is much smaller than to find them at @xmath24 . note that @xmath63 increases with @xmath2 : if the particles are initially put very far apart from each other ( say @xmath64 of the order of @xmath34 ) , the system will flow to the stable state much faster , since the ratio @xmath63 become of order unity . in our simulations , and in agreement with previous works , the pe has always stayed at the close vicinity of the colloidal particle , since the parameters are chosen such that eq .",

    "the shape and qualitative behavior of the force remains the same for low salt concentration , only the magnitude of attraction decreases .",
    "as expected , the interaction of short chains is more affected by adding salt since the long - range attraction is due to electrostatic interaction which are now screened . here differences already occur for a salt concentration of @xmath211 and the long - ranged attraction vanishes completely for @xmath212 ( measured for @xmath144 and @xmath77 ) .",

    "the polarizability is strong for small chains and small electrical fields and has a maximum for chain length comparable to the circumference of the colloid .",
    "it can theoretically be described in terms of a thermally fluctuating dipoles with an effective length which depends on the chain length . for chains longer than the circumference of the macroion",

    "this is indeed an effective mechanism of stabilization ( as shown in fig .",
