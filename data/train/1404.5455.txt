    "given that in each case small moves and limited overlap are intended primarily to produce games that are more easily playable by humans , it is natural to ask what would happen in the opposite extreme . in particular , would a rotational block - style puzzle with only a few , highly overlapping , rotations result in a large or a small number of accessible permutations of the blocks ?    an extreme case of this is to consider rotating @xmath16 blocks of square tiles in a @xmath17 rectangle , or an overlapping union of such rectangles .",
