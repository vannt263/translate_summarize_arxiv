    "inverse statistical approaches , modeling pairwise correlations between amino acids in the sequences of homologous proteins across many different organisms , can successfully extract protein structure ( contact ) information . here , we benchmark those statistical approaches on exactly solvable models of proteins , folding on a 3d lattice , to assess the reasons underlying their success and their limitations .",
    "we show that the inferred parameters ( effective pairwise interactions ) of the statistical models have clear and quantitative interpretations in terms of positive ( favoring the native fold ) and negative ( disfavoring competing folds ) protein sequence design .",
    "new sequences randomly drawn from the statistical models are likely to fold into the native structures when effective pairwise interactions are accurately inferred , a performance which can not be achieved with independent - site models .",
    ".3 cm prediction of protein structure from sequence remains a major goal of computational structural biology with significant practical implications .",
    "while great progress was achieved in de novo prediction of structures and even direct folding of smaller globular water soluble proteins @xcite , structure prediction remains challenging for larger proteins , and membrane and other non - globular proteins .",
    "for these cases indirect methods such as homology modeling are most promising .",
    "an approach to predict structure from the statistics of multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) was proposed twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption for these statistical approaches is that residues that covary in a msa are likely to be in close proximity in protein structure @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach has been significantly improved and has become a practical tool to extract structural information from sequence data @xcite , and to help in folding proteins @xcite .",
    "progress was made possible by the application of the maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics @xcite to derive the distribution of sequences in a protein family , _",
    "i.e. _ their probability of appearing in an msa .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to the derivation of gibbs distribution in statistical mechanics , with an effective hamiltonian constructed to reproduce single - site amino - acid frequencies and pairwise amino - acid correlations . as such",
    ", the effective hamiltonian is a potts model @xcite with parameters ( the site - dependent fields and pairwise couplings acting on amino acids ) fitted to reproduce the msa statistics .",
    "this approach allows one to disentangle direct ( corresponding to couplings ) from indirect ( mediated by other sites ) correlations @xcite ; large couplings are much better predictors of contacts than large correlations .",
    "the exploitation of covariation information in proteins extends beyond structural prediction , and is potentially useful for homology detection , for characterizing the fitness changes resulting from mutations , or for designing artificial proteins with ` natural ' properties @xcite .",
    "experiments show in particular that a sizeable fraction of artificial sequences generated to respect the 1- and 2-point amino - acid frequencies calculated from the natural msa of the ww domain ( a short protein domain with @xmath030 amino acids ) acquire the native fold @xcite .",
    "this fraction vanishes when artificial sequences are generated which respect the pattern of single - site frequencies only .",
    "recent studies have shown that inferred maximum - entropy models are helpful to predict the effects of mutations in various protein sequences @xcite , including hiv virus sequences @xcite .    despite those successes fundamental issues remain poorly understood . to what extent",
    "do the inferred couplings reflect the physical ( energetics ) and structural ( contact ) properties of proteins ?",
    "how much are the covariation properties of one family influenced by the need to prevent sequences from folding into competing structures ?",
    "are pairwise correlations , and hence , couplings generally sufficient to capture the statistical features of protein families and define generative models ?    in this work we answer those questions using lattice - based protein ( lp ) models @xcite .",
    "using lp allows us to evaluate the strengths and limitation of the potts inference methods by comparing recovered solutions with known exact ones .",
    "protein - like sequences are generated using a well - defined hamiltonian that employs 20 amino - acid types and the miyazawa - jernigan energy function to approximate contact energies @xcite .",
    "lp share many common properties with real proteins , for instance nontrivial statistical features of the sequences associated with a given fold , with variable conservation along the protein chain @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the covariation properties of lp had not been much studied so far @xcite . here , we do so by generating msa data for various lp folds , and apply to those sequence data the same inverse approaches used for real proteins ( fig",
    ".  1 ) . in particular",
    ", we show that the inferred couplings are excellent predictors of contacts in the protein structure .",
    "in addition , while the inferred potts pairwise couplings mostly reflect the energetics and the contacts in the fold corresponding to the msa , they also strongly depend on the nature of the other folds competing with the native structure , and have transparent interpretations in terms of positive and negative designs .",
    "furthermore , we show that the pairwise potts model is generative : it produces with high probability sequences with the right fold , a performance which can not be achieved by models reproducing single - site frequencies alone .",
    "this is a non - trivial result as the log probability of lp sequences constrained to fold in a given structure is not a sum of pairwise contributions only , but includes multi - body interactions to all orders due to contributions from competing folds .",
    ".3cmwe have generated msa for four representative lp structures shown in fig .",
    "2a , referred to as @xmath1 to @xmath2 ; the energetics of the lp model , the boltzmann probability @xmath3 of a sequence @xmath4 to achieve a fold @xmath5 , and the procedure for sampling the sequence space and generate msa are described in the methods section .",
    "any structure @xmath5 is characterized by the volume it occupies in sequence space ( fig .  1 ) , that is , by the number of sequences @xmath4 it is associated with , _ e.g. _ with values of @xmath3 larger than , say , 0.995 . for the four structures considered here , the numbers of associated sequences are extremely large compared to the msa we have generated ( @xmath6 sequences ) .",
    "the higher this number , the more designable the corresponding structure is expected to be @xcite .",
    "the designability of each structure can be empirically estimated from the diversity of the sequences in the corresponding msa , from the spectral properties of the contact matrix @xcite , and , as shown below in this paper , from the entropy of the potts model inferred from the msa ( methods and table  1 ) .",

    "potts - based contact predictions , either with dca , plm or ace , generally outperform mi - based predictions .",
    "mi , indeed , does not disentangle large indirect correlations mediated by one or more sites from direct correlations due to contacts .",
    "plm and ace couplings are more precise than their dca counterparts and accordingly , give better contact predictions for all four structures ( table  2 ) .",
    "as shown later , most of the missed contacts with ace ( 3 or 4 , depending on the structure in fig .",
    "2a ) are carried by the site at the center of the structure .",
    "why this is so and how to improve contact prediction ( magenta lines in fig .",
    "2a ) will become clear from the detailed interpretation of the potts couplings below .    while the results above were obtained for uniformly sampled msas",
    ", real protein data suffer from imperfect sampling , _",
    "e.g. _ resulting from phylogenetic correlations . to analyze the effects of biases in the sampling on structural predictions in a simple and controlled way we have introduced a sampling procedure that favors sequences with small hamming distances to a reference , wild - type sequence ( methods ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2b , modifying the strength of the bias , @xmath8 , allows us to interpolate smoothly between the uniform sampling above ( @xmath9 ) and strongly biased msas with reduced sequence diversities ( large @xmath8 values ) .",
    "results for contact prediction obtained with the plm procedure are reported in fig .",
    "we observe that performances worsen as the bias in the msas increases .",
    "empirical reweighting of the sequence statistics according to their similarity with the other sequences in the msa ( methods ) , as usually done for real protein data , efficiently improves the quality of the structural prediction for intermediate bias values . for very strong biases ( @xmath10 in fig .",
    "2b ) , the effective number of sequences resulting from reweighting is so low that results become very poor .",
    "* potts model generates good folding sequences with high probability , in contrast to independent - site model *    .3 cm we now test the ability of the inferred potts model to be generative , that is , to produce sequences having high probability of folding into the native structure . to do so",

    "[ [ potts ] ] , from the msa , hereafter referred to as ` natural ' , of structure @xmath11 with the ace procedure .",
    "we sample the potts distribution using monte carlo simulations , thereby generating a new msa , hereafter referred to as ` potts - ace ' .",

    "conversely , sequences generated with an independent - site model ( i m , see methods ) following the same procedure are unlikely to have the right fold , as shown in fig",
    "pairwise interactions are therefore crucial to design new sequences with the right fold .",
    "because the potts - ace model is generative , its entropy can be used as a quantitative estimate of the designability of the structure , with results reported in table  1 and s1 text , section i.b .    to better characterize the generative properties of potts - ace , we show in fig .",

    "we observe a roughly monotonic relationship between the two quantities : the lower the energy with the potts - ace model , the more likely is the sequence to be a good folder ( fig .",
    "however , while the potts - ace model rightly predicts that sequences with increasing energies are less likely to be good folders , the value of @xmath14 is less and less predictive about the precise value of @xmath15 , as shown by the increasing dispersion in fig .  3b .",
    "note that the low - energy part of this scatter plot , corresponding to the best sequences generated with the potts - ace model , is quantitatively similar to its counterpart for the ` natural ' msa , see fig .",

    "the potts - plm model reproduces the diversity of natural msa , but generates sequences , whose folding properties largely vary from very good to very poor ( fig .",

    "the closest competitor is defined as the structure that is closest in energy ( smallest gap ) to the native structure , see methods , eq .  [ 9 ] .",
    "informally speaking , @xmath35 is the ` most ' dangerous structure as sequences folding in @xmath11 could fold in @xmath35 upon a few undesirable mutations . as the native fold is not in competition with a single structure ,",
    "the notion of closest competitor is somewhat reductive , but is helpful to understand the mechanisms controlling covariation and the meaning of the inferred couplings .",
    "in particular , comparison of the contact maps of @xmath11 and @xmath35 allows us to define four classes of contacts , and to illustrate concretely the mechanisms for positive and negative designs @xcite .",
    "pairs with large and positive @xmath32 are in contact in the native fold , but not in the competitor structures .",

    "the corresponding couplings are weak , and contact prediction is difficult .",
    "pairs of sites in contact in both @xmath11 and its closest competitor , @xmath35 , form the shared native ( sn ) class in fig .  4c .",

    "2a and its contact map in fig .",
    "4b ) as these central contacts are typically shared with closest competitor folds ( fig .  4d and fig .",

    "sites @xmath18 not in contact in the native fold correspond to negative @xmath32 .",
    "most of those pairs are not in contact in the competitor structures either and correspond to weak pressures and weak inferred couplings .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated by the non - native ( nn ) class , which gathers the pairs of sites that are neither in contact in @xmath11 more in @xmath35 , see fig .",

    "4b for structure @xmath11 and its competitors ) , and which correspond to weak , positive pressures .",
    "we find , for the four structures studied , that 27 out of the 28 largest projections do correspond to real contacts ( table  2 ) .    the evolutionary pressures , averaged over the pairs of sites in the un , sn and cc classes , give @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",

    ".5 cm lattice proteins offer a fully controlled , nontrivial benchmark to characterize the factors that affect the success of inverse statistical approaches in predicting structure from multi sequence alignments ( msa ) . the maximum entropy potts model , inferred to reproduce the low - order statistics of an msa , can be successfully used for structure prediction .",
    "potts - based predictions , in particular with accurate sophisticated inference methods ( plm , ace ) , outperform mutual information approaches on lattice protein data ( fig .",

    "an important finding in the present work is the approximate linear relationship between the inferred potts couplings , @xmath16 , and the miyazawa - jernigan energetic parameters , @xmath36 , across the pairs of amino acids @xmath43 for a given pair of sites @xmath18 , eq .",
    "[ [ slopedef ] ] and fig .",
    "the slope of this linear relationship , @xmath20 , is a measure of the covariation ` pressure ' on the pair @xmath18 due to the structural constraints .",

    "[ apc ] ] , are directly related to the local properties of the contact map on sites @xmath18 ( and not on other sites ) , which explains the success of inverse approaches to disentangle direct from indirect effects in amino - acid correlations .",
    "however , the relationship also involves the average contact map @xmath45 , originating from the competitor folds . as @xmath45 ,",
    "contrary to the native contact map @xmath46 , is not sparse , neither are the couplings @xmath47 .",
    "couplings can , in particular , take non - zero values for @xmath18 in contact in the competing folds ( @xmath26 close to 1 ) , but not in the native fold ( @xmath48 ) , see figs .",
    "those ` repulsive ' couplings give rise to negative pressures @xmath20 , and prevent the sequence from forming contacts that would result in the wrong fold , a clear illustration of negative design @xcite .",
    "reciprocally , sites in contact in the native fold ( @xmath49 ) need not be subject to strong covariation and associated to strong couplings , if they are also in contact in the competing folds ( @xmath26 close to 1 ) .",
    "our results clearly show that strong couplings do not necessarily imply , nor require structural contact ( in the native fold ) .",
    "they also explain the success and limitations of contact prediction based on the magnitude of the inferred couplings ( fig .",
    "2a ) .    a second major result of our approach , shown in figs .",
    "3a&b , is that the inferred potts model , when accurately inferred , here , with the ace procedure , generates sequences that fold with high probability in the native state and show amino - acid diversity similar to the one observed in the original msa .",
    "this performance is remarkable .",
    "while the energy of a lp sequence in a given structure is a sum of pairwise contributions only , the effective hamiltonian of the sequences constrained to fold with high probability in this structure ( and not in the competing folds ) includes high - order multi - body interactions ( originating from the competing folds ) between amino acids , as can be expected for real proteins .",
    "furthermore , independent - site models are unable to produce sequences with the correct fold ( fig .",

    "the generative character of the potts model , combined with the linear relationship between couplings and energetics parameters , agrees with previous studies showing that designed and real protein - like sequences are generated by gibbs measure with hamiltonian reflecting real protein energetics @xcite .",
    "we stress that couplings have to be inferred with great care , going beyond the mean - field dca approximation , in order for the potts model to be generative ( fig .",
    "the analysis of real protein data could benefit from our analysis in several ways .",
    "first , the understanding of the relationship between the couplings and the contact map obtained here indicates that the pressures @xmath20 ( eq .  [ [ scoring_projmj ] ] ) are excellent estimators of contacts ( fig .",
    "2a ) , and may outperform the usual scores , @xmath50 ( eq .  [ [ apc ] ] ) .",
    "the use of @xmath20 allows one to both keep track of the sign of the couplings ( and avoid false positives corresponding to pressures originating from negative design , see above ) and increase signal - to - noise ratio , by removing noise in the inferred couplings not aligned along the miyazawa - jernigan energy matrix . in real proteins ,",
    "the physico - chemical properties of amino acids suggest the existence of different classes of contacts , whose energetics could be inferred from large - scale analysis of databases and used to define class templates @xmath51 .",
    "projections of the inferred potts couplings on those templates could in turn be used for contact predictions . secondly , the detailed analysis of lattice proteins done here has allowed us to better understand how the existence of positive and negative design influences the covariation statistics of the msa , and , hence , the properties of the inferred couplings .",
    "the relevance of negative design was already put forward in literature , _",
    "e.g. _ in the study of the tim - barrel fold protein @xcite",
    ". a promising path to further investigate negative design could be the study of coexistence between natively folded and misfolded proteins @xcite .",
    "the direct estimate of @xmath52 in that case would be straightforward , as it would essentially correspond to the contact map of the misfolded competing structure . more generally @xmath53 in real proteins",

    "this is the subject of future work .",
    "last of all , our work suggests a practical way to quantify the designability of a protein family , _",
    "i.e. _ to measure the number of sequences ` belonging ' to the family .",
