    "more refined characterizations , giving the penrose diagrams of the main theorems , can be then obtained by exploiting different manifestations of monotonicity in each of the separate cases .",

    "given the condition @xmath101 , the statement @xmath155 and the information about @xmath129 follow as a special case of the result of the previous section .",
    "the aspect special to the asymptotically flat case is that we can now give a sufficient condition for @xmath101 to hold , namely @xmath128 , and this can be related to initial data in view of the monotonicity properties of @xmath78 .",

    "the ( locally defined ) killing vector fields can be extended @xmath35 in a neighbourhood of any @xmath163 , and their integral curves through points of @xmath117 must stay on @xmath117 . in lemma  [ nprevlem ] , it is proven that we can write @xmath117 as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 are points @xmath159 where the span of the killing fields is @xmath16-dimensional in a neighborhood of @xmath159 on @xmath117 , and @xmath166 is the set where this span is @xmath15-dimensional .",
    "moreover , it is proven that @xmath167 is a @xmath168 null hypersurface whose null generator lies in the span of the killing vectors .",
    "a particularly simple way in which the above could happen is if @xmath117 is what is known as a _ killing horizon _ ,",
    "i.e.  when there is a single killing field @xmath169 everywhere tangent to the null generator of @xmath117 .",
    "( this is the case for gowdy symmetry , by the results of  @xcite .",
    "it is also the case locally around a @xmath170 . )",
    "if this is the case , then , it has been shown in  @xcite that @xmath171    in the case of @xmath166 , however , the situation is in general considerably more complicated . as the example of the standard future light cone in minkowski space ( thought of as the past cauchy horizon of its hyperbolically symmetric future ) reveals , the killing field generating the null direction of the horizon can vary from point to point .",
    "thus the cauchy horizon is no longer necessarily a killing horizon .",
    "nonetheless , we still recover the identity @xmath172 on @xmath166 , at least in the nondegenerate case .",
    "essentially , for this we compute both sides of the well - known identity @xmath173 for killing fields by using a well - chosen frame .",
    "the properties of this frame are derived in section  [ framesec ] . for this",
    ", heavy use is made of the lie algebra of hyperbolic symmetry , and the twist - free condition for the killing fields .",
    "various cases must be considered separately .    in the highly degenerate case of vanishing surface gravity",
    ", we can deduce from a local calculation the inequality @xmath174 on @xmath166 .",
    "thus @xmath172 holds on all of @xmath175 as long as the spacetime satisfies the null convergence condition .",
    "in particular , @xmath172 holds on all of @xmath167 when theorem  [ rigid ] is specialised to our vlasov case .",
    "finally , for the @xmath36 case , @xmath172 follows from the rigidity theorem proven in our  @xcite for general @xmath176-symmetric spacetimes .",
    "these inferences for our vlasov case are stated explicitly as proposition  [ riccivanish ] .",

    "for , given a suitable genericity assumption on initial data , we show in proposition  [ positricci ] that @xmath177 for a dense open subset of @xmath117 .",
    "this contradicts @xmath172 , showing thus generic inextendibility .",
    "the proof of proposition  [ positricci ] reveals the nature of the necessary genericity assumption : assuming @xmath178 , we construct a transverse timelike geodesic crossing the cauchy horizon into the original spacetime , with arbitrary small angular momentum . by global hyperbolicity , this must intersect the cauchy surface somewhere . by a continuity argument ,",
    "if the lift of this geodesic to the tangent bundle intersects the support of @xmath37 , then one can show @xmath179 .",
    "thus , a sufficient genericity assumption would be that the vlasov field is supported for all points in phase space with angular momentum less than a fixed constant . by varying slightly , one weakens this to the condition that the vlasov field not vanish identically in any open set intersecting the set where angular momentum is less than a fixed constant .",
    "note that this class of initial data is more general than that studied in previous analysis of the einstein - vlasov system ; it is easily handled here , however , in view of the nature of our estimates .",
    "see also the comments in section  [ mgd ] .",
    "the final case which must be understood is when the penrose diagram is as in the last diagram of theorem  [ introthe ] , and @xmath180 .",
    "suppose @xmath10 were extendible at every point corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath51 would correspond to a _ compact _",
    "cauchy horizon foliated by closed null curves .",
    "the results of  @xcite would apply to yield an additional killing field in the direction of the null generator .",
    "one could then apply @xmath172 and argue as in the previous section , or , better , argue that the flux of matter through the cauchy horizon must vanish , and then , by conservation of particle current ( see below ) , that the initial matter must vanish , i.e.  @xmath181 identically in the spacetime .    without assuming regularity everywhere for @xmath97 or @xmath182 , one can not argue as above . nonetheless , we are still able to carry out global arguments , at least in all cases except the case where @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath183 .",
    "we first note that we have previously reduced the problem to null radial geodesic extendibility .",
    "supposing that there exists a null radial geodesic crossing to an extension , without loss of generality let this be @xmath184 , we first show that we can bound the particle flux along this geodesic .",
    "this bound is enunciated in @xmath185 .",
    "it follows because we can bound @xmath186 pointwise in suitable coordinates from the null components of energy momentum , which themselves are bounded as they can be related to curvature in a parallely propagated frame along a geodesic passing to the extension . by conservation of matter ,",
    "from @xmath185 we obtain uniform bounds on the flux of matter through the boundaries @xmath184 and @xmath187 of a region @xmath104 defined as the union of @xmath12 copies of a fundamental domain .",
    "refer to the diagram in section  [ thelastcases ] . for",
    ", using the discrete transformation of the universal cover @xmath23 of @xmath80 ( corresponding to the @xmath188 factor ) , it follows that these fluxes must coincide .",
    "thus , considering a sequence of constant @xmath72 curves in @xmath104 approaching @xmath182 , the flux through these curves must approach the initial flux .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to showing that the flux through these curves approaches zero .    first , via raychaudhuri , our bounds for the flux , and spacetime integral estimates in the style of section  [ localest ] ( compare @xmath145 and @xmath189 ) , we are able to derive upper and lower bounds for @xmath79 with respect to the null coordinate system employed . here , essential use is made of @xmath190 ( or the bound on the total volume of spacetime in the case @xmath5 , @xmath2 ) and it is for this monotonicity to be in the right direction that we must exclude the exceptional case .",
    "applying again raychaudhuri , this allows us to deduce @xmath191 .",
    "this states that an `` energy '' flux corresponding to the vlasov matter approaches zero .",
    "the above relation can be thought of as the source of globally - induced rigidity from the monotonicity on the einstein side .    in view of the bounds obtained , it is only a small step ( via inequality @xmath192 ) to pass from the statement of the energy flux to that of the particle flux .",
    "we may then again deduce by a limiting argument and conservation of particle number , that the matter must vanish identically .    though not essential for showing cosmic censorship",
    ", we can exclude @xmath193 if @xmath37 does not vanish identically in various cases , including the case @xmath194 , @xmath2 , for arbitrary data , and @xmath194 , @xmath162 for antitrapped data , where the latter result concerns , however , only the past .",
    "see propositions  [ stoparel9ov ] and  [ stomellov ] and their corollaries .",
    "the results of this section demonstrate the power of the essentially geometrically invariant approach of this paper , and of spacetime integral estimates : were the analysis `` married '' to , say , area radial coordinates , then it would be very difficult to obtain appropriate estimates near @xmath97 , where these coordinates break down .      as discussed in section  [ hard ] , to infer generic inextendibility",
    ", one must work in a class of initial data more general than @xmath37 of compact support in momentum space , considered in previous work .",
    "the nature of the fundamental estimates ( section  [ localest ] ) make it irrelevant whether one works in the class of data of compact support or whether @xmath37 is allowed to decay suitably fast in momentum . in view of the comments in the next section",
    ", it would be useful to extend this analysis to other symmetry classes .",
    "the locally - induced rigidity argument for cauchy horizons can be adapted to general @xmath176-symmetric spacetimes .",
    "( the @xmath36 surface symmetric case is a subset of these . ) in view of previous work  @xcite , it follows that strong cosmic censorship holds for this model , as the arguments of  @xcite can be easily adapted to the class of data discussed in section  [ mgd ] .",
    "these issues are discussed in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "a special case of @xmath176 is gowdy symmetry , where h.  ringstrm  @xcite has proven strong cosmic censorship in the vacuum case by a deep study of the generic asymptotic profile of the solution in the approach to @xmath158 .",
    "generalisation of this method to general @xmath176 spacetimes would appear quite difficult , as the expected asymptotic profiles are much more complicated .",

    "this holds if the matter model satisfies the dominant energy condition .",

    "thus , either way , it appears that one should expect the boundary of spacetime to contain null portions .",

    "<S> @xmath4 , @xmath5 , we give a detailed geometric characterization of possible `` boundary '' components of spacetime ; the remaining obstruction to showing strong cosmic censorship in this case has to do with the possible formation of extremal schwarzschild - de sitter - type black holes . in the special case that the initial symmetric surfaces are all expanding , </S>",
    "<S> strong cosmic censorship is shown in the past for all @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results also lead to a geometric characterization of the future boundary of black hole interiors for the collapse of asymptotically flat data : in particular , in the case of small perturbations of schwarzschild data , it is shown that these solutions do _ not _ exhibit cauchy horizons emanating from @xmath7 with strictly positive limiting area radius . </S>"
