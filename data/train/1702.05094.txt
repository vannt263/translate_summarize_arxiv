    "as the most massive collapsed structures in the universe , galaxy clusters provide unique laboratories for studying physics on very large and energetic scales . in particular , x - ray observations of galaxy clusters , which probe the hot ( @xmath1010@xmath11k ) intracluster medium ( icm ) , lead to an understanding of cluster - cluster mergers , the most energetic phenomena in the universe ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allow detailed studies of the effects of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on large scales ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "the cores of galaxy clusters represent one of the least understood regimes outside of our galaxy ( see review by * ? ? ?",

    "* )  a phenomenon that simulations are only recently beginning to reproduce ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the detailed physics of the icm in nearby clusters has been studied in depth , the _ evolution _ of the icm has only recently become an active area of research .",
    "this change is due , in large part , to the success of sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys , which select galaxy clusters via their imprint on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  an effect that is , in principle , independent of redshift . since the first discovery of a galaxy cluster via the sz effect @xcite",

    "with the rapid growth of nir- and sz - selected cluster catalogs has come the ability to study galaxy cluster evolution over an unprecedented range in redshift .",
    "however , the majority of the x - ray follow - up of the most distant clusters has focused on single extreme objects , such as xmmxcs j2215.9 - 1738 at @xmath12 @xcite , xdcp j0044.0 - 2033 at @xmath13 @xcite , idcs1426.5 + 3508 at @xmath14 @xcite , and 3c294 at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this relative lack of statistically - complete x - ray studies of distant clusters , with few exceptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , is broadly due to the small number of known high-@xmath16 clusters and the increased exposure times necessary at such high redshifts . without such samples , our ability to make general conclusions about cluster evolution is severely limited .    in recent years , we have completed a survey of 90 sz - selected clusters with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , spanning @xmath3 and with m@xmath17 m@xmath18 .",

    "these studies benefit from the unique combination of the spt selection function , which is roughly independent of both redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the dynamical state of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the surface brightness profile for each cluster is extracted in the energy range 0.72.0 kev , in 20 annuli defined as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and r@xmath25 is initially estimated based on the m  t@xmath72 relation ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the cluster center is within 1@xmath95 of the on - axis position , meaning that the innermost bin is roughly the size of ( or larger than ) the psf . following @xcite , we correct surface brightness profiles for spatial variations in temperature , metallicity , and telescope effective area , assuming a universal temperature profile from @xcite , normalized to the measured @xmath96 , and a constant metallicity profile .",
    "calibrated ( including k - corrected ) surface brightness profiles are expressed as an emission measure integral , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the electron and proton densities , respectively . to deproject this into a three - dimensional electron density , we model the calibrated surface brightness profile with a modified beta model : @xmath100 which is projected along the line of sight through the full cluster volume , to match the aforementioned emission measure integral . here , @xmath101 is the density normalization , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are scaling radii of the core and extended components , respectively .",
    "we estimate the three - dimensional gas density assuming @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the average nuclear charge and mass , respectively , for a plasma with 0.3z@xmath18 metallicity .",
    "this assumption of constant , unevolving metallicity is well - motivated by recent work @xcite .",
    "gas masses are derived by integrating @xmath108 over the cluster volume .",
    "we refine our estimate of m@xmath25 and @xmath109 for each cluster by iteratively satisfying the m@xmath110m@xmath25 relation from @xcite .      following @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we quantify the x - ray morphology using the `` photon asymmetry '' ( @xmath111 ) statistic .",
    "this statistic quantifies the amount of asymmetry by comparing the cumulative distribution of x - ray counts as a function of azimuth for a given radial annulus to a uniform distribution , computing a probability that these two distributions are different .",
    "combining these probabilities for multiple radial bins provides an overall probability that the cluster has azimuthally uniform brightness .",
    "this statistic , which is sensitive to azimuthal asymmetry , is complementary to statistics which measure the surface brightness concentration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , this statistic was shown to be unbiased to the quality of the data used , both in terms of angular resolution and signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "this makes it optimal for comparing the morphology of clusters at low and high redshift , where both angular resolution and data quality can vary dramatically .    for each cluster we measure @xmath111 , with reference to both the peak and centroid centers ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "we report these measurements in table [ table : data ] for the spt - hi@xmath16 clusters  those for the spt - xvp clusters are reported in @xcite .",
    "we do not directly compare morphological measurements of high-@xmath16 clusters to low-@xmath16 , x - ray - selected clusters due to a lack of existing @xmath111 measurements for the latter .",
    "in @xcite , we demonstrated , qualitatively , that the gas density ( @xmath112 ) profiles of massive clusters evolve self similarly outside of @xmath40.15r@xmath25 , over the redshift range @xmath113 . in the cores of clusters , this earlier work showed that the `` peakiness '' decreased significantly with increasing redshift , leading to less cuspy density profiles at early times . in figure",
    "[ fig : rhog ] we extend this earlier analysis to include the 8 spt - hi@xmath16 clusters presented in this work . in the upper left panel of figure [ fig : rhog ] , we show the gas density profiles for each of the spt - hi@xmath16 clusters , normalized to the critical density of the universe ( @xmath114 ) and in terms of the scaled radius , @xmath115 .",
    "these profiles show an order of magnitude scatter in the innermost bin ( @xmath116 ) and collapse onto a single profile by @xmath117 . at large radii , the increased scatter is due to increased noise in the measurements , rather than real , physical scatter as observed in the cores .",
    "next to these individual clusters , we show the average profile in 5 different redshift bins , spanning @xmath118 . as in @xcite",
    ", we see a flattening of the profile with redshift , which appears to extend to @xmath0 .",
    "given that the average profile can be biased towards cool cores ( which have very high central density ) , we also show the median profile in the right - most panel .",
    "the median profile is computed by taking the median density at each radius for all clusters within a given redshift range .",
    "this panel demonstrates that the _ median _ cluster at @xmath19 has no visible cusp in the inner density profile ( @xmath119 for @xmath120 ) .",
    "these data show that , while some clusters at @xmath121 do have central density cusps ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we then fit a function of the form @xmath127 within each radial bin , determining the redshift dependence of the density profile at that radius .",

    "this is consistent with simulations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with data from other surveys ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with the general intuition that gravity is the dominant physics at these radii .",
    "the large uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath128 at @xmath132 is a result of the background emission dominating by a substantial margin at these radii , leading to relatively large systematic uncertainties in the gas density measurement . at small radii ( @xmath133 ) , the measured value of @xmath128 decreases , from @xmath131 at @xmath134 to @xmath135 at @xmath116 .",

    "we find no measurable evolution in the mean , maximum , or minimum central densities over the full redshift range explored here , independent of the choice of centering method .",
    "we note that the centering choice for the clusters from @xcite is slightly different than ours , such that it matches the `` peak '' selection for relaxed clusters , and the `` centroid '' selection for disturbed clusters . as such",

    "assuming average core temperatures of @xmath45 kev , these maxima and minima correspond to central cooling times of 0.5gyr and 11.2gyr , respectively .",

    "this suggests that the core evolution shown in figure [ fig : rhog ] , and reported in @xcite , is not a byproduct of the mass evolution of clusters , but is indeed a steady change in the median density slope over the past @xmath410 gyr for clusters at a fixed mass .",
    "figures [ fig : rhog ] , [ fig : selfsim ] , [ fig : nepeak ] , and [ fig : cc_profiles ] reveal several important features about the icm density profiles in massive clusters .",

    "this two - stage evolution is demonstrated in figure [ fig : cc_growth ] .",
    "this figure shows that the evolution in cuspiness that we see in figure [ fig : rhog ] , and that was previously reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , can be reproduced with a non - evolving core embedded in a self similarly-evolving cluster .",
    "the evolving cuspiness , in this scenario , is due to the increasing contrast between the dense cool core and the rest of the cluster which , at high-@xmath16 , is at higher density for a given r / r@xmath25 .",

    "the mass of the cool core was defined as the difference between the cool core and average non - cool core profile ( as defined here ) , but only integrated to 0.1r@xmath25 . because r@xmath25 is a physically smaller radius for high-@xmath16 clusters , this meant that we were integrating over much less of the core volume for high-@xmath16 clusters than for their low-@xmath16 counterparts .",
    "since the cool core does not appear to be evolving in size , it makes more sense to define the outer radius in physical units ( i.e. , 100kpc ) rather than relative units ( i.e. , 0.1r@xmath25 ) .    in summary , we find that the evolution in the icm density profiles for massive clusters from @xmath148 to @xmath121 is well - described by the sum of a self similarly - evolving non - cool core profile and a non - evolving cool core .",
