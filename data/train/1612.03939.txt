    "more than 50 exoplanets have been discovered by the gravitational microlensing method @xcite , since the first discovery more than a decade ago @xcite . this is a small fraction of the number of planets found by the transit @xcite and radial velocity ( rv ; butler et al .",
    "2006 ) methods , but the microlensing method can detect a class of planets that are invisible to other methods .",
    "microlensing is uniquely sensitive to planets down to an earth - mass @xcite beyond the snow line , where the other detection methods are ineffective @xcite . according to the core accretion theory @xcite ,",
    "the snow line is the radius in the protoplanetary disk beyond which the temperature is cold enough for ices to condense .",
    "the presence of ices increases the density of solids in the protoplanetary disk by a factor of 34 @xcite , and this is thought to allow the ice - rock cores of giant planets to form more quickly than solid planets can condense in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the core accretion theory predicts @xcite that gas giant planet cores can grow to @xmath16 earth - masses of solid material beyond the snow line , and this is enough to trigger the rapid accretion of hydrogen and helium gas needed to form a gas giant .",
    "however , there is a danger that the hydrogen and helium might dissipate before the core grows larger enough to trigger rapid accretion . in this case , we are likely to be left with a failed gas - giant - core planet .",
    "it is thought that these failed gas - giant core planets may be especially common around low - mass host stars @xcite .",
    "the early results from microlensing support this idea .",
    "microlensing has found numerous examples of planets that are consistent with the expectations for these failed gas - giant - core planets @xcite .",
    "other methods have not been able to detect such planets , so the microlensing method is uniquely sensitive to this population of failed gas - giant - core planets .",
    "the microlensing method is also uniquely sensitive to old , free - floating planets that may have been ejected from the planetary system of their formation .",
    "while it is possible to detect young , unbound planetary mass objects directly in the infrared @xcite , the infrared surveys do not yet have the sensitivity to detect planets of @xmath17 jupiter - mass , where the signal of a large free - floating , or rogue , planet population has been found by microlensing @xcite .",
    "some have suggested that this population of apparently rogue planets might be bound in orbits so wide that microlensing can not detect the host stars @xcite , but the microlensing results indicate that the median projected distance from rogue planets to potential host stars is likely to be @xmath18au @xcite .",
    "there have been several previous statistical studies of exoplanets found by microlensing .",
    "statistical studies @xcite from early microlensing survey data with no planet detections were able to put upper limits on only the cold gas giant planet frequency . using 10 microlensing planet detections , @xcite looked at the distribution of planets as a function of their mass ratio , @xmath0 , and found that the exoplanet distribution beyond the snow line could be explained by a power law mass ratio function of the form , @xmath19 , but this calculation was done without a calculation of the absolute exoplanet detection efficiency .",
    "( throughout this paper , we use @xmath20 to refer to the base-10 logarithm . )",
    "they used the detection efficiency for each planetary event , but did not calculate the efficiency for events without planetary signals .",
    "this allowed the determination of the relative efficiency for different types of planets , but it was insufficient to determine the absolute detection efficiency .",
    "so , @xcite could only calculate the power - law index of the mass ratio function , but not its normalization .",
    "@xcite took advantage of the very high detection efficiency provided by high magnification microlensing events @xcite to do the first calculation of the absolute detection efficiency with a sample of 13 high magnification microlensing events including 6 planets .",
    "while the very high planet detection efficiency is provided by high magnification events , there is a well - known degeneracy between close and wide planet solutions @xcite that implies that , for most high magnification events , there is a significant ambiguity in the star - planet separation unless it is close to the einstein radius . as a result , it is difficult to measure the separation dependence of the planet population with a sample of high magnification events , and @xcite did not attempt to do so .",
    "they found a planet frequency of @xmath21 at @xmath22 beyond the snow line .",
    "the planet collaboration @xcite also published a statistical analysis of planetary events found in their 20022007 data .",
    "they had a much larger sample of microlensing events , but the number of planets discovered was smaller , 3 , compared to 6 planets found in the @xcite sample .",
    "because one planet is common to both samples , the combined sample includes 8 planets , and @xcite use this combined sample and the slope of the power law mass ratio function from @xcite to find the cold planet mass function @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "this result is quoted in terms of planetary mass instead of mass ratio because @xcite used a bayesian method @xcite to convert from the mass ratios , @xmath0 , measured in the microlensing light curves to masses .",
    "this method implicitly assumes that the probability for a star to host a planet of a given mass ratio is independent of the stellar mass and location of the system through the galaxy .",
    "this assumption is probably safe with such a small sample , but it could be problematic with samples large enough to measure the dependence of the exoplanet mass function on the mass of and distance to the host star .",
    "a more recent paper is based on three - site survey data using combined data from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) , moa , and wise wide - field microlensing surveys @xcite .",
    "this has some overlap with our own sample , as it includes data from 2011 to 2014 , but it only includes events from the @xmath25 covered by all three surveys .",
    "they used a coarse grid in mass ratio and separation for the light curve modeling of some of the binary and planetary events found in their sample .",
    "this appears to have resulted in important errors in the parameters for some events , as we discuss in section  [ subsec : com_micro ] .",
    "nevertheless , they estimate a slope of @xmath26 .",
    "they also estimated the total exoplanet frequency for @xmath27 .",
    "recent studies @xcite have compared the exoplanet distribution found by microlensing with the results of rv observations of m - dwarfs and found that the results from both methods are consistent , although the radial velocity is only sensitive to planets of jupiter - mass or greater beyond the snow line .",
    "the _ kepler _ telescope @xcite has revealed the planet population in close orbits , mostly within 1 au around solar type stars .",
    "most of detected planets or candidates are located within the orbit of mercury and many multiple planets systems consisting of super earths have been found @xcite .",
    "microlensing also has detected a number of super earths @xcite , but the planets found by microlensing are in much longer period orbits around somewhat lower - mass stars than the small planets found by _ kepler_. also , the masses for small _ kepler _ planets with longer orbital periods are rarely determined , and when they are determined , they show surprisingly low densities @xcite .",
    "attempts to measure a mass - radius relation find a scatter much larger than the measurement errors @xcite , indicating a range of compositions for exoplanets at a fixed mass or radius . the average exoplanet composition could change dramatically between the well measured _ kepler _ planets at @xmath28au and microlens planets beyond the snow line .",
    "thus , it is difficult to compare statistical analyses of exoplanet frequency from _ kepler _ data with those from current , ground - based microlensing survey data .",
    "future space - based exoplanet microlensing surveys @xcite , such as the _ wfirst _ survey @xcite , will explore a much wider range of orbital periods and will therefore have overlap with _",
    "the one observable that relates to interesting lens properties in single mass microlensing light curves is the event time scale , the time required for a source star to cross the angular einstein radius , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relative lens - source proper motion , @xmath31 is mass of the lens system , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the distance to the lens and source star , respectively . in planetary microlensing events , where signals of both the planet and its host star are seen , we can also measure planet - star mass ratio and angular separation relative to the angular einstein radius . in most planetary events ,",
    "the sharp planetary light curve features resolve the finite angular size of the source star , allowing the source radius crossing time , @xmath34 , to be measured .",
    "since the angular radius of the source star , @xmath35 , can be determined from its brightness and color @xcite , the measurement of @xmath35 also provides a measurement of the angular einstein radius , @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not enough to determine the mass or distance of the lens system .",
    "instead , we are left with the following mass - distance relation , @xmath37 where @xmath38 . in some cases ,",
    "the actual mass can be determined if a microlensing parallax signal @xcite is measured @xcite or when the host star is detected with high angular resolution adaptive optics @xcite or hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite observations , but in most cases , the mass and distance to the lens are not directly determined . often , microlens planet discovery papers estimate the mass and distance with a bayesian analysis , under the assumption that exoplanet properties do not depend on the host mass and distance",
    ". we would eventually like to measure this dependence on the host mass and distance , so we can not use such mass estimates that assume the answer to a question that we are trying to investigate .    in this paper",
    ", we report on our analysis of the exoplanet mass ratio function as a function of separation ( in the angular einstein radius units ) using microlensing events detected by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaboration alert system during the years 2007 - 2012 .",
    "we use planet to host star mass ratio instead of planet mass , because the former is measurable without any assumption regarding the estimate of host star masses .",
    "this is the first statistical analysis of the prevalence and properties of exoplanets based on microlensing survey data , which includes full light curve analysis of binary and planetary events to precisely determine the mass ratio and separation for events with significant planetary or binary signals .",
    "previous analyses based on microlensing survey data either identified no definitive planetary events @xcite , or included an incomplete light curve analysis that did not definitively identify planetary events @xcite .",
    "previous complete statistical analyses @xcite have been based on planets detected in the data from microlensing follow - up groups who focus on events thought to have relatively high sensitivity to exoplanets .",
    "in contrast , microlensing survey groups use large field - of - view telescopes to observe a much larger number of events .",
    "many of these events have low planet detection efficiency , but overall , the sensitivity of the surveys is higher because of the much larger number of events observed @xcite .",
    "this is why the new microlensing projects just coming online now @xcite and planned for the future @xcite are all high cadence surveys that will find exoplanet signals in high cadence , wide - field , survey data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the moa survey observations , as well as observations by other telescopes that are used to help classify and characterize anomalous microlensing events in section [ sec_obs ] . in section [ sec_eve_sel ] , we explain how microlensing events from the full 2007 - 2012 sample are selected for use to search for planetary signals and determine our planet detection efficiency . we describe our detection efficiency to planets in section [ sec_est_de ] .",
    "the exoplanet mass ratio function is presented in section [ sec_pla_fre ] , and our results are discussed in section [ sec_dis ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec_sum ] .",
    "the microlensing method requires the monitoring of tens of millions of stars to find gravitational microlensing events .",
    "it also requires high cadence photometric monitoring to detect planetary signals , which have short time scales , ranging from a few hours to a few days for earth and jupiter - mass planets , respectively . to find such rare , unpredictable planetary signals , the survey and follow - up teams have collaborated to comprise a large observational network .",
    "since 2006 , the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaboration has surveyed the galactic bulge using the dedicated 1.8 m moa - ii telescope at mt.john university observatory in new zealand . this telescope employs the moa - cam3 @xcite ccd camera consisting of ten @xmath39 detectors with a plate scale of 0.58 arcsec @xmath40 .",
    "it is mounted at the prime focus and has a @xmath41 field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "this wide fov allows us to monitor @xmath42 of the galactic bulge with cadences ranging from 15 minutes for the fields with the highest microlensing rate , to 45 minutes for fields with a medium microlensing rate , to 95 minutes for the fields with the lowest microlensing rate .",
    "these high cadence observations allow the moa survey to detect planetary signals in all the observed microlensing events , rather than just the fraction of events that are monitored for a fraction of their duration in the survey plus follow - up strategy suggested by @xcite and employed in the previous statistical analysis of @xcite and @xcite . the larger number of events that can be surveyed for planets leads to a higher planet detection rate .",
    "we find nearly 4 planetary events per year compared to an average of about 1 planetary event per year from the alert and follow - up strategy .",
    "once moa identifies a candidate microlensing event in progress , we issue a microlensing event alert@xcite , often within 1 hour of the observation that triggered the alert .",
    "it is these events , found by the moa alert system that we use for our sample of microlensing events .",
    "our sample includes events announced by the moa alert system in 2007  2012 , and they consist of 488 , 477 , 563 , 607 , 485 , and 680 events , respectively in the years 2007  2012 .",
    "the moa alert system was only partially functional in 2006 , so the 2006 data are not included in this analysis .",
    "the other major survey group that operated during the 2007  2012 seasons is the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) collaboration @xcite which uses the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the years 2007 , 2008 , and very early 2009 were the final years of the ogle - iii survey using a ccd camera with a field - of - view of @xmath43 , which was too small a field - of - view for a high cadence survey , but in 2010 , ogle upgraded its ccd camera to the @xmath44 ogle - iv camera and began the high cadence ogle - iv survey .",
    "a third high cadence survey was started in 2011 at the wise observatory in israel in order to fill the longitude gap between the moa - ii and ogle - iv @xcite .",
    "the wise survey uses a @xmath45 ccd camera mounted on the wise 1.0 m telescope . because of the wise observatory s latitude of @xmath46n",
    ", the wise survey can observe the bulge for no more than 5 hours per night . as a result",
    ", they have limited their high cadence survey observations to @xmath25 of the galactic bulge .",
    "in addition to these survey teams , most of the planetary and high magnification events are observed by the microlensing follow - up groups , such as the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ) , the @xmath47lensing follow - up network ( @xmath47fun ) , robonet and the microlensing network for the detection of small terrestrial exoplanets ( mindstep ) .",
    "originally , before the high cadence surveys came online , these follow - up programs were needed to get high cadence observations of the events thought to be most promising for planet detection , following the alert plus follow - up strategy laid out by @xcite .",
    "this strategy led to the discovery of number of high - magnification planetary events , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , as well as a couple of planetary signals in low - magnification events @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations were also used to help characterize planetary signals that were detected in progress in the moa - ii survey data @xcite .",
    "it is important to treat such follow - up observations carefully in a statistical analysis .",
    "if these observations are triggered by the detection of a planetary signal , they can not be used to increase the significance of the planetary signal above the planet detection threshold , because they were only taken because the planetary signal was already detected .",
    "the situation is different with the additional observations that are triggered by a high magnification alert .",
    "many high magnification events receive intensive observations from follow - up groups because they have much more sensitivity to planetary signals than low - magnification events .",
    "the crucial difference is that the additional observations for a high magnification events are triggered by this _",
    "high sensitivity _ and not an actual planetary signal .",
    "so , very high cadence observations of high magnification events are often planned before any planetary signal is detected , so it is possible to use the follow - up observations to set detection thresholds for a statistical analysis @xcite , as long as any observations taken in response to the detection of a planetary signal are not included .",
    "most planetary signals are presently found by the high cadence surveys , and moa - ii , as the first high cadence survey , began finding planetary signals in survey data back in 2007 ( or 2006 if non - alerted discoveries are included @xcite ) .",
    "but , with only a single high cadence observing site until 2010 , and only partial coverage of the moa high cadence fields afterwards , we have found that planetary signals identified in the moa - ii can often be characterized much better when follow - up data , as well as ogle and wise survey , are included in the light curve modeling .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we use only the moa - ii survey data for detection of potential planetary light curve anomalies , but we use all available data for characterization of the binary light curve parameters .",
    "in 2007 - 2012 , a total of 3300 microlensing alerts were issued by moa .",
    "most of the alerts are microlensing events , but some other types of transient events are also included . to determine the exoplanet mass ratio function , it is necessary to construct a sample of well characterized single lens and planetary events with good coverage by moa - ii survey observations .",
    "while it is possible to detect planets in events with a strong stellar binary signal @xcite , the analysis of such events is substantially more complicated , so we postpone such an effort to a later analysis .",
    "therefore , events that are strong stellar binary events or are obviously not due to microlensing are removed from our sample . however , we do not rely upon simple light curve inspection to distinguish between stellar binary and planetary binary microlensing events . instead",
    ", we have done a systematic analysis of the binary microlensing events in our sample to determine the best fit mass ratio , @xmath0 . after confirming that an event passes our binary or planetary detection criteria that the binary or planetary model should improve the fit @xmath48 by @xmath49 using the data on the moa alert page , we collect re - reduced data from all the observatories that have observed each event .",
    "this data is not used for determining which events pass our selection criteria , but it is used to find the best fit models that are used for event classification .    the modeling with these expanded data sets was performed with a grid search using the image - centered ray - shooting method @xcite",
    ". as discussed by @xcite , to find the best fit model , we searched a wide range of the parameter space using a variation of the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm @xcite , starting from 9680 grid points with fixed @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath50 ( @xmath1 : the projected separation normalized to the angular einstein radius , @xmath50 : the angle between the source trajectory and the binary lens axis ) .",
    "then , we searched @xmath51 minima of the best 100 models in order of @xmath51 in the first grid search with letting the each parameter free .",
    "we also included the microlensing parallax effect ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) to the model in this systematic analysis .",
    "678 events were analyzed with this modeling effort .",
    "independent modeling of all unpublished planetary events and possible planetary events was also performed using the initial condition grid method of @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we define planetary events to be ones with a best fit mass ratio of @xmath52 .",
    "we also check for degenerate solutions that have best fit @xmath48 values that differ by @xmath53 ( after the error rescaling as discussed below ) , and in these cases , we include all the models as possible models for the event . while a threshold of @xmath54 would be sufficient for gaussian statistics , since it would imply a probability of @xmath55% , we use a higher threshold in order to enable the possibility of testing our results for sensitivity to non - gaussian effects .",
    "we consider all possible solutions in bayesian analysis to determine the exoplanet mass ratio function . for any binary events that might be potentially planetary events , we attempt to improve the moa photometry with a variety of methods , in order to get the best possible event classification , and as mentioned in the last section , we include data from other groups .",
    "but , the anomaly detection is based on the data directly from the moa alert pages .",
    "the systematic modeling has recovered all the previously known planetary events and detected four new planetary events .",
    "one of these four events was previously published as a stellar binary event , but our systematic analysis showed that it is clearly a planetary event .",
    "the other three planetary events were newly discovered by the systematic modeling effort , and their planetary signals were missed in the years in which they occurred .",
    "our treatment of all these planetary events is discussed in section [ sub_sec_pla_eve ] .",
    "we find 23 planetary events ( including one ambiguous event ) and 1451 single lens events in our 6-year moa - ii survey data .",
    "this compares to 6 planets ( in 5 events ) and 8 single lens events in the high magnification sample of @xcite and 3 planets and 196 single lens events in 6 years of planet follow - up photometry of events alerted by ogle .",
    "one planetary event , ogle-2007-blg-349/moa-2007-blg-379 is common to all three analyses , but there is no other overlap in these planetary event samples .    here , we briefly summarize our classification of alert events .",
    "we classify the events into six categories : single lens , planetary , stellar binary , ambiguous , cataclysmic variable ( cv ) stars , and unknown events .",
    "single lens events have simple light curves , known as @xcite curves , and we use this simple light curve form to identify well characterized single lens events with the selection criteria given in table  [ tab : criteria ] as described in the following subsection . for planetary ( stellar binary ) events , following three conditions",
    "are required : the moa light curves are better fit by a binary lens model than a single lens model by @xmath56 ; the best fit mass ratio is smaller ( larger ) than 0.03 using all available data including ogle and other follow - up data , and the best fit model is better than stellar binary ( planetary ) solutions by @xmath57 .",
    "if the @xmath51 difference between the best planetary and stellar binary solution is smaller than @xmath58 , then the event is classified as an ambiguous event .",
    "the light curves of cvs are not well fit by both single lens and binary lens model , and their light curves are so characteristic that they can be classified by visual inspection . the events classified as",
    " other \" are ones that fail the selection criteria ( described in the next subsection ) due to such problems as poor light curve coverage or large systematic errors in the photometry .",
    "we avoid possible misclassification by setting our @xmath48 threshold to be @xmath49 , which is much higher than would be necessary if we were only concerned with gaussian random noise .",
    "there are at least two planetary candidates that have signals below this detection threshold , ogle-2007-blg-292/moa-2007-blg-190 and ogle-2012-blg-0724/moa-2012-blg-323 @xcite . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "these are treated as non - detections , and they are the price we pay for setting a threshold high enough to avoid misclassifications .      once the planetary , stellar binary events and cvs are removed from the sample ,",
    "the remaining events are the events classified as single lens or  other \" events . in order to consider only those events that allow the detection of planets with well - defined parameters",
    ", we apply a set of cuts , listed in table  [ tab : criteria ] on the remaining events .",
    "these cuts rely upon single lens microlensing fits to the online moa - ii data . in those cases where a finite - source microlensing model provides a better fit than a point - source model",
    ", we use the finite - source model for cuts given in table  [ tab : criteria ] . note that none of these criteria are related to the presence or absence of planetary light curve signals .    in order to search for planetary signals in the microlensing light curves , we require",
    "well constrained single lens microlensing fit parameters .",
    "otherwise , we can not tell what types of planets the light curve might be sensitive to .",
    "cut-1 and cut-2 impose these constraints and also exclude events that may not be due to lensing by stellar or brown dwarf primaries .",
    "the flux , f , in the moa online data is the delta - flux , which is the measured flux in the difference image , as computed by the difference image method @xcite .",
    "the flux error , fe , is the error bar computed by the photometry code , so cut-3 is a measure of the s / n of the primary microlensing signal above the baseline brightness .",
    "cut-4 requires a sufficient number of data points in the magnified part of the light curve to detect a planetary signal , and cut-5 ensures that there is reasonable coverage and a reasonable s / n on both the rising and falling sides of the light curve .",
    "we also want to avoid microlensing events which reach their single lens peak outside of or too close to the end of the season , and this is the rationale for cut-6 .",
    "cut-7 consists of three conditions that must be satisfied for the event to be accepted .",
    "all three conditions ensure that the event does not have large gaps in data coverage around the peak .",
    "the events failing cut-7 also have very low planet detection efficiency , so this cut has little effect on the total detection efficiency .",
    "the result of applying these cuts on our sample of 3300 microlensing events is that 1451 events pass all the cuts .",
    "these 1451 events consist of 226 , 230 , 247 , 288 , 184 and 276 events , respectively , in each year of the range 2007  2012 .",
    "since the selection criteria we use are not related to the presence or absence of planetary signals , the rejection of poorly sampled events induces no bias .",
    "our selection criteria do influence the properties of the distribution of stars that are searched for planetary signals , but this distribution is already influenced by unavoidable factors , such as observing conditions .",
    "some readers might be surprised at that only half of the observed events passed the event selection criteria , but this ratio is comparable to the previous studies . @xcite and @xcite used 45% and 49% of observed events for their analysis .",
    "@xcite used only 4% of the observed events due to the strict cuts they used .    the cumulative @xmath59 distribution for these 1451 events is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : te_dist ] , along with the distribution of events with planets .",
    "as we show in section  [ subsec : fun_te ] , the difference between these distributions is largely , but perhaps not entirely , a selection effect .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : te_dist ] shows these same distributions for the @xmath47fun @xcite and planet @xcite statistical analyses in red and blue , respectively .",
    "both show a similar bias toward planetary signals in long events , while the @xmath47fun distribution shows a slight bias toward longer events in the full sample , including single lens events .",
    "the full @xmath59 distribution for our sample is similar to that of the planet sample @xcite , which is only slightly skewed toward longer duration events , compared to our sample .",
    "the systematic modeling of all the anomalous events in our sample was conducted using all available data , including data from the ogle survey and follow - up groups .",
    "this effort found four new planetary events , as well as the known planetary events that have either been published or are in preparation for publication . in order to determine the significance of the planetary signals in the moa data , all the planetary events were fit with both single lens and planetary models using only the online moa data . for possible planetary signals discovered",
    "while they are in progress , moa often takes additional data in order to better characterize the parameters of candidate planetary microlensing events .",
    "we must be careful not to let these additional data affect the planetary detection statistics , because data taken in response to the detection of the planetary signal can not be used to determine the detection efficiency .",
    "so , the additional data taken in response to the anomaly detection are removed from the fits used to determine which events pass the anomaly detection threshold .",
    "the detection threshold fits use only the data taken at the standard moa survey cadence .",
    "we calculate the fit @xmath48 for the best fit single lens and binary lens models , and we renormalize the error bars to set @xmath60 for the best fit model .",
    "this process is necessary before using @xmath61 values as detection thresholds because the error bars provided by crowded field photometry codes are more accurate measures of the relative rather than absolute photometric accuracy .",
    "this procedure is commonly used in most of the previous microlensing analyses ( e.g.  muraki et al .",
    "then we calculate the fit @xmath48 for the best fit single lens and planetary binary lens models again with these renormalized error bars . if the difference between the renormalized @xmath62 values for the best fit single lens and the best fit planetary models is @xmath56 , then the event passes our detection threshold",
    ". there are four planetary events in the moa data set that do not pass this detection threshold cut because the planetary signals for these events were observed in other data sets , so that a significant planetary signal is not seen in the moa data .",
    "these events are moa-2007-blg-400 @xcite , moa-2008-blg-310 @xcite , moa-2011-blg-293 @xcite , and ogle-2012-blg-0724/moa-2012-blg-323 @xcite , and they are examples of lens systems with planets that are not detected because of the low planet detection efficiency of the moa data for these events .",
    "we require that our sample of planetary events should have that same good light curve coverage that we require for non planetary ( single lens ) events . for each possible planetary event ,",
    "an artificial single lens light curve is generated using the parameters of the best fit planetary model and the gaussian noise based on the residuals of the best fit model .",
    "then , our selection criteria ( see section  [ sub_sec_cri ] and table  [ tab : criteria ] ) are applied to each artificial single lens light curve for each candidate planetary event .",
    "we find that 23 events that are best fit by a binary lens model with a planetary mass ratio pass our cuts .",
    "however , for one of these events , there is a competing model with a stellar binary mass ratio that fits the data nearly as well .",
    "we classify this event as an  ambiguous event \" , which we treat in detail in section  [ sub_sec_amb_eve ] .",
    "this leaves the 22 clear planetary events , which we list in table [ tab : planet ] .",
    "it is the einstein radius crossing times , @xmath59 , of these 22 clear and 1 ambiguous planetary events that are plotted in figure [ fig : te_dist ] .",
    "the median @xmath59 value for the planetary sample is @xmath63days , compared to @xmath64days for the full sample .",
    "thus , the typical planetary event is 1.7 times longer than the typical well sampled event .",
    "this is primarily due to selection effects , as we discuss in section  [ subsec : fun_te ] .",
    "our sample of 22 clear planetary events includes four that were found for the first time by our systematic modeling effort . these events",
    "are ogle-2008-blg-355/moa-2008-blg-288 @xcite , moa-2008-blg-379/ogle-2008-blg-570 @xcite , moa-2010-blg-353 @xcite , and moa-2011-blg-291 @xcite . here",
    "are short descriptions of these four events .",
    "moa-2008-blg-288 : : :    this event was initially announced as a stellar binary event in an    analysis of ogle - iii archival data using only ogle survey data    @xcite .",
    "but , our systematic modeling of all the anomalous events    using all available data found that a planetary model is strongly    favored for this event , by @xmath65 .",
    "the moa    data cover a caustic exit that is critical for the correct    classification of this event .",
    "moa-2008-blg-379 : : :    this is a high magnification event with a faint source star ,    @xmath66 .",
    "the faintness of the source meant that the    strong anomaly at the peak dominated the apparent brightness    variation , and it was not immediately recognized as a high    magnification event . as a result",
    ", the planetary nature of the event    was not recognized in real time .",
    "the planetary feature is    characterized by the survey data alone .",
    "moa-2010-blg-353 : : :    this event has a relatively weak anomaly caused by the approach of the    source to a cusp of a major image planetary caustic . the peak    magnification is low and the source star is not so bright , and as a    result , the planetary anomaly for this event has the smallest    significance of all planetary signals that pass our threshold . the    ogle data does not cover the anomaly , but it helps to constrain the    non - planetary light curve parameters .",
    "moa-2011-blg-291 : : :    this is a high - magnification event that was alerted and observed by    the @xmath47fun follow - up group , as well as the moa , ogle ,    and wise survey telescopes .",
    "nevertheless , the planetary signal occurs    almost entirely in the moa and ogle data sets .",
    "this event was    identified as a possible planetary event shortly after the peak , but    it was not seriously investigated prior to our systematic analysis .    high magnification events ( @xmath67 ) account for 41% of our clear planetary event sample , compared to two of the three ( 67% ) planetary events in the planet sample @xcite and all 5 of the planetary events ( 100% ) in the @xmath47fun sample @xcite that are high magnification events .",
    "( but note that there is one high magnification event common to all three samples . )",
    "it is natural that analyses based on follow - up data will be dominated by high magnification events , because the planet detection efficiency per event is much larger for high magnification events than for low magnification events @xcite . for the microlensing follow - up results that have been published to date ,",
    "the total detection efficiency in the sample ( total sensitivity ) has been dominated by the high magnification events .",
    "high magnification events are relatively rare and the planetary caustics are usually larger than the central caustics , so signals from planetary caustics in low - magnification events are expected to dominate the planetary discoveries made in survey mode , and this is what we find with our sample .",
    "most high magnification planetary events suffer from close / wide separation degeneracy @xcite , because the shape of central caustic which depends on the mass ratio , @xmath0 and the absolute value of the logarithm of the star ",
    "planet separation , @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "so , the central caustics are nearly identical for separations of @xmath1 and @xmath69",
    ". there is a similar degeneracy with the location of the caustics for low - magnification events , but the shapes of the caustics for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are very different .",
    "thus , observations of low magnification events can generally break this @xmath72 degeneracy , and the separation is uniquely determined .",
    "this means that low - magnification planetary events are suitable for study of planet distribution as a function of separation beyond the snow line .",
    "more planetary signals in low magnification events will be expected in the future survey observation .",
    "the planetary signals that we detect in microlensing light curves are due to the source star crossing or approaching a caustic or cusp .",
    "the caustic crossing events are of special interest because caustic crossing features in the light curves allow us to measure the angular einstein radius , @xmath73 , as mentioned in section [ sec_intro ] .",
    "we find that @xmath74% of our planetary events do not include measured caustic crossings .",
    "this percentage is larger than the @xmath75 of published microlensing planet discoveries without measured caustic crossings , but it is substantially smaller than the @xmath76 of the planet detections predicted by simulation @xcite of a three - site high cadence survey like the korean microlensing telescope network ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kmtnet ) .",
    "this simulation makes a number of optimistic assumptions , but it illustrates the point that many of the planetary signals detected by higher sensitivity surveys will be in non - caustic crossing signals from higher mass ratio planets ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this is borne out by the non - caustic - crossing planetary deviations in our sample .",
    "but moa-2012-blg-527 @xcite is different from the other non - caustic - crossing planetary signals , because the source star crossed the demagnified region between the central caustic and two minor image , triangular planetary caustics .",
    "this region provides a strong negative perturbation that makes it easier to detect low mass ratio ( @xmath2 ) planets .    in these non - caustic - crossing events , the detection of finite source effects is difficult .",
    "so , the source radius crossing time is not well constrained for moa-2010-blg-353 ( with a @xmath78 signal ) , moa-2011-blg-322 @xcite , and moa-2012-blg-527 . however , the mass ratios are measured precisely in these events .",
    "this means that we must assume the source radius crossing times when calculating the detection efficiency for these events , but this assumption has no significant effect on the results we present in this paper .    in our planet sample ,",
    "five planetary events have not been published yet : moa-2010-blg-117 @xcite , moa-2011-blg-291(which is described above ) , moa-2012-blg-006/ogle-2012-blg-0022 @xcite , moa-2012-blg-355 ( ogle et al . in prep ) , and moa-2012-blg-505 @xcite . here , we briefly describe each event .",
    "moa-2010-blg-117 : : :    this is a low magnification event with a binary source star whose    trajectories crossed almost perpendicular to the minor image caustics .    the best fit planet model that assumes a single source star failed to    explain the demagnified part between the two triangular caustics . the    observed flux at the trough was brighter than the model",
    "this is well    fit by adding a bright companion to the source , and the binary source    model fits the data much better than a single source , triple lens    model , which could also explain the excess flux at the time of the    trough .",
    "this event was also observed by the ogle - iv survey , but ogle    did not announce any alerts in the first year of the ogle - iv survey .",
    "moa-2012-blg-006 : : :    this event was detected as an apparent short time scale event , but a    few month later the magnification rose again with a much longer    duration , but a lower amplitude . light curve modeling @xcite    indicates that the initial magnification was caused by a planet    located at @xmath79 , which is the largest separation    among the discovered microlensing planets except for    ogle-2008-blg-092lac @xcite .",
    "moa-2012-blg-355 : : :    this is a low magnification planetary event , but an rr lyrae star is    located very close to this event on the sky .",
    "it contaminates the light    curve , which slowed the identification of the planetary signal by a    couple days .",
    "the proximity to a known variable prevented its detection    in the ogle ews system .",
    "we removed the contamination from the moa and    ogle data , and the best fit model was found as shown in table    [ tab : planet ] .",
    "moa-2012-blg-505 : : :    this event is a short , high magnification event that was only observed    by moa .",
    "an anomaly lasting only a few hours over the light curve peak    was well covered due to moa s high cadence observing strategy . as    often occurs with high magnification events ,",
    "there is a close - wide    degeneracy , but it does not imply a large uncertainty in    @xmath1 because both values are close to 1 .",
    "false positives are generally not a problem for planetary microlensing signals , unlike the cases of planetary transit @xcite and rv @xcite signals",
    ". the only types of false positive that have been identified for planetary microlensing events are binary source stars @xcite and variable source stars microlensed at high magnification @xcite .",
    "both of these types of false positives are intrinsically rare because a binary companion to the source must be microlensed at high magnification to mimic a planetary microlensing event and because variable source stars are themselves intrinsically rare .",
    "furthermore , most planetary microlensing light curves have shapes that are not compatible with false positives . in our sample , only moa-2010-blg-353 has a light curve that might be compatible with a false positive .",
    "it is a low magnification event , so source variability with an amplitude large enough to mimic the microlensing signal would easily be seen in the baseline data , but a binary source might be a possibility . we fit a binary source model to this event and find a best fit @xmath48 that it is worse than the best fit planetary model by @xmath80 .",
    "the error bars during the moa-2010-blg-353 planetary signal are @xmath81% , which is well above the usual level of the correlated errors that are sometimes seen in microlensing light curves . thus , it is safe to exclude the binary source model for this event .",
    "errors in light curve modeling might also be considered to be false positives , but these are not a problem for our analysis because of our systematic modeling procedure .",
    "all anomalous events have been systematically modeled by at least two independent investigations , and potential planetary events have been modeled by at least three independent efforts . the recently published ogle event , ogle-2013-blg-0723 provides a good example of the effectiveness of the moa light curve modeling program .",
    "the initial paper @xcite claimed the discovery of a venus - mass planet orbiting a brown dwarf in a binary system .",
    "after this paper was published , the photometric data for this event was obtained from the authors , and one of us ( dpb ) began systematic modeling of the event , using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this systematic modeling effort quickly revealed the correct model , which includes only a stellar binary with no planet and a much smaller microlensing parallax signal .",
    "the authors of the original paper were contacted , and this resulted in a paper with the correct model @xcite .",
    "photometry for published events should be available permanently on the nasa exoplanet archive ( http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/ ) , while the data for all planetary events in this sample , including those that have yet to be published can be obtained directly from the first or second author .",
    "we define the mass ratio threshold @xmath52 as the upper limit for planetary events . binary lens systems with larger @xmath0 values",
    "are considered to be stellar binary events . however , for a number of events , there are several models that can fit the data . in most cases ,",
    "these degenerate models are caused by a well known degeneracy between different planetary models , such as the @xmath72 degeneracy discussed in section  [ sub_sec_pla_eve ] , but there can also be degeneracies between planetary and stellar binaries , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the events analyzed by @xcite , ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 , is in our sample .",
    "we can not arbitrarily ignore or accept such an event , because either choice would bias our measurement of the exoplanet mass ratio function .",
    "so , we include both possibilities in a bayesian analysis , as discussed below .",
    "our systematic analysis of all binary events turned up a number of other potentially ambiguous events , but further light curve analysis with optimized moa photometry revealed that most of these were unambiguous stellar binary events or contaminated by systematic photometry errors .",
    "events were classified as ambiguous based upon the @xmath48 values of the best fit stellar binary and planetary models ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively ) .",
    "these @xmath48 values are calculated with renormalized error bars to give @xmath84 , and we classify an event as ambiguous if @xmath85 . with this definition ,",
    "the only ambiguous event is the one identified by @xcite , ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 .",
    "the other possible ambiguous events did not pass our event selection cut .",
    "@xcite found that the planetary model was favored by @xmath86 , but considered the event to be ambiguous because of evidence for systematic photometry errors .",
    "our optimized photometry has removed much of these systematic photometry problems , but this also reduced the @xmath48 difference between the best stellar binary and planetary models to @xmath87 , favoring the planetary model .",
    "this is the difference between the best fit stellar binary and planetary models , but there are two models in each category , due to the close - wide degeneracy for high magnification events .",
    "the wide model is favored in each case , as can be seen in table  [ tab : ambiguous ] , which lists the light curve model parameters and fit @xmath48 values for each of the four ( approximately ) degenerate for this event .    the probability that this ambiguous event is due to a planetary system rather than a stellar binary depends both on the @xmath48 values for the respective fits and the prior probabilities of lens systems with the parameters of the best fit models .",
    "we define the relative fit probability of the stellar binary model to be @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the correct value if the observational uncertainties follow an uncorrelated gaussian distribution . when @xmath90 , this is equivalent to the likelihood ratio that is sometimes used for similar model comparisons @xcite .",
    "we can adjust @xmath91 in order to test the effects of non - gaussian uncertainties .    in order to determine the prior probability for the stellar binary model",
    ", we need to estimate the mass of the primary star , and we do this with a bayesian analysis using constraints from the observed @xmath59 values .",
    "we conduct the analysis with the same manner as used in the previous planetary events ( * ? ? ?",
    "the galactic model of @xcite was used for the prior .",
    "this yields a median primary star mass of @xmath92 .",
    "the period and mass ratio distribution for stellar binaries have been determined for solar type stars by @xcite and for low - mass stars by @xcite .",
    "since the likely primary mass for the ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 lens system is intermediate between the solar type and low - mass stars , we use the average value of the probability for solar type and low mass stars . for solar type stars ,",
    "the stellar multiplicity is @xmath93 , while for low - mass stars it is @xmath94 . for the probability of a planetary companion with the parameters indicated by each fit",
    ", we use our mass ratio function .",
    "the error bars in table  [ tab : ambiguous ] are also important , as they serve to determine the range in the mass ratio , @xmath0 , and separation , @xmath1 , that are consistent with the light curve data , and these factors tend to enhance the probability of the stellar binary interpretation , because the stellar binary models are consistent with a wider range of separations and mass ratios than the planetary models .",
    "the priors that we derived from these considerations were 0.196294 and 0.072682 for the wide and close planetary models and",
    "0.530297 and 0.200727 for the wide and close stellar binary models , respectively .",
    "in order to obtain the final probabilities for the different models we must multiply these priors by the relative probabilities , @xmath88 , for the different models . with the standard , @xmath90 , value for uncorrelated gaussian uncertainties , we find final probabilities of 0.825276 and 0.174628 for the wide and close planetary models and 0.000078 and 0.000017 for the wide and close stellar binary models , respectively . these values are used for our final results , but we have also considered the possibility of strong correlations or non - gaussianity in the photometric uncertainties . if we increase @xmath91 to @xmath95 , ten times the gaussian random value , then the relative probabilities become 0.375144 and 0.131346 for the wide and close planetary models and 0.363331 and 0.130179 for the wide and close stellar binary models , respectively .",
    "so , this would imply roughly equal probabilities for the planetary and stellar binary models .",
    "fortunately , even such an extreme assumption of correlated or non - gaussian errors , does not have a significant effect on our final results .",
    "the detection efficiency for a planetary signal in a microlensing event is denoted by @xmath96 .",
    "this is the probability that a planet with its mass ratio , @xmath0 at the projected separation ( in units of the einstein radius ) , @xmath1 , is detected , assuming a random orientation for the planetary system .",
    "following @xcite , we use the best fit single lens model for each event , while for events with planetary signals , we generate an artificial single lens light curve using the parameters of the best fit planetary model .",
    "we inject planetary signals with a complete range of parameters ( @xmath97 ) covering all of the potentially detectable signals to each single lens light curve .",
    "the generated light curves have same observation times as actual moa survey data .",
    "the error bars in each data point are re - normalized to be @xmath98 for the best single lens or planetary model as discussed in section [ sub_sec_pla_eve ] .",
    "note that any additional moa observations taken in response to a planetary signal are removed at this stage , as described in section [ sub_sec_pla_eve ] .",
    "for each of these generated light curves , we search for the best single lens model , we then calculate @xmath99 to determine if the planetary parameters give a large enough signal to pass our detection threshold .",
    "we do not need to calculate @xmath100 because it remans the same as the original @xmath51 for single lens fit without binary signature added .",
    "we use 360 grid points to cover the angle between the source trajectory and lens axis , @xmath50 , and define @xmath96 as the fraction of grid points for which @xmath101 .",
    "of course , we must use the same @xmath102 as we used as the detection threshold for the planetary signals , discussed in section  [ sub_sec_pla_eve ] .",
    "so , we set @xmath103 .",
    "microlensing is insensitive to inner planets with @xmath104 and has very low sensitivity for outer planets with @xmath105 , except in events where the microlensing signal of the host star is not directly detected @xcite .",
    "so , for the purpose of the detection efficiency calculations , we sample @xmath1 with 40 logarithmically spaced bins spanning the range @xmath106 . since we know that the detection efficiency depends smoothly on @xmath0 , we use 9 logarithmically spaced bins covering the range @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the total number of artificial light curves simulated for one event is 129600 . for the handful of events sensitive to planets with smaller mass ratios",
    ", we extend the grid down to @xmath108 .",
    "formally , if we assume that the photometric errors follow an uncorrelated gaussian distribution , then our detection threshold of @xmath103 corresponds to a false alarm probability of @xmath109 .",
    "however , we do not believe that our error bars follow an uncorrelated gaussian distribution .",
    "also , we want to ensure that the planetary signal is detected with enough s / n to provide reliable determinations of the planetary light curve parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that the analysis of high magnification events by @xcite used a much higher threshold , @xmath110 .",
    "however , this threshold was applied to data that was re - processed after a planetary signal was suspected . since some of the original data was reduced by dophot @xcite instead of more precise difference imaging photometry , the reprocessed data is likely to have a substantially larger @xmath61 than the original data .",
    "also , much of the data in the @xcite sample was taken with unfiltered telescopes .",
    "this means that these data are vulnerable to systematic photometry errors due to the color dependence of atmospheric transparency @xcite .",
    "finally , the high magnification events are often observed continuously all night , and this means that the effect of correlated photometric errors are much more significant than with the moa data , with a cadence of at most one observation every 15 minutes . for these reasons , @xcite",
    "thought that their higher threshold was reasonable for their analysis .",
    "the size of a source star is important for the detection of planets , because planetary light curve features are broadened and depressed with increasing source star size .",
    "the finite source effect is characterized by the source radius crossing time , @xmath34 , which is the time needed for the lens to cross the angular source star radius , @xmath111 .",
    "a larger source star has more chance to cross caustics , but it usually weakens the deviation from the single lens light curve . for the detection of planets with giant source stars and @xmath112 or main sequence sources and @xmath113",
    "the source star size is critical because the planet signals can be smoothed out by finite source effects @xcite .",
    "thus , finite source effects can have important effects on the detection efficiency , so we need to estimate @xmath34 for each event .    for the planetary event , we use the @xmath34 value from each paper or the best fit planetary model .",
    "although the @xmath34 is not well constrained for moa-2010-blg-353 , moa-2011-blg-322 and moa-2012-blg-527 , we used the @xmath34 of the best fit model .",
    "for the high - magnification events with lens stars passing over source stars , moa-2007-blg-176 , moa-2007-blg-233/ogle-2007-blg-302 , ogle-2008-blg-290/moa-2008-blg-241 , moa-2010-blg-436 , moa-2011-blg-093 , and ogle-2011-blg-1101/moa-2011-blg-325 , we use the @xmath34 value for each event from @xcite .",
    "also , we use the @xmath34 of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for ogle-2007-blg-050/moa-2007-blg-103 , ogle-2007-blg-224/moa-2007-blg-163 , ogle-2008-blg-279/moa-2008-blg-225 , moa-2009-blg-411 , moa-2010-blg-311 , moa-2010-blg-523 , moa-2011-blg-274 and ogle-2012-blg-0455/moa-2012-blg-206 , respectively . note that moa-2009-blg-411 and moa-2012-blg-206 are stellar binary events with a brown dwarf companion or possible planetary events , but the anomaly signals are found in the follow - up data , instead of moa data .",
    "so , they are treated as single lens events in this analysis .",
    "in addition to the above events , we use the best fit @xmath34 value estimated with all available data for the following events because they are probably showing the finite source effect : moa-2008-blg-383 , moa-2011-blg-393 , moa-2012-blg-278/ogle-2012-blg-1430 , ogle-2012-blg-0617/moa-2012-blg-285 , ogle-2012-blg-1098/moa-2012-blg472 , and ogle-2012-blg-1274/moa-2012-blg-538 . for the other single lens events , we need to estimate @xmath34 by estimating both @xmath111 and the relative lens - source proper motion , @xmath30 , since @xmath34 = @xmath114 . in most planetary microlensing events ,",

    "but , the source star magnitude in the moa - red passband , @xmath115 , is determined by the light curve model for each event .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the source star , @xmath116 , can then be estimated with the formula @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the apparent magnitude of red clump giant ( rcg ) centroid in the moa - red passband , and @xmath119 is the absolute magnitude of rcg centroid in the @xmath120-band .",
    "@xmath118 is estimated from the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the reference images in the @xmath121 and @xmath122-bands in each subframe ( 1k @xmath123 1k section of each ccd ) .",

    "we have computed the detection efficiency @xmath96 for each of the 1474 events that passed the event selection criteria discussed in section [ sec_eve_sel ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : dep1 ] - [ fig : dep3 ] show the detection efficiency for the planetary and ambiguous events . typically , each figure has roughly triangular sensitivity contours as first shown by @xcite , and subsequently shown by a number of subsequent studies @xcite .",
    "but , low magnification events tend to show a double peak toward lower mass ratios at @xmath71 and @xmath70 and reduced detection efficiency at the einstein ring radius ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "these features were also seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when we sum the detection efficiency for all the events in our analysis , we obtain the survey sensitivity , @xmath142 which is plotted in figure [ fig : sensitivity_s_q ] . the survey sensitivity @xmath143 is the number of planet detections that we expect with our 1474 events sample , if we assume the uniform planet distribution in @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    ". if our survey was dominated by well - sampled , high - magnification events , then the survey sensitivity contours would be nearly symmetric in @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "however , most of the sensitivity in our sample comes from more modest magnification events .",
    "this leads to higher sensitivity for planets with @xmath147 than for planets with @xmath148 .",
    "this is due to the fact that outer planets perturb the higher magnification  major \" image instead of the lower magnification  minor \" image . for a single lens event with magnification @xmath149",
    ", the major image has a magnification of @xmath150 while the minor image has a a magnification of @xmath151 , so when the magnification approaches @xmath152 , we can only expect to detect planets that perturb the major image .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sensitivity_s_q ] , most of the planets discovered in our data have separations close to the einstein radius , @xmath153 , and the distribution is pretty flat in @xmath145 with slightly more planets with @xmath154 than between @xmath155 . since we are less sensitive to planets with small @xmath0 values , this implies that lower mass planets are more common than more massive planets , at least down to @xmath2 .",
    "we can also define the survey sensitivity as a function of @xmath145 , by integrating @xmath143 over @xmath144 , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ fig : sensitivity_q ] shows the survey sensitivity , @xmath158 , where we have linearly interpolated the sensitivity between each calculated grid point .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in the sensitivity are negligible .",
    "the survey sensitivities estimated using the @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which are @xmath159 lower and upper values of @xmath136 , are also plotted in figure [ fig : sensitivity_q ] .",
    "we use the two - dimensional @xmath143 to determine the exoplanet mass ratio function in the following section , instead of the integrated , 1-dimensional survey sensitivity , @xmath158 .",
    "the planet - star mass ratio , @xmath0 , is measured in virtually all planetary microlensing events , while the masses can be sometimes determined by subtle microlensing parallax effects or follow - up observations with high angular resolution , but the masses of the lens stars and planets have not been measured for a large fraction of events .",
    "so , it is natural to determine the exoplanet frequency as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the projected separation , @xmath1 , is readily determined in units of the angular einstein radius , and it can generally only be determined in physical units for the same events that allow the determination of lens star and planet masses .",
    "our choice of parameters differs from that of @xcite , who attempted to determine the exoplanet frequency as a function of planet mass without the use of any mass measurements .",
    "so , the masses could only be estimated with a bayesian analysis that assumed that the planet frequency does not depend on the host star mass .",
    "we feel that simply reporting the mass ratio function is a better representation of the constraints of the exoplanet population from microlensing observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : q_func ] shows histograms of the the distribution of planet mass ratios in this analysis . the black histogram is the number of detected planets as a function of mass ratio , and the red histogram includes a detection efficiency correction that considers a poisson probability .",
    "so , the red histogram represents our estimate of the true planetary distribution , with 1 and 2-@xmath160 upper limits in the non detection mass ratio bins .",
    "note that these histograms are only for visualization .",
    "the unbinned data is used for the calculations that determine the mass ratio function .",
    "there are several features that are apparent from this distribution .",
    "first , the detected distribution is pretty flat down to @xmath2 or @xmath161 .",
    "this implies that the frequency of planets increases at small @xmath0 with a slope that nearly cancels the slope of the survey sensitivity function shown in figure  [ fig : sensitivity_q ] .",
    "however , it is also clear that this trend does not continue much below @xmath2 .",
    "an extrapolation of the slope of the sensitivity - corrected mass ratio function at @xmath162 toward @xmath163 passes well above the 2-@xmath160 upper limits for the bins with @xmath164 .",
    "this indicates that the power - law mass ratio functions used by @xcite and @xcite will not be able to explain our data .",
    "another shortcoming of the previous microlensing studies of @xcite and @xcite is that they did not have enough events to measure the separation dependence of the mass ratio function .",
    "this difficulty is exacerbated by the close / wide degeneracy for the high magnification events that dominate the @xcite and @xcite samples .",
    "in particular , only 2 of the 6 planets in the @xcite sample and 3 of the 8 planets in the @xcite had the close / wide degeneracy resolved .",
    "in contrast , the close - wide degeneracy is resolved in 17 of the 23 events in our sample due to the fact that most of the planetary signals in our sample were discovered through the planetary - caustic channel as expected for a high cadence survey .",
    "therefore , our sample can be used to measure the exoplanet separation distribution .",
    "the considerations above lead us to consider an exoplanet mass ratio function consisting of a power law in projected separation , @xmath1 , and a broken power - law in the mass ratio , @xmath0 , @xmath165 s^{m } , \\label{eq : expl_mrf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath166 is an average number of planets around a lens star , @xmath167 and @xmath15 are the power law indices for the mass ratio above and below the break in the mass ratio function at @xmath168 .",
    "the power law index for the separation is denoted by @xmath169 , and @xmath170 is the ( heavyside ) step function .    for events with multiple degenerate models that fit the data , we weight the different models with @xmath171 , where @xmath62 is the @xmath51 difference between the model in question and the best fit model .",
    "mostly , these degenerate models are close and wide models , but we also use a similar procedure for our ambiguous planetary event ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 , as discussed in section  [ sub_sec_amb_eve ] .",
    "we use a likelihood analysis to determine the exoplanet mass ratio function parameters , @xmath149 , @xmath9 , @xmath167 , @xmath15 , and @xmath169 .",
    "it is straight forward to derive the likelihood function from poisson statistics @xcite , and it is given by @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the number of planets detected for a mass ratio function model , @xmath174 , with the measured survey sensitivity , @xmath175 , defined in equation  ( [ eq : surv_sens ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath176 and @xmath177 refer to the mass ratio and separation ( in einstein radius units ) for each of the @xmath178 observed planets . the uncertainties in @xmath176 and @xmath177 are included as a two dimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "( this modified the model parameters by @xmath179-@xmath160 compared to a calculation that ignored the error bars . )",
    "the best fit exoplanet mass ratio function parameters are the ones that maximize the likelihood function , and they are shown in table  [ tab : expl_bmrf ] .    in order to derive confidence intervals for the exoplanet mass ratio function parameters using a bayesian approach",
    ", we must chose  prior distributions \" of these parameters , which are equivalent to the integration measure that we use to integrate over the the likelihood function , @xmath180 .",
    "we chose uniform priors for @xmath167 and @xmath169 , while for @xmath149 and @xmath9 we chose priors uniform in @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the power index , @xmath15 , for planets with small mass ratios , @xmath8 , presents a more difficult choice of a prior .",
    "we only have a small number of planet detections for @xmath183 , so mass ratio functions with @xmath9 close to the @xmath0 value of the lowest mass ratio planet in our sample are not strongly excluded by our data set .",
    "such models are consistent with very large @xmath15 values , which would imply that planets with @xmath184 are extremely rare .",
    "but , we know that such planets exist from _ kepler _ and solar system examples , and we also expect that it is relatively common for planets to change orbits due to gravitational interactions with other bodies . similarly , values of @xmath185 are also unlikely due to planetary scattering considerations .",
    "planet distributions determined from the _ kepler _ survey indicate that small planets are quite common in shorter period orbits @xcite , so there should be some small planets in wider orbits , if only due to planet - planet scattering .",
    "thus , it is sensible to chose a prior that disfavors priors with @xmath186 .",
    "hence , we chose a prior distribution that is uniform in hyperbolic arcsine .",
    "this prior reduces @xmath187 by about a factor of two , and changes the other parameters by much less than their error bars . the uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath1 for each planetary event are included as the noise model for this analysis , as discussed above .",
    "the maximization of the likelihood function was conducted with the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm to determine the best fit parameters and uncertainties for each parameter using the affine invariant mcmc ensemble sampler of @xcite .",
    "the best fit values are shown as crosses in figure  [ fig : mrf_contmoa ] , and they are also listed in table  [ tab : expl_bmrf ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : mrf_contmoa ] also shows scatter - plots and 68% and 95% confidence levels of the mcmc results , and table  [ tab : expl_mrf ] shows the median value and 68% confidence level for each parameter . although the uncertainty of the power - law index , @xmath15 is large , the power law break at @xmath188 is clearly detected .",
    "the best fit model with a broken power law function is favored over the single power law model by @xmath189 with two additional model parameters .",
    "the @xmath48 distribution with two degrees of freedom indicates that the single power - law model can be excluded with @xmath15-value of 0.0030 .",
    "however , this use of the @xmath15-value to estimate the evidence for the additional model parameters has been criticized as being insufficiently conservative .",
    "@xcite argue that it is better to use the bayesian evidence or bayes factor , which includes some accounting of the occam s razor preference for a simpler model .",
    "following @xcite , we can estimate the bayes factor as @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is @xmath15-value , and this yields a bayes factor of @xmath192 , implying that the broken power law model is favored by a factor of 21 over the single power law model .",
    "figure  [ fig : q_func ] shows the behavior of the exoplanet mass ratio function at @xmath141 .",
    "the uncertainties of the estimated finite source sizes for events without finite source are also statistically negligible .",
    "if we use the survey sensitivity estimated with @xmath137 values , the changes of the best fit model parameters are less than @xmath193 .",
    "if we use the @xmath138 values , which reduce the sensitivity for low - mass - ratio planets , the normalization , @xmath149 , changes by @xmath194 .",
    "it is clear from figures  [ fig : q_func ] and [ fig : mrf_contmoa ] that the amplitude and slope of the mass ratio function above the break at @xmath168 are pretty well constrained .",
    "but , the value of @xmath9 and the amplitude @xmath149 of the mass ratio ( measured at @xmath9 ) are not determined so precisely .",
    "the power - law index , @xmath15 , of the mass ratio function below the break is even more poorly determined .",
    "this is due to the small number of planets found with @xmath195 and the lack of planets with @xmath164 .",
    "the choice to normalize the mass ratio function at @xmath168 allows us to write the mass ratio function , equation  ( [ eq : expl_mrf ] ) in a more compact way , but it also increases the apparent uncertainty in the mass ratio function at larger @xmath0 values .",
    "therefore , we introduce the parameter @xmath196 , shown in table  [ tab : expl_mrf ] and figure [ fig : q_func ] with the blue point , to indicate the uncertainty in the normalization at the mass ratios where microlens planets are more typically found .",
    "microlensing has the potential to determine the exoplanet mass function beyond the snow line as a function of host mass and galactocentric distance , but this requires additional information such as microlensing parallax @xcite or detection of the lens star @xcite . while such measurements exist for some of the planets in our sample , our analysis does not use this information . nevertheless , we can still explore the dependence of the exoplanet mass ratio function on the one microlensing parameter , @xmath59 , that depends on the mass and galactocentric distance of the host star .",
    "shorter @xmath59 events can be caused by low - mass lens stars or a combination of a high lens - source relative velocity and a small lens - source distance .",
    "these later conditions hold for lens systems in the galactic bulge , and a systematic trend of planet properties with @xmath59 would likely indicate a trend in planet properties with host star mass or galactocentric distance , or some combination of the two effects .",
    "( the mass and distance estimates alluded to in the previous paragraph are needed to break this degeneracy between lens mass and distance . )    in this section , we investigate the planet frequency as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "the median of @xmath59 is @xmath197 days for microlensing events toward the galactic bulge , but the median of @xmath59 for planetary events is @xmath198 days , as shown in figure [ fig : te_dist ] .",
    "this effect is largely explained by the higher planet detection efficiency for long @xmath59 events , as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : te_eff ] .",
    "but , it is possible that planets favor long @xmath59 events , even after correction for the detection efficiency .",
    "if planets favor long @xmath59 events , it could imply that cold planets are more common orbiting massive stars , galactic disk stars , or both .",
    "note that it is important that we have selected only evens with robust @xmath59 measurements in order to avoid systematic errors associated with large @xmath59 uncertainties .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : te_eff ] shows the detection efficiencies @xmath199 in the @xmath59 - @xmath0 plane .",
    "the detection efficiency is averaged over 0.5 dex bins in both @xmath200 and @xmath145 for visualization .",
    "the detection efficiency is larger for long @xmath59 and higher @xmath0 values .",
    "but , the number of events drops for @xmath201days due to the small number of long @xmath59 events in our sample .",
    "so our sensitivity to planets in longer events drops , as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : te_eff ] .",
    "this panel shows the survey sensitivity , which is the sum of the detection efficiency for each event , in 0.5 dex bins in both @xmath200 and @xmath145 .",
    "the survey sensitivity is highest for events with @xmath202 where both the detection efficiency and the number of events are relatively high .",
    "we expect any trend with @xmath59 to be relatively weak , because @xmath59 depends on the lens primary mass and distance , as well as the lens - source relative transverse velocity .",
    "thus , even a strong trend with host mass of galactocentric distance could be partially washed out by the variation of the other variables that @xmath59 depends on . with only 22 or 23 events",
    ", we do not have a great deal of sensitivity to subtle variations in the planet frequency with @xmath59 , so we divide the planetary events into two mass ratio ranges ; the 14 planets with @xmath203 , and 9 planets with @xmath204 .",
    "the planets in the lower mass range have masses less than that of jupiter mass , and are mostly cold neptunes , while the planets in the later mass range are jupiters and super - jupiters . as in section [ subsec : fun_q_sep ] , we define @xmath205 as a number of planets per star per logarithmic event timescale , @xmath206 where @xmath166 is an averaged number of planets around a lens star for the two mass ratio ranges .",
    "the parameters @xmath207 and @xmath208 are the normalization and slope for the assumed power law function , respectively .",
    "we select a pivot point of @xmath209days .",
    "we use a likelihood analysis to determine @xmath207 and @xmath208 with an assumption of uniform priors .",
    "the likelihood function is just the poisson probability of finding the observed number of events , @xmath178 , times the product of the probability of finding events with each of the observed event timescale , @xmath210 , @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the detection efficiency in each 0.5 dex @xmath59 bin , and @xmath173 is the number of events expected for the given @xmath207 and @xmath208 values , integrated over @xmath213 . we find that the power law index @xmath208 is flat for both mass ratio ranges : @xmath214 for @xmath215 , and @xmath216 for the range with @xmath217 , as shown in figure [ fig : te_func ] .",
    "so , the mass ratio function is flat or slightly increasing with @xmath59 .",
    "the normalizations are @xmath218 for @xmath215 and @xmath219 for @xmath217 .",
    "a larger survey will be evidently be needed to measure the @xmath59 dependence of the cold exoplanet mass ratio function .",
    "previous attempts to measure the exoplanet mass ratio or mass function using microlensing data have used more limited samples than we have used in this paper .",
    "the first attempt was the measurement by @xcite of the slope of the exoplanet mass ratio function using only relative and not absolute detection efficiencies .",
    "@xcite used the 10 microlensing discoveries known at that time to estimate logarithmic mass ratio function slope of @xmath220 , which is consistent with our value of @xmath221 for the mass ratios @xmath222 .",
    "but , without the break in the mass ratio function , it appears that the events with @xmath8 have flattened their mass function slope .",
    "@xcite used 13 high magnification events containing 6 planetary signals for the first microlensing analysis with absolute detection efficiencies .",
    "these events were selected based on their observation by the @xmath47fun microlensing follow - up collaboration they did not solve for a slope with mass ratio , and they find @xmath223 at an average mass ratio of @xmath22 , assuming a distribution that is flat in both @xmath145 and @xmath144 . as shown in figure  [ fig : a_func ] , the @xmath47fun result is a factor of @xmath224 higher than our result when evaluated at the central @xmath0 for the @xmath47fun analysis .",
    "our value is 1.2@xmath225 below the @xmath47fun result , and less than 1-@xmath226 when the combined moa and @xmath47fun error bars are used .",
    "however , our mass ratio function has a different functional form than theirs .",
    "so , a better comparison would be to integrate our mass ratio functions over a range of mass ratios centered at @xmath22 . in order to avoid the complication associated with the break",
    ", we select the range extending from @xmath227 to @xmath228 , a factor of 2.5 in each direction from the central value .",
    "our mass ratio function average over this @xmath229-@xmath230 range is 0.226 , which compares to the @xmath47fun value of @xmath231 .",
    "so , our value is 37% lower .",
    "our mass ratio function is fully consistent with the earlier @xmath47fun measurement , so there is no need to identify a bias to explain the fact that our value is lower .",
    "however , we have identified such a bias , nonetheless .",
    "this is a  publication date \" bias .",
    "that is , the publication date for the @xmath47fun sample was not decided in advance .",
    "instead , it was selected , in part , because the authors judged that they had discovered enough planets for such a paper .",
    "such a decision is more likely after a few years or two with a higher than average planet detection rate .",
    "however , we have identified a possible bias , nonetheless .",
    "@xcite found 6 planets in 4 years of data for a rate of 1.5 per year , but the following 6 years of observations yielded only 3 planets with @xmath47fun data @xcite that pass the criteria of @xcite , when we would have expected 9 .",
    "event ogle-2013-blg-0341 does not qualify for this sample because of its stellar binary signal is much stronger than the signal of the planet @xcite .",
    "there are also several recent strong planetary events with important @xmath47fun data that are excluded from this list of planets because they have @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "so , it is likely that an update of the @xcite analysis will yield a result closer to our moa result .",
    "the possibility of a similar bias affecting our own analysis seems to be smaller because our sample is larger .    while the previous analyses of @xcite and @xcite dealt with exoplanet mass ratio , @xmath0 , as our analysis does , @xcite attempted to derive the exoplanet mass function .",
    "they find @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is semi major axis , @xmath31 is the planetary mass , and @xmath235 is the mass of saturn , @xmath24 .",
    "the planet collaboration @xcite analysis includes constraints from @xcite and @xcite , and it uses a bayesian analysis , rather than mass and distance measurements to convert from mass ratios to masses .",
    "this can be somewhat misleading , as it makes the assumption that exoplanet properties do not depend on the mass or distance of the host star .",
    "since no mass measurements are used , we feel that it is more sensible to convert the @xcite result back to mass ratios instead of masses .",
    "this can be done trivially because a power law mass function transforms into a power law mass ratio function .",
    "( this applies for every mass , so it applies for all masses . )",
    "however , we must note that @xcite do not correctly estimate the median mass that their survey probes for planets .",
    "they estimate the median mass corresponding the event with the median @xmath59 in the detection efficiency sample .",
    "however , the planet detection efficiency is higher for longer @xmath59 events , so the sensitivity is increased for longer events .",
    "since the planet occurrence rate is only weakly sensitive on @xmath59 , as shown in figure  [ fig : te_func ] , we can use the median value of @xmath59 for the detected planets , which is @xmath236 days for the 23 events in the moa sample , as well as the combined moa+@xmath47fun+planet sample discussed below . with the galactic model of @xcite ,",
    "this corresponds to a median mass of @xmath237 .",
    "this is more appropriate median mass for the planet sample , so we use it to convert the @xcite mass function back into a mass ratio function .",
    "this converted result ( which is used for only this comparison , not for the following subsection ) is compared to our result and the @xmath47fun analysis in figure  [ fig : comprv ] .",
    "the planet result is obviously consistent with our mass ratio function .",
    "the most recent statistical analysis of microlensing exoplanet data is the @xcite analysis of the combined moa , ogle and wise 2011 - 2014 microlensing survey data set .",
    "this analysis is rigorous in the sense that the detection efficiency for binary and planetary microlensing events is calculated , but the analysis of the detected binary and planetary microlensing events is incomplete .",
    "some of the binary and planetary events have had a complete analysis done in other papers , and the results of these published analyses are used when they are available .",
    "but , for the other binary and planetary events , the light curve analysis has been limited to a coarse grid in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this results in light curve models that obviously , by eye , do not fit the data for many of their binary and planetary events , including ogle-2011-blg-0481 , ogle-2011-blg-0974 , ogle-2012-blg-0442 , ogle-2014-blg-0257 , ogle-2014-blg-0572 , ogle-2014-blg-0676 , ogle-2014-blg-1255 , and ogle-2014-blg-1720 , which could lead to incorrect statistical inferences about planetary system properties .",
    "for example , ogle-2011-blg-0481 is a stellar binary , but the model presented in @xcite is a planetary model with @xmath238 .",
    "ogle-2014-blg-0676 is correctly classified as a planetary event , but @xcite estimate a mass ratio of @xmath239 whereas the full analysis by @xcite finds @xmath240 , a difference of a factor of 3.4 .",
    "they used 9 planets including the above one to find a mass ratio slope of @xmath26 , which is only marginally consistent with our slope of @xmath241 with @xmath242 .",
    "they also find that the average number of planets per star is @xmath243 with @xmath27 and @xmath244 .",
    "this compares to 0.43 planets per star with the same range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 values for our combined mass ratio function , discussed in the next section .",
    "our analysis includes 22 planetary events and one likely planetary event , which compares to 6 and 8 events used in the previous statistical analyses of exoplanet microlensing data sets @xcite .",
    "however , 7 of the 8 events used in these previous analyses are not included in our sample .",
    "( the planetary event , ogle-2007-blg-349 is included in all three samples . ) thus , we can increase our sample to 29 - 30 planets by adding these samples to the moa sample .",
    "this is straightforward to do because @xcite and @xcite have made their survey sensitivity functions , @xmath143 and detection efficiencies , @xmath96 , available to us .",
    "( to compute the survey sensitivity as a function of the semi - major axis and planet mass , @xcite converted their detection efficiencies as a function of @xmath144 and @xmath145 to those of physical parameters .",

    "we then simply multiply the likelihood functions , equation  ( [ eq : q - s ] ) , for the three different surveys together to get our final likelihood function .",
    "the only complication is the overlap between the three surveys .",
    "we deal with this by removing the 2007 season from the planet sample and removing the events in the @xmath47fun analysis from the moa sample .",
    "we make these choices because the moa 2007 season has a higher sensitivity than the planet 2007 season and because the inclusion of the follow - up data gives the @xmath47fun analysis higher sensitivity for the 13 events in their sample , despite their higher detection threshold .",
    "the results of this combined analysis are summarized in tables  [ tab : expl_bmrf ] and [ tab : expl_mrf ] , as well as figures  [ fig : q_func_all ] and [ fig : mrf_contall ] .",
    "the mass ratio function parameters from this combined sample are very similar to the parameters from the moa - only sample .",
    "again , the uncertainties in mass ratio and separation for the additional planets from @xcite and @xcite are negligible .",
    "they change the best fit model by 10 % of the uncertainties for each parameter . with this combined sample , the best fit",
    "broken power - law model is a better fit than the best single power law model by @xmath245 ( with 2 additional parameters ) .",
    "this implies a @xmath15-value of 0.0022 , and a bayes factor of 27 , implying that the broken power - law model is favored over the single power - law model by a factor of 27 .",
    "the normalization is increased by @xmath246% or @xmath247 when @xmath9 is fixed , and the @xmath9 value is decreased somewhat when @xmath9 is set as a free parameter . as expected , the larger sample decreases the error bars slightly .",
    "we can also use this combined sample to look at the number of planets implied by our mass ratio function .",
    "microlensing has been traditionally thought to be sensitive to planets in a so - called  lensing zone \" @xcite , which roughly spans the range @xmath244 .",
    "if we integrate our best fit mass ratio function for the combined sample ( shown in figures  [ fig : mrf_contall ] and table  [ tab : expl_bmrf ] ) , we find 0.48 planets per stars inside the  lensing zone .",
    "\" however , some of these planets have @xmath248 , which is below the lowest mass ratio for any planet in our combined sample . if we consider only planets in the range of our known microlens planets , with @xmath249 , we find 0.33 planets per star . on the other hand ,",
    "10% of the combined microlens exoplanet sample are located outside the nominal @xmath244  lensing zone . \" to include all the planets in our sample , we must use an extended  lensing zone \" spanning the range @xmath250 .",
    "our mass ratio function predicts 0.79 cold planets per star with @xmath249 and 1.26 cold planets per star if we extrapolate our mass function down to @xmath251 .",
    "our microlensing mass ratio function results are more readily compared with the results of rv surveys than transit surveys because both microlensing and the rv method detect exoplanet masses rather than the radius , which is detected by the transit method .",
    "we consider five different rv studies in refereed journals that report statistical results @xcite .",
    "all of these studies have smaller exoplanet sample than our combined sample except for @xcite and possibly @xcite , and none of them have an exoplanet sample more than a factor of two larger than our sample .",
    "two of these studies @xcite focus on planets orbiting stars of @xmath252 in short period orbits ( period @xmath253days ) , and so they have no overlap with our planetary microlens sample",
    ". however their sensitivity does extend down to @xmath254 , where these results are consistent with the mass ratio function measured with our microlensing at much larger orbital separations , as shown in figures  [ fig : comprv ] and [ fig : comprv_all ] .",
    "the study by @xcite had the largest sample ( 48 planets ) and covered periods of @xmath255 days ( corresponding to @xmath256 for solar mass host stars ) , but they have little sensitivity to planets less massive than jupiter in wide orbits .",
    "so , they were sensitive primarily to planets with shorter period orbits than the planets probed by the microlensing method , and their host stars are more massive than most of the planets found by microlensing",
    ". nevertheless , our results do agree well with their slope with separation , as indicated in figures  [ fig : a_func ] and [ fig : a_func_all ] . while the @xcite slope with semi - major axis was consistent with the microlensing result of @xcite , the agreement with our result",
    "is somewhat better .",
    "however , our constraint on the slope of the mass ratio function is rather weak , @xmath257 for the complete sample , so it is consistent with a logarithmically flat distribution ( @xmath258pik s law ) at 1-@xmath160 .",
    "this is due to the relatively narrow range of planetary separations that most microlensing observations are sensitive to , as well as the close - wide degeneracy that occurs for high magnification events that are sensitive to planets at a wide range of separations .",
    "in contrast , microlensing is sensitive to a large range of exoplanet mass ratios .",
    "our detected planets span a range of 500 in mass ratio , and we have significant sensitivities at masses below the planet with the lowest observed mass ratio",
    ". the @xcite result does not match our more precise measurement of the dependence of the mass ratio function on @xmath0 at @xmath259 , where their value is lower than our measurement , as our mass ratio function rises more steeply towards lower mass ratios than theirs does , as indicated in figures  [ fig : comprv ] and [ fig : comprv_all ] .",
    "this may be an indication that there are more cold neptunes beyond the snow line that have undergone little or no migration than there are at @xmath260au .",
    "the rv studies of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite focused on m - dwarf primaries , although with rather small samples of 5 , 11 , and 14 planets , respectively .",
    "@xcite finds a significantly lower occurrence frequency than we find , but this is largely due to the limited mass and separation sensitivity of their rv survey .",
    "in contrast , using some of the same data , @xcite find an occurrence rate consistent with our measurements .",
    "( see figures  [ fig : comprv ] and [ fig : comprv_all ] . )",
    "they have been much more careful to consider the rv selection effects and the possible signals of planets with periods longer than the survey .",
    "@xcite also searched for the planets orbiting m - dwarfs using the harps instrument , and found planets spanning a range of 300 in mass and 150 in semi - major axis , but only two of these planets are in the range of periods , @xmath261 ",
    "@xmath262 days , where microlensing is sensitive",
    ". however , only one of the two planets were confirmed by the harps survey ( as pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "so , we consider only one planet discovery to plot the @xcite results in figures  [ fig : comprv ] and [ fig : comprv_all ] .",
    "a recent study by @xcite , simulated rv observations of the planet population found by microlensing showed that the number of rv detections expected by the simulation agrees with the actual rv observation of @xcite .",
    "however , this was a comparison to the @xcite mass function , so it is not a direct comparison with our results .",
    "high contrast imaging is a promising method to determine the frequency of exoplanets in wide orbits , but their sensitivity is currently limited to self - luminous planets , and their published statistical results tend to be upper limits @xcite .",
    "so , this method does not yet have a great deal of overlap with the primary sensitivity region for the microlensing method at 2-@xmath263 the snow line .",
    "by far , the largest statistical samples of planets with well - characterized detection efficiencies come from the _ kepler _ mission @xcite , but _",
    "kepler _ provides only a direct measurement of the planet radius and not mass for the vast majority of planets discovered . not only that , but the _ kepler _ planets for which both the radius and mass are measured are biased on sample of planets .",
    "masses are more readily determined by rvs for more massive planets in short period orbits , but the smaller planets are considered to be more interesting .",
    "so , much observing time is devoted to planets that are thought to have barely detectable rv signals .",
    "transiting planet masses can also be determined by transit timing variations , but many of the transit timing variation measurements are made for an unusual class of low - density planets that are tightly packed in highly co - planar orbits @xcite .",
    "these planets might have different compositions and therefore a different mass - radius distribution from planets in more sparsely packed , less co - planar systems .",
    "also , attempts to determine the mass - radius relation have generally not spanned the full range of planet masses . at masses near a jupiter - mass and above ,",
    "the physics of electron degeneracy pressure conspires to make the planet radius nearly independent of the planet mass ( but still dependent on the planet composition ) .    as a result of these considerations",
    ", we have limited our comparison to _ kepler _ to a simple comparison of the masses of the mass function breaks or peaks seen in each data set . for _ kepler _ , we use the exoplanet radius functions of @xcite for g and k host stars and @xcite for m - dwarf hosts . to convert to masses",
    ", we use the probabilistic mass - radius relation of @xcite in both cases .",
    "the exoplanet mass functions derived from @xcite and @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : exmp_kepgkm ] .",
    "only the red and blue colored part of the curves in this figure are reliable . both of these exoplanet mass functions have a similar shape in the region where both are reliable , @xmath264 .",
    "the mass functions for m and g , k host stars have apparent peaks at @xmath265 and @xmath266 , respectively .    because there are few microlens planets below the mass ratio function break at @xmath267",
    ", we do not have a very precise measure of @xmath9 . from table  [ tab : expl_mrf ] , we see that the 1-@xmath160 range is roughly 0.5-@xmath268 .",
    "since the typical host star mass is @xmath269 , for our detected planets ( in both the moa and combined samples ) @xmath270 corresponds to @xmath271 , which is just above the mass of neptune .",
    "thus , the break in the mass function beyond the snow line is likely to occur at a mass in the range 10-@xmath272 .",
    "this is likely to be somewhat higher than the apparent mass function peaks in shorter period orbits , as estimated from _ kepler _",
    "data , but we will need a larger sample of low - mass microlens planets to confirm that the break in the mass function at higher masses beyond the snow line .    we can also compare the absolute numbers of planets found by _",
    "kepler _ at separations well inside the snow line to our values well outside the snow line .",
    "we focus on the planets near the peak of the mass ratio function and the _ kepler _ radius functions . from the @xcite sample , we consider planets in the period range @xmath273 .",
    "this spans a factor of 8 in period , which is equivalent to a factor of 4 in separation , by kepler s 3rd law . using the mass - radius relation we select lower limits for @xmath274 for the @xcite sample as equivalent to a lower limit of @xmath275 in our analysis .",
    "we find 0.27 planets per star when we sum the @xcite bins between @xmath273 with @xmath274 .",
    "the equivalent range for our exoplanet mass ratio function ( equation  ( [ eq : expl_mrf ] ) with the parameters from the @xmath9 free - all column from table  [ tab : expl_bmrf ] ) is @xmath276 and @xmath244 . integrating over this range yields 0.38 planets per star , suggesting that the peak of the exoplanet mass function of cold planets might have @xmath277% more planets than an equivalent size region near at the peak of the warm planet distribution for g and k stars .",
    "we can also do a similar calculation with the tabulated radius function of @xcite for early m - dwarf host stars . to match the bins of their tabulated radius distribution , we select @xmath278 and @xmath279 to span the same logarithmic range in separation and mass ratio as planets at the peak of the m - dwarf exoplanet radius function with @xmath280 with @xmath274 .",
    "integrating over this @xmath281 gives 0.43 planets per star found by microlensing , as compared to a whopping 3.03 planets per star near the peak of the early m - dwarf radius function .",
    "this dramatic difference between the height of the peak in the radius function is also seen by @xcite , but they also point out that some potentially large systematic errors may still exist in these analyses .",
    "the masses of the lens stars are not known for the vast majority of microlensing events in our sample , but the situations is somewhat better for the lens stars found to host planets . for most planetary events , finite source effects",
    "are seen , and this allows the angular einstein radius to be determined . when the angular einstein radius is known , the lens mass can be determined in those cases where the microlensing parallax effect can be measured .",
    "this has been done for 6 events in our sample , moa-2007-blg-192 @xcite , ogle-2007-blg-349/moa-2007-blg-379 @xcite , moa-2009-blg-266 @xcite , moa-2010-blg-117 @xcite , moa-2010-blg-328 @xcite , and moa-2011-blg-197/ogle-2011-blg-0265 @xcite , as well as one event with two planets , ogle-2006-blg-109 @xcite , from the @xcite sample .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible to determine lens mass with a measurement of the angular einstein radius or microlensing parallax along with the measurement of the host star brightness . with the help of an empirical or theoretical mass - luminosity relation ,",
    "the host star brightness can be turned into a lens mass measurement .",
    "this has been done using microlensing parallax for ogle-2012-blg-0950/moa-2012-blg-527 in our sample @xcite .",
    "it also has been done using the angular einstein radius for ogle-2005-blg-169 @xcite and ogle-2006-blg-109 @xcite in the @xcite sample and for ogle-2005-blg-071 @xcite in the @xcite sample .",
    "the observations that detect the lens are often taken many years after the event , as this allows us to check that the putative lens star motion is actually consistent with being the lens .",
    "we plan to include these mass constraints in a future analysis .",
    "the host star masses in the planetary events in our sample mainly range from g - dwarfs to late m - dwarfs .",
    "the primary lens masses in moa-2011-blg-262 @xcite could be a jupiter mass object , although a low mass star is more likely . also , the primary lenses for ogle-2007-blg-224/moa-2007-blg-163 @xcite and moa-2011-blg-274 @xcite , both of which are single lens events and used to estimate the detection efficiency , are very likely to be brown dwarfs or possibly a planetary mass object in the case of moa-2011-blg-274 .",
    "thus , conservatively , the host star mass in our analysis is ranging over late - type stars extending to both g - dwarfs and brown dwarfs , or even planetary mass objects .",
    "we have reported the planet frequency as a function of planet - to - star mass ratio , separation , and event time scale , derived from the microlensing survey data by moa - ii telescope in 2007 - 2012 .",
    "this sample included 1474 well sampled microlensing light curves , and we find signals of 22 planets and one likely , but not certain , planet ( see section  [ sec_eve_sel ] ) .",
    "our sample probes the planetary systems of stars that can serve as lenses for gravitational microlensing surveys towards the galactic bulge , so it is an average over stars that orbit inside the solar circle .",
    "it is possible that this population is somewhat different from the neighbors that can be probed by the other detection methods .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous statistical microlensing analyses of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but we find that , contrary to previous analyses , the data are not consistent with a single power - law mass function in the mass ratio , @xmath0 . instead , we find a strong change in the slope of the mass ratio function at @xmath267 , which we model as a broken power - law mass function , given by equation  ( [ eq : expl_mrf ] ) or @xmath282 with the best fit parameters given in table  [ tab : expl_bmrf ] and the markov chain medians and error bars given in table  [ tab : expl_mrf ] .",
    "we present results for the 23-planet moa sample , and the full sample of 30 planets ( including one somewhat ambiguous event ) .",
    "the @xmath15-values for the detection of the break in the mass ratio function are 0.0030 and 0.0022 for the moa and full samples , respectively . a more conservative estimate of the need for the power - law break in the mass function ratio is given by the bayes factors of 21 and 27 favoring the broken power law for the moa and full samples .",
    "these bayes factors imply that the broken power - law model is favored over the single power - law model by these factors .",
    "we present our results in terms of the planetary mass ratio , @xmath0 , instead of mass because the mass ratio is measured robustly in virtually all planetary microlensing events . converting mass ratios to masses",
    "requires the use of a galactic model and an assumption about how the prevalence of planets might depend on galactocentric distance and host star mass .",
    "the common assumption is that there is no dependence on either , but this is motivated by our nearly complete ignorance of these dependencies . by presenting our results in terms of the mass ratio ,",
    "we avoid invalidating them by making incorrect assumptions regarding the distance and host mass dependence of the mass ratio function .",
    "nevertheless , it is sometimes useful to consider what mass might correspond to a particular mass ratio , such as the mass ratio of the break in the mass ratio function .",
    "since our typical planet host star has a mass of @xmath283 , @xmath267 corresponds to @xmath284 , with an uncertainty of about a factor of two .",
    "this break in the mass ratio function seems to be at a somewhat larger mass than the breaks or peaks that appear in _ kepler _ populations , with planetary radii converted to masses following @xcite , but a larger sample of low - mass microlens planets is needed to confirm this .",
    "our analysis is the most comprehensive systematic statistical analysis of the exoplanet occurrence frequency using planetary signals discovered in a microlensing survey . the previous analyses relied on planet detections by follow - up groups , which have a lower detection rate , and therefore , smaller samples . in the years since the moa - ii high cadence survey started ,",
    "several other high cadence surveys have commenced , including the ogle - iv survey @xcite , the wise survey @xcite , and the kmtnet survey @xcite .",
    "an even more powerful improvement to the statistical study of planetary systems found by microlensing will be to include all the existing constraints on the mass and distance to the lens systems .",
    "in particular , the lens system masses can often be measured when the microlensing parallax effect is detected @xcite , which can be done much more easily with follow - up telescopes located far from the earth @xcite . for events without giant source stars , it is also possible to determine the lens system mass and distance by detecting the lens star in high angular resolution follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these constraints will allow us , for the first time , to determine the dependence of the properties of cold exoplanets as a function of host star mass and galactocentric distance .",
    "the ultimate word on the statistical properties of planetary systems will be achieved from the space based exoplanet survey @xcite of the _ wfirst _",
    "@xcite mission , and hopefully also the _ euclid _ @xcite mission .",
    "the high angular resolution of these space telescopes will allow mass and distance determinations of thousands of exoplanets because it will be possible to detect the lens star and measure the lens - source relative proper motion with the high resolution survey data itself .",
    "this will give us the same comprehensive picture of the properties of cold exoplanets that _ kepler _ is providing for hot planets .",
