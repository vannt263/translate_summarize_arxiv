    "among the most important goals of present and future colliders is the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and the origin of fermion masses .",
    "if the introduction of one or more higgs fields is responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , then at least one higgs boson should be relatively light , and certainly in the range of energies of present ( tevatron ) or future ( lhc ) hadron colliders .",
    "the present lower bounds on the higgs boson mass from direct searches at lep2 are @xmath4  gev ( at @xmath5 cl ) @xcite for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , and @xmath6  gev and @xmath7  gev ( at @xmath5 cl , @xmath8 excluded ) @xcite for the light scalar ( @xmath9 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath10 ) higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . at the same time",
    ", global sm fits to all available electroweak precision data indirectly point to the existence of a light higgs boson , @xmath11  gev @xcite , while the mssm requires the existence of a scalar higgs boson lighter than about 130  gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility of a higgs boson discovery in the mass range around 115 - 130  gev seems increasingly likely .    in this context",
    ", the tevatron will play a crucial role and can potentially discover a higgs boson in the mass range between the present experimental lower bound and about 180  gev @xcite .",
    "the dominant higgs production modes at the tevatron are gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath12 ) and the associated production with a weak boson ( @xmath13 ) . because of small event rates and large backgrounds ,",
    "the higgs boson search in these channels is extremely difficult , requiring the highest possible luminosity .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate all possible production channels , in the effort to fully exploit the range of opportunities offered by the available statistics .",
    "recently , attention has been drawn to the possibility of detecting a higgs signal in association with a pair of top - antitop quarks at the tevatron , i.e. in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this production mode can play a role over most of the higgs mass range accessible at the tevatron .",
    "although it has a small event rate , @xmath15  fb for a sm - like higgs boson , and even lower for an mssm higgs boson , the signature ( @xmath16 ) is quite spectacular .",
    "furthermore , at the tevatron , after fully reconstructing both top quarks , the shape of the invariant mass distribution of the remaining @xmath17 pair is quite different for the signal and for the background .",
    "the statistics is too low to allow any direct measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling , but recent studies @xcite indicate that this channel can reduce the luminosity required for the discovery of a sm - like higgs boson at run ii of the tevatron by as much as 15 - 20% .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath14 has been known at tree - level for quite some time @xcite . as for any other hadronic process , next - to - leading ( nlo )",
    "qcd corrections are expected to be important and are crucial in order to reduce the dependence of the cross section on the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "preliminary indications of the magnitude of the nlo qcd corrections can be obtained in the framework of the effective higgs approximation ( eha ) , where terms of order @xmath18 and @xmath19 are systematically neglected in the computation @xcite .",
    "this approximation correctly reproduces the collinear bremsstrahlung of the higgs boson from the heavy top quarks .",
    "however , we expect the eha to be more reliable at the lhc center - of - mass energies , for which it was originally proposed , than at the tevatron center - of - mass energies .",
    "we will briefly discuss the predictions of the eha for @xmath20 in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we also notice that qcd corrections to the associated production of a higgs boson with a pair of @xmath21 quarks , which is dominated by the @xmath22 channel , have been computed in the limit of large @xmath23 @xcite , by resuming the leading @xmath24 terms . however this result can not be applied to the @xmath25 production of a relatively light higgs boson at the tevatron , both because the ratio @xmath19 is of @xmath26 and does not justify the large @xmath23 limit , and because the @xmath27 channel is negligible for @xmath28 production at the tevatron .    in this paper we present in detail the calculation of the nlo inclusive total cross section for @xmath14 , @xmath29 , in the standard model , at the tevatron center - of - mass energy . for @xmath30 collisions at hadronic center - of - mass energy @xmath2  tev ,",
