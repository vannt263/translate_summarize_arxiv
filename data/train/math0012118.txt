    "a modern perspective on @xmath0-manifolds is through topological quantum field theory , following ideas of jones , witten and many others .",
    "these have inspired tremendous activity but so far have not contributed much to the topological understanding of @xmath0-manifolds . in particular , the vassiliev - goussarov theory of finite type invariants of knots , which in some sense gives universal quantum knot invariants , has developed a fascinating life quite independent of the rest of geometric topology .",
    "which low - dimensional topologist hasnt been inspired by the appearance of unitrivalent graphs in the enumeration of these finite type invariants ?",
    "these graphs ultimately derive from the feynman rules associated to perturbative chern - simons theory , and the residue of gauge symmetry introduces certain relations on the diagrams , now known as _ antisymmetry- _ and _ jacobi- _ ( or ihx- ) relations . on the other hand , it is well known that rooted unitrivalent _ trees _ can be used to label iterated ( non - associative ) operations , and that the above relations arise exactly for lie algebras . in our context the most interesting lie algebras arise from a group @xmath6 by first considering its _ lower central series _",

    ", one should rather think of the associated graded lie algebra @xmath10 and thus it is not surprising that the notion of grope cobordism is closely related to finite type knot invariants .",
    "we shall make this statement precise and hence our results can be viewed as the long desired _",
    "geometric _ interpretation of finite type knot invariants .",
    "this relation between grope cobordism and finite type invariants was first announced by habiro at the very end of his landmark paper @xcite . without providing proofs",
    ", he correctly announces a version of theorem  [ capped ] below , but makes an incorrect assertion about ( uncapped ) grope cobordism .",
    "the correct statement is our main result , theorem  [ main ] .",
    "our proofs of these theorems rely heavily on habiro s work .",
    "other geometric interpretations of finite type invariants include stanford s beautiful work @xcite on the relationship with the lower central series of pure braid groups @xmath11 .",
    "stanford shows that two knots in 3-space have the same finite type invariants of degree  @xmath12 if and only if they differ by a finite sequence of operations as follows : grab any number @xmath13 of strands of one knot and tie them into a pure braid in the @xmath14-th term of the lower central series of @xmath11 .    the first relation between finite type invariants and gropes",
    "was announced by kalfagianni and lin in @xcite .",
    "their notion is very different from ours since they consider gropes in 3-space whose first stage bounds a knot and is embedded with free complementary fundamental group .",
    "however , arbitrary intersections are allowed among the higher grope stages . in that context the precise relation between grope class and vassiliev degree is not understood and only a logarithmic estimate is given in @xcite . in his thesis @xcite , the first author discovered a more precise relationship between finite - type invariants and gropes .",
    "there he proved that a knot bounding an _ embedded _ grope of class @xmath14 in 3-space must have vanishing finite type invariants up to @xmath15 , and that this bound is the best possible .",
    "the methods of the thesis are applied in the short note @xcite to get a similar result for gropes with more than one boundary component .",
    "this result is an ingredient of the proof of theorem  [ main ] below .",
    "we first want to motivate the use of gropes from scratch , without any reference to quantum invariants .",
    "recall that the fundamental group of an arbitrary topological space @xmath16 consists of continuous maps of the circle @xmath17 into @xmath16 , modulo homotopy ( i.e.@xmath18-parameter families of continuous maps ) .",
    "quite analogously , classical knot theory studies smooth _ embeddings _ of a circle into 3-space , modulo isotopy ( i.e.  @xmath18-parameter families of embeddings ) .",
    "recall further that a continuous map @xmath19 represents the trivial element in the fundamental group @xmath20 if and only if it extends to a map of the disk .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 represents a commutator in @xmath20 if and only if it extends to a map of a surface ( i.e.  of a compact oriented 2-manifold with boundary @xmath17 ) .",
    "the first statement has a straightforward analogy in knot theory : a knot is trivial if and only if it extends to an embedding of the disk into 3-space .",
    "however , every knot `` is a commutator '' in the sense that it bounds a _ seifert surface _ , i.e.  an embedded surface in 3-space .",
    "thus all of knot theory is created by the difference between a surface and a disk .",
    "the new idea is to filter this difference by introducing a concept into knot theory which is the embedded analogue of iterated commutators in group theory .",
    "namely , there are certain finite 2-complexes ( built out of iterated surface stages ) called _ gropes _ by cannon @xcite , with the following defining property : @xmath19 represents an element in the @xmath14-th term of the lower central series of @xmath20 if and only if it extends to a continuous map of a _ grope of class  @xmath14_. by construction , such gropes have a single circle as their boundary , but one can also consider gropes with more boundary circles as in figure  [ fig : grope ] .    gropes , therefore , are not quite manifolds but the singularities that arise are of a very simple type , so that these 2-complexes are in some sense the next easiest thing after surfaces .",
    "two sentences on the history of the use of gropes in mathematics are in order , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2.11 ) .",
    "their inventor stanko worked in high - dimensional topology , and so did edwards and cannon who developed gropes further .",
    "bob edwards suggested their relevance for topological 4-manifolds , where they were used extensively , see @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "it is this application that seems to have created a certain angst about studying gropes , so we should point out that the only really difficult part in 4 dimensions is the use of _ infinite constructions _ ,",
    "i.e.  when the class of the grope goes to infinity .",
    "the idea behind a _ grope cobordism _ is to filter the difference between a surface and a disk in 3-space .",
    "the following definition should be thought of as a 3-dimensional _ embedded _ analogue of the lower central series of a group .",
    "let @xmath22 be the set of oriented knot types , i.e. isotopy classes of oriented knots in 3-space .",
    "def : grope cobordism two knot types @xmath23 are _ grope cobordant _ of class  @xmath14 , if there is an embedded grope of class  @xmath14 ( the _ grope cobordism _ ) in 3-space such that its two boundary components represent @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    at first glance , gropes do nt appear to embed in an interesting way in @xmath0-space .",
    "however , since every grope cobordism has a 1-dimensional spine , it can then be isotoped into the neighborhood of a 1-complex . as a consequence ,",
    "grope cobordisms abound in 3-space !",
    "an example of such a grope cobordism of class three is given in figure  [ fig : realisticgrope ] .",
    "this is an embedded version of the grope on the right of figure  [ fig : grope ] , except that all surface stages are of genus one .",
    "the genus one surface with two boundary components is the thin , partially transparent surface .",
    "one symplectic basis element , the core of one of the thin bands , is glued to the boundary of the thicker genus one surface .",
    "it is important to point out that the two boundary components of a grope cobordism may link in an arbitrary way , but that we do not record this information .",
    "it turns out ( lemma  [ lem : equivalence relation ] ) that the relation of grope cobordism is in fact an equivalence relation ( for each fixed class  @xmath14 ) on the set @xmath22 of knot types .",
    "this is why we were careful to talk about _ knot types _ rather than actual knots .",
    "moreover , the resulting quotients are extremely interesting abelian groups under connected sum . before explaining these groups in detail , we want to point out a way to directly relate to finite type knot",
    "invariants a l vassiliev , see @xcite or @xcite . for that purpose",
    ", we have to consider _ capped _ gropes which are gropes with disks ( the _ caps _ ) as their top surface stages .    if two knots cobound an _ embedded capped _",
    "grope then they are isotopic because the caps can be used to surger the grope cobordism into an annulus .",
    "thus in order to get an interesting notion of _ capped grope cobordism _ , we allow the ( disjointly embedded ) caps to have intersections with the bottom stage of the embedded grope .",
    "the proof of this result has two ingredients .",
    "one is habiro s beautiful translation of finite type invariants into his theory of tree claspers @xcite , and the other is our translation from tree claspers to capped gropes given in theorem  [ claspers - gropes ] .    in section  [ sec : grope refinement ] we will prove that it is sufficient to consider gropes which have genus one in all stages except at the bottom .",
    "the genus at the bottom is responsible for the transitivity of the grope cobordism relation .",
    "another simplification is predicted by group theory : since the lower central series of a group is generated by commutators which are `` right - normed '' , the question arises as to whether ( capped ) grope cobordism is generated by the corresponding _ half - gropes _ , see figure  [ fig : half ]",
    ". this question will be answered in the affirmative in section  [ sec : ihx ] .    even though capped grope cobordism is very useful because of theorem  [ capped ] ,",
    "the analogy with group theory is more natural in the absence of caps .",
    "thus the question arises whether grope cobordism ( without caps ) can also be translated into the finite type theory . in order to explain how this can be done",
    ", we first have to review an approach to finite type knot invariants developed by goussarov , habiro and others .",
    "again the starting point are certain feynman diagrams , i.e. unitrivalent graphs .",
    "the main idea is to think of such graphs as operating on the space of knots as follows .",
    "consider a unitrivalent graph @xmath26 embedded in 3-space , with exactly its univalent vertices on a knot @xmath27 , its edges framed and each trivalent vertices cyclically ordered .",
    "there is a procedure to replace @xmath26 by a framed link in the complement of @xmath27 , with a copy of the hopf link at each edge of @xmath26 and a copy of the borromean rings at each trivalent vertex .",
    "see section  [ sec : claspersdefs ] .",
    "surgery on that link replaces the knot @xmath27 by a new knot type @xmath28 , the _ surgery of @xmath27 along @xmath26_. in the simplest case where @xmath29 has a single edge , one recovers the original idea of a crossing change on a knot : surgery on a single hopf link leads to the knot @xmath30 which differs from @xmath27 by a single crossing change . the next simplest case is shown in figure  [ fig : intro8 ] .",
    "varying the embeddings and framings of a given graph , one obtains an infinite class of operators on the set @xmath22 of oriented knot types in 3-space , indexed by abstract unitrivalent graphs .",
    "assume that each such graph @xmath31 is equipped with a _ degree _ @xmath32 .",
    "then one obtains a descending filtration @xmath33 defined as follows : @xmath34 consists of all knots that can be obtained from the unknot by a finite sequence of surgeries along unitrivalent graphs @xmath26 of degree @xmath35 .",
    "there is also a natural notion of the quotients @xmath36 : these are defined to be the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation on @xmath22 generated by surgeries along rooted unitrivalent graphs of degree @xmath37 .    as an example",
    ", one can use the _ vassiliev degree _",
    "@xmath38 to obtain exactly the well known _",
    "vassiliev filtration _ used in theorem  [ capped ] : the main theorem of @xcite states that two knots represent the same element in @xmath39 if and only if they share the same vassiliev invariants of degree @xmath40 .",
    "this follows from the fact that a surgery on a unitrivalent graph is the same as a _ simple clasper surgery _",
    ", compare section  [ sec : claspers ] . in this language ,",
    "theorem  [ capped ] can be reformulated as follows :      the vassiliev degree is also used as the degree in defining a version of graph cohomology .",
    "then it turns out that the differential in this chain complex preserves another degree , namely the _ loop degree _ @xmath42 , the `` number '' of loops in @xmath26 .",
    "regardless of its relation to graph cohomology , one can use the loop degree to obtain a second filtration @xmath43 of the set of knot types .",
    "it turns out that in our context the _ grope degree _",
    "@xmath44 is most relevant , leading to the precise uncapped analogue of theorem  [ capped ] :        * the grope degree arises naturally as follows . given a unitrivalent graph @xmath31 , there exists a set of @xmath46 edges such that cutting these edges yields a trivalent tree .",
    "the grope degree of @xmath31 is precisely the vassiliev degree of this tree ( which is the same as the degree of the tree in the sense of the lower central series ) . *",
    "the groups @xmath47 are well known to be isomorphic to the corresponding diagram spaces via the kontsevich integral .",
    "in particular , the kontsevich integral is an invariant of capped grope cobordism . *",
    "garoufalidis and rozansky @xcite have proven the remarkable result that the kontsevich integral also preserves the `` loop filtration '' @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , the kontsevich integral also preserves the grope filtration @xmath49 ( in the sense that it sends the @xmath14-th term @xmath50 to a linear combination of diagrams with grope degree @xmath51 ) .",
    "hence the kontsevich integral gives obstructions to the existence of grope cobordisms .",
    "* in fact , the groups @xmath52 are isomorphic to the corresponding diagram spaces ( via the kontsevich integral ) just like for the vassiliev degree .",
    "this result will be explained in @xcite .",
    "it shows how interesting , yet understandable , the relation of grope cobordism in 3-space is .",
    "moreover , it also gives a geometric interpretation of the kontsevich integral ! * using the methods of @xcite one shows that all quotients , @xmath41 and @xmath45 , are finitely generated abelian groups under connected sum .",
    "hence the same is true for the quotients of knots modulo ( capped ) grope cobordism .",
    "* in the preceding theorems we are dividing out by graphs which have grope degree",
    "_ larger than _ or equal to @xmath14 .",
    "in fact the theorems are also true if we only divide out by those of exactly degree @xmath14 . for the vassiliev degree",
    "this is contained in @xcite , for the grope degree we shall give a proof in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ main ] will be proven by explaining the precise relation between an embedded grope and the link obtained from a rooted unitrivalent graph . at the heart of the issue lies a well known relation between borromean rings and surfaces and more generally between iterated bing doublings of the hopf link and gropes of higher class .",
    "this relation has been used extensively in 4-dimensional topology and it has also occurred previously in the study of milnor invariants of links , see for example @xcite .",
    "the following result is our main contribution to theorems  [ capped ] and [ main ] .",
    "it uses an obvious generalization of grope cobordism in 3-space to arbitrary @xmath0-manifolds and also the language of _ claspers _ which makes the `` surgery on unitrivalent graphs '' from the previous section more precise .      *",
    "two knots are @xmath53-grope cobordant in @xmath54 if and only if they are related by a finite sequence of @xmath53-clasper surgeries . *",
    "two knots are capped @xmath53-grope cobordant in @xmath54 if and only if they are related by a finite sequence of capped @xmath53-clasper surgeries .        by a result of ng @xcite , no finite type knot invariant but",
    "the arf invariant is a concordance invariant .",
    "the analogous result for links can be very well expressed in terms of the loop degree and its relation to gropes . even though our ( grope ) proof is new , the following result seems well known to experts .",
    "compare in particular the rational analogue of habegger and masbaum @xcite and the homological version of levine @xcite .",
    "this result says that in the 4-dimensional setting , it is best to consider rooted trivalent _ trees _ instead of all graphs as operators .",
    "we will thus concentrate on trees from now on ( by the stu - relation trees are sufficient for the vassiliev theory @xmath58 as well , see @xcite ) . note that grope degree ( or grope class )",
    "agrees in this case with the vassiliev degree . in this setting the vassiliev invariant of degree 2 , corresponding to the letter @xmath59 has been generalized to an invariant of immersed @xmath60-spheres in @xmath61-manifolds by schneiderman and teichner @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the fundamental group ( i.e. the edges of the letter @xmath59 are labeled by elements of the fundamental group with a holonomy relation around each trivalent vertex ) and is a second order obstruction for embedding a single @xmath60-sphere or mapping several @xmath60-spheres disjointly into a @xmath61-manifold .",
    "it is expected that higher order invariants of this type can be constructed for all labeled trees , modulo antisymmetry , holonomy and ihx - relations .",
    "returning to knots , it turns out that a slight refinement of the theory _ does _ allow concordance invariance .",
    "the idea is to allow surgery only along _ symmetric _ trees , corresponding to _ symmetric _ grope cobordism .",
    "these are related to the derived series rather than the lower central series of the fundamental group .",
    "symmetric trees have a new complexity called the _ height _ @xmath1 ( and the class @xmath14 , defined for any rooted tree , is given by the formula @xmath62 ) .",
    "recently , cochran , orr and teichner defined a highly nontrivial filtration @xmath63 of the knot concordance group .",
    "they prove in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.8.11 ) that two knots represent the same element in @xmath63 if they cobound an embedded symmetric grope of height @xmath64 in @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that a symmetric grope cobordism in 3-space can be used to obtain such a grope cobordism in 4-space .",
    "thus the following consequence implies that the casson - gordon invariants vanish on @xmath66 and that the higher order von neumann signatures of @xcite are invariants of @xmath67 .",
    "4d define a filtration @xmath68 on @xmath22 by allowing symmetric trees of height @xmath69 as operators .",
    "then the natural map from @xmath22 to the knot concordance group maps @xmath70 to the term @xmath63 in the cochran - orr - teichner filtration .      instead of studying symmetric gropes",
    ", one can also restrict attention to any particular grope type , parameterized by the underlying rooted tree type .",
    "the precise definition can be found in section  [ sec : equivalence ] .",
    "what follows is a summary of our low degree calculations whose proofs will be found in @xcite .",
    "consider a grope cobordism of tree type @xmath53 ( and class @xmath14 ) between two knots @xmath24 and @xmath25 in 3-space .",
    "the preceding theorem  [ refine ] allows us to reduce each of these to a sequence of @xmath53-clasper surgeries with leaves of only two possible good types , together with claspers of higher degree .",
    "applying theorem  [ refine ] again to these higher degree terms , and iterating , we obtain a sequence of claspers of degrees @xmath14 to @xmath71 each of which has only the two good types of leaves , together with some claspers of degree  @xmath72 . by theorem  3 of @xcite a rooted clasper @xmath73 of degree",
    "@xmath72 preserves vassiliev - goussarov equivalence of degree  @xmath14 .",
    "then , by the main theorem of @xcite , surgery on @xmath73 can be realized as a sequence of simple tree clasper surgeries of degree @xmath14 .",
    "recall that a _",
    "simple _ tree clasper in habiro s sense has by definition only the simplest type of leaf , namely bounding a cap which intersects the knot once .",
    "this is one of the good leaf types from theorem  [ refine ] .",
    "thus we get a sequence of tree claspers in degrees  @xmath14 to @xmath71 each of which only has the two good types of leaves . for each such tree clasper , convert the hopf - linked pairs of leaves to edges ( or half - twisted edges ) .",
    "observe that the resulting graph claspers are simple , i.e. they are capped and the knot intersects each cap in exactly one point . let @xmath6 be the graph type of one of these simple claspers .",
    "then the loop degree @xmath74 is the number of hopf - linked pairs of leaves because we started with a tree @xmath75 and glued up pairs of tips .",
    "each such gluing reduces the number of vertices by two and hence the grope degree is unchanged from @xmath75 to @xmath6 : @xmath76.\\ ] ] this implies that @xmath77=[k_2]\\in { \\mathcal{k}}/{\\mathcal{f}}^g_c$ ] because by definition the equivalence relation corresponding to @xmath78 is generated by simple clasper surgeries of grope degree  @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath73 is a simple clasper of type @xmath6 ( and grope degree  @xmath14 ) , then we can convert @xmath74 edges into hopf - linked leaves as in figure  [ fig : morse1 ] to obtain a simple tree clasper of the same grope degree , which now has class @xmath14 . picking any leaf as the root",
    ", our main construction , theorem  [ claspers - gropes ] , gives a grope cobordism of class @xmath14 .",

    "[ refine ] ( case ( k ) is all that is needed ) to a capped tree clasper , we get a sequence of _ simple _ tree claspers of the same type ( and hence class ) .",
    "this uses the fact that the algorithm never introduces intersections between a cap and the clasper .",
    "thus two knots which are capped grope cobordant of class  @xmath14 do represent the same element in @xmath80 ( the equivalence relation generated by simple clasper surgeries ) .",
    "conversely , if two knots represent the same element in @xmath80 , then by habiro s main theorem they are also related by a sequence of simple _ tree _ clasper surgeries of class  @xmath14 , and thus they are capped grope cobordant of class  @xmath14 . @xmath79",
    "turn the simple clasper @xmath73 into a tree clasper by converting some edges into hopf - linked pairs of leaves .",
    "notice that all the resulting leaves bound disks into the complement of @xmath56 .",
    "picking a root of @xmath73 , and hence the corresponding component @xmath81 of @xmath56 , this gives a @xmath0-dimensional grope cobordism between @xmath56 and @xmath82 .",
