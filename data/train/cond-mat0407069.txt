    "the pressure - induced quenching of the jahn - teller distortion and metal - insulator transition in lamno@xmath0 were recently studied @xcite by synchrotron x - ray diffraction , optical spectroscopies , and transport measurements under pressures up to 40 gpa .",
    "this work stresses that the delocalisation of electron states is a key feature of lamno@xmath0 in the pressure range of 20 - 30 gpa . in this paper",
    "we present calculations which show that the delocalisation of electron states goes through a phase of charge disproportionation where mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath3 coexist .",
    "interest in perovskite manganites@xcite was recently rekindled due to the observation of colossal negative magnetoresistance in la@xmath4camno@xmath0.@xcite the half - metallic character of la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath0@xcite is an important factor which results in a magnetoresistance ratio of more than 1800% at 4k .",
    "the phase diagram of la@xmath4srmno@xmath0 is complex,@xcite revealing the competition between the double exchange and superexchange interactions , charge and orbital ordering instabilities and strong coupling to the lattice deformations .",
    "furthermore it has been argued that local jahn - teller effects , such as random jahn - teller distortions of the mno6 octahedra,@xcite and dynamical effects@xcite are of importance to explain the magnetic properties of these materials .",
    "recently banach and temmerman@xcite showed that under sr doping the delocalisation transition from the valence mn@xmath1 , as seen in lamno@xmath0,@xcite to the valence mn@xmath3 is characterised by a transition region extending up to 20% sr where mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath3 coexist in a charge disproportionated state .",
    "these lsmo systems were cubic and therefore the jahn - teller distortion did not play a role in this .",
    "similar results are also obtained by calculations of korotin _",
    "et al._@xcite who show for la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath0 the occurrence of orbital order and insulating behaviour in the ferromagnetic state without any jahn - teller distortion .    in this paper",
    "we study whether a delocalisation of mn@xmath1 to mn@xmath3 also occurs , under pressure , in the cubic phase of the parent compound lamno@xmath0 and if such a pressure - induced transition is also characterised by a region of mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath3 coexistence . concerning the jahn - teller distortion , which is ignored in the present study , it was included in the study of the electronic properties of lamno@xmath0 by tyer",
    "_ et al._@xcite .",
    "it was found in that work that the jahn - teller interaction is the dominant effect in realizing orbital order , which is not considered in this work .",
    "sic - lsd calculations are performed for lamno@xmath0 in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and anti - ferromagnetic a ( af - a ) - which is anti - ferromagnetic ordering in the ( 001 ) direction - structures at different volumes to study the localization of the mn d states .",
    "these calculations are performed for different configurations of localized states as a function of volume . in particular configurations where",
    "the 3d mn t@xmath9 states are localised will be considered as well as 3d mn t@xmath9 and 3d mn e@xmath10 of 3z@xmath11-r@xmath11 symmetry . by doubling the unit cell in the z - direction we can also investigate in the af - a structure and a mn@xmath1/mn@xmath3 charge ordered state with the same structure .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the next section we explain the sic - lsd formalism and give some calculational details .",
    "the third section contains our results and discussions and the fourth section summarizes the paper .",
    "the basis of the sic - lsd formalism is a self - interaction free total energy functional , @xmath12 , obtained by subtracting from the lsd total energy functional , @xmath13 , a spurious self - interaction of each occupied electron state @xmath14@xcite , namely @xmath15 here @xmath16 numbers the occupied states and the self - interaction correction for the state @xmath16 is @xmath17+e_{xc}^{lsd}[\\bar{n}_{\\alpha } ] , \\ ] ] with @xmath18 $ ] being the hartree energy and @xmath19 $ ] the lsd exchange - correlation energy for the corresponding charge density @xmath20 and spin density @xmath21 .",
    "the sic - lsd approach can be viewed as an extension of lsd in the sense that the self - interaction correction is only finite for spatially localised states , while for bloch - like single - particle states @xmath12 is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the lsd minimum is also a local minimum of @xmath12 .",
    "a question now arises , whether there exist other competitive minima , corresponding to localised states , which could benefit from the self - interaction term without loosing too much of the energy associated with band formation .",
    "this is often the case for rather well localised electrons like the 3@xmath22 electrons in transition metal oxides .",
    "it follows from minimisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) that within the sic - lsd approach such localised electrons move in a different potential than the delocalized valence electrons which respond to the effective lsd potential .",
    "for example , in the case of manganese , three ( mn@xmath3 ) or four ( mn@xmath1 ) mn @xmath22 electrons move in the sic potential , while all other electrons feel only the effective lsd potential .",
    "thus , by including an explicit energy contribution for an electron to localise , the ab - initio sic - lsd describes both localised and delocalized electrons on an equal footing , leading to a greatly improved description of static coulomb correlation effects over the lsd approximation .    in order to make the connection between valence and localisation more explicit",
    "it is useful to define the nominal valence as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the atomic number ( 25 for mn ) , @xmath25 is the number of core ( and semi - core ) electrons ( 18 for mn ) , and @xmath26 is the number of localised , i.e. , self - interaction corrected , states ( either three or four for mn@xmath3 and mn@xmath1 respectively ) .",
    "thus , in this formulation the valence is equal to the integer number of electrons available for band formation . to find the valence we assume various atomic configurations , consisting of different numbers of localised states , and minimise the sic - lsd energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the number of localised electrons .",
    "the sic - lsd formalism is governed by the energetics due to the fact that for each orbital the sic differentiates between the energy gain due to hybridisation of an orbital with the valence bands and the energy gain upon its localisation . whichever wins determines if the orbital is part of the valence band or not and in this manner also leads to the evaluation of the valence of elements involved . in the present work",
    "the sic - lsd approach , has been implemented @xcite within the linear muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) band structure method , @xcite in the tight - binding representation .",
    "in fig . [ energyvsvol ] we show the total energy versus volume for two different magnetic structures and three different states of charge order .",
    "these are the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic ( along the z - direction ) magnetic orders .",
    "the charge order refers to trivalent mn@xmath1 , tetravalent mn@xmath3 and a disproportionated state of mn@xmath1/mn@xmath3 .",
    "this disproportionated state mn@xmath1/mn@xmath3 consists alternate mno@xmath2 planes in the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "the ground state is anti - ferromagnetic with mn@xmath1 valence in the cubic structure .",
    "this result shows that the jahn - teller distortion is not a necessary prerequisite for an insulating ground state .",
    "rather the valence of the mn ion and the magnetic structure determine the insulating properties .",
    "furthermore , the experimentally observed af - a magnetic order is obtained in the cubic structure , indicating that the jahn - teller distortion does not influence the magnetic structure .",
    "further inspection of fig .",
    "[ energyvsvol ] also reveals that the energy scale associated with the magnetic structure is smaller than the one associated with the charge . in the vicinity of the energy minimum",
    "we find that the least unfavourable configuration is trivalent ( mn@xmath1 ) in the ferromagnetic state , whilst the most unfavourable is tetravalent ( mn@xmath3 ) in the ferromagnetic structure .",
    "the theoretical volume is in very good agreement with experiment : 238 @xmath27 versus an experimental value of 244 @xmath27 .    reducing the volume",
    ", we obtain between 200 @xmath27 and 215 @xmath27 a charge disproportionated mn@xmath1/mn@xmath3 state , in the ferromagnetic structure , as the state with the lowest energy .",
    "this state consists of an anti - ferro ordering of the mno@xmath2 planes along the z - direction according to mn@xmath1o@xmath2/mn@xmath3o@xmath2 .",
    "such a state is also observed in sr doped lamno@xmath0 . in the calculations of banach and temmerman@xcite this state",
    "was obtained by sr doping whilst keeping the volume constant .",
    "the present results demonstrate that the volume reduction is another factor inducing the charge disproportionated state whilst jahn - teller distortions , globally or locally , are not necessary .",
    "however , this charge order can drive a structural distortion which is still present in lamno@xmath0 under pressure.@xcite note that we have only studied the simplest of the charge ordered states and that a more complex ordering might give rise to a further lowering of the energy .",
    "obviously this could be modelled by larger supercells which was not examined in this work .",
    "consideration of the jahn - teller distortion in this volume range would probably introduce the possibility of orbital order , which would be interesting to study as a function of pressure .",
    "the occurence of a charge disproportionated mn@xmath1/mn@xmath3 region as a function of pressure could lead to local jahn - teller distortions and the disappearance of the jahn - teller distortion as a function of pressure might therefore not happen uniformly .",
    "when the ferromagnetic charge disproportionated state is entered the system becomes metallic .",
    "the polarisation is around 70% in this charge disproportionated state .",
    "this state persists through the next phase transition into the tetravalent mn@xmath3 at a volume of 200 @xmath27 .",
    "the charge disproportionation at the surface might be different from the bulk .",
    "calculations were performed to model a lamno@xmath0 surface by considering a supercell consisting of four lamno@xmath0 formula units and two `` empty lamno@xmath0 '' formula units .",
    "the lamno@xmath0 surface can either be terminated with lao or mno@xmath2 planes . both were calculated and for a mno@xmath2 surface the delocalisation of the e@xmath10 electron took place .",
    "this is surprising since one would expect on intuitive grounds , due to band narrowing , a localisation at the surface to be preferable .",
    "this is the case for example in @xmath28-ce where the surface consists of @xmath29-ce.@xcite that a delocalisation at the surface took place is also reflected in a reduction of the mn surface magnetic moment by 6% .",
    "the reason might be that the e@xmath10 electron localised in the bulk is of @xmath30 symmetry character and this orbital points perpendicular to the surface into the vacuum .",
    "therefore it has less electrons to capture for localisation .",
    "changing the surface termination to lao does not alter the valence on the mn in the mno@xmath2 sub - surface , however it does change the symmetry of the localised state from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "we have calculated the electronic total energy of lamno@xmath0 , in the cubic structure , as a function of volume and for different magnetic and charge ordered states .",
    "we find that the jahn - teller distortion is not crucial to explain the insulating anti - ferromagnetic ground state of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "a smooth localization - delocalization transition is observed since the transition from mn@xmath1 to mn@xmath3 goes through the intermediary of a mixture of mn@xmath1/mn@xmath3 .",
    "an accurate p - v curve could be modelled via cpa ( coherent - potential - approximation ) calculations where at each volume the total energy is minimized with respect to the concentration of mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath3.@xcite +",
