    "conjugated polymers have become one of the prominent candidates in flexible , solid state organic light emitting diode ( oled ) devices @xcite .",
    "they are now employed in commercial displays and lighting applications .",
    "emission properties in these devices are primarily based on injection of an electron and hole from electrodes into the device .",
    "these charges migrate under the influence of the electric field and could finally recombine , giving rise to a singlet or a triplet exciton on the conjugated system .",
    "although simple spin statistics predicts generation of at most @xmath5 singlet excitons due to independent injection of electron and hole , this is not borne out experimentally .",
    "the spin statistics does not account for the rate of formation of the excitons , and the rate depends upon the binding energies of excitons .",
    "the singlet exciton binding energy being smaller than that of the triplet exciton , more singlets are formed in a unit time than triplets .",
    "the exciton binding is purely a consequence of electron - electron interactions and the @xmath5 upper bound for singlet exciton formation is valid only in the noninteracting picture @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this , the actual yield of singlets is still small and low internal efficiency of electroluminescence in oleds beckons alternate routes such as harnessing triplet excited states .",
    "inclusion of heavy metal atoms like platinum ( pt ) or iridium ( ir ) in the conjugated polymer enhances spin - orbit coupling which breaks the spin symmetry , thus allowing what is notionally a singlet - triplet transition , indeed electrophosphorescent devices have been developed @xcite using this principle .",
    "however , the longer lifetime of phosphorescence results in saturation of triplet state population of the emitter and promotes triplet - triplet annihilation ( tta ) .",
    "tta could give rise to a lower energy nonemissive state which will not contribute to light emission @xcite .",
    "hence , the alternate pathway i.e. population enhancement via conversion of triplet states into singlet states seems to be a promising option for harnessing triplets to enhance electroluminescence quantum yield .",
    "the position of triplet @xmath3 relative to the singlet @xmath2 is also of importance in other applications such as photodynamic therapy , where collision between triplet oxygen and @xmath2 will give rise to @xmath3 and singlet oxygen , the latter being the reactive species in the therapy .    in organic systems",
    "@xmath6 population transfer can be achieved either through triplet - triplet annihilation or through reverse intersystem crossing ( risc ) .",
    "triplet - triplet annihilation can theoretically maximize yield up to @xmath7 based on the simplistic argument that two spin-1 species can give rise to one spin two , one spin one and one spin zero species , resulting in a theoretical maximum yield of @xmath8 .",
    "this picture will change in interacting models depending upon the exciton binding energy of the species .",
    "however , there are claims that tta can enhance oled efficiency up to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the excited singlet population can also be enhanced by the risc mechanism .",
    "although @xmath10 by kasha rule , normally @xmath11 is far less than @xmath12 and triplets are lost .",
    "the risc idea is to find systems in which the @xmath13 gap is of order @xmath14 under ordinary conditions .",
    "thermal equilibrium may then repopulate @xmath2 and depending upon competing processes , make fluorescence the dominant decay mode for @xmath3 as well .",
    "even better would be violation of kasha rule , molecules with @xmath15 .",
    "thus reduction of energy gap between singlet excited state and triplet excited state and utilization of environmental thermal energy for risc appears to be an attractive alternate path for enhancing the efficiency of electroluminescent devices .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations of risc are being carried out through the last decade , both in metal - containing and all - organic ( metal - free ) conjugated molecules and oligomers .",
    "kohler et al . studied @xmath13 gap using fluorescence and delayed - fluorescence techniques in platinum containing phenylene ethylene polymers with spacers of different size and in their all - organic analogs ; corresponding energy gaps are of the order @xmath16 ev irrespective of the organic ligand used @xcite . in spite of this success , interest in metal containing polymers",
    "has waned since the metals in these systems are usually rare - earth .",
    "metal - free thiophenylene based copolymers with ( i ) para - phenylene , ( ii ) ethylene , ( iii ) phenylene vinylene and ( iv ) thioenylene vinylene moieties in their structure are synthesized by chaudhuri et al . @xcite .",
    "the lowest achievable @xmath13 gap reported is as small as 0.02 ev , as determined by the difference in the peak position of the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra @xcite .",
    "endo et al . developed molecular luminophores where minimal spatial overlap of frontier molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) , residing on donor and acceptor moieties results in a gap of 0.11 ev @xcite , while uoyama and coworkers @xcite have reported better molecular system with lower than @xmath17 mev gap . in both reports",
    ", it is proposed that , introduction of steric hindrance results in very low spatial overlap between homo and lumo of the corresponding molecules and consequently reduced gap between the excited states .",
    "this assumes that the energy difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is governed by the exchange integral involving the homo and lumo orbitals , which to a first approximation is governed by the differential overlap of the homo and lumo orbitals .",
    "goushi et al .",
    "developed electroluminescent devices based on exciplex formation between donor and acceptor molecules , corresponding energy separation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in these systems being @xmath18 mev @xcite .",
    "recently , adachi et al . synthesized molecules belonging to carbazole - triazine family with smaller @xmath13 gaps ( @xmath19 ev ) @xcite and they have come up with some systems having comaparable gaps @xcite , in the amine - sulphone family .",
    "theoretical modelling of excited singlet - triplet gap in molecular systems having a donor and acceptor moieties is done in configuration interaction picture with only single particle - hole excitations .",
    "gierschner et al . investigated carbazole - paraterphenyl systems with different substituents on donor and acceptor parts and with different linkers between parent moities using time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) technique @xcite . however",
    ", td - dft still suffers from lack of accurate functionals for the calculations .",
    "kohler et al . studied @xmath13 gap in planar and twisted conformations of long @xmath20conjugated oligomers of poly(p - phenylene vinylene ) ( ppv ) , poly(p - phenylene ) ( ppp ) and poly(p - phenylene ethynylene ) ( ppe ) @xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed in single ci space within the intermediate neglect of differential overlap ( indo ) model .",
    "they found that the energy gap between singlet excited state @xmath1 and triplet state @xmath0 is independent of structure and consistent with the value of @xmath21 ev , as they argued that the exchange interaction is short ranged in character , depends only on the electron - hole wavefunction overlap and therefore will be invariant in longer chains .",
    "the twist of each monomer about its neighboring monomer also does not affect much as twist in general remains in the range of @xmath22 .",
    "their calculation are based on the crude single ci approximation whose validity is in question in the twisted conformation .",
    "there is also work of karsten et al . who have reported oligomers of 5,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine where the @xmath13 gap reduces from @xmath23 ev to @xmath24 ev in the pentamers .",
    "the theoretical calculation at the indo level , predicts the gap to be of the order of @xmath25 ev in the pentamers @xcite . although , a number of materials with low singlet - triplet gaps are studied , most of them are molecular or oligomeric systems .",
    "organic electronic devices use both small molecules and large oligomers . both have their own advantages and disadvantages . processing of large oligomers",
    "is an advantage but variation in oligomer structure from batch to batch is a disadvantage . on the other hand , molecules have well - defined structure but their processing is not as simple as those of oligomers and they also tend to crystallize , degrading the device performance . in the case of small molecules",
    "intermolecular charge separation or exciplex formation is necessary for obtaining smaller gap systems and this is possible only on introducing very strong donors and acceptors .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to explore various factors such as the strength of electron correlations , role of donor and acceptor substitutions , length of @xmath26-conjugation and the geometry of the conjugated back - bone on the @xmath13 gap in simple substituted and unsubstituted polyenes . attributing the @xmath13 gap to the strength of the exchange integral involving homo and lumo orbitals is equivalent to single ci approximation , which is grossly inadequate in strongly correlated systems such as the conjugated @xmath26-systems .",
    "instead , in our approach we carry out full ci calculation on model polyenes to explore the relative importance of different factors that control the @xmath13 gap .",
    "while unsubstituted polyenes in the polymer limit do not fluoresce strongly , substituted polyenes in principle show strong fluorescence , hence we have used substituted polyenes as model compounds in the study .",
    "we have employed the pariser - parr - pople model to study the @xmath13 gap .",
    "we have also employed the hubbard model study to verify the accuracy of our extrapolations . in the ppp model ,",
    "the ground state @xmath27 of an unsubstituted polyene consists of predominantly singly occupied @xmath28 orbitals , while the singlet @xmath2 state , if it is dipole allowed , has more contribution from a pair of doubly occupied and empty @xmath28 orbitals . if @xmath2 is a two - photon state , as is the case of long polyenes , it has more probability for singly occupied states than even the ground state .",
    "the triplet @xmath3 state is much like the @xmath27 state , except that the electron delocalisation is reduced due to pauli blocking for electron transfer between neighboring orbitals having the same spin . in this study , we explore ways of increasing ionicity of the @xmath3 state to raise its energy close to that of the @xmath2 state , when @xmath2 is dipole allowed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian and the methodology of our study . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the role of ( i ) conjugation length , ( ii ) dimerisation strength , ( iii ) donor - acceptor strength in push - pull systems , and ( iv ) the role of molecular geometry on the s1  t1 gap , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize and conclude our study .",
    "in the present model system calculation , we consider linear even polyene chains of length varying between @xmath29 sites in steps of @xmath30 carbon sites , so as to have even number of electrons in the @xmath26 system . in substituted polyenes , three type of substitutions",
    "are considered ; in one , the donor and acceptor effects are introduced alternately along all carbon atoms in the chain , while in the second we have considered the donor and acceptor substitutions at the terminal carbon atoms and have rotated the molecule about the middle bond , in @xmath31 ( n integer ) polyene chain . in the third , we have substituted one half of the @xmath32 site polyene chain by donors and the other half by acceptors . the basic idea , behind considering alternate donor - acceptor substitutions is to reduce the effect of strong electron - electron interaction , for it is known that in non - correlated picture the lowest singlet excited state @xmath2 and lowest triplet excited state @xmath3 are degenerate . in fig .",
    "[ system ] , we have schematically shown a polyene system with donor - acceptor substitution at alternate sites .",

    "the ppp hamiltonian being non - relativistic , conserves total spin .",
    "since we are interested in the singlet and triplet states , it is best to solve for the eigenvalues in a spin adapted basis .",
    "this has the twin advantage of dealing with smaller hilbert space as well as labelling the eigenstates by the total spin .",
