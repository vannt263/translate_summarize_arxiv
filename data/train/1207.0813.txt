    "recent progress on the observational search of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with peculiar features led to the discovery of a sizable number of active black hole ( bh ) pairs in galaxies undergoing a merger , dubbed dual agn .",
    "these pairs are observed when the two galaxies are in the early stage of a merger , at separations in excess of several kpc ( e.g. comerford et al .",
    "2009 , green et al .",
    "2010 , liu et al .",
    "2010 , fu et al .",
    "2011 , shields et al .",
    "the dual bhs are expected to evolve into a close pair , as they sink in the gravitational potential of the new galaxy . at about a few parsec the bhs form a keplerian binary , and",
    "this occurs when their mass exceeds the mass of stars and gas enclosed in their orbit ( colpi & dotti 2011 for a review ) .",
    "this phase and the phase of subsequent hardening due to the interaction of the stellar / gaseous background is still difficult to observe . at such close separations the binary ( if both bhs are active ) would not be identified as a dual source due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "the discovery of bona fide bh binaries ( bhbs hereon ) is important as it represents a fundamental test for current models of galaxy formation : bhbs are signposts of galactic mergers and thus of the cosmic assembly of substructures . nonetheless , convincing observational evidence of close bhbs in galactic nuclei is still missing with few exceptions .",
    "two compact double radio nuclei are observed in the core of the galaxy 0402 + 379 on scales of @xmath6 pc ( rodriguez et al .",
    "2006 ) , and signatures of a keplerian motion of a sub - pc bh binary have been claimed in oj287 ( valtonen et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "spectroscopic search of bhbs is a promising technique for the search of such elusive sources .",
    "the bhs in a close binary revolve around the common center of mass with a velocity that can highly exceed the velocity of gas and stars far out in the gravitational potential of the background galaxy , and this may generate a velocity off - set among atomic emission lines .",
    "taking advantage of the wealth of spectroscopic data made publicly available thanks to the sloan sky digital survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) , different groups developed systematic strategies focussed on the selection of agn spectra displaying multiple sets of narrow and broad emission lines ( bels ) with relative doppler - shifts @xmath7 ( e.g. tsalmantza et al . 2011 , eracleous et al .",
    "2011 , tsalmantza & hogg 2012 ) .",
    "substantial velocity off - sets between the two set of emission lines , respectively associated with the host galaxy reference frame and the gas bound to the single bh , potentially mark the orbital motion of the active member of the binary system in the galactic nucleus .",
    "follow - up campaigns revealing periodic changes in the observed doppler - shifted lines are necessary in order to firmly favor the binary hypothesis against other possible physical scenarios such as : a recoiling bh resulting from a bhb coalescence , a double - peaked emitter or a chance superposition along the line of sight . considering that the orbital period of a sub - pc bhb can be as long as a few @xmath8 yr , the spectral monitoring of these sources is rather long .",
    "a further disadvantage of this direct doppler - shift technique is that the spectroscopic search is limited to a redshift of @xmath9 as at higher redshifts all the most important narrow emission lines fall out of the optical range covered by the survey .    in montuori",
    "et al . ( 2011 ; hereafter paper i ) , we devised a tool for exploring potential spectral signatures of sub - pc bhbs at redshift @xmath10 , where bhbs should be frequent according to the present hierarchical cosmological model .",
    "the explored scenario was that of a binary , surrounded by a circum - binary disc , that after clearing a gap , i.e. a low density hollow region in the midst of the disc , has confined its activity around the secondary bh fed by material inflowing from the inner edge of the disc ( e.g. artymovicz & lubow 1994 , ivanov et al .",
    "1999 , hayasaki et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , cuadra et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we assumed that a small - scale accretion disc is maintained around the secondary bh throughout the binary orbital decay induced by the external torques from the circum - binary disc or by the emission of gravitational waves ( e.g. haiman , kocsis & menou 2009 ) . in paper",
    "i we noticed that under these conditions broad emission line clouds orbiting around the active bh suffer erosion inside the gap due to the tidal truncation at the roche lobe surface , resulting in a sizable reduction of the flux ratio between lines of low and high ionization potentials relative to the typical values observed for isolated agn . in particular it was found that sub - parsec bhbs could be potentially identified in the archives of current automatic surveys selecting agn spectra characterized by a flux ratio between the mgii and the civ lines ( @xmath11 ) below @xmath12 .    in paper",
    "i , the contribution to the different bels from illuminated gas not bound to the secondary , active bh was neglected . in this paper , we improve upon our earlier investigation by studying the contribution to the bels resulting from reprocessing of bh radiation by the gas of the circum - binary disc and by gas streams in the gap region flowing toward the bhb .",
    "in particular we explore when and how the ratio @xmath11 varies in response to changes in the spatial distribution of the broad line emitting gas as the binary hardens .",
    "section [ sec : qualitative ] and [ sec : quantitative ] describe how we extend our previous result , guided by a qualitative analysis , and later by a more quantitative study .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of this analysis , carried out with data taken from sph numerical simulations .",
    "discussion and conclusions are reported in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in order to overcome some of the simplifying assumptions made in our exploratory paper i , we consider here the potentially observable contribution from gas in the circum - binary disc surrounding the bhb . we start with a schematic view of the spatial scales relevant to our binary evolutionary model .",
    "two characteristic radii are present : the roche lobe radius @xmath13 around the secondary , only active bh and the inner edge of the circum - binary disc @xmath14 . the roche radius @xmath15 $ ] ( eggleton 1983 ) and @xmath16 ( e.g. artymovicz & lubow 1994 ) are plotted in figure [ fig : radii ] as function of the binary orbital separation @xmath17 , for a circular bhb with mass ratio @xmath18 and mass of the secondary @xmath19 .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the gap region between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while the horizontal lines correspond to the values of @xmath20 calculated from the following radius - luminosity relations for the civ ( @xmath21 , in blue , kaspi et al . 2007 ) and the mgii ( @xmath22 , in red , mclure & jarvis 2002 ) : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the continuum luminosities at 1350@xmath27 and 3000@xmath27 .",
    "we consider the case of a secondary bh shining with a constant eddington ratio set to @xmath28 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines mark the orbital separations corresponding to different values of @xmath29 ( 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 as indicated in the figure ) for the lines emitted by the gas of the blr located inside @xmath13 .",
    "these orbital separations are computed as described in paper i. in particular , the emission from the blr around the secondary bh is modelled according to the loc model ( e.g. baldwin et al . 1995 ) , adopting a power - law with index set to -1 for the clouds radial distance from the active source , and a uniform distribution for the clouds density at each radius . the hydrogen number density is set in the range",
    "@xmath30 so that at @xmath31 pc , our starting point where @xmath13 coincides with @xmath32 , @xmath29 is consistent with the typical values observed for standard agn , i.e. @xmath33 ( see figure 4 of paper i ) . moving toward smaller bhb separations , we highlight the occurrence of intervals possibly characterized by different observational signatures . as the binary separation shrinks , @xmath34 becomes smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "according to our previous results , this implies a reduction in the ratio @xmath29 for the bels associated with the blr of the secondary bh .",
    "we consider the results of paper i to be valid until the flux ratio drops to a value @xmath36 at an orbital separation of @xmath37 pc , corresponding to a period of @xmath38 yr , for the selected binary parameters .",
    "the contribution coming from the material not bound to the secondary active bh can be still neglected at these separations considering that : ( i ) the gas density in the gap region is expected to be much lower than the density relative to standard blrs , and the bels are efficiently reprocessed only at high densities ; and that ( ii ) the inner edge of the circum - binary disc @xmath14 is located at a distance @xmath39 so that the ionizing flux reaching the higher density material associated with the outer circum - binary disc would be more than an order of magnitude lower relative to the flux intercepted by the gas bound to the active source .    as the semimajor axis shortens further on ,",
    "this spectroscopic signature is not expected to be a good tracer of the presence of a sub - pc bhb , since the additional contribution of the circum - binary disc can not be any longer neglected , yielding an increase in @xmath29 . at intermediate separations of the order of @xmath40 pc , where @xmath41 , @xmath29 could be even higher than what typically observed for isolated agn since the circum - binary disc could start to contribute significantly to the mgii line while the civ emission flux could be still reduced relative to the case of a single agn since @xmath42 . at the smallest orbital separations , of the order of @xmath43 pc , where @xmath44",
    ", the higher density gas of the circum - binary disc could efficiently reprocess both the civ and the mgii emission lines bringing @xmath29 back to the values observed for standard blrs .",
    "in section [ sec : qualitative ] we qualitatively showed that the flux ratio of the mgii and cvi emission lines varies with bhb separation , and that this change may not be monotonic with decreasing @xmath45 due to the contribution to the line flux from dense gas present in the circum - binary disc , depending on the relative position of the two critical radii @xmath46 and @xmath35 with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath13 .    to proceed more quantitatively in our analysis",
    ", we model the spectroscopic signatures of a close bhb applying here a simple line radiative transfer algorithm on data extracted from a simulated model of a circum - binary gas disc .",
    "the model self - consistently accounts for the presence of a low ( but finite ) density region , i.e. the gap , and of gas streams that leaking out through the inner edge of the disc are accreted by the binary .",
    "in particular we consider the numerical results presented in sesana et al .",
    "( 2012 , s12 hereafter ) who used a modified version of the sph code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 , cuadra et al . 2009 ) to model the complex feeding process of a bhb embedded in a coplanar , co - rotating circum - binary accretion disc .",
    "the orbital separation in the simulation , @xmath47 pc , is in the interval appropriate to test our working hypothesis , namely that the line fluxes from mgii and cvi can have a contribution from dense gas in the circum - binary disc . at the considered orbital separation ,",
    "the simulated binary system is still dynamically coupled with the circum - binary disc , while its orbital decay is dominated by the emission of gravitational waves ( see s12 and references therein ) .",
    "we map the gas density field on a cubic , three dimensional coarse grid , and in the following we will refer to the cubic grid elements as pixels .",
    "pixels are then exposed to the ionizing radiation originating from gas accreting in the putative small - scale disc around the secondary bh .",
    "the small - scale accretion disc is assumed to be coplanar with the binary , and the ionizing emission is modeled adopting a cosine - like dilution along the disc axis to mimic thermal emission from an optically thick ( geometrically thin ) accretion flow ( e.g. ivanov et al 1999 , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in the sph simulation at hand the gas accretion rate onto the bh",
    "is given by summing over all particles crossing the bh sink radius in a time - step .",
    "in our analysis , we select simulation snapshots corresponding to the secondary bh radiating with a luminosity of 0.1 the eddington luminosity ( assuming 10% radiative efficiency ) . then , for all simulation pixels , the gas ionization state is computed using the code cloudy ( version 08.00 ; ferland et al .",
    "we adopt the agn sed template stored in the code , scaled to the appropriate level given by the coordinates of the considered pixel .",
    "the ionization state of the gas is determined moving from the innermost pixels to the outer region along straight ray paths . to trace the cumulative effect of radiation absorption along a ray path",
    ", we make a net distinction between pixels which are optically thick and optically thin to the hi ionizing continuum .",
    "we assume that a pixel is not reached by ionizing radiation if at least one optically thick pixel is met along a ray .",
    "our treatment is clearly a simplified description of the real radiative transfer , as we assume complete ( zero ) absorption for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "however this procedure greatly facilitates the analysis process , and at the same time captures the basic feature of sharp ionization fronts expected in the circum - binary gas .",
    "the next step is to model the bels . a self - consistent model for the blr is still lacking as it is poorly constrained by the observations .",
    "despite these limitations , the origin of the bels is generally attributed to compact , dense condensations rapidly moving in a hotter intercloud medium ( e.g. osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "though the density of such unresolved clouds ( estimated to be @xmath50 ) is well above the maximum density given by our sph simulation , we can use the gas distribution determined in the sph simulation as a physically motivated `` background '' density field to model the spatial distribution of the bel clouds . to this aim , we select the densest ( @xmath51 ) ionized regions of the circum - binary disc and of the streams flowing from its inner - edge , and there we superimpose a distribution of gas overdensities mimicking the bel clouds .",
    "operatively , we add a gaseous clump in all illuminated pixels whose hydrogen number density is above a given threshold .",
    "such limiting value is set so that the total number of pixels embedding bel clumps do not exceed the @xmath52 of the total number of ionized pixels .",
    "the density of each bel clump is set randomly from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath53 .",
    "we further assume that the clumps filling factor is @xmath54 , so that the cumulative shielding effect along ray paths can be neglected .",
    "as discussed in the following section , we manage to check the consistency of our expectations discussed in section [ sec : qualitative ] without any other constraint on the distribution of such bel clumps .",
    "once bel clumps are added , we use again cloudy to compute their line emission properties . as a final remark , we caution that we do not model the emission coming from the gas orbiting inside the roche lobe of the secondary .",
    "the numerical resolution is not high enough to describe the properties of the material located at radii @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the main interest of our work here is to compute the broad line emission from the material not bound to the active bh but rather bound to the binary , in order to test our qualitative expectations .",
    "in this section we describe the results from a simulation of a close bhb with @xmath47 pc , a secondary bh with mass @xmath56 and mass ratio @xmath57 , surrounded by a coplanar , co - rotating circum - binary disc with a gap .",
    "in particular , we consider a snapshot where the secondary active bh accretes with @xmath58 ( we adopt a radiative efficiency of 0.1 ) . as discussed in section [ sec : qualitative ] , the binary model implies that @xmath59 .",
    "therefore we expect that the gas in the circum - binary disc would give an important contribution to the bels .    in figure",
    "[ fig : contour ] we show our results superimposing the intensity contour plot of the mgii and the civ lines on the density map of the selected snapshot .",
    "as described in the previous section , the bels clouds are distributed on top of the cubic grid adding a gaseous clump to those illuminated pixels whose hydrogen number density is @xmath60 .",
    "these pixels are located in the gap region and in a thin layer above the circum - binary disc midplane , within a radius @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath63 internal unit lengths of the simulation ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : contour ] , the emission line intensity maps follow the spatial distribution of the gaseous clumps .",
    "we obtain @xmath64 for the emission coming from the gaseous over - densities . the relative contribution to the civ and the mgii lines coming from the gap region",
    "is of the order of @xmath65 and @xmath66    in order to verify that our results are not affected by the details of the post - process procedure , we perform a second analysis starting from the same snapshot but considering an isotropic ionizing source .",
    "although the number of illuminated pixels is @xmath67 larger in this case , the results are consistent with the previous analysis .",
    "the emission coming from the gap region increases since the ionizing flux is not zero in the direction perpendicular to the polar axis . in this case",
    "we have @xmath68 and the relative contribution to the civ and mgii lines from the gaseous clumps in the central cavity is of the order of @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "we point out that the simplified procedure adopted for the distribution of the over - densities does not take into account that the formation of the gaseous clumps might be disfavored in the gap region , characterized by lower densities and higher temperatures . for this reason",
    "@xmath29 could be higher than what computed with our analysis since we might be overestimating the contribution to the civ line coming from the clumps closer to the ionizing source .    according to section [ sec : qualitative ]",
    ", we expect to select bhb candidates with a peculiarly reduced value of @xmath29 when the circum - binary disc is still too far from the active source and does not give a significant contribution to the bels .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : radii ] , @xmath29 computed for the blr around the secondary bh is reduced to a value of @xmath71 at an orbital distance of the order of @xmath37 pc , while the inner edge of the circum - binary disc @xmath14 is located far out at radii @xmath72 . in order to quantitatively check such predictions",
    "we perform an additional test using the same snapshot and rescaling the unit length by a factor of 4 so that the orbital separation of the simulated binary system is @xmath37 pc .",
    "according to eq .",
    "14 of s12 , the rescaling keeps a disc - to - binary mass ratio of a few percent , still consistent with the value of @xmath73 assumed in the simulation for @xmath74 pc .",
    "now we can compare the emission fluxes obtained with the distribution of gaseous clumps considered for the @xmath74 pc case with the emission fluxes computed for an equal number of clumps ( with the same total mass and densities ) superimposed on the snapshot rescaled at @xmath37 pc .",
    "in particular , the gaseous clumps are added to the rescaled snapshot pixels that are ionized by the active source and whose number density is @xmath75 .    with this procedure",
    "we find that the contribution to the civ and the mgii fluxes from the circum - binary disc , at a binary separation of @xmath37 pc , is reduced relative to the case with @xmath74 pc by a factor of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with our expectations considering that on average the ionizing flux reaching the high density clumps is in this case reduced of an order of magnitude . according to the model assumed for the cloud distribution in the blr of the secondary bh , at the considered orbital separation the bels flux reduction , relative to the fluxes computed at @xmath78 , is of the order of @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the civ and the mgii line , respectively . according to our results",
    ", the contribution from the outer disc to the civ line can be neglected while that to the mgii line corresponds to an increase of @xmath81 . even considering this external emission , we obtain @xmath82 that is still reduced relative to its typical values for single agn .",
    "this is consistent with our bhb selection criterion , as discussed in paper i , of @xmath83 considering both the uncertainties in the calculations and in the blr model .",
    "figure  [ fig : results ] shows , as function of the mass of the secondary active bh , the minimum and maximum values of the orbital period @xmath84 ( upper panel ) and of the orbital velocity @xmath85 ( lower panel ) of the active bh relative to the binary center of mass , within which we expect to select a bhb system from its peculiarly reduced value of @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding bhb separations can be inferred given the relation @xmath87 pc for a binary mass ratio of 0.3 .",
    "relying on the results discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the limiting values for @xmath84 and @xmath85 are obtained requiring that : ( i ) @xmath88 , so that the circum - binary disc contributes to the mgii line at most by @xmath52 relative to the typical bel flux of a single agn ; ( ii ) @xmath89 even considering the additional contribution from the gas not bound to the active bh .",
    "we set the upper limit for @xmath29 to @xmath90 on the basis of the observed distribution inferred from @xmath91 6000 quasar spectra in the sdss archive ( @xmath92 of the sources has a @xmath93 , see figure 4 of paper i ) .",
    "maximum periods ( minimum velocities ) depend on the way we model the blr around the active bh . in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : results ] describing the run of @xmath84 with @xmath94",
    ", the lower solid line refers to the blr model considered in the previous sections , i.e. a uniform density distribution and a power - law with index -1 for the radial distances distribution ( hereon model a ) .",
    "the upper solid line corresponds to the case of a power - law with index -0.5 for the radial distribution while the densities are set uniformly in the range @xmath95 ( hereon model b ) . in the lower panel for @xmath85",
    "the upper and lower solid lines refer to model a and model b , respectively . for model b ( which has a flatter radial distribution and a lower upper limit for the density range relative to model a )",
    "the emission coming from the outer part of the blr is more relevant and @xmath29 can be significantly reduced also at higher orbital separations . however in model",
    "b we notice that @xmath29 computed at the starting orbital separation , corresponding to @xmath96 , is lower of a factor of @xmath97 0.8 because of the lower density assumed for the blr clouds .",
    "therefore we consider the maximum orbital values computed with model b as upper limits .",
    "moreover for blr clouds distributed uniformly in both radius and density , the effect of the flux ratio reduction would be even stronger than the models considered in the figure .",
    "on the other hand the bel fluxes would be so diminished as the orbital separation shrinks that the contribution from the external gas would be more effective in increasing @xmath29 to its standard values . in this case",
    "there would be a narrower range of orbital parameters suitable to observe a peculiar @xmath29 because of the presence of a close bhb .",
    "solid and dashed lines in figure [ fig : results ] scale as @xmath98 .",
    "the scaling can be simply understood considering that the maximum and minimum orbital separations ( thus the maximum and minimum @xmath84 ) correspond to a fixed ratio @xmath99 .",
    "this means that @xmath100 ( see the @xmath20-luminosity relations reported in section [ sec : qualitative ] ) , where the subscript @xmath101 refers to the maximum / minimum value of the parameter . since @xmath102",
    ", we obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104 as noticed before , we are working under the assumption of a circular binary orbit so that there is a fixed relation between the roche radius of the secondary bh and the binary semi - major axis .",
    "a number of numerical studies showed that the interaction with a circum - binary disc can bring the eccentricity of a binary system up to a constant saturation value which is fairly high , i.e. @xmath105 ( e.g. cuadra et al .",
    "2009 , roedig 2011 ) .",
    "the roche lobe radius is ill - defined for an eccentric binary .",
    "on an eccentric orbit with @xmath106 , the active , secondary bh has an apocenter ( pericenter ) @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) times larger ( smaller ) than a circular orbit . under these circumstances ,",
    "the blr of the secondary bh may have no time to re - expand after the truncation at the pericentric passage due to the characteristics of the periodic inflows of material onto the bhs .",
    "the analysis presented in section [ sec : results ] for the @xmath47 pc case would not be significantly affected by the precise value of the roche lobe of the secondary bh .",
    "indeed , @xmath109 in both cases so that the circum - binary disc would still give the major contribution to the bels .",
    "results are different when most of the emission comes from the material bound to the secondary bh , as in the @xmath110 pc case . in this case",
    ", if the blr of the secondary bh does not expand after the pericentric passage , @xmath29 would be that computed for a binary with a semimajor axis reduced by a factor @xmath111 .",
    "then , it could be possible to select binary candidates with longer orbital periods compared to the circular case .",
    "if instead the blr expands to fill @xmath13 at the apocentre the flux ratio reduction would be less significative .",
    "the chance to select a binary candidate before the circum - binary disc starts to contribute to the bels would be lower , and more affected by the details of the blr model .",
    "in this work we pursue our investigation of new possible observable signatures associated with close massive bhbs interacting with a circum - binary disc . in paper",
    "i , we proposed a technique based on the observation of a peculiarly reduced value of the flux ratio between two prominent bels characterized by different ionization potentials , i.e. the civ and the mgii lines .    in this second work we addressed the robustness of the proposed criterion when the presence of the material surrounding the bhb is considered . in particular , we aimed at quantifying the effect on @xmath11 of the circum - binary disc and the low density gas in the gap .",
    "as in paper i , we assumed a circular bhb with the secondary being the only active bh .",
    "we presented a qualitative estimate of the relative importance of the external contributions to the bel fluxes at different orbital separations .",
    "we then tested our results with the post - process analysis of a sph simulation of a bhb embedded in a circum - binary disc .",
    "the main result of our analysis can be summarized stating that we expect to select close massive bhbs because of a peculiarly reduced value of @xmath11 for a limited range of sub - pc orbital separations . in this range",
    "the main contribution to the bels comes from the tidally perturbed blr bound to the secondary active bh .",
    "we notice that , although orbiting at very close separations , the bhbs characterized by a low @xmath112 are expected to be in the long - lived disc - driven phase of the binary orbital migration ( e.g. haiman , kocsis & menou 2009 ) . at even closer separations , where the binary lifetimes are shorter due to the emission of gravitational waves , the line flux from the blr of the secondary keeps on reducing , while the gas associated with the circum - binary disc starts to give a significant contribution to the bels .",
    "this has two main consequences : ( i ) @xmath11 rises up into the typical observed range for agn , and ( ii ) the wavelengths of the bel peaks are not expected to be related to the orbital motion of the active bh , in agreement with shen & loeb ( 2010 ) for a different blr geometry .",
