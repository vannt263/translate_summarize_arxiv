    "we study the beam energy , system size and collision centrality dependencies quantitatively in order to identify possible signature of the formation of a qgp .",
    "the data used in this analysis were measured using the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector during the 2001 , 2002 , 2004 and 2005 data rhic runs at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the @xmath13 collisions at @xmath8 62.4 , 130 , and 200 gev data and @xmath2 collisions at @xmath8 62.4 and 200 gev were acquired with minimum bias triggers . for 19.6 gev data ,",

    "the dynamical net charge fluctuations , in general , exhibit a monotonic dependence on the number of participating nucleons . at a given number of participants the measured fluctuations also exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy , with @xmath9 magnitude being the largest in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1  19.6  gev .",

    "the magnitude of the normalized correlation is maximum for the smallest pseudorapidity ranges and decreases monotonically to unity , at all energies and centralities , with increasing pseudorapidity range .",

    "net charge dynamical fluctuations violate the trivial @xmath6 scaling expected for nuclear collisions consisting of independent nucleon - nucleon interactions . scaled dynamical net charge fluctuations @xmath20 grow by up to 40% from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "this centrality dependence may arise , in part due to the large radial collective flow produced in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we also studied fluctuations as a function of azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity and found that dynamical fluctuations exhibit a strong dependence on rapidity and azimuthal angular ranges which could be attributed in part to radial flow effects .",
