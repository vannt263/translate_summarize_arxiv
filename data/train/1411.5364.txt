    "after the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite , we can finally analyze a particle that seems directly related to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism .",
    "thus , almost fifty years since the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson was postulated  @xcite , the study of the discovered particle properties can be used for the first time as a way to access the mechanism responsible for the ewsb . in particular ,",
    "in the present note we focus on the analysis of the higgs interactions to the rest of sm particles .",
    "a huge variety of data has already been collected , not only from higgs searches at both tevatron and the lhc , but also from the measurements of triple gauge boson vertices ( tgv ) s at the colliders and from the low energy electroweak precision measurements . in this context",
    "we present a framework suitable to study the nature of the observed state via the analysis of its couplings , exploiting all the existing data sets . pursuing a model independent analysis of the higgs interactions ,",
    "the effective lagrangian approach  @xcite is arguably one of the most motivated frameworks from the theoretical point of view , given the lack of observation of any other new resonance .",
    "hence , the effective lagrangian is useful as a model independent way to parametrize the low energy deviations in the higgs interactions caused by new physics ( np ) . following this motivation we present on the first part of this note the effective lagrangian expansion based on the assumption that the observed state is introduced as a doublet of @xmath1 , where then the @xmath2 symmetry is linearly realized in the effective theory which describes the indirect np effects at lhc energies  @xcite . after presenting the results from a global analysis to the different ewsb related data sets  @xcite , we focus on the very interesting complementarity between higgs analyses and tgv measurements at colliders  @xcite . on the second part",
    "we compare this phenomenology with the one that is derived from abandoning the assumption of the higgs as an @xmath1 doublet .",
    "we study in this case the higgs interactions using the non  linear or chiral effective lagrangian including a dynamical higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the interesting higgs to gauge boson coupling correlation with the tgv interactions could be lost in this case , besides higher order differences , that both could lead to phenomenological observable consequences  @xcite useful to disentangle the nature of the observed state .",
    "we start assuming that , even if there is np associated with the ewsb sector , the observed particle is an elementary state which belongs to a light electroweak doublet scalar , and consequently , that the @xmath2 symmetry is linearly realized in the effective theory .",
    "thus we think of the sm as an effective low energy theory but we still retain the gauge group , the particle spectrum and the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking as valid ingredients to describe nature at energies @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scale associated to np .",
    "this fixes the complete set of higher dimensional operators that need to be considered at a given order . neglecting the effects of the dimension  five total lepton number violating operator , the lowest order effective operators that can be built are of dimension  six : @xmath5 where the operators @xmath6 have couplings @xmath7 .",
    "if we restrict to @xmath8 and @xmath9even dimension  six operators , 29 of them are relevant to study the higgs interactions  @xcite barring flavor structure and hermitian conjugations .",
    "eight of those modify the higgs interactions to the electroweak gauge bosons , one to gluons and one affects only higgs self interactions .",
    "additionally there are three yukawa  like fermionic operators , and the remaining ones modify both the fermionic couplings to the higgs boson as well as to the gauge bosons",
    ". finally tgv interactions of on - shell @xmath10 s are modified by four of these operators , as well as , by one operator that only involves the electroweak gauge ",
    "boson self ",
    "couplings , @xmath11 , see  @xcite .",
    "previous to the analysis of the higgs data the equations of motion can be used to eliminate redundant operators from @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , several operators are already strongly constrained by the use of electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) , to which they contribute at the tree level . for a detailed discussion on the reduction of the number of parameters in our effective lagrangian",
    "see  @xcite . after the choice of the basis presented there , the effective lagrangian relevant for the analysis of higgs and tgv data , and the subdominant effects to ewpd",
    "is reduced to @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the higgs doublet , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath1 ( @xmath20 ) gauge coupling @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and pauli matrices @xmath23 .    the dimension  six operators in the final basis to be studied , eq .",
    "( [ ourleff ] ) , contribute to the interactions of the higgs boson with the sm particles , in some cases adding new lorentz structures in the different vertices , as it was discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , two of them , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , contribute to the tgv interactions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , whose contributions in the commmonly used parametrization of  @xcite are :        @xmath28    with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and where @xmath31(@xmath32 ) is the sine ( cosine ) of the weak mixing angle .",
    "for completeness we note that @xmath11 contributes to the tgv parametrization in  @xcite as @xmath33 , although it has no relevance for the present note",
    ". finally , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 also give subdominant ( loop ) contributions to ewpd .    in order to constrain these higher dimensional deviations with respect to the standard model expected behaviour",
    "we build a @xmath39 function based on the signal strength measurements of the higgs production and decay at both the tevatron and lhc , together with the addition of the most precise determination of tgv s at the colliders in the present framework , as well as the inclusion of ewpd in a simplified way in terms of the oblique parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the details on the data included on this global analysis , as well as the statistical details of the fit are described thoroughly in  @xcite .      in order to study the present bounds on the higgs interactions from higgs ,",
    "tgv and ewpd sets we perform several global analyses including different data and dimension  six operator sets .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dima ] .    in the figure",
    "one can see the @xmath42 dependence on the fit parameters when we consider all higgs collider data ( red solid lines ) , higgs collider plus tgv data ( dashed purple lines ) , and higgs collider plus tgv and ewpd ( dotted blue lines ) . in the columns we show the @xmath42 dependence with respect to the fit parameter written in the bottom of the column , with @xmath43 given in tev@xmath44 , and while the rest of undisplayed parameters have been marginalized .",
    "in the upper row we use @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 as fit parameters with @xmath51 , while in the bottom row the fitting parameters are @xmath45 , @xmath52 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . with the precision reachable from the considered data sets the main conclusion that we can extract",
    "is that so far all the considered higgs and gauge interactions are completely compatible with the sm higgs hypothesis .",
    "this causes all the @xmath42 panels to have the minima close to the 0 point ( sm point ) without any statistically significant deviation with respect to the sm pattern of interactions .",
    "the degeneracies in @xmath45 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are due to the interference with the sm corresponding vertices .",
    "in addition , by comparing the results for the upper and lower operator sets considered , we can observe that the introduction of the fermionic operators to the analysis has a negligible effect on @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "an exception is the observed weakening of the exclusion ranges on @xmath45 , which is strongly related to the inclusion of @xmath53 , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:1dima ] is useful to illustrate some of the interesting features and the potential of the data  driven approach , as it allows us to identify which of the data sets impose the strongest constraints on a given operator .",
    "for instance , by looking at either the @xmath48 or @xmath49 panels , either the upper or the lower row , we could already foresee comparing the results from the analysis of the higgs data to the results from the combined analysis of higgs and tgv data that the precision reachable from both data sets on @xmath48 or @xmath49 is at a similar level .",
    "a conclusion that drives us directly to the following subsection .",
    "as we have commented , two of the operators , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , contribute both to the higgs interactions with the gauge bosons , and to tgv interactions . in the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dima ] we have used this double contribution on the direction of adding tgv data to the global analysis of the dimension  six operators in order to further constrain the coefficients of the operators considered in eq .",
    "( [ ourleff ] ) .",
    "conversely , we can exploit this double contribution on qualitatively the opposite direction .",
    "we present now the global analysis of only higgs data , but this time we rotate the exclusion bounds derived from the results to bounds on the tgv parameters by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : wwv ] ) . as we have observed in the previous subsection that the fermionic operators do not affect the electroweak ones , for simplicity we show in this subsection the results of the space spanned by @xmath55 .",
    "we present the results of the analysis to the higgs data only in fig .",
    "[ fig : tgv ] .",
    "there we plot in the red filled region the 95% c.l . allowed values in the plane @xmath56 after marginalizing over the other four parameters on the higgs analysis , @xmath57 and @xmath50 , _",
    "i.e. _  we define @xmath58 and we impose the two - dimensional 95% c.l .",
    "allowed region from the condition @xmath59 .     from the global analysis of only higgs data from the lhc and tevatron",
    "( red filled region ) , and relevant bounds from tgv measurements in different collider experiments as labeled in the panel .",
    "we also show the estimated constraints obtainable by combining these bounds ( hatched region).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the figure we also show the relevant 95% c.l .",
    "bounds from tgv measurements in different collider experiments as properly labeled .",
    "these experimental measurements were all performed in the framework given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wwv ] ) , for further details see  @xcite . as we can observe in the figure , the direct measurements of tgv s and the results derived from the global analysis of higgs data translated to the tgv space , are not only complementary because of the different correlation that they present , but actually the precision reachable from both types of determinations are at a comparable level . as a consequence",
    ", this interesting complementarity between both analysis can be used as a further test of the sm and of the linearly realized ewsb . in the future ,",
    "when the data sets are extended , the combination of both types of analysis has the potential to furnish the strongest possible bounds on this anomalous tgv space . indeed , after performing the current combination of results , as described in  @xcite , the hatched region in fig .",
    "[ fig : tgv ] sets the strongest 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion region of the ones currently available .",
    "we proceed now to compare the phenomenology of the effective lagrangian expasion assuming a linear realization of the ewsb with the phenomenology of the non  linear or chiral lagrangian expansion , including a light higgs , but in this case generically as a singlet of @xmath1 .",
    "while the first expansion is suitable for models with elementary higgs particles , the second one may be more adequated for  dynamical \" -composite- ones .",
    "for the non  linear case we consider the construction of the effective lagrangian presented in  @xcite , up to four derivatives in the expansion and including the bosonic and yukawa  like @xmath8 and @xmath9 even operators and @xmath9 violating operators to be included and studied  @xcite . ] . for the comparison of the phenomenology",
    ", we can start restricting to the subset of chiral operators that include the same gauge interactions that are already introduced by the dimension ",
    "six operators in the linear expansion , _",
    "i.e. _  we consider the chiral structures weighted by the parameter @xmath60 in  @xcite .",
    "the lesser symmetry constraints in the non  linear effective lagrangian means more possible invariant operators at a given order , which is translated into phenomenological decorrelations with respect to the linear case , differences that we present here .",
    "for instance , in the unitary gauge , two of the non  linear operators , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the notation of  @xcite , read :    @xmath63    with their coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 taking arbitrary ( model dependent ) values , and where the model dependent functions @xmath66 encode the chiral interactions of the light @xmath67 . in contrast , the @xmath68 operator containing the same gauge interactions , @xmath25 , results in the combination :    @xmath69    in consequence , in a general non  linear analysis the @xmath70 interactions get decorrelated from the @xmath71 and @xmath72 couplings , all encoded in @xmath25 , and for the precise lorentz structures shown above .",
    "these interactions construct in the linear case the correlation that leads to the interesting complementarity between higgs data analysis and the direct measurement of tgv s that we have highlighted in the previous section when exploiting the effective lagrangian analysis in the linear realization of the ewsb . thus in order to study whether the ewsb mechanism presents a correlated or a decorrelated behaviour , we can perform the global analysis of higgs , tgv and ewpd in the context of the non  linear effective lagrangian , what is the first 8dimensional analysis in this basis  @xcite . while the complete details of such study can be found in  @xcite , here we only show a subset of the two  dimensional results . but instead of showing the ranges of results as a function of the coefficients of the non  linear operators included in the global analysis , we rotate part of the coefficients to a new set of variables , see  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nl1 ] , where the results of the combined analysis of the data sets considered have been projected into combinations of the non  linear operators @xmath61 , @xmath73 , @xmath62 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 defined such that at order @xmath68 of the linear expansion @xmath76 , @xmath77 , while @xmath78 . in the expressions @xmath79 and @xmath80",
