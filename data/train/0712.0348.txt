    "<S> the goal is to identify the local degrees of freedom relevant to the physics of the ground state and to retain them in the hilbert space @xmath5 , whose dimension @xmath6 must be large enough to describe this physics . </S>",
    "<S> a severe problem of such approach is that in @xmath7 dimensions , @xmath6 must grow ( doubly ) exponentially in @xmath8 @xcite as a result of the accumulation of short - range entanglement at the boundary of the block .    </S>",
    "<S> _ entanglement renormalization _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is a novel real - space rg transformation recently proposed in order to solve the above difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> its defining feature is the use of _ disentanglers _ prior to the coarse - graining step . </S>",
    "<S> these are unitary operations , acting on the interface of the blocks defined by the rg procedure , that reduce the amount of entanglement in the system , see figure [ figure:2dmera ] . </S>",
    "<S> a major achievement of the approach is that , when applied to a large class of ground states in both one @xcite and two @xcite spatial dimensions , the dimension @xmath9 is seen not to grow with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> a steady @xmath9 is made possible by the disentangling step and has several implications @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> local symmetry breaking phases are described by a symmetry group and a local order parameter , and they are associated with the physical mechanism of condensation of point - like objects . </S>",
    "<S> transitions between two such phases or orders involve a change in the symmetry , as described by landau s theory . </S>",
    "<S> a simple picture emerges from the perspective of entanglement renormalization @xcite : under successive iterations of the rg transformation , ground states with local symmetry breaking order progressively lose their entanglement and eventually converge to a trivial fixed point , namely an unentangled ground state . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> critical ground states describing transitions between these phases are non - trivial that is , entangled fixed points of the rg transformation . in either case </S>",
    "<S> , the mera provides an efficient , accurate representation of the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> topological phases are fundamentally different from local symmetry breaking phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they do not stem from ( the breakdown of ) local group symmetries , but their _ topological order _ is linked to more complex mathematical objects , like tensor categories , topological quantum field theory , and quantum groups . </S>",
    "<S> physically , topological phases exhibit gapped ground levels with robust degeneracy dependent only on the topology of the underlying space . </S>",
    "<S> this , and the fact that excitations above the ground level possess anyonic statistics , boosts the interest of these phases as scenarios for topological quantum information storage and processing . </S>",
    "<S> condensation of string - like objects ( in the so - called string - net models , see @xcite ) has been proposed as a general mechanism controlling topological phases . </S>",
    "<S> as may be expected , such profound differences are also reflected in the way the ground state is entangled . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the notion of topological entanglement entropy @xcite ( the subleading term in a large - perimeter expansion of the entanglement entropy of a system ) has arisen as a quantitative measure of the ground state entanglement due to topological effects . </S>",
    "<S> systems with topological order thus provide an unexplored scenario for entanglement renormalization techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to establish entanglement renormalization and the mera as valid tools also for the description and investigation of topological phases of matter . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail kitaev s toric code @xcite , a four - fold degenerate ground state widely discussed in the context of quantum computation and closely related to @xmath10 lattice gauge theory @xcite and to the simplest of levin - wen s models for string - net condensation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show the following : ( @xmath11 ) a mera with finite , constant @xmath9 can represent the toric code _ </S>",
    "<S> exactly _ ; ( @xmath12 ) at each iteration of the rg transformation , entanglement renormalization factors out local degrees of freedom from the lattice , while leaving the topological degrees of freedom untouched ; @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> the mera representation of the four ground states is identical except in its top tensor , which stores the topological degrees of freedom ; and ( @xmath14 ) in an infinite system , the toric code is the fixed point of this rg transformation . all these results also hold for more complicated models , such as quantum double lattice models , that we discuss in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the mera is naturally fitted to represent states with topological order , and the entanglement renormalization offers a new , useful framework for further studies .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , we consider a square lattice @xmath15 on the torus , with spin-@xmath16 ( qubit ) degrees of freedom attached to each link . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath17 is a sum of constraint operators associated with vertices ` @xmath18 ' and plaquettes ` @xmath19 , ' namely @xmath20 stabilizers @xmath21 act as a simultaneous spin flip in all four qubits adjacent to a given vertex . </S>",
    "<S> stabilizers @xmath22 yield the product of group assignments @xmath23 at the four qubits around a plaquette . all stabilizers commute with each other and have eigenvalues @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian ( [ kitaevhamiltonian ] ) is gapped , and states in the ground level ( kitaev states ) are simultaneous eigenstates of all @xmath21 , @xmath22 with eigenvalue @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the ground level ( i.e. , the number of kitaev states ) depends on the topology of the manifold underlying the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> if this manifold is a topologically nontrivial riemann surface , information is encoded in nontrivial cycles , since operators @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are nontrivial cycles along bonds of the lattice , commute with all stabilizers . besides , such operators along homologically equivalent nontrivial cycles @xmath27 , @xmath28 have the same action on kitaev states . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for a torus , two logical qubits are encoded in the action of these operators .    </S>",
    "<S> kitaev states are efficiently written in terms of their stabilizers . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilizer formalism @xcite also provides us with a useful language to analyse the action of operators on kitaev states , and has proved instrumental in finding an exact mera . </S>",
    "<S> the key observation to this purpose is that there exist ` elementary moves ' @xcite , minimal deformations of the lattice and its kitaev states , that respect the topological characteristics of the code . </S>",
    "<S> these moves consists of addition or removal of faces and vertices together with qubits , and can be written in terms of controlled - not ( cnot ) operators , whose adjoint action has a very simple expression in terms of stabilizers : @xmath29 figure [ figure : elemmoves ] depicts the construction of elementary moves . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of a face is achieved by introducing a new spin in a plaquette . </S>",
    "<S> arrows stand for cnot operators from control qubits ( all qubits in one of the semiplaquettes ) to the target qubit ( the new qubit , introduced in state @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the following transformation of stabilizers holds ( the new site is denoted as @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 which ensures plaquette constraints are obeyed . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the two relevant vertex constraints are extended to the new qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of a new vertex is achieved instead by introducing a new qubit in state @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this qubit now plays the role of control for cnots acting on the qubits adjacent to one of the split vertices . </S>",
    "<S> stabilizers transform as @xmath34 which is again compatible with the code constraints . </S>",
    "<S> both final sets of operators are the correct stabilizers for the code in the modified lattice ( remember that @xmath35 . ) </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the two relevant paquette constraints are extended to the new qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> these operations can be inverted to _ decouple _ qubits in states @xmath30 and @xmath33 from the rest system . </S>",
    "<S> the disentanglers and isometries , defining both the rg transformation and the mera for the kitaev states , are made of several of these decoupling moves . </S>",
    "<S> we regard the original square lattice @xmath15 , on which the toric code is defined , as a ( tilted ) square lattice @xmath3 where each site contains four qubits . </S>",
    "<S> then both disentanglers and isometries act on blocks of four sites of @xmath3 as in figure [ figure:2dmera ]  equivalently , on blocks of 16 qubits in @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> they consist of a series of cnots as specified in figures [ figure : meraa ] and [ figure : merab ] .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a)(b )    ( a)(b )    ( c)(d )    upon applying the rg transformation , we obtain a coarse - grained lattice @xmath36 which is locally identical to @xmath37 and where , by construction , the toric code constraints are still satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite remarkable . on the one hand , it is the first non - trivial example , in the context of entanglement renormalization , where the rg transformation is _ exact _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , leading to the first non - trivial model that can be _ exactly _ described with the mera . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we consider an infinite lattice , the above observation implies that kitaev states are an explicit fixed point of the rg flow in the space of ground states , as induced by the present rg transformation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider a finite lattice @xmath37 on the torus . </S>",
    "<S> the coarse - grained state carries exactly the same topological information ( values of @xmath38 along nontrivial cycles ) as the original state , since the elementary moves preserve such information at each intermediate step . </S>",
    "<S> that is , different kitaev states are not mixed during the rg transformation . by iteration </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a sequence of increasingly coarse - grained lattices @xmath39 for ever smaller toruses . </S>",
    "<S> the top lattice @xmath40 will contain only a few qubits . recall that the mera is made of all the disentanglers and isometries used in the rg transformations , together with a top tensor describing the state of @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the meras for different states of the toric code will contain identical disentanglers and isometries , and will only differ in their top tensor , where all the topological information is stored .    </S>",
    "<S> all the above results automatically extend to the loop model considered by levin and wen as the simplest of their family of string - net models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the toric code on a square lattice can be locally transformed , using the decoupling moves depicted in figure [ figure : merabis ] , into a toric code on a triangular lattice , which is equivalent to the ground state of the loop model defined on the dual ( hexagonal ) lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this local transformation shows that the topological order of both models are identical , a fact already pointed out in @xcite and which can also be understood in terms of the projected entangled - pair state ansatz ( peps ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a)(b )    finally , our construction generalizes almost straightfowardly to quantum double models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , both for abelian and non - abelian groups . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by replacing cnots with controlled group multiplication operators and by paying due attention to the order of the operations ( see appendix ) .    in conclusion , we have shown that several models with topological order can be exactly represented with the mera , where topological degrees of freedom are naturally isolated in its top tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we have also seen that such models are fixed points of the rg flow induced by entanglement renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> our results are an unambiguous sign that entanglement renormalization and the mera , originally developed to efficiently simulate systems with local symmetry - breaking phases , provide also a most natural framework to study topological phases .    </S>",
