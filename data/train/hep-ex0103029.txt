    "in year 2000 , a number of improvements were made to the lep collider .",
    "it increased higgs discovery potential up to approximately 115 gev if lep combination were made .",
    "in lepc held in november 2000 , an excess of candidates , which is compatible with the standard model(sm ) higgs boson of 115 gev , was reported@xcite .",
    "the results of a search for the sm higgs boson with the opal detector at lep was reported in this talk based on the results described in published letter@xcite .",
    "the data used in the analyses correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 216 pb@xmath1 at 192202 gev , 80 pb@xmath1 at 203206 gev , and 130 pb@xmath1 at centre - of - mass energies ( @xmath2 ) higher than 206 gev . during 2000 ( 1999 ) , data were taken at @xmath3 - 209 gev ( 192 - 202 gev ) with a luminosity - weighted mean @xmath2 of 206.1 ( 197.6 ) gev .",
    "the analyses follows our previous publication@xcite .",
    "the search was performed in the following final states , @xmath4bbqq ( four - jet ) , @xmath4bb  ( missing energy ) , @xmath4bb  and qq ( tau ) , @xmath4bb and @xmath4bb ( electron and muon ) .    in all channels , preselections followed by likelihood selections were applied to select the higgs signal .",
    "the likelihood consists of b - tagging information , event shape variables , lepton identification , ( in)compatibilities to the signal(background ) mass hypothesis and so on .",
    "the likelihood selection were optimised using a mixture of various masses of signal monte carlo samples . hence",
    ", the selection was not optimized to a particular mass .",
    "the b - tagging variable @xmath5 is a likelihood combination of three independent b - tagging information , lifetime sensitive part , jet kinematics and lepton @xmath6 information .",
    "lifetime sensitive part is an artificial neural network consists of four input variables including both displaced vertex and track impact parameter information .",
    "the performance of b - tagging was checked using the calibration data taken at  peak in 2000 , as well as higher energy data as shown in figure[fig : btag ] .     for jets",

    "three different final discriminants , `` test statistic '' , were used in different channels to reflect the different background conditions .",
    "the four - jet channel uses a likelihood consists of four variables including b - tagging , reconstructed mass and two event shape parameters . the missing energy , electron and muon channel uses likelihood calculated from mass and selection likelihood output .",
    "the tau channel uses simply the mass distribution as a test statistic .",
