    "since its introduction by feder @xcite , random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) became a well established method used for modelling of adsorption properties .",
    "although at the beginning it was used mainly to model adsorption of simple spherical molecules , recent results shows that it could be effective also for quite complex structures like proteins @xcite .",
    "most of the research effort focuses on adsorption of hard objects where geometry is the only factor affecting properties of obtained monolayers . on the other hand ,",
    "adsorption is often induced by electrostatic interaction between adsorbate and collector , e.g. @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the hard body interaction can still be sufficiently good approximation because the electrostatic forces are screened in a solution which makes them negligible . however in the general case",
    ", they should be taken into account to find out the level of systematic error provided by such interactionless approximation .",
    "the purpose of presented paper is to extend previous investigations of dimers adsorption @xcite to include the case on non - negligible electrostatic repulsion .",
    "the paper focuses on fundamental properties of dimer monolayers , such us maximal random coverage ratio , density autocorrelation and orientational ordering , as well as on adsorption kinetics .",
    "the additional aim is to develop robust numerical procedure to convert data obtained from rsa to values measured during typical adsorption experiment .",
    "a single dimer particle is assumed to consist of two identical , charged , spherical particles ( see fig.[fig : dimers ] ) .",
    ".,width=144 ]    in rsa studies of soft particles electostatic interaction potential between particles has been typically an exponentially decaying yukawa potential , due to forming a double layer from solvent particles , which effectively screens the electrostatic charge of an adsorbate .",
    "therefore , such potential is also known as screened electrostatic potential @xcite . here",
    ", we assumed that the potential given by a single spherical monomer of radius @xmath0 is equal to @xmath1 $ ] for @xmath2 and infinite otherwise . here",
    "@xmath3 denotes distance from a monomer centre .",
    "parameter @xmath4 characterises electrostatic properties of monomer and of a solvent .",
    "range of the interaction is controlled by @xmath5 commonly called as the debye screening length .",
    "it is a key parameter for electrostatic interaction in electrolytes and can be calculated as @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the permittivity of free space ; @xmath8 denotes the dielectric constant of a solvent ; @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant ; @xmath10 denotes temperature ; @xmath11 , elementary charge ; and @xmath12 , the ionic strength of electrolyte solution .",
    "table [ tab : le ] contains typical values of @xmath5 for the most common solutions .",
    ".@xmath5 in nm for typical electrolytes characterised by different ratio of cations to anions .",
    "values were taken from @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     relation ( [ asf_fit ] ) gives the best fit when interaction range is small .",
    "for large @xmath5 the asf quickly approaches exponential function rather than polynomial one , which can be clearly seen when using logarithmic scale .",
    "in general , the fit given by ( [ asf_fit ] ) breaks when @xmath13 becomes exponential . for @xmath14 , it takes place at @xmath15 , whereas for @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "numerical results of dimers adsorption were compared with experimental data of insulin adsorption obtained by mollmann et al.@xcite .",
    "therefore , we set the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 m^2^/s , and dimer surface @xmath19 m^2^. the bulk concentration was @xmath20 mg / ml . the value of adsorption reaction rate had not been specified explicitly ; therefore , we used @xmath21 m / s in our calculation .",
    "results are presented in figure [ fig : kinetics ] were obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ kineticstheta])([b2 ] ) using @xmath22 designated in sec.[sec : asf ] .",
    "the details about numerical procedure used here , to solve diffusion equation are described in [ kinetics_procedure ] .",
    "the units used here are commonly used by experimenters",
    ".     values .",
    "dots are taken from experiment @xcite.,width=240 ]    presented plots drawn for different electrostatic interaction range are similar .",
    "the most noticeable difference is connected with maximum coverage ratio @xmath23 , which strongly depends on interaction range ( see fig.[fig : ratio_le ] and tab.[tab : ratio_le ] ) .",
    "however , it can be noticed that the saturation occurs faster with the growth of interaction range , which is a direct consequence of the @xmath22 shape .",
    "the difference between simulation and experimental data result mainly from different values of the maximal random coverage ratios .",
    "the causes of this effect were already discussed earlier @xcite . apart from this ,",
    "the shapes of numerically and experimentally determined kinetics are similar .",
    "the random maximal coverages ratio for electrostatically interacting dimers was measured using the rsa method .",
    "repulsive interactions lowers the maximum possible coverages ratio the more the larger interaction range @xmath24 is , eg .",
    "@xmath25 for @xmath14 and @xmath26 for @xmath16 ; however , it does not affect the validity of the feder s law .",
    "the measurement of autocorrelation function allows to find out the characteristic distance between neighbouring molecules and its value changes from @xmath27 for @xmath14 to @xmath28 for @xmath16 .",
    "the spontaneous orientational ordering is imperceptible at the global scale but it can occur locally and can be exaggerated by the presence of boundaries .",
    "the adsorption kinetics depends mainly on maximal coverage ratio but it can be observed that saturation value is approached faster for larger @xmath5 .",
    "this work was supported by mnisw / n n204 439040 .",
    "there are known some algorithms for calculating adsorption kinetics in case of adsorption @xcite ; however , we want to introduce here another scheme based only on diffusion equations ( [ kineticstheta])([b2 ] ) , which can be easily applied to any chemical reaction .",
    "therefore , the diffusion equation is solved using standard crank - nicholson method ; however , the introduction of boundary conditions requires additional operations after each step of the algorithm , which are described below :    i ) : :    the concentration having the largest @xmath29 coordinate is set    to @xmath30 .",
    "ii ) : :    the adsorption probability is given by :    @xmath31    it has been proved that the above relation fully satisfies robin    boundary conditions ( [ b2 ] ) @xcite . following relations are direct    consequences of the above .",
    "the number of particles near the surface is    equal to @xmath32    thus , the number of adsorbed molecules is :    @xmath33    @xmath34 and @xmath35 are space and time    discretisation steps used in crank - nicholson algorithm .",
    "the coverage    increase corresponding to the above number @xmath36 is    given by :    @xmath37    so the concentration near surface changes according to    @xmath38\\ ] ]    to use the above algorithm , the diffusion constant @xmath39 , available surface function @xmath22 and reaction rate @xmath40 is needed .",
    "the diffusion constant depends on adsorbed molecule properties ( shape , mass ) as well as solvent properties and it can be measured experimentally .",
    "@xmath22 can be easily determined from rsa simulation as a rsa success rate of placing a particle on a given layer .",
    "the adsorption reaction rate @xmath40 can be expressed in terms of physical parameters characterising the system such as the particle diffusion coefficient , specific energy distribution , depth equilibrium state , and height of the adsorption energy barrier @xcite . for barrier - less adsorption regime ,",
    "the adsorption constant is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the thickens of adsorption boundary and @xmath43 is the minimum distance between molecule in bulk phase and surface @xcite .",
    "reaction rate can also be measured experimentally or used as a parameter which can be fitted to obtain the best possible agreement between experiment and numerical simulation .",
