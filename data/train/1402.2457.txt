    "a long standing problem in solar physics is how the solar corona is heated up to a temperature of few million degrees while the photosphere is at about 6000 k. several models have been developed either to heat the coronal plasma locally or to transport heat from the lower layers of the solar atmosphere into the corona ( see for instance review by @xcite @xcite ) , however , these models often lack an explanation for an average temperature of 1mk for the entire corona and its sustainability during a solar cycle .",
    "this strongly suggests that several mechanisms may be at play , each of them providing a substantial amount of heat to the corona and , which can vary during the activity cycle of the sun .",
    "those models also invoke smaller spatial and time scales than the ones provided by the current observations .",
    "so , the critical issue is really to answer the questions : where is the source of heat located ? and where and how does the heating take place ? along a given magnetic structure ( often a coronal loop ) , three scenarios are often considered : the release of energy is located ( i ) at the footpoints of the structure in the photospheric layer which is the most favorable location owed to the importance of the photospheric motions and the source of material and energy transported from the convection zone , ( ii ) at the apex of the structure , and ( iii ) uniformly along the structure .",
    "those three scenarios imply that the heat is transported along the magnetic structures , and that we actually observe loop - like structures in the corona . in terms of observations",
    ", it has been difficult to disentangle the actual location of the heat source . as an example , several authors using a dataset obtained in soft x - rays by _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt have reached an opposite conclusion depending on how they dealt with the data reduction @xcite . to determine the possible heating scenario , the authors looked at the profile of temperature along the coronal loop and compared with a theoretical model .",
    "these indirect methods were needed because of the coarse spatial and time resolutions of _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt ( compared to what can be achieved nowadays ) . in this paper , with the development of new high spatial and time resolution instrumentation , we are looking for a direct evidence of the source of heat deposition , observationally charaterised by a small , short increase in intensity .",
    "theoretically , the different heating locations ( apex , uniform or footpoint ) arise from the idea that magnetic energy stored in the chromosphere / corona produces small , short bursts converting the magnetic energy into thermal and/or kinetic energy ( rapidly converted into heat ) .",
    "this is the basic principle of @xcite s theory ( @xcite ) for heating the solar corona by nanoflares . a large number of those small events is needed to sustain and uniformly distribute the heat in the entire solar corona .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the release of magnetic energy could be , for instance , magnetic reconnection , wave mode coupling or turbulence . as a large amount of the free energy contained in the magnetic field structure of active regions is located at the base of the corona or in the chromosphere @xcite , the most favorable heating location is at the footpoints of coronal loops . for the quiet sun ,",
    "the footpoints of the coronal strucutres are the most effected by the photospheric motions such as granular motions which can easily produce tangled / braided / twisted magnetic flux bundles . in this paper , we combine euv observations and a magnetic field model to determine if parker s model is a viable scenario , even if we can not identify the mechanism(s ) responsible for the energy release .",
    "high - resolution ground - based instruments in the visible - wavelength domain allowed to observe new structures and phenomena in the lower layers of the solar atmosphere , especially small - scale brightenings or events such as spicules or ellerman bombs ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in conjunction ,",
    "the investigation of the coronal plasma at euv wavelengths is in constant improvement in terms of spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "for instance , the atmospheric imager assembly ( aia ; @xcite @xcite ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; @xcite @xcite ) is largely contributing to a new era of fast ( 12s ) small - scale ( pixel size of 0.6 ) observations of the solar corona always discovering new phenomena .",
    "as a new step forward , the hi - c instrument has provided high - temporal ( 5.5s ) and high - spatial ( pixel size of 0.1 ) resolution observations of the euv corona . using this dataset ,",
    "@xcite have recently shown the existence of small - scale braided structures within the active region , and evidenced the magnetic reconnection process occurring within the braided structures .",
    "in addition , two recent articles relying on hi - c data have provided new insights in the existence of small - scale heating events .",
    "@xcite have found that the active region moss is highly dynamic with a variability on timescales of 15s , and the moss brightenings lead to an energy release of 10@xmath1 erg ( order of magnitude consistent with the nanoflare model ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite have investigated transient brightenings along small - scale transition - region loops .",
    "it was found that the loops have a diameter ranging from 0.9  to 1.1  with an average duration of 64s .",
    "@xcite have estimated that these brightenings radiate an energy of about 10@xmath210@xmath3 erg again an energy estimate consistent with the nanoflare model .    in this paper , we report on the existence of an additional heat source for the coronal plasma : euv , short - lived ( 25 s ) , small - scale ( @xmath41 ) brightenings taking place in the low layers of the solar atmosphere ( log t = 5.56.5 ) .",
    "we call these brightenings euv bright dots ( ebds ) .",
    "this new discovery is made possible by the high spatial resolution and fast time cadence of the hi - c data .    in section  [ sec : obs ] , after introducing the hi - c instrument , we characterize the location , size , and thermal properties of ebds as derived from the hi - c channel and six sdo / aia channels .",
    "we thus study their time evolution in the observed region ( section  [ sec : dyn ] ) , as well as their magnetic properties ( section  [ sec : mag ] ) relying on a potential field extrapolation of one sdo / hmi magnetogram . in section  [ sec : em_loci ] , the possible temperature of ebds is investigated using the em loci method .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the high - resolution coronal ( hi - c ) imager was launched on a sounding rocket on july 11 , 2012 @xcite .",
    "the hi - c passband isolates a very narrow window in euv centered at 193  , taking images with a pixel size of 0.1 .",
    "the intensity line profile is dominated by an emission line of fe xii with a peak temperature at 1.5 mk ( log t = 6.17 ) , and blended by some weak transition region lines , as well as including 10 - 15 mk emission during large flares .",
    "the main target of the hi - c instrument was the complex system of active regions located around the central meridian in the southern hemisphere ( active regions noaa 11519 - 21 ) , and which indeed mostly contains the active region 11520 ( ar11520 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hic_context ] , we plot the full hi - c field - of - view ( fov ) centered approximately at [ -150 , -281 ] arcseconds from the sun center .",
    "we extract the region of interest containing the ebds discussed in this paper .",
    "the size of the ebds fov is of approximately 35@xmath530 . magnetically , ar11520 is a collection of 7 - 8 sunspots as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : bz ] left .",
    "the hi - c time series lasts during 200 s from 18:52:09 ut to 18:55:29 ut with a time cadence of 5.5 s ( 36 images ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : hic_aia_int ] , we compare the euv emission at 193  observed in hi - c ( left ) and sdo / aia ( right , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "even if centered on the same wavelength , the hi - c and sdo / aia filters are similar but not identical .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the hi - c observations provides further insights into the small - scale coronal structures / phenomena observed as localized brightenings ; ebds that can be resolved in the hi - c fov are seen as compact bright regions in the sdo / aia fov . to extract the signature of the ebds",
    ", we proceed in three consecutive steps : ( i ) applying a median filter to a single frame , ( ii ) considering the intensities above the 3@xmath6-level ( standard deviation of the intensity map in a single frame ) , and ( iii ) adding the intensities of the frames together over the whole hi - c time series .",
    "we thus can define the locations of significant bright dots ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hic_aia_int ] bottom left ) , and subsequently study their time evolution and geometrical properties . here",
    ", eight significant bright dots are identified ( as depicted by the rectangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : hic_aia_int ] bottom left ) .",
    "the eight different ebds have been chosen as they are associated with a well - defined structure in individual images : elliptical structures of more than 9 pixels and with an intensity above the 3@xmath6-level ( standard deviation of a single frame ) . even if they do not obey the criteria imposed above",
    ", other brightenings ( not classified as ebds ) exist in the fov , which suggest that smaller spatial - scale structures can exist .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : hic_aia_int ] bottom right , the location of the ebds selected in the hi - c image ( left ) is compared to the sdo / aia image ( right ) processed with the same methodology as the hi - c data : most of the chosen ebds can be identified in both fields - of - view .",
    "solely based on the images , the signal is much weaker for the sdo / aia observations , and thus using sdo / aia observations alone would not provide confidence of their existence ; only the comparison with the hi - c images ensures that the sdo / aia ebds are true brightenings and not just noise .      using the capabilities of the sdo / aia instrument ,",
    "we study the ebds using six other wavelength channels covering from the low chromosphere to the high temperature corona ( 1600 , 304 , 131 , 171 , 211 , and 335 ) . in fig .  [ fig : aia_im ] top , we plot the integrated images over the whole hi - c time series in the different channels for the same fov . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aia_im ] bottom , we apply the same data analysis procedure to the time series for the six wavelength channels in order to enhance the location of ebds .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : aia_im ] , we find the following possible signatures of ebds :    * the 1600  channel does not show much evidence of ebd intensity signature .",
    "* the 304  channel shows a weak emission for some of the ebds . *",
    "the hotter channels ( 131 , 171 , 211 , and 335 ) show a clear evidence of ebd intensity signatures as in the 193  channel .",
    "comparing the temperature response functions of sdo / aia and their overlapping areas @xcite , this multi - channel analysis suggests that the ebds are in a temperature range between 0.3 to 1.5 mk ( @xmath7 ) which implies that the ebds are located at the top of the chromosphere or at the bottom of the corona .          in order to investigate the possible temperature of the ebds ,",
    "the em loci technique was employed : the same method as in @xcite was used , especially to get the temperature response functions of the different sdo / aia and hi - c channels .",
    "the em loci method ( e. g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to determine if a coronal structure is isothermal or multi - thermal without providing more in - depth information ( see fig .  7 in @xcite @xcite for an example of isothermal and multi - thermal loops ) .",
    "we derived the em loci curves of several sdo / aia channels ( 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 ) and the 193  hi - c channel .",
    "a single crossing of all the em loci curves should indicated an isothermal plasma at this temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eml_ebd3 ] , we present the results of the em loci method for ebd3 : there is a clear evidence that three possible temperature regions corresponding to the larger number of loci crossings may be distinguished : one at low temperature at @xmath8 , and two at coronal temperature with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , for all the other ebds studied , the em loci method does not lead to any conclusive temperature , the crossings being distributed between @xmath11 .",
    "the lack of clarity in the em loci curves maybe the result of two points : either ( i ) the size and timing of the ebd s structure at the sdo / aia scale do not permit to draw any firm conclusions ( as noted in section  [ sec : obs ] , the ebds are very difficult to observe in sdo / aia data ) , or ( ii ) the plasma of the ebds is a transition region plasma for which a temperature can not be determined by the lines observed .",
    "the latter will imply that the mechanism to release magnetic energy most likely occurs at the footpoints of the coronal loops .",
    "the behavior of the em loci method for the ebds as observed by sdo / aia is consistent with the study of multi - thermal plasma performed by @xcite .",

    "we extract the magnetic information for each set of magnetic field lines : it is above 1 mm that the magnetic field strength becomes a smoothly , decaying function of height . below 1 mm ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is influenced by the complexity of the magnetic field and the change in orientation of the transverse component ( parallel to the photosphere ) .",
    "it is also below 1 mm that the magnetic field lines plotted in fig .",

    "fig : hic_aia_int ] ) ; ( right ) view from the east side ( north is on the left - hand side),title=\"fig : \" ]    we estimate the magnetic energy associated with the ebds by considering the potential field within a sphere of diameter 0.68 mm ( characteristic size of ebds ) and within 1 mm above the photosphere where the magnetic field strength has been estimated between 200 and 280 g. the magnetic energy is thus between 1.98@xmath510@xmath0 and 3.87@xmath510@xmath0 erg .",
    "an upper bound for the free magnetic energy is about 80% of the previous values , i.e. , 1.583.1@xmath510@xmath0 erg .",
    "the free magnetic energy estimates are of 10@xmath0 erg which are similar to the energy associated with a single micro - flare . thus the magnetic field",
    "associated with the ebds contains enough free magnetic energy to power single or multiple nanoflares as envisioned by @xcite , knowing that a small part of the free magnetic energy is commonly released during flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by invoking an energy release site reduced by a factor of 3 ( 0.23 mm instead of 0.68 mm )",
    ", the magnetic energy estimated reaches the nanoflare scale .",
    "this magnetic energy estimate evidences that the nanoflare model can be a viable mechanism to release magnetic energy at low - heights in the solar atmosphere and thus heat the coronal part of the loop .",
    "the high resolution images obtained in the euv by hi - c allow us to determine the smallest brightenings observed to date in an active region in extreme ultra - violet light , called euv bright dots ( ebds ) .",
    "these ebds sparkle at the footpoints of large - scale coronal loops .",
    "we have grouped the ebds into four categories depending on their recurrence . except for the fourth category ( successive , short - lived ebds ) , individual ebds which can be extracted from the hi - c time series",
    "have the same characteristic duration ( about 25s ) and length scale ( 0.68 mm ) . using a potential field extrapolation of the sdo / hmi line - of - sight photospheric magnetic field",
    ", we have determined that the ebds observed in the hi - c fov are located at the footpoints of large - scale magnetic loops connecting the active regions 11520 to a decaying active region in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the above properties suggest that ebds might be a signature of an impulsive release of energy located at the base of coronal loops .    in terms of energetics ,",
    "the magnetic energy estimate is of the order of 10@xmath0 erg which is 100 times more than required by the nanoflare model suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , our estimate is an upper bound for the free magnetic energy than can be released , thus suggesting that smaller scale structures can exist .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite have estimated the radiated energy to 10@xmath2 erg , which is compatible with the order of magnitude of the magnetic energy : according to @xcite who performed a complete study of the energy partition in eruptive events , the magnetic energy budget can be two orders of magnitude larger than the radiated energy .    even if it is not possible to compare",
    "quantitatively due to the lack of spectroscopic data overlying the hi - c fov , it is important to mention the observations of @xcite , which showed that small - scale brightenings at the footpoints of coronal loops can be observed with a strong redshift velocity close to the local sound speed .",
    "@xcite suggested that spatially unresolved ( @xmath4720 km ) structures could exist at the footpoint of coronal loops .    according to @xcite",
    ", the conduction time - scale can be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the plasma pressure , @xmath53 the characteristic length , @xmath54 the thermal conductivity in the corona ( @xmath55 ) , and @xmath56 is the temperature .",
    "the characteristic length @xmath53 of the loop is chosen to be the loop length along which the heating is assumed to take place : @xmath53 = 5 mm . for a plasma pressure of 0.1 dyne@xmath18@xmath57 and a temperature range from 0.5 to 1.5 mk",
    ", the conductive time - scale is between 6 s at 1.5 mk and 5 min at 0.5 mk .",
    "a characteristic time of 25 s gives a characteristic temperature of 1 mk .",
    "thus , the observed life - time of ebds maybe compatible with the properties of a coronal plasma .    with the restricted observations of the hi - c instrument ( short flight and limited fov ) , questions arise for further study of these elementary events :",
    "how often / common are ebds in active regions ?",
    "are they always located at the footpoints of long coronal loops ? what is their contribution towards the global heating of the corona ?",
    "can ebds be associated with type 2 spicules or even ellerman bombs , both having similar time scales ?",
    "several of these questions can be addressed by finding criteria which will enable the detection of ebds in sdo / aia images going forward , and by using high resolution chromospheric spectroscopic observations from iris .",
