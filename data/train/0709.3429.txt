    "the frhlich hamiltonian describing a single electron coupled to longitudinal optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interaction,@xcite and has represented in the past , in addition to its interest for the solid - state physics , an ideal problem for testing many mathematical methods in quantum field theory.@xcite because of the coupling with the phonon field , the resulting quasi - particle , the polaron , has an effective mass larger , and a ground state energy lower , than the free electron .",
    "these quantities have been investigated for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case by means of perturbation theory for the weak - coupling limit,@xcite and of variational treatments for the intermediate,@xcite and strong - coupling cases.@xcite the path - integral variational calculations of feynman,@xcite and subsequent refinements of this method,@xcite have provided a solid description for all values of the coupling , verified also by improved variational methods,@xcite and by quantum monte - carlo studies.@xcite    the interest aroused some time ago on semiconductor heterojunctions , or other low - dimensional systems , prompted to modify the frhlich model to accounting for two - dimensional ( 2d ) and quasi-2d systems.@xcite by applying the same methods derived for the 3d case , the ground state properties for the strictly 2d case were evaluated for weak , strong and intermediate couplings,@xcite and the obtained systematic lowering of the ground state energy and the enhancing of the effective mass compared to the 3d case has pointed out the role of dimensionality in enhancing the polaronic character.@xcite    concerning the el - ph problem in low dimensions , recent progresses in developing high - quality low - dimensional systems and in material engineering provide hints that , for a vast class of low - dimensional materials , the usual 2d frhlich model , as considered in literature , may be incomplete .",
    "this concern comes about by considering 2d systems exhibiting strong spin - orbit ( so ) splitting of the electronic states due to the inversion asymmetry in the direction orthogonal to the conducting plane ( rashba so mechanism ) .",
    "this situation is encountered in semiconductor quantum wells with asymmetric confining potentials,@xcite in the surface states of metals and semi - metals,@xcite and in surface alloys such as li / w(110),@xcite pb / ag(111),@xcite and bi / ag(111),@xcite with so splitting energies ranging from a few mev in gaas quantum wells to about 0.2 ev in bi / ag(111).@xcite in these systems , therefore , the so energy may be of the same order or even much larger than the typical phonon frequency , rising the question of how such state of affair affects the el - ph interaction , in general , and the frhlich coupling , in particular .    as pointed out in several works,@xcite the rashba interaction describing the",
    "so coupling can have profound effects on the low energy properties of the itinerant electrons .",
    "namely , in the low density regime , the rashba so coupling induces a topological change of the fermi surface of the free electrons , leading to an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the electronic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "in this situation , a 2d low density electron gas would develop , in the presence of so rashba coupling , a phenomenology similar to one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , triggered by the square - root divergence of the ( effectively 1d ) dos at low energies .",
    "some interesting consequences of this scenario on the el - ph problem have already been discussed in ref . [ ] , concerning the superconducting transition , and in ref . [ ] for the effective mass and the spectral properties .",
    "the picture arising from these works , although being limited to the momentum - independent holstein el - ph interaction and to weak - to - moderate couplings , confirms that , for sufficiently low electron densities , the coupling to the phonons is amplified by the so interaction through the 1d - like divergence of the dos .    notwithstanding the relevance of these results for the holstein model",
    ", the use of a local el - ph interaction may however result inadequate in the extremely low electron density regime , where the so effects are more evident.@xcite indeed , the lack of effective screening in this case would rather suggest a long - range interaction as being a more appropriate description of the el - ph coupling .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the 2d frhlich polaron , and its coupling to the so interaction , as a model better describing the unscreened el - ph interaction in 2d rashba systems in the low density limit .    in this article , a single electron moving with a parabolic dispersion in the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 plane",
    "is coupled simultaneously to the rashba so potential and to the phonon degrees of freedom through a frhlich interaction term .",
    "the total system is then described by the 2d frhlich - rashba hamiltonian @xmath2 , where ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 is the hamiltonian for an electron with mass @xmath5 and momentum operator @xmath6 with components @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the spin - vector operator with components given by the pauli matrices , and @xmath9 is the so vector field which in the case of rashba coupling reduces to : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the so coupling parameter .",
    "the phonon part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a phonon with momentum @xmath15 and optical frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the el - ph interaction hamiltonian for the 2d electron coupled to longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons is:@xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dimensionless el - ph coupling constant , with @xmath20 being the electron charge , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 the high frequency and static dielectric constants , respectively .",
    "it is worth clarifying here the significance of the 2d frhlich interaction of eq . with respect to the characteristics of specific materials . for quantum wells and 2d heterostructures , where the electron wave function is assumed here to be confined in a sheet of zero thickness , eq .",
    "describes the coupling of the electron to bulk lo phonons , while the coupling to interface phonon modes is neglected .",
    "the inclusion of such interface phonon contributions may be important in describing specific materials , but it is unnecessary for the present study , where the focus is on the so effects on the unscreened ( long - range ) el - ph interaction , for which eq .",
    "is a paradigm for the 2d case . concerning the el - ph coupling of electronic surface states , eq .",
    "coincides ( apart from a redefinition of @xmath23 ) with the coupling to 2d surface phonons when the coupling to bulk phonons extending below the surface is negligible.@xcite such approximation is coherent with the ideal 2d assumption for the electron wave function , which is physically realized when the electronic surface states have negligible coupling to the bulk",
    ". a further motivation of using the 2d frhlich model is that , in the absence of so interaction , the ground state polaron energy @xmath24 and effective mass @xmath25 have already been studied by several authors,@xcite and the exact results obtained for the weak ( @xmath26 ) and strong ( @xmath27 ) coupling limits provide a useful reference for the effect of nonzero so coupling .    in the present work ,",
    "the 2d frhlich - rashba hamiltonian is studied by considering the weak and strong coupling limits of the el - ph interaction , with arbitrary strength of the so coupling @xmath11 . for @xmath28 the polaron energy @xmath24 and the effective mass @xmath25",
    "are obtained from second order perturbation theory in sec.[weak ] , where numerical and exact analytical results are presented .",
    "it is shown that the effect of @xmath29 is qualitatively similar to that observed in the holstein model,@xcite namely , the so coupling enhances the effective coupling to the phonons . in particular , @xmath24 is lowered by @xmath11 and , simultaneously , the effective mass @xmath25 is enhanced . in sec.[strong ] the strong coupling limit @xmath27 is treated by the variational method , providing a rigorous upper bound of the ground state energy for arbitrary values of the so interaction . as for the weak el - ph coupling case , it is found that @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is lowered ( enhanced ) by the so interaction , implying that the rashba coupling always amplifies the polaronic character , regardless of whether the el - ph interaction is weak or strong .",
    "in the presence of so interaction , the electron wave function is a spinor and its green s function is conveniently represented by a @xmath30 matrix in the spin subspace . for @xmath31 the free electron green s function @xmath32 is readily obtained from @xmath33 : @xmath34g_0^s(k,\\omega),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a 2d electron wavenumber , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the free electron propagator for the two ( @xmath38 ) chiral states characterized by two distinct bands with shifted parabolic dispersions @xmath39 .",

    "the ground state properties are obtained by the electron self - energy evaluated in the second order perturbation theory . at zero temperature ,",
    "the resulting single electron self - energy is therefore : @xmath47 because of the momentum dependence of the frhlich interaction , and contrary to the holstein el - ph case considered in ref .",
    "[ ] , the self - energy is not diagonal in the spin subspace .",

    "however , a different form of the so interaction term may lead to a much weaker effect .",
    "consider for example the situation in which , in addition to the rashba so coupling , the system lacks also of bulk inversion symmetry , as in iii - v semiconductor heterostructures , leading to an extra so term of the dresselhaus type.@xcite when both so contributions are present , the square root divergence of the dos at the bottom of the band of the free electron disappears , and it is replaced by a weaker logarithmic divergence at higher energies . in this situation therefore , at least for weak el - ph couplings , the so interaction is expected to have a weaker effect on the polaron ground state , which tends to vanish as the dresselhaus term becomes comparable to the rashba one .",
    "let us conclude by noticing that , recently , the possibility of varying the coupling of 2d frhlich polarons in a controlled way has been experimentally demonstrated by acting on the dielectric polarizability of organic field - effect transistors.@xcite the results presented here suggest that tunable 2d frhlich polarons may be achieved also by acting on the so coupling , which can be tuned by applied gate voltages in quasi-2d structured materials .",
    "there are however quantitative differences .",
    "indeed , in the strong so limit , the holstein - rashba model gives an effective mass enhancement proportional to @xmath273 , i.e. , a weaker increase with respect to the linear dependence found here for the frhlich - rashba model ( see ref . [ ] ) .",
