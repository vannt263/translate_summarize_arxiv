    "newton s formulation and conceptual framework for mechanics is based on his notions of absolute space and absolute time @xcite",
    ". however , leibniz @xcite , berkeley @xcite and mach @xcite envisaged that mechanics should rather be _",
    "i.e feature solely relative distances , angles and times . despite these occasional criticisms ,",
    "no concrete realizations of such mechanical theories were achieved , and absolutism took hold .",
    "so while lagrange @xcite and jacobi @xcite invented notable techniques for the study of @xmath0 body newtonian mechanics ( nm ) : working in the barycentre frame , using relative particle separation coordinates , using the relative particle cluster separation jacobi coordinates that diagonalize the relative formulation s kinetic term , eliminating one angular momentum and using the jacobi form for the action , they appear not to have assembled these techniques into a relationalist program @xcite .",
    "the first elements of that appear in dziobek @xcite and poincar @xcite .",
    "a concrete relational synthesis was attained by barbour and bertotti in 1982 ( bb82 ) @xcite which i present in sec 2 .",
    "this has also been studied in @xcite , reviewed in @xcite and philosophized about in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a classical relational reformulation of a _ portion of nm_. bb82-type formulations may be perceived to have an undesirable indirectness in that while their derivation ends up free of absolute space , it proceeds indirectly via what may be viewed as absolutist notions ( even if bb82 select these purely on grounds of convenience among various ways of conceptualizing in terms of configuration spaces ) .",
    "it is worth commenting that while it is not logically necessary for a relational viewpoint to lead to a recovery of nm , it is nevertheless interesting for a resolution of the absolute versus relative motion debate to have such a feature .    in this paper",
    "i examine and improve three key features @xcite of bb82 relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) .",
    "firstly , it _ can _ also be cast in a _ directly relational form _",
    ", which i attain in jacobi action relative particle separation coordinate form in sec 3 and furthermore recast in terms of _ relative jacobi coordinates _ in sec 4 .",
    "jacobi coordinates are particularly well - suited to rpm and are mathematically - central to this paper .",
    "secondly , by a ` portion ' i mean the restriction to closed systems / universes of zero total angular momentum ( am ) @xmath1 , that are conservative and have a kinetic term that is homogeneous quadratic in the velocities .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate whether these are major restrictions . in sec 5",
    "i argue that this portion accommodates much , by tricks which counterbalance the _ sub_system of interest with other subsystems elsewhere .",
    "this portion also admits a _",
    "non_homogeneous quadratic extension .",
    "thirdly , i begin to investigate the quantum implications of shifting from an absolutist to a relationalist viewpoint .",
    "this is particularly relevant given how gr and qm incorporate incompatible notions of time .",
    "this ` problem of time ' and its conceptual ramifications are good reasons ( see e.g. @xcite ) why these two areas of theoretical physics have not been successfully combined insofar as we do not have a satisfactory account of quantum gr ( nor a fully satisfactory account of any distinct theory of quantum gravity at all ) . in particular , the traditional framework of qm is based on newton s formulation of particle mechanics , absolute space and time and all , while gr , as well as being a successful reconciliation of sr and newtonian gravity and a successful improvement of the theory of gravitation , is also einstein s attempt to free physics of absolute structure .",
    "many theoretical physicists consider this feature of gr to be an important lesson about how the universe works , to the extent that quantum gravity schemes that , contrarily , have extraneous ` background dependence ' @xcite can be regarded as not yet _ conceptually _ satisfactory .",
    "indeed one major goal of nonperturbative m - theory is to attain this background independence .",
    "now , given that the relational reformulation of @xmath1 nm _ is itself a successful abolition of absolute structure _ , the following interesting question arises .",
    "q1 : does this give a different sort of qm from that of the traditional absolutist approach ?",
    "a further reason for this study is that the bb82 rpm approach to @xmath1 nm closely parallels @xcite that to the geometrodynamical formulation of spatially compact without boundary gr @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite have considered bb82 rpm as a useful toy model arena for the investigation of quantum gravity and quantum cosmology issues such as the problem of time and difficulties with closed universes .",
    "note however that there is a perceived obstruction to this program . while barbour and others have been advocating bb82 rpm as a resolution of the absolute versus relative motion debate for some years , the barbour  smolin ( bs ) preprint @xcite _ also _ claims that quantizing bb82 does not give a good semiclassical limit on two counts .",
    "bs1 : that small masses affect the qm spread of large masses .",
    "bs2 : due to constituent subsystems being interlocked by additional restrictions .",
    "this position is followed up by arguing against the applicability of standard quantization procedures , leading them instead to ` seek a radical alternative ' . @xcite",
    "may be seen as the start of barbour s search for this  a particular _ consistent records _ program .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper i begin by addressing q1 .",
    "this subdivides into whether different formal mathematics becomes involved and whether there are interpretational differences .",
    "i principally consider simple 1-@xmath2 models , regarding extension to @xmath3 models where possible as a useful bonus .",
    "i do so by use of relative jacobi coordinates , noting that these map many relational quantum problems to problems whose formulation is known from the standard quantization of the absolutist formulation of nm .",
    "thus the first steps of the study of these simplest rpm models do _ not _ involve formal mathematical differences , permitting one to benefit from separation and special function techniques .",
    "thereby i can cover a wide range of rpm models for the minimally relationally - nontrivial case of 3 particles .",
    "these go well beyond bs s ( piecewise ) constant potentials in 1-d to additionally solve a number of interparticle harmonic oscillator and newton  coulomb potential problems including those presented in sec 7 .",
    "the first salient difference is interpretational .",
    "spreads are now in terms of relational quantities ( relative separations suffice in 1-d ) , from which perspective i show that objection bs1 is misplaced .",
    "the second is mathematical , but turns out not to spoil the above standard techniques by being treatable _",
    "after _ deploying these techniques .",
    "this involves the collective of subsystems having interlocked energy and counterbalancing am , and the subsystem eigenspectra sometimes exhibits truncations and gaps .",
    "these features are a further development of the mathematical observations which led to objection bs2 , but i also develop further what the implications of these are . for universes that have a large particle number and a diverse content ( such as free particles and of both positive- and negative - potential subsystems ) , gaps need no longer occur , truncations become acceptable , while interlocking and counterbalancing are obscured by the practicalities of experimentation involving only a small subsystem . as our own universe is large and diverse in content , the _ ` recovery of reality ' _ is thereby not compromised by bs2 .",
    "this opens the way for semiclassical exploration of these models , which i consider further , alongside the aforementioned consistent records formulation , in * ii*.78 . on the other hand , _ small universe models _",
    "do exhibit these interesting theoretical effects whereby they are useful toy models for understanding subtle ramifications that arise from considering _ closed_-universe quantum cosmologies .",
    "let @xmath4 be the nave @xmath5-dimensional configuration space in @xmath2 dimensions for @xmath0 particles whose positions are @xmath6 .",
    "jacobi actions are used , which implement temporal relationalism since they are _ reparametrization - invariant _ in the label - time @xmath7 .",
    "the actions considered in this article are for particle models whose kinetic term @xmath8 which is homogeneous quadratic in its constituent velocities .",
    "these take the form _ = 2 ,",
    "[ jac ] where @xmath9 is the potential term and @xmath10 is the total energy , taken to be a fixed constant ` energy of the universe ' @xmath11 .",
    "note that the more usual particle mechanics action , @xmath12 , can indeed be cast @xcite into the incipient jacobi form ( [ jac ] ) by adjoining the newtonian time @xmath13 to @xmath4 , then noting that @xmath14 alone features in the action and subsequently eliminating it by routhian reduction .",
    "the classical particle mechanics notion of spatial relationalism is implemented by passing to a suitable notion of arbitrary frame .",
    "this is achieved by the introduction of a translational auxiliary @xmath2-vector @xmath15 and whichever rotational auxiliary corresponds to @xmath2 : none for @xmath16 , a scalar b@xmath17 for @xmath18 or a 3-vector b@xmath19 for @xmath20 , so that the @xmath21th particle s position @xmath6 is replaced by & _ , q_a q_a -  _ - _ ^ _ q_a .",

    "i proceed by requiring the action to be built as best as possible out of objects that transform well under @xmath7-dependent eucl(@xmath2 ) . in particular , defining the _ nave _ or _",

    "@xmath26 is not a tensorial operation under @xmath7-dependent eucl(d ) transformations . as explained in @xcite , @xmath26",
    "should rather be seen as the lie derivative @xmath27 in a particular frame , which transforms to the lie derivative with respect to ` @xmath26 corrected additively by generators of translations and rotations . '",
    "this gives a kinetic term of the form ( _ i , _ j , , ) = _ a = 1^nm_a^ ( & _ , q_a ) ( & _ , q_a ) .",
    "[ t ] so , finally , the proposed action is @xmath28 of form ( [ jac ] ) with ( [ vrel ] ) and ( [ t ] ) substituted into it .",

    "these obey the primary quadratic constraint _ a = 1^n_p^ap^a + = .",
    "the secondary linear constraints , ^ _ a = 1^np^a = 0 [ zm ] and whichever portion of ^ _ a = 1^n ^ _ q_a p^a = 0 [ zam ] is relevant in the corresponding dimension , follow from variation of the cyclic auxiliary coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 . these constraints obey the poisson bracket algebra \\{p^ , p^ } = 0 , \\{p^ , } = 0 , \\ { , } = 0 , \\{p^ , l^ } = ^_p^ , \\{l^ , l^ } = ^_l _ , \\{l^ , } = 0 [ first6 ] for @xmath31 . as this",
    "is closed , there are no further constraints . the constraints ( [ zm ] , [ zam ] ) then signify that the physics is not on the doubly redundant configuration space @xmath32 but on the quotient space @xmath33 , thus indeed rendering absolute space irrelevant .",
    "it is worth counting to establish which are the minimal nontrivial dynamics examples .",
    "there are @xmath34 degrees of freedom in the @xmath2-dimensional nm of @xmath0 particles .",
    "there are @xmath2 translations and @xmath35 rotations which make up @xmath36 irrelevant motions .",
    "so the @xmath2-dimensional @xmath0-particle bb82 rpm has @xmath37 degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , one wants to express one change in terms of another change rather than in terms of an arbitrarily - reparametrizable label - time .",

    "i focus principally on the simplest nontrivial dynamics : @xmath40 .",

    "the question then arises whether bb82 rpm can _ also _ be cast as a presumably more complicated direct formulation of this kind , whereupon not even indirect or unphysical reference to absolute space is required .",
    "i address this below , partly foreshadowed by work of lynden - bell @xcite , gergely @xcite and jacobi .",
    "i use that the @xmath20 working contains everything under the provisos ( [ provisos ] ) . and then comment on each individual case @xmath42 as these differ significantly .",

    "thus the zero momentum constraint can be absorbed by passing to any such coordinate system , and this causes the absolute coordinates @xmath57 therein to drop out of all remaining equations , which thereby involve relative coordinates alone .",

    ", sufficiently accurate physical modelling of the universe acts to prevent arbitrarily distant subsystems from falling together in finite time : astrophysics with realistic matter will experience short - range forces interfering with the potential being arbitrarily negative or gr ( which respects a positive energy theorem ) will take over , while sr will bound infall velocities .",

    "while this goes against the poincar principle that barbour advocates , that at most positions and velocities should need to be specified in rpm , this principle might just be a simplicity ; for sure , @xmath71 is known to be much more complicated than @xmath1 by the work of dziobek @xcite and of poincar @xcite .",
    "finally , there are some robustness issues .",
    "can branches of physics external to particle mechanics be incorporated ?",
    "doing so would remove interference by external torques violating am conservation , and the possibility of absolute space or time being bestowed upon particle mechanics by other branches of physics .",

    "this is worth pointing out , since it means that , at least to start off with , one does _ not _ get the wrong sort of formal mathematics by quantizing absolute rather than relational particle mechanics .",
    "interpretational and mathematical differences appear later in the study .    for such potentials ,",
    "i demonstrate that passing to the relative jacobi coordinates @xmath96 often permits separation ( _ 1 , _ 2 ) = _ 1(_1 ) _",
    "2(_2 ) [ sepans ] . indeed",
    "the @xmath97 map i employ is _ form - preserving _ for many of these problems .",
    "i.e. it maps the 3@xmath2-dimensional configuration space quantum problem , for which the @xmath98 ( @xmath99 = 1 to 3 ) play the role of cartesian coordinates and that is separable into 3 standard @xmath2-dimensional problems for each @xmath98 , to a corresponding @xmath100-dimensional configuration space problem , for which @xmath63 ( @xmath101 = 1 to 2 ) play the role of cartesian configuration space coordinates and that is separable into 2 of the _ same kind _ of standard @xmath2-dimensional problems for each @xmath63 .",
    "the normalization of the 1-d models wavefunctions is then standard and not required for this article s applications .",
    "thus my strategy is to solve relational quantum problems by setting up @xmath97 maps to standard separable problems , and then exploiting the well - established mathematical machinery for these . only then do i consider , from a careful relationalist perspective , what the interpretation of the relational qm models is , and explore the new mathematics which comes upon considering these as whole systems / universes .",
    "the free problem straightforwardly separates to 2 copies of + _",
    "i_i = 0 , giving wavefunctions @xmath102 for a positive continuous spectrum .",
    "the solution of the relational problem may then be reassembled as _ = e^i ( - ) r_12/ e^i(m_1 + m_2)r_23/ .",
    "finally , the unusual relational feature is that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are not independent : @xmath105 .      for the single ho relational problem",
    "i exploit the following more widely applicable move 1 : as @xmath106 , any potential depending at most on @xmath107 is separable in @xmath96 coordinates , with identity map between the potential coefficients in @xmath54-space and @xmath63-space .",
    "thus -(_1 + _ 2)+ ( |_1| ) = -_1_1 + ( |_1|)_1 = _ 1_1 , -_2_2 + = _ 2_2 _ 1 + _ 2 = .",

    "ii*.    \\1 ) consider the spread ( i.e width ) of the wavefunctions [ this is essentially what bs do ] .",
    "\\2 ) furthermore investigate how localized wavepackets are as a whole ( as opposed to the spread of each wavefunction in their summand / integrand ) .",
    "\\3 ) consider what happens to the system for large quantum numbers whereupon the wavefunction becomes wiggly on scales much shorter than @xmath139 .",
    "\\4 ) consider a wkb ansatz for the wavefunction and expand in powers of @xmath140 .    * spread of the wavefunctions *    barbour and smolin s first objection bs1 was to the sensitivity of the spread of the wavefunctions of large - mass particles to the values of the mass of small - mass particles .",
    "this was in connection with piecewise - constant potential models with two small masses and one large one .",
    "i clarify why this is not a problem as follows .",
    "first , bear in mind that in the absolutist quantization , one thinks primarily of particle wavepackets , but in a 1-d relationalist quantization one should think of _ relative distance wavepackets_. then , intuitively , once one rephrases one s standard quantum intuition about small masses being more spread out in relational terms , it is clear that the position uncertainty of the small mass dominates the relational formulation s relative separation uncertainty between that small mass and a large mass ( fig 2 ) .    # 1#20.4#1    for two particles , position spread a ) versus relative separation spread b ) . for 3 particles in @xmath3 , c ) and d )",
    "are position spread versus a choice to represent relative spread in jacobi coordinates [ @xmath141 = arccos(@xmath142 ) ] .",
    "bs s specific example is akin to my example 1 , except that they have a constant @xmath143 and set @xmath144 while i have no @xmath143 but a constant @xmath11 .",
    "converting , the wavefunction may then be rewritten as = e^ i ( r_12 ( - ) + r_23 ( + ) ) / for @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and where the mass - independent constants present are parametrized by an angle @xmath141 .",
    "this has much nicer 1,3 symmetry than 1,2 symmetry , so in setting two of the masses to be equal to match bs s example , i opt for @xmath148 then the wavefunction goes as ~ e^ijr_12/e^ikr_23/ ( for @xmath66 , @xmath149 mass - independent constants ) .",
    "thus , indeed as bs claim , the small masses dominate all the uncertainties .",
    "but by my above interpretation , these uncertainties are actually in the separations between a big mass and a small mass , so this situation conforms to standard quantum intuitions rather than constituting an impasse .",
    "truly _ relevant test to establish whether there is a semiclassical limit problem is rather to check what happens if @xmath150 , for then there is a big mass  big mass relative separation , and it is _ this _ which one would not expect to be influenced much by a small mass somewhere else . and",
    "indeed , upon performing the new approximation , and isolating the big mass  big mass separation @xmath151 as the variable whose spread is of relevance , i find that ~ e^ i |j r_13/e^-i|kr_12/ ( for @xmath152 , @xmath153 mass - independent constants ) so that indeed only the big masses contribute significantly to the spread in the big mass - big mass separation .",
    "this basic conclusion is unaffected by having the two identical masses replaced by merely similar masses , and holds widely throughout the models presented in this paper when suitable pairs of quantities are set to be relatively large and small .",
    "* wavepackets *    consider the 1-@xmath2 problems which separate out of the relational problems of this section , piecemeal and as formal pieces of mathematics in which an eigenspectrum and wavefunctions are obtained from a differential equation and boundary conditions that depend on some abstract set of variables and parameters .",
    "then the wavepackets built up by summing and/or integrating the wavefunctions ( generally with some weighting ) over the eigenspectrum may also be considered as formal pieces of mathematics .",
    "my first point is that , at the level of the separated - out pieces of the relational problems considered in this section , this formal mathematics is the same as in the usual absolutist quantization .",
    "thus the piecemeal construction of wavepackets for the 1-d quantum problems does not care whether these arise from separation in relational problems or in absolutist ones , so both behave equally well .",
    "the best - known examples of these wavepackets are the fixed - size one for the free particle and the pulsating one for the harmonic oscillator ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a first difference between wavepackets in the absolutist and relational qm schemes arises in their interpretation .",
    "this parallels the above situation with the spreads .",
    "a second difference is that there are limitations building composite wavepackets in the relational case . unlike in the absolutist case , composition of subsystem wavepackets",
    "can not be extended to include the whole system .",
    "this is due to the energy of the universe being a fixed quantity .",
    "also note that the application of polar coordinates for @xmath3 brings out that the standard qm interpretation is close to being relational .",
    "this is most familiar in the study of the hydrogen atom , for which a simple standard approach is to treat the proton as fixed and then consider the spread of the radial separation @xmath154 between the proton ( or more accurately the atom s barycentre ) and the electron .",
    "all that is missing as regards obtaining a fully relational perspective is to consider the position of the barycentre not only to be uninteresting but also to be meaningless .",
    "then one considers the spread in @xmath155 .",
    "the ready availability of this familiar picture is one reason why it is unfortunate that bs restricted their study to 1-@xmath2 examples .",
    "i should add that interpreting @xmath3 rpm s furthermore requires an additional notion of _ spread in relative angle _ [ fig 2 d ) ] .",
    "* subsystem energy interlocking and truncation , gaps in the energy spectrum *    \\1 ) as mentioned above , there is energy interlocking between constituent subsystems .",
    "e.g. this requires the above navely free problem to have a line segment rather than a quadrant as its overall eigenspectrum , and the single ho and free particle system to have a set of points rather than an infinity of lines as its overall eigenspectrum , and the coupled ho s have a small set of points rather than a regular lattice as its eigenspectrum ( fig 3 ) .    # 1#20.4#1    effect on spectra of @xmath11 taking a forever fixed value .    by energy interlocking the small universe models",
    "built up from individual problems wavepackets additionally contain a delta function ( _ _ - ) acting inside the sums and integrals required to build it up , which causes it to differ mathematically from e.g the direct product of subsystem wavepackets in a fully separable universe .",
    "moreover , unlike in the usual interpretation of few - particle qm , the energy here is the energy of the universe , which is not only fixed , but is also a separate attribute of the universe so that the fixed value it takes need bear no relation to the eigenspectra of the universe s contents .",
    "this leads to the following effects .",
    "\\2 ) in my multiple ho example , all the energies [ @xmath156 and @xmath157 are positive . then @xmath158 so no wavefunctions exist .",
    "universes failing to meet the zero point energy of their content fail to have a wavefunction .",
    "\\3 ) such universes could rather fail to meet the energy required for just some of the states which lie above a given energy that is greater than the zero point energy .",
    "then one would obtain not the conventional eigenspectrum but rather a _",
    "truncation _ of it .",
    "\\4 ) in my 2 or 3 ho examples , one is required to solve @xmath159 for @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "then if @xmath132 and @xmath79 mismatch through some being rational and some irrational , or even if all are integers but the highest common factor of @xmath163 and @xmath164 does not divide @xmath79 , no solutions exist .",
    "this can also be set up to give _",
    "gaps _ in what would otherwise look like a truncation of the conventional eigenspectrum .",
    "similar effects can be achieved by more complicated matches and mismatches in the other examples @xmath133 dependences on @xmath111 .    *",
    "how energy interlocking does not affect the ` recovery of reality ' in practice for large universes *    objection bs2 is due to a less developed version of the above material .",
    "however , i develop the following conditional counterstatements .",
    "\\5 ) in universes which furthermore contain free particles , because these have continuous spectra , the missing out of some conventional states by 4 ) can not occur .",
    "this is the case e.g for the 1 ho example above , while ` tensoring ' free particles with the 2 or 3 ho setting above alleviates this ` missing state ' problem in the setting of a universe with a slightly larger particle number .",
    "\\6 ) if negative energies are possible , then subsystems can attain energies higher than @xmath11 .",
    "so if one tensors a negative potential example such as hydrogen with an independent ho pair , one can have less truncation of the ho .",
    "one will still have many , or all , states missing , depending on how the coefficients of the two independent subsystems potentials are related .",
    "but if one then tensors in free particles one can have everything up to the truncation .",
    "thus truncation can be displaced at least for some universes , by a modest increase in constituent particle number .",
    "it should be noted that there is a mismatch between e.g. the ho which has excited states unbounded from above in conventional qm and hydrogen which has negative energy states bounded from below .",
    "i get out of this difficulty by pointing out that in any case very high positive energy states are unlikely to be physically meaningful ; at the very least the physical validity of the model would break down due to e.g pair production and ultimately the breakdown of spacetime .",
    "to ensure one s model can attain high enough ( but finite ) positive energies , wells that are deep and/or numerous enough can be brought in .",
    "\\7 ) unlike 2)4 ) , energy interlocking _ does not _ go away with particle number increase or the accommodation of a variety of potentials within one s universe model .",
    "however , the large particle number and high quantum number aspects of semiclassicality are relevant here .",
    "subsystems remain well - behaved and all experimental studies in practice involve subsystems . but subsystems may be taken to have conventional wavepackets insofar as these _ are _ products of their constituent separated - out problems wavepackets .",
    "it is still true that these may be truncated rather than built out of arbitrarily many eigenfunctions along the lines of 1 ) to 3 ) above , but this will be alleviable in practice by ensuring that sufficient additional free particles or particles whose mutual potentials are of an opposing sign to the original subsystem s . in such a framework , the correlation of a quantity within a subsystem with another in the rest of the universe is overwhelmingly likely to evade detection provided that the rest of the universe contains plenty of other particles . and of course the real universe is indeed well - populated with particles .",
    "thus , bs s second bad semiclassicality objection should be replaced by : 14 ) lead to simple small relational particle universes constituting good toy models for gaining a deeper closed universes and of the problem of time , while 57 ) ensure that thinking of the ( diverse , large particle number ) real universe in terms of relational particles is _ not _ in practice compromised by any manifest bad semiclassicality .",
    "i should also caution that solving tise s is not as complete as setting up the full machinery of qm so more detailed contentions may emerge in further work .    whether the wkb ansatz may additionally be applied in to whole universes",
    "is an issue relevant to the semiclassical approach to quantum cosmology in the general ( rather than just rpm ) context .",
    "i touch on this issue in sec 8.3 , but mostly leave its discussion to * ii*.8 and @xcite . for the moment i show that increasing the dimension away from 1 reveals further such ` small closed universe ' effects .    *",
    "angular momentum counterbalancing *",
    "2-@xmath2 rpm solutions depend on 2 and not 4 quantum numbers via the am constraint as follows : @xmath165 @xmath166 arise in each separated problem , but these are ` joined together ' by @xmath167 , so @xmath168 .",

    "are _ transitions _ between these , most obviously manifested by spectra ( in the distinct , practical sense of emissive / absorptive frequency patterns ) or chemical reactions , possible ?",
    "after all , the universes in question are governed by tise s which possess solely stationary solutions ?",

    "subsystems _ to take on _ the appearance _ of dynamics .",
    "_ semiclassical approach _ which relies on the wkb ansatz and on ( perhaps small ) terms that cause nonseparability .",
    "one situation which has nonseparability is the multi - coulomb potential ( in some cases through multiple charged particles , while all models will have small gravitational interactions ) .",
    "consistent records schemes such as barbour s concern a different answer ( see * ii*.8 . for further comparison of these ) .",
    "that , while this discussion of apparent dynamics from tise s may appear unusual at first sight , it _ is _ a simplified discussion about the plausible situation that our own universe , which certainly possesses subsystems which appear to be dynamical , may ( at some level ) be describable _ overall _ by a gr tise : the so - called wheeler  dewitt equation ( see * ii * for references ) .",
    "it is subsequently relevant to ask about _ mechanism_. insisting on interpreting such models as closed ( i.e self - contained ) amounts to _ not _ assuming a ` surrounding photon sea ' .",
    "does the absense of this preclude all dynamical processes ?",
    "the answer is no , insofar that further particles of the same species can also mediate energy at some effective level ( this holds as far as fermi theory , overcoming the non - renormalizability of which leads to quantum electrodynamics , in which photons _ are _ then necessary for interactions ) . for atoms",
    ", it is well known that a grazing free particle can result in electron excitation , in ionization or in the ( 4-particle ) auger effect @xcite . if one must furthermore deploy a counterbalancing particle / subsystem in order to recover standard results , at least 4 or 5 body problems are required to model such situations .",
    "a separate point is that , while photon - free transitions as above are known , many _ more _ effects require interaction by photons or taking into account the atomic and fields .",
    "this is one reason why it would be interesting to extend the present work so as to ` build in ' electromagnetism by considering closed relational newton",

    "this would also serve both as a robustness check for the results of paper * ii * and as a toy model for closed einstein  maxwell universes .",
    "inclusion of intrinsic spin would also be useful .",
    "as regards the classical absolute versus relative motion debate , i have provided a concrete synthesis of directly - formulated relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) which is equivalent to a reformulation of the portion of newtonian mechanics that is conservative , has @xmath1 and whose kinetic term is homogeneous quadratic in its velocities .",
    "i have presented this in relative lagrange variables and in relative jacobi variables .",
    "i have furthermore presented improved ( counterbalancing subsystem ) arguments that adopting this portion or the straightforward nonhomogeneous enlargement of it is not for many purposes a major restriction at the classical level .",
    "as regards qm implications of adopting the relational stance , i have been able to go further than in previous relational studies by bringing in jacobi variables .",
    "thus i have been able to work with more complicated , more realistic and more relationally motivated quantum rpm models than barbour and smolin ( bs ) or any other paper in the rpm literature to date .",
    "this is based on how many simple problems are separable in jacobi coordinates and share much formal mathematical structure with the conventional absolutist approach .",
    "thus at the very simplest level , the answer to my question about whether absolutism has misled qm is _ no _ , in particular if one continues to adhere with conventional qm s emphasis ( see e.g. @xcite ) on formal structures and their manipulation .",
    "however , differences in the _ interpretation _ of that mathematics are readily manifest due to the one employing particle positions and the other employing interparticle ( cluster ) separations .",
    "indeed the bona fide relational interpretation that i provide enables me to reject bs s spread sensitivity objection to rpm models having a good semiclassical limit .",
    "moreover the answer is _ yes as regards whole closed universes_. the models of this paper exhibit several interesting features , which suffice to show that insisting on modelling a closed universe as a whole courts difficulties well beyond those encountered in studying its constituent subsystems .",
    "( of course , there is more to modelling quantum cosmology than just this . )",
    "these features are energy interlocking , am counterbalancing , eigenspectrum gaps due to the universe and its contents being mismatched , and eigenspectrum truncation due to finite resources .",
    "while these mathematical observations are an extension of bs s second objection to rpm models having a good semiclassical limit , moreover these effects do not affect the ` recovery of reality ' for a large universe with sufficiently varied contents . for , the presence of free particles and of potentials of both signs serve to overcome gaps and noticeable truncation , while the practicalities of experimentation involving only small subsystems means that interlocking and counterbalancing would be likely to go unnoticed .",

    "<S> this paper concerns the absolute versus relative motion debate . </S>",
    "<S> the barbour and bertotti 1982 work may be viewed as an indirectly set up relational formulation of a portion of newtonian mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> i consider further direct formulations of this and argue that the portion in question  universes with zero total angular momentum , that are conservative and with kinetic terms that are ( homogeneous ) quadratic in their velocities  is capable of accommodating a wide range of classical physics phenomena . furthermore , as i develop in paper * ii * , this relational particle model is a useful toy model for canonical general relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> i consider what happens if one quantizes relational rather than absolute mechanics , indeed whether the latter is misleading . by exploiting jacobi coordinates , i show how to access many examples of quantized relational particle models and then interpret these from a relational perspective . by these means , </S>",
    "<S> previous suggestions of bad semiclassicality for such models can be eluded . </S>",
    "<S> i show how small ( particle number ) universe relational particle model examples display eigenspectrum truncation , gaps , energy interlocking and counterbalanced total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> these features mean that these small universe models make interesting toy models for some aspects of closed universe quantum cosmology . while , these features do not compromise the recovery of reality as regards the practicalities of experimentation in a large universe such as our own .    </S>",
