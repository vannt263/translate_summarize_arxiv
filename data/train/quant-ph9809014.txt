    "within the modelization of many problems in mechanics , the potential is taken to be time - independent , and sets the stage for the ensuing particle dynamics .",
    "quite generally , however , the potential may have its own ( parametric ) dynamics : the stage is shifting beneath the actors feet , so to speak . in quasi - static problems",
    "this parametric dynamics will be on such slow time scales that it may be safely ignored ; or else , an adiabatic treatment may be used@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the time scale is of exceedingly rapid character , it may be easier to forget the potential altogether , and model the parametric variation through some fast degrees of freedom .",
    "the langevin equation represents a possible outcome of such a procedure@xcite .",
    "there may be situations where neither the quasi - static nor the langevin approaches is appropriate . in these cases ,",
    "one is obliged to face the time - dependence of the potential head - on  this leads to real analytic difficulties , especially in the quantum mechanical case , where one must abandon the notion of eigenstates , and tackle the time - dependent schrdinger equation directly .",
    "the analytic challenge of explicitly time - dependent mechanics is great , and exactly solvable cases are valuable for providing basic insights . the harmonic potential is widely studied in many areas of physics , due partly to its inherent solvability .",
    "it is also one of the most ubiquitous potentials in nature , due to the existence of near equilibrium states .",
    "it is for these reasons that the classical and quantum mechanics of the explicitly time - dependent harmonic potential have been studied for many years@xcite .",
    "one of the most extreme limits within this class of problems is that of the pulsed harmonic potential ( php ) .",
    "that is to say , the potential exists for extremely short instants , between which there is no potential whatsoever .",
    "this may be represented by @xmath0 where in particular @xmath1 and for regular pulsing @xmath2 .",
    "( an alternative terminology has arisen in the field of quantum chaos @xcite , in which one speaks of the system being ` kicked ' by such a potential . )",
    "apart from more obvious manifestations of such a potential ( in which an experimentalist externally pulses a system with some form of trapping potential ) , one can envisage such a situation arising in the frame of reference of a rapidly moving particle as it regularly passes through regions within which a static harmonic potential exists .    to our knowledge",
    "there is no complete treatment of this system .",
    "in fact , we suspect that its apparent simplicity may have persuaded workers to add complicating features .",
    "we are aware of similar harmonic models in the field of quantum chaos@xcite , but these are typically considered on a toroidal phase space in order to make closer contact to classically chaotic systems . in such a case , it is known that only periodic orbits exist in the quantum case , whereas the classical system may be chaotic depending on the curvature of the potential .",
    "we are content to study the system on the full phase space .",
    "also , a great deal of effort has been directed towards the problem of a ` kicked harmonic oscillator'@xcite , by which is meant a static harmonic potential periodically pulsed with some spatially periodic potential .",
    "this is used to model the behaviour of a trapped particle under the action of a laser .    to give a unifying flavour to the present work , we shall study three manifestations of the problem . in section ii we consider a classical particle in a php and parameterize the region of stability , along with its associated periodic and quasi - periodic dynamics . in sections iii - v we consider a quantum particle in a php .",
    "sections iii and iv are concerned with a wave packet centered at the origin , which has no classical analogue .",
    "two different analytic formulations of the problem are presented , each with their advantages in application .",
    "we parameterize the stability and periodicity of the dynamics ( including a bizarre cycle with period @xmath3 ) and also examine the limit of @xmath4 which we compare to the static harmonic potential . in section v we examine an off - centered wave packet .",
    "contact is made with the classical system via ehrenfest s theorem , and we also show that the expectation value of the hamiltonian splits neatly into two pieces which are , respectively , purely quantum and classical in origin . in section",
    "vi we study the third manifestation of a php ; namely a directed line in thermal equilibrium with a set of planar harmonic potentials .",
    "we determine the asymptotic transverse fluctuations of the line for binding potentials , and the finite maximal length of the line for unbinding potentials .",
    "we end the paper with section vii in which we give a detailed summary of our results , along with some general conclusions .",
    "we consider a classical particle of mass @xmath5 in a php , which is equivalent to the periodic impulsive force @xmath6 the particle will suffer a discontinuous change in momentum with a period of @xmath7 . in the intervening intervals ,",
    "the particle changes its position with a constant velocity .",
    "it is sufficient to describe the particle s trajectory by @xmath8 these quantities satisfy the difference equations : @xmath9 we must also specify the initial conditions for the particle : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the initial values for the difference equations may then be given as : @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the momentum to @xmath14 , so that the difference equations now take the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimensionless coupling to the potential .",
    "it is a simple matter to eliminate one set of the difference functions ( @xmath17 say ) , to give the single second - order difference equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "we supply the two required initial data @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "[ one may also proceed by recasting eq.([itxr ] ) in matrix form and determining the dynamics and stability of the system from the associated eigenvalues .",
    "we shall use the second - order difference equation in order to make closer contact with the analysis of the quantum system in the following section . ]",
    "this difference equation may be easily solved by introducing the generating function @xmath22 which may be inverted via the contour integral , @xmath23 where @xmath24 encircles the origin counterclockwise ( with a radius chosen small enough so as not to enclose any singularities bar the pole at the origin ) .",
    "summing the difference equation for @xmath25 with a weight of @xmath26 yields the following expression for the generating function : @xmath27 this function has two simple poles located at @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31 the poles lie on the real axis and one of them has a modulus less than unity . referring to eq.([invgenfn ] ) , we see this implies that @xmath32 grows unboundedly with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "thus , stable evolution of the particle is only possible for @xmath34 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) , which we now examine in more detail . defining a parameter @xmath36 via @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 .",
    "we evaluate the contour integral in eq.([invgenfn ] ) by noting that the contour @xmath24 may be deformed around the singularities away from the origin such that @xmath39 . in other words ,",
    "the required integral along @xmath24 is equal to minus the residues from the two poles . evaluating these residues , and performing some algebraic manipulations , we arrive at the result @xmath40 \\ .\\ ] ]",
    "it is clear from the above expression that some form of cyclic behaviour with period @xmath41 will occur when the value of @xmath42 ( and thus @xmath43 ) is adjusted so that @xmath44 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] , and consequently , @xmath47 . from eq.([itxr ] ) it is easy to check that such a value of @xmath36 also implies @xmath48 .",
    "let us classify two types of periodic motion : pmi(@xmath33 )  a motion for which all measurable quantities take on the same values with a period of @xmath49 ; and pmii(@xmath33 )  a motion for which only the energy of the system has a period of @xmath49 .",
    "now , the energy ( between pulses ) is simply given by @xmath50 thus , pmii(@xmath33 ) occurs for _ any _ value of @xmath36 satisfying @xmath44 .",
    "however , pmi(@xmath33 ) only occurs for values of @xmath36 which are an _ even _ multiple of @xmath51 .",
    "so the simplest pmii motion occurs for @xmath52 , which corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "however , the simplest pmi motion occurs for @xmath54 with @xmath55 , and corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "we stress that these periodic motions exist once the parameter @xmath42 is tuned to an appropriate value , regardless of the initial data @xmath57 .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that there exists one special pmi motion which has a period of @xmath58 .",
    "this may be seen directly from the first order difference equations ( [ itxr ] ) .",
    "such a motion is possible if one tunes @xmath59 _ and _ adjusts the initial data such that @xmath60 .",
    "in this and the next two sections we shall examine the evolution of a gaussian wave - packet under the influence of a php .",
    "we shall highlight the similarities of the mean motion to the classical dynamics described in section ii , as well as some subtle effects which are of a purely quantum origin . in this section",

    "we study the same problem , but with the aid of fourier decomposition .",
    "both methods yield the same results , but in surprisingly different formats , which are individually suited to the calculation of different quantities .",
    "the final section of the three is concerned with the evolution of an off - centered wave - packet ( which has non - zero expectation values for position and momentum and may therefore be compared to the classical case ) .",

    "this choice is made on the grounds of simplicity , but we can imagine preparing such a state from the lowest eigenstate of a static harmonic potential . the evolution of the wave function between pulses is simply free particle propagation .",

    "the iteration rule ( [ iterpsi2 ] ) clearly shows that the wave function will have a gaussian form for all times , given that its initial form is chosen to be a gaussian .",

    "we refer the reader to figs.1 - 5 for the classical ( with typical values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and quantum ( with varying initial parameter @xmath135 ) portraits . despite the similarity in the values of @xmath136",
    "at which the periodic orbits occur , we see a distinct difference in the bounding curves @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the minumum and maximum energies . in the classical case , @xmath139 is essentially zero and @xmath140 is a monotonically increasing function of the coupling @xmath42 . in the quantum case , @xmath139 maintains a distinct gap from zero , and the difference @xmath141 is non - monotonic with @xmath42 .",
    "it would be of interest to determine the analytic properties of these bounding curves , but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we shall make a more physical connection between the quantum and classical motions in section v when we consider an off - centered wave function which allows the particle to maintain non - zero expectation values of both position and momentum .",
    "first however , we present an alternative treatment of the centered gaussian wave function , which will allow us to study some other properties of this system more easily .",
    "although the calculations of the previous section were reasonably straightforward , they still required the evaluation of cumbersome @xmath33-fold gaussian integrals .",
    "it might be hoped that a simpler derivation of the results is possible , since the wave function evolves by free wave propagation between pulses , which may be handled more easily in fourier space .",
    "the purpose of this section is to derive an iteration rule for the wave function using this fourier method .",
    "the surprise is that the rule ( or difference equation ) turns out to be non - linear and of first order , in contrast to the linear second order rule ( [ diffqn ] ) derived above .",
    "the two iteration rules must yield the same results of course ; but , as we shall see , they are non - trivially related .",

    "we have @xmath151    given this non - linear iteration rule , one might expect the system to have some kind of non - trivial ( chaotic ) dynamics .",
    "however , with the benefit of hindsight , we know from section iii that in fact the system has either periodic or quasi - periodic behaviour ( in the stable regime @xmath35 ) .",
    "this simpler behaviour is not apparent from the non - linear rule for @xmath152 , but we can prove it is the case by connecting this rule to the linear second order rule for @xmath153 given in eq.([diffqn ] ) .",

    "the relation ( [ relqsig ] ) would be seen as a rather remarkable linearizing transformation . in order to probe the general ( quasi)-periodic behaviour of this system ,",
    "the linear iteration rule is the description of choice .",
    "however , there are two other aspects of this system which are much more easily described by the non - linear rule given above .",
    "the first of these is the existence of a special periodic motion with period @xmath3 .",
    "we may identify this by simply demanding that @xmath155 in eq.([nonlinit ] ) .",

    "so this special ` 1-cycle ' is only possible ( for a given value of @xmath158 $ ] ) for a special value @xmath159 of the parameter @xmath135 ( which , we remind the reader , describes the initial gaussian wave function ) .",

    "an example of this 1-cycle is shown in fig .",
    "5 . this 1-cycle is a purely quantum effect , since the classical system can only have cycles of period @xmath162 for obvious reasons .",
    "one might term this motion ` the sound of one hand clapping . '",
    "the second aspect of the quantum system which may be extracted more easily from the non - linear iteration is the behaviour of the system as the time between pulses is taken to zero . before taking this limit ,",
    "it is important to scale out @xmath3 in other quantities .",
    "now , we shall compare the system ( in the limit of @xmath4 ) , to the quantum mechanics of the static harmonic potential . for the latter system ,",
    "the potential is taken to be @xmath163 .",

    "referring to eq.([expp ] ) , the second term on the right - hand - side is determined as nothing more than the classical energy @xmath209 studied in section ii .",
    "thus , the energy of the off - centered gaussian falls neatly into two separate pieces : a ` classical ' energy determined purely by the expectation value of the momentum , and a ` quantum ' energy determined purely by the internal fluctuations of the wave packet in the co - moving frame .",
    "this ends the study of a quantum particle in a php .",
    "quantum mechanical green functions may be rewritten as path integrals .",
    "it is within this formalism that one may appreciate the close mathematical connection between quantum processes and the statistical mechanics of directed lines .",
    "we shall use this connection to discuss the physics of a directed line in thermal equilibrium with a php , which is physically realized by a set of static , planar ( or sparse@xcite ) , harmonic potentials .",
    "we begin by writing the feynman path integral@xcite for the green function of a quantum mechanical particle in a potential @xmath210 ( where we restrict our attention to one dimension for simplicity ) : @xmath211 \\right \\rbrace \\ .\\ ] ] this is to be compared with the ( restricted ) partition function for a directed line in thermal equilibrium with a static potential @xmath212 . by ` directed line ' we mean a connected path in a two dimensional space ( x , z ) , which may adopt any configuration whatever , so long as it is directed along the longitudinal ( @xmath213 ) direction .",
    "the statistical mechanics of such objects is of interest in several fields , including directed polymers@xcite , and superconducting flux lines@xcite .",
    "the partition function for a line with one end pinned at @xmath214 and the other pinned at @xmath215 is given by @xmath216 \\right \\rbrace \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath217 is temperature ( with boltzmann s constant set to unity ) and @xmath218 is the elasticity of the line .",
    "the obvious similarity between these two path integrals can be misleading , since it is important to remember that the relation between them exists at a strictly mathematical level .",
    "given the analytic solution to one path integral , one may infer the solution to the other by an analytic continuation from ` real time ' @xmath219 to ` imaginary time ' @xmath213 .",
    "the physical properties of the two systems are generally quite distinct and little may be inferred about the physics of one of the systems , if only qualitative information about the physics of the other is available .",
    "this will become clear in the present case of a php , as we shall soon see .",
    "the physical meaning of a directed line in equilibrium with a php is as follows .",
    "the php itself consists of potentials which only exist on discrete transverse lines , and are regularly spaced along the longitudinal axis .",
    "these potentials are harmonic and centered at @xmath220 .",
    "the directed line ( which we shall take to be pinned at @xmath221 and to have a length @xmath213 ) equilibrates itself in these potentials , meaning that the free energy is minimized as a result of the competition between the wandering of the line ( entropy ) , and its elastic and potential energies .",
    "one may find an application within the field of superconductivity . in an array of flux lines ,",
    "one may construct an approximate ( harmonic ) ` caging ' potential for a given flux line , by averaging over the repulsive line - line interactions which it experiences with its neighbours .",
    "furthermore , in the strongly layered cuprates@xcite ( which form the most important class of high temperature superconductors ) the supercurrents only exist in well separated cu - o planes . thus the flux line ( meaning the imaginary line connecting the planar centres of magnetic flux ) will only experience the caging potential in discrete , but regular , transverse planes .",
    "given the relationship between the quantum system and the directed line at the level of path integrals , there is naturally a partial differential equation for @xmath222 corresponding to the schrdinger equation .",
    "defining a ` rigidity ' @xmath223 , and absorbing @xmath217 into the potential , we have    @xmath224    the potential is taken to be a php , expressed as @xmath225 the initial condition implicit in the path integral ( [ dirppi ] ) is @xmath226 , but we may generalize this to any desired function . following our earlier work on the quantum system , we shall take a gaussian initial condition @xmath227 \\ , \\ ] ] which would naturally arise from thermal wandering of a directed line from a @xmath228-function initial condition .",
    "the normalization of @xmath222 deserves mention .",
    "whereas in the quantum system , the wave function @xmath179 is normalized by requiring that @xmath229 , the partition function has an arbitrary prefactor , as we only require that @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is the probability density of the line .",
    "we shall not enter into any details concerning the analysis of this system , as our results may be easily reconstructed from the methods presented in section iii for the quantum analogue .",
    "the present system is described by two dimensionless parameters : an effective coupling @xmath232 and the ratio @xmath233 which is the square of the ratio of the transverse thermal wandering scale @xmath234 and the initial transverse scale @xmath235 .",
    "the probability density of the line just prior to the @xmath190 impulse is defined as @xmath236 and has the explicit form @xmath237 ^{1/2 } \\exp \\left [ - \\left ( { q_{n } - q_{n-1 } \\over q_{n } }   \\right ) \\left ( { x \\over l } \\right ) ^{2 } \\right ] \\ .\\ ] ] this gaussian form is completely described by one quantity ; namely , the width @xmath115 of the probability density defined via @xmath238 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath239 the determinants @xmath106 satisfy the second order difference equation @xmath240 where @xmath241 , and the initial data are @xmath120 and @xmath242 .",
    "let us first study the case of @xmath243 , which corresponds to an attractive ( or binding ) php with @xmath244 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to define a parameter @xmath245 via @xmath246 then we find @xmath247 \\ .\\ ] ] substituting this solution into eq.([widthdp ] ) yields the final result for the transverse line scale as a function of @xmath248 : @xmath249^{1/2 } \\ .\\ ] ]    for the limit of an infinitely long line , @xmath250 , the function @xmath251 , and the above result simplifies dramatically to @xmath252 with finite @xmath33 corrections @xmath253 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath254 is given by @xmath255 note that for @xmath256 the transverse scale is asymptotically equal to the initial scale @xmath235 , meaning that a specially tuned php can exactly compensate the transverse wandering for arbitrarily long lines .",
    "the tuned value of the coupling @xmath257 needed to satisfy eq.([zetah ] ) is @xmath258 since the coupling @xmath257 must be positive , we see that such a compensating php is only possible for @xmath259 , _",
    "i.e. _ for a line whose initial scale @xmath260 .",
    "this is clear since whatever the php strength , the line is free to wander a transverse scale @xmath261 between pulses , and thus we can never restrict the line to @xmath262 if @xmath263 .",
    "regardless of the initial transverse scale @xmath235 , a very strong php is expected to strongly compress the line to have a scale @xmath264 . for @xmath265 , one can perform an asymptotic expansion on eq.([wsoldp2 ] ) to find @xmath266    the case of a repulsive ( or unbinding ) php is a little more subtle as the line will become unstable ( meaning the probability density becomes unnormalizable ) beyond a critical length depending on the strength of the potential .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that for the line to survive just one pulse , we require @xmath267 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define a parameter @xmath268 via @xmath269 we find for the determinants @xmath270 \\ , \\ ] ] and using eq.([widthdp ] ) , @xmath271^{1/2 } \\ .\\ ] ] this expression is not valid for arbitrarily large @xmath33 .",
    "there exists a maximum length @xmath272 for the directed line , beyond which it no longer exists as a connected elastic structure .",
    "the value @xmath273 may be found by demanding that @xmath274 for all @xmath275 . referring to eq.([detdp ] )",
    "we find that @xmath276 $ ] , where @xmath277 \\ .\\ ] ] for @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 as expected .",
    "the more interesting limit of @xmath281 yields the result @xmath282 the transverse scale of the density may also be studied in the limit of small @xmath283 . referring to eq.([whsoldp ] ) we find @xmath284 for @xmath285 , which is pure thermal wandering . as @xmath33 increases further , the potential starts to have an effect , and for @xmath286 , we find that the transverse scale increases linearly with line length @xmath287 , with a prefactor depending in a non - trivial way on @xmath288 .",
    "in this paper we have studied in detail the action of a pulsed harmonic potential on three systems : a classical particle , a quantum particle , and a directed line .",
    "the first and second systems share some properties via their mechanics , whereas the second and third share a common mathematical basis via the path integral formalism .",
    "the pulsing was taken to be regular with a period @xmath3 ( or a longitudinal wavelength @xmath289 in the case of a directed line ) .",
    "the classical particle was studied in section ii . it was found to have stable ( or bounded ) dynamics as long as the dimensionless coupling @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "eq.([dimcoup ] ) ) lies in the range @xmath35 .",
    "otherwise the motion is unstable . for @xmath290 ,",
    "the particle is accelerated to @xmath291 , whilst for @xmath292 , the particle ` ping - pongs ' with ever increasing amplitude away from the origin . in the stable band , there is either periodic or quasi - periodic motion .",
    "we introduced two classes of periodic motion : pmi(@xmath33 ) , for motion where all physical quantities have period @xmath41 ; and pmii(@xmath33 ) , for motion where the energy has period @xmath41 .",
    "we found that the condition for pmi(@xmath33 ) motion was that @xmath45 where @xmath36 is a convenient parameter defined as @xmath293 , and @xmath131 is a positive _ even _",
    "integer satisfying @xmath294 $ ] .",
    "thus the simplest pmi motion occurs for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( corresponding to @xmath295 ) .",
    "pmii(@xmath33 ) motion was found to occur for @xmath296 with @xmath297 an integer ( even or odd ) in the range @xmath298 $ ] .",
    "the simplest pmii motion occurs for @xmath52 and @xmath299 ( corresponding to @xmath300 ) .",
    "these periodic motions are independent of the initial position @xmath301 and initial momentum @xmath302 .",
    "we also found one special pmi(2 ) motion which requires @xmath303 and a specially tuned initial condition @xmath304 .",
    "the dynamical properties of a quantum particle in a php were studied in sections iii - v .",
    "the first two sections concentrated on a gaussian wave packet centered at the origin ; whilst section v pertained to the case of an off - centered gaussian wave packet , which has non - zero expectation values of position and momentum , and may therefore be compared directly to the classical particle studied in section ii .    in section",
    "iii we studied the centered gaussian wave packet in a php using the iteration properties of the determinants of @xmath33-fold gaussian integrals .",
    "this led to second order linear iteration rules similar to those found in section ii .",
    "the stability band for the wave packet is @xmath305 as in the classical case .",
    "if @xmath290 , the wave packet is stretched more with each pulse and the width monotonically diverges with time .",
    "if @xmath306 , the wave packet is squeezed so tightly after each pulse that the velocity of expansion of the width of the packet grows ever greater after each pulse ( due to quantum uncertainty ) . within the stable band , there are periodic and quasi - periodic dynamics . in the former ,",
    "the cycles are periodic for all physical properties , thus there is no classification into pmi and pmii as in the classical case .",
    "the condition for a cycle of period @xmath41 is @xmath45 with @xmath131 an integer ( even or odd ) in the range @xmath307 $ ] , where @xmath36 is defined via @xmath293 as used in the classical case .",
    "the energy portraits for the classical and quantum particles are shown in figs . 1 and 2 , and show several distinct features , especially with regard to the upper and lower bounding curves .    in section iv we analysed the centered gaussian wave packet using fourier methods , which resulted in a first - order , but nonlinear , iteration rule .",
    "we showed its equivalence to the second - order linear iteration rule of section iii .",
    "this first order rule allowed two new aspects of the problem to be analysed with ease .",
    "the first is the existence of a special cycle of period @xmath3 , which is a purely quantum mechanical effect , as a classical system must have a cycle of at least @xmath58 .",
    "this 1-cycle exists only for an initial complex gaussian wave function with an inverse variance tuned to the harmonic coupling via @xmath308 .",
    "an example of a 1-cycle is shown in fig .",
    "the second aspect is the behaviour of the system as the time @xmath3 between pulses is taken to zero .",
    "we found that if the initial wave function is chosen to be the ground state of a static harmonic potential ( with oscillator frequency @xmath309 ) , then this wave function is a fixed point of the php dynamics as @xmath4 .",
    "this result shows that a pulsed potential with arbitrarily small period can not mimic a static potential , for even though the ground state wave function is a fixed point of the php dynamics , there is no phase evolution as would be found for a wave function in the static potential .",
    "the php continually resets the phase clock .",
    "this causes concern with regard to numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , where one may discretize time , in which case one is implicitly modelling a static potential by a pulsed potential .    in section",
    "v we allowed the gaussian wave packet to be off - centre , which allowed there to be an evolution of the expectation values @xmath310 and @xmath311 of the position and momentum respectively .",
    "using our previous iteration rules in tandem , we showed that these expectation values obeyed the same difference equations as the classical position and momentum , as studied in section ii , thus verifying ehrenfest s theorem in a non - trivial setting .",
    "furthermore , we evaluated the energy of the wave packet , and found that it split neatly into two pieces : a ` quantum piece ' equal to the energy of the centered gaussian wave packet , and a ` classical piece ' equal to @xmath312 .",
    "we moved away from the quantum php , and in section vi studied the statistical mechanics of a directed line in a harmonic potential which exists only on discrete transverse lines which are regularly spaced in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this system is the imaginary time analogue of the quantum system , as is clear from the path integral formalism . using the same methods as in section iii",
    ", we found that this system has two qualitatively different regimes , depending on the dimensionless coupling @xmath257 ( which is the analogous quantity to @xmath42 as used in the mechanical systems ) .",
    "for @xmath244 , we found that the transverse fluctuations of the line saturate rapidly to @xmath313 , where @xmath261 is the transverse thermal wandering scale between pulses , and @xmath314 , where @xmath315 .",
    "for very large attractive coupling , the transverse scale saturates at @xmath261 with @xmath316 corrections . for @xmath317",
    "the line has a maximum length @xmath318 beyond which it is destroyed ( as a connected elastic entity ) by the repulsive php .",
    "an exact expression was derived for @xmath273 ( as given in eq.([upperlen ] ) ) , which has the asymptotic form for @xmath281 : @xmath276 $ ] , with @xmath319 .",
    "prior to the line breaking up , the transverse wandering grows diffusively for @xmath320 , and linearly with @xmath33 for @xmath321 .",
    "these results show clearly the subtle differences which exist between the mechanics of the classical and quantum particles in a php ; and also the differences which exist between the statistics of the quantum and statistical path integrals expressions for the php . in the former case",
    "we have seen that the quantum system has another level of complexity beyond the mean ( or classical ) motion .",
    "the periodic motion of the centered gaussian wave function has no classical counterpart , and its energy portrait certainly deserves more study . in the latter case of the quantum versus statistical path integrals ,",
    "we have seen how no vestige of the periodic behaviour of the quantum system remains in the physics of the directed line .",
    "it has a much simpler asymptotic ( @xmath322 ) behaviour , since all the interesting quantum effects are here damped exponentially in @xmath33 .",
    "this serves as a warning that one can only retrieve complete quantum information from an imaginary time path integral , if one has complete analytic information .",
    "we believe that these results may also be of some practical interest .",
    "it is well known how to trap single particles in specially prepared potentials formed from external magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "thus it is possible to make the trapping potential time dependent by externally varying these fields .",
    "it would be of interest to use such external variation to mimic a php , and to test the generality of the results obtained here ; namely , the stability band , and its associated periodic and quasi - periodic dynamics .    as detailed in section vi",
    ", one can find applications for the directed line in a php in the field of superconductivity .",
    "of more recent interest in this field is the role of disorder in layered materials@xcite , and its efficacy in pinning flux lines .",
    "disorder is a notoriously difficult effect to describe analytically , and there are essentially no analytically solvable cases of directed lines in a quenched disorder potential .",
    "we consider the generalization of the regularly pulsed php to one with random pulsing intervals ( along with a localized columnar pin ) to be a prime candidate for such a solvable system , using the framework developed in this paper ."
