    "in a recent paper ( king et al , 1996 ; hereafter paper 1 ) we considered the disc instability model for soft x ",
    "ray transients ( sxts ) . following van paradijs ( 1996 )",
    "we noted that x  ray irradiation of the disc surface tends to suppress the instability , so that sxt behaviour requires that the mass transfer rate is below a critical limit which is itself a rising function of orbital period @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    "d mass transfer is driven by the nuclear expansion of an evolved secondary , and proceeds at low enough rates that almost all of these systems appear as sxts . for @xmath15 d",
    "mass transfer is driven by angular momentum losses ; in paper 1 we showed that the resulting rates are higher than the critical rate , hence too high for sxt behaviour unless the secondary star is already somewhat nuclear  evolved before mass transfer begins .",
    "this effect is particularly marked in a neutron ",
    "star low  mass x - ray binary ( neutron  star lmxb , or nlmxb ) : if we write ( cf paper 1 ) @xmath16 for the ratio of the secondary s mass to that of a zams star filling the roche lobe at the same orbital period , sxt behaviour requires @xmath17 .",
    "by contrast we found a much weaker limit @xmath18 for sxt behaviour in a lmxb with a @xmath19 black  hole primary .",
    "these limits agree with the extreme mass ratios always found in sxts . in paper 1",
    "we suggested that these limits also offered a potential explanation for the prevalence of black  hole systems among sxts ( 8 out of 14 with known @xmath13 ) as compared with persistent lmxbs ( 1 out of 29 with known @xmath13 ) .",
    "as nlmxbs can be reliably identified by the presence of x  ray bursts , we consider this problem further by investigating constraints on nlmxb formation .",
    "the requirement that short  period sxt secondaries should be significantly evolved is a powerful clue in investigating lmxb ( and particularly nlmxb ) formation . for example , the very fact that at least 4 nlmxbs out of 22 in the relevant period range are transients ( 0748 - 676 , cen x-4 , 1658 - 298 , aql x-1 ; cf .",
    "van  paradijs 1995 ) must imply that nlmxb secondaries usually have masses @xmath20 at the onset of mass transfer .",
    "lower initial ",
    "mass secondaries would be essentially unevolved when mass transfer began , and a large population of them would require the 4 known sxts among nlmxbs to be accompanied by a far greater number of persistent nlmxbs than observed .",
    "however to get any nlmxbs at all at @xmath15  d simultaneously requires that some of the secondaries initially have masses @xmath21 so that angular momentum loss via magnetic braking can shrink the binary .",
    "in addition , for @xmath22 these nmlxbs with a main  sequence donor will be unstable to thermal  timescale mass transfer once contact is reached ; they transfer mass at super  eddington rates and do not appear as nlmxbs ( kalogera & webbink 1996a ) . given these restrictions",
    "all nlmxbs with @xmath15 d ( and indeed most at longer periods too ) must apparently form with @xmath5 in a very restricted range @xmath23 .    the properties and the very existence of this group depend sensitively on the efficiency of magnetic braking .",
    "the paper by iben et al .",
    "( 1995b ) on general lmxb formation effectively rules out these systems because it assumes that magnetic braking does not operate for @xmath24 .",
    "similarly terman et al .  (",
    "1996 ) do not consider them in detail as they somewhat artificially assume that @xmath25 separates systems captured by angular momentum losses from systems evolving towards longer orbital period .",
    "below we investigate in detail constraints on nlmxbs forming after a common envelope ( ce ) phase and subsequent helium star supernova ( sn ) .",
    "we consider first the fundamental case of a spherically symmetrical sn ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) , and we shall show that in this case secondary stars in nlmxbs are indeed significantly nuclear",
    " evolved at the onset of mass transfer . a generalization to the more realistic case when the neutron star receives a kick velocity during the sn ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) reveals that the fraction of systems with unevolved secondaries increases with increasing magnitude of the kick . for a given magnetic braking strength this places limits on the magnitude of the kick velocity .",
    "possible alternative evolutionary channels leading to nlmxb formation are discussed in sect .",
    "2.3 .      to discover any limits on the initial mass @xmath5 of the secondary we consider the constraints on the formation of lmxbs from helium  star + main  sequence ( ms ) binary remnants of common envelope evolution in the case of a spherically symmetrical sn .",
    "webbink & kalogera ( 1994 ; hereafter wk ) and kalogera & webbink ( 1996a ) list a number of requirements that the various progenitor stages must satisfy in order to lead to lmxb formation . of these , three turn out to be crucial in fixing @xmath5 :    \\(a ) the post  common ",
    "envelope binary must be wide enough to allow the helium star to evolve to core collapse ( requirement 6 of wk ) .",
    "\\(b ) the binary must survive the supernova event resulting from the core collapse of the helium star ( 7 of wk ) .",
    "\\(c ) after the helium star progenitor of the lmxb primary explodes as a supernova the binary must be able to reach interaction within the age of the galaxy ( wk 8) .",
    "if @xmath5 is large enough and the post  sn separation is wide enough ( c ) will occur through the nuclear expansion of the secondary .",
    "such systems require @xmath20 to give main  sequence lifetimes @xmath26 less than the age @xmath27 of the galaxy and must have @xmath14 d at the onset of mass transfer ; @xmath13 will increase further as the secondary expands .",
    "however if @xmath5 is less than this and/or the post - sn binary is narrower , ( c ) can come about through orbital angular momentum loss . after reaching contact with an initial orbital period of",
    "order 1  2 d , such systems evolve either to longer ( @xmath28 d ) or shorter ( @xmath29 d ) periods depending on the competition between nuclear evolution and angular momentum loss ( pylyser & savonije 1988a , b ) .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we concentrate on this latter group of systems , which are the only ones which can populate the short  period ( @xmath15 d ) region .",
    "it is convenient to apply the constraints ( a  c ) in a different order . from ( c )",
    "we require @xmath30 , where @xmath31\\ { \\rm yr } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] @xmath32\\ { \\rm yr } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] are the timescales for detached orbital evolution under magnetic braking and gravitational radiation , with @xmath33 a dimensionless efficiency parameter for the former case .",
    "these shrink the post ",
    "sn binary from its initial period @xmath13 to the value @xmath34 at which it first comes into contact with its roche lobe ( @xmath35 etc ) .",
    "if the secondary is unevolved an adequate approximation for @xmath34 is @xmath36 , while @xmath34 is up to an factor @xmath37 larger if the secondary is fairly massive ( @xmath38 ) and close to the terminal main  sequence .",
    "we assume that the secondary has a structure such that a magnetic stellar wind brakes its rotation ; since we are considering short  period lmxbs in which the secondaries are not too far from the main sequence this requires @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore we assume that the secondary is tidally locked to the orbit such that magnetic braking removes orbital ( rather than only rotational ) angular momentum . applying simple scalings for the tidal synchronization timescale ( e.g.  tassoul 1995 )",
    "suggests that this is the case for the detached systems in the period range under consideration ( see below ) .",
    "the efficiency parameter @xmath33 in ( [ eq1 ] ) allows us to test the sensitivity of our results to the strength of magnetic braking .",
    "the standard case @xmath40 corresponds to the description by verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) when the radius of gyration is set to @xmath41 and the calibration parameter to unity .",
    "requirement ( c ) thus gives the longest post  sn period compatible with short  period lmxb formation .",
    "it is easy to show that the longest possible value of this period is given by equating @xmath42 to @xmath27 with @xmath43 , so that the term in square brackets in ( [ eq1 ] ) is unity .",
    "kepler s law now gives a condition on the separation @xmath44 of the tidally ",
    "circularized post ",
    "sn binary , i.e. @xmath45}^{1/5 } ,    \\label{eq20}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .    before exploiting ( [ eq20 ] )",
    "further we apply requirement ( b ) . in a spherically symmetrical supernova explosion",
    ", it is well known that the remnant binary is disrupted if more than one  half of the binary mass is removed , i.e. unless @xmath47 or @xmath48 the binary will be disrupted .",
    "here @xmath49 is the helium star mass @xmath50 in @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the eccentricity @xmath52 of the orbit immediately after the sn is given by @xmath53 obviously condition ( [ eq8 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "the pre  sn separation and the post  sn separation of the tidally circularized orbit are related by ( e.g.  verbunt 1993 ) @xmath55    using ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) we find that the pre ",

    "sn binary separation    finally , requirement ( a ) demands that the largest radius @xmath58 of the helium star must fit inside the pre ",
    "sn binary .",
    "the evolution of the helium star is very rapid compared with the orbital evolution so we assume that @xmath59 is constant , and the condition is @xmath60 .",
    "( if this condition fails it is possible that some lmxbs nevertheless form after a second common  envelope phase , cf iben et al 1995b .",
    "we note , however , that these authors assume an unusually efficient envelope ejection compared to the standard common envelope description ( [ eq17 ] ) below .",
    "application of the latter would almost always lead to a merger .",
    "hence we neglect this group of systems . )",
    "iben et al .",
    "( 1995b ) fit @xmath58 as @xmath61 for @xmath62 .    hence combining ( [ eq5 ] ) with ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "we see that ( a ) and ( c ) demand @xmath63 thereby defining a lower limit for @xmath64 for given @xmath65 , @xmath49 ( or a lower limit for @xmath49 for given @xmath65 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "observational evidence strongly suggests that neutron stars emerge from the supernova that creates them with a mass @xmath66 .",
    "figure 1 shows the constraints ( [ eq8 ] , [ eq6 ] ) for this mass , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . ( for @xmath69 , where magnetic braking is thought not to operate , ( [ eq6 ] ) was replaced by the corresponding constraint using @xmath70 instead of @xmath42 . ) as can be seen the two constraints cross at a value @xmath71 .",
    "hence @xmath72 for nlmxb formation through this channel .",
    "we now go one step further and ask under what conditions the binary can begin mass transfer with a secondary which has spent less than a fraction @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) of its lifetime @xmath26 on the main sequence , i.e. with @xmath75 clearly this is a more stringent requirement than ( c ) , where the rhs is @xmath76 , and it therefore requires a larger mass @xmath64 .",
    "taking @xmath77 and following the same line of reasoning that led to the constraint ( [ eq6 ] ) , i.e.  replacing @xmath78 in ( [ eq6 ] ) by @xmath79 , we find @xmath80 which must hold simultaneously with ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "condition ( [ eq12 ] ) is best understood as a _ lower _",
    "limit for the he star mass for any given @xmath65 , @xmath64 . in fig .  1 we show the constraint for @xmath81 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath82 ( dash - dotted ) , with standard magnetic braking ( @xmath68 ) . instead of the rough approximation ( [ eq10 ] )",
    "we used the fitting formulae given by kalogera & webbink ( 1996a ) to determine @xmath26 .",
    "we see that condition ( [ eq12 ] ) with @xmath81 intersects the allowed mass range @xmath83 set by the galactic age constraint and the requirement of thermally stable mass transfer respectively .",
    "systems with @xmath83 to the left of the dotted line in fig .  1 ( hatched , wide spacing ) turn  on mass transfer with a giant donor at long orbital period ( @xmath14 d ) . as in most of them mass",
    "transfer is unstable ( e.g.  kalogera & webbink 1996a ) they would probably not appear as long  period nlmxbs ; we do not consider this group further .",
    "systems with @xmath84 to the right of this line ( hatched , narrow spacing ) will evolve to short orbital periods .",
    "the location of the dash  dotted line in fig .",
    "1 clearly demonstrates that all secondaries of systems in this group are somewhat evolved . in other words : in the limit of negligible kick velocities secondaries in a large fraction of nlmxbs with @xmath15 d are close to the end of their ms lifetimes and are partially nuclear  evolved ( @xmath85 ) when mass transfer starts .",
    "the resulting low mass transfer rates ( pylyser & savonije 1988b ) then probably explain why a comparatively large fraction of nlmxbs of both types appear as transients .",
    "the simple scalings of paper 1 suggest that sxt behaviour requires @xmath17 ; full population synthesis calculations are needed in order to quantify the resulting sxt fraction .",
    "we note that kalogera & webbink ( 1996b ) find that short  period lmxbs do not form at all without kick velocities .",
    "the reason for this difference from our conclusions is a modification of the standard form ( [ eq1 ] ) of magnetic braking such that @xmath42 varies like @xmath86 ( rather than @xmath87 ) , and the introduction of a reduction factor for secondaries more massive than @xmath88 .",
    "even if the reduction factor is ignored ( which is @xmath89 for @xmath90 ) , their @xmath42 is still longer by a factor @xmath91 for @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath92 in ( [ eq12 ] ) , or , equivalently , to @xmath93 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that the critical line corresponding to @xmath93 would be to the right of the dash ",
    "dotted @xmath94 line , hence no parameter space would be left for short  period nlmbx formation .",
    "physically this means that due to the correspondingly slower evolution the systems would not reach contact within the age of the galaxy .",
    "this underlines the sensitivity of our result to the strength of magnetic braking for main  sequence stars in the critical mass range where the convective envelope disappears . to illustrate this",
    "further we consider the lower limit @xmath95 we obtain for the post  sn orbital distance @xmath96 when the requirement @xmath97(he ) is combined with ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) : @xmath98 note that this limit does not depend on magnetic braking and that @xmath95 is essentially determined by @xmath64 ( @xmath66 , @xmath99 ) .",
    "for nlmxbs with main  sequence donors of mass @xmath64 to exist at all the detached evolution time @xmath42 needed to shrink the orbit from @xmath95 into contact must be shorter than @xmath26 . on the other hand , to ensure that a large fraction of the secondaries are significantly evolved when mass transfer turns on , @xmath42 must be longer than a certain minimum fraction @xmath100 of @xmath26 .",
    "this places a tight limit on the allowed strength of magnetic braking for systems with secondary mass @xmath64 , initial orbital distance @xmath95 and neutron star mass @xmath66 : @xmath101 independent of the functional dependence of @xmath42 on mass and period .",
    "the narrow range @xmath102 also implies a very restricted range for @xmath49 : from fig .  1 we see that this must obey @xmath103 using the analytic fit @xmath104 from kalogera & webbink ( 1996b ) to stellar models by schaller et al.(1992 ) we see that the mass of the ms progenitor of the helium ( and ultimately neutron ) star must be in the range @xmath105 immediately before the ce phase",
    "the primary has evolved beyond core he exhaustion and has lost mass in the form of stellar winds .",
    "interpolation of schaller et al.s models suggest that primaries from the mass range ( [ eq16 ] ) will then have masses @xmath106 in the range @xmath107 wind mass loss carrying the specific a.m.  of the mass  losing component increases the orbital separation as the inverse of the total mass .",
    "hence the ms parent binary orbit is closer by a factor @xmath108 than the immediate pre ",
    "ce binary orbit .",
    "simple treatments of common  envelope evolution",
    "( e.g.  wk ) lead to the relation @xmath109 where @xmath110 are the binary separation before and after the common ",
    "envelope phase , @xmath111 is the fraction of the orbital binding energy used to drive off the envelope , @xmath112 is a weighting factor for the gravitational binding energy of the envelope to the core , and @xmath113 is the fractional size of the primary s roche lobe at the start of the ce phase .",
    "we find with the mass limits ( [ eq13 ] , [ eq14 ] , [ eq16a ] ) and @xmath114 , @xmath115 @xmath116 since there is little orbital evolution before the helium star undergoes its supernova explosion , and the post  sn separation is within a factor of 2 of the pre  sn separation , we can translate this into limits on @xmath117 , or equivalently the orbital period of the progenitor binary .",
    "we get an upper limit from requirement ( c ) ( cf [ eq4 ] ) , and a lower limit from requirement ( a ) , using ( [ eq5 ] ) and the fact that @xmath118 .",
    "( this limit prevents nlmxb progenitors emerging from the common ",
    "envelope phase with the ms secondary already close to filling its roche lobe , which is wk s condition 6 ; the requirement here gives a tighter limit .",
    "this in turn justifies our assumption above that the post  sn period @xmath13 was much larger than the contact period @xmath119 . )",
    "the resulting constraints are close , i.e. @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "together they show that the orbital distance @xmath122 and period @xmath123 of the ms progenitor @xmath124 binary must lie in the range @xmath125 and @xmath126 the formation channel we have considered requires that the progenitor fills its roche lobe after core  heluim exhaustion but before it would explode as a sn . for a @xmath7 ms star",
    "this implies @xmath127 or @xmath128 ( kalogera & webbink 1996b ) , thus reducing the limits ( [ eq19a ] ) , ( [ eq19 ] ) even further .",
    "if most short  period nlmxbs in the galaxy form via helium  star supernovae , this restricted range of allowed inital orbits and the very narrow limits ( [ eq13 ] , [ eq16 ] ) then show that only an extremely small progenitor population can produce these systems , explaining their comparative rarity .",
    "following iben et al .",
    "( 1995b ) a very crude estimate of the galactic short  period nlmxb formation rate @xmath129 can be obtained from @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the allowed range of the quantity @xmath132 .",
    "( [ eq191 ] ) relies on standard assumptions for the distribution of initial orbital parameters in newly forming zams binaries , in particular on a flat distribution in @xmath133 .",
    "using the limits obtained above we find @xmath134 .",
    "replacing ( [ eq191 ] ) by the initial parameter distribution of zams binaries used in kalogera & webbink ( 1996b ) gives a similar value for @xmath129 .",
    "in reality supernova explosions are probably not spherically symmetrical , and give the compact primary remnant a kick velocity .",
    "in this case the main differences from the considerations in 2.1 are twofold ( see e.g.  kalogera 1996a ) . first , a suitably directed kick can unbind binaries that would have been stable according to ( [ eq8 ] ) , or keep together binaries that would have disrupted according to this inequality .",
    "the latter case requires a kick velocity comparable to the pre  sn orbital velocity of the companion , directed almost parallel to its instantaneous motion , and is therefore rather rare unless the kick velocity is close to an optimum value near the pre  sn orbital velocity .",
    "second , relation ( [ eq21 ] ) no longer holds , and @xmath135 can be either smaller or larger than @xmath59 ( but never larger than @xmath136 ) .",
    "these two effects not only widen the allowed region of nlmxb formation in the @xmath137 plane of fig .  1 , but in particular allow the formation of nlmxbs with almost unevolved secondaries .    in the absence of a theoretical understanding of the origin , magnitude and direction of kick velocities the standard approach in population synthesis considerations ( e.g.  brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 , terman et al .",
    "1996 , webbink & kalogera 1996b ) is to assume that the kicks are isotropic and that their magnitude derives from a given distribution function , characterized by a certain r.m.s .  value @xmath138 .",
    "as demonstrated e.g.  extensively by kalogera ( 1996a ) the resulting probability distributions can be expressed in terms of the two governing dimensionless parameters , the ratio @xmath139 of kick velocity to relative orbital velocity in the pre  sn orbit , @xmath140 , and the ratio @xmath141 of post  sn and pre  sn binary mass , @xmath142 .    given the stochastic nature of the problem only a full population synthesis",
    "can provide a quantitative estimate of the fraction of nlmxbs with significantly nuclear  evolved secondaries at turn  on of mass transfer . to illustrate the main effect of kick velocities and to gain a very rough estimate of the maximum kicks we can tolerate and still maintain the large fraction of systems with evolved secondaries found for spherically symmetrical sne",
    ", we make use of the analytic expression for the distribution of binaries over @xmath143 derived by kalogera ( 1996a ) under the assumption of a maxwellian kick velocity distribution . in fig .",
    "2 we show the same limits as plotted in fig .  1 , but with the factor @xmath144 in ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) replaced by the approximate median value of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , for small ( @xmath149 ) , moderate ( @xmath150 ) and large kick velocities ( @xmath151 ) , respectively .",
    "these median values depend only weakly on @xmath141 . for strong kicks the critical line ( [ eq8 ] )  which is equivalent to @xmath152",
    " was replaced by the line @xmath153 as the survival probability of these systems is only a factor of 2 smaller than the one for the most stably bound systems ( corresponding to @xmath154 ) .",
    "the resulting enclosed area in the @xmath137 plane can be thought of as representative for the effective parameter space of nlmxb formation .",
    "assuming that the area is a measure of the corresponding relative formation rate , fig .",
    "2 suggests that in the case of standard magnetic braking ( [ eq1 ] ) systems with unevolved secondaries still constitute only a small fraction of nlmxbs for @xmath155 , represent the majority for @xmath150 , and entirely dominate for @xmath156 .",
    "more efficient magnetic braking would increase the dominance of unevolved systems even further , whereas a favourable combination of weaker magnetic braking and a kick velocity distribution with small ( or moderate ) mean velocity could both ensure the formation of the ( otherwise forbidden ) class of short  period nlmxbs , and the predominance of nuclear - evolved main  sequence donors .",
    "however , a population subject to a large mean kick velocity would necessarily contain a large fraction of systems where the secondary is close to contact in the post  sn orbit and hence essentially unevolved at mass transfer turn  on  whatever the strength of magnetic braking .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first , the limit ( [ eq12a ] ) formally allows post  sn orbital periods shorter than the contact period @xmath119 for @xmath157 , and with strong kicks a large fraction of such binaries would survive the sn .",
    "second , the sn ",
    "induced orbital reduction factor @xmath145 is very small for the majority of systems .    in view of this , the large fraction of soft x - ray transients observed among nlmxbs provides a strong argument not only against a magnetic braking stronger than our standard case ( [ eq1 ] ) , but also against a mean kick velocity of order @xmath158  kms@xmath9 ( @xmath159 ) invoked by lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ) from observed pulsar proper motions .",
    "2 shows that kick velocities must on average be small compared to the pre ",
    "sn orbital velocity , probably @xmath160 .",
    "this is consistent with a more recent reevaluation of the initial velocity distribution of radio pulsars which confirms the existence of the high  velocity tail found by lyne & lorimer , but suggests that the distribution has its maximum at zero velocity , hence a smaller average value ( hansen & phinney 1996 , hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "short  period nlmxbs might also form from systems with initially fairly massive main  sequence secondaries above the limit for thermally stable mass transfer , @xmath161 , provided these survive the initial phase of thermal timescale ( hence super  eddington ) mass transfer .",
    "( systems with @xmath162 would probably develop a delayed dynamical instability , see hjellming 1989 ) .",
    "kalogera & webbink ( 1996a , b ) pointed out that such systems could reappear as stable nlmxbs with sub  eddington mass transfer rate and donor mass @xmath163 .",
    "an analysis similar to the one in 2.1.2 ( using @xmath70 instead of @xmath42 ) reveals that a significant fraction of them would emerge from the ce phase almost semi  detached .",
    "they would turn on mass transfer with an unevolved secondary , again in conflict with the observed comparatively large fraction of transients among nlmxbs .",
    "hence we conclude that this channel can not contribute significantly to the formation of short  period nlmbxs .",
    "recently , kalogera ( 1996b ) has described yet another formation mechanism for lmxbs where no ce phase is involved .",
    "instead the orbital shrinkage is achieved by a suitably directed kick when the primary star in the wide progenitor binary explodes as a sn before it reaches its roche lobe .",
    "population synthesis models show ( kalogera 1996b ) that the production of short  period lmxbs via this channel is altogether negligible compared to the standard he ",
    "star sn case if the kick velocities are large ( @xmath138 of order @xmath164  kms@xmath9 ) , but might account for a formation rate comparable to the one derived in 2.1.2 if @xmath138 is close to an optimum value @xmath165  kms@xmath9 .",
    "however , in the latter case a relatively large fraction of lmxbs would start the x - ray phase with a very small ( below @xmath166 ) donor mass , hence with essentially unevolved secondaries .",
    "again , this suggests that the direct sn mechanism represents only a minor channel for the formation of short  period nlmxbs ( whereas it might be important to produce long  period systems with @xmath167 d ) even if kick velocities are generally small .",
    "the difference between the period histograms of lmxbs and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , in which the primary is a white dwarf , has long been remarked ( e.g.  white & mason 1985 , van  den  heuvel & van  paradijs 1988 , verbunt & van  den  heuvel 1995 , kolb 1996 ) .",
    "the most prominent difference is a total ( or near  total ) lack of lmxbs in the @xmath168 min region below the famous cv period gap .",
    "a ks test reveals that there are also statistically significant differences above the gap .",
    "the hypothesis that the lmxb and cv samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution can be rejected at a confidence level @xmath169 in the period range @xmath170  mins  2  d ( fig .",
    "3a ) , and at @xmath171 in the range 3  h  2  d ( fig .",
    "this can not be explained by selection effects discriminating against short orbital periods , since many of the x  ray periods were turned up by satellites such as exosat which had a 4day orbit .",
    "the differences conflict with the simple picture of cvs and lmxbs as essentially the same in terms of their secular evolution , apart from the substitution of a white dwarf by a neutron  star or black  hole primary .",
    "however our arguments above show that this simple picture is inaccurate , particularly for nlmxbs .",
    "cvs emerge from common  envelope evolution with a full range of secondary masses down to @xmath172 .",
    "the vast majority of these stars are essentially unevolved , and the post  ce separations are so small in many cases that the secondaries are close to their roche lobes .",
    "the majority of cvs probably start mass transfer at periods below the gap ( more than 67% according to king et al .",
    "none of these features hold for nlmxbs , as we have seen : the secondaries are confined to the narrow range @xmath84 initially , a large fraction of them must be significantly nuclear  evolved , the post ce ( and sn ) roche lobes are considerably larger than the secondaries , and they start mass transfer at periods in the range @xmath173  hr @xmath174  hr .    we investigate differences between the cv and nlmxb period histogram which arise alone from these effects in fig .  4 . in particular , we test if the population of nlmxbs below @xmath175 hr is much smaller than for cvs , as the lack of the enormous influx of newly  formed systems boosting the cv distribution there would suggest . despite this lack the expected intrinsic period distribution ( fig .  4 , middle panel ) derived from a typical evolutionary sequence ( fig .  4 , upper panel ) still predominantly populates the short period range , simply because the period evolves more slowly there ( number density @xmath176 ) . however , these short  period systems are suppressed for any visibility function @xmath177 with @xmath178 ( fig .  4 , lower panel ) .",
    "such a visibility function corresponds for example to a flux ",
    "limited sample taken from a disc  like population .",
    "in addition , the detection probability function obtained in this way shows a pronounced peak at long orbital periods ( here @xmath179  hr ) , a feature consistent with the observed lmxb overpopulation at long orbital periods compared to cvs ( see fig .",
    "this peak is a consequence of the high mass transfer rate immediately after contact is reached in nlmxbs , since the systems are close to instability ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the complexity of quantifying the relevant selection effects makes it difficult to decide if @xmath178 properly describes the nlmxb population .",
    "however , only if indeed @xmath181 is an additional mechanism needed to account for the lack of short  period systems .",
    "one such mechanism is the evaporation of the secondary star by pulsar irradiation from a rapidly rotating neutron star spun  up by accretion ( van  den  heuvel & van  paradijs 1988 ) .",
    "remarkably , this implicitly assumes that all lmxbs cross the gap , i.e.  assumes the result we have demonstrated above .",
    "we have shown that short ",
    "period neutron star low  mass x - ray binaries forming from helium  star supernovae without kick velocities must have secondaries with masses in the narrow range @xmath182 .",
    "for standard strenghth magnetic braking the secondary star is already significantly nuclear  evolved when mass transfer begins , explaining why the resulting mass transfer rates are in many cases low enough for a substantial fraction of these systems to appear as soft x ",
    "ray transients even at short ( @xmath15  d ) orbital periods ( cf paper 1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the neutron star receives a strong kick velocity at birth , many nlmxbs would form with unevolved low  mass donors .",
    "the observed large fraction of sxts among nlmxbs then forces us to conclude that kick velocities must be small compared to the pre  sn orbital velocity ( @xmath183 , i.e.  @xmath184  km / s ) for a large fraction of progenitor systems .",
    "this is consistent with a recent reevaluation of observed pulsar proper motions which suggest that the distribution of neutron star velocities at birth has a maximum at zero .",
    "similarly , short ",
    "period nlmxbs forming from both initially thermally unstable systems ( kalogera & webbink 1996a , b ) and via the direct sn channel ( kalogera 1996b ) would have a large fraction of ( low  mass ) unevolved secondaries , suggesting that neither of these channels contribute significantly to the short  period nlmxb population .    ignoring the uncertain survivors of thermally unstable mass transfer",
    ", the very special formation conditions for the case with negligible kick velocity also show that only a very restricted progenitor population ( essentially @xmath185 binaries with periods @xmath186 yr ) can form nlmxbs , explaining their rarity in the galaxy .",
    "we estimate a total formation rate @xmath187 yr@xmath9 .",
    "the formation conditions are much more restricted than for cataclysmic variables .",
    "in particular short  period nlmxbs must all begin mass transfer at periods @xmath188 hr , in contrast to cvs , of which a majority start mass transfer at periods @xmath1 hr .",
    "the resulting nlmxb period histogram has far fewer systems at short periods than the cv version , in agreement with observation .",
    "the smallness of the area of the @xmath189 plane ( fig .",
    "1 ) allowing short  period nlmxb formation is very striking .",
    "the fact that the resulting population has several properties in good agreement with observation is implicit confirmation that the assumed formation conditions are realistic . in particular",
    "it is clear that the neutron star mass at formation can not be significantly larger than @xmath190 : if it were , the allowed area would become much larger , sharply decreasing the predicted relative population of transient systems .",
    "however , we can say nothing about the lower limit on the formation mass , as systems with @xmath191 would not appear as nlmxbs ( the allowed area in fig",
    ".  1 would disappear ) .",
    "this result suggests another conclusion : with initial conditions @xmath192 , evolution without mass loss would lead us to expect neutron star masses @xmath193 in short  period systems , or those where direct estimates of @xmath64 give a low mass , such as cen x4 ( shabaz et al .",
    "1993 ) . as there is no observational support for such masses",
    ", this suggests that a large fraction of the mass transferred in the nlmxb phase is lost from the binary .",
    "the most likely way for this to occur is through mass loss from the accretion discs in these systems ( cf begelman , mckee & shields , 1983 ; czerny & king , 1989 ) .",
    "if the mass is lost at disc radii much greater than the size of the neutron star the central accretion rate can in principle be smaller than the mass transfer rate , so it may be simplistic to infer the latter from the observed x  ray flux .",
    "this in turn would mean that the presence of transient behaviour would pose a somewhat less stringent upper limit on the mass transfer rate than we inferred in paper 1 .",
    "this paper has discussed the formation of lmxbs containing neutron stars .",
    "the constraints on the formation of black  hole lmxbs appear to be weaker ( cf , e.g. , romani 1994 , 1996 ) , as are the conditions for them to appear as transients ( paper 1 ) .",
    "we shall investigate this problem in a future paper .",
    "we thank ron webbink and vicky kalogera for providing us with a copy of their papers on lmxb formation prior to publication and for very helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank the referee for useful comments .",
