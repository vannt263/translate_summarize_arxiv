    "the standard model ( sm ) is a mathematically consistent renormalizable field theory which predicts or is consistent with all experimental facts  @xcite .",
    "it successfully predicted the existence and form of the weak neutral current , the existence and masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons , and the charm quark , as necessitated by the gim mechanism . the charged current weak interactions , as described by the generalized fermi theory ,",
    "were successfully incorporated , as was quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the consistency between theory and experiment indirectly tested the radiative corrections and ideas of renormalization and allowed the successful prediction of the top quark mass .",
    "nevertheless , despite the apparent striking success of the theory , there are a lot of reasons why it is not the ultimate theory .",
    "first there is the well - established experimental observations of neutrino oscillations which are impossible in the sm .",
    "secondly , some values of the sm parameters are not calculable in the theory , notably , the fermion mass hierarchy , the hierarchy of symmetry - breaking scales , and the higgs boson mass .",
    "hence the theory has far too much arbitrariness to be the final story . finally , there exist purely theoretical difficulties in describing hadrons by means of the available methods of quantum field theory .",
    "these and other deficiencies of the sm motivated the effort to construct theories with higher unification of gauge symmetries .    in the framework of the grand unification hypothesis  @xcite , it is possible to obtain a reasonable explanation of the relation @xmath4 that is based on the logarithmic renormalization - group dependence of the gauge coupling constant on the energy .",
    "note , however , a similar analysis is not successful for the electroweak interaction , whose coupling constants are small at the scale @xmath5 gev . it is unrelated to any dynamical scale and is introduced into the theory as a free parameter .",
    "one immediate consequence of the grand unification hypothesis is a very simple explanation for the experimentally observed charge quantization .",
    "this is because the eigenvalues of the generators of a simple non - abelian group are discrete while those corresponding to the abelian group are continuous .",
    "unfortunately , by now lep data have shown  @xcite that simple non - susy grand unifications must be excluded , initially by the increased accuracy in the measurement of the weinberg angle , and by early bounds on the proton lifetime  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "gauge coupling unification can not be achieved in the sm if we choose the canonical normalization for the sm group , i.e. , the georgi ",
    "glashow @xmath6 normalization . also , to avoid proton decay induced by dimension-6 operators via heavy gauge boson exchanges ,",
    "the gauge coupling unification scale is constrained to be higher than about @xmath7 gev .",
    "this latter restriction is not true for gauge - higgs unification  @xcite , however . in gauge - higgs models ,",
    "the compactification scale may be of the order of the electroweak .",
    "such unification is a very fascinating scenario beyond the sm since the higgs doublet is identified with the extra component of the higher dimensional gauge field and its mass squared correction is predicted to be finite regardless of the non - renormalizable theory .",
    "this fact has opened a new possibility to solve the gauge hierarchy problem without , for example , supersymmetry .",
    "obviously , the gauge - higgs coupling unification can be achieved at the electroweak scale only with a suitable normalization .",
    "note also that the unification group of the model does not necessarily be simple .",
    "for example , such group may be represented as a product of identical simple groups ( with the same coupling constants by some discrete symmetries ) or it may be obtained as an extension of a simple lie group by means of a finite group of operators . the latter possibility will be considered in this paper .",
    "we begin by discussing the following simple construction .",
    "this construction arises in connection with the following question : is it possible to embed an arbitrary group @xmath9 in some group @xmath10 with the property that every automorphism of @xmath9 is the restriction of some inner automorphism of @xmath10 ?",
    "let @xmath11 be a subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "then for @xmath10 one may take the set of ordered pair @xmath13 with multiplication defined by the rule @xmath14 there @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "( we are writing pairs without their customary comma and brackets . )",
    "the group axioms are straightforward to verify . from the rule for multiplication ( [ 2 - 01 ] ) it is immediate that @xmath17 .",
    "hence the problem is solved .",
    "the group @xmath10 is called the extension of the group @xmath9 by means of the automorphisms in @xmath11 and denoted as @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively one says that @xmath10 is a semidirect product of @xmath9 by @xmath11 .",
    "now let @xmath11 be a subgroup of the outer automorphisms group of @xmath9 .",
    "suppose @xmath19 is a representation space of @xmath9 .",
    "then the representation of @xmath9 in @xmath19 induces a representation of @xmath10 in the direct sum @xmath20 , where each direct summand @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath19 and @xmath22 . for the space",
    "@xmath21 one may take the ordered pair @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "then the action of @xmath10 on @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 let @xmath27 be a set of elements of @xmath9 such that @xmath28 for all @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , it is a @xmath11-invariant subgroup of @xmath9 .",
    "using the formula ( [ 2 - 02 ] ) one may define a representation of @xmath27 on @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath27 acts equivalently on each direct summand of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a simple gauge group .",
    "if the normalization of the generators of @xmath9 are fixed , then the gauge couplings will be the same for both @xmath9 and @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that for the energy scale @xmath29 an @xmath9 gauge theory possesses both discrete and gauge symmetries , whereas for @xmath30 the symmetries breaking @xmath31 to take place .",
    "then the representation space of @xmath27 reduces to @xmath19 and hence the normalization of the generators of @xmath27 must be changed . since the definition of coupling constants depends on the normalization of the generators it follows that the gauge coupling of @xmath27 should be also change , namely @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "now we suppose @xmath34 .",
    "this group has the outer automorphisms group @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , and two majorana  weyl real eght - dimensional representations that related to the eght - dimensional real vector representation by the action of @xmath1 .",
    "the group @xmath0 can not contain the sm group as a subgroup , but it contains disjoint subgroups @xmath37 and @xmath38 that are isomorphic to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we always can choose these subgroups in the following manner :    \\(i ) @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 ,    \\(iii ) @xmath28 for all @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "hence , if for the energy scale @xmath30 the discrete and gauge symmetries breaking of @xmath8 to take place , then the gauge couplings of @xmath37 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 should be satisfy @xmath51 as @xmath30 .    just as for @xmath0 , the group @xmath8 can not contain the sm group as a subgroup .",
    "nevertheless , in the next section we shall show that there is a way to break the symmetry by @xmath52 moreover , the symmetry breaking is such that the gauge couplings of the sm group also satisfy ( [ 2 - 05 ] ) .",
    "this possibility of the breaking is based on the following mathematical construction  @xcite .    as was remarked before",
    ", the group @xmath9 admits the outer automorphisms @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 ( i.e. @xmath56 is the centralizer of @xmath54 in @xmath9 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the factor space @xmath58 .",
    "our nearest aim is to define a binary composition on the cosets of @xmath56 .",
    "define @xmath59 for each left coset @xmath60 , there exists exactly one element @xmath61 in @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .",
    "this defines a permutation representation of @xmath9 on @xmath57 ; if @xmath64 for @xmath16 let @xmath65 . using this permutation representation",
    ", we may define a binary composition in @xmath57 . if @xmath66 , define @xmath67 .",
    "this binary composition make @xmath57 into a nonassociative loop isomorphic to @xmath68 , which is defined in appendix a. in particular , this defines the permutation representation of @xmath9 on @xmath68 . extending this action by linearity on @xmath69",
    ", we obtain the eight - dimensional spinor representation of @xmath9 .",
    "apart from the left action of @xmath9 on @xmath57 , there exists the trivial right action of @xmath9 on @xmath57 with @xmath56 acting on itself by multiplication on the right .",
    "suppose @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ". then the ( left ant right ) actions of @xmath9 on @xmath57 induce the left action of @xmath38 on @xmath57 and the right action of @xmath37 on @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , these group actions are independent of each other .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the gauge - higgs model based on the group @xmath72 .",
    "consider the @xmath0-invariant gauge theory defined on the manifold @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the minkowski spacetime and @xmath68 is the seven - dimensional sphere .",

    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 are matrix representations of @xmath75 and @xmath83 $ ] is the image of the point @xmath84 under the operation of @xmath85 .",
    "but unlike the standard orbifolding conditions , we suppose that @xmath86 .    in order to determine automorphisms that are responsible for the symmetry breaking ( [ 2 - 04 ] ) , we must first select the group @xmath75 .",
    "suppose @xmath87 .",
    "further , suppose that the subgroup @xmath88 in @xmath0 is generated by the operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which are defined in appendix b. obviously , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it follows from this that @xmath93 , where the subgroups @xmath94 and @xmath95 are generated by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "define the action of @xmath75 on @xmath68 and the representations @xmath99 and @xmath100 as follows .",
    "let @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 be homomorphisms of @xmath75 onto @xmath88 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 respectively",
    ". then @xmath104&=f_{j}(k)^{-1}y.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now focus our attention on the symmetry breaking at the fixed points .",
    "since the factor group @xmath105 acts on @xmath68 trivially , it follows that the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is reduced ( under the given action ) to the centralizer of @xmath96 in @xmath0 , i.e. , to @xmath106 ( see also appendix c ) . therefore the fields @xmath76 and @xmath77 take its values in the lie algebra @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , @xmath77 takes its values in @xmath108 ( which is the intersection of @xmath109 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "now consider the @xmath106 symmetry breaking by @xmath110 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 2 - 04 ] ) that the @xmath111 symmetry must be preserved under the action of @xmath110 on @xmath68 .",
    "this is possible only if the components of @xmath77 are independent of @xmath112 , i.e. , if @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the usual gell - mann matrices for @xmath39 ( cf . the formulas in appendix c ) .    on the contrary",
    ", the unbroken symmetries of @xmath76 must belong to the centralizer of @xmath97 in @xmath106 . using ( [ b-03 ] ) and the explicit form of the generators of @xmath106",
    ", we prove that the fields @xmath76 take its values in the lie algebra @xmath115 .",
    "hence we can define these fields by @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the standard pauli matrices and @xmath118 are the components of @xmath119 .",
    "strictly speaking , we would have to write @xmath120 .",
    "however , in this case the field @xmath121 will be unobservable .",
    "the point is that for the kaluza ",
    "klein type theories to be able to describe the observed four - dimensional world it is necessary for the extra spatial dimensions to be compactified down to a size which we do not probe in particle physics experiments ( e.g. the planck length ) .",
    "therefore we suppose that the field @xmath121 has quantum fluctuations such that @xmath119 but not @xmath68 . in this case",
    "exactly one component of @xmath121 ( scalar field ) will be observed .",
    "we now consider the action of @xmath110 on @xmath68 .",
    "it is easily shown that the condition @xmath122 is equivalent to @xmath123 .",
    "hence @xmath112 belong to an associative subalgebra of @xmath69 generated by @xmath124 and @xmath125 . obviously , this is the algebra of quaternions with the basis @xmath126 .",

    "we have proved , in fact , that all nonzero fields @xmath121 in ( [ 2 - 07 ] ) must belong to @xmath127 .",
    "thus , if we identify @xmath121 as the massless higgs doublet , then we obtain a complete set of boson fields of the sm",
    ".    finally , consider the sm lagrangian for the field @xmath121 @xmath128 and suppose that the fields @xmath129 and @xmath130 in ( [ 2 - 08 ] ) are components of @xmath131 .",
    "then we have @xmath132 as usual the higgs vacuum expectation value breaks the @xmath40 symmetry down to @xmath133 . as a result we have the symmetry breaking ( [ 2 - 04 ] ) .",
    "the conditions ( [ 2 - 05 ] ) are valid in the @xmath8 limit .",

    "so for example eqs .",
    "( [ 3 - 08 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 09 ] ) will differ from that obtained in the sm .",

    "it do not contradict sm ( at least at the bosonic sector ) and gives precise predictions for the masses of the gauge bosons and the higgs scalar . here",
    "we make two general remarks .",
    "the group @xmath0 occupies a special position among the simple lie groups since only it has outer automorphism group @xmath1 .",
    "namely this property of @xmath0 permits to define the non - canonical normalization in a natural way and to get the gauge coupling constants unification . to describe the @xmath1-symmetry breaking",
    ", we embedded the @xmath0-gauge theory in the model with larger global symmetry groups .",
    "the motivation for this is that whatever the high energy physics producing the spontaneous breaking of the gauge group , it is likely to possess a larger global symmetry than the gauged one . we risk to suppose that the existence of discrete @xmath1-symmetry is related to a duplication of the fermionic structure in the sm .",
    "we suppose that @xmath200 is the discrete flavor symmetry group .",
    "but of course this is only a hypothesis .    in order to describe the gauge - higgs unification ,",
    "we have used the relation between @xmath0 and the algebra of octonions . generally speaking",
    ", this approach is not new .",
    "properties of octonions was used earlier to describe various mechanisms of compactification of @xmath201 supergravity down to @xmath202  @xcite ( see also the review  @xcite ) and to find solutions of the low - energy heterotic string theory  @xcite . there have been many other attempts over the years to incorporate this algebra into physics . the present paper is a next step in this direction .",
    "we recall that the algebra of octonions @xmath203 is a real linear algebra with the canonical basis @xmath204 such that @xmath205 where the structure constants @xmath206 are completely antisymmetric and nonzero and equal to unity for the seven combinations ( or cycles ) @xmath207 the algebra of octonions is not associative but alternative , i.e. the associator @xmath208 is totally antisymmetric in @xmath209 .",
