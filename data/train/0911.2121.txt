    "in 1922 , when lie cartan @xcite analyzed einstein s general relativity theory ( gr ) , he introduced in this context the concept of torsion into differential geometry .",
    "thereby he generalized riemannian geometry , dominated by the metric tensor @xmath0 and the riemannian curvature tensor @xmath1 , to riemann - cartan ( rc ) geometry carrying a generalized curvature @xmath2 and an additional fundamental third rank tensor @xmath3 , which was named torsion by cartan ; here @xmath4 are coordinate indices running either over @xmath5 ( space ) or over @xmath6 ( spacetime ) .",
    "whereas it is simple to visualize say a 2-dimensional ( 2d ) riemannian space as a curved 2d surface imbedded in a ( flat ) 3d euclidean space , no simple picture lends itself to a visualization of a space with torsion .",
    "still , already in his first publication on the subject , cartan @xcite , starting from 3d euclidean space , gave a prescription of how to arrive at a specific 3d space with homogeneous and isotropic torsion .",
    "we refer to this space as _ cartan s spiral staircase _ for reasons that will become clear in the next two paragraphs .",
    "this construction is largely forgotten in spite of being quite helpful in explaining the characteristic features of a simple space with torsion .",
    "the idea of cartan was the following : take a point @xmath7 of a 3d euclidean space @xmath8 in cartesian coordinates , as it is depicted in figure 1 . consider a neighboring point @xmath9 .",
    "the vector linking @xmath7 with @xmath9 will be denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "_ rotate _ now the triad in @xmath9 in accordance with the vector @xmath11 in the right hand - sense , where @xmath12 is a prescribed constant .",
    "the new rotated triad serves as a basis for the space @xmath13 with torsion : a vector in @xmath13 at @xmath9 is said to be parallel to a vector at @xmath7 , if its components in @xmath7 with respect to the local triad are the same as in @xmath9 with respect to the _ rotated _ triad .",
    "whereas the euclidean connection @xmath14 is zero with respect to the triads in @xmath8 , the new riemann - cartan connection @xmath15 vanishes with respect to the rotated triads .",
    "this new `` helical '' connection @xmath15 carries a non - riemannian piece that is proportional to the torsion .",
    "the space @xmath13 is like our ordinary space as viewed by an observer whose perception has been twisted @xcite .",
    "now , the vector @xmath16 can be decomposed into its components @xmath17 , that is , into rotations around the @xmath18- , @xmath19- , and @xmath20-axis , see figure 1 . accordingly ,",
    "if @xmath9 first coincides with @xmath7 and is then shifted further and further away from @xmath7 , then the triad along each of the three axes undergoes a helical motion , that is , it is like going up a spiral staircase along each of the axes .    in section 2 , following the prescriptions of cartan , we will construct , with the help of the calculus of exterior differential forms , the riemann - cartan connection @xmath15 of the spiral staircase @xmath13 . in this way , we can put cartan s idea in a very succinct form .",
    "we will determine the two - forms of torsion @xmath21 and of curvature @xmath22 of the spiral staircase .",
    "this will allow us to understand the 3d riemann - cartan space under consideration .",

    "as is clear from his acknowledgment , cartan was influenced in his investigations by the work of the brothers cosserat @xcite on continuum mechanics . in classical continuum mechanics  la euler and cauchy  to name two main figures of the orthodoxy  a medium with internal torque does not exist , since the classical medium can only support ( force-)stresses @xmath25 ( specifically with pressure @xmath26 ) , but no internal torques .",
    "however , already voigt @xcite had introduced the new concept of a ( spin ) moment stress tensor @xmath27 , which can exist in a suitable medium in addition to the ( force ) stress tensor @xmath25 .",
    "then , specifically an internal torque @xmath28 can be defined , with @xmath29 as totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol .",
    "the notion of a ( spin ) moment stress tensor has been brought to fruition in the work of the brothers cosserat .    to get an intuitive feeling for their type of approach , we can start , as cartan did , with euclidean geometry and its fundamental notions of _ translation _ and _ rotation_. on the one hand , these two geometrical notions are  via a suitable variational principle intrinsically related to the static notions of force stress and spin moment stress , on the other hand , if one restricts the validity of euclidean geometry only to local neighborhoods ( `` gauging of the euclidean group '' ) , one ends up , guided by cartan , with a riemann - cartan geometry with torsion and curvature .",
    "this brings us back to cartan s medium with constant pressure @xmath23 and constant internal torque @xmath24 as image of his spiral staircase : apparently a cosserat medium , generalizing the medium of classical elasticity , fluid mechanics , etc .",
    ", is appropriate for this purpose . accordingly , cartan s introduction of the torsion has as a consequence a more general conception of a continuum than the one taken for granted in classical continuum mechanics .",
    "as far as we aware , nobody considered so far the implications of the spiral staircase to a cosserat continuum .",
    "we will describe our corresponding results that the spiral staircase produces constant hydrostatic pressure and constant internal torque in a linear , incompatible isotropic cosserat medium in section 3 .",
    "let us recall that cartan was in the process of analyzing gr , that is , a gravitational theory . in the course of these investigations , he developed the skeleton of a new , slightly generalized theory of gravity .",
    "this four - dimensional theory of gravitation , to which cartan laid the foundations , was worked out by sciama and kibble around 1961 , see @xcite , and is called einstein - cartan ( ec ) theory of gravity .",
    "it is one of the very few viable theories of gravity .    in the meantime , however , also a somewhat speculative three - dimensional ( 3d ) ec - type model of gravity , with a lagrangian proportional to the curvature scalar of the rc - space , has been proposed .",
    "this 3d ec - model has an _ exact solution _ with a geometry described by the spiral staircase and _ matter _ of the cosserat type carrying constant pressure and constant spin moment stress ( torque ) .",
    "we believe that it is this solution that cartan described in words .",
    "the corresponding derivations and the details will be presented in section 4 .",
    "moreover , in the 3d framework there also exist gravitational models with lagrangians _",
    "quadratic _ in torsion and curvature ( poincar gauge models ) .",
    "the most general one of these is a model of mielke & baekler @xcite , see also mielke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and klemm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in which cartan s helical staircase occurs and plays an important role .",
    "the mielke - baekler model has a so - called btz ( baados , teitelboim , zanelli ) black hole _ with _ torsion as an exact vacuum solution @xcite .",
    "also in section 4 we show that a subcase of the vacuum btz - solution with torsion ( namely for @xmath30 ) carries the torsion of the spiral staircase  and for vanishing mass and angular momentum @xmath31 , also its connection @xmath32 .",
    "in contrast to the ec - solution mentioned above , it is an exact _ vacuum _ solution and , accordingly , was outside the scope of cartan in 1922 , as we shall see in section 4 .",
    "let us now turn to an important point of our investigations : during the 1950s it became clear that _ crystal dislocations _ can be described by cartan s torsion  @xcite , basically since dislocations , similar as torsion , can break open infinitesimally small parallelograms , in this way inducing a _ closure failure _ of the parallelogram ; for reviews , see krner @xcite and , furthermore , ruggiero and tartaglia @xcite . since dislocation lines are discrete objects , it is helpful to consider in this context a `` continuized crystal '' @xcite .    during the last years",
    "a successful gauge field theory of dislocations has been developed by lazar  @xcite and lazar and anastassiadis @xcite ; for different versions , see @xcite and the reviews @xcite . within this theory ,",
    "the equivalence between torsion and dislocation density plays a leading role .",
    "then immediately the question comes up whether cartan s spiral staircase is an _ exact solution _ of lazar s gauge theory of dislocations and whether one can find , indeed , constant pressure and constant internal torque in the corresponding medium .",
    "it appears intuitively clear that the spiral staircases along the three cartesian axes  with the same pitch!must be implemented by three forests of parallel _ screw dislocations _ ; the forests should be perpendicular to each other and each of them be of the same dislocation density , that is , their respective burgers vectors should be the same and constant , see @xcite . this distribution of screw dislocations should provide a constant torsion of the twisted type that , by means of the constitutive laws , should induce constant pressure and constant internal torque  provided cartan s intuition was right and lazar s theory appropriate .",
    "we prove in section 5 that with lazar s highly non - trivial gauge theory of dislocations we can derive , in linear approximation , the constant pressure and the constant internal torque for the first time in a realistic setting .    in section 6",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with the literature .",
    "the geometrical arena for our considerations consists of a three - dimensional manifold @xmath33 together with a local euclidean _ metric _ @xmath34 . at each point",
    "we introduce a _ coframe _",
    "field @xmath35 , with the anholonomic ( or frame ) indices @xmath36 , and , dual to it , the _ frame _ field @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the interior product . in a trivial orthonormal coframe @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 the corresponding trivial frame field is @xmath42 . thus , more explicitly , we have @xmath43 the holonomic ( or coordinate ) indices @xmath44 run over @xmath5 .",
    "a @xmath45-basis for 0- , 1- , 2- , and 3-forms is @xmath46 , the hodge dual @xmath47-basis for 3-,2-,1- , and 0-forms is specified by @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the hodge star and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 as the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol with @xmath52",
    ".    this formalism can be straightforwardly generalized to @xmath53 dimensions and to a lorentzian metric with , in @xmath54 , @xmath55 .    in the case of the spiral staircase , see figure 1 , we have an underlying three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath8 with _ flat _ metric ( that is , vanishing riemann curvature ) and , accordingly , with a euclidean connection 1-form @xmath56 that has vanishing torsion and vanishing curvature .      cartan introduced , besides this euclidean connection @xmath57 , for the space @xmath13 a non - euclidean helical _ riemann - cartan connection _",
    "1-form , @xmath58 in the following way , see figure 1 : if we consider the non - euclidean parallel displacement along the @xmath59-axis , then , according to cartan s recipe , the corresponding orthonormal coframe rotates in the positive sense around the @xmath59-axis with the angle @xmath60 per unit length .",

    "only the axial torsion part is nonvanishing , @xmath88 in this case the autoparallels of the riemann - cartan space coincide with the riemannian geodesics ( extremals ) .",
    "this is obvious in the cartan construction : here the geodesics are just the straight lines of the underlying euclidean space  and they are at the same time the autoparallels in the newly constructed riemann - cartan space of constant axial torsion and constant riemann - cartan curvature . , which is depicted in figure 1 by means of the constantly rotating triads whenever they move in a given direction .",
    "we find @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , our image represents exactly the cartan description .",

    "hence the force equilibrium law ( [ forceequi ] ) is guaranteed . moreover ,",
    "even the peach - koehler force 3-form  ( [ pkf ] ) itself is zero : @xmath294 thus , the elastic stress and the dislocation stress are conserved , separately , @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",

    "let us first turn to the former equation . since the torsion is known , we can write down ( [ fund1  ] ) explicitly : @xmath300 applying the star to the equation , we find @xmath301 with @xmath302 , we have @xmath303 in symbolic notation we can write @xmath304 this means that the object of anholonomity is constant , that is , we have a constant ` vorticity ' field .",
    "this coincides with our intuition of the distribution of screw dislocations .    in order to solve ( [ tor3 ] ) approximately , we linearize the coframe , @xmath305 .",
    "we substitute it into ( [ tor3 ] ) and find @xmath306 then we can read off the result @xmath307 or , in terms of the distortion 1-form @xmath308 the distortion describes a rotation perpendicular to the @xmath309-plane .    with the help of ( [ linear1 ] ) we find the three different pieces of the distortion as @xmath310 in turn , the constitutive law ( [ const_sigma ] ) expresses the stress @xmath199 in terms of the distortion ( [ linear1 ] ) .",
    "if we substitute ( [ f - ir ] ) into ( [ const_sigma ] ) and compare it with ( [ sigma - el ] ) , we find for the hooke type moduli @xmath311 the elastic modulus @xmath259 corresponds to the compression modulus @xmath141 , with @xmath312 . in this way , the dislocation modulus @xmath254 can be expressed in terms of the modulus of compression and the pitch of helices : @xmath313 thus , we conclude that cartan s spiral staircase is a solution in the gauge theory of dislocations provided the moduli of the underlying material obey the conditions ( [ rel - cm ] ) .",
    "summing up : in the framework of dislocation gauge theory , we found @xmath314 if we compare with cartan s spiral staircase ( [ result ] ) , we observe that there is a difference to second order in @xmath315 : the riemann and the riemann - cartan curvature exchange places .",
    "for cartan s spiral staircase we have a teleparallelism with respect to the riemannian ( or levi - civita ) connection , for the forests of the screw dislocations the underlying riemann - cartan space is teleparallel .",
    "insofar the dislocation theory led to a slightly different result as compared to the spiral staircase .",
    "this is not unexpected : let us consider the case of a constant dislocations density in a real crystal .",
    "then dislocation theory for geometrical reasons predicts that the underlying connection , in terms of which the torsion is defined , has to be teleparallel , see @xcite .",
    "a second remark is in order : the torque stress @xmath316 is linear in the pitch @xmath274 and the hydrostatic pressure @xmath317 quadratic in @xmath274 .",
    "thus , the pressure corresponds to a nonlinear effect .",
    "this is consistent with the screw dislocation distribution specified .",
    "in linear elasticity , the stress fields of screw dislocations are represented by pure shear stresses .",
    "therefore , a constant pressure , caused by screw dilations , can only occur in the nonlinear regime .",
    "hence our picture is apparently consistent .",
    "as we have seen , cartan s spiral staircase corresponds to a homogeneous and isotropic torsion distribution in _ three _ dimensions .",
    "is it also possible to have such torsion distributions in _ two _ dimensions in the case of positive definite signature ?",
    "no , this is not possible since for @xmath318 from the three irreducible pieces of the torsion only the _ vector _ ( or trace ) piece @xmath319 survives , see ( [ trator ] ) .",
    "isotropy then requires @xmath320 .",
    "geometrically 2-dimensional torsion distributions have been studied by schuecking and surowitz @xcite , sec.14 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have a method to visualize a three - dimensional distributions of homogeneous and isotropic torsion , and this may help to understand the corresponding situations in gravitational physics , in particular in the framework of the poincar gauge theory of gravitation . we wonder whether one can find in this framework a simple cosmological model with constant and isotropic torsion .",
