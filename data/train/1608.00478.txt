    "we first prepare a ultracold fermi gas of @xmath0yb atoms by trapping slow ytterbium atoms exiting from the zeeman slower in the @xmath2s@xmath46p@xmath44 intercombination magneto - optical trap ( mot ) at 556  nm  @xcite . the narrow linewidth @xmath73  khz of the intercombination transition results low enough doppler temperature allowing for cold gases around the temperature of @xmath820@xmath74k in the mot  @xcite . during the loading stage ,",
    "however , the detuning of the mot cooling light is externally modulated at a frequency of 100  khz to increase the capture velocity of the intercombination mot .",
    "the mot cooling light at @xmath75 is detuned by 31@xmath76 from the @xmath2s@xmath46p@xmath44 transition with the magnetic field gradient of 2.03  g / cm . before the loading into the crossed optical dipole trap , we compress the mot over 50  ms by increasing the magnetic field gradient to 11.6  g / cm and switching off the frequency modulation of the mot light .",
    "typically , we load @xmath773 - 4@xmath78 atoms into the mot within 20  s in this work .",
    "the ytterbium atoms are then loaded into a 1064  nm crossed optical dipole trap ( odt ) for forced evaporation with a trap depth up to @xmath79700  @xmath74k where @xmath80 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the crossed optical trap consists of a tight odt with 15  @xmath74 m beam waist inclined at 15 @xmath7 from the horizontal plane and a horizontal shallow odt with 56  @xmath74 m beam waist . after the final stage of the optical evaporation , we achieve a six - component degenerate fermi gas of @xmath85.0@xmath29 atoms at the temperature of @xmath30  0.27 where @xmath31 is the fermi temperature of the trapped atom with the trapping frequency of @xmath81=@xmath33130  hz .    after the evaporative cooling in the crossed odt , a pair of raman coupling beams is ramped up adiabatically with @xmath5510@xmath56 as described in fig .",
    "[ sfig_sequence ] .",
    "subsequently , the two - photon detuning of the raman beam is exponentially tuned to a near - resonant frequency . to detect the momentum distribution of atoms , both raman beams and the odt beam",
    "are abruptly switched off before time - of - flight expansion followed by absorption imaging .",
    "the spin - sensitive blast beam is inserted for spin - sensitive imaging .",
    "alternatively , the optical stern - gerlach ( osg ) light can be briefly pulsed after the magnetic bias field is rotated parallel to the osg light within 200 ms . during the expansion , we apply 3 ms of 10  mw osg light in order to separate the different spin components .",
    "in contrast to alkali atoms , alkaline - earth - like atoms with two valence electrons have negligible linear and quadratic zeeman shift . in this work ,",
    "we lift the hyperfine level in the ground manifold by introducing spin - dependent ac stark shift .",
    "the light shifts are given by the sum of the dipole matrix elements over the @xmath82 excited state manifold @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the single - photon rabi frequency of the ground - state @xmath47 for the @xmath86 polarized light and @xmath87 is the single photon detuning with respect to the @xmath83 excited hyperfine level .",
    "the differential ac stark shift between @xmath88 and @xmath89 is calibrated by monitoring the oscillation of the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) population during the two - photon rabi oscillation induced by a pair of co - propagating lights ( see fig .",
    "[ sfig_cal ] ) . in this case , no momentum is imparted to atoms so that the rabi oscillation is momentum - insensitive , which allows for precise calibration .",
    "furthermore , we set the intensity of the beam @xmath90 to be much higher than beam @xmath91 such that the differential ac stark shift is mainly tuned by the the beam @xmath90 .        in the three level lambda system with a large single photon detuning , the excited states can be adiabatic eliminated .",
    "so the probability to perform a transition from initial purified state @xmath89 to state @xmath88 during a time @xmath92 is @xmath93 . here",
    ", the effective rabi frequency is @xmath94 , while the two photon detuning @xmath28 is decided by @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 is the beating frequency of the raman coupling lasers , and @xmath97 is the differential ac stark shift . in the experiment , we fix the effective rabi frequency @xmath98 which only depends on the laser intensity and single photon detuning , so the differential ac stark shift keeps the same value in this process .",
    "then we change the beating frequency and measure the modified rabi frequency @xmath99 finding the resonance condition of @xmath100 ( see fig .",
    "[ sfig_cal ] ( a ) ) .",
    "in addition , the modified rabi frequency is monitored for different values of @xmath101 which is complementary calibration of the differential ac start shift in the system as shown in fig .",
