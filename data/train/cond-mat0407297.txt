    "the relation between equilibrium and non - equilibrium states is a central problem in the physics of disordered systems .",
    "disorder induces a multitude of metastable states in which the system can easily be trapped .",
    "the dynamics is usually very slow , or glassy , and on observational timescales the system is basically always out of equilibrium . on the other hand , from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is easier to consider equilibrium properties , since in this case it is possible to use all the machinery of statistical physics to tackle the problem .",
    "the question is whether the equilibrium properties of disordered systems provide a faithful representation of the non - equilibrium states in which the system is likely to be found in practice .",
    "this dichotomy is at the core of many unsolved issues in the field of disordered system .",
    "typical quantities that one could compare are the energy , the geometric characterization of the state ( as domains in magnets ) , and the energy cost of excitations .",
    "a simplification of the problem is obtained considering only athermal processes , in which the temperature of the system plays no role and can be ignored .",
    "the equilibrium state is in this case just the ground state ( gs ) , the state of minimal energy @xcite .",
    "a zero temperature , non  equilibrium dynamics is purely relaxational : the system falls simply in the closest metastable state .",
    "a convenient way to allow the system to explore the various metastable states is by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "different field histories typically result in hysteresis and lead to different metastable configurations @xcite .",
    "the demagnetization process consists in applying a slowly varying ac field with decreasing amplitude , and provides a simple way to access low energy states @xcite .",
    "it has been studied for more than a century , but until recently the question how close the demagnetized state ( ds ) is to the true gs was not addressed .",
    "this is the concern of our work , the problem of how such an optimization process works in the case of a random magnet .",
    "recently , pazmandy et al . have proposed the demagnetization process as the basis for a new optimization algorithm for disordered systems @xcite .",
    "the idea behind such `` hysteretic optimization '' , is that demagnetization leads to a low energy state , sufficiently close to the gs , which can then be reached by applying other methods using the ds as an input .",
    "the method was tested for different models like spin glasses and np  hard problems .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the random - field ising model ( rfim ) , that , while retaining some complex features characteristic of disordered systems , still allows for a theoretical analysis @xcite . in the rfim , due to the absence of frustration ,",
    "the equilibrium state is relatively simple , however , the non  equilibrium dynamics is far from trivial .",
    "due to the coupling of the local disorder to the order parameter , even the gs presents a variety of phenomena , which can be studied numerically @xcite .",
    "in fact the gs of the rfim can be found in a polynomial cpu - time , with exact combinatorial algorithms @xcite and solved exactly in @xmath0 and on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium critical exponents for random field magnets have been measured experimentally in fe@xmath6zn@xmath7f@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the hysteretic properties of non equilibrium rfim have been widely studied in the recent literature .",
    "the hysteresis loops display a disorder induced phase transition : for low disorder the loop has a macroscopic jump at the coercive field , while at high disorder the loop is smooth , at least on the macroscopic scale @xcite . at smaller scale",
    "the magnetization curve is highly discontinuous , showing barkhausen - type bursts , in correspondence to jumps between different metastable states @xcite .",
    "a disorder induced non - equilibrium phase transition in the hysteresis loop has been studied experimentally in co - coo films @xcite and cu - al - mn alloys @xcite .",
    "extensive numerical simulations have been used to characterize disorder induced transitions in the non - equilibrium rfim and critical exponents have been estimated in several dimensions @xcite .",
    "the model has been studied by the renormalization group and the exponents have been computed in a @xmath9 expansion @xcite .",
    "in addition the hysteresis loop has been computed exactly in @xmath0 and on the bethe lattice , where the disorder induced transition is present for sufficiently large coordination number .",
    "while in @xmath0 there is definitely no transition , the situation in @xmath10 is less clear .",
    "recently the problem of minor loops has been tackled analytically and numerically . in particular , the demagnetization curve has been computed exactly in @xmath0 @xcite and on the bethe lattice @xcite , extending previous calculations @xcite of minor loops .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the rfim are governed by a zero - temperature fixed point , and in finite dimensions ( @xmath11 in practice ) gs calculations have elucidated the properties of the phase diagram . in @xmath1",
    "the gs displays a ferromagnetic phase transition induced by the disorder . as domain wall energy arguments and exact mathematical results",
    "indicate , in @xmath10 there is no phase transition but an effective ferromagnetic regime for small systems , while in @xmath0 the rfim is trivially paramagnetic .",
    "it has been suggested that the transition in the gs is ruling the transition in the non - equilibrium hysteresis loop , also because mean - field calculations give the same results in and out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "numerical values of the exponents are close but not equal , but one must consider the difficulties in extrapolating values from the finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "more recently , the question of the universality of the exponents , with respect to the shape of the disorder distribution , was discussed in @xmath4 simulations , mean - field theory , and on the bethe lattice @xcite .    below we report a detailed comparison of the zero temperature equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties of the rfim with gaussian distribution of the random fields .",
    "we first analyze the problem in @xmath0 , where exact results can be obtained .",
    "the average value of the energy is computed as a function of the disorder strength for the ds and the gs .",
    "a direct comparison of the two values shows that for weak disorder the differences become more substantial , while for strong disorder , where each spin basically aligns with the random field , the difference tends to vanish .",
    "numerical studies using the same disorder realizations reveal that the main difference between the two states comes from the complete reversal of gs domains in the ds .",
    "this is also visible in the overlap between the gs and ds .",
    "we then study the @xmath4 case in which both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic behavior exist . the question of whether the transitions appearing in the gs and in the hysteresis loop are universal has often been debated in the literature @xcite . at the mean - field level",
    "it is not possible to distinguish the equilibrium and the non - equilibrium case and the transition if thus trivially the same .",
    "in addition , the @xmath12 expansion for the equilibrium and hysteretic transitions is the same to all orders , but one should always consider the possibility of non - perturbative corrections to the field theory .",
    "numerical simulations in @xmath4 indicate that the critical exponents and the critical disorder in the two transitions are reasonably close , but the numerical uncertainties do not allow for a conclusive statement about their identity . here",
    "we directly compare the behavior of the gs and the ds in @xmath4 close to the disorder induced phase transitions .",
    "we show that while the non universal critical parameter @xmath5 differs in the two cases , the universal finite - size scaling curve for the order parameter can be collapsed on the same curve .",
    "this suggests some kind of universality in the gs and the ds transitions .",
    "the numerical simulations for the gs and ds are done for the same disorder realizations for the both cases , for cubic lattices of linear sizes @xmath13 .",
    "the results are averaged over several realizations of the quenched random fields . in both cases ,",
    "we compute the average magnetization as a function of the disorder width .    a difference in the location of the critical point for equilibrium and non - equilibrium behavior of the same model may appear rather peculiar and one could be tempted to ascribe it to finite size corrections . in order to clarify this issue ,",
    "we have solved exactly the model on the bethe lattice and compared the results for gs and ds . while the exponents , as expected , are the same , coinciding with the results of mean - field theory , the critical disorder differs in the two cases .",
    "namely the transition in the ds occurs at a lower disorder value .",
    "thus there is an intermediate parameter region where the gs is ferromagnetic but the ds is paramagnetic . in conclusion ,",
    "the solution on the bethe lattice corroborates the picture obtained from simulations in @xmath4 . from the optimization viewpoint",
    ", the @xmath4 case shows an intermediate phase of `` bad '' correspondence between the gs and ds , exactly as in @xmath0 .",
    "this however stops as the @xmath2 is approached : naturally if both the states are ferromagnetic the optimization of the ds is much easier . to further explore the question of universality of the two transitions in the gs and in the ds ,",
    "we have computed the distribution of the magnetization at the respective critical point , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for different lattice sizes .",
    "the distributions can again all be collapsed into the same curve .",
    "finally , we consider the question of when is it actually possible to reach the exact gs via demagnetization . to this end",
    ", we consider a reverse field history ( rfh ) algorithm that allows in principle to construct a field history to get to the gs , if possible at all .",
    "studies of the @xmath0 case illuminate the difficulty of optimizing since it turns out that for anything but very strong disorders @xmath14 the probability to reach the gs rapidly decays to zero .",
    "our main conclusion is that , in general , demagnetization is not a good technique for reaching states that are truly close to the equilibrium , except in cases where the outcome is clearly similar from the very beginning ( fm states and pm states where the disorder is strong ) .",
    "this holds for both the energy of the states and also for the spin configurations .",
    "a simple formulation is that , since the ds is not optimized well in terms of the locations of domain walls , it has an excess random field ( zeeman ) energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the model and discuss its numerical treatment . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the one - dimensional case , analytically and numerically .",
    "section iv is devoted to the behavior around the disorder induced transition in @xmath4 and on the bethe lattice .",
    "section v demonstrates the rfh algorithm , together with numerical studies .",
    "conclusions are reported in section vi .",
    "an account of some of these results was briefly reported in ref .",
    "in the rfim , a spin @xmath15 is assigned to each site @xmath16 of a @xmath17dimensional lattice .",
    "the spins are coupled to their nearest - neighbors spins by a ferromagnetic interaction of strength @xmath18 and to the external field @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , to each site of the lattice it is associated a random field @xmath20 taken from a gaussian probability @xmath21 , with variance @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian thus reads @xmath22 where the first sum is restricted to nearest - neighbors pairs .    in this paper",
    "we will consider only the case of zero temperature , both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath23 equilibrium problem amounts to find the minimum of @xmath24 for a given realization of the random - fields ( i.e. the gs ) and then eventually perform the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this problem has been solved exactly in a number of simple cases , namely in @xmath0 and on the bethe lattice , for particular disorder distributions and studied numerically in generic dimensions .",
    "the rfim gs is solvable in a polynomial cpu - time , with exact combinatorial algorithms .",
    "for the one - dimensional case , the solution can be found via a mapping to a `` shortest path problem '' @xcite which effectively places the domain walls in optimal positions , corresponding to the global minimum of @xmath24 . for higher dimensions ,",
    "one starts by noticing that finding the rfim gs is equivalent to the min - cut / max - flow problem of combinatorial optimization .",
    "this can be solved in a variety of ways .",
    "we use a so - called push - relabel variant of the preflow algorithm @xcite .",
    "such methods , properly implemented , are in general slightly sub - linear in their performance as a function of the number of spins in the problem .    for the out of equilibrium case",
    ", we need to specify an appropriate dynamics , ruling the evolution of the spins .",
    "we will consider the dynamics proposed in ref .",

    "the limit of @xmath29 can be conveniently obtained by increasing the field precisely of the amount necessary to flip the first unstable spin .",
    "a single spin flip increases the local field of the nearest neighboring spins , generating an avalanche of flippings . when the systems finds another metastable state , the field",
    "is increased again .",
    "this dynamics obeys return - point memory @xcite : if the field is increased adiabatically the magnetization only depends on the state in which the field was last reversed .",
    "this property has been exploited in @xmath0 @xcite and in the bethe lattice @xcite to obtain exactly the saturation cycle and the minor loops .",
    "the main hysteresis loop selects a series of metastable states , which in principle are not particularly close to the ground state . to obtain low energy states",

    "the results of such calculations are shown in figs .",

    "the gs is the easiest since the domain walls are just point - like . for the gs",
    "we know that it is optimized such that all the large enough local random field fluctuations nucleate domains of the same sign .",
    "the rest of the random landscape is split up into regions that align themselves with such fluctuations depending on the sign of the random field excess , @xmath126 . as a result",
    "the zeeman energy of domains is linear in domain size , @xmath127 , and the asymptotic mean domain length follows the imry - ma prediction @xmath128 .",
    "moreover since the random landscape has a finite correlation length the domain size distribution is exponential @xcite .",
    "any qualitative differences in the ds will follow from three separate mechanisms : 1 ) shifts of domain walls , 2 ) creation of domains inside intact gs domains and 3 ) destruction of gs domains ( fig .",
    "[ mechanisms ] ) . from the point of view of  optimization \" the first one is of trivial concern , since it would have little effect e.g. on the scaling of @xmath129 .",
    "the second one is more detrimental if the energy difference to the gs is considered .",
    "in addition to the cost of the two domain walls it subtracts a contribution from the zeeman energy of the domain that persists and surrounds ( in the gs ) the one that is not created in the ds . the third one would make the largest change to the total energy , since for @xmath130 the energy of a domain consists mostly of its zeeman energy .",
    "numerical studies of the ds domain structure indicate that with decreasing @xmath14 the average domain size increases faster than in the gs , while the size distribution @xmath131 remains exponential . this is accompanied by a reduction in the overlap @xmath132 between these two states .",
    "for @xmath14 large the overlap is close to unity ; strong local fields @xmath20 align the spins in the same way regardless of the mechanism by which the spin state is created .",
    "for @xmath14 small the local field is no longer strongly correlated with the orientation of the spin , and thus whether the gs and ds are locally aligned depends on how optimized the latter is .",
    "the fundamental mechanism for the deviations between the states seems for @xmath14 small to be the  destruction \" of gs domains ( see fig .",
    "[ mechanisms ] again ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ qs ] by depicting the change @xmath133 in the overlap that comes solely from missing gs domains .",
    "the conclusion from this dominance is that the demagnetized states typically miss regions in which the integrated field fluctuation is large which as such leads in the gs to the formation of gs domain .",
    "therefore the overlap should get smaller the larger the scale - length on which one compares the ds and gs is , and this is confirmed by fig .  [ dsoverlap ] which shows the overlap between a ds domain and the gs as a function of the length of the ds domain .",
    "the importance of such destroyed domains can also be seen in the total contribution to the energy difference between the ds and gs . for @xmath14 small this",
    "is again dominated by the missing gs domains . in general the difference between the energies of",
    "the gs and ds derives from the combination of domain walls and zeeman energy .",
    "[ dszeeman ] shows that for @xmath134 small the ds domains do not have much zeeman energy .",
    "this changes if @xmath134 is larger , in which regime the scaling approaches the imry - ma -like scaling ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the implication is that the field energy of large domains in the ds self - averages , and comes from a sum of random contributions ( ie .",
    "the domains contain regions where the actual random field sum is _ opposite _ to the spin orientation , such as the missing gs domains ) .",
    "the cross - over between the small @xmath134-behavior and the asymptotic scaling is located close to @xmath136 .",
    "the rfim displays a disorder induced phase transition both in the gs and in the hysteresis loop , which can also be observed analyzing the ds @xcite .",
    "if the gs and the ds are always paramagnetic , the transition is absent and thus we perform numerical simulations in @xmath4 .",
    "our aim is to characterize the difference between ds and gs around the disorder induced transition .    in @xmath4 for low disorder ,",
    "the gs is ferromagnetic , while for higher disorder it becomes paramagnetic . for gaussian disorder",
    ", the transition point has been located numerically at @xmath137 .",
    "it is possible to define the usual set of critical exponents characterizing the phase transition and compute the values by exact gs calculations .",
    "for instance , the magnetization @xmath138 , with @xmath139 , scales close to the transition point as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the reduced order parameter and @xmath142 is a non - universal constant .",
    "the correlation length defines another exponent @xmath143 where @xmath144 is another non - universal constant which rules the finite size scaling of the model @xmath145 simulations yield @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "a disorder induced transition is also found in the hysteresis loop . at low disorder",
    "the loop shows a macroscopic jump , which disappears at a critical value for the disorder .",
    "this transition reflects itself in the ds , which is ferromagnetic when the main loop has a jump and is paramagnetic otherwise .",
    "the transition point has been obtained numerically in @xmath4 as @xmath148 and the critical exponents have been measured .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite reports data collapses with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "while there is strong evidence that the exponents measured in the ds should be equal to those measured on the main loop , the relation with the equilibrium transition is not clear .",
    "we notice first that numerical simulations reported in the literature indicate that the transition appears at slightly different locations in the gs and in the ds .",
    "hartmann and nowak report @xmath151 for the gs with system size up to @xmath152 , hartmann and young refine this value to @xmath153 with sizes up to @xmath154 , which is also confirmed by middleton and fisher which estimate @xmath155 . for the hysteresis loop",
    "the best estimate is @xmath156 , with system sizes up to @xmath157 and a similar value for the @xmath158 @xcite .",

    "the minimum of the overlap is located in the parameter region corresponding to the transitions ( i.e. @xmath169 ) . a decrease in the overlap around the transition",
    "can be expected , since for @xmath170 the gs is ferromagnetic ( @xmath171 ) and the ds is paramagnetic ( @xmath172 ) as it is also apparent plotting the difference in the magnetization ( see fig .  [ figdm ] ) .    in summary ,",

    "we consider here a bethe lattice with coordination @xmath76 and obtain the gs generalizing the @xmath0 case as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath36 refers to the generation of the lattice , and @xmath173 are the partition functions of a branch of generation @xmath174 with a fixed up ( down ) spin at the central site .",
    "the recursion relation for the @xmath173 is @xmath175 where for any given site @xmath16 the sum over @xmath176 runs over the @xmath177 nearest neighbors of @xmath16 away from the center of the lattice .",
    "then , following the @xmath0 case , one can write @xmath178 \\label{fb}\\ ] ] where @xmath179 so that the contribution at the free energy from site @xmath16 is @xmath180 @xmath181 is a stochastic quantity satisfying the equation @xmath182 when @xmath52 eq .",

    "@xmath54 is a solution for any @xmath18 and @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath184 there are also two stable solutions @xmath185 corresponding to the appearance of a ferromagnetic phase .    to perform quenched averages one has to solve for the probability distribution of @xmath186 , where @xmath187 , which satisfies the recursive functional equation @xmath188 so that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59 is given by the fixed point equation @xmath189 once @xmath59 is known , any thermodynamic quantity can be computed .",
    "in particular , the free energy per spin is given again by ( [ < f > ] ) and the magnetization at the central site of an infinite lattice , is given by eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) where @xmath64 are respectively the partition function with the spin at @xmath62 fixed up ( down ) .",
    "these are given by @xmath190 and @xmath191 for @xmath192 are the partition functions of the @xmath76 branches attached to the central site @xmath62 , with the boundary spin fixed up(down ) .",
    "this gives for the magnetization at the central site @xmath193 @xmath194 the magnetization for the infinite lattice can then be obtained averaging over the quenched variables @xmath69 : @xmath195 for a gaussian random - field distribution the fixed point equation can not be solved explicitly and we thus resort to a numerical integration .",
    "we obtain @xmath196 for @xmath197 , and for different values of @xmath14 , and compute the magnetization using eq .",
    "( [ magb ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figbethe ] we compare the magnetization of the gs with the one of the remnant magnetization in the ds , computed in ref .  @xcite . as",
    "observed in the simulations in @xmath4 , the transition occurs at two different locations ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ figbethe ] ) , for @xmath197 @xmath198 @xcite and @xmath199 , with the mean - field exponent ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "when plotted against @xmath201 the two curves superimpose close to the critical point .",
    "this indicates that , though not required by universality , in the bethe lattice @xmath202 , as also found in @xmath4 .    to investigate possible finite size scaling",
    "we have performed numerical simulations in the bethe lattice , following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . collapsing the order parameter curve as in @xmath4 , using a scaling form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqfss ] ) , does not appear to be possible in the bethe lattice , because the scaling region is very narrow .",
    "thus to test finite size scaling , we have computed the distribution of the magnetization @xmath73 at the respective critical point , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for different lattice sizes @xmath36 .",
    "the distributions can all be collapsed into the same curve ( see fig .",
    "[ figbethe2 ] ) , using the form @xmath203 .",
    "after having shown that the gs and the ds correspond to different microscopic configurations , we investigate now if the gs spin configuration may be reached by a field history other then the ac - demagnetization .",
    "the answer to this question requires a clarification on the relation existing between locally stable states ( given by the solutions of eq.([eq:2 ] ) ) , and the spin configurations visited along the non - equilibrium dynamics induced by the varying field . in fact , not all stable configurations may be reached by a field history from saturation . the problem has been treated in @xcite where it has been shown that , given a spin configuration obtained by a field history , supposed unknown , the sequence of reversal fields that applied to saturation gives back the original state can be recovered . for spin systems",
    "this inverse function is given by an algorithm which is able to construct the reverse field history ( rfh ) @xcite .",
    "this method is applied then to investigate if a given spin configuration may be reached by field history from saturation : if a field history leading to the state exists the algorithm produce a sequence of reversal fields ; if no field history exists the algorithm enters a recursive loop .",
    "the investigation of the properties of unreachable states has been recently performed and leads to a classification of stable states on oriented graphs @xcite .",
    "the study is performed here for the gs spin configuration that , for the rfim at finite size and for a given disorder realization , can be independently derived by exact combinatorial algorithms ( as the _ max - flow min - cut _ ) .",
    "consider the final spin configuration @xmath204 ( the set of @xmath36 ising spins ) resulting after the application of a field history ending at @xmath205 and consisting in a sequence of reversal fields @xmath206 from the saturated state and let us define the function @xmath207 .",
    "the set of all states obtained this way is defined as the hysteresis states ( h - states ) . due to adiabatic dynamical response and return point memory",
    ", this state @xmath204 will contain the memory of a subset of the reversal fields .",
    "in fact not all the reversal fields determine the final state @xmath204 .",
    "for example , in terms of average magnetization , the reversal fields which give rise to closed minor loops do not influence the final state , i.e. their memory is erased , while the memory of the set of reversal fields @xmath208 which are not erased is contained in the final state .",
    "the inverse function @xmath209 allows , starting from a spin configuration @xmath204 belonging to the h - states ensemble , to obtain the set of reversal fields @xmath208 which have been actually stored in the state and that - if applied as a field history - will reproduce the original state , i.e. @xmath210 .",
    "we define this set of reversal fields @xmath208 as _ minimal field history_.    the rfh algorithm takes as input a configuration @xmath204 at @xmath205 and gives as output - when it exists - the reversal field history from saturation to the state @xmath204 .",
    "the formulation of the algorithm is based on the order - preserving character of the dynamics @xcite , and is therefore , applicable to a wide range of models beyond the rfim .",
    "an interesting result of the rfh algorithm is obtained when it is applied to a state @xmath204 not belonging to the h - states ( i.e. where no field history exists ) .",
    "the iterated search for the reversal field sequence enters an iteration and , in this case , it can be shown that no field history leading to the state exists .",
    "the rfh algorithm was applied to explore the possibility to reach the gs by non equilibrium dynamics by the numerical study of the rfim in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we performed our investigations on systems having @xmath211 spins , averaging the results for 100 different realizations of the same disorder @xmath14 .",
    "the gs was obtained by the _ max - flow min - cut _",
    "procedure for each realization and the rfh algorithm was applied . at each disorder value @xmath14 , the fraction @xmath212 of the realizations in which the gs resulted to be reachable was computed . for comparison the same procedure",
    "was applied starting from locally stable states generated by random sampling the set of local minima .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[cap : fh ] .",
    "as a first finding the gs does not result to be systematically field reachable and the fraction depends on the disorder .",
    "one may conclude that the fact that the gs is sometimes reachable is a pure effect of the finite system size .",
    "also for the random states the fraction of found states f@xmath213 sensibly changes with @xmath14 , but following a different curve .",
    "if there was no correlation between gs and the h - states the two curves would be coincident .",
    "the dependence of f@xmath213 on @xmath14 reflects the fact that the number of h - states depends on the disorder value and the system size @xcite , and only at large disorder , where the number of locally stable states decreases , the ratio between h - states and stable states is significantly greater then zero .",
    "for disordered systems like the random field ising model one would be interested in both universality in statistical properties and in the question how to `` optimize '' in the case of a sample with a given distribution of the impurities . in this paper",
    "we have studied this problem in detail , by comparing the demagnetized and ground states .",
    "our main findings are the following : first , the character of the gs is such that it is globally optimized , and the demagnetization procedure does not perform well unless the optimization problem is rather trivial .",
    "this is slightly surprising since the conclusion holds in particular if the rfim gs is paramagnetic .",
    "then the ds does not manage to find the right spin configuration , so that as seen in the @xmath0 case many of the domains of the gs do not appear in the ds .",
    "second , in @xmath4 ( and with the aid of the bethe lattice solution ) , it can be demonstrated that the existence of a phase transition for both the ds and gs makes the `` phase diagram '' of optimization to show a regime where the outcome is less optimal : in the paramagnetic phase of the ds , where the gs is already ferromagnetic since the critical thresholds are ordered such that @xmath214 . in this regime ds and gs are expected to differ strongly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also provide numerical evidence that the @xmath4 transition appears to have the same critical exponents in both the gs and ds @xcite .",
    "this can be considered both surprising  there being no exact field theoretical way of treating the @xmath4 phase transition  and expected , since the functional renormalization calculations in spite of their shortcomings indicate that the actions are the same @xcite .",
    "it seems intriguing that such universality is met exactly in the limit where the `` optimized '' character of the ds changes .",
    "the results indicate that for the particular system at hand , where the disorder couples directly to the expected magnetization , `` local '' optimization methods have difficulties . of course , as in `` hysteretic optimization ''",
    ", one can perturb or `` shake '' the state obtained from the ds procedure to try to still lower the energy . these attempts are of course usually just heuristic . in the case of the rfim , the joint approach of optimizing by the ds and computing",
    "the gs exactly allows to understand better similarities and differences between equilibrium and low energy non - equilibrium states .",
    "in addition to the ferromagnetic rfim model , one can consider other systems where two disorder induced phase transitions exist .",
    "numerical simulations and analytical results have shown that a disorder induced transition in the hysteresis loop can be observed in the random bond ising model @xcite , in the random field o(n ) model @xcite , in the random anisotropy model @xcite and in the random blume - emery - griffith model @xcite .",
    "all these systems display as well a transition in equilibrium and it would be interesting to compare their ds and gs .    interfaces in quenched disorder would provide another interesting example , since the roughness exponent typically differs in and out of equilibrium ( i.e. at the depinning threshold ) @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to measure the roughness of an interface after a demagnetization cycle ( i.e. after the field driving the interface is cycled with decreasing amplitude ) , and compare its properties with those of the ground state interface .",
    "finally , there is the issue of energetics of excitations in the respective ensembles : the universality of exponents and scaling functions would seem to imply that these also scale similarly ."
