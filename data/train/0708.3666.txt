    "the @xmath2 jahn - teller problem , where electrons in a threefold degenerate orbital interact with a fivefold degenerate phonon multiplet , is known since more than 30  years .",
    "it first arised for the particular case of @xmath6-electrons in a cubic systems which are equally coupled to @xmath7 and @xmath8 vibrational modes  @xcite . on the level of linear coupling ,",
    "an equivalent problem arises in negatively charged c@xmath0 ions ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these materials experienced particular interest when superconductivity was observed in alkali - doped a@xmath10c@xmath11 ( a = k , cs , rb , for a review see ref .  ) .",
    "the neutral c@xmath11 molecule is a closed shell system and highly symmetric .",
    "it has icosahedral symmetry which is the largest threedimensional point - group with 1- , 3- , 4- and 5-dimensional irreducible representations ( ir )  @xcite .",
    "the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of c@xmath11 is threefold degenerate and has @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "it couples to two non - degenerate @xmath13 phonon modes and eight 5-fold degenerate @xmath14 phonon multiplets  @xcite . in the present work we focus on the non - trivial coupling to the @xmath14 multiplets .",
    "we restrict our attention to linear coupling and approximate the eight @xmath14 multiplets by one effective multiplet which gives rise to the linear , single - mode @xmath2 jahn - teller problem .",
    "furthermore , we will use the fact that the icosahedral ir s @xmath12 and @xmath14 correspond to the @xmath15 ir of so(3 ) which do nt split under the icosahedral symmetry  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the linear @xmath2 jahn - teller problem is equivalent to the problem of @xmath6-electrons interacting with @xmath16-phonons and recovers accidental so(3 ) symmetry .",
    "therefore , the present work really treats the linear @xmath17 jahn - teller problem and we will mostly speak of @xmath6-electrons and @xmath16-phonons throughout the following .",
    "note that the accidental so(3 ) symmetry would be lifted by higher order coupling terms  @xcite .",
    "in addition to electron - phonon coupling , electrons in c@xmath11 also interact via the coulomb interaction .",
    "this leads to the so - called hund s rule coupling ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "below , we will consider both , the jahn - teller and hund s rule interaction , and discuss the competition between them .",
    "the @xmath17 jahn - teller can not be trivially solved as , for example , a single displaced harmonic oscillator .",
    "this led to various different approaches .",
    "early work on the case @xmath18 was done by obrien  @xcite .",
    "the first treatment for all fillings was carried out in two subsequent papers by auerbach , manini and tosatti  @xcite .",
    "the first paper is based on a semiclassical ( also called adiabatic ) approximation which yields the effective hamiltonian in the strong coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate regime is explored using exact diagonalization .",
    "the weak coupling limit is treated in the second paper using perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the effect of hunds - rule coupling was studied subsequently using the same approach  @xcite .",
    "these works led to a good understanding of the @xmath2 jahn - teller problem .",
    "a complete discussion is given in ref .  .",
    "however , none of the schemes just discussed applies to the whole coupling range .",
    "even `` exact '' diagonalization is only valid for the small and intermediate regime because it suffers from truncation of the phonon hilbert space at high coupling .",
    "moreover , the approaches do nt provide wavefunctions in the intermediate regime , which is precisely the regime of c@xmath11 .",
    "there have been various attempts to construct wavefunctions for all coupling regimes on the basis of coherent states and projection techniques  @xcite .",
    "the formalisms used were rather involved and led to complicated analytical expressions and multidimensional integrals . here , we propose a mathematically equivalent but much more convenient formalism which is based on the use of projection operators .",
    "we construct variational states in two steps : first , we start with a product state @xmath19 which minimizes the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the phonon part @xmath20 is a coherent state which corresponds to the displacement @xmath21 of one phonon coordinate .",
    "this displacement leads to a splitting of the degenerate electronic levels .",
    "the electron part @xmath22 is chosen such as to minimize the energy of the electrons for a given splitting .",
    "the state @xmath23 is not so(3 ) symmetric and also not a good angular momentum state .",
    "however , the so(3 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian requires eigenstates to be angular momentum states .",
    "therefore , we use projection operators @xmath24 , as defined in  ( [ eq : qlmk ] ) , to construct angular momentum states @xmath25 .",
    "state @xmath26 is the final variational wavefunction with good quantum numbers @xmath27 and one variational parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath28 with respect to this state is @xmath29 .",
    "the equality arises because @xmath28 is a scalar and commutes with the projection operator .",
    "this is an essential simplification because each projection operator carries an integration over euler angles , as can be seen from definition  ( [ eq : qlmk ] ) .",
    "previous works havent made use of this property which , as we show below , allows an almost analytical treatment of the problem .",
    "the present approach is interesting because it is to a large extent analytical and applies to the whole coupling range .",
    "energies can be calculated with moderate effort which allows a detailed analysis of the competition between jahn - teller effect and hund s rule coupling .",
    "this competition determines the spin configuration of the ground state for the cases @xmath3 which we calculate for the complete parameter range .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : ham ] we introduce the hamiltonian as well as the effective mode approximation which reduces the multi - mode problem to a single - mode problem .",
    "the properties of the phonon coherent states are discussed in section  [ sec : coh ] . section  [ sec : c60m1 ] to  [ sec : c60m3 ]",
    "treat the cases @xmath30 respectively .",
    "as discussed below , the cases @xmath31 are equivalent to @xmath32 due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "results specific to parameters of c@xmath11 are discussed in section  [ sec : c60spec ] .",
    "due to the so(3 ) symmetry , angular momenta and its eigenstates , the spherical harmonics , play an important role in the present work .",
    "we always use real spherical harmonics @xmath33 which have @xmath34 or @xmath35 dependence .",
    "rotation and products of the real spherical harmonics lead then to real wigner - d functions @xmath36 and new clebsch - gordan coefficients denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding definitions are discussed in detail in appendix  [ app : rr ] .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the full multi - mode jahn - teller problem with coulomb interaction of the c@xmath0 ion has four terms : @xmath38 the first term is the energy of the 8 @xmath16-phonon multiplets @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the frequencies of the phonon multiplets  @xcite ( @xmath41 ) . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the phonon construction and annihilation operators . according to the definition in appendix  [ app : rr ] ,",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath44 correspond to the @xmath16-symmetries @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 respectively .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we only consider linear electron - phonon coupling which is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the coupling constants and @xmath52 the operators for the phonon coordinates . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the electron operators .",
    "they have spin @xmath55 and quantum numbers @xmath56 which correspond to the @xmath6-symmetries @xmath57 respectively .",
    "@xmath58 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the real spherical harmonics ( see appendix  [ app : rr ] ) .",
    "the resulting matrix elements of @xmath59 are given in  ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "note that both , the electron operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 as well as the phonon operators @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath60 are tensor operators with rank 1 and 2 respectively . the sum in  ( [ eq : hep ] ) involving the clebsch - gordan coefficients is the simplest non - trivial scalar which can be built from rank 1 and rank 2 tensors .    the last two terms in  ( [ eq : h ] ) describe the coulomb interaction among the @xmath6-electrons .",
    "the coulomb interaction splits the charge states @xmath3 into multiplets characterized by the total electron angular momentum and the spin because spin - orbit coupling is omitted .",
    "all multiplet energies can be expressed by two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath61 giving rise to the two terms @xmath62 and @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "they have the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total number of electrons . in the literature , @xmath62 is referred to as the hund s rule coupling and leads to the multiplet splittings listed in tab .  [",
    "tab : hund ] .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath61 , is the overall charging energy .",
    "it is of the order @xmath66  ev , depending on the screening  @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 is at least one order of magnitude smaller  @xcite as will be discussed in section  [ sec : c60spec ] . in the following",
    "we will drop @xmath63 because we always work with a fixed number of electrons .",

    "the quantum numbers @xmath68 denote the number of electrons , the total spin and total electron angular momentum . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the following we discuss the transformation to real spherical harmonics .",
    "this transformation applies not only to spherical harmonics , but to all quantities depending on the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath69 , such as the wigner d - functions and the clebsch - gordan coefficients . for the purpose of a clear notation , quantities in the complex spherical harmonics basis",
    "will be written with a tilde .",

    "creation and annihilation operators are transformed in the same way : @xmath85 the operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 are given by the same rules .",
    "note that @xmath88 creates an electron such that @xmath89 whereas the electrons created by @xmath90 have @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath93 symmetries for @xmath56 . using the definition @xmath94 for the complex wigner d - functions , the following transformation rule to the real wigner d - functions @xmath36",
    "can be deduced @xmath95 the real wigner - d functions are explicitly given by @xmath96 the functions @xmath97 are the same as used for the complex wigner - d functions @xmath98 .",
    "they are tabulated in various references  @xcite .",
    "the real wigner - d functions describe the rotation of tensor operators @xmath99 , such as @xmath100 , @xmath90 , @xmath87 and @xmath86 , which have the symmetries of the real spherical harmonics : @xmath101 finally , the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the real spherical harmonics are given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the usual clebsch - gordan coefficients for the complex spherical harmonics .",
