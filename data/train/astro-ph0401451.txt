    "ob runaways are a subgroup of spectral type o and b stars which are recognized by their unusually high velocity ( @xmath7 ) , often away from known star forming regions ( blaauw , 1961 ) . stone ( 1979 ) also included stars at large distance ( up to several kpc ) from the galactic plane for which no parent association could be found .",
    "about 40 per cent of o stars and 5 - 10 per cent of b stars are runaways ( stone 1991 ) , and only one in ten ob runaways has a known binary companion ( gies & bolton 1986 ) .",
    "the peculiar velocities of about @xmath8 ob runaways have been determined and the trajectories of @xmath920 can be traced back to a nearby association ( hoogerwerf et al . 2000 , 2001 ) , supporting the idea that these stars originated in stellar clusters from which they were later ejected with high velocities .",
    "the two main mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the high velocities of ob runaways are :    * ejection upon a supernova in a binary system ( zwicky 1957 ; blaauw 1961 ) ; * ejection by a close multiple encounter in a star cluster ( poveda , ruiz & allen , 1967 ) .",
    "we refer to scenario 1 and 2 as _ supernova ejection _ and _ dynamical ejection _ , respectively .    in the supernova ejection scenario",
    "the ob runaway gets a high velocity from the explosion of the companion star .",
    "if the binary is dissociated by the supernova , the companion star is ejected with a velocity of the order of its orbital velocity while if the binary remains bound , the mass loss in the supernova induces a recoil velocity in the center of mass of the binary ( blaauw 1961 ; hills 1980 ; tauris & takens 1998 ) .",
    "this scenario predicts that about 30 per cent of the ob runaways should still be in a binary with a compact companion .",
    "large natal kicks ( up to 1000@xmath3 ) are observed in isolated pulsars ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ) , but are not sufficient to explain the low binarity fraction observed for ob runaways .",
    "even if the formation of a neutron star is accompanied by a kick drawn from a maxwellian distribution with a mean of 600@xmath3 , about 30 per cent of the binaries remain bound ( portegies zwart 2000 ) .",
    "selection effects may be important in preventing the observation of compact companions to the runaways ( e.g. colin et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the supernova ejection scenario seems insufficient to explain all the known ob runaways ( portegies zwart 2000 ) .    the supernova ejection scenario , however , satisfactorily explains the high velocities ( @xmath10 ) of some known high - mass x - ray binaries ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "2000 ) . in one of these , vela x-1",
    ", the high space velocity is inferred from the morphology of a bow shock ( kaper et al .",
    "1997 ) while the neutron star is visible as an x - ray pulsar .",
    "the only known example of a binary dissociated by a natal kick is given by the o9.5v star @xmath11 oph and the pulsar psr j1932 + 1059 .",
    "the large rotational velocity ( penny 1996 ) and helium abundance ( herrero et al . 1992 ) of @xmath11 oph indicate that a phase of mass transfer occurred , as expected for runaways ejected by a supernova explosion . under this hypothesis ,",
    "a natal kick of about 400@xmath3 can be inferred for the pulsar ( hoogerwerf , de bruijne & de zeeuw 2001 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario to the supernova ejection is the dynamical ejection scenario ( poveda , ruiz & allen 1967 ; gies & bolton 1986 ; leonard 1990 ) , in which close encounters between binaries and/or single stars in dense stellar regions can lead to the ejection of stars with high velocity .",
    "young stellar clusters and ob associations in early evolutionary stages can have high stellar densities ( @xmath12 ) in their cores and therefore close encounters between single stars , binaries or higher order systems can be very frequent .",
    "these encounters can result in the ejection of stars with high velocities .",
    "o and b stars are more likely to participate in strong encounters than low mass stars because of mass segregation and gravitational focusing . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of close encounters involving o and b type stars can be high despite their short lifetime , especially when the cluster is young and the binary fraction is high .    to help understanding the runaway mechanism we define the _ kinematical age _",
    "@xmath13 as the time since the ejection from the parent association .",
    "this time can be derived integrating the trajectory of the runaway in the galactic potential . at first order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the distance traveled from the cluster and @xmath16 the velocity of the runaway .",
    "the kinematical age can help to identify the ejection mechanism .",
    "a runaway which is ejected by a supernova explosion has a kinematical age smaller than the age of the parent cluster because the primary star in the original binary evolved for a few million years before it exploded ejecting its companion .",
    "dynamical ejection is likely to occur when the cluster is very young and therefore in this case the kinematical age is often similar to the age of the parent system .",
    "an example of stars ejected by a dynamical encounter is provided by the single runaways @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the spectroscopic binary @xmath2 , whose trajectories in the galactic potential have been traced back in time and intersect about @xmath5myr ago at the expected location of the trapezium cluster ( hoogerwerf et al .",
    "the runaways @xmath0 and @xmath1 show no evidence of binary evolution , like a high rotational velocity or an increased helium abundance , and move in almost opposite directions away from the trapezium cluster .",
    "the kinematical and evolutionary properties of the system suggest the hypothesis that the stars were involved in a 4-body encounter that ejected them with high velocity .    in this paper",
    "we describe a combined use of direct n - body simulations and stellar and binary evolution calculations to identify the type of encounter that ejected @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath17 [ sec : prop ]",
    "we describe the main observational properties of the stars and a possible evolutionary model for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 and we propose a binary - binary encounter able to reproduce the current positions , velocities and physical properties of the four stars ; in section @xmath17 [ sec : binbin ] we describe the code used to perform simulations of 4-body encounters and the classification of the outcomes ; in section @xmath17 [ sec : simulations ] we describe the choice of initial conditions for the simulations , we present the main results obtained from the scattering experiments and we compare them with the observed properties of the stars while in section @xmath17 [ sec : evolution ] we present aspects of the evolution of the @xmath2 binary after the encounter that can affect the model for the dynamical encounter .",
    "the single runaway stars @xmath20 and @xmath21 are o type stars moving away from the orion star forming region . blaauw & morgan ( 1954 ) recognized them as a remarkable pair of runaways having similar spectral types and moving in almost opposite directions with space velocities of about 100@xmath3 . at a distance of about @xmath22pc from the trapezium cluster",
    "the kinematical age of both stars is about @xmath5myr .",
    "the same kinematical age and parent cluster for the two stars together with their relative straight angle of motion suggest a common origin in a dynamical encounter .",
    "gies & bolton ( 1986 ) advanced the hypothesis of a binary - binary interaction that ejected @xmath0 and @xmath1 and left @xmath2 as the surviving binary .",
    "they noticed that @xmath23 is one of the most massive objects in the orion nebula , has a high eccentric orbit and its component stars have relative orbital velocities similar to the space velocities of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "parallaxes and proper motions provided by _",
    "hipparcos _ together with radial velocity measurements ( turon et al .",
    "1992 ) are shown in table [ tab : vel ] and allow precise determinations of the galactic trajectories of the binary and the single stars .",
    "the integration of the trajectories of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 ( hoogerwerf et al .",
    "2001 ) in the galactic potential shows that @xmath24myr ago all the stars had a minimum separation of about 4@xmath25pc .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we relax the hypothesis of point mass stars and investigate the effects of physical radii on the outcomes of binary - binary encounters . in the simulations described in the previous sections , we keep track of the minimum distances between all stars . in this way we are able to use the same data and test the effect of finite stellar radii , assuming that stars collide if they approach each other within some minimum distance @xmath26 .",
    "since the initial eccentricities of both binaries are randomly drawn from a thermal distribution between 0 and 1 , stars in very eccentric orbits may collide at the first pericenter passage .",
    "this would not be realistic , and therefore we limit the range in initial eccentricities . in a highly eccentric orbit two stars with total radius @xmath27 collide if @xmath28 ( kopal 1959 ) . inverting this equation leads to our definition of @xmath29 .",
    "for the observed stellar radii ( see table [ tab : scheme ] ) @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore exclude binaries with initial eccentricity @xmath31 from further consideration .    , between stars during binary - binary encounters .",

    "since circular orbits are very rare in our standard initial conditions , we performed a separate simulation of 8000 encounters .",
    "if we assume stellar radii from tab.[tab : scheme ] at the moment of the encounter , a collision occurs if @xmath33 . in that case",
    "about half of the initially circular binaries result in a collision , whereas only 25 per cent of the eccentric systems survive merging . in figure",
    "[ fig : collemax ] we show the fraction of binaries that experience a collision as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "the two figures [ fig : cumulative ] and [ fig : collemax ] show similar trends ; high initial eccentricities enhance the collision rate .",
    ".,width=264 ]    in figure [ fig : branchemax ] we show the proportion of ionized systems and systems like @xmath23 which resulted from the standard run .",
    "there seems to be a slight preference for initial eccentricities in the range @xmath6 .    .",
    "the solid line gives the results for encounters in which one binary was ionized .",

    "changing the stellar radii ( or @xmath37 ) by a factor of a few does not effect the collision rate much , and therefore the choice of the stellar radii is not critical to the results .    .",
    "our system of interest is represented with the dashed line .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "until now we have considered the implications of a binary - binary encounter on the dynamical properties of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "the current observations of the binary allow us to constrain its evolution in the @xmath38myr elapsed from the moment of the encounter till now .",
    "there are at least three further aspects that have to be integrated into a wholly plausible model of the interaction under consideration .",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "@xmath23 might be a triple system , and possibly even quadruple or quintuple ( see @xmath17 [ sec : speckle ] ) ; 2 .",
    "stellar evolution models make it difficult to confirm that @xmath39 is of the same age as any of the other three stars ( see @xmath17 [ sec : age ] ) ; 3 .",
    "tidal friction must operate within the present @xmath23 system , and we have to check whether the observed eccentricity can have been maintained for the 2.5@xmath25myr since the collision ( see @xmath17 [ sec : tidal ] )",
    ".    we deal with these in turn .",
    "the spectroscopic binary @xmath23 is the brightest ( component a ) of three members of the multiple star ads 4193 .",
    "the other two members ( b and c ) are @xmath40 and @xmath41 distant . at the distance of @xmath23 ( @xmath42pc , see table [ tab : vel ] )",
    "these are quite widely separate , and for the time being we discount them as gravitationally bound companions . but ads 4193a is also a speckle binary , chara 250aa / ab , with a separation of @xmath43 ( mason et al .",
    "this suggests an orbital period @xmath44yr . the brighter component ( aa ) of this speckle pair is the spectroscopic binary . strictly speaking",
    "we should refer to the o9iii and b0.8iii - iv components of this @xmath45d binary as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and we do so from now on .",
    "the close speckle companion raises at least two questions .",
    "is it reasonable that the companion was carried along during the four - body ( or rather 5-body ) encounter that we have supposed ? and could it affect the eccentricity of the spectroscopic orbit , by the mechanism of kozai cycles ( kozai 1962 ) ?    we have not attempted to model 5-body encounters because of the enormous parameter space that they can be drawn from .",
    "we can imagine it would be possible for the companion to remain bound after an encounter but we doubt the energy released would be enough to eject @xmath20 and @xmath21 with high speed .",
    "it might be worth investigating this possibility in the future and testing these predictions .    in a triple system",
    "in which the outer orbit is fairly highly inclined to the inner orbit , the third body can have a major long - term effect on the inner pair , causing its eccentricity to cycle between a low and a high value .",
    "for instance , if the mutual inclination is @xmath48 , @xmath49 can cycle between 0 and 0.76 , or between 0.5 and 0.86 ( kiseleva , eggleton & mikkola 1998 ) .",
    "the period of the cycle is @xmath50yr in this case .",
    "if the triple were formed early in the life of the cluster by some random encounter , an inclination of @xmath48would be quite likely ; alternatively , the kind of encounter that we think is needed to create the binary @xmath51 would probably randomize its inclination relative to the ( @xmath52 ) speckle pair .",
    "thus it is possible that the observed high eccentricity of the spectroscopic binary @xmath51 is not a result of the encounter , but of the third body @xmath53 .",
    "we now use stellar evolution model to constrain the ages of the four stars .",
    "figure [ fig : hr ] is a theoretical hr diagram for masses in the range required .",
    "the positions of all four stars , according to their effective temperatures and gravities as given by bagnuolo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , are indicated .",
    "two isochrones are indicated , for 5 and 10 myr .",
    "it is clear that the apparent ages of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are substantially different : we estimate 5 and 10 myr respectively .",
    "the uncertainties appear to be of the order of @xmath54myr , but could be substantially greater on account of unquantifiable systematic errors .",
    "the possibility that discrepant ages can be accounted for by roche - lobe overflow can almost certainly be discounted by the high eccentricity of the system .",
    "the ages of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are comparable to that of @xmath46 , though @xmath20 might be a little younger and @xmath21 a little older .",
    "= 1.1 , 1.125, ... ,1.5 . also shown ( thick lines ) are isochrones for ages 5 myr and 10 myr",
    ". sloping nearly - straight dotted lines are for log @xmath55=2.8 , 3.0, ... ,3.8 , starting from the upper right corner and ending near the zams .",
    "approximate positions for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , based on their temperatures and gravities , are indicated by aa1 , aa2 , ae and @xmath21 respectively . in the scheme the epoch of formation of the eldest binary is labelled as @xmath56 , the moment of the encounter as @xmath57myr and the present epoch as @xmath58myr.,width=302 ]    the trapezium cluster , from which the four stars appear to have been ejected , is a well studied young cluster , the core of the orion nebula cluster , which contains about a dozen ob stars and many more fainter stars .",
    "it is estimated that these stars are @xmath59myr old ( herbig & terndrup 1986 ; brown , de geus & de zeeuw 1994 ; prosser et al .",
    "stars later than b2 are often though not always above the main sequence .",
    "we may therefore wonder if the two giants of @xmath23  are still evolving _ towards _ the main sequence rather than away from it .",
    "this seems improbable , because their ejection from the cluster @xmath5myr ago is amply long enough for contraction to the main sequence at their high luminosities .",
    "this suggests , incidentally , that not _ all _ the trapezium stars are as young as @xmath60myr , and we appear to require that some massive stars have been forming over the last @xmath61myr .",
    "an age spread from 1 to 10@xmath25myr has already been observed for stars @xmath62 ( palla & stahler 1999 ) , and we suggest that there may be a similar spread for ob stars .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the parent cluster is one of the older subgroups in orion such as subgroup 1a or 1c ( see brown et al .",
    "these subgroups have a kinematics very similar to the one of subgroup 1d ( which contains the trapezium cluster ) and overlap in position on the sky with @xmath23 .",
    "the uncertainties in the theoretical hr diagram are of course substantial , and hard to quantify .",
    "the models were computed using the code of pols et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which was found to give good agreement with the observational data of andersen ( 1991 ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties have to be convolved with observational uncertainties but very substantial error must be involved if @xmath47 is to be of the same age as any of the other three stars .",
    "a rather long shot is the possibility that the speckle companion is in fact the missing @xmath61myr - old companion of @xmath39 .",
    "this would require a binary - triple interaction of the form : @xmath63 @xmath64 it is hard to assess the likelihood of this but in any event we should not ignore the possible existence of a fifth body in a complete analysis .",
    "an important aspect to consider in the post - encounter evolution is the effect of tidal friction on the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "the sum of the radii that we infer is @xmath65 of the periastron separation , which would seem sufficient for tidal effects to be important .",
    "we have used the equilibrium - tide model of hut ( 1981 ) as further developed by eggleton , kiseleva & hut ( 1998 ) .",
    "this model was successfully tested on the smc radio - pulsar binary 0045 - 7319 ( eggleton & kiseleva ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "the orbital evolution expected since the encounter 2.5@xmath25myr ago is shown in figure [ fig : tidal ] .",
    "we find that we could reach the present eccentricity and orbital period if we started with @xmath66=110 days and @xmath49=0.91 .",
    "a high eccentricity is common for binaries which undergo exchange - ionization encounters as the final eccentricity distribution is expected to be thermal ( see @xmath17 [ sec : point ] ) . on the other hand , a long - period binary as a final outcome implies an even wider initial target binary , which means a lower binding energy available in the encounter .",
    "it is unlikely to obtain recoil velocities as high as 100@xmath3 with a pre - encounter total energy which is smaller than the current one .",
    "a tight binary ( with an orbital period similar to the observed one ) is needed in order to reproduce the velocities of the single runways .",
    "figure [ fig : tidal ] shows that parallelization ( the alignment of the spin axis of the two binary components ) and pseudo - synchronization took @xmath67myr to achieve .",
    "given the uncertainty in the viscous time - scale  at least a factor of 10  it is possible that they have actually not yet been achieved .",
    "the pseudo - synchronous rotation period ( hut 1981 ) is a fraction of the orbital period dependent only on eccentricity : the factor is 9.51 for @xmath49=0.76 , i.e. @xmath68d currently . with the radii computed from the evolutionary tracks of figure [ fig : hr ] , the rotation speeds we expect are @xmath69 and 115@xmath70 for the primary and the secondary respectively .",
    "these values are somewhat greater than the values ( 110 and 70@xmath70 ) quoted by marchenko et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and may indicate that pseudo - synchronism has not yet been reached .",
    "however we have already noted that the high eccentricity of the spectroscopic binary may not in fact have been generated by the collision but may be an artifact of kozai cycles driven by the third ( speckle ) body ( see @xmath17 [ sec : speckle ] ) . in kozai cycles , while the eccentricity fluctuates the semimajor axis is unperturbed ( to lowest order ) , and as a result the two components will in the long term seldom be as close together as they are at the periastra of the current orbit .",
    "thus tidal friction might be negligible in this case .",
    "the possibility that the eccentricity is due to the third body rather than to the interaction could mean that we have to revise our earlier conclusion that the apparently non - coeval nature of the spectroscopic binary is not due to roche lobe overflow , since the main argument against there having been any roche lobe overflow is that the orbit is eccentric",
    ". however kozai cycles are normally suppressed if the quadrupolar distortion of the stars in the close binary is large ; and it usually _ is _ large enough as a star approaches roche lobe overflow .",
    "once a star fills its roche lobe it normally grows larger still , until a very late stage of evolution when it has lost @xmath71 of its mass .",
    "thus once kozai cycles are suppressed they are unlikely to re - establish themselves till this late stage , when the donor would be a small helium star rather than a b giant .",
    "we hope that in the near future more information will be available on the speckle orbit , which should move appreciably in @xmath72yr",
    ". the spectroscopic orbit may also be on the margin of detectability by speckle or adaptive optics ; a direct measure of its inclination could limit the possibilities substantially",
    ". it will be desirable to search for the speckle companion in the spectrum of @xmath23 .",
    "if it can be detected it may modify significantly the spectroscopic elements of the 29@xmath25d orbit .",
    "we tried to reconstruct the event that ejected the runaways @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the binary @xmath23 from their parent cluster about 2.5@xmath25myr ago .",
    "we here summarize different models that could explain the high velocities of the single stars and the discrepant ages of the binary components .    *",
    "the single stars and the binary are all unrelated . as shown by gies and bolton ( 1986 ) and hoogerwerf et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) , this can be excluded on the basis of their kinematical and evolutionary properties .",
    "the same dynamical encounter must have ejected the stars from the trapezium about 2.5 @xmath25myr ago . in order to explain the high velocities of the single stars and the age difference in the binary",
    ", the encounter must have involved an ionization and an exchange . *",
    "the stars were ejected as a result of a binary - binary interaction that occurred in the trapezium cluster about 2.5@xmath25myr ago .",
    "this model is based on the observation that the velocity of the 4-body system is comparable to the velocity of the trapezium cluster .",
    "the velocities of the stars and the period of the binary after the encounter are consistent with the observed values , so that we can conclude that this model can well reproduce the kinematics of the 4-body system .",
    "if we consider stars with physical radii , a fraction of encounters result in a collision between two stars .",
    "we thus expect to find collision products in dynamically active young clusters like the trapezium .",
    "the fraction of collisions strongly depends on the initial eccentricity of the two binaries and therefore we consider it likely that @xmath23 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 were ejected in an encounter between two low - eccentricity binaries . in this case , the final properties of the system like the recoil velocities of the stars and the orbital period and eccentricity of @xmath23 do not differ from the ones obtained for highly eccentric initial binaries .",
    "the occurrence rate of this type of encounter , once corrected for the collision probability , is about one in 10 myr .",
    "+ a possible difficulty in this model is the short circularization time - scale for the orbit of the binary after the encounter .",
    "our calculations show that only extremely eccentric post - encounter orbits ( @xmath73 evolve in an eccentricity like that of @xmath23 after 2.5 myr .",
    "+ in addition , the model relies on the assumption that @xmath39 and @xmath21 are in the same binary before the encounter , implying that the two stars must be coeval .",
    "our evolutionary calculations show that @xmath21 might be too hot , or equivalently too early in spectral type , to be on the same isochrone as @xmath39 . however , our knowledge about the temperatures and gravities of the stars is sufficiently imprecise that we can assume coevality for all four stars . *",
    "the stars were ejected as a result of a triple - binary interaction .",
    "this model is based on the possibility that @xmath23 is the brightest component of a speckle pair , making it a stable hierarchical triple .",
    "this would require a 5-body encounter with the same total energy as our standard 4-body encounter resulting in the ejection of a triple and two single stars . according to this model",
    ", the high eccentricity of @xmath23 may be a result of kozai cycles driven by the third body .",
    "we havent tested this possibility but we can argue that this type of encounter would be rather rare and not energetic enough to explain the velocities of the runaways",
    ". it may certainly be worth investigating this scenario to test these predictions as well as the ones about corotation and pseudo - synchronisation .",
    "the last word has evidently not been said on the interesting interaction between @xmath23 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but we think it remains a fascinating combination of orbital dynamics , cluster dynamics , stellar evolution and tidal effects .",
    "in addition to more elaborate numerical simulations , high accuracy parameters for the stars are needed in order to settle the co - evality issue .",
    "new interferometric speckle observations , possibly resolving the spectroscopic binary too , will be crucial for a better understanding of the dynamical encounter that ejected the runaway stars .",

    "the procedure described in section @xmath17[sec : code ] for the computation of the maximum impact parameter in each scattering experiment is incorporated in the actual computation of cross - sections .",
    "the cross - section for an event x is derived from ( mcmillan & hut 1996 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of scatterings resulting in an outcome x in the shell @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the total number of scatterings performed in the shell @xmath76 .",
    "the uncertainty in the cross - section is given by @xmath78    in analogy to the case of binary - single star scattering ( hut & bahcall 1983 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) and in order to compute physical time - scales for different type of interactions , we define a cross - section @xmath79 normalized to the geometric cross - section and corrected for gravitational focusing .",
    "a characteristic time - scale for a process x , defined as the mean time between subsequent occurrences of x , can be evaluated from ( bacon , sigurdsson & davies 1996 ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the mean stellar density in the cluster and @xmath82 is the fraction of binaries in the core .",
    "during the numerical integration of a binary - binary encounter the status of the system is analysed after each 20 orbital periods of the initial target binary and the simulation is stopped if one of the following criteria is met :    * only two stars remain , in which case their orbits are determined and the system is classified as a binary if it is bound or as two single stars if it is unbound ; * three stars remain , in which case the system is considered ionized if the total energy is positive , the stars are widely separated and receding from each other while it is considered as a binary and a single star if the total energy is negative but the single star is escaping from the binary center of mass ; * the 4-body system is split in binaries whose centers of mass are unbound , widely separated and receding . in the other cases",
    "the system is considered bound and the integration continues until a stopping criterion is satisfied or a maximum integration time is reached ."
