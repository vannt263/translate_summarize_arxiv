    "recent attempts to solve the hierarchy problem rely on the existence of extra dimensions in our universe , thereby lowering the fundamental planck scale down to tev energies @xcite . in such scenarios ,",
    "gravity should get stronger at shorter distances , and therefore new phenomena should arise in tev - scale experiments .",
    "one of the most interesting of these new phenomena is the production of black holes in collisions where the centre - of - mass energy is higher than 1 tev @xcite . in this context , ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) stand out naturally as the best candidates for black hole production , through the interaction with matter in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the detection of events signaling black hole production , as well as their non - observation , would be of extreme importance , allowing to put constraints on the number of extra dimensions and on the effective planck scale .",
    "however , and so far , the proposed signatures of black hole production are based on statistical effects ( rates and angular distributions ) , not allowing identification on an event by event basis , and may lead to large uncertainties @xcite . in this note events with a double bang topology",
    "are proposed as an almost background free signature .",
    "we shall elaborate upon a particular type of event , characterised by the production and instantaneous decay of a microscopic black hole ( first bang ) followed , at a measurable distance , by the decay of an energetic tau lepton ( second bang ) .",
    "the characteristics of such events , and the capability of large ground - based cosmic ray experiments like auger  @xcite or of the future space based cosmic ray observatories euso  @xcite and owl  @xcite to detect them are discussed below .",
    "the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic neutrinos in the atmosphere has been pointed out as a good channel for the study of microscopic black hole production  @xcite . in the proposed scenario energetic neutrinos ( @xmath0 gev )",
    "interact deeply in the atmosphere ( cross - section @xmath1 pb ) producing microscopic black holes with a mass of the order of the neutrino - parton center - of - mass energy ( @xmath2 tev ) .",
    "the rest lifetime of these black holes is so small ( @xmath3  s ) that an instantaneous thermal and democratic decay can be assumed .",
    "the average decay multiplicity ( @xmath4 ) is a function of the parameters of the model ( planck mass @xmath5 , black hole mass @xmath6 , number of extra dimension @xmath7 ) and typical values of the order of @xmath8 are obtained in large regions of the parameter space .",
    "a large fraction of the decay products are hadrons ( @xmath9 ) but there is a non negligible number of charged leptons ( @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra of such leptons in the black hole centre - of - mass reference frame peaks around @xmath11 .",
    "the production of tau leptons in black hole decays , in particular the tau energy spectrum , was simulated using the charybdis generator  @xcite , while the black holes themselves were produced according to phase - space and without assuming an explicit @xmath12 cross - section , as explained in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "although the charybdis generator was developed to simulate the production and decay of black holes in hadron colliders , the careful treatment of the black hole decay made it quite useful for the purpose of the present study .",
    "some words about conventions and parameter setting in the charybdis generator are in order .",
    "the number of extra dimensions @xmath7 is constrained by existing observational data to be @xmath13 @xcite ( for example @xmath14 is immediately excluded @xcite since newton s law holds at solar system scales ) .",
    "we shall take @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but the conclusions apply equally well to higher dimensions .    at present , in the absence of a quantum theory of gravity , the only way to handle theoretically the black hole decay process is to consider black holes masses for which quantum gravity effects play a negligible role .",
    "this is the case for @xmath17 .",
    "we shall however relax this constraint and consider that a semi - classical description is valid for @xmath18 , as usually done in the literature . in this study",
    "we will consider @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "although the produced black hole could have higher mass than the minimal one ( depending on the impact parameter and the available centre - of - mass energy of the parton - parton collision ) , we work with fixed black hole masses , @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "this choice makes our results independent of the uncertainties on the extrapolation of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) to very high energies and on the computation model for the black hole production cross - section .",
    "furthermore , it is always possible to convolute the results , a posteriori , with a given @xmath6 spectrum .    when dealing with black holes , the only conserved parameters ( at least in 4 dimensions , @xmath22 ) are the total mass , angular momentum and electric charge .",
    "there is no lepton or baryon number conservation  @xcite , which is sometimes stated by saying that a black hole has no hair .",
    "the charybdis generator conserves electric charge and allows lepton number violation",
    ". it does conserve baryon number , which however should not be a major drawback @xcite .",
    "we note that there are several different definitions for the planck mass @xmath5 in the literature . here",
    "we shall define it by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is newton s constant on the @xmath25 universe .",
    "charybdis is interfaced with pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite for standard particle hadronisation and decay .",
    "the pythia option was selected in this study .",
    "for the termination of the decay , the charybdis flag kincut was set to false , with nbody=2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : charyb](a ) the multiplicity in black hole decays is shown for the scenario ( @xmath5=1  tev , @xmath7=3 ) , for different values of the black hole mass , @xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted that these distributions were , for illustration purposes , generated at fixed black hole masses , and should in general be convoluted with the mass spectrum of the produced black holes .",
    "while this mass spectrum is strongly peaked at the lowest possible values , the contribution from the high mass tail significantly affects the average multiplicitiy .",
    "this should be taken into account when comparing with the literature ( e.g. reference  @xcite ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : charyb](b ) and ( c ) show , for the same ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) scenario and several @xmath6 values , the number of expected tau leptons per event and the tau energy spectrum , respectively .",
    "these distributions have a moderate dependence on the ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) parameters and are mainly determined by the black hole mass , @xmath6 .",
    "induced tau lepton air - showers have been proposed as a `` golden '' signature for cosmic neutrino detection , and thus extensively studied  @xcite . in this context , the most interesting property of energetic tau leptons is their capability of going through ordinary matter , with long decay lengths and without important energy losses .",
    "in fact , in the relevant energy range , the tau interaction length in air is much higher than its decay length , which is given by @xmath26 km ( @xmath27 gev )  @xcite .",
    "this same property makes taus suitable for tagging microscopic black hole production in horizontal air shower events .",
    "a detectable second bang can be produced for tau leptons with a decay length large enough for the two bangs to be well separated , but small enough for a reasonable percentage of decays to occur within the field of view .",
    "this is of course determined by the tau energy and , as shown above ( see figure  [ fig : charyb ] ) tau leptons from black hole decays are expected to carry of the order of 1/10 of the black hole energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : taudec](a ) shows , for energies ranging from @xmath28 ev to @xmath29 ev , the distribution of the tau decay lengths .",
    "another critical aspect for the detectability of the second bang is the visible energy in the tau decay .",
    "taus can decay leptonicaly ( @xmath30 ) or hadronicaly ( @xmath31 ) . in both cases , a fraction of the energy escapes detection due to the presence of neutrinos . in figure",
    "[ fig : taudec](b ) the fraction of energy not associated to neutrinos in @xmath32 decays is shown . as observed , the average value of this energy , considering all decay modes , is of the order of 50% .",
    "hadronic decays produce a large amount of visible energy , which will be seen as an extensive air shower",
    ". for leptonic decays , not only the fraction of energy not associated to neutrinos is lower , but also only decays into electrons originate extensive air showers , leading to observable fluorescence signals .",
    "summarising , once a first bang is observed , the detectability of the second bang is basically determined by the tau lepton energy , which determines both the tau decay length and the energy of the second shower .",
    "the key characteristics of cosmic ray experiments are thus the field of view and the energy threshold .",
    "the observation of double bang events with two showers separated by tens or hundreds of kilometers represents an important challenge to the next generation of large - scale cosmic rays experiments .",
    "the detection of the fluorescence light produced by the development of an uhecr shower in the atmosphere is a well suited technique  @xcite to measure the longitudinal shower profile .",
    "it has however two severe limitations : the very low efficiency of the energy conversion to fluorescence photons , and the atmosphere attenuation length .",
    "the first constrain restrains the application of such technique to the detection of very high energy showers in low background conditions ( moonless nights ) .",
    "threshold energies around @xmath29  ev or @xmath33  ev have been quoted for auger  @xcite and euso @xcite , respectively .",
    "the second constrain applies mainly to the earth - based experiments ( auger ) , as the path of the fluorescence photons to space - based experiments is usually below one attenuation length . in space based experiments ,",
    "not only these attenuation effects are less critical but also a larger number of black hole induced events is typically expected , due to the larger acceptance  @xcite .",
    "this makes space - based experiments more promising for the detection of the double - bang signature events .    in the following paragraphs euso",
    "will be taken as a case study , without however making any detailed simulation .",
    "in fact , double bang events were generated parameterising the shower development and the atmosphere response , in a model implemented in mathematica  @xcite .",
    "this approach was inspired in the method presented in the description of the slast simulation  @xcite .",
    "the gil parameterisation  @xcite was used for the longitudinal shower development , while fluorescence yield follows reference  @xcite .",
    "attenuation in the atmosphere was included using tables produced with lowtran  @xcite .",
    "a cross - check with reference plots for euso  @xcite at the detector entrance was made and a reasonable agreement ( 10 - 20@xmath34 ) was obtained .",
    "the results obtained must thus be considered as an order of magnitude computation . to translate these results to owl  @xcite an increase by a factor of five in expected event rates",
    "can be considered  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : longprof ] , the longitudinal fluorescence profile of a double bang event at the entrance of euso is shown as an example .",
    "the observation window for the double bang events is constrained by geometrical considerations ( the two showers must be inside the field of view ) and by the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the reconstruction of the second shower , which has an energy one order of magnitude lower than the first one , is a critical issue .",
    "however , the energy threshold for this second shower is only determined by the expected number of signal and background photons in a very restricted region of the field of view , as the second shower must be aligned with the direction of the first one .    in figure",
    "[ fig : conflevel ] the confidence level ( cl ) for observing the second shower is shown as a function of the shower visible energy , for horizontal showers at different altitudes .",
    "the modified frequentist likelihood ratio method  @xcite , which takes into account not only the total number of expected signal and background events but also the shapes of the distributions , was used .",
    "signal events were obtained using the method described above . the number of background photons has been estimated considering an expected background rate of 300 - 500 photons/(m@xmath35.ns.sr )  @xcite ( corresponding to about 0.5 - 0.7 photoelectrons per pixel in the euso focal surface in a time interval of 2.5@xmath36s  @xcite ) and assuming a flat distribution .",
    "an ideal photon detection efficiency of 1.0 and a more realistic one of 0.1 were considered .",
    "horizontal incoming neutrinos at different heights were generated , with the horizontal coordinates of the point of first interaction randomly distributed inside the euso field of view .",
    "a cl of 99.7% ( 3@xmath37 ) was chosen as the criterion of visibility of the second shower .",
    "threshold energies as low as @xmath38 ev ( @xmath39 ev ) can be obtained for a photon detection efficiency of 0.1 ( 1.0 ) and a shower height of 10 km .",
    "the height is an important parameter , as the number of detected fluorescence photons increases with the height .",
    "a factor of 20 variation in the number of detected photons can be obtained between two similar showers at low ( @xmath403 km ) and high ( @xmath4020 km ) height .    to study the visibility of double bang events in euso ,",
    "black holes produced by horizontal incoming neutrinos were generated , @xmath12 , and decayed ( see section  [ sec : bang1 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal coordinates of the point of first interaction were randomly distributed within the field of view , and the shower height was randomly chosen according to the density profile .",
    "the energy of the shower resulting from the black hole decay ( first bang ) was computed and tau leptons originated from this decay were followed and decayed ( second bang ) .",
    "the visibility of the tau decay shower was established using the cl criterion described above .",
    "the fraction of black hole events with an observable second shower is shown in figure  [ fig : results ] , as a function of the primary neutrino energy , for ( @xmath5=1  tev , @xmath7=3,@xmath6=5  tev ) , and for detector efficiencies of 1.0 and 0.1 .",
    "these results take into account the fraction of events with taus in black hole decays , the tau energy spectrum and its decay length , the geometrical acceptance of euso and the visibility of the second shower . for a detector efficiency of 0.1 ( 1 . ) , at @xmath41  ev , of the order of 2% ( 5% ) of the black hole induced events with a black hole decay visible in euso ( first bang ) are expected to have a visible second bang .",
    "the expected number of double bang events detectable in euso is limited at the lower neutrino energies by the shower visibility and at the highest by the tau lepton decay length . for relatively low energies",
    "the main limiting factor is the energy of the second bang and , in the figure , the curves corresponding to the two detector efficiencies are far apart .",
    "as the energy increases , the tau decay length increases and the second bang often escapes detection , and the curve corresponding to an efficiency of 1.0 drops considerably . on the other hand , for an efficiency of 0.1 , the favourable effect of the increase of the second bang energy is still dominant , and the two curves approach .",
    "different values of @xmath6 can lead to important changes in these results , as the black hole decay multiplicity and the tau energy spectrum are strongly dependent on @xmath6 ( see section  [ sec : bang1 ] ) .",
    "the dependence on the ( @xmath5,@xmath7 ) parameters was found to be small .",
    "the rate of black hole induced events depends strongly on the assumed cosmogenic and extragalactic neutrino fluxes .",
    "values ranging from several tens to hundreds of events per year , for @xmath5 = 1 tev , have been predicted for the owl telescope @xcite . in the same reference",
    "the acceptance of euso was estimated to be @xmath42 of owl s .    in euso ,",
    "the expected rate of double bang events due to black hole production is therefore small .",
    "however , the observation of just a few such events would be of the utmost importance , as almost no standard physics process has this signature .",
    "the most dangerous background comes from the @xmath43 regeneration in the earth atmosphere ( @xmath44 )  @xcite , which would be , in itself , a very interesting observation .",
    "however , in this type of events the second shower is expected to be more energetic than the first one .",
    "other new physics channels may lead to similar signatures , but the observation of a reasonable number of events would give some discriminating power between different models , through the measurement of the energies of the two showers and of the distance between them .    in the case of auger",
    "the field of view is smaller , and the observable decay lengths are restricted to about 30 km if the combination of two fluorescence eyes is considered . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower energy threshold would allow the exploration of a lower neutrino energy window ( @xmath45 ev ) if the expected neutrino fluxes and/or the expected cross - section are higher than the values usually quoted .",
    "the next generation of large cosmic ray experiments ( auger , euso , owl ) may have access to events with a double bang topology , an almost background free signature .",
    "this signature was explored in the framework of the production of microscopic black holes in the interaction of uhecr in the atmosphere .",
    "euso , which has an intermediate field of view between auger and owl , was taken as a case study .",
    "the studies presented in this paper show that it is possible to reconstruct second bang showers above an energy threshold which is much lower than the one required to trigger on the first one .",
    "this requires that , once a very inclined shower trigger occurs , the portion of the field of view where the second bang may occur ( aligned with the first shower ) is also readout . in this conditions , it is shown that the second bang observation probability , once the first bang is observed , can be of the order of a few % .",
    "the predicted rates of double bang events are , in the case of euso , small and strongly dependent on the expected neutrino fluxes and on the computed cross - sections , both with large uncertainties .",
    "however , the discovery potential of such events is so high that the next generation of cosmic ray experiments should consider them in their performance studies and in the optimisation of their trigger and readout systems .      n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos and g. dvali , phys .",
