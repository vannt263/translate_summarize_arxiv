    "in the 1960 s , @xmath0 ehrhart ( @xcite,@xcite ) proved that given a @xmath1-dimensional compact simplicial complex in @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , denoted here generically by @xmath4 , whose vertices are in the lattice @xmath5 , there exists a polynomial @xmath6 $ ] of degree @xmath1 , associated with @xmath4 , satisfying    @xmath7    it is known that    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the euler characteristic of @xmath4 , and @xmath10 is the surface area of @xmath4 normalized with respect to the sublattice on each face of @xmath4 .    in @xcite",
    ", @xmath11 ehrhart has classified the regular convex polyhedra in @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that only cubes , regular tetrahedrons and regular octahedrons can be embedded in the usual integer lattice .",
    "we arrived at the same result in @xcite using a construction of these polyhedrons from equilateral triangles , and this is how we got interested in this line of questioning .",
    "this led us to the following simple description of all cubes in @xmath12 .",
    "one takes an odd positive integer , say @xmath1 , and a primitive solution of the diophantine equation @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there are equilateral triangles in any plane having equation @xmath15 , which can be parameterized in terms of two integers @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the side - lengths of such a triangle are equal to @xmath18 . in order to rise in space from such a triangle to form a regular tetrahedron",
    ", one needs to have satisfied the necessary condition    @xmath19    parenthetically speaking we remind the reader about carroll lewis ",
    "conjecture on having infinitely many triples of pythagorean triangles of equal area .",
    "the answer to that problem was to take solutions of ( [ carrollewiscondition ] ) and construct triangles with sides @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 having @xmath23 .",
    "this does nt seem to be that strange of a coincidence , given the number of diophantine equations that one need to solved in both cases .",
    "however , we could not find a reason of having ( [ carrollewiscondition ] ) as a sufficient condition .",
    "if ( [ carrollewiscondition ] ) is satisfied , there are two possibilities . if @xmath24 is a multiple of @xmath25 , then one can complete the triangle in both sides of the plane to a regular tetrahedron in @xmath12 , and if @xmath24 is not divisible by @xmath25 , then one can complete the triangle in exactly one side to form a regular tetrahedron in @xmath12 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "every such regular tetrahedron can then be completed to a cube in @xmath12 with side - lengths equal to @xmath26 .",
    "every regular octahedron in @xmath12 is the dual of the double of a cube in @xmath12 .",
    "we are going to make these constructions a little more specific in the last section .",
    "[ fig1 ]    it is natural to ask the question that we think ehrhart himself asked : ",
    "what is the form that the polynomial in ( [ ehrhartpolynomial ] ) takes for these regular lattice polyhedra ? \" .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question for cubes ( in a very simple way ) , and for regular tetrahedrons and octahedrons , the only such regular polyhedra in @xmath12 .    for completeness and due credit ,",
    "we include ehrhart s idea in @xcite to characterize all cubes in @xmath12 .",
    "this was based on a theorem of olinde rodrigues :    _ the set of 3-by-3 orthogonal matrices can be given by four real parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath1 , not simultaneously zero , as follows : _",
    "@xmath30.\\ ] ]    it is clear that every cube in @xmath12 can be translated so that a vertex becomes the origin and the three vectors defined by the three sides starting from the origin give an orthogonal basis for @xmath31 .",
    "hence , one can construct a 3-by-3 orthogonal matrix from these vectors which has rational entries .",
    "conversely , one can construct a cube in @xmath12 from such an orthogonal matrix which has rational entries . in what follows",
    "we will do this association so that the vectors ( points ) are determined by the rows .",
    "the construction here is to take four integers @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 in ( [ olinderodrigues ] ) , simplify by whatever is possible and then get rid of the denominators to obtain the three vectors with integer coordinates that determine the cube .",
    "this construction is similar to the classical parametrization of the heronian triangles .",
    "our approach to the classification allows us to start in terms of the side lengths",
    ". however , ehrhart s construction is useful in answering other questions about these objects .",
    "for instance , one can see that there are such cubes of any side length ( other than the trivial ones , multiples of the unit cube ) since every natural number can be written as a sum of four perfect squares .",
    "it turns out that there are only odd number side lengths for irreducible cubes , i.e. a cube which is not an integer multiple of a smaller cube in @xmath12 .",
    "let us begin with some of the smallest irreducible cubes .",
    "we introduced then here by orthogonal matrices with rational entries and defined up to the usual symmetries of the space ( equivalent classes modulo the 48-order subgroup of all orthogonal matrices with entries @xmath32 or @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath34 ) . as we mentioned before , and this will make a difference , the cubes are essentially determined by the rows . obviously , the ehrhart polynomials are identical for all cubes in the same equivalence class",
    ".    we will denote the ehrhart polynomial for an irreducible cube @xmath35 of side - length @xmath36 , @xmath37 , by @xmath38 . from the general theory we must have    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is half the sum of the areas of the faces of the cube @xmath35 , each face being normalized by the area of a fundamental domain of the sublattice contained in that face .",

    "@xmath51    this suggests that @xmath52    we can easily prove that this is indeed the case for cubes of a special form , like @xmath53 and @xmath54 above . let us consider a primitive pythagorean triple @xmath55 , with @xmath56 . in the @xmath57-plane",
