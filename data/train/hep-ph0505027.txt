    "a very common alternative to solve some of the problems of the standard model ( sm ) consists on enlarging the gauge symmetry .",
    "for instance , the @xmath6  grand unification model of georgi and glashow @xcite can unify the interactions and predicts the electric charge quantization ; while the group @xmath7 can also unifies the interactions and might explain the masses of the neutrinos @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such models can not explain the origin of the fermion families .",
    "some models with larger symmetries address this problem @xcite . a very interesting alternative to explain the origin of generations comes from the cancellation of chiral anomalies @xcite .",
    "in particular , models with gauge symmetry @xmath8 also called 331 models , arise as a possible solution to this puzzle , where the three families are required in order to cancel chiral anomalies completely .",
    "an additional motivation to study these kind of models comes from the fact that they can also predict the charge quantization for a three family model even when neutrino masses are added @xcite .",
    "although cancellation of anomalies leads to some required conditions fourteen , such criterion alone still permits an infinite number of 331 models . in these models ,",
    "the electric charge is defined in general as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group @xmath9as it has been studied in the literature @xcite , the value of the @xmath10 parameter determines the fermion assignment , and more specifically , the electric charges of the exotic spectrum .",
    "hence , it is customary to use this quantum number to classify the different 331 models .",
    "if we want to avoid exotic charges we are led to only two different models i.e. @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it has been recently obtained in ref @xcite constraints to 331 models by examining the scalar sector . in summary , these constraints are obtained by requiring gauge invariance in the yukawa sector and finding the possible vacuum alignment structures that respect the symmetry breaking pattern and provides the fermions and gauge bosons of the sm with the appropriate masses . by applying gauge invariance to the yukawa lagrangian it is found that the higgs bosons should lie in either a triplet , antitriplet , singlet or sextet representation of @xmath12 . on the other hand , cancellation of chiral anomalies",
    "demands that the number of fermionic triplets and antitriplets must be equal @xcite .",
    "moreover , assuming the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath13 @xmath14 we see that one triplet is necessary for the first symmetry breaking and two triplets for the second in order to give mass to the up and down quark sector . in some cases it is necessary to introduce a scalar sextet to give masses to the neutrinos ten .",
    "the group structure of these models leads , along with the sm neutral boson @xmath15 to the prediction of an additional current associated with a new neutral boson @xmath16 unlike @xmath0-boson whose couplings are family independent and the weak interactions at low energy are of universal character , the couplings of @xmath17 are different for the three families due to the @xmath18 values to each of them . through the @xmath19 mixing it is possible to study the low energy deviations of the @xmath0 couplings to the sm families @xcite . in the quark sector",
    "each 331-family in the weak basis can be assigned in three different ways into mass eigenstates . in this way in a phenomenological analysis , the allowed region associated with the @xmath19 mixing angle and",
    "the physical mass @xmath20 of the extra neutral boson will depend on the family assignment to the mass states .",
    "in this work we report a phenomenological study through a @xmath1 fit at the @xmath0-pole to find the allowed region for the mixing angle between the neutral gauge bosons @xmath19 and the mass of the @xmath21 boson at 95% cl for three different assignments of the quark families mohapatra .",
    "we take into account the two main versions of the 331 models from the literature @xcite , which correspond to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:331-spectrum ] is devoted to summarize the fermion , scalar and vector boson representations . in section [ sec : neutral - currents ] we describe the neutral currents and the vector and axial vector couplings of the model . in section sec : z - pole we perform the @xmath24 analysis at the z - pole including atomic parity violation at 95% cl .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the fermionic spectrum under @xmath25 @xmath26 is shown in table [ tab : espectro ] for three families with @xmath27 and @xmath28 where the first case contains the long model @xcite and the second contains the bilepton model proposed by pisano , pleitez and frampton @xcite .",
    "we recognize three different possibilities to assign the physical quarks in each family representation as it is shown in table [ tab : combination ] . at low energy , the three models from table [",
    "tab : combination ] are equivalent and there are not any phenomenological feature that allow us to detect differences between them .",
    "in fact , they must reduce to the sm which is an universal family model in @xmath29 however , through the couplings of the three families to the additional neutral current ( @xmath17 ) and the introduction of a mixing angle between @xmath0 and @xmath17 it is possible to recognize differences among the three models at the electroweak scale .",
    "it is noted that although we write the spectrum in the weak basis in table [ tab : espectro ] , we can consider three realizations in the mass basis in table [ tab : combination ] .",
