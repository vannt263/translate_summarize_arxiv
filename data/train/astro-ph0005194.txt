    "the dynamical behavior of dwarf spheroidals and other satellites of the milky way holds much information pertinent to the dark - matter problem .",
    "attempts to elicit such knowledge include , on the one hand , measurements of the satellites intrinsic properties such as the size , luminosity , and velocity dispersion , which evince mass discrepancies in the satellites ( @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy is removed in the modified dynamics ",
    "mond ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the satellites can be used to probe the gravitational field of their mother galaxy ( specifically , the milky way ) by using them as test particles to probe the galaxy s potential field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by studying tidal effects of the galaxy on the structure of the satellite taken as a finite body ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in newtonian dynamics , the history of the center - of - mass motion may influence the internal workings of the satellite via tidal effects .",
    "tidal disruption may have culled from the satellite population those that are internally weakly bound and/or move on elongated orbits , thus affecting the distribution of galactic orbits seen today ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in mond ,",
    "the interaction between the internal and center - of - mass motions , brought about by the theory s nonlinearity , goes beyond the newtonian effects . for small systems ( smaller than the scale over which the external field varies )",
    "the effect goes in one direction : while the center - of - mass motion is not affected by the internal motions , it may strongly affect them as explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this occurs when the accelerations inside the satellite are of the order of or smaller than its center - of - mass acceleration ; it is also required that the internal accelerations be small compared with the acceleration constant of mond , @xmath2 , as is always the case for the milky way s dwarf satellites . due to this external - field effect ( efe ) a satellite that plunges into the galaxy on an eccentric orbit increases in size , making itself an easier victim for tidal disruption .",
    "an additional destructive effect results when the changes in the external field become resonant with the internal motions .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to describe , and demonstrate the pertinence , of these processes , which are peculiar to mond .    in the next section we briefly recapitulate the external field effect .",
    "next , in section 3 , we consider a dwarf on an elongated orbit , delineating the different regimes of application of the mond effects , and give an analytic description of dynamics in the adiabatic regime . in section 4",
    "we describe the mond n - body simulations , the results of which are described in section 5 .",
    "section 6 lists our conclusions and briefly comments on the milky way s dwarf satellites .",
    "we work with the formulation of mond as modified gravity described in @xcite whereby the poisson equation for the nonrelativistic gravitational potential is replaced by [ fe]= 4g[field ] ( and the gravitational acceleration is given by @xmath3 ) . for a small system , freely falling in an external field that dominates its own , equation([fe ] ) can be linearized in the internal field , expanding about the value of the external acceleration @xmath4 ( approximately constant over the extent of the small system ) . as shown in @xcite one",
    "gets a quasi - newtonian internal dynamics with an effective gravitational constant @xmath5 .",
    "we use the term `` quasi - newtonian '' because , in addition to the increased effective gravitational constant , the dynamics is anisotropic with some dilation along the direction of the external field .",
    "if the external field is in the @xmath6 direction then the linearized equation reduces to the poisson equation in the coordinates @xmath7 , where @xmath8/dln(s)$ ] at @xmath9 takes a value between 0 and 1 . in the deep - mond limit [ @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , assumed all along in this paper",
    ", we then have = ga_0/g_exg , [ zuma ] and @xmath12 .",
    "mond s basic premise is that our galaxy , like others , does not contain dynamically important dark matter .",
    "thus , as long as the orbit of the satellite under consideration does not take it within a few scale lengths of the mother galaxy , the latter may be treated as a point mass . even within galaxies",
    "the mean accelerations never much exceed @xmath2 ; at large galactocentric distances the acceleration is always smaller than @xmath2 , as we assume all along .",
    "the mond - limit acceleration at a distance @xmath0 from a point mass @xmath13 is g(r ) = v_^2/r , [ dosta ] where @xmath14 is the asymptotic , circular - orbit speed .",
    "this @xmath15 is the external acceleration field @xmath4 that enters the quasi - newtonian internal dynamics of the dwarf on the sections of its orbit where @xmath15 outweighs the internal accelerations .",
    "if along some portion of the dwarf s orbit the change in the external field is slow  i.e .",
    ", occurs on time scales long compared with the internal dynamical time  the quantity @xmath16 is expected to remain constant as an adiabatic invariant . here",
    "@xmath17 is some mean internal velocity , and @xmath18 is the mean radius of the system .",
    "also , in the quasi - newtonian regime an effective , newtonian virial relation should hold : @xmath19 . as @xmath0 varies along this section of the orbit , and with it @xmath20 , we expect @xmath17 and @xmath18 to follow according to @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . as the dwarf plunges in on an eccentric orbit it puffs up  an effect that does not appear in newtonian dynamics with dark matter  thus rendering itself more susceptible to tidal breakup than it would be due to the increasing external - field gradients alone .    to consider more quantitatively the interplay between adiabaticity , external - field dominance , and tidal breakup ,",
    "consider a satellite described by its gross properties : the ( baryonic ) mass @xmath23 , the root - mean - square velocity of the constituents with respect to the center - of - mass @xmath17 , and the size @xmath18 ( say the rms distance of constituents from the center ) .",
    "it moves on an orbit @xmath24 with velocity @xmath25 in the field of the point - like mother galaxy of mass @xmath13 .",
    "( we neglect the secondary effects of anisotropy and so we only consider the magnitude of the position vector @xmath26 . )",
    "the parameter v^2/rg(r)= v^2 r /v^2_r [ beta ] measures the importance of the internal acceleration vis - a - vis the external one .",
    "the efe is pertinent when @xmath27 . in terms of the radii and masses",
    "we can write [ klata ] here we used newtonian expressions with @xmath20 from eq.([zuma ] ) when @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter ( r / v_)/(r / v ) = ( r / r)^1/2 ^ 1/2 [ alpha ] is useful for measuring the degree of adiabaticity ( achieved when @xmath29 ) when the orbit is mildly eccentric , because then the orbital changes occur on a time scale @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "( the mond potential far from a central mass is logarithmic , for which the virial relation reads @xmath32 .",
    "the velocities at perigalacticon , @xmath33 , and apogalacticon , @xmath34 , are related by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the respective distances . )",
    "we can write [ ktupa ] because only @xmath38 is of interest , we see from eq.([alpha ] ) that @xmath39 in the whole region @xmath40 .",
    "tidal effects in the bulk are important when the mean internal acceleration , @xmath41 , is smaller than the increment of the external acceleration over the extent @xmath18 ; i.e. , when @xmath42 .",
    "we take as the criterion for the importance of tidal effects ^1/3=(vr",
    "/ v_r)^2/3 1 .",
    "[ matut ] again , since only cases for which @xmath43 are of interest we see that tidal effects need concern us only when @xmath44 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "in this regime we have @xmath45 .",
    "note in general that @xmath46 .",
    "this means that non - adiabaticity and tidal effects enter at about the same place on the orbit , as is indeed verified in our numerical calculations .",
    "clearly , the inflation of the satellite due to the efe continues in the tidal phase .",
    "we can now qualitatively see what happens to a dwarf on an elongated orbit .",
    "if the entire orbit has @xmath47 the satellite is unaffected by the galaxy . if its orbit takes it to a small enough galactocentric distance @xmath48 where @xmath49 the efe enters into action there . at this point",
    "the situation is adiabatic with @xmath50 , which is @xmath51 for the typical value of @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases further we are , at first , in the adiabatic regime with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 decreasing still below 1 : @xmath56 . in this region",
    "@xmath57 from eq.([ktupa ] ) , so roughly at @xmath58 adiabaticity is lost , and at the same time tidal effects set in , in which case we have to resort to mond , n - body calculations , as described below .",
    "the comparison of the mond predictions on the onset of tidal effects with those of newtonian dynamics ( nd ) ( with dark matter ) depends on what exactly is measured , and on what is assumed in nd ( e.g. , on the dark - matter distribution in the dwarf ) .",
    "but , in any event , the puffing up of a dwarf in the @xmath59 region , which has no analogue in nd , makes dwarfs more vulnerable to tidal disruption . to take a specific example ,",
    "suppose a satellite is observed at @xmath60 with measured size , internal , and center - of - mass velocities .",
    "its future orbit can then be deduced , and also the newtonian , dynamical mass it contains , @xmath61 .",
    "suppose it is already in the @xmath59 regime .",
    "it is easy to see that the value of its tidal parameter @xmath62 as deduced in nd is the same as that given by mond , since @xmath63 and the galactic mass within @xmath64 is @xmath65 . as we saw",
    ", mond predicts that @xmath66 , while newtonian dynamics predicts @xmath67 , since @xmath18 is then assumed to remain constant while @xmath68 .",
    "so tidal effects will clearly enter at larger radii in mond .",
    "the numerical simulations involve a model dwarf comprising n identical particles that starts with some equilibrium distribution function in compliance with mond dynamics . the model is then subjected to different types of variable external influences that mimic aspects of the influence of the mother galaxy .",
    "the underlying potential field equation is eq.([field ] ) , or its linearized , approximate form .",
    "this nonlinear potential equation is solved numerically using multi - grid methods as detailed in @xcite and adumbrated in @xcite .",
    "the particles are then propagated in the derived potential .",
    "it is only interesting to study the dwarf when it is in the external - field - dominated region . to isolate the different effects discussed above we proceed in three steps",
    "first , to pinpoint the effects of non - adiabaticity , and verify our analytic deductions for the adiabatic regime , we start with a quasi - newtonian king model for the dwarf , assume quasi - newtonian dynamics , and simply vary @xmath20 periodically and see how the model reacts for different frequencies of the perturbation . in the second step we still consider a quasi - newtonian behavior but the applied variations in @xmath20 and the direction of the external field correspond to actual orbits of a dwarf . the third stage , which is more costly , is to simulate the complete system of dwarf plus a point - mass galaxy . since the construction of initial models for the dwarf are peculiar to mond we describe them briefly now , referring the reader for more details to @xcite .",
    "we use as initial states king models ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) properly modified to constitute , as the case may require , quasi - newtonian or deep - mond steady states .",
    "the distribution function for the newtonian models is [ kingdf ] f_k = where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the parameter @xmath71 is the upper energy cutoff .",
    "equation([kingdf ] ) is integrated over velocities to obtain the density @xmath72 as a function of the relative potential @xmath73 . instead of the poisson equation",
    "we solve here the spherically symmetric mond equation ( in the deep - mond limit assumed all along ) : [ poiss ] [ a_0 ^ -1r^2 ( )^2]=-4g_k ( ) ( the apostrophe signifies derivative with respect to @xmath18 ) , which provides an ordinary differential equation for @xmath74 that can be integrated numerically with the boundary condition @xmath75 .",
    "the second boundary condition is @xmath76 , which together with @xmath77 determines the model .",
    "the model can also be specified in terms of other parameters from among the tidal radius @xmath78 , the total mass , the central density @xmath79 , and the king radius @xmath80 .",
    "note that for mond king models @xmath81 defined in this way is not some characteristic radius ; it is just a convenient representation of @xmath82 ( so we can have @xmath83 , for example ) .    in constructing a quasi - newtonian model",
    "we remember that the transformed potential @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , with @xmath86/dln(s)$ ] , satisfies the usual poisson equation with @xmath20 as gravitational constant , and @xmath87 as density ( @xmath6 is taken in the direction of the external field ) .",
    "we thus begin by constructing a newtonian model in the auxiliary coordinates @xmath88 remembering that the conserved quantity on which the distribution function depends by the jeans theorem is @xmath89/2   +    \\phi'(x',y',z')$ ] .",
    "this model has a spherical mass distribution , but a @xmath90 dispersion that is smaller by a factor @xmath91 than those in the other directions .",
    "we draw positions and velocities for the auxiliary coordinates of the n particles .",
    "then we multiply all @xmath92 and @xmath90 values by @xmath91 .",
    "the total mass of the model is multiplied by the same factor because @xmath93 .",
    "the resulting model is elongated in the @xmath6 direction and has an isotropic global velocity distribution .",
    "we first want to establish the consequences of the external - field effect and learn what is the time scale necessary for a change to be adiabatic .",
    "as was discussed in section [ orbit ] , in the adiabatic regime we expect the average velocity in a system , @xmath17 , to be proportional to @xmath94 , and the average size of the system to be inversely proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "we start with a newtonian king model having @xmath95 particles with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "we also take @xmath99 [ this fixes @xmath79 ; the total mass of the newtonian model is then @xmath100 , and its tidal radius @xmath101 .",
    "we then perform the stretching by @xmath102 ( we take @xmath103 for the deep - mond limit ) to get a model with @xmath104 and root - mean - square values of the coordinate and velocity components ( designated by capital letters ) @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "the natural dynamical time @xmath108 is of order unity .",
    "we ran simulations on a cubical grids with @xmath109 grid points using the quasi - newtonian field equation with a fixed time step @xmath110 for @xmath111 time steps .",
    "we varied @xmath20 periodically with time taking @xmath112 for three values of @xmath113 .",
    "( the physical grid spacing is changed in proportion to @xmath114 during the simulation , since we expect @xmath18 to scale as @xmath114 . ) in analogy with the adiabaticity parameter , @xmath115 , defined locally on an orbit , we can define here as some global measure of adiabaticity @xmath116 $ ] , where @xmath117 is the period .",
    "for the three models presented @xmath118 respectively .",
    "the results of these simulations for the @xmath119 components are shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) describing how the extent and velocity dispersion in the @xmath119 direction vary with time .",
    "the results for the @xmath6 direction are the same within a few percents .",
    "the results for @xmath120 show the expected external - field effect with strict adiabaticity ; small departures from adiabaticity appear in the time dependence of the size and mean velocity for @xmath121 ; while for @xmath122 clear departure from adiabaticity is evident .",
    "we also learn that departure from adiabaticity brings about a secular increase in the radius and decrease in the internal velocities .      before going to the more complete models that utilize the full mond field equation and include the tidal forces , we follow the evolution of a quasi - newtonian model varying the value of @xmath20 and the direction of the external field according to the location of the dwarf on an actual orbit in the logarithmic potential of the point - mass mother galaxy .",
    "tidal forces are then not taken into account .",
    "the purpose of these experiments is to test the degree to which the changes in dwarf characteristics are adiabatic for sample models with realistic parameters . in particular , to see what lasting effects non - adiabaticity near perigalacticon has on the dwarf in disjunction from tidal effects .",
    "we thus took orbits with strong adiabaticity at apogalacticon , where we start , but a breakdown of adiabaticity near perigalacticon .",
    "note that @xmath20 goes back to the same value at subsequent apogalacticons ; so , apart from some remaining oscillations on the dynamical time scale , the virial relation is reestablished in the mean , and , thus , @xmath123 must come back to the same value .",
    "we take the mass of the mother galaxy as unit , @xmath124 . since we also use units",
    "in which @xmath99 and @xmath125 , the unit of velocities becomes @xmath126 , which in cgs units is about @xmath127 for the mw .",
    "length is then measured in units of @xmath128 , about 10 kpc for the mw . in these units",
    "the mw satellites are typically at distances between 5 and 20 , of size @xmath129 to @xmath130 , velocity dispersion @xmath131 to @xmath132 , and of mass @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "accordingly , we construct our dwarf model as a quasi - newtonian king model having the following properties : @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 ( before stretching ) , and @xmath139 .",
    "we simulated its evolution for two orbits with pericenter and apocenter distances of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath140 , @xmath142 . at galactocentric distance",
    "@xmath0 the external acceleration is @xmath1 ( in our units of @xmath2 ) , and @xmath143 .",
    "the results of the simulations are summarized in figures ( [ fig2])([fig3 ] ) .",
    "adiabaticity is more severely violated in the second model , which has @xmath142 .",
    "we see that , as a result of violating adiabaticity near @xmath144 , the dwarf still oscillates on the dynamical time scale when it next enters the adiabatic regime around apocenter .",
    "more importantly , it attains a larger radius ( averaged over the fluctuations ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion is correspondingly smaller ( @xmath123 is preserved and @xmath16 is larger ) . on the next close passage the dwarf will be even less adiabatic and becomes more vulnerable and will continue to increase in size .",
    "we then followed the full evolution of a dwarf obeying mond orbiting a point mother galaxy .",
    "we started by producing an isolated mond king model with the following parameters : @xmath145 , @xmath146 ( remember that @xmath81 is just a proxy for @xmath82 , not a characteristic radius ) , and @xmath137 .",
    "the resulting model has a total mass @xmath147 and a tidal radius @xmath148 .",
    "note that @xmath149 is not the mean velocity dispersion of the mond model .",
    "this can be gotten from the deep - mond virial relation ( @xcite ) , which in our units reads @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the three - dimensional rms velocity .",
    "so we get for the one - dimensional rms velocity @xmath152 .",
    "these global parameters are similar to the ones of the quasi - newtonian model we have used in the previous subsection , but the density profiles of the two models differ : the mond model is less concentrated than the quasi - newtonian model .",
    "our model dwarf is put on an eccentric orbit starting at an apogalacticon distance of @xmath142 and reaching a perigalacticon distance of @xmath140 . from the above model",
    "we construct a family of five models by scaling up the mass of the model ending up with masses @xmath23 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , and scaling the velocity dispersions up accordingly .",
    "these are all models for isolated mond dwarfs . however , at apocenter already we have to start with models under some external - field influence .",
    "so , before we let the models evolve along the orbit we need to switch on adiabatically the external field .",
    "this is done in a preliminary simulation where we gradually increase the mass of the mother galaxy from zero to one .",
    "the presence of the mother galaxy enters these simulations through the boundary conditions used by the potential solver .",
    "the @xmath156 model hardly changes when the external field is switched on , while for the @xmath23 model the rms radius , @xmath18 , increases by as much as @xmath157 when the external field is switched on . the values for the parameter @xmath55 , which measures the ratio of the internal field to the external field , calculated at @xmath158",
    "are @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "thus , the @xmath23 model is dominated by the external field while the @xmath154 is the borderline case .",
    "we then integrate the internal dynamics and the center - of - mass motion of each of the models on the orbit .",
    "the orbits lie in the @xmath164,@xmath165 plane and we start at @xmath166 , @xmath167 . the simulations lasted for 40 time units and consisted of @xmath111 individual time steps .",
    "the rms value of @xmath18 and @xmath17 as functions of time are given in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "also shown there are the adiabaticity ( @xmath115 ) and the tidal ( @xmath62 ) parameters along the orbit .",
    "projections of the dwarf structure for the four smaller - mass models , on the @xmath168 plane , are given in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath55 at pericenter for the five models was : @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "the three models with masses @xmath23 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 show clear signs of tidal disruption .",
    "the @xmath23 model seems to have been totally destroyed by the tidal forces and there is no clear core that remained after the passage near the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath153 model was strongly influenced by the tidal forces and lost about @xmath174 of its mass .",
    "the @xmath154 model lost only a few percent of its mass through tidal interaction .",
    "we can attribute these mass losses to the combined action of tidal forces and the extra non - adiabatic expansion of the models near @xmath144 .    in comparison ,",
    "newtonian dynamics applied to dwarfs observed with the same initial positions , center - of - mass velocities , sizes , and velocity dispersions would predict much less tidal disruption .",
    "consider , in particular , the two most vulnerable models with masses @xmath23 and @xmath153 .",
    "they start at @xmath158 with @xmath175 , so , from the discussion at the end of section 3 we see that their newtonian @xmath62 values there are the same as the mond values .",
    "( of course , a newtonist will assume that they contain more mass for the same sizes and velocity dispersions . ) from figure 4 we see that the two models start with @xmath176 respectively .",
    "the mond scaling ( @xmath66 for @xmath28 ) implies that the two models should have @xmath177 at perigalacticon , @xmath178 , as they approximately do . in newtonian dynamics , where @xmath67 , we would get at perigalacticon @xmath179 for the two models , making these initial model dwarfs much safer from later tidal disruption . it need perhaps be clarified that the newtonist will continue to get the same @xmath62 values as in mond if he uses at every point the observed properties , but this will lead him to conclude that the mass of the dwarf varies . here",
    "we speak of what the newtonist s predictions will be given only the initial data , and assuming that the dwarf mass is constant .",
    "we have studied the existence , the nature , and the influence on dwarf satellites of the external field effect in mond . for dwarf parameters in the efe regime",
    "two situation are grossly distinguished : a ) the adiabatic regime , in which tidal effects are not so important and b ) the impulsive region , which also roughly coincides with the region where tidal forces become important . due to the efe",
    "the radius of a dwarf in the adiabatic regime increases as it approaches the mother galaxy .",
    "if the whole orbit is in the adiabatic regime , the structure of the dwarf simply changes periodically with the orbital period . if , however , some segment of the orbit is in the impulsive - tidal regime near pericenter , then the dwarf might lose much of its mass there . even if it does not , it can emerge from this region having a larger radius and smaller velocity dispersion ( hence , a longer intrinsic dynamical time ) . in its next approach",
    "to perigalacticon it will thus enter the impulsive - tidal regime at a larger distance from the center .    clearly , all the above is highly germane to the dwarf system of the mw .",
    "the distribution of intrinsic and orbital parameters of presently observed dwarfs must have been greatly affected by interaction with the mw . and , one expects",
    ", mond would give a different answer than newtonian dynamics with dark matter . to actually deduce the present - day properties of the dwarfs would , however , require knowledge of the initial distribution of the orbital and intrinsic parameters of the dwarf - satellite population .",
    "nothing is really known about this , so we refrain from speculating on the subject .",
    "we only estimate where our dwarf satellites stand as regards external - field dominance , adiabaticity , and the importance of tidal effects .",
    "we consider the 10 dwarf spheroidal satellites with known parameters ( @xcite ) : sculptor , lsg 3 , fornax , carina , leo i , sextans , leo ii , ursa minor , draco , and sagittarius .",
    "we take for the mw @xmath180 kms@xmath181 . since only core radii , @xmath182 ,",
    "are given we write for the mean radius @xmath183 to get for the adiabaticity parameter of those dwarfs @xmath184 , respectively .",
    "so , with the exception of sagittarius  which is known to be in the throes of disruption  and perhaps sextans , these dwarfs are in the adiabatic regime within reasonable margins for @xmath185 , and even considering the approximate nature of the @xmath115 criterion . according to our analysis",
    "they are also only weakly affected by tidal forces at their present positions . as has been pointed out ( @xcite , @xcite ) , most of the above dwarfs ( with the exception of lsg 3 , leo i , and leo ii ) are materially affected by the efe : with the above choices of system parameters we get @xmath186 .",
    "if we apply the mond scaling @xmath66 , which is valid in the @xmath28 regime , to the dwarfs with @xmath187 ( except for sagittarius ) we can estimate the minimum galactocentric distance above which the bulk of the dwarf is immune to tidal effects .",
    "this is given by @xmath188 , where here a subscript 0 marks present - day values .",
    "( if a dwarf in now on an outgoing section of its orbit it will return to the same @xmath0 , as it goes in , in the same state . ) for sculptor , fornax , carina , sextans , umi , and draco we get , respectively @xmath189 kpc . the corresponding newtonian values ( @xmath190 )",
    "are @xmath191 kpc .",
    "they are smaller than the corresponding mond values if @xmath185 is not so large that @xmath192 .",
    "( for some dwarfs these newtonian radii may fall within the stellar mw where our approximation of a spherical , logarithmic potential is not valid . )",
    "our results imply that for a given dwarf in the adiabatic regime on an elongated orbit under a strong efe the size and velocity dispersion would be strongly dependent on the distance from the mother galaxy .",
    "one might then try to look for such correlations in the time - frozen population as seen today .",
    "this seems to us quite hopeless at present because the effects will be swamped by other factors of which we know very little ; in particular , the unknown distribution of initial ( intrinsic and orbital ) parameters for the dwarfs .",
    "this is aggravated by the small sample size .",
    "we leave for a future publication some other interesting effects predicted by mond that result from the efe .",
    "for example , in a dwarf in the efe regime the total angular momentum is not conserved .",
    "we alluded to the fact that the direction of the external field if felt by the `` internal '' dynamics of the dwarf . in a static or adiabatic situation",
    "only the angular momentum along the external - field direction is conserved ."

    "<S> the space of system parameters of the dwarf may be divided according to three main criteria : it can be either external- or internal - field dominated ; it can be in the adiabatic or in the impulsive regime ; and it can be in the tidal or non - tidal regime . </S>",
    "<S> the milky way s dwarf satellites populate all these regions of parameter space , and a single dwarf on an eccentric orbit can traverse several of them . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is particularly transparent in the external - field - dominated , adiabatic regime where the dynamics can be described analytically : due to the variation in the external - field strength with the galactocentric distance of the dwarf , @xmath0 , its size changes as @xmath1 , and the internal velocities change as @xmath0 . as the dwarf approaches the center it puffs up , becoming susceptible to tidal disruption . </S>",
    "<S> adiabaticity is lost roughly at the same @xmath0 were tidal effects become important . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior near and in the impulsive regime is studied numerically . </S>"
