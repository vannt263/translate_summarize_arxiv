    "each of those codings is associated to specific ways of characterizing a fraction , and even more important for us , to a specific basis for the responses .",
    "one of the possible definitions of a regular fraction refers to the property of non - existence of partial confounding of simple and interaction terms , and this property has to be associated to a specific basis , as explicitly pointed out in .    in our approach",
    ", we use polynomial algebra with complex coefficients , the @xmath0-roots of the unit coding , and the idea of indicator polynomial function , and we make no assumption about the number of levels . in the specific coding",
    "we use , the indicator polynomial is actually a linear combination of monomial terms which are centered and orthogonal on the full factorial design .",
    "we refer to such a basis to state the no - partial confounding property .    the definition of the regular fraction is hereafter generalized in the symmetric case with a prime number of levels .",
