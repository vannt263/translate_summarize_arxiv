    "1996 , madau et al .",
    "1996 , connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "these studies were facilitated by the availability of multi  wavelength datasets in those well  studied fields , which made possible the association of _ iso _ sources with galaxies for which redshifts had been determined through optical spectroscopy or for which they could be estimated on the basis of multi  band optical / near  infrared photometry .",
    "the same factors favour the study of the hdf ",
    "s region , and in this paper we discuss the association of our _ iso _ sources in the hdf ",
    "s with objects in optical and near  infrared catalogues of that field , and the estimation of their star formation rates .",
    "this process is significantly easier than was the case for our survey of the northern hdf ",
    "n , since , as emphasised in paper i , our _ iso _ dataset in the hdf  s is greatly superior , as a result of an observational strategy and data reduction procedure both revised significantly in the light of developing knowledge of the characteristics of the cam instrument and of the source population it probed .",
    "the plan of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : associations ] , we describe the existing optical and near  infrared catalogues in the hdf  s region with which we shall seek associations for our _ iso _ sources , review the likelihood ratio method used to obtain them and present the results of its application .",
    "section  [ sect : sfr_methods ] compares a variety of commonly used star formation rate ( sfr ) estimators , through applying them to model seds , while , in section  [ sect : sed_sfr ] , we apply the best of them to the multi ",
    "wavelength photometric datasets compiled for the galaxies with which we have associated our _ iso _ sources , to yield estimates of their sfrs , and section  [ sect : madau ] uses these results to assess the contribution of _",
    "iso_selected sources to the star formation history of the hdf  s . finally , in section  [ sect : discuss ] , we discuss the results of this paper and the conclusions we draw from them .",
    "appendices present mathematical details of the processes of correcting an sfr estimate to a canonical imf , and of computing the sampling variance in estimates of the sfr density using a lognormal model for the cosmological density field .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fields ] , the region within which the final source catalogue of paper i was selected is covered by a number of optical and near  infrared imaging surveys and we have sought to associate our _ iso _ _ sources _ with _ objects _ detected in all of them , using the likelihood ratio method detailed by sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) .",
    "the implementation of the likelihood ratio association technique used here is essentially identical to that we used for the _ iso_hdf ",
    "n sources in mann et al . ( 1997 ) , so we only briefly review it here .",
    "the likelihood ratio , @xmath11 , for the association of a particular source with a given catalogue object is defined to be the ratio , @xmath12 , of the infinitesimal probability of finding the true counterpart to the source at the position of the object and with its flux to the infinitesimal probability of an object with that flux being found there by chance .",
    "sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) show that it takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability distribution for positional offsets , @xmath15 , between source and object [ normalized so that @xmath16 with the integral being taken over all space ] , @xmath17 is the surface density of objects per unit interval in flux , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the probability distribution function for an ensemble of sources , measured in the same passband in which the object catalogue is defined .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 essentially measures the flux distribution of the true counterparts of the sources in the object catalogue , and is unknown unless associations have previously been found between an ensemble of similar sources and a catalogue of similar objects .",
    "sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) suggested that it may be estimated in binned form by subtracting from the flux histogram of the objects lying near the source positions that for the full object catalogue .",
    "if the latter is scaled to cover the same area as used to compute the former , then the resulting quantity is proportional to @xmath19 , exhibiting an excess of galaxies in the bins corresponding to the fluxes of the true counterparts of the sources in the object catalogues .",
    "mann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that , when applied to relatively small source samples , such as in our _ iso _ surveys of the two hubble deep fields , this empirical @xmath19 is very noisy , and they preferred to take @xmath19 to be a constant , independent of flux . since their figure 1 strongly implied that the _ iso  hdf ",
    "n _ sources were associated with objects brighter than @xmath20 in the catalogue of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this assumption would have led them to underestimate the value of @xmath21 for bright objects , but , in practice , this was seen to have no effect on the associations made , so we follow the same procedure here .",
    "the validity of making that same simplifying assumption here is illustrated by fig ,  [ fig : maghistfig ] , where we compare the r band magnitude distribution near ( defined to be within 6@xmath22 of ) the 30 _ iso _ sources from table 8 of paper i contained within the area of the gardner et al .",
    "catalogue , and that for the catalogue as a whole .",
    "this shows the strong excess of bright ( r=1921 ) objects near _ iso _ source positions  a two  sided kolmogorov  smirnov test gives a probability of @xmath23 that these two are drawn from the same parent distribution  which gives us confidence both in the reliability of our source detections and in our adopting a constant @xmath19 here .    for each association made between",
    "a given _ iso  hdf ",
    "n _ source and a particular object in the @xmath24band catalogue of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , mann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) computed the probability , @xmath25 , that a fictitious source , placed at random in the hdf ",
    "n , would have a likeliest association with an object in the @xmath24band catalogue producing a likelihood ratio at least as high as that for the source and object in question .",
    "clearly , @xmath26 combines information as to the reliability of the source detection as well as the probability that the given object is the correct counterpart of the source , but , as discussed below , it provides a useful measure of the quality of the associations made in this case : a more direct measure would be available ( sutherland & saunders 1992 , rutledge et al . 2000 ) if we could compute our @xmath11 values using a good estimate of @xmath19 , but , as mentioned above , the small number of sources here leads us to take @xmath19 to be a constant , thereby leaving @xmath11 defined only up to a multiplicative factor , in which case we can not employ the formalism of sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) or rutledge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for quantifying the reliability of associations .",
    "we sought associations for our _ iso _ sources with objects in the following set of catalogues : ( i ) the r band aat prime focus catalogue of verma et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; ( ii ) the @xmath24band stsci hst catalogue ; ( iii ) the i band eis catalogue of da costa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; ( iv ) the k band eis catalogue of da costa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; and ( v ) the r band ctio btc catalogue ( version 2 ) of gardner et al . ( 1999 ) , available from ` http://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov/~research/hdfs-btc/ ` .",
    "inspection of the results of this process revealed that almost all of the _ iso _ sources were associated with the same star or galaxy in each case , indicating the robustness of this method of association .",
    "moreover , the associations made using the different catalogues in their different bands yielded very similar @xmath26 values for the associations between given pairs of source and object , giving us confidence that it is a sound statistic to use .      as mentioned above , very similar @xmath26 results are obtained for our sources when the likelihood ratio procedure is run against all five optical and near - ir catalogues listed in the previous subsection .",
    "we take our principal association to be with the r band ctio btc catalogue of gardner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , simply because it includes the largest number of the objects associated with our sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : pran_hist ] we plot the histogram of @xmath26 values resulting from the association of the _ iso _ sources in table 8 of paper i with objects in the ctio catalogue .",
    "a few of our sources are clearly associated with objects in regions of the image masked out by gardner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) when they constructed their sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) catalogue from it : for these cases we use the @xmath26 value for associated eis k band or i band object instead .",
    "this histogram is similar to what we should expect : most of the _ iso _ sources have been associated with objects with low @xmath26 values , indicating a high probability that this is a correct identification , while there is a tail to high @xmath26 , due to sources that are either spurious or have optical counterparts too faint for detection in the ctio image , which has a limiting magnitude of @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath26 value to be taken as the threshold below which associations are defined to be good is somewhat arbitrary when the number of sources is low , as here : with a much larger number it is possible to see the point where the number of sources begins significantly to exceed the flat tail due to sources which are spurious or have no counterpart in the object catalogue , but that is clearly not possible in figure [ fig : pran_hist ] .",
    "the form of that histogram suggests that @xmath28 might be an appropriate threshold .",
    "note that mann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) took their threshold for reasonable identifications of _ iso  hdf ",
    "n _ sources to be 0.35 , so the much tighter bunching to lower @xmath26 values here indicates once more that the _ iso _ data presented here are of a far higher quality than those used in the initial _ iso  hdf ",
    "n _ analysis .",
    "in particular we have benefitted from the knowledge of the _ iso_cam image distortion which was uncharacterized at the time that mann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) performed their identification of the optical counterparts of the _ iso  hdf ",
    "n _ sources .    in figure",
    "[ fig : id_post ] we show postage stamp images for the 32 sources in paper i with reliable associations , overlaying _",
    "iso _ 6.7 and 15 @xmath0 m contours onto optical images , with the associated object lying at @xmath29 .",
    "table [ tab : id_props ] summarizes the properties of these objects , while the next subsection presents more details of the associations . as mentioned previously , principal associations were made with the gsfc r band catalogue of gardner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , so the optical magnitudes tabulated are from their catalogue , with one exception ( isohdfs  j223237 - 603235 ) , which is omitted from their catalogue , causing us to use the eis optical catalogue of da costa et al .",
    "the photometric data in the gsfc catalogue are calibrated using standards measured in johnson ubv and cousins ri , so we quote all optical magnitudes in that system .",
    "for the one case of isohdfs  j223237 - 603235 , this involves converting the ubvri magnitudes back to the johnson - cousins system from the ab system in which da costa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) present their photometry , using the conversions given in their paper , namely @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for their near - infrared data ,",
    "da costa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) performed photometric calibration in jhk using persson et al .",

    "[ tab : id_props ] we present spectroscopic redshifts from glazebrook et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where available , and photometric redshifts where not .",
    "photometric redshifts were estimated by three of us , using independent methods : m. rowan  robinson ( mrr ) used ( rowan  robinson 2001 ) seds based on those of yoshii & takahara ( 1988 ) , a. franceschini ( af ) used the pegase models of fioc & rocca  volmerange ( 1997 ) and r.g .",

    "results for individual galaxies are discussed below , but , in most cases , these independent methods yielded photometric redshift estimates that agreed with each other , and with those computed by stephen gwyn ( gwyn 1999 ) and the suny group , to @xmath38 , which is therefore the accuracy we claim for the adopted photometric redshifts listed in parentheses in table [ tab : id_props ] .

    "this is because the source is missing from the gsfc catalogue , while the remaining have significantly lower @xmath26 values resulting from their likelihood ratio association with the eis k band catalogue than with the gsfc r band catalogue , as a result of red @xmath39 colours : these three objects are the first , second and ninth reddest of the 24 associated objects for which @xmath39 has been measured .      1 .   *",

    "eight of the 32 identified sources are stars , leaving a total of 24 galaxies to be considered further .",

    "a multitude of methods have been advocated for the estimation of the star formation rates of galaxies , and , as discussed , for example , by cram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and granato et al . ( 2000 ) , they agree to varying degrees .",
    "all attempt to detect the observational consequences of the formation of massive stars , and then use a model for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) to infer the total rate of formation of stellar mass .",
    "this inevitably introduces some uncertainty into the sfr estimates , due to the assumption of a universal imf for all galaxies and the lack of a clear choice between competing models for it .",
    "more serious is the fact that the formation of massive stars in external galaxies , like that in our own galaxy , is expected to take place in giant molecular clouds , enshrouded by dust , and , as argued , for example , by silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and jimenez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the resultant emission from the star  forming region can not be well represented by a simple model such as a dust  screen in front of a dust  free starburst .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "there are several well  used prescriptions for estimating the sfrs of galaxies on the basis of simple broad  band fluxes , as these are , typically , all that are available for the large samples of galaxies used in censuses of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "the first of these is to use the u band magnitude , arguing that the uv emission comes principally from massive , young stars .",
    "there are two problems with this .",
    "firstly , the u band ( @xmath94 nm ) is not far enough into the ultraviolet for the emission from older stars to be negligible , but it is possible to correct for this effect , by using model spectra to bootstrap from the u band to , say , 250 nm , where the emission is dominated by massive stars .",
    "cram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) do this , obtaining the following relationship between the u band luminosity of a galaxy and its rate of massive ( @xmath95 ) star formation : @xmath96 for an assumed @xmath97 imf running from 0.1 to 100 @xmath98 .",
    "an obvious objection to this is that it fails to account for the effects of dust in the star  forming galaxies , especially in the case that more massive starbursts are dustier .",
    "the recent models of devriendt , guiderdoni & sadat ( 1999 ) seek to model the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of dusty starbursts from the uv to the submillimetre in a self  consistent fashion , taking account of the absorption of ultraviolet light from massive young stars by the dust surrounding them , and its use in heating up the dust , leading to emission in the far  infrared and submillimetre .",
    "their models yield the following correlations between the star formation rate ( for a salpeter 1955 imf over [ 0.1,120 ] @xmath98 ) and the luminosities at two uv wavelengths : @xmath99^{1.62 } \\label{eq : sfr2}\\ ] ] and @xmath100^{1.72 } , \\label{eq : sfr3}\\ ] ] devriendt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) caution against the over  interpretation of these best  fit correlations ( about which their model galaxies scatter quite widely ) , but the non  linearity of the relationships they describe between sfr and uv luminosity is qualitatively what would be expected in a model in which the more massive a starburst is the dustier it is , and suggests that this effect may be corrected for , albeit crudely .    the bolometric luminosities of luminous starburst galaxies are dominated by thermal emission from dust in the far  infrared . in general , this emission is a combination of extended ( _ `` cirrus '' _ ) emission from dust heated by the ambient interstellar radiation field , more localized _",
    "`` starburst '' _ emission from the dust in regions of massive star formation heated by the uv flux from o and b stars , and , possibly , _",
    "`` agn '' _ emission from the hot dusty torus of an active galactic nucleus .",
    "the relative importance of these components varies between galaxies ( e.g. rowan  robinson & crawford 1989 ) , with the cirrus component declining to higher luminosities , where ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are seen to be mostly fueled by starburst emission , although some do have a dominant agn component ( genzel et al .",

    "robinson et al .",

    "as reviewed by condon ( 1992 ) there is a well  known correlation between the far  infrared and decimetric radio luminosities of actively star  forming galaxies , which is thought to arise from the fact that the bulk of the radio luminosity is produced by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons spiraling in the remnants of supernovae originating in the same population of massive stars that produce the starburst component to the far  infrared luminosity . since the cirrus component to the far ",
    "infrared luminosity is not expected to have associated radio emission , it has been argued that the decimetric radio luminosity of a starburst galaxy may provide the cleanest handle on its star formation rate , and cram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) present the following form for that relationship ( assuming the same imf as before ) : @xmath109 where , as before , cram et al . consider only the formation of stars with @xmath110 in an @xmath111 imf .",
    "additional sfr estimators exist , for example using the luminosity in the h@xmath112 line ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ) , but these , too , are affected by dust , as shown by rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the basis of near  infrared vlt  isaac spectroscopy of the h@xmath112 line in a subsample of the iso  hdf  s objects considered here .",
    "it is natural to enquire how these sfr estimators compare , and this question was addressed empirically by cram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using a somewhat heterogeneous compilation of data ( u band magnitudes , h@xmath112 , 60@xmath0 m and 1.4 ghz radio fluxes ) from a variety of sources .",
    "they found that the star formation rates deduced from the integrated far  infrared and decimetric radio luminosities are well correlated over more than four orders of magnitude , but that the significant deviations from linearity and greater scatter are seen for the relationships between the sfrs deduced from the 1.4 ghz power and those from h@xmath112 and u band luminosities .",
    "some observational effects ( e.g. slit losses in h@xmath112 spectroscopy ) may be contributing to these trends , but they are consistent with the qualitative expectations of the picture outlined above in which massive stars are formed in dusty environments , and reinforce the belief that this is the dominant mode of star formation in actively star  forming galaxies .    here",
    "we perform a complementary study , which attempts to circumvent the observational problems that inevitably affect the analysis of any heterogeneous data sample drawn from many sources in the literature , by asking how these different star formation estimators fare when applied to model seds for a range of types of star  forming galaxy .",
    "to do this we use the _ grasil _ models of silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which provide good fits to the uv  radio seds of six nearby galaxies , namely three starburst galaxies ( arp220 , m82 and ngc6090 ) with differing levels of activity , and three local spirals ( m100 , m51 and ngc6946 ) : similar models of starbursts are presented by efstathious , rowan  robinson & siebenmorgen ( 2000 ) , but they do not consider normal spirals , which is why we use the _ grasil _ models here .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper by silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a discussion of the uv  mm seds , and to silva ( 1999 ) for details of their extension into the radio , through consideration of separate thermal and non  thermal components to the radio emission , and note that granato et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also compared star formation estimators through their application to _ grasil _ seds .",

    "hence , to compare the sfr estimators , by seeing how well each recovers those values , we must scale eqns.(2 ) - ( 8) as required for them all to give the rate at which stellar mass would form given that reference imf ; this is analogous to the choice of the value of @xmath114 in the formalism of rowan  robinson et al .",

    "these volumes are small enough that the variation in mean density between surveys carried out in different regions of the universe are expected to be significant . using the power spectrum of peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) and the conversion from length scale to effective wavenumber for cubic cells ( peacock 1991 ) we estimate that the fractional density fluctuations in cubic cells of this volume at redshift zero will be @xmath155 , while that of spheres would have @xmath156 . note that the variances in local cells with the same geometry as our survey volumes are likely to be larger than this , as their elongated shape would lead to a window function that lets in more small  scale power than spherical or cubic window functions do . several more effects further complicate an assessment of the sampling variance in our sfr density estimates .",
    "firstly , there is evolution in the density field with redshift across the two sampling volumes . at @xmath157 and @xmath51 ,",
    "in the middle of our two redshift bins , the linear theory variances in a given volume would be factors of @xmath158 , i.e. 1.4 and 2.3 , respectively , below their values at redshift zero , while non  linear effects as @xmath159 are likely to make the decrease more pronounced than these linear theory estimates suggest .",
    "furthermore , the shape of our survey volumes means that they have more volume at higher redshift , where the density field is less evolved .",
    "a further complicating factor is the bias between the galaxy and mass distributions , which is likely to lead to a higher sampling variance for the total sfrs in our two redshift bins than that for the mass they contain , and an additional uncertainty in the redshift variation across the bins : kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that the evolution of galaxy clustering strength over is a function of cosmology , at least in their galaxy formation models .",
    "clearly , the quantitative assessment of these various factors is beyond the scope of the current paper , so we shall base this study of the effects of sampling variance on @xmath8 estimates on the assumption that the variance in the mass contained in our two redshift bins is @xmath160 and that @xmath161 and @xmath162 are likely to be conservative bounds to the true values .",
    "the variance , @xmath163 is equal to @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the variance in the mass density field , and @xmath166 is its mean value",

    "this method neglects the fact that , since @xmath160 , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the cosmological density field will have been significantly skewed by gravitational evolution .",
    "this skewness will be reflected in strongly asymmetric error bars on our @xmath8 estimates due to sampling variance : with such a skewed pdf , our randomly  selected survey volume ( the selection of the hdf ",
    "s region was based on the presence of a @xmath171 quasar , which should have no bearing on the properties of galaxies at @xmath172 ) is much more likely to be underdense than overdense , and , hence , we are much more likely to have measured a value of @xmath8 that is lower than the global mean than one higher that it . estimating the level of such an effect is very difficult .",
    "a full analysis would require a large numerical simulation of the cosmological density field , coupled to a galaxy formation model capable of predicting accurately the sites of formation of the class of galaxies detected in our _ iso _ survey , which is far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "simple analytic models prescriptions do exist for following the gravitational evolution of the pdf , but most are based on approximations ( _ e.g. _ perturbation theory or the zeldovich approximation ) that break down by @xmath173 . bernardeau & kofman ( 1995 ) have , however , shown that a lognormal model continues to give a good fit to the pdf derived from _",
    "n_body simulations of a cold dark matter universe until at least @xmath174 , so this is one analytic form that might be used .    in appendix",
    "b we show how this approximation may be used , within a bayesian framework , to compute the 68 per cent confidence intervals for @xmath175 , the _ global _ star formation rate density at the redshifts corresponding to the centres of our two bins , given our raw @xmath8 values and our estimate that the matter variance in cells of size equal to our survey volumes is .",
    "this analysis reveals that , for a best guess of @xmath176 , , while increasing or decreasing @xmath163 by a factor of 2 barely changes the lower limit to @xmath177 , while the upper limit increases to 5.0 or decreases to 2.3 , respectively .",
    "thus we see that sampling variance introduces a larger uncertainty into the estimation of @xmath8 than that caused by the uncertainties in the sfrs of the individual galaxies in our survey . assuming @xmath176 , we estimate and @xmath178 for the @xmath179 and @xmath147 bins , respectively , where we define confidence intervals solely using our sampling variance analysis .    we plot these confidence intervals on fig .

    "( 2000 ) shows further that this dust obscuration is not well corrected for using optically  determined extinction values .",
    "all these methods look for indications of the formation of massive stars , so a further complication in the determination of the absolute rate at which stellar mass is being formed in a given galaxy is uncertainty in the imf , since the vast majority of the mass resides in stars not directly probed by these methods , so sfr estimates differing by factors of a few can result if differing imfs are assumed .",
    "caution must be exercised when applying these estimators in situations where the sed type of the galaxies under study are constrained only by a small number of broad  band fluxes , suggesting that constraints on the cosmic star formation history are best obtained in well  studied fields , such as the hubble deep fields , where rich , multiwavength datasets are available .",

    "thermal emission from the remnants of type ib and type ii supernovae . in this picture , the radio luminosity is , thus , proportional to the ( type ib and type ii ) supernova rate , @xmath224 , which is equated to the rate of formation of progenitors of sufficient mass ( @xmath225 ) : @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the fraction of stars formed which have mass @xmath225 , and @xmath228 equals the number of stars formed per unit time .",

    "[ eqn : lognormal ] .",
    "the relatively small fraction of area under the curves at @xmath260 , indicates the low probability that the true global mean sfr density will be lower than that estimated , reflecting the fact that for @xmath261 much more of the universe is underdense than overdense .",
    "however , the mean value of @xmath262 must always equal unity , by definition , so our estimated sfr density is not a biased estimate , but the evolution of the cosmological density field through gravitational instability does act to increase the width of the confidence range for @xmath263 at a given percentile .    for the lognormal model , this is simple is to compute . to obtain the width of , say , the 68 per cent confidence region for @xmath264",
