    "an important problem in ads / cft @xcite is to understand the hilbert spaces of both sides .",
    "the string or m - theory is put on global ads , and the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) is radially quantized .",
    "partition function encodes the information on hilbert space . in particular",
    ", one has to understand the spectrum of strongly interacting cft , which is in general difficult , to use the dual string / m - theory to study various phenomena in conventional gravity .    with supersymmetry , one can try to circumvent this difficulty by considering quantities which contain possibly less information than the partition function but do not depend on ( or depend much more mildly on ) the coupling constants controlling the interaction .",
    "this has been considered in the context of ads / cft . if a superconformal theory has _ continuous _",
    "parameters , one can construct a function called the superconformal index which does not depend on changes of them @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the superconformal index was investigated in 4 dimension @xcite , and then in 3 , 5 , 6 dimensions @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "in all these cases , the superconformal index is essentially the witten index @xcite and acquires nonzero contribution only from states preserving supersymmetry .",
    "the superconformal index was computed for a class of scft@xmath6 in @xcite , including the @xmath7 yang - mills theory .",
    "similar quantity called the elliptic genus was also studied in 2 dimensional scft @xcite .",
    "the latter index played a major role in understanding supersymmetric black holes in ads@xmath8/cft@xmath9 @xcite .    in this paper , we study the superconformal index in ads@xmath6/cft@xmath8 .    recently , based on the idea of using superconformal chern - simons theory @xcite to describe low energy dynamics of m2-branes , and after the first discovery of a class of @xmath10 superconformal chern - simons theories @xcite , @xmath0 superconformal chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath11 has been found and studied , where the integers @xmath2 and @xmath12 denote the chern - simons levels associated with two gauge groups @xcite .",
    "this theory describes the low energy dynamics of @xmath4 parallel m2-branes placed at the tip of @xmath13 , and is proposed to be dual to m - theory on @xmath3 .",
    "see @xcite for further studies of this theory .",
    "various tests have been made for this proposal .",
    "for instance , studies of the moduli space @xcite and @xmath14 branes @xcite , chiral operators @xcite , higher derivative correction in the broken phase @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , integrability and nonsupersymmetric spectrum @xcite have been made .",
    "many of these tests , perhaps except the last example above , rely on supersymmetry in some form .",
    "one of the most refined application of supersymmetry to test this duality so far would be the calculation of the superconformal index in the type iia limit @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the superconformal index was calculated in the t hooft limit , in which @xmath4 and @xmath2 are taken to be large keeping @xmath15 finite .",
    "the authors of @xcite argue that @xmath16 can be regarded as a continuous parameter in the t hooft limit .",
    "the index calculated in the free chern - simons theory , @xmath17 , is expected to be the same as the index in the opposite limit @xmath18 from the continuity argument .",
    "m - theory can be approximated by type iia supergravity on @xmath19 in the latter limit , where @xmath20 appears as the base space in the hopf fibration of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the index over multiple type iia gravitons perfectly agreed with the gauge theory result @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to go beyond the t hooft limit and calculate the full superconformal index for any value of @xmath2 ( and @xmath4 ) for this theory .",
    "this is the main goal of this paper .",
    "the general index is expected to capture the contribution from states carrying kaluza - klein ( kk ) momenta along the fiber circle of @xmath21 , or @xmath22 brane charges from type iia point of view . as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the radius of the circle decreases as @xmath23 , and the energy of the kk states would grow .",
    "so even when @xmath2 is very large that weakly coupled type iia string theory is reliable , our index captures nonperturbative correction to @xcite from heavy @xmath22 branes .",
    "the gauge theory dual to the kk - momentum is argued to be appropriate magnetic flux on @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory operators creating magnetic fluxes are called the monopole operators , or t hooft operators @xcite .",
    "these operators are not completely understood to date .    just like the ordinary partition function at finite temperature ,",
    "the superconformal index for a radially quantized scft admits a path integral representation . in this paper",
    "we calculate the index from this path integral for the @xmath0 chern - simons theory on euclidean @xmath25 .",
    "the index in the sector with nonzero kk - momentum is given by integrating over configurations carrying nonzero magnetic fluxes , which will turn out to be fairly straightforward .",
    "therefore , lack of our understanding on t hooft operators will not cause a problem for us .",
    "in fact , monopole operators have been most conveniently studied in radially quantized theories @xcite .",
    "our computation is based on the fact that this path integral is ` supersymmetric , ' or has a fermionic symmetry . as a witten index ,",
    "the superconformal index acquires contribution from states preserving a particular pair of supercharges which are mutually hermitian conjugates . calling one of them @xmath26 , which is nilpotent , @xmath27 , the fermionic symmetry of the integral",
    "is associated with @xmath26 .",
    "an integral of this kind can be computed by localization .",
    "see @xcite and related references therein for a comprehensive discussion .",
    "a simple way of stating the idea is that one can deform the integrand by adding a @xmath26-exact term @xmath28 in the measure , for any gauge invariant expression @xmath29 , without changing the integral . for a given @xmath29",
    ", one can add @xmath30 to the action @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a continuous parameter . with a favorable choice of @xmath29",
    "as will be explained later , @xmath32 can be regarded as a continuous coupling constant of the deformed action admitting a ` free ' theory limit as @xmath33 .",
    "as already mentioned in @xcite , it suffices for the deformed action to preserve only a subset of the full superconformal symmetry , involving @xmath26 and symmetries associated with charges with which we grade the states in the index .",
    "we only take advantage of a nilpotent symmetry rather than full superconformal symmetry .    as in @xcite ,",
    "our result is given by an integral of appropriate unitary matrices .",
    "we use our superconformal index to provide a nontrivial test of the @xmath0 ads / cft proposal .",
    "the readers may also regard it as subjecting our calculation to a test against known results from gravity , if they prefer to . in the large @xmath4 limit , still keeping @xmath2 finite , our index is expected to be the index over supersymmetric gravitons of m - theory at low energy . in the sectors with one , two and three units of magnetic fluxes ( kk - momenta ) , we provide analytic calculations or evaluate the unitary matrix integral numerically , up to a fairly nontrivial order , to see that the two indices perfectly agree .",
    "similar comparisons with gravitons in dual string theories are made in other dimensions , e.g. for the 2 dimensional elliptic genus index @xcite and also for the 4 dimensional index in @xmath7 yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "we will find that monopole operators in nontrivial representations of @xmath34 , beyond those studied in @xcite , play crucial roles for the two indices to agree .",
    "an interesting question would be whether our index captures contribution from supersymmetric black holes beyond the low energy limit .",
    "in ads@xmath8/cft@xmath9 , the contribution to the elliptic genus index from btz black holes is calculated and further discussed @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent study of elliptic genus beyond gravitons .",
    "however , in 4 dimension , it has been found that the index does not capture the contribution from supersymmetric black holes @xcite in the large @xmath4 limit , possibly due to a cancelation between bosonic and fermionic states . in this",
    "paper , following @xcite , we consider the large @xmath4 limit in which chemical potentials are set to order 1 ( in the unit given by the radius of @xmath24 ) .",
    "the situation here is somewhat similar to @xmath35 in that a deconfinement phase transition at order @xmath36 temperature like @xcite is not found .",
    "however , more comment is given in the conclusion .",
    "the methods developed in this paper can be applied to other superconformal chern - simons theories .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath7 chern - simons - matter theories and the gravity duals of some of them are studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
