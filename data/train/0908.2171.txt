    "in the standard model ( sm ) , top quarks are expected to be produced singly in @xmath10 collisions through @xmath0-channel or @xmath1-channel exchange of a virtual @xmath11 boson  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for studying single top quarks are compelling : the production cross section is directly proportional to the square of the ckm matrix  @xcite element @xmath12 , and the cross section measurement is sensitive to fourth - generation models , models with flavor - changing neutral currents , and other new phenomena  @xcite . the main backgrounds to the single top final state are @xmath11+jets production ,   production , and qcd multijet production .",
    "electroweak production of single top quarks is a difficult process to measure because the expected production cross section ( @xmath13  pb  @xcite ) is much smaller than those of the background processes , and it is also smaller than the uncertainty on the total background .",
    "the presence of only one top quark in the event provides fewer features to use in separating the signal from background , compared with measurements of top pair production ( ) , which was first observed in 1995  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have developed a variety of sophisticated multivariate techniques that take advantage of the differences in the kinematic distributions between signal and backgrounds .",
    "these have successfully been used to observe the process , at the 5.0 standard deviation level of significance , separately by d0  @xcite and by cdf  @xcite .",
    "further details of these analyses are given in earlier publications presenting evidence for single top production in smaller samples of data  @xcite .    because the presence of single top production has been firmly established by the two collaborations and due to the computational difficulty of computing the significance of the two in combination",
    ", we do not perform a hypothesis test of the combined results .",
    "the cross section measurements , however , remain limited in precision by the sizes of the data samples collected by the two collaborations , and thus a combination of the results provides a more precise measurement and also stronger constraints on the ckm matrix element @xmath12 .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations both measure the single top cross section and extract @xmath12 using a bayesian statistical analysis .",
    "we use the same method here to combine the two measurements .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations use independently developed computer programs for performing the calculation , and we have verified that both codes reproduce the individual experiment results . since the two codes produce consistent results we use the d0 code here to obtain the combined tevatron results .",
    "cdf and d0 have exchanged histograms of their final multivariate discriminants for the observed data and all signals and backgrounds in each analysis channel .",
    "furthermore , all systematic uncertainties  those on the predicted rates , histogram shapes , and bin - by - bin independent monte carlo statistical uncertainties , have been exchanged as well .",
    "rate and shape uncertainties are categorized by their source for use in evaluating correlations , between signals and/or backgrounds within a channel , between channels , and between experiments .",
    "sources of systematic uncertainty that are common to the measurements of the two collaborations have been assigned 100% correlation , and other sources of uncertainty are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "a list of systematic uncertainties is given in table  [ tab : tevsyst ] and discussed in more detail below .",
    "the method used for extraction of the cross section chosen by the collaborations is a bayesian technique  @xcite .",
    "the posterior probability density is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the joint likelihood function of all bins in all histograms @xmath16 @xmath17 is the set of nuisance parameters ( such as integrated luminosity , @xmath18-tag efficiency , and other rate and shape parameters ) , and @xmath19 is the product of the priors encoding the systematic uncertainties on @xmath20 .",
    "the predictions for the number of signal events ( @xmath21 ) and background events ( @xmath22 ) depend on the values of the nuisance parameters .    the prior density for the signal cross section is taken to be a nonnegative flat prior , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and @xmath25 otherwise . here , @xmath26 is the highest signal cross section axis point ( 7  pb for the combination ) .",
    "the priors on @xmath17 are truncated gaussians , where the truncations are introduced so as not to allow negative predictions of @xmath21 or @xmath22 for any template in any bin .",
    "the integral over @xmath27 is performed through numerical integration .",
    "we quote the measured cross section as the value that maximizes the posterior likelihood , and the uncertainty as the shortest interval containing 68% of the posterior area .",
    "in addition to the above , the d0 code uses a gamma prior for the mc statistics uncertainty , reflecting the poisson nature of mc statistics , and having the additional advantage that an analytic solution to the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : posterior ] exists .",
    "this does not bias the cross section but reduces the computing time considerably .",
    "the combination procedure includes all channels from both collaborations in the bayesian analysis , including correlations of systematic uncertainties between experiments .",
    "we combine the cdf super - discriminant , the cdf missing transverse energy ( ) plus jets analysis , and the d0 combination discriminant . while there are some differences in the detailed treatments of uncertainties , the cdf and d0 codes give results consistent with each other when run over the individual inputs .",
    "we have verified this by running the d0 code over the cdf inputs .",
