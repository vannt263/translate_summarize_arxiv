    "since qcd is presently intractable at low energies , approximation schemes based on effective models have been introduced @xcite .",
    "these models in a way incorporate some important features of qcd , like chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breakdown .    though being approximative , these effective models still can not be treated exactly .",
    "therefore we have essentially two levels of approximation : i ) when we choose the model itself and ii ) when we specify an approximation scheme in order to perform actual calculations within the model .",
    "this implies that the results may depend on the actual approximation scheme .",
    "therefore , a failure of the model could be due to the model itself , due to the approximation scheme or both .",
    "so , if we want to test the model , we should be careful about the approximation scheme and keep the dependence on ad hoc parameters as small as possible .",
    "one of the effective models of qcd to describe the nucleon is the chiral @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure to calculate nucleonic properties in the soliton picture is to use the loop expansion up to the one quark loop level , i.e ; to integrate out the quark degrees of freedom and use the remaining purely mesonic effective action at the zero loop level in the mesonic fields @xcite .",
    "one can choose some cut - off procedure to regularize the quark determinant @xcite , but in any case one has to renormalize by introducing appropriate counter terms in order to define the parameters appearing in the original lagrangian of the model @xcite .",
    "eventually one can let the cut - off go to infinity as it is usually done in renormalization theory , or leave it finite .",
    "we note that in the @xmath0-model , however , neither the cut - off scheme itself nor the size of the cut - off can be determined uniquely .",
    "it is known , however , that the loop expansion for asymptotically non free theories without ad hoc cut - off parameters displays an unphysical pole in the corresponding propagators , the so called landau ghost @xcite .",
    "therefore , if one follows the procedure outlined above , one finds that the renormalized @xmath0-model is plagued by the landau ghost , which leads to an instability of the usual translational invariant vacuum @xcite . in view of our remarks at the beginning of this section",
    ", the problem of this landau ghost can be treated in several ways :    1 .",
    "the effective model is considered as unphysical and is abandoned .",
    "2 .   the approximation scheme ( loop expansion )",
    "is considered appropriate , but the effective model can be used only with a regularization scheme , hereby being restricted to energies far below the unphysical pole .",
    "the approximation scheme is improved such that the effective model does not a priori yield unphysical results for energies up to the order of the baryon mass .",
    "the second viewpoint implies that vacuum loops are either simply discarded , or calculated with finite cut - off .",
    "concerning the first alternative ( drop vacuum loops ) , we note that in some situations , like in an external field , such a treatment violates conservation laws @xcite and can not be implemented consistently . besides this",
    ", the investigation of the change of the vacuum structure due to the finite density should be an important subject for any relativistic field theory .",
    "concerning the second alternative ( finite cut - off ) , we note that the landau ghost in hardonic theories occurs at rather low energies of the order of the baryon mass ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this means that its presence is a real problem for effective quark theories , and its avoidance by the introduction of an ad hoc parameter is somewhat unsatisfactory . since the energy scale relevant for effective quark theories is set by hadronic masses , a treatment according to the third viewpoint , which we will adopt in this paper , is a feasible alternative .",
    "we consider the landau ghost as one of the basic infinities in effective field theories which should be brought under control without the introduction of further parameters . in a different context",
    ", this viewpoint has been taken already a long time ago by redmond and bogoliubov et al @xcite who have shown how to construct ghost free propagators in the framework of the loop expansion based on the requirement of the klln - lehmann representation .",
    "their propagators have several interesting features : the associated wave function renormalization constant is finite , and they have an essential singularity at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the coupling constant ) which is expected from more intuitive physical arguments @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the associated running coupling constant has no singularity at space - like momentum transfers , the zero charge problem is avoided .",
    "their method has recently been formulated in the language of the effective action @xcite , which is suitable for effective quark theories , and also applied to infinite systems @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to show a practical way to incorporate the ghost elimination in a finite system like the soliton , and to demonstrate that with this procedure the translational invariant vacuum becomes stable with respect to decay into an array of small sized configurations .",
    "we will _ not _ construct the fully self consistent solutions including valence quarks in this paper which is left for a future work .",
    "( for another possibility to avoid the landau ghost by introducing vector bosons , see ref . @xcite . )",
    "the @xmath0-model has so far not yet been fully exploited to obtain self consistent solutions including the effect of the dirac sea .",
    "one of our motivations for investigating this model is as follows : in contrast to the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , which has been extensively used to construct solitonic solutions @xcite , it has a @xmath4 interaction term with variable strength ( specified by the @xmath0 mass ) which controls the deviation of the chiral radius from its vacuum value .",
    "such a term would contribute to the ground state energy the more the farther the chiral fields are away from the chiral circle of the vacuum .",
    "since it is known that interactions terms of the form @xmath4 @xcite or of higher order like the thooft determinant interaction @xcite can prevent the collapse of the njl soliton , there is the possibility that stable solitons exist for the linear @xmath0-model . the major obstacle to a full investigation of the solitonic sector of the @xmath0-model , however , was the instability of the translational invariant vacuum .",
    "the fact , to be established in this paper , that the method of redmond and bogoliubov et al leads to a stabilization of the translational invariant vacuum is a first step towards self consistent solutions in the @xmath0-model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : to be self contained and to set the formalism we state in sect .",
    "2 some results for the ground state energy in the @xmath0-model obtained earlier @xcite , and explain the role of the landau ghost in a way which seems most transparent to us and which is appropriate for implementing the ghost elimination procedure . in sect .",
    "3 we construct a ghost free model and show results for the ground state energy , and in sect .",
    "4 we summarize our results .",
    "we now proceed to exhibit how the landau ghost contributes to the vacuum instability .",
    "the euclidean lagrangian of the @xmath0-model reads , after introducing the physical parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 instead of the original ones @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "\\label{eq : lmes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 stands for the u and d quarks , @xmath12 is the effective quark mass , @xmath13 is the chiral field , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 the pion decay constant .",
    "the model contains the two free parameters @xmath3 ( or @xmath16 ) and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath0 , and in the symmetric limit ( @xmath18 ) we have @xmath19@xcite .",
    "our euclidean metric is such that @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 with @xmath23 the upper limit of euclidean time integration , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 the usual dirac @xmath23-matrix . defining the effective bosonic action @xmath26 from the generating functional @xmath27 as usual @xcite by @xmath28 we obtain after integrating out the quark fields @xmath29 with @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of colors and @xmath33 refers to the dirac and isospin indices , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 the integrals over the euclidean time @xmath36 extend from 0 to @xmath23 .",
    "the counter terms ( c.t . ) in ( [ eq : gferm ] ) , which include the subtraction of the translational invariant vacuum contribution ( @xmath37 ) , are determined such that @xmath38 gives no terms of the same form as those already present in @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to the mesonic mass and wave function renormalization at the renormalization point @xmath40 @xcite . from here on we consider the chiral symmetric case ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the vacuum instability can be seen by expanding the ground state energy @xmath41 in powers of a characteristic length scale @xmath42 where the classical meson fields are localized .",
    "we assume time independent fields @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "if we use @xmath45 as the integration variable , every derivative gives rise to a factor @xmath46 , and therefore terms involving derivatives will be dominant for small r compared to those without derivatives .",
    "therefore , up to @xmath47 @xmath39 contributes only the kinetic term . to obtain the lowest order contribution from @xmath38 we expand the logarithm in ( [ eq : gferm ] ) and",
    "note that the term linear in @xmath48 is cancelled by a counter term .",
    "then for small r the leading term is the one quadratic in the derivatives , i.e ; quadratic in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) . from the above",
    "we see that the linear and the non linear model look the same at small sizes .",
    "the complete term of order @xmath49 is @xmath50    let us consider eq.([eq : v2 ] ) in a continuous and infinite plane wave ( pw ) basis @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the volume .",
    "then the matrix element @xmath53 equals @xmath54 , i.e ; the fourier transform of @xmath55 with @xmath56 . using the dimensionless variables @xmath44 and @xmath57 and keeping for @xmath48 only the first term in eq.([eq : v ] )",
    "we obtain for ( [ eq : v2 ] ) in the continuum limit @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the fourier transform of @xmath61 : @xmath62 adding the kinetic term , we get the leading contribution to the effective action in the small size expansion as ^(s.s ) = |l(*t*)|^2 ( 1 + 4g^2n_c(()^2 ) ) + o(r^2 ) . [ eq : v2n.1 ] since @xmath63 as @xmath64 it follows that ( [ eq : v2n ] ) behaves as + @xmath65 for @xmath66 with @xmath67 , which overcomes the kinetic term ( the @xmath68 in ( ( [ eq : v2n.1 ] ) ) ) for @xmath42 small enough , leading to a negative value for @xmath69 .",
    "this means that for small sizes r the energy of this non - translational invariant vacuum can become lower than the energy of the translational invariant vacuum .    to see that the landau ghost in the meson propagators is responsible for this vacuum instability , we use the fact that the effective action , when expanded around the fields in the translational invariant vacuum ( @xmath70 ) , gives the inverse @xmath0 and @xmath71 propagators in the translational invariant vacuum as the coefficients of the terms of second order in @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "if we express @xmath48 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) in terms of @xmath74 using @xmath13 , we see that these second order terms are completely contained in ( [ eq : v2 ] ) .",
    "taking also the terms of second order in @xmath75 in the mesonic term in ( [ eq : gmes ] ) , we obtain @xcite @xmath76 with the inverse euclidean schwinger - dyson propagators @xmath77 in fig . [",
    "fig : prop ] we show the inverse pion propagator ( [ eq : proppi ] ) for @xmath78 by the dashed line .",
    "the previously noted behaviour of @xmath79 leads to the landau ghost pole at euclidean @xmath80 , and as a consequence ( [ eq : g2 ] ) can become more and more negative for large @xmath81 , i.e ; for small sized fields . in this limit of small sized fields",
    "the leading contribution to ( [ eq : g2 ] ) comes from the terms @xmath82 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : proppi ] ) and ( [ eq : propsi ] ) , and if expressed in terms of @xmath57 this gives again eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2n ] ) . [ note that @xmath83 with @xmath84 the fourier transform of @xmath85 and similar for @xmath86 . ]",
    "we now address the problem of removing the landau ghost in a finite system .",
    "the procedure is described in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been extended to the path integral formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the ground state energy we have to first obtain meson propagators with the correct analytical properties .",
    "these propagators are then implanted into the effective action which is in turn used to calculate the ground state energy .",
    "the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite to eliminate the landau ghost from the effective action is to replace the schwinger - dyson propagators @xmath87 in the second order term ( [ eq : g2 ] ) by the klln - lehmann ( kl ) propagators @xmath88 .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , these are constructed from the kl representation using a spectral function obtained from the one - loop meson self energy , and are free of the landau ghost .",
    "thus , in this method the loop approximation is is used only for the _ imaginary _ part , while the real part is calculated from the dispersion relation .",
    "since this method avoids the landau ghost , it clearly represents an improvement of the straight forward loop approximation for the whole propagator .",
    "the new effective action becomes @xmath89 in order to be consistent with chiral symmetry , however , this ghost subtraction has to be done under the constraint of the ward identity @xcite @xmath90 with @xmath91 the @xmath92 vertex where one of the external pions has zero momentum . to preserve this identity the difference of the @xmath0 and @xmath71 inverse propagators has to remain invariant under ghost subtraction @xcite , i.e ;",
    "@xmath93 , and we obtain from ( [ eq : gkl ] ) and ( [ eq : dg ] ) @xmath94 it can be shown @xcite that the kl propagator can be obtained from the sd propagator by subtracting the ghost pole : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the residue of the pole at euclidean @xmath97 .",
    "we show @xmath98 for @xmath18 and @xmath78 by the solid line in fig .",

    "( [ eq : sum ] ) . the exact evaluation of @xmath38 , given by eq . ( [ eq : gferm ] ) , requires the diagonalization of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath100 , and this is done most conveniently in a basis @xmath101 which diagonalizes the free dirac hamiltonian @xmath102 : @xmath103 with @xmath104 in a box of size d with discrete momenta @xmath105 .",
    "( here @xmath106 labels all necessary quantum numbers except colour . )",
    "d and @xmath107 should be taken large enough such that all results are unchanged under further increase .",

    "the ghost subtraction is formulated most conveniently in the continuous and infinite pw basis , for which the result is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dg ] ) .",
    "therefore , we proceed in two steps : first , in order to demonstrate that the kr basis gives the same results as the pw basis provided that @xmath107 and @xmath108 are taken large enough , we evaluate @xmath38 in the small size approximation both in the kr and the pw basis and compare the results",
    ". then we evaluate @xmath38 exactly in the kr basis and add the ghost subtraction term ( [ eq : dg ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : v2n ] ) , and the corresponding result for the kr basis is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2 ] ) as @xmath109    since for the exact calculation one has to diagonalize @xmath110 , it is convenient here to treat @xmath111 as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the square of a finite dimensional matrix . in fig .",

    "when the kr basis is used , the effective action becomes a function of @xmath107 , and in order to reach convergence ( @xmath122 ) in the small - size approximation we had to go up as high as @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "this is in contrast to models with finite cut - off like the njl model , where @xmath125 is sufficient for solitons of normal size @xcite .",
    "the calculations in this paper are performed with values for @xmath126 ranging from ( 70,5.7 ) for small @xmath42 to ( 20,20 ) for large @xmath42 , such that @xmath127 is kept constant .",
    "[ fig : ss ] demonstrates that the results using the pw and the kr basis agree well if @xmath107 and also the box size @xmath108 are taken large enough .",
    "comparison with the full calculation , to be discussed below , shows that the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] is quite accurate up to @xmath128 .",
    "the fact that the ground state energy relative to the translational invariant vacuum is negative for these small r indicates the vacuum instability due to the landau ghost discussed above .    the total ground state energy in the small size approximation is shown in fig . [ fig : result ] .",

    "the total ground state energy relative to the translational invariant vacuum is positive , which demonstrates that amending the two - point functions such that they satisfy the kl representation is sufficient to stabilize the vacuum against the formation of arrays of strongly localized meson field configurations .",
    "in effective quark - meson theories , which have been designed to model qcd in the energy region of hadron masses , the landau ghost appears in the meson propagators at rather low energies of @xmath1 .",
    "its presence is a real problem for these theories and leads to an instability of the translational invariant vacuum . in this paper",
    "we have taken the viewpoint that the landau ghost should be brought under control without the ad hoc introduction of further parameters . based on the work of redmond and bogoliubov et al @xcite , who have shown how one can improve the loop expansion such that the propagators have the correct analytical properties , we have shown a practical way to eliminate the landau ghost from chiral solitons in the @xmath0-model .",
    "we have demonstrated that the ghost free effective action formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied successfully to finite systems . in particular , since the ghost subtraction term is expressed most conveniently in a continuous and infinite plane wave basis , we have investigated in detail the conditions under which it is feasible to add this term to the fermion loop term which is evaluated in a discrete and finite basis . by considering vacuum configurations characterized by various sizes of the meson profiles we have shown that in our ghost free model the translational invariant vacuum has the lowest energy and is therefore stable with respect to decay into small sized configurations .",
    "the method given in this paper can form the base for further investigations on self consistent soliton solutions in the @xmath0-model .",
    "in particular , as mentioned in the introduction , it would be interesting to see whether self consistent solutions can be obtained with a reasonable strength of the @xmath4 term .",
    "the problem of the landau ghost and the associated vacuum instability occurs also in relativistic meson - nucleon theories for nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "for example , if a finite nucleus is described in the relativistic hartree approximation including the effect of the dirac sea , one has to apply the same overall ghost subtraction as performed in this paper ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gkl ] ) ) . in more sophisticated approximations like",
    "the 1/n expansion @xcite or the modified loop expansion @xcite the landau ghost appears also in the subgraphs ( even for infinite systems ) , and the ghost subtraction must be applied to these subgraphs .",
    "thus , although we used the language of effective quark theories in this paper , the method is applicable to relativistic nuclear structure physics as well .",
