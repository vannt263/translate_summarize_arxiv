    "the motivation for the present paper was the following result announced in @xcite and proven in @xcite , which we formulate next .",

    "[ fig : equidistributed ] for an illustration .",
    "we suppress the dependence of the sets @xmath25 , @xmath26 on @xmath27 and the choice of the @xmath21-equidistributed sequence in the notation .",
    "these sets will play in the following the role of _ observability sets _ as used in the context of control theory .",

    "the term _ scale - free _ refers to the fact that we have the same constant for all @xmath9 .",

    "thus the term @xmath38 appearing in the exponent of @xmath39 could be interpreted in two ways : either as the _ length _ or as the _ supremum _ of the energy interval . to understand which of the two quantities is relevant for our scale - free unique continuation estimate",

    "the answer to this question may depend on the space dimension @xmath7 and the ( regularity ) properties of the potential @xmath45 .",

    "in this paper we obtain a positive answer to a variant of question [ question ] , namely when the potential @xmath45 is identically zero , i.e. the hamiltonian is the pure laplacian , and when the energy spectral subspace is replaced by a momentum subspace .",
    "in this situation we are able to apply methods from fourier analysis and complex function theory which are more detailed than corresponding tools from the analysis of partial differential equations .",

    "i.e.  @xmath135 , the estimate ( 5 ) is better than estimate ( 11 ) , since it shows a polynomial dependence on @xmath136 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the different proofs used for theorem 6 and 10 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , theorem 10 is obviously more general since ist allows the support of the fourier transform @xmath137 to be supported in more than one parallelepiped of sides @xmath138 .",
