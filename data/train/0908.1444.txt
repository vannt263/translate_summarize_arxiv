    "indeed , in a world with only one risky security it is the case that the optimal investment fraction is exactly @xmath14 .",
    "we will see that the optimization problem is greatly simplified by denominating our investment fraction in these units  we define @xmath15 so that @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes sharpe ratio",

    "+   + it s worth noting what our choice of variables has gained us : the previous equation makes transparent the fact that , in order to maximize her ( change in ) utility , our classical mean - variance optimal investor should allocate her risk budget among risky assets `` in proportion to '' their sharpe ratios . specifically ,",
    "if she s choosing how to spread her capital among @xmath3 uncorrelated assets then @xmath28 and she ll invest a fraction @xmath29 of her capital in the i - th risky asset so that the risk , @xmath30 , is equal to @xmath31 .",
    "nothing new so far ",
    "but what if the drifts and covariances are themselves uncertain ?",
    "now our investor s future utility is uncertain not only because of the noise intrinsic to the risky assets , but also because her ability to characterize those risky assets is imperfect .",
    "this is a bad thing for her because @xmath32 is negative ( recall @xmath33 ) , and therefore @xmath34 declines as the uncertainty of her estimated @xmath12 increases - even if she has the right values on average .",
    "we ll choose portfolio weights so as to maximize her expected future utility , where the expectation is taken over _ both _ the return uncertainty for a given process _ and _ the parameter uncertainty for that process .",
    "let s define @xmath35 to be her estimate of @xmath36 , the true expected return for asset @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the estimated values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we ll define @xmath42 so that @xmath43 note that the @xmath24 and @xmath44 simply represent the same real - world investment fractions @xmath12 in different units .",

    "note that when there s no uncertainty in expected returns or covariances then @xmath60 and we regain the standard answer .",
    "a bit more generally , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 , i.e. if relative uncertainties in drift and volatility are assumed to be the same across all securities , then @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 times the standard result - which just corresponds to a change of leverage .",
    "since most real - world investors specify their risk - tolerance exogenously and use optimizers only to determine relative position sizes , the above prescription for incorporating parameter uncertainty has no real effect in this circumstance . in other words , the prescription is likely to be useful only when relative uncertainties in expected return and volatility differ across securities and/or uncertainties in correlations are introduced .",
    "this is all fine and dandy , you say , but what should i actually _ do _ ?",
    "how can one quantify these @xmath65 and @xmath66 objects ?",
    "well , if an investor s estimation procedure is quantitative then the fitting procedure might return covariances for the estimated parameters that allow @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be computed directly . if not , then simple tools can allow an investor to quantify her degree of certainty . in the following paragraphs",
    "i describe a few reasonable but ad hoc parameterizations that allow closed form expressions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( ignoring correlations among uncertainties ) .",
    "plots of these functions with `` sliders '' for the input parameters can be built as part of an optimizer s gui to enable the non - quantitative portfolio manager to include the uncertainty of her estimates , as well as the estimates themselves , in the portfolio construction process .",
    "+   + the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : first we propose simple and reasonable distributions that an investor can use to describe her uncertainty about expected returns , volatilities and correlations . then we explain how to compute @xmath65 and @xmath66 using these distributions .",
    "having set the stage , we conclude with a detailed , quantitative example",
    ". +   + * estimate of * @xmath67 +   + example 1 : let s assume we have an unbiased estimate of the expected return of the i - th security @xmath68 so that @xmath69 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath70 note that @xmath71 is just the relative uncertainty in the estimate of the expected excess return of the i - th security .",
    "a simple exercise in gaussian integral evaluation gives us : @xmath72 this series converges quite quickly , even for unrealistically small values of @xmath73 , i.e. even when there s a high degree of certainty that @xmath74 is close to the true value of @xmath75 . the resulting function @xmath76 looks like this :    this shape is easy to understand qualitatively : if the uncertainty in @xmath77 is zero then @xmath77 is equal to its mean value of zero and @xmath78 . for values of @xmath71 small enough that there s negligible probability of @xmath79 then the positive convexity of @xmath80 ensures that @xmath81 . but for very large values of @xmath71 , @xmath82 becomes so broad that @xmath83 by symmetry .",
    "+   + example 2 : how should we compute @xmath84 if we re concerned that our forecast alphas are biased upward as a result of data mining ? in this case , it s instructive and qualitatively reasonable to assume that @xmath85 where @xmath86 note that we ve `` deflated '' our expected returns but we re still ascribing predictive power to our data - mined results since an observation of @xmath87 is deemed to be 2-sigma event .",
    "note , too , that this assumption fixes @xmath88 : @xmath89 +   + * estimate of * @xmath90 a convenient way to parameterize our estimate of the i - th security s return volatility is @xmath91 where i m denoting the uncertainty by @xmath92 for reasons of convenience and familiarity , but the @xmath92 in this discussion of is not related to the @xmath92 in the discussion of @xmath93 above .",
    "this parameterization ensures that @xmath94 and allows us to compute @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath92 can be chosen to represent the uncertainty of the volatility forecast using the relation @xmath97 or by fitting a stochastic volatility model .",
    "+   + * estimate of * @xmath98 dropping subscripts , we start as before by writing @xmath99 where @xmath100 $ ] has zero mean if @xmath101 is assumed to be an unbiased estimator .",
    "this gives @xmath102 where @xmath103 $ ] has zero mean .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath104 has zero mean but is distributed over a range symmetric about @xmath105 implies that the pdf for @xmath104 will have positive skew .",
    "we can learn quite a bit about the form of @xmath106 as a function of @xmath107 without doing any calculations : to begin with , we know that symmetry requires that @xmath108 as @xmath109 ( assuming @xmath110 unimodal ) . we also expect that @xmath111 as @xmath112 because @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",
    "finally , we see that @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 because @xmath118 when the support for @xmath104 is near zero , as it is when @xmath119 .",
    "thus , @xmath106 as a function of @xmath107 should behave qualitatively as follows :     + a useful form for the probability distribution of @xmath101 that s simple to work with is : @xmath120 the user needs to find two exponents that characterize her estimate , normalize the distribution , and use it to compute @xmath106 . by doing so , one can easily verify that the preceding figure is indeed a reasonable guide to the value of @xmath106 for a given value of @xmath121 .",
    "consider a world with just two risky assets .",
    "the ( annualized ) parameters that will govern the time evolution of their prices are : @xmath122 these parameters are unobservable and can only be estimated .",
    "if an investor _ did _ know the true parameters , symmetry implies that she d choose @xmath123 and achieve a ( leverage - independent ) sharpe ratio = ( expected excess return / return volatility ) @xmath124/@xmath125 at whatever leverage her utility function happened to dictate ( the factor of @xmath126 is just the diversification effect of our assumption that the return processes are uncorrelated ) .",
    "any parameter uncertainty will reduce the sharpe ratio to less than @xmath127 , because @xmath128 will lead to a sub - optimal weighting in which @xmath129 .",
    "+   + of course , the parameters are _ not _ known and must be estimated .",
    "let s assume that an investor s estimates will be unbiased and may be thought of as being drawn from the following sampling distributions : @xmath130 recalling that @xmath131    @xmath132 we see that our assumptions imply that @xmath133{\\text { and } } b = \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } }     { 1.03 } & { 1.11 }   \\\\     { 1.11 } & { 1.31 }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right]\\ ] ] we now run the following experiment : + step 1 : initialize three accounts with $ 1 of capital , i.e. @xmath134 + step 2 : draw @xmath135 from the above distributions . + step 3 : compute @xmath136_i}\\frac{{{{\\hat s}_i}}}{{{{\\hat \\sigma } _ i}}},\\ ; \\\\    { f_i}^{better } = \\frac{1}{{1 - x}}{[{(\\hat \\phi   * b)^ { - 1}}(\\vec{\\hat{\\delta } }   * \\vec a)]_i}\\frac{{{{\\hat s}_i}}}{{{{\\hat \\sigma } _",

    "step 4 : generate one - step returns @xmath137 for securities 1 and 2 using their true parameters and apply them to the holdings : @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 step 5 : goto step 2 .",
    "+   + we repeated this loop 100,000 times , then computed the three portfolio return series @xmath141 and found : +   + sharpe ratio@xmath142 = 0.27 + sharpe ratio@xmath143 = 0.37 + sharpe ratio@xmath144 = 0.46 +   + these are qualitatively as we expect :    1 .",
    "the true parameters gave the expected result of about 0.47 , up to sampling error .",
    "2 .   the naive application of the standard mean - variance framework using the estimated parameters gives 0.27 , a much worse result than the theoretically optimal 0.47 due to the negative convexity of the expected change in utility with respect to the investment fractions .",
    "the approach outlined in this paper gives 0.37 , a result significantly better than 0.27 but still worse than 0.46 .",
    "finally , note that we ve also run experiments in which we allowed the investor s estimates of her uncertainty to themselves be wrong , i.e. we ve run the above experiment with @xmath145 computed using noisy @xmath146 ( stemming from imperfect knowledge of how noisy are the parameter estimates ) .",
    "the improvement in risk - adjusted performance is found to be very robust , i.e. substantial errors in @xmath146 do not appreciably diminish the performance and sharpe ratio@xmath143 was well above sharpe ratio@xmath142 in every experiment ."
