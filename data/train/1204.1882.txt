    "electron spin polarization ( esp ) of charge carriers ( electrons and holes ) in solid - state systems is the important phenomenon , which is observed in ferromagnetic metals and inorganic semiconductors and result from strong magnetic interactions in these solids.@xcite the esp effect is very interesting from general physical point of view and important for applications.@xcite    as for organic semiconductors ( oscs ) , magnetic interactions in them are typically fairly weak and no strong esp is expected .",
    "the esp can , nevertheless , be injected from ferromagnetic solids.@xcite in many experiments the oscs are applied as spacers ( between ferromagnetic leads ) , in which one can manipulate the esp by applying electric and magnetic fields.@xcite the dynamics of electron spins in oscs is studied quite thoroughly,@xcite but the majority of works concern the analysis of spin evolution of polarized charge carriers injected into oscs from polarizing leads ( see , for example , refs .",
    "[ 4 - 10 ] , as well as [ 2,3 ] and references therein ) . this work concerns the discussion of the mechanisms of esp generation directly in oscs ( in the absence of spin injection ) .",
    "the possibility of this effect is usually ignored because of above - mentioned weakness of magnetic interactions in these materials .",
    "the analysis shows , however , that some spin selective processes in oscs can result in fairly strong esp ( much larger than the thermal one ) .",
    "such processes are similar to those , which determine the magnetic field and spin effects ( mfes ) in spin selective reactions of paramagnetic particles [ usually doublets ( @xmath0 ) and triplets ( @xmath1)].@xcite    in our investigation we will consider two types of processes , doublet - doublet ( @xmath2 ) recombination@xcite and triplet - doublet ( @xmath3 ) quenching,@xcite in which the esp generation is expected to be very efficient . the esp results from quantum transitions between the terms of the spin hamiltonian of the pair of particles ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) , assisted by their stochastic relative motion .",
    "the terms are determined by the zeeman and spin exchange interactions and transitions are induced by the hyperfine ( hfi ) , anisotropic part of the zeeman ( azi ) , or zero field splitting ( zfs ) interactions , depending on the process considered .",
    "the strong dependence of the exchange interaction on the interparticle distance @xmath4 leads to the significant localization of transitions in space and essential dependence of the esp generation efficiency on the characteristic properties of relative motion .",
    "noteworthy is that the theory of diffusion assisted esp generation in liquid phase reactions has already been developed.@xcite it is based on the stochastic liouville equation ( sle ) approach,@xcite which allows one to rigorously describe the generation of mfes , ( including the esp ) . as applied to similar processes in oscs , however , this sle - based theory needs certain modifications , due to some specific features of interaction and relative motion of paramagnetic particles in these materials .",
    "the effect of these specific features on the esp in oscs is considered within two models of relative motion of particles : cage and free diffusion .",
    "both models are shown to predict similar expressions for the esp both in geminate and bulk processes .",
    "the proposed theory enables one to take into account possible spin - independent ( i.e. coulomb ) interaction @xmath5 between reacting particles , which can strongly affect the mfes.@xcite simple estimations demonstrate that the attractive interaction @xmath5 results in significant increase of the esp .",
    "the evaluation of the esp for realistic values of parameters of the theory shows that the considered mechanisms can be very efficient leading to a quite large esp in oscs .",
