    "in the last few decades the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) on the square lattice has been thoroughly studied by means of several theoretical , numerical and experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "such research hands us a picture where three classes of substantially different models appear , the isotropic , the easy - axis , and the easy - plane antiferromagnets .",
    "the reference models for the two latter classes are the 2d - ising and 2d - xy antiferromagnets , defining their respective universality class and known to display a finite - temperature phase transition .",
    "it is also known that quantum effects , despite being enhanced by the reduced dimensionality , do not substantially change the essential features of the above models , not even in the extreme @xmath0 case , though evidently renormalizing their thermodynamic properties .",
    "this results from renormalization group  @xcite and semiclassical approaches  @xcite , as well as from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite .    in the above picture",
    ", however , there still is a grey area , where our knowledge is not detailed enough to allow a precise reading of the experimental data : this is the area of very weak anisotropies and strong quantum effects , which is of particular interest as most of the real layered compounds whose magnetic behaviour is properly modeled by the @xmath0 hafm on the square lattice are characterized by anisotropies as small as @xmath2 times the exchange integral .",
    "these compounds exhibit a phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath3 which is often too large for the interlayer coupling to be the unique player , while the idea of a two - dimensional anisotropic criticality as the trigger of the transition appears well sound  @xcite : such idea is corroborated by the measured values of some critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation tells us that three - dimensional long - range order is present below @xmath3 and that well above @xmath3 no trace of anisotropic behaviour is left ; it is slightly above @xmath3 that one hence expects evidences of genuine 2d anisotropic behaviour to be detectable . in order to let these experimental evidences surface out of the sea of the isotropic thermodynamics ,",
    "precise numerical data for the @xmath0 nearly isotropic hafm are needed : it is the purpose of this work to fulfill such need . in particular , we address the problem of the existence and characterization of the phase transition , making use of continuous - time qmc cluster algorithms , which are well suited in the neighbourhood of a critical point , since they do not suffer from critical slowing - down .",
    "the general resulting picture is that a phase transition is induced by an arbitrary amount of anisotropy , and that several distinctive features of the expected universality class can be traced out .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ s.2dxxz ] the general properties of the anisotropic models are described , extracting the most significant difference with respect to the isotropic model . in section  [ s.defqmcfse ]",
    "the qmc methods are presented , the thermodynamic quantities under investigation are defined , and the finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory used in our analysis is briefly recalled .",
    "the results for nearly isotropic models , as from both fss analysis and thermodynamic behaviour , are presented and discussed in sections  [ s.eaxxz ] and  [ s.epxxz ] for the easy - axis and easy - plane case , respectively . in section  [ s.phasediag ]",
    "the critical - temperature vs anisotropy phase - diagram is discussed .",
    "eventually , conclusions are drawn in section  [ s.conclusions ] .",
    "the xxz model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4~ ,   \\label{e.xxzmodel }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 runs over the sites of an @xmath6 square lattice , @xmath7 connects each site to its four nearest neighbours , @xmath8 is the antiferromagnetic exchange integral , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the easy - axis ( ea ) and easy - plane ( ep ) anisotropy parameters , respectively , hereafter getting positive values smaller than unity . as @xmath11 sets the energy scale , the dimensionless temperature @xmath12 will be used in the following .",
    "the spin operators @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) obey the _",
    "su_(2 ) commutation relations @xmath15= i\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\delta_{\\bm{ij } } \\hat{s}^\\gamma_{\\bm{i}}$ ] and are such that @xmath16 .    besides the isotropic model @xmath17 , eq",
    ".   defines the ea ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and ep ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) magnets , whose respective reference models are the ising model ( @xmath22 ) and the xy ( also known as xx0 ) one ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "what is known about these models can be summarized as follows :    _ i _ ) the isotropic model has no finite - temperature transition ; its ground state is ordered for any @xmath24 and a critical region of divergent correlations is clearly observed at very low temperatures ;    _ ii _ ) the ea models exhibit an ising - like transition at a critical temperature @xmath25 which is an increasing function of both @xmath9 and @xmath24 ; for @xmath26 , @xmath25 is finite for all anisotropies ;    _ iii _ ) the ep models exhibit a transition of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , at a critical temperature @xmath27 which is an increasing function of both @xmath9 and @xmath24 ; for @xmath26 , @xmath27 is finite for all anisotropies .",
    "some of the above statements are rigorously proved , others come from the combination of theoretical , numerical and experimental results .",
    "more precisely , for what concerns ground state properties , an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state has been exactly proved  @xcite for @xmath0 only in the case of strong anisotropy , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for weaker anisotropies",
    "clear numerical evidence exists of an ordered ground state down to the isotropic limit , as coming from qmc and exact diagonalization studies  @xcite . as for the finite - temperature properties , according to renormalization group analysis  @xcite , the critical temperature vanishes in the isotropic limit as @xmath30^{-1}$ ] . in the ea case the existence of the transition for arbitrary @xmath9 has been rigorously proved only in the classical limit @xmath31 , while in the quantum case the proof is restricted to a spin - dependent finite amount of anisotropy  @xcite . in the ep case",
    "the situation is even less clear , since also in the classical limit a rigorous proof  @xcite of the existence of a transition is limited to the case @xmath32 , while no rigorous proof exists in the quantum case .    in the @xmath0 case ,",
    "evidences of a phase transition for anisotropies as small as @xmath33 in the ea case  @xcite and @xmath34 in the ep case  @xcite were suggested by previous qmc approaches ; however , these computations employed local algorithms which can not easily access the critical region and a rigorous fss analysis could not be performed .",
    "the situation is still unclear also because recent works based on real - space renormalization - group  @xcite predict the existence of a critical value of the anisotropy in the ea case ( @xmath35 ) below which the transition would be destroyed by quantum fluctuations . in this work",
    "we hence consider @xmath0 and four nearly isotropic systems , two ea , @xmath33 and @xmath36 , and two ep ones , @xmath34 and @xmath37 .",
    "as usually done in the existing literature on qmc , in this section and in appendices  [ a.worm ] and  [ a.helicity ] we employ the notation @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the qmc method for the @xmath0 xxz model",
    "is based on the trotter - suzuki decomposition of the partition function , which can be approximated by the following expression  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the amplitude of propagation of a pair of nearest - neighbour spins from a configuration @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the ( imaginary- ) time step @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the trotter number and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) the basis set diagonalizing the @xmath48 operator .",
    "the two bond configurations define a space - time _ plaquette _",
    "configuration @xmath49 , so that @xmath41 can be seen also as the weight of a given plaquette configuration @xmath50 .",
    "the index @xmath51 runs over all plaquettes on the space - time lattice , and the index @xmath52 runs over all configurations of the system . at each time",
    "step plaquettes are defined on different groups of bonds @xmath53 , so that all bonds involved in the propagation at the same time step do not share any spin ; moreover , each plaquette shares its corner spins with two plaquettes on the previous and two on the subsequent time step .",
    "the expression   becomes exact in the limit @xmath54 .    in the case of the xxz model , only the 6 plaquette configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ plaquettes ] have non - zero weights @xmath41 , whose expansion to first non trivial order in @xmath55 are  @xcite : @xmath56 plaquettes 1 ,  2 ,  3 , and 4 propagate the state of the spin pair unchanged , while plaquettes  5 and  6 introduce an exchange of state for the interacting spins , hereafter denoted as _",
    "any standard monte carlo ( mc ) method can be applied for numerically evaluating the partition function  ; in principle one could do single local metropolis moves which update clusters of plaquettes sharing corner spins in order to move to configurations with non - zero weight  @xcite .",
    "this approach is however inconvenient , being affected by the well - known critical slowing - down .",
    "moreover , in order to control the trotter - approximation error , it is necessary to repeat the simulation for increasing trotter number . in recent years",
    "efficient cluster algorithms were proposed to overcome the problem of critical slowing down in qmc simulations . in the context of quantum spin systems ,",
    "the _ loop - cluster algorithm _ and the _ worm algorithm _ have revealed very effective ; moreover , they can be also formulated in continuous imaginary time , thus removing completely the trotter - approximation error .",
    "one can completely eliminate the critical slowing - down by introducing the so - called _ loop - cluster algorithm _",
    "@xcite , which is the quantum analog of the swendsen - wang  @xcite and wolff  @xcite cluster algorithms introduced for classical spin systems . within the multi - cluster approach  @xcite ( analogue to the swendsen - wang scheme )",
    "the loop algorithm consists of probabilistically assigning to each plaquette a _ break - up decomposition _ ( or graph ) @xmath57 , i.e. , a way of grouping its spins in subgroups , so that the grouped spins can be flipped all at once bringing the plaquette into a configuration with non - vanishing weight ; in the case of the xxz model the above condition allows only grouping of spins into pairs ( _ non - freezing _ breakups ) or all together ( _ freezing _ breakup ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ breakups ] .    assigning a breakup @xmath57 to each plaquette",
    ", one univocally defines a breakup decomposition @xmath58 of the whole configuration @xmath59 into loops .",
    "different breakup decompositions @xmath57 are assigned to each plaquette configuration @xmath50 according to weights @xmath60 obeying the general sum rule @xmath61 .",
    "since the xxz model is symmetric under time reversal , it is straightforward to require that plaquettes connected by time - reversal must have the same weights , i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these weights must be positive and obey the detailed balance condition .",
    "the presence of frozen plaquettes leads to the generation of very big loops , whose flip is expected to be less and less effective in generating successive uncorrelated configurations ; therefore , a general strategy to be followed is that of minimizing the probability of frozen plaquettes to appear .",
    "if one sets @xmath65 for each p , a solution with positive breakup weights is obtained only in the case @xmath66 , i.e. , in the ep and isotropic case .",
    "when @xmath67 , i.e. , in the ea case , one must allow for freezing of at least a single plaquette configuration to achieve positiveness .",
    "in particular , in the antiferromagnetic case , it is @xmath68 that must be different from zero in order to have positive weights . by further imposing independence of the breakup decomposition from the plaquette configuration , i.e. , @xmath69 one gets that , within the same loop decomposition @xmath70 , all of the configurations @xmath71 obtained from the starting one @xmath72 by flipping some of the loops , are reached with the same probability , i.e. , each loop is flipped independently of all the other ones .",
    "the complete set of non - zero breakup weights used in our calculation thus reads  @xcite ( to first order in @xmath55 ) :    * easy - plane and isotropic case ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 * easy - axis case ( @xmath75 ) : @xmath76    the fact that freezing is required in the ea case can be physically interpreted as a reflection of the enforced antiferromagnetic correlations of the @xmath77-component of the spins : as a matter of fact , freezing of plaquettes of type 3 and 4 implies preservation of nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic correlation along the mc flow , i.e. , antiferromagnetic configurations are more `` resistant '' to mc fluctuations , with respect to ferromagnetic ones .    in the limit of continuous imaginary time  @xcite , @xmath78 ,",
    "plaquettes with no _ kink _ , i.e. , of types 1 ( 2 ) and 3 ( 4 ) , acquire unitary weight , while plaquettes with a kink , i.e. , of type 5 ( 6 ) , get an infinitesimal weight , still keeping a finite weight per unit time @xmath79 ; therefore kink - bearing plaquettes must be regarded as poissonian events in the imaginary - time evolution of each pair of interacting spins . at the same time the breakup decomposition creating no kink in imaginary time evolution , acquires a unitary weight , while all the other breakups acquire infinitesimal weight , still keeping a finite weight per unit time @xmath80 . in the case of plaquette 5 ( 6 ) , since the breakup weights have to be normalized to the plaquette weights , they become finite probabilities @xmath81 in the ep case , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 in the ea case .",
    "the algorithm then proceeds as follows :    * distribute breakups @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 on the continuous segments (= infinite sequences of infinitesimal plaquettes 1(2 ) and 3(4 ) ) along the imaginary - time evolution of each pair of interacting spins , according to the poisson distribution having as parameter @xmath87 ; for each kink in the propagation , choose a breakup with probabilities @xmath88 .",
    "* reconstruct the loops defined by the decomposition of each infinitesimal plaquette ; * decide whether to flip each loop independently with probability one half .",
    "the above procedure ( multi - cluster update ) represents a single mc step in our code .",
    "we have generally performed @xmath89 mc steps for thermalization for each value of the temperature , and @xmath90 mc steps for evaluation of thermodynamic observables .",
    "the algorithm is very efficient in both the ea and the ep case , with autocorrelation times which always remain around unity for all the lattice sizes @xmath91 we considered , i.e. , @xmath9216 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 200 .",
    "the autocorrelation time @xmath93 has been estimated by the _ blocking technique_@xcite as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the variance of the time - series @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) produced for the variable @xmath98 , while @xmath99 is the variance of the block variable @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , with @xmath102 for the estimate to be sensible .",
    "the introduction of freezing breakups has the effect of making a loop branch into subloops ; as the flip of large branched clusters is less effective in generating successive uncorrelated configurations , the inclusion of freezing is generally thought to lower the efficiency of the loop algorithm  @xcite , although no direct evidence of such conclusion exists .",
    "nevertheless , for the ea anisotropies we consider , no significant loss of efficiency ( i.e. , increase in correlation time ) is observed .",
    "moreover , in the ising limit , the above algorithm reproduces the swendsen - wang algorithm for the ising model , which is known not to suffer from slowing down ; therefore efficiency is possibly lost only for intermediate values of the anisotropy , which is not the case we are interested in .",
    "we have implemented improved estimators  @xcite for all the quantities of interest . a separate",
    ", more careful analysis is needed in the case of off - diagonal observables , whose most general bilinear example may be @xmath103 . in absence of freezing",
    ", the improved estimator simply reads  @xcite : @xmath104 , if @xmath105 and @xmath106 belong to the same loop , @xmath107 otherwise .",
    "this result can be understood by observing that the quantity we are considering may be seen as the ratio between the partition function of the system with density operator @xmath108 and the partition function of the original model considered , with density operator @xmath109 .",
    "the final outcome for the estimator given above thus follows from the observation that in absence of freezing , i.e. , in the isotropic or ep class , according to eqs .",
    "the weight assigned to a loop decomposition is actually independent of the configuration onto which it is defined , since each kind of breakup has the same weight on every plaquette configuration where its weight is non - zero ; therefore the same loop decomposition is reached with equal probability in the original and in the modified system , with the additional constraint , in the case of the modified system , that the two points @xmath105 and @xmath106 must belong to the same loop .    when freezing is present , the above argument breaks down , since only one plaquette configuration admits freezing and the constraint of having @xmath105 and @xmath106 on the same loop is no longer sufficient to have a non - zero contribution to the estimator . in principle",
    "it is possible to define the estimator for off - diagonal observables even in case of freezing ; however , not only its implementation is highly non trivial from the point of view of programming , but its evaluation would also consume a considerable amount of computational time . as a matter of fact , for each pair of points",
    "@xmath106 belonging to the same branch of a loop , one should look for freezing breakups by checking all the loop segments between the two points , an operation that , being the loops structure involved , becomes very costly at low temperatures .",
    "we have therefore renounced to implement such estimators in case of freezing . to have a complete picture of the thermodynamics of the system in the ea case we have then resorted to a different ( and generally less efficient ) qmc scheme , within which the calculation of the off - diagonal observables in the ea case is relatively straightforward , i.e. , to the so - called worm algorithm .",
    "the _ worm _ algorithm represents an alternative way to overcome the problem of critical slowing down in qmc simulations .",
    "the original idea of the algorithm can be found in ref .  , but we here formulate the algorithm in a different way , so that it appears as a direct generalization of the loop algorithm ; our formulation is more directly related with the so - called `` operator - loop update '' introduced in the framework of the stochastic series expansion  @xcite .",
    "the worm algorithm starts by choosing a point at random in space - time , inserting two discontinuities in the local imaginary - time evolution , and then keeping one fixed ( the `` tail '' of the worm ) while letting the other ( the `` head '' of the worm ) freely travel through the lattice .",
    "the single - worm update ends when the head happens to `` eat '' the tail ( the worm closes ) , so that the isolated discontinuities disappear and the system is led to a new configuration having non - zero weight .",
    "all the segments of imaginary - time evolution touched by the worm s head have to be flipped , i.e. , the worm s head performs a real - time update of the system .",
    "its motion conventionally goes forward ( backward ) in imaginary time while updating segments with up ( down ) spins , and it is ruled by detailed balance condition , to be locally satisfied on each ( infinitesimal ) plaquette it touches . in the context of the worm algorithm one has to abandon the concept of plaquette breakup , and the decision about how a plaquette is passed through by the worm must be taken from time to time .",
    "one of the distinctive feature of the algorithm is that the worm can pass through the same plaquette many times , each time in a different way , depending on the local configuration left at its previous passage .",
    "general detailed balance conditions for the single plaquette update when the worm s head passes through it , flipping two spins , read @xmath110 where we have already introduced the time- and space - reversal symmetries , so that here `` 1 '' means 1 or 2 , `` 3 '' means 3 or 4 , and `` 5 '' means 5 or 6 , depending on the way the worm s head travels through the plaquette .",
    "moreover , the transition probabilities must satisfy the sum rules @xmath111 moving to the continuous - time limit , we express the transition probabilities from a plaquette with a non - vanishing weight to another plaquette , as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 have the meaning of ( positive ) transition probabilities per unit imaginary time , while @xmath115 and @xmath116 are ( negative ) corrections to the transition probabilities among plaquettes taking non - vanishing weights ; these corrections arise from the poissonian occurrence of kinks in imaginary - time evolution . with the above parameterization of the transition probabilities ,",
    "the first two of the sum rules   take the form @xmath117 while the third remains unchanged , as @xmath118 and @xmath119 keep their meaning of dimensionless probabilities for the different ways the worm s head can pass through a kink in imaginary - time evolution .",
    "the set of detailed balance equations in the continuous - time limit takes the form @xmath120 together with the sum rules , they give as unique solution the following set of transition probabilities : @xmath121 it is immediate to see that this solution is equivalent to the set of breakup weights  , which means that , at this level , the worm algorithm is nothing but the wolff - type ( single - cluster ) version of the loop algorithm .",
    "however , as seen in the loop algorithm , in the ea case transition probabilities are not always positive , and some other transition mechanism must be invoked to overcome this problem . as seen before , the remedy in the case of the loop algorithm was to allow for branching of the loops ; if one hence allows for branching also in the worm algorithm , the single - cluster version of the loop algorithm for the ea case is obtained .",
    "a different strategy can be adopted in the case of the worm algorithm by introducing a new type of motion , named _ bouncing _ , where the worm s head , when attempting to update a plaquette , is bounced off and hence forced to locally trace back its route . from the physical point of view",
    ", the existence of a bounce mechanism protects some plaquettes from being updated , possibly those plaquettes containing local spin configurations which give a relevant contribution to the thermodynamics of the system ; such local configurations are preserved along the mc flow and the effect of bouncing is seen to be very similar to that of freezing in the context of the loop algorithm . in the case of the ea antiferromagnet ,",
    "the most relevant local configurations are those containing antiferromagnetic correlations of the @xmath77-components , i.e. , in terms of plaquettes , p=3,4 .",
    "therefore , we allow for bounce on these plaquette configurations , introducing a finite bounce probability @xmath122 which has to be accounted for in the sum rule @xmath123 the detailed balance condition for the bounce probability is trivial , reading @xmath124 .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "form an underdimensioned set and @xmath125 can be hence chosen arbitrarily , with the only constraint of positive transition probabilities .",
    "as in the case of freezing , it is highly convenient to minimize the bounce probability : when the worm s head bounces , part of its update operations are lost as it locally traces back its way , so that the efficiency in updating the configuration , keeping the number of elementary update operations fixed , is lowered .",
    "the following solution for the transition probabilities , minimizing the bounce probability , is found @xmath126 the worm algorithm with the bounce process is a _ pure - quantum _ cluster algorithm : in the ising model , which is a substantially classical statistical model , the algorithm loses its cluster nature , since only bounce processes survive , thus confining the worm on a single site . in this case",
    "the worm algorithm reproduces the single - flip metropolis algorithm , as shown in appendix  [ a.worm ] .    as in the case of the loop algorithm ,",
    "each of our simulations consists of @xmath89 mc steps for thermalization and of @xmath127 mc steps for evaluation of thermodynamic observables . during thermalization",
    ", the number of worms to be produced at each step is adjusted so that the total length of the worms in the imaginary - time direction roughly equals the size of the ( d+1)-dimensional lattice , @xmath128 ; this number is then kept fixed during the measurement phase . in this way",
    ", autocorrelation times of the order of unity are achieved for all values of the ea anisotropy considered . at variance with the loop algorithm ,",
    "the efficiency is here expected to drastically decrease as the anisotropy increases , given that , as the model moves toward the ising limit , the cluster algorithm transforms into the local metropolis algorithm ; however , the case of strong anisotropy is not of our interest here .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the estimator for bilinear off - diagonal quantities like @xmath129 can be thought of as a partition function for a modified model , in which two spin discontinuities are inserted in the system configuration at the points @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "now it becomes clear that configurations giving a non - zero contribution to such a partition function are generated during the worm update whenever the discontinuities associated to the head and tail of the worm coincide with the above points , both in the ea and in the ep case .",
    "therefore the off - diagonal observables are measured on - the - fly during the motion of worm s head  @xcite , and each worm update produces a statistics for the estimators which grows linearly with the length of the worm . as in the case of the loop algorithm ,",
    "this kind of estimators give to the worm geometry a physical meaning : the further the worm head travels away from its tail , the larger will be the off - diagonal correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "improved estimators are not defined for diagonal quantities in the ea case ; to this respect , worm and loop algorithms are seen to be exactly complementary .    as final remarks",
    ", we mention that the worm algorithm retains its full efficiency also in presence of a uniform magnetic field applied to the spins , while the loop algorithm is known to exponentially slow down as the field is increased and/or the temperature is lowered  @xcite .",
    "details of the worm algorithm in a finite field are not relevant to the present work and will be given elsewhere .",
    "independently of us , syljusen and sandvik  @xcite have recently developed a very similar ( _ directed loop _ ) algorithm , in the framework of both stochastic series expansion and path - integral monte carlo .",
    "we briefly report here the definition of the relevant thermodynamic quantities measured in our qmc study , together with their respective estimators .",
    "the mc average of the estimator will be hereafter denoted as @xmath130 .",
    "the internal energy @xmath131 is estimated as the mc average of @xmath132 where @xmath133 takes the value @xmath134 if at imaginary time @xmath135 there is an infinitesimal plaquette configuration of type 1 ( 2 ) , @xmath136 if of type 3 ( 4 ) , @xmath137 if of type 5 or ( 6 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the continuous - time limit of the energy estimator as defined in ref .  .",
    "the specific heat @xmath138 is estimated from energy fluctuations as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the number of kinks present in each generated configuration .",
    "the variance of the specific heat has been estimated via binning analysis of the time series related to the energy estimator and the kink number .",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath141 is estimated as the mc average of @xmath142    the spin - spin correlation function is @xmath143 where @xmath144 in the equal - time correlator ( et ) and @xmath145 in the time - averaged ( ta ) one . in both cases",
    "the numerical calculation of the correlation function takes advantage of the existence of the improved estimator defined in the previous subsection .",
    "the generalized susceptibility is @xmath146 the time - averaged susceptibility corresponds to the thermodynamic definition ( second derivative of the free energy ) while the equal - time one corresponds to @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the static structure factor as measured , e.g. , in neutron scattering experiments . from the general definition above",
    "follow those of the uniform susceptibility @xmath149 and of the staggered one @xmath150 susceptibilities and correlation functions have been measured both along the @xmath77-axis ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) and in the @xmath153-plane ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) ; in the ea case , the latter have been evaluated by means of the worm algorithm . in what follows",
    ", we will show and comment our data relative to the uniform ta susceptibility and to the staggered et susceptibility , being such quantities the more relevant ones from the experimental point of view .",
    "the correlation length @xmath156 is defined _ via _ the long - distance exponential decay of the staggered correlation function , @xmath157 .",
    "a direct estimate @xmath158 of the correlation length may be hence found by fitting the long - distance behaviour of @xmath159 with a model - dependent function , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "such procedure , however , is strongly dependent on the quality and stability of the fit , and does not always lead to a univocally defined result in case of a finite - size system in presence of a phase transition , i.e. , of a diverging correlation length .",
    "an alternative strategy , which we have also used , is offered by the so - called second moment definition  @xcite @xmath160 which can be directly extracted by the simulation data , supplemented by a binning analysis of susceptibility time series in order to estimate the variance .    another relevant observable , in the ep case , is the helicity modulus @xmath161 , which is a measure of the response of the system to the application of a twist @xmath162 in the boundary condition along a given direction : @xmath163_{\\phi=0}~ , \\label{thermohelix}\\ ] ] where @xmath164 . in appendix  [ a.helicity ] we show that , starting from the above definition as explicitly written in terms of spin operators , the estimator of the helicity modulus of the @xmath0 xxz ep model reads @xmath165 where @xmath166 , @xmath167 being the total winding number of spin paths ( paths traced by a fixed spin configuration , up or down ) in the 1(2 ) lattice direction .",
    "remarkably , this estimator is directly related with that of the superfluid density of bosonic systems  @xcite .",

    "it is observed that the smaller the anisotropy , the bigger the lattice sizes required to enter the asymptotic scaling regime , where fss holds .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the critical region is shifted to lower temperature : the correlation length of the isotropic model , acting as a lower bound for that of the nearly isotropic ones , increases exponentially upon lowering the temperature , and therefore , keeping the lattice size fixed , the ratio @xmath186 , that drives the onset of asymptotic scaling near the transition , gets smaller .",
    "the values of the anisotropy here considered are @xmath187 ( also used in ref .  ) and @xmath188 .",
    "they are comparable with the characteristic anisotropies of real compounds ; yet , for such small anisotropy there is no universal consensus on the existence of a transition  @xcite . from previous works  @xcite the transition",
    "is expected in the temperature range @xmath189 in both systems . at higher temperature",
    "the behaviour gets closer to that of the isotropic model , which has been extensively investigated by means of qmc in recent years  @xcite ; we have extended our analysis up to @xmath190 in order to identify those deviations from the isotropic behaviour that can be experimentally detected above the critical region .    in our approach , evidences for the existence of an ising - like transition follow from a detailed fss analysis of the data ; subsequently , we analyze the temperature dependence of some relevant thermodynamic quantities , emphasizing the signatures of the ea nature .",
    "our analysis proceeds in three steps : we give evidence for a transition to occur , then the transition temperature is located , and eventually the ising critical scaling is tested .",
    "after the discussion made in section  [ ss.fss ] the fss analysis for @xmath188 is expected to be more delicate than for @xmath187 . indeed , for the lattice sizes used ( @xmath191 ) some quantities show to have well entered the asymptotic scaling regime , while others do not . anyway ,",
    "clear ( though not complete ) evidence for the ising universality class is given also for @xmath188 ; larger lattices would be required to reach a full characterization .",

    "the dominant effect of quantum fluctuations on such divergence is embodied in the spin stiffness renormalization ; therefore , if the ordering process we are here observing is the same as in the classical case , we expect @xmath257 , where the value @xmath258 has been taken for the renormalized @xmath0 isotropic spin stiffness@xcite . from the logarithmic fits of the quantum data we indeed find @xmath259 and @xmath260 as prefactors of the logarithm , which are remarkably near to the predicted value , despite the simplicity of the argument that led to it .    for @xmath227 and @xmath187 , where a direct comparison is possible , the critical temperatures are not fully consistent with the values given in refs .   and  .",
    "we notice that the latter were estimated as free parameters of fitting functions for the critical behaviour of the susceptibility and correlation length ; the precision of this approach is hindered by the fact that the critical regime of both quantities was not always properly entered in the simulations of refs .   and  , mainly due to technical limitations which are nowadays overcome .",

    "in this paper we have presented an extensive numerical study of thermodynamic and critical properties of weakly anisotropic two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets described by the 2d @xmath0 xxz model with both ea and ep anisotropy .",
    "use has been made of the continuous - time qmc method based on the loop algorithm , implemented here for the first time also in the ea case , and on the worm algorithm , here reformulated as a variant of the loop algorithm .",
    "the general outcome of the numerical simulations is that the thermodynamics of 2d quantum antiferromagnets is extremely sensitive to the presence of anisotropies of magnitude comparable to those of real compounds , i.e. , as small as @xmath2 times the dominant isotropic coupling .    in the models",
    "studied we see a finite temperature transition to persist with clear signatures of ising and bkt critical behaviour , in the ea and ep case , respectively ; in the more anisotropic case ( @xmath261 ) full consistency with the expected universality class is found .",
    "the most striking evidences of the presence of the exchange anisotropy are observed in the thermodynamic behaviour of correlation lengths and susceptibilities .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the critical temperature on the anisotropy is found to be quantitatively consistent with the prediction relative to the classical case , with properly renormalized parameters .",
    "this tells us that quantum effects can neither destroy the transition , nor change the ordering mechanism responsible for the transition to occur and that our quantum models , despite having @xmath0 and very weak anisotropies , do actually behave as renormalized classical ones .",
    "given the results of ref .",
    "for @xmath26 , we can say that this conclusion generally holds for quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square lattice .    as for the thermodynamic behaviour of the specific observables considered , we find all the non - diverging quantities to be highly sensitive to the anisotropy , while critical quantities show deviations , with respect to the isotropic case , which are generally harder to detect .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in order to discriminate between @xmath262 isotropic and finite-@xmath263 anisotropic divergences one must come very close to the critical point of the anisotropic model , which is a non - trivial issue both numerically ( due to severe finite - size effects ) and experimentally ( due to finite experimental resolution and intralayer coupling ) .    as for the ep case , we underline that the considered values of anisotropy compare to that of several real compounds .",
    "on the other hand , we have clearly shown , for instance in figs .",
    "[ ep - chi0 ] , [ ep - xi ] and  [ ep - chi ] , that in the ep case traces of 2d anisotropic behaviour are detectable above the transition , due to the fact that some quantities display either a minimum or a maximum in a temperature region well apart from @xmath27 , where the in - plane correlation length has not diverged yet , and experimental observation should hence be more feasible .",

    "<S> we study the finite - temperature behaviour of two - dimensional @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets with very weak easy - axis and easy - plane exchange anisotropies . by means of quantum monte carlo simulations , based on the continuous - time loop and worm algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a rich set of data that allows us to draw conclusions about both the existence and the type of finite - temperature transition expected in the considered models . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the essential features of the ising universality class , as well as those of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) one , are preserved even for anisotropies as small as 10@xmath1 times the exchange integral ; such outcome , being referred to the most quantum case @xmath0 , rules out the possibility for quantum fluctuations to destroy the long or quasi - long range order , whose onset is responsible for the ising or bkt transition , no matter how small the anisotropy . besides this general issue </S>",
    "<S> , we use our results to extract , out of the isotropic component , the features which are peculiar to weakly anisotropic models , with particular attention for the temperature region immediately above the transition . by this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we aim to give a handy tool for understanding the experimental data relative to those real compounds whose anisotropies are too weak for a qualitative description to accomplish the goal of singling out the genuinely two - dimensional critical behaviour . </S>"
