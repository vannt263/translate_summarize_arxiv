    "the basic key predistribution scheme of eschenauer and gligor @xcite has been recognized as a typical solution to secure communication in wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) and studied extensively in the literature over the last decade [ 1][11 ] .",

    "@xcite as an extension of the basic eschenauer ",
    "gligor scheme @xcite ( the @xmath0-composite scheme in the case of @xmath1 ) has received much interest @xcite since its introduction .",
    "the @xmath0-composite scheme works as follows . for a wsn with @xmath3 sensors , prior to deployment , each sensor is independently assigned @xmath4 different keys which are selected _ uniformly at random _ from a pool of @xmath5 keys . then",
    "two sensors establish a _ secure _ link in between after deployment _ if and only if _ they share at least @xmath0 key(s ) _ and _ the physical link constraint between them is satisfied . @xmath5 and @xmath4 are both functions of @xmath3 for generality , with the natural condition @xmath6 . examples of physical link constraints include the reliability of the transmission channel and the distance between two sensors close enough for communication",
    ". the @xmath0-composite scheme with @xmath7 outperforms the basic eschenauer  gligor scheme with @xmath1 in terms of the strength against small - scale network capture attacks while trading off increased vulnerability in the face of large - scale attacks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate topological properties related to node degree in wsns employing the @xmath0-composite key predistribution scheme with general @xmath0 under the _ on_/_off _ channel model as the physical link constraint comprising independent channels which are either _ on _ or _",
    "off_. the degree of a node @xmath8 is the number of nodes having secure links with @xmath8 ; and the minimum ( node ) degree of a network is the least among the degrees of all nodes .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate that the number of nodes with certain degree is asymptotically equivalent in distribution to a poisson random variable , establish the asymptotic probability distribution for the minimum degree of the network , and derive the asymptotically exact probability for the property that the minimum degree is no less than an arbitrary value .",
    "yaan @xcite and we @xcite consider the wsns with @xmath1 and show results for several topological properties , yet results about node degree in these prior work are weaker than our analytical findings even when the general @xmath0 is set as @xmath2 .    our approach to the analysis is to explore the induced random graph models of the wsns .",
