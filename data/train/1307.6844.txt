    "important characteristics of materials such as metals , half metals , and doped semiconductors are their opto - electronic properties due to the electrons in partially filled bands .",
    "these properties are determined by the dielectric function @xmath0 , which is , in principle , a dynamical and wave - vector dependent quantity .",
    "@xcite in addition to the direct connection with optical `` constants '' , the dielectric function also serves as input for calculations of various electronic properties , such as lifetimes or electronic dynamics .",
    "@xcite for materials with a `` simple '' band structure , e.g. ,  metals and semiconductors , there exist approximate expressions for the dielectric function in the static and long - wavelength limit that are based on the electron - gas model for quasi - free electrons in the conduction band .",
    "@xcite this analytically tractable model is particularly useful for a qualitative understanding and can , in addition , be used as input in dynamical or lifetime calculations . on the other hand , starting as early as the 1950s , the dielectric function of `` simple '' materials has been measured  @xcite and , in recent years , calculated _ ab initio _ with impressive accuracy .",
    "@xcite both measurements and ab - initio calculations generally yield rather complex spectra that need to be interpreted with care , so that it would be helpful to have approximate results for the dielectric function based on the electron - gas model , even for materials where the band structure does not resemble a single band .",
    "for instance , one may want to study composition and crystal formation effects of heusler compounds or alloys , by measuring their plasma frequency to have a single result that characterizes a particular growth condition .",

    "@xcite showed that there is an influence on the plasmon dispersion from transitions _ between different bands_. this deviation from the single - band electron - gas model , even in the case of materials where it should apply best , leads to different views about what constitutes `` the '' plasma frequency : the intraband plasma frequency or the one corresponding to a peak in the loss function . only very recently a negative plasmon dispersion for the layered compound",
    "@xmath3 has been found and was ascribed to intraband transitions .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we complete the picture of different plasmon frequencies by taking a closer look at the dispersions of both candidates for the plasma frequency in simple metals and use the results to analyze the plasma behavior of the `` novel '' heusler compounds @xmath1 ( cfs ) and @xmath2 ( cms ) .",
    "our numerical approach uses a state - of - the - art calculation of the dielectric function in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) from first principles .",
    "the electronic energies and matrix elements are obtained from a density - functional theory ( dft ) calculation employing a full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) basis .",
    "@xcite the evaluation of @xmath0 is done using an accurate wave - vector dependent linear tetrahedron method .",
    "we calculate the `` full '' dielectric function @xmath0 including transitions between all bands and the dielectric function including only intraband transitions from which we extract intraband and full plasma dispersions .",
    "we show that at finite wave vectors  @xmath4 , the two plasmon dispersions have very different slopes . in particular , the intraband plasmon dispersion curves downward , i.e. , has a negative slope , which makes the difference between the two plasmons much more pronounced than it may seem from their @xmath5 behavior in some materials , most notably aluminum .",

    "aluminum has a well - defined acoustic plasmon resonance , whereas for silver we find a broad spectral signature instead of a sharp resonance .",
    "these different spectral shapes in the acoustic plasmon region are due to the different separations between the peaks in @xmath60 , cf .",

    "one finds  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an effective ( `` optical '' ) mass with typical values of @xmath68 ( see ref .   and references therein ) and @xmath69 the density of conduction electrons in aluminum .",
    "more generally , the intraband plasma frequency tensor can be computed in ab - initio fashion ,  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the fermi energy and @xmath72 the momentum matrix element between two bloch states .",
    "it seems to be accepted wisdom that , for the purposes of comparison with electron loss spectroscopies , one should use the plasma frequency as given by the peak of the loss function for the _ full _ dielectric function , even though such a well - defined peak in the loss function does not always exist . on the other hand , for the purpose of the description of the drude peak in optical spectra one should use the intraband plasma frequency .",
    "@xcite the intraband plasma frequency also has the advantage , that it can be calculated ab - initio by eq .",
    ", even if there is no well defined peak in the loss function obtained from the full dielectric function .",
    "further , this plasma frequency is related to the model of an electron gas with the actual density of valence electrons and an effective optical mass .",
    "thus , the relation between the plasma frequency and the ( correct ) electron density as mentioned above should only be used with the pure intraband calculation .",
    "if one takes the point of view that the plasma frequency is intimately connected with excitations in a _ single - band _ electron gas , the intraband plasma frequency seems the most faithful generalization of the plasma frequency to a real material , whereas interband transitions are mixed in the full dielectric function , even in the limit of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , early investigations of ehrenreich and philipp  @xcite for silver used this point of view to reconcile an apparent discrepancy between the full plasma frequency and the intraband plasma frequency by subtracting the interband contributions from the full dielectric function .",

    ", the full dielectric function leads to a loss function with a well - defined peak that can be used to obtain the full plasmon energy for a range of @xmath36 values .",
    "in addition to these full plasmon dispersions , we also calculate the @xmath36-dependent _ intraband _ plasmon energy , which we obtain from the root of the intraband @xmath73 .",
    "we use the zero of @xmath30 ( for fixed @xmath4 ) instead of the peak in the intraband loss function because the intraband plasmon resonance does not have a finite broadening in the rpa . as support for the validity of this procedure we note that",
    ", for @xmath5 , it coincides with the intraband plasma frequency as calculated via eq .  .",
    "the classification of intraband vs.  interband transition , which underlies our numerical results , is based on the labeling of the bands .",

    "[ fig : eeconti_and_plasma_al ] we show a comprehensive plot of the dispersions of the different plasmons along with edge of the intraband continuum for al .",
    "in particular , the ( red ) open circles are the _ intraband _ plasma frequencies and the blue crosses mark the upper border of the _ intraband _ electron - hole continuum and therefore describe the maximal energy transfer , @xmath78 , for intraband single - particle transitions with a change in the wave - vector .",
    "several markers at the same @xmath36-value correspond to different wave vectors @xmath4 with the same modulus .",
    "the spread of values at a given @xmath79-point therefore is a measure of the anisotropy of the spectrum .",
    "we also show as ( red ) open squares an `` extreme intraband '' calculation where we neglect transitions between kramers degenerate bands in the intraband dielectric function .",
    "finally , the plasma dispersion @xmath80 , determined from the peak of the full loss function is plotted as ( red ) diamonds . for small @xmath36 ,",
    "the full plasma dispersion reaches a value of @xmath81 , which is in agreement with results extracted from measurements , such as eels , where all transitions contribute .",
    "@xcite the intraband plasma frequency goes to @xmath82 , for @xmath5 , which is in agreement with values obtained from fits to electron - gas models , see , e.g. , ref .  , and corresponds to the result of eq .",
    "obtained with the elk - code .",
    "@xcite    the most striking result is a qualitative difference of the intraband plasmon dispersion from the electron - gas plasmon dispersion , where the plasma frequency _ increases _ as @xmath83 .",
    "the computed intraband plasma frequency _ decreases _ until it joins the electron - hole continuum .",
    "it is obvious that the intraband plasma frequency has to curve downward , because in some @xmath4-directions the high - energy boundary of the intraband electron - hole continuum is smaller than the ( intraband ) plasma frequency in the long wavelength limit , @xmath84 .",
    "this will become even more obvious in the case of silver below .",
    "note that we get a similar behavior of the intraband plasma frequency by evaluating the f - sum rule ( not shown here ) ,  @xcite @xmath85 which is @xmath4-independent for a single parabolic band .",
    "@xcite the negative dispersion thus clearly comes from a finite width of the bands , for which we take the intraband transitions into account .",
    "the decrease of the intraband coulomb matrix elements for larger momenta @xmath86 , which originates from the coulomb potential , leads to smaller contributions to @xmath60 for large wave vectors and can therefore also have an influence on this negative dispersion , which was also mentioned in ref .  .",
    "another remarkable property of the intraband plasma frequency is the pronounced contribution of transitions between kramers degenerate bands in , which can be seen by comparing the plasma frequencies obtained from the intraband dielectric function calculated with and without these contributions .",
    "this is a consequence of the spin mixing in the single - particle states ,  @xcite because the matrix elements @xmath26 between kramers degenerate bands would vanish if these were completely spin - polarized . without spin - mixing , the inclusion of transitions between kramers degenerate bands would make no difference .",
    "the full plasmon dispersion in fig .  [ fig : eeconti_and_plasma_al ] is in agreement with eels measurements  @xcite and calculations .",
    "@xcite note that the interband contributions reduce the spread for different @xmath4 directions , i.e. , the anisotropy , and , more importantly , change the overall shape of the dispersion qualitatively . that there is an influence of interband transitions on the effective plasma frequency",

    "[ fig : loss_heusler](b ) , the first peak in the loss function of cms at about @xmath118 is also an optical plasmon . even though the resonance is not as pronounced as in the case of cfs , it can still be well distinguished from the quasi - continuous spectrum . for cms , the intraband plasma frequency  ,",
    "as determined by standard dft - codes  @xcite and in previous calculations  @xcite is in the range of @xmath119 , which has no counterpart in the loss function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss_heusler](b ) .    as in the case of the simple metals aluminum and silver",
    ", we determine the dispersions of the full plasmons , i.e. , the one related to peaks in the loss function , and the `` intraband plasmon '' . due to their high spin polarization around the fermi energy ,",
    "the two heusler compounds show no kramers degeneracy , and we therefore need not distinguish between different intraband scattering processes .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasma_heusler ] we show our results for the full and intraband plasmon dispersions of cfs and cms . for both materials , the optical limit of the pure intraband calculation ( red squares )",
    "reproduces the intraband plasma frequency calculated from eq .  .",
    "@xcite as in the case of the simple metals the intraband plasmon shows a negative dispersion due to the finite width of the conduction bands .",
    "the full plasmon , i.e. , peak of the loss function , is a few evs away and moves to higher energies for larger momenta @xmath36 .",
    "the behavior of the different plasma frequencies is in many aspects similar to the case of silver , regardless of the much more complicated band structure of the heusler compounds .",
    "note also that both the full and the intraband plasmon dispersions get heavily damped when they reach the intraband electron - hole continuum .",
    "another difference between the two heusler compounds can be seen in terms of the acoustic plasmons indicated as `` + '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasma_heusler ] . in cfs",
    "we find three dispersive acoustic plasmons in the small energy regime , but in cms only one , which descends in the total loss function spectrum even for small wave vectors .",
    "although the differences between the plasma frequencies have been known at @xmath23 , we believe that the momentum dependent dispersions for both simple metals and complicated heusler compounds , show the distinction between the two different plasmon dispersions much more clearly : one increases and one decreases with @xmath36 .",
    "we stress that there does not seem to be a clear candidate for `` the '' plasmon .",
    "thus , when using plasmon energies as input for calculations or fitting measurements by plasmon energies , one should clearly distinguish between intraband and the full plasmon .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a comprehensive study of plasmon dispersions in simple metals and heusler compounds based on an accurate ab - initio evaluation of the rpa dielectric function .",
    "the dynamical dielectric functions were evaluated for all vector momenta @xmath4 and frequencies @xmath31 from dft - input using a wave vector - dependent linear tetrahedron method .",
    "the dispersion of the plasma frequency was obtained from the full dielectric function and from a calculation including only intraband transitions .",
    "we found that the plasma frequency derived from the intraband dielectric function agrees for @xmath5 with the intraband plasma frequency obtainable from standard dft codes , but shows a remarkable negative dispersion .",
    "based on these results , it was argued that neither the full nor the intraband plasmon can be put into correspondence with the single - band electron - gas model at finite @xmath36 without problems : the full dielectric function always contains the influence of interband transitions , and does not always yield a clear resonance , whereas the intraband plasma frequency yields a plasmon dispersion with a downward curvature . from the intraband plasmon dispersion",
    "it was also shown that there is a pronounced spin mixing in aluminum .",
    "for the bulk heusler compounds cfs and cms we presented spectra of dielectric and loss functions in the optical limit and obtained well defined plasmon resonances from the full dielectric function .",
    "we found that these are actually `` optical '' plasmon resonances dominated by interband transitions . for the intraband plasmon , on the other hand , we found a qualitative behavior that is quite similar for cfs and cms even though their band structures are very different .",
    "the intraband plasmon properties are not much different from those of the simple metals aluminum and silver : they also show a downward curvature .",
    "furthermore , we found signatures of acoustic plasmons in all materials .",
    "we stressed that our results provide , in general , a clear qualitative differentiation between the `` full '' and intraband plasmons at finite @xmath36 vectors that may be blurred at @xmath23 , where , for instance , in aluminum , the two plasmons may appear very similar .",
