    "contributions from the meson cloud of the nucleon to deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) were first discussed in the early 1970s by drell , levy and yan @xcite and sullivan @xcite .",
    "it was of little interest , however , until in the early 1980s a possible enhancement of the pion cloud of a bound nucleon was suggested as an explanation of the nuclear emc effect @xcite .",
    "while that issue is still of interest , the modern importance of the pion cloud in high - energy scattering originates in the work of thomas @xcite , who showed ( within a particular chiral quark model ) that the pion cloud contribution provided a natural explanation for the observed excess of non - strange over strange sea quarks in the nucleon .",
    "this calculation also predicted an excess of @xmath2 over @xmath3 quarks in the nucleon sea , which was confirmed by the violation of the gottfried sum rule observed in the nmc experiment at cern @xcite , and the @xmath4 ratio measured in the drell - yan reaction in @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering by the e866/nusea collaboration at fermilab @xcite .",
    "although this excess of @xmath2 over @xmath3 , as well as the @xmath7 asymmetry @xcite , was motivated by the physics of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , the early calculations were based on models whose connections to qcd were not manifest .",
    "it was later realized @xcite , however , that because of their origin in chiral loops , these contributions had a nonanalytic dependence on quark mass that could only be generated by a goldstone mechanism , which placed these effects on a more rigorous theoretical footing .",
    "in fact , it is a model - independent consequence of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nonzero .",
    "the only open question is how large these asymmetries actually are .",
    "this issue has become even more important in the last few years because of the widespread interest in the so - called five - quark components of baryon wave functions @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is some evidence that the roper resonance may not be a simple excitation of a single valence quark in the nucleon but rather involves a large five - quark contribution @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to questions about such components in the wave function of the nucleon , and there have been suggestions that these may be sizable . even though the pentaquark now appears to be defunct , legitimate questions about five - quark components in baryon spectroscopy",
    "remain , especially within models such as the chiral quark soliton model @xcite .    in the context of low energy tests of the standard model",
    "this issue is also very topical , with a potential asymmetry between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 parton distributions potentially yielding a large correction to the value of @xmath12 derived from the nutev measurement @xcite .",
    "model - dependent estimates of the five - quark component of the nucleon wave function involving three light quarks plus @xmath13 pairs were recently used to investigate this correction @xcite .    in all of these examples , the contribution from the meson cloud of the nucleon has been a crucial factor in reconciling the physics results . indeed , because of the model - independent constraints imposed through chiral symmetry on the nonanalytic behavior @xcite , the presence of meson cloud contributions to the various observables is firmly established , justifying the extensive theoretical attention that has been paid to this issue over the past decade .",
    "( we should note , however , that in chiral perturbation theory observables in general receive contributions from pions as well as local short - distance operators , or counter - terms , and it is possible under renormalization to move strength between them @xcite ; the nonanalytic contributions , on the other hand , remain model independent . )",
    "a further motivation relates to the fact that lattice qcd is now providing considerable information on the moments of parton distribution functions @xcite , but at larger quark masses than occur in nature .",
    "the extrapolation of those moments as a function of quark mass to the physical point is critically dependent on knowing the correct nonanalytic behavior @xcite , and that in turn is uniquely determined by the pion cloud of the nucleon .    given the phenomenological importance of the meson cloud , it is unfortunate that the literature contains a number of sometimes contradictory results for meson cloud contributions to dis . in particular , the majority of calculations , from the original work of drell _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and sullivan @xcite , to the early studies of the nonanalytic behavior @xcite , and essentially all model analyses of pion cloud effects in dis in between @xcite , have used pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling , which is , by itself , inconsistent with chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry can be achieved through the addition of a scalar `` @xmath14 '' field ; however , determining its practical consequences for dis is problematic because of uncertainties in identifying the nature of low - mass scalars in meson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "more recently , the matrix elements of nonsinglet twist-2 operators were computed by chen and ji @xcite and arndt and savage @xcite using lowest order , heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory . by construction this theory uses pseudovector ( pv ) @xmath15 couplings , which are manifestly invariant under chiral transformations @xcite .",
    "the twist-2 matrix elements are related through the operator product expansion to moments of parton distributions measured in inclusive dis . at lowest order in the low - energy expansion ( minimum number of derivatives of the pion field @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian for the interaction of pions and nucleons , consistent with chiral symmetry , can be written as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the nucleon field , @xmath19  mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath20 is the nucleon axial vector charge .",
    "the first term in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lpin ] ) gives rise to the well - known `` rainbow '' diagram in which a pion is emitted and reabsorbed by the nucleon at different space - time points .",
    "the second is the so - called weinberg - tomozawa term @xcite , in which two pion fields couple to the nucleon at the same point , and gives the leading contribution to s - wave pion ",
    "nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "it also generates the pion tadpole or bubble diagrams , which in the presence of external fields generally give non - vanishing contributions to nucleon matrix elements .",
    "this term does not appear in the ps theory , which leads to some of the differences between the moments of twist-2 parton distributions from pion loops computed in the ps @xcite and pv @xcite theories .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the light - cone momentum distributions of pions , and the corresponding recoil baryons , inside a physical nucleon within the chirally symmetric effective field theory defined by the lagrangian ( [ eq : lpin ] ) .",
    "we further contrast the results with those obtained in the ps theory , conventionally defined by the lagrangian @xmath21 where the @xmath1 coupling constant @xmath22 is related to @xmath23 and @xmath24 by the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , @xmath25 with @xmath26 the nucleon mass . unlike the earlier chiral effective theory calculations which only computed the light - cone distributions of pions @xcite or considered the nonanalytic behavior of their moments to lowest order in the pion mass @xmath27 @xcite , we compute the complete set of diagrams relevant for dis from nucleons dressed by pions resulting from the lagrangians ( [ eq : lpin ] ) and ( [ eq : lps ] ) , without taking the heavy baryon limit .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate explicitly the consistency of the computed distribution functions with electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "this requires consideration of the kroll - ruderman terms @xcite , which although entering at higher orders in @xmath27 , are nonetheless essential for ensuring conservation of charge to all orders in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "formally , the light - cone distribution functions can be defined by considering the vertex renormalization constant @xmath28 for the physical @xmath29 vertex .",
    "if the contributions from the pion cloud are not large , then @xmath30 and one has @xmath31 . the light - cone distributions @xmath32 associated with a particular contribution @xmath33 can then be defined as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the momentum fraction of the physical nucleon carried by the pion , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the four - momenta of the pion and physical nucleon , respectively .",
    "note that in this work we define the light - front `` @xmath38 '' and `` @xmath39 '' components of a four - vector @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "it will be most natural to perform the calculation in light - front coordinates ; however , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the nucleon self - energy , the results for the model - independent , long - distance physics associated with the pion cloud are reproduced in any formalism , be it instant form , covariant , or light - front .    because the tadpole or bubble diagrams in the pv theory involve pions emitted and absorbed at the same point , these can only contribute at zero light - cone momentum fraction , @xmath42 . a novel feature of the pv theory , however , is the appearance of @xmath0-function contributions arising also from the rainbow diagram at @xmath42 .",
    "inclusion of these singular terms is in fact vital for preserving gauge invariance in the pv theory . in the following",
    "we will elucidate the origin of the @xmath0-function terms and discuss their possible physical implications .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
