    "where @xmath94 is the constant in theorem [ mainlag ] , choose @xmath95 such that @xmath96 . then since @xmath89 is a homomorphism and since the hofer norm satisfies the triangle inequality we would have @xmath97 . but",

    "theorem [ mainlag ] is the first result known to the author about the hofer geometry of the orbit space @xmath82 of a cotangent fiber under the hamiltonian diffeomorphism group .",
    "however there are several prior results about the hofer metric on @xmath17 which imply conclusions closely related to those of theorem [ mainham ] , especially in the case that @xmath18 has nonpositive sectional curvature .",
    "first of all , @xcite contains results about the orbit @xmath99 of the zero section of a the cotangent bundle of an arbitrary compact smooth manifold , nicely complementing our results about the orbits of fibers or of certain conormal bundles .",
    "namely , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1(5,6 ) ) shows that , for any compact @xmath16 , the map @xmath100 which assigns to a smooth function @xmath101 the lagrangian submanifold @xmath102 induces an isometric embedding @xmath103 , where we write @xmath104)=\\max f-\\min f$ ] . using this ,",
    "one easily obtains isometric embeddings that map arbitrarily large balls in the normed vector space @xmath105 into @xmath17 .",
    "however , in view of the fact that @xmath17 contains only compactly supported diffeomorphisms , it does not seem possible to obtain embeddings of a whole vector space using such a construction ; moreover , in order to embed large balls one must use diffeomorphisms with large supports , in contrast to theorem [ mainham ] where the supports are fixed .    in @xcite , py showed that , whenever a symplectic manifold @xmath1 contains a @xmath106-injective compact lagrangian submanifold @xmath107 which admits a riemannian metric of nonpositive sectional curvature , for any integer @xmath53 there exists a bi - lipschitz embedding of @xmath108 into @xmath109 ( with the relevant constants diverging to @xmath110 with @xmath53 ) , whose image moreover consists of diffeomorphisms which may be taken to have support in an arbitrary deleted neighborhood of @xmath107 .",
    "thus in the case that @xmath111 and @xmath107 is the zero section , theorem [ mainham ] represents an improvement on py s result both in that the embedded subgroups are infinite - dimensional and in that the class of manifolds @xmath16 to which the theorem applies is more general than just those of nonpositive curvature . in the case that @xmath4 is instead compact , a similar improvement of py s result is a special case of ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) .",
    "more recently , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.13 ) it was shown that if a compact manifold @xmath16 admits a nonsingular closed one - form then @xmath17 admits an isometric embedding of @xmath112 .",
    "finally , l. polterovich has pointed out to the author a way of getting a conclusion closely related to that of theorem [ mainham ] in the special case that @xmath18 has nonpositive curvature ( for similar arguments in the contact context see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* examples 2.8 - 10 ) ) .",
    "namely , if for @xmath113 we let @xmath114 denote the radius-@xmath115 cosphere bundle , one can see from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.7(iii ) ) that @xmath114 is stably nondisplaceable ( since due to the curvature hypothesis @xmath16 has no contractible closed geodesics ) . then arguing as in ( * ? ? ? * proposition 7.1.a ) one can show that for any compactly supported smooth function @xmath116 , the hofer ( pseudo-)norm @xmath117 of the corresponding element @xmath118 in the _ universal cover _ @xmath119 is greater than or equal to @xmath120 .",
    "one can then let @xmath115 vary and consider hamiltonians of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the fiberwise norm on @xmath58 and where @xmath123 is a compactly - supported smooth function .",
    "the assignment @xmath124 is then an embedding @xmath125 which obeys an estimate analogous to ( [ maineq ] ) . in general",
    ", it does not seem clear from this argument whether the lower bound in this estimate survives after one projects down from @xmath119 to @xmath17 , though in some isolated cases such as where @xmath16 is the torus this could likely be deduced along the lines of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2.8 ) .",
    "also , we should mention that the diffeomorphisms that appear in the image of our embedding @xmath89 in theorem [ mainham ] have the form @xmath126 for certain functions @xmath127 ; thus the proof of theorem [ mainham ] will show that polterovich s estimate in the universal cover does survive after projection at least for these special choices of @xmath127 .      our proof of theorem [ mainlag ] is based on the properties of the filtrations of the floer complexes associated to certain pairs of noncompact lagrangian submanifolds in liouville manifolds ; in our case the liouville manifold is a cotangent bundle @xmath58 and the lagrangian submanifolds are cotangent fibers @xmath128 or , a bit more generally , conormal bundles @xmath81 of compact submanifolds @xmath19 .",
    "thus if @xmath129 , for any suitably nondegenerate , compactly supported hamiltonian @xmath5\\times t^*n\\to \\r$ ] we have a floer complex @xmath130 whose generators correspond to points of @xmath131 .    since we are considering compactly supported hamiltonians ( unlike the situation with the `` wrapped '' floer complexes of , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the homology of this floer complex is trivial , as @xmath132 . despite this triviality ,",
    "we can still obtain significant information ( depending , unlike the homology , on the hamiltonian @xmath133 ) from the floer complex , by means of the _ boundary depth _",
    ", a quantity that was introduced in a similar context in @xcite and is denoted here by @xmath134 .",
    "the boundary depth gives a quantitative measurement of the nontriviality of the floer boundary operator with respect to the natural filtration on the floer complex : it is the smallest nonnegative number @xmath135 such that every element @xmath136 of the image of the boundary operator has a primitive whose filtration level is at most @xmath135 larger than that of @xmath136 . as we show in section [ gens ] ( by arguments quite analogous to ones appearing in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) in the compact case ) , the boundary depth @xmath137 is independent of the choice of @xmath133 with @xmath138 and moreover , considered as a function of @xmath139 , is @xmath140-lipschitz with respect to the hofer distance @xmath63 on @xmath82 .",
    "consequently lower bounds for the boundary depth can give lower bounds on @xmath63 of the sort that appear in ( [ lagest ] ) .",
    "thus we prove theorem [ mainlag ] by constructing a homomorphism @xmath141 where @xmath142 for all @xmath143 while @xmath144 for a constant @xmath94 . for @xmath73",
    "we use a function of the form @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the fiberwise norm given by our riemannian metric @xmath51 on @xmath16 and @xmath147 is a function whose graph is as in figure [ figure ] , with the heights of its minima and maxima given by the coordinates @xmath148 of @xmath143 .",
    "( more detail on the functions @xmath149 is given at the start of section [ compute ] ; our argument requires them to take a rather special form , though this constraint is likely only technical . )",
    "recall that the function @xmath150 on @xmath58 has hamiltonian flow given by the geodesic flow of @xmath51 ; consequently @xmath145 will restrict to each cosphere bundle @xmath114 as the time - one map of a reparametrization of the geodesic flow .",
    "a point @xmath151 will lie in @xmath152 if and only if @xmath153 , @xmath154 vanishes on @xmath155 , and @xmath156 is the initial momentum of a geodesic of length @xmath157 which begins at @xmath158 and ends at @xmath22 .",
    "[ figure ] . in this case",
    "@xmath159 , with the coordinates of @xmath143 equal to the heights of the extrema of @xmath149 as one moves from right to left.,title=\"fig:\",width=312 ]    thus a geodesic @xmath160 in @xmath16 which starts orthogonally to @xmath21 and ends at @xmath22 gives rise to several generators for the floer complex @xmath161 , one for each value of @xmath115 such that @xmath162 is equal to the length of @xmath160 .",
    "in order for two generators of the complex to be intertwined by the floer boundary operator , their corresponding geodesics must be homotopic ( through paths from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) , and their floer - theoretic gradings must differ by @xmath140 .",
    "we compute the floer - theoretic grading in proposition [ gradecompq ] ; this grading is found to depend in an explicit way on the morse index of the geodesic @xmath160 and on the signs of both @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "meanwhile the action of the generator is approximately @xmath165 .",
    "provided that @xmath166 is sufficiently large , there will be a generator @xmath167 of @xmath161 whose associated geodesic from @xmath21 to @xmath22 has index zero and whose associated value of @xmath115 obeys @xmath168 , such that the action of @xmath167 is approximately @xmath169 . under assumption [ assm ] ( as applies in theorem [ mainlag ] ) , this generator will be a cycle in the floer complex .",
    "so since the floer homology vanishes , @xmath167 must also be a boundary .",
    "but assumption [ assm ] also implies that the only generators with grading @xmath140 larger than that of @xmath167 have the property that their associated value of @xmath115 obeys @xmath170 , with @xmath171 bounded above independently of @xmath143 .",
    "the special form of our functions @xmath149 then implies that @xmath165 is bounded below independently of @xmath143 .",
    "thus all possible primitives of @xmath167 have action bounded below by a constant , whereas @xmath167 has action approximately @xmath172 .",
    "this leads to an estimate @xmath173 .",
    "a similar argument , together with a duality property satisfied by the boundary depth , implies that @xmath174 . combining these two estimates",
    "quickly implies ( [ lagest ] ) .",
    "another duality argument yields the similar estimate ( [ lagest2 ] ) and hence completes the proof of theorem [ mainlag ] .",
    "we remark that for many cases of theorem [ mainlag ] it would suffice to study floer complexes of the form @xmath175 ( _ i.e. _ , to set @xmath21 equal to a single point ) . however , when @xmath176 one finds from the grading formula in proposition [ gradecompq ] that the argument indicated in the previous paragraph breaks down , and so in particular one can not set @xmath21 equal to a singleton in the case that @xmath16 is two - dimensional .",
    "so when @xmath16 is a surface of nonpositive curvature we instead set @xmath21 equal to a closed geodesic on @xmath16 that does not contain @xmath22 . of course , incorporating positive - dimensional @xmath21 into our discussion also allows us to obtain the more general results on the hofer geometry of @xmath83 mentioned in ( [ lagest2 ] ) ; furthermore , allowing positive - dimensional @xmath21 in the hypothesis of theorem [ mainham ] leads to the hypothesis being preserved under products with arbitrary compact manifolds , as noted in remark [ product ] .      in the following section [ gens ] we set up the general framework for the floer complex associated to a hamiltonian function and a pair of suitable noncompact lagrangian submanifolds of a liouville manifold , and we define the boundary depth associated to this complex and",
    "prove the basic result corollary [ lip ] connecting the boundary depth to hofer geometry .",
    "section [ geodesic ] specializes the discussion to the case in which the liouville manifold is the cotangent bundle @xmath58 of a riemannian manifold , the hamiltonian is a function of the norm given by the riemannian metric , and the pair of the lagrangian submanifolds consists of a conormal bundle @xmath81 and a cotangent fiber @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the floer complex can be understood in terms of geodesics from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . for our main results",
    "it is important to work out the grading on the complex , as we do in detail in section [ grading ] ; this is somewhat easier when @xmath21 consists of a single point ( which as mentioned earlier suffices for many cases of theorem [ mainlag ] ) , so we treat that case initially , followed by a discussion of the necessary modifications in the more general case .",
    "next , in section [ assumption ] , we introduce assumption [ assm ] on the behavior of geodesics connecting @xmath21 to @xmath22 and discuss some situations in which it holds . this assumption is a somewhat more general version of the hypotheses of theorems [ mainham ] and [ mainlag ] , and is the most general context in which we are able to prove such results .",
    "finally , in section [ compute ] , we introduce a special class of hamiltonians for which the grading computation of section [ grading ] allows us to get strong lower bounds on the boundary depth under assumption [ assm ] , and we prove these lower bounds . from these lower bounds",
    "we deduce corollary [ maincor ] , which has theorem [ mainlag ] as a special case , thus completing the proofs of our main results .",
    "i am grateful to leonid polterovich for asking me the question which motivated this work and for various helpful comments .",
    "the work was supported by nsf grant dms-1105700 .",

    "so since @xmath953 ( so @xmath164 , which was earlier shown to be negative , has opposite sign to @xmath958 ) , we have @xmath959 .",

    "this fact leads to an estimate @xmath973 , and hence to @xmath974 details are left to the reader .",
    "let @xmath982 denote the minimal length of an index-@xmath53 geodesic from @xmath21 to @xmath22 in class @xmath41 ( such exists by assumption [ assm](i ) ) .",
    "let @xmath983 ( note that it follows from the construction of @xmath680 that @xmath984 attains its minimal value , which is negative , at @xmath985 ) .",
    "thus if @xmath986 , then there is @xmath987 such that @xmath988 .    if @xmath989 , choose @xmath950 so that @xmath990 . for each @xmath991",
    "$ ] we have @xmath992 .",
    "so since @xmath993 there is @xmath994 such that @xmath995 and @xmath996 . since @xmath953 and , by the construction of @xmath680 , @xmath955 is negative on @xmath997 , we have @xmath998 .",
    "since @xmath996 is the length of a morse index-@xmath53 geodesic from @xmath499 to @xmath22 in the class @xmath41 , there is a corresponding element @xmath999 .",
    "since @xmath1000 and @xmath1001 are both positive we have @xmath1002 by proposition [ gradecompq ] . as for the action , let @xmath1003 , so that @xmath1004 and so @xmath1005 , @xmath1006 and @xmath1007 is positive on @xmath1008 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath1009 this proves ( i )    the proof of ( ii ) is essentially the same : choose @xmath950 so that @xmath1010 , and then there is @xmath994 with @xmath995 such that @xmath1011 .",
    "moreover there is a corresponding @xmath999 , which will have @xmath1012 since @xmath1013 , and will have @xmath1014 by a similar calculation to that above .        by construction ,",
    "each of the functions @xmath1017 have only finitely many critical values . from this ( and the fact that @xmath22 is not a focal point of @xmath21 , so that there are only countably many geodesics from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) it is easy to see that , for any @xmath1018 , all but countably many @xmath325 have the property that the transversality condition ( [ transcond ] ) holds for the function @xmath1019 .",
    "so using the continuity property ( [ betacont ] ) of the boundary depth it suffices to prove the proposition for those @xmath37 such that @xmath924 ( so that in particular the floer complex @xmath1020 is well - defined ) .",
    "let @xmath94 be the maximum of the constant @xmath1021 from proposition [ k - c ] and the constant @xmath1022 from proposition [ deep ] .",
    "then ( [ keyest ] ) is trivial if @xmath1023 ( since @xmath1015 is by definition always nonnegative ) , so we may assume that @xmath1024 .    now either @xmath1025 or @xmath1026 . in the first case , we have @xmath1027 , so by proposition [ deep](i ) there is a generator @xmath604 for @xmath1028 with filtration level at most @xmath1029 .",
    "but by proposition [ k - c](i ) , there are no generators of @xmath1030 having action less than or equal to @xmath1031 .",
    "this implies first that @xmath1032 ( where @xmath418 is the floer differential ) , since @xmath418 maps @xmath1033 to @xmath1034 and lowers filtration level , and the filtration level of @xmath604 is at most @xmath1035 .",
    "but the homology of the chain complex @xmath1036 is zero ( it is independent of the choice of compactly supported hamiltonian @xmath133 , and clearly vanishes when @xmath1037 since @xmath132 ) . so the fact that @xmath1032 implies that @xmath1038    by another application of proposition [ k - c](i ) , all nonzero elements of @xmath1039 have filtration level at least @xmath1031 .",
    "thus @xmath604 is an element of the image of the boundary operator having filtration level at most @xmath1029 , all of whose primitives have filtration level at least @xmath1031 .",
    "this proves ( [ keyest ] ) in the case that @xmath1025 .",
    "there remains the case that @xmath1026 .",

    "opposite complex , the generator @xmath604 provided by proposition [ deep](ii ) will have grading @xmath1042 and filtration level at most @xmath1043 , while proposition [ k - c](ii ) shows that @xmath604 is a cycle ( and hence a boundary ) in the opposite complex ( since all index-@xmath1044 generators have higher filtration level ) , and that all primitives of @xmath604 have filtration level at least @xmath1031 . thus in the case that @xmath1026 we again obtain ( [ keyest ] ) .",
    "[ maincor ] let the riemannian manifold @xmath18 , the submanifold @xmath21 , and the point @xmath20 which is not a focal point of @xmath21 obey assumption [ assm ] .",

    "then the homomorphism @xmath86 defined by @xmath1046 satisfies the following properties , for all @xmath49 :      it is immediate from the definition of @xmath149 that @xmath1051 ; thus @xmath1052 is indeed a homomorphism and the formula ( [ hflow ] ) for the hamiltonian flows of the functions @xmath526 directly implies ( i ) . as for ( ii ) , note that for any lagrangian submanifold @xmath139 , the @xmath79-invariance of the hofer distance @xmath63 , together with ( i ) , shows that we have @xmath1053    now @xmath1054 since the floer complex @xmath1055 vanishes . hence by corollaries [ lip ] and [ best ] , @xmath1056 proving the first line of ( ii ) . as for the second line of ( ii ) , note that for all @xmath143 the floer complex @xmath1057 is naturally isomorphic ( modulo a shift of grading that results from our normalization convention ) as a filtered chain complex to the opposite complex of @xmath1058 ( in the sense of @xcite and of the last paragraph of proposition [ best ] ) .",
