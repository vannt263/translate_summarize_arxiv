    "for more than a decade there has been intensive research of spin polarized transport@xcite with a view to exploit phenomena such as the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) of ferromagnetic junctions@xcite and the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in multilayer structures.@xcite the tmr effect arises because the mismatch of spin currents at the interface between two ferromagnetic ( f ) electrodes with antiparallel spin polarizations produces a larger contact resistance than a junction with parallel polarizations . in general , the magnitude of tmr increases with the degree of polarization of the ferromagnets , but it is reduced by spin relaxation phenomena@xcite , such as spin - orbit scattering at impurities or magnon emission , which lift spin current mismatch .",
    "magnon emission is an inelastic process that has been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in ferromagnetic tunnel junctions with a view to relate nonlinear @xmath10 characteristics to the density of states of magnons @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "as well as influencing the magnetoresistance , magnon emission is expected to produce a magnetothermopower effect : a larger thermopower in the antiparallel orientation than in the parallel one.@xcite    meanwhile , interest in transport across junctions between ferromagnets and normal metals or semiconductors has focused on the possibility of injecting spin into the normal system.@xcite current in the ferromagnet ( f ) is carried unequally by majority and minority carriers so that a current flowing across the interface with a normal conductor is expected to have a finite degree of spin polarization @xmath13 , @xmath1 .",
    "spin injection from a ferromagnetic metal into a normal metal ( n ) has been measured in broad agreement with theory,@xcite but there has been difficulty in achieving large degrees of spin injection into a semiconductor at room temperature.@xcite a limiting factor is believed to be conductivity mismatch,@xcite a problem that may be overcome by introducing a tunneling barrier between the ferromagnet and semiconductor.@xcite spin injection in all - semiconducting devices has generally been more successful,@xcite although it is limited to relatively low temperatures at the moment .    in this paper we investigate the opposite effect : the injection of charge caused by the equilibration of magnetization between ferromagnetic baths kept at different temperatures .",
    "the magnetization of a ferromagnet held at a finite temperature @xmath7 is less that its maximum value due to the thermal occupation of magnons , with the fractional change @xmath14 obeying bloch s @xmath8 law , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spin of the localized moments and @xmath17 is the magnon debye energy . under certain conditions",
    "the transfer of heat across a junction between ferromagnets or a ferromagnet and a normal metal may involve simultaneous spin transfer and , possibly , charge transfer .",
    "therefore we study the influence of magnon assisted processes on the transport properties of a mesoscopic size ferromagnet / insulator / normal metal tunnel junction .",
    "the bottle - neck of both charge and heat transport lies in a small - area tunnel contact between the electrodes held at different temperatures and/or electric potentials .",
    "the main result is a large thermopower @xmath18 arising from the magnon - assisted processes that depends on the difference between the size of the majority and minority band fermi surfaces in the ferromagnet , @xmath19 this result holds in a range of temperatures given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi energy .",
    "the function @xmath13 , @xmath1 , is the degree of spin polarization of the current response to a bias voltage and it depends , in general , on the area of the maximal cross - section of the fermi surface in the plane parallel to the interface of majority @xmath2 and minority @xmath3 electrons in the ferromagnet , and of the electrons in the normal ( non - magnetic ) metal @xmath4 . as an example , @xmath22 for a momentum - conserving tunneling model with @xmath23 .    the magnon - assisted processes that we consider are similar to those discussed in refs .   in relation to transport in f - f tunnel junctions .",

    "<S> we develop a theoretical model of magnon - assisted transport in a mesoscopic tunnel junction between a ferromagnetic metal and a normal ( non - magnetic ) metal . the current response to a bias voltage </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by the contribution of elastic processes rather than magnon - assisted processes and the degree of spin polarization of the current , parameterized by a function @xmath0 , @xmath1 , depends on the relative sizes of the majority @xmath2 and minority @xmath3 band fermi surface in the ferromagnet and of the fermi surface of the normal metal @xmath4 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , magnon - assisted tunneling gives the dominant contribution to the current response to a temperature difference across the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting thermopower is large , @xmath5 , where the temperature dependent factor @xmath6 reflects the fractional change in the net magnetization of the ferromagnet due to thermal magnons at temperature @xmath7 ( bloch s @xmath8 law ) and @xmath9 is the magnon debye energy .    2 </S>"
