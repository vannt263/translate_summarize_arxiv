    "the transport of flexible biological or man made fibers by a flow and their deformation is of interest in view of their potential applications in many different industrial fields .",
    "a first example is the paper industry in which the orientation and spatial distributions of the fibers in the flowing pulp must be controlled  @xcite .",
    "fibers are also widely used by petroleum engineers  @xcite to enhance the proppant transport capabilities of fracturing fluids , or to prevent the backflow of proppant .",
    "other domains of application are civil engineering ( special cements , structural reinforcement ) , textile engineering , bio engineering and medicine .    in flows at low reynolds numbers , the deformation of fibers reflects a balance between viscous and elastic stresses and plays often an important part : for instance , these effects are critical for understanding the dynamics of flexible biological filaments  @xcite , the filtration and cross stream migration of macromolecules in small channels @xcite and the positioning of bio - fibers in porous media  @xcite . in all these applications , the prediction of the motion of the fibers is a difficult fundamental problem , particularly in complex geometries and inhomogeneous flows where constrictions and obstacles are present : these create complex interactions between the flexible objects , the flowing fluids and the solid walls .",
    "our interest in these problems is focused on the injectability and transport of long flexible fibers through fractures in reservoir rocks . in a previous work",
    "@xcite , we studied fiber transport by a flow in single narrow model rough fractures and of its dependence on the fluid velocity , the flexibility of the fiber and the configuration of the aperture field .",
    "the present work is devoted to a quantitative study of the influence of the parameters in the configuration where the fiber passes in the vicinity of contact areas or close to regions of low aperture .",
    "this situation is modeled experimentally by means of a hele - shaw cell of constant aperture and of width varying with the distance : this allows one to determine the variations along the flow of the orientation and deformation of the flow lines and of a fiber placed in the flow .",
    "more specifically , we seek to relate the variations of the curvature of the fiber to those of the streamlines , to the velocity gradients and to the geometrical and mechanical properties of the fiber .",
    "most past studies considered the simpler case of flexible fibers in a non confined parallel shear flow  @xcite of shear rate @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the modulus of the local flow velocity and the derivative is taken is the direction perpendicular to the flow lines ) . in such a configuration , the fiber may rotate about its axis and buckles above a threshold value of the sperm number which characterizes the relative magnitudes of the viscous and elastic forces . and",
    "is equal to : @xmath5 @xmath6 is the viscosity , @xmath3 is the shear rate along the fiber , @xmath7 its young s modulus , @xmath8 its area moment of inertia ( @xmath9 for a circular cross section of diameter @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 a characteristic dimension ( for instance the length @xmath12 of the fiber ) .",
    "other studies dealt with the cross stream migration of a flexible fiber in a parallel poiseuille flow which is also strongly influenced by buckling  @xcite .",
    "finally , buckling is also observed above a critical value @xmath13",
    "@xcite ) of @xmath0 for fibers approaching a stagnation point  @xcite .",
    "numerically , slender - body theory has been used to model the behavior of an elastic fiber ( with one clamped end ) in the vicinity of a corner in a curved channel  @xcite . in this latter work , the variation with time and the final shape of the filament were analyzed in different corner geometries as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "recently , wexler et al .",
    "@xcite considered a fiber with one clamped end and initially transverse to a flow confined between two plates ( like in the present case ) . in all cases , bending results from the combined effects of the hydrodynamic and viscous forces on the fibers : yet , in refs .",
    ", their resultant is balanced by a force on the attachment point while , in the present case of a free fiber , this resultant must be zero , leading to very different shapes of the fibers .    in the following ,",
    "we characterize first the flow field in the hele - shaw cell of varying width by means of dye tracer measurements and of @xmath14 numerical simulations : we study in particular the variations of the velocity along the streamlines .",
    "then , the local velocity and mean orientation of the fibers are compared to those of the fluid velocity at the same location .",
    "the curvature @xmath15 of the fibers is characterized by its ratio @xmath16 to that of the streamlines : the variations of the extremal values of this ratio on different streamlines are studied as a function of the diameter @xmath10 and length @xmath12 of the fiber , of its initial transverse location and of the flow velocity . the definition of the sperm number @xmath0 of the problem allowing one to take into account the influence of these different parameters is then discussed and the experimental dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath17 is analyzed .",
    "the experimental setup consists of a hele shaw cell placed vertically .",
    "its height and gap are respectively @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] ) .",
    "the upper part of the cell has a y - shaped section ; the top is attached to a fluid bath with a slit at the bottom allowing for the flow of the fluid and the injection of the fibers .",
    "the fiber is injected in a funnel - shaped device which permits to select conveniently the location at which the fiber is injected .",
    "a rounded off step is then cut out of a transparent mylar sheet of thickness equal to @xmath20 and inserted in the hele shaw cell .",
    "the mylar is tightly fitted so that no flow is observable between its surface and the walls of the cell . the height @xmath21 of the step parallel to the @xmath22 axis is @xmath23 and it is located in the middle of the cell ; the width @xmath24 of the flow section in the cell is then @xmath25 in the inlet section and is reduced to @xmath26 at the outlet as shown in the figure .",
    "the axis @xmath27 corresponds to the boundary of the mylar sheet at the inlet .        using a continuous rather than an abrupt variation of the height of the step boundary with the distance",
    "first minimizes unwanted solid - solid interactions between the fiber and this boundary .",
    "moreover , a continuous variation of the width of the flow channel with distance is closer to the variation encountered in a real fractured rock . finally , putting uniform flow sections before and after the step allows one to detect possible irreversible rotations and deformations of the fiber .",
    "a gear pump produces a downward flow ; two newtonian fluids are used : pure ( miliq ) water , of density @xmath28 and a viscosity @xmath29 , and a solution of @xmath30 glycerol by weight in water , of density @xmath31 and viscosity @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the flow rate @xmath34 is in the range @xmath35 , which corresponds to a characteristic velocity @xmath36 ; in this work , @xmath37 is the maximum of the poiseuille velocity profile ( half way between the walls ) in the inlet parallel flow section upstream of the step .",
    "downstream of the step , the velocity is higher by a factor @xmath38 .",
    "for the water - glycerol solution , the corresponding reynolds number @xmath39 is in the range @xmath40 . for water",
    ", one has respectively @xmath41 .",
    "the flexible silicone fibers are made using a technique developed in the laboratory .",
    "silicone is forced out of a syringe at an adjustable flow rate by means of a syringe pump .",
    "a second pump with a plate attached to the top is placed below the end of the first one so that the plate moves perpendicular to the flow .",
    "the injection leaves on the top of the plate thin flexible silicone fibers of constant diameter .",
    "the respective values of the speeds of the silicone at the outlet of the syringe pump and of the moving plate are very important . in order to obtain fibers of constant diameter",
    ", the velocity of the outflow must match approximately that of the plate . if the speeds are not well matched , either the stream of silicone buckles or it breaks  @xcite .",
    "fibers of different diameters can be made by using nozzles of different sizes : in the present work , nozzles of diameter @xmath42 were used .",
    "the average @xmath10 of the diameter over its orientation in the section and the fiber length is constant within @xmath43 from a fiber to another ; the diameter is constant along the length for a given orientation within @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath45 ) . in a given section ,",
    "the variation of the diameter with its orientation is of the order of @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath45 .",
    "large fibers become indeed elliptical because they sag under gravity before they polymerize : this effect is prevented by surface tension for @xmath50 .",
    "the lengths of the fibers are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 and , although they are lighter than water ( @xmath54 ) , the tests showed that gravity has little effect on the experimental results . in order to evaluate the stability of their properties ,",
    "the silicone fibers were left overnight in different fluids ( water , and water glycerol solutions ) : no swelling occurred .    in the interpretation of the present experiments , the bending stiffness @xmath55 of the fiber plays a major role . in order to measure @xmath55 ,",
    "the fiber is allowed to bend under its own weight with one of its ends clamped in a chuck - like device which keeps it locally horizontal ; the fiber is placed in front of a dark background in order to achieve a high optical contrast .",

    "<S> the ratios of the curvatures of the fibers by the corresponding curvatures of the streamlines reflect a balance between elastic and viscous forces : this ratio is shown experimentally to be determined by a dimensionless _ sperm number _ @xmath0 combining the characteristic parameters of the flow ( transverse velocity gradient , viscosity , fiber diameter / cell gap ratio ) and those of the fiber ( diameter , effective length , young s modulus ) . for short fibers , </S>",
    "<S> the effective length is that of the fiber ; for long ones , it is equal to the transverse characteristic length of the flow . for @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the curvatures increases linearly with @xmath0 ; for @xmath2 , the fiber reaches the same curvature as the streamlines . </S>"
