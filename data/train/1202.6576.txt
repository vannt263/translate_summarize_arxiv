    "among the multitude of noise sources limiting the sensitivity of contemporary laser gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors ( ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo-600 @xcite , and tama @xcite ) , the one , usually referred to as _ quantum _ noise and stemming from the quantum nature of light , stands apart from the rest of the noise sources , referred to as _ technical _ or _ classical _ ones , respectively .",
    "quantum noise originates from quantum fluctuations of phase ( shot noise ) and intensity ( radiation - pressure noise ) of light circulating inside the interferometers , which obey heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite and therefore can not be reduced simultaneously .",
    "the latter group comprises various fluctuations of thermal , seismic and similar origin that can be , in principle , diminished either by cooling , or using better materials , more sophisticated seismic isolation and so on .",
    "all the hitherto undertaken efforts towards the improvement of gw interferometers sensitivity went in two parallel but virtually independent streams . in many proposed methods of diverse technical noise sources mitigation @xcite ,",
    "the authors assumed quantum noise of the interferometer as independent of the technical noise budget and thus did not take it into consideration .",
    "equally lukewarm were the researchers of the quantum noise , who proposed a plenty of sophisticated and witty ways for its reduction @xcite , towards the technical noise sources , tacitly implying them being independent on the quantum fluctuations of light inside the interferometer .",
    "however , the growing interest to the optimal configurations of future gw detectors , inspired by the recent achievements in reduction of technical noise in first - generation detectors and a proximity of the start of construction of the second generation ones , has brought the problem of simultaneous treatment of the two groups of noise sources to the fore @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity of the current first generation detectors ( the most sensitive of them , ligo , has already finished its life cycle ) is limited mostly by seismic noise at lower frequencies ( below @xmath0 ) and by the quantum shot noise at higher frequencies . in the next - generation detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , and lcgt @xcite ,",
    "the technical noise will be reduced significantly by using much better seismic isolation and other technological advances . along with this , the quantum shot noise will be suppressed by about one order of magnitude due to increased optical power and , very probably , by the injection of the quantum squeezed light into the interferometer , as it has been proposed first in @xcite ( this technology has been successfully tested experimentally in geo-600 @xcite ) . yet",
    "the second generation detectors sensitivity remain bound by the mix of the technical and quantum noise : shot noise at high frequencies , ( ii ) radiation - pressure noise at low frequencies , and ( iii ) coatings thermal noise in the best sensitivity medium frequencies band around @xmath1 ( see fig.3 of the paper @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we make a further step forward and consider quantum noise and coating thermal noise in conjunction .",
    "the importance of thermal fluctuations in core optics dielectric coatings was realised by the community several years ago @xcite .",
    "all the hitherto proposed ways to reduce these fluctuations , were it based on broadening of laser beams @xcite , or on using better coating materials @xcite , or on coating structure optimisation @xcite , followed implicitly a common rule that the end mirrors ( etms ) of the interferometer should be as reflective as possible thus requiring the number of coating layers to be pretty large ( ca .",
    "but since the power spectral density of these fluctuation rises linearly with the number of coating layers , the improvement provided by these methods is rather modest .    another apparent way to get rid of coating noise by getting rid of the ( at least a part of )",
    "the coating itself was proposed even earlier . in @xcite",
    ", authors suggested to replace the end mirrors by coatingless corner reflectors , while in @xcite the short anti - resonance - tuned fabry - prot cavities have to play the role of etms .",
    "even more radical solution to use the pass - through mach - zehnder / fabry - prot topology instead of the michelson / fabry - prot one was suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of these methods in the near future is improbable , for corner reflectors were shown to have high optical losses @xcite and the latter two solutions require too radical modifications of the gw detector optical setup .",
    "the requirement for the etms of the standard michelson / fabry - prot scheme of gw interferometer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : detector ] ) to have high reflectivity has rather strong logic behind .",
    "there are two obvious reasons in favour of it .",
    "first , in the power - recycled topology , the value of etm power reflectivity @xmath2 defines how much circulating power @xmath3 can be built up in the arm cavities , for a given value of the input laser power @xmath4 : @xmath5 simple estimate based on the values of @xmath4 and and @xmath3 planned for the advanced ligo yields @xmath6 .",
    "second , a non - ideal reflectivity of the end mirrors means an injection of additional optical vacuum fluctuations into the arm cavities , that is , the increase of the quantum noise .",
    "but if we ask ourselves a question whether this requirement always provides unconditionally optimal sensitivity for the gw interferometer , we claim that the answer will be ` no ' .",
    "the circulating power issue can be solved either by using more powerful laser , as _",
    "e.g. _ the one with @xmath7  w proposed for the third generation einstein telescope gravitation - wave detector @xcite , or by using squeezed vacuum injection as it might be done in advanced ligo @xcite .    regarding the influence of the additional vacuum entering the arm cavities through the more transparent etms , it is evident , that in the scenario where the total noise budget , in the best sensitivity frequency band , is dominated by the mirrors coatings thermal noise , it is reasonable to reduce the number of coating layers of the end mirrors , increasing the quantum noise , but decreasing the coatings thermal noise .",
    "therefore , the number of layers of the core optics coatings should be included into the set of optical parameters , such as arm cavities bandwidth , the signal recycling mirror transmittance and the the signal recycling cavity detuning , over which the minimisation of the sum noise of the interferometer is run .    in this paper",
    ", we perform this kind of optimisation for the signal- and power - recycled fabry - prot  michelson interferometer ( see fig.[fig : detector ] ) , assuming its main parameters close to the ones planned for the advanced ligo . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the variants of the advanced gravitation - wave detectors scheme which we optimise , the model of technical noise and quantum noise which we use , and the optimisation procedure . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] , we discuss the results of optimisation .",
    "* plain : the ordinary signal- and power - recycled interferometer , similar to the advanced ligo , with vacuum input ( no squeezing ) . * squeezed : the same as the above , but with squeezed light injection into the dark port . *",
    "pre - filtering : the same as previous , but with frequency - dependent squeezing angle implemented by means of the additional input filter cavity . * post - filtering : the back action evading configuration with the additional output filter cavity and the squeezed light injection into the dark port .",
    "the last two configurations , in a more sophisticated two - cavities form , were first proposed in paper @xcite .",
    "here we consider more simple cases with only one relatively short filter cavity .",
    "estimates ( see , _ e.g _ , @xcite ) show that in the presence of the technical noise , single filter cavity configurations provide almost the same sensitivity as the two - cavity ones , while being much less expensive in implementation .",
    "it was shown also in the paper @xcite that the sensitivity of these _ phase filtering _",
    "schemes is better than that of the _ amplitude filtering _",
    "configuration @xcite .",
    "currently , it is these two schemes that are considered as the most probable variants for upgrading the advanced ligo ."
