    "the casimir effect is an interesting phenomena that is due to the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields . the casimir effect of massless scalar field , electromagnetic field ( massless vector fields ) and massive scalar field have been extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , massive vector field has not been much considered , mostly due to its substantial complication compared to the massless case .",
    "nevertheless , massive vector field plays an important role in the study of physics with extra dimensions . to study a quantum field in a spacetime with extra dimensions",
    ", one can use the kaluza - klein decomposition to decompose the quantum field to an infinite tower of massive fields in four dimensions .",
    "this approach has been intrinsically used in a number of works to study the casimir effect of scalar field or spinor field in spacetime with extra dimensions such as kaluza - klein spacetime and randall - sundrum spacetime . for electromagnetic field , thanks to the work of barton and dombey @xcite , the casimir effect between two parallel perfectly conducting plates in kaluza - klein spacetime of the form @xmath0 and in randall - sundrum model have been computed respectively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect of a massive vector field was first considered in @xcite , and an explicit formula for the casimir energy has been derived for two perfectly conducting plates of finite thicknesses .",
    "asymptotic behaviors of the massive corrections were computed . unlike the electromagnetic field , a massive vector field has three polarizations .",
    "besides two transverse polarizations that correspond to the two polarizations of an electromagnetic field , a massive vector field also have longitudinal modes and these latter modes can penetrate through perfectly conducting objects .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , we generalized the work @xcite to magnetodielectric slabs .",
    "we found that for casimir effect of massive vector field on general magnetodielectric slabs , one can not separate the contribution from the transverse magnetic modes from the contribution of longitudinal modes , and we wound up with a very complicated formula for the casimir interaction energy .",
    "the tm contribution , which is a combination of the contributions from the transverse modes and the longitudinal modes , is expressed in terms of log determinant of a four by four matrix .",
    "it is almost impossible to study such a formula analytically .    to study the electromagnetic casimir effect of two semi - infinite dielectric slabs ,",
    "lifshitz @xcite has derived a formula which was later named after him .",
    "the first goal of this article is to derive a formula that looks more similar to the lifshitz formula for the casimir interaction between two semi - infinite magnetodielectric slabs due to the fluctuation of a massive vector field .",
    "the second objective is to consider the deviation from a perfect conductor . as in the works @xcite , we model the two semi - infinite slabs as real metals whose dielectric property is described by plasma model : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath3 is the effective plasma frequency . we expand the generalized lifshitz formula perturbatively in the dimensionless variable @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance between the slabs .",

    "<S> we first derive the generalization of the lifshitz formula that gives the casimir interaction energy of two magnetodielectric slabs separated by a magnetodielectric medium due to the vacuum fluctuations of a massive vector field . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the asymptotic behaviors of the casimir energy and the casimir force in various limits , such as low temperature , high temperature , small mass , large mass , up to the first order in the finite conductivity correction , for two real metal semispaces whose dielectric property is described by the plasma model . </S>",
    "<S> application to the casimir effect in randall - sundrum spacetime is briefly discussed . </S>"
