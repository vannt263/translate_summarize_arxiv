    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is an attractive multicarrier modulation technique for broadband wireless access systems due to its strong immunity to multipath fading and high spectral efficiency .",
    "however , ofdm signals suffer from high amplitude fluctuation which causes performance degradation due to nonlinear devices . a well - known metric for amplitude fluctuation of ofdm signal",
    "is peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) .",
    "many research efforts have been carried out to find efficient papr reduction techniques @xcite@xcite .",
    "also , the distribution of the papr of continuous ofdm signal was derived @xcite and it is widely accepted that four times oversampling is enough to capture the papr of continuous ofdm signals @xcite .",
    "another metric for amplitude fluctuation of ofdm signals has been considered @xcite@xcite , which is known as cubic metric ( cm ) @xcite .",
    "studies on papr and cm suggest that , except for large power backoff , cm is more closely related to the amount of distortion induced by a nonlinear power amplifier than papr @xcite . moreover , after analyzing certain ofdm - type signals that are considered to meet the goal of the long - term evolution ( lte ) , it was shown in the 3gpp that cm predicts amplifier power de - rating more accurately than papr @xcite .",
    "thus , recent research to reduce the cm for the lte systems has been carried out @xcite@xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the clipping and filtering method to reduce the cm instead of papr is proposed , where the descent clipper different to the conventional clipper is designed . in @xcite ,",
    "the tone reservation method is proposed , where minimizing the cm value is set to the objective function of convex optimization .    a great deal of the literature has been devoted to research on the properties of the papr metric as in @xcite@xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "such analysis on the cm has not been done before .",
    "thus , it is worth revealing more about the behavior of this metric . in this paper , an asymptotic probability distribution of cm for continuous ofdm signals",
    "is derived .",
    "also , sufficient oversampling rate for capturing the cm of continuous ofdm signals is obtained .",
    "the cm of ofdm signals is defined as @xcite @xmath0 where rcm is the raw cm defined by @xmath1\\big|_{{\\mathrm{db } } } \\triangleq 20\\log \\bigg[\\mathrm{rms}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{|s(t)|}{\\mathrm{rms}[s(t)]}\\bigg)^3\\bigg]\\bigg]\\ ] ] for a continuous ofdm signal @xmath2 and both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined according to the considered ofdm systems @xcite . as an example , in the downlink of lte , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are used .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : rcmdb ] ) , we are only interested in @xmath7 = \\sqrt{{\\mathbb{e}}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{|s(t)|}{\\sqrt{{p_{\\mathrm{av}}}}}\\bigg)^6\\bigg]}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the average power of the continuous ofdm signal @xmath2 . to simplify analysis",
    ", we will use the square of it as @xmath9)^2 = { \\mathbb{e}}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{|s(t)|}{\\sqrt{{p_{\\mathrm{av}}}}}\\bigg)^6\\bigg].\\ ] ]    in practice , instead of calculating the cm of continuous ofdm signals , we calculate the cm of discrete ofdm signals .",
    "let @xmath2 be a continuous ofdm signal and its @xmath10 times oversampled ofdm signal sequence be represented as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ofdm signal period , @xmath13 is the number of subcarriers , and @xmath10 is a real number larger than or equal to one .    without loss of generality",
    ", the input symbols in frequency domain are assumed to be statistically independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables with zero mean , where the input symbol is the complex data of each subcarrier .",
    "then the ofdm signal components in time domain are given by the sum of i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "thus , from the central limit theorem ( clt ) , the magnitude of @xmath14 is rayleigh distributed @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if it is normalized as @xmath15 @xmath16 the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given as @xmath19 finally , for the discrete ofdm signal sequence obtained by @xmath10 times oversampling , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are expressed as @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "in ( [ eq : xil ] ) , @xmath25 is sample mean of @xmath24 s and thus in this section we investigate the properties of the random variable @xmath24 . by the definition of weibull distribution , the power transformation @xmath26 of the rayleigh distributed random variable @xmath18 is known as weibull distribution @xcite .",
    "the pdf and cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath27 are given as @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the @xmath30th - order moment of @xmath27 is known as @xmath31 = \\gamma(1 + 3k)$ ] , where @xmath32 is the gamma function for an integer @xmath33 and @xmath34 $ ] denotes expectation value .",

    "this assumption guarantees the autocorrelation function of @xmath2 , @xmath51 $ ] , to be a real function . in any case , the frequency offset is immaterial to our analysis , because it does not change the magnitude of the envelope of ofdm signal . in this case , the normalized autocorrelation function @xmath52 is known as @xcite @xmath53 for @xmath54 and clearly @xmath55 for @xmath56 . note that @xmath57 when @xmath58 which implies the well known fact that the elements of the nyquist sampled ofdm signal sequence are mutually independent .",
    "the time lag between two discrete samples @xmath27 and @xmath39 is @xmath59 finally , the covariance of @xmath27 and @xmath39 is given as @xmath60",
    "in this section , we obtain the asymptotic distribution of @xmath61 by investigating the distribution of @xmath25 first .      the mean of @xmath25 is clearly 6 from ( [ eq : meanofw ] ) because @xmath25 is sample mean of @xmath27 . to find the variance of @xmath25 ,",
    "suppose that @xmath62 is an odd integer .",
    "even though @xmath62 can be any real number larger than or equal to @xmath13 , it is not difficult to show that discrepancy by the assumption is negligible . since @xmath14 is a complex stationary gaussian process , both @xmath18 and @xmath27 are also stationary random process . therefore , the variance of @xmath25 becomes @xmath63 we can separate the summation in ( [ eq : varofprocess ] ) into two parts and change the index of variable as @xmath64 using ( [ eq : variance ] ) and the fact that the covariance @xmath65 in ( [ eq : cov ] ) is symmetric and periodic with the period @xmath62 , ( [ eq : sigmal ] ) is rewritten as @xmath66 consider the following two extreme cases using ( [ eq : cov ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath67      we have @xmath68 unless @xmath13 is too small , it becomes approximately @xmath69 .",
    "the detailed derivation of the integration in ( [ eq : int ] ) is explained in appendix .        in this case , @xmath71 s are _ i.i.d . _ and thus @xmath72 is asymptotically gaussian distributed due to clt .",
    "that is , @xmath73 where _ a.s . _",
    "means that the random variable is asymptotically distributed .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case , @xmath25 is asymptotically gaussian distributed .",
    "we divide @xmath62 ofdm signal components @xmath14 into @xmath10 subsets @xmath74 in the interleaved pattern as @xmath75 since the components @xmath14 in the set @xmath76 are mutually independent , clt can be applied to each set",
    ". then we have @xmath10 asymptotically gaussian distributions that are correlated .",
    "the sum of correlated gaussian random variables is still gaussian .",
    "therefore , when @xmath10 is a natural number , we have @xmath77      clearly , the distribution of @xmath79 converges to some distribution as @xmath10 increases and we already checked that the distributions of @xmath25 for all natural number @xmath10 are asymptotically gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore , the distribution of @xmath79 is also gaussian such that @xmath80      under some assumptions , the above three cases can be integrated into one general result .",
    "the clt can be applied to @xmath81-dependent random process @xcite , where @xmath81-dependent means that two samples from a random process with the interval larger than @xmath81 have no statistical dependency .",
    "@xmath27 is an @xmath81-dependent random process from the fact that the correlation of the stationary random process @xmath27 may rapidly diminish as the interval exceeds @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for any real number @xmath10 larger than one , @xmath25 can be considered as gaussian distributed .      for the gaussian distributed @xmath25 with mean 6 and variance @xmath84 , complementary cdf ( ccdf ) of @xmath25",
    "is given as @xmath85.\\ ] ] thus , ccdf of @xmath83 is @xmath86\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the error function .    .",
    "[ fig : continuous ] compares the simulated and analytical ccdfs of @xmath88 .",
    "though we have obtained the distribution of @xmath83 for general value of @xmath10 , due to lack of space , we only present the comparison when @xmath89 , which is of importance practically . in the simulation , @xmath10",
    "is set to 32 , which is enough to represent the continuous ofdm signal , and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation is used .",
    "it is widely known that the metrics describing the envelope behavior of ofdm signals such as cm and papr do not depend on the modulation order .",
    "note that analysis is based on gaussian approximation in section [ sec : distribution ] .",
    "unfortunately , weibull distribution is a kind of heavy - tailed distribution and thus the sum of weibull random variables slowly converges to gaussian distribution as @xmath13 increases but it shows good agreement when @xmath13 is large as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : continuous ] .",
    "radically , the metrics such as papr and cm have to be calculated from continuous ofdm signals .",
    "however , it is impossible to handle with the continuous ofdm signal and instead one calculates the metrics from the oversampled discrete ofdm signal with sufficient oversampling rate . in this case",
    ", the metrics calculated from the oversampled ofdm signal can be viewed as an estimator for the metrics of the continuous ofdm signal .",
    "for instance , in the case of the cm calculation , @xmath61 is the estimator for true parameter @xmath90 .",
    "it is natural that a high sampling rate guarantees low estimation error but it also entails high complexity .",
    "thus , finding a sufficient sampling rate is of great importance .    in @xcite ,",
    "upper bounds on the estimation error of papr according to @xmath10 is derived and it is proposed that four times oversampling rate is enough to capture the papr of continuous ofdm signals . however , in the case of cm , this approach is not useful .",
    "differing from the papr , the estimator @xmath61 rarely shows extremely large estimation error .",
    "therefore , the total inspection approach is not suitable in the case of cm .",
    "this is due to the fact that the weibull distribution is a kind of heavy - tailed distribution which means that its variance is quite large .",
    "for instance , when the ofdm signal sequence is an impulse signal with @xmath91 , it has @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", the square error @xmath94 is much larger than the mean square error ( mse ) @xmath95",
    "\\simeq 5\\times 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "thus , in this section we statistically approach this problem by deriving the mse @xmath96 $ ] according to @xmath10 .      to obtain the mse @xmath96 = { \\mathbb{e}}[|\\sqrt{\\xi_l}-\\sqrt{\\xi_{\\infty}}|^2]$ ] , first we find the joint pdf of @xmath25 and @xmath79 which is clearly bivariate gaussian distribution from our investigation in section [ sec : distribution ] .",
    "we already checked their mean values @xmath97={\\mathbb{e}}[\\xi_{\\infty}]=6 $ ] .",
    "next , the correlation coefficient between @xmath25 and @xmath79 is given as @xmath98 where the equation in the integration is periodic with the period @xmath99 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath100 in terms of estimation theory , @xmath101 implies that @xmath25 can be considered as an unbiased minimum mse estimator of @xmath79 .",
    "that is , orthogonality principle @xmath102 = 0 $ ] and unbiased property @xmath97 = { \\mathbb{e}}[\\xi_{\\infty}]$ ] are satisfied .      using the orthogonality principle ,",

    "[ fig : mse_of_xi ] compares @xmath104 $ ] values obtained by simulation and analysis , which shows a good agreement .",
    "analytical results are given by using ( [ eq : msexil ] ) and simulation results are obtained by testing randomly generated @xmath105 ofdm signal sequences .",
    "the mse between @xmath61 and @xmath90 can be obtained as @xmath106 & = { \\mathbb{e}}[|\\sqrt{\\xi_l}-\\sqrt{\\xi_{\\infty}}|^2]\\\\ & = 12 - 2\\cdot{\\mathbb{e}}[\\sqrt{\\xi_l \\xi_{\\infty}}]\\\\ & \\overset{a.s.}{\\sim } 12 - 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\sqrt{\\xi_l \\xi_{\\infty}}\\ ; f_{\\xi_l,\\xi_{\\infty}}(\\xi_1,\\xi_2)~d\\xi_1\\;d\\xi_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the joint gaussian pdf of @xmath72 and @xmath108 with the correlation coefficient @xmath109 in ( [ eq : rhotau ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : mse_of_rcm ] compares @xmath110 $ ] values obtained by simulation and analysis using gaussian approximation . from a practical viewpoint ,",

    "thus , one can conclude that 1.7 times oversampling gives the normalized mse smaller than about @xmath111 for practical value of @xmath112 , which is remarkable because the fft size is typically 1.7 times larger than the nominal bandwidth for the lte cellular communication systems @xcite .",
