    "markov chains with a tridiagonal generator are common in biological applications , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "their asymptotic behaviour is well understood when the transitions probabilities are constant , i.e , the markov chain is homogeneous or , equivalently , autonomous in the language of dynamical systems . in this paper",
    "we consider the case where the transitions probabilities can vary in time , e.g. , periodically , or randomly due to a periodically or randomly changing environment .",
    "the markov chains are then nonautonomous or random dynamical systems @xcite and the concepts of autonomous dynamical systems such as equilibria are inadequate .",
    "thus a new concept of nonautonomous or random attractors is needed .",
    "the results in this paper are presented in the context of random markov chains and random dynamical systems , although the proofs are do not depend at all on probabilistic properties of the sample path parameter @xmath0 and are thus equally valid in the nonautonomous deterministic context of markov chains with , say , periodically varying transitions probabilities .",
    "tridiagonal markov chains , both deterministic and random , are presented in section  [ s - model ] . the long term dynamical behaviour of the autonomous deterministic case",
    "is then given for completeness in section  [ d - dynamics ] , although it follows as a special case , because it provides useful background information for the random case .",
    "the proof uses the fact that random markov chains generate contractive linear cocycles which map a positive cone into itself .",
    "first , in section  [ s - cometric ] , a general theorem on existence of a random attractor with singleton subsets in a metric space is formulated and proved .",
    "the assumptions seem rather restrictive at the first sight , but are just what is needed later .",
    "then , in section  [ s - hilbbirk ] some preliminaries from the theory of positive linear operators are recalled , the essence of which is that in a quite a general situation , for linear maps positive with respect to the same invariant cone , there exists a _",
    "common _ metric , the hilbert projective metric , in which all these linear mappings are _ uniformly contractive_. finally , in section  [ s - lincocycle ] , it is shown that the linear cocycles generated by the random markov chains in section  [ s - model ] satisfy the conditions of the abstract theorem from section  [ s - cometric ] under uniform upper and lower positivity bounds on the tridiagonal transitions probabilities and thus have a random attractor consisting of singleton subsets .",
    "the random attractor is essentially a randomly varying path in the simplex of probability vectors which pathwise attracts all other iterates of the markov chain . in the nonautonomous",
    "deterministic setting with periodical transitions probabilities it is a periodic path .",
    "there is an extensive literature on products of random markov chains , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "although the problem investigated here does not seem to have been addressed directly as such yet in the literature , the results could probably be obtained by extending the proofs in @xcite after similar computations to those that are needed below .",
    "the proof given here is preferable since it is direct and is written in the language of random dynamical systems . in particular , the paper demonstrates that the effect of a random attractor to be singleton is valid not only for some classes of monotone random systems , as it is reported earlier in @xcite , but also for the class of random markov chains studied below .",
    "markov chains with tridiagonal transition matrices are common in biological models , for example , birth - and - death processes @xcite , cell - cell communication @xcite and cancer dynamics @xcite , to name just a few .    to fix ideas , consider the distance @xmath1 between two cells at time @xmath2 , which is supposed to take discrete values in @xmath3 , essentially the distance that they can move in one unit of time , where @xmath1 can stay unchanged or change to @xmath4 with certain probabilities .",

    "<S> discrete - time discrete - state random markov chains with a tridiagonal generator are shown to have a random attractor consisting of singleton subsets , essentially a random path , in the simplex of probability vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the proof uses the hilbert projection metric and the fact that the linear cocycle generated by the markov chain is a uniformly contractive mapping of the positive cone into itself </S>",
    "<S> . the proof does not involve probabilistic properties of the sample path @xmath0 and is thus equally valid in the nonautonomous deterministic context of markov chains with , say , periodically varying transitions probabilities , in which case the attractor is a periodic path .    </S>",
