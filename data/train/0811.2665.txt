    "the metallic spinel liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has attracted much attention since a heavy fermion behaviour in this material was reported  @xcite . despite continuous activity in last years , there is currently no consensus on the mechanism for formation of heavy fermion quasiparticles in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , and the issue is still under debate  @xcite .    at low temperatures , @xmath7 k ,",
    "the spin system of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits pronounced short - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations  @xcite , but no long - range magnetic ordering was detected at any measured temperatures .",
    "the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice of vanadium ions ( in the mixed valence state v@xmath8 ) is likely to be a crucial aspect of the problem .",
    "the frustration may suppress at any @xmath3 a long - range ordering of strongly correlated itinerant electrons , but instead , the system is placed near to a magnetic instability .",
    "the emergence of largely degenerate low lying spin excitations in the ground state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is expected to be responsible for low-@xmath3 properties of this material , including its heavy fermion behaviour .",
    "this appealing picture has been developed in detail in previous work  @xcite .",
    "it can be examined by considering experimental results obtained by different techniques , like the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , probing low frequency spin fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath9li - nmr studies of the spin fluctuation dynamics in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 were reported in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "for high temperatures , @xmath10 k , the nmr relaxation data have been successfully explained  @xcite in terms of a v local moment formalism , while in the low - t region , @xmath7 k , an approach based on the itinerant and strongly correlated electrons in the paramagnetic metal liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is more appropriate .",
    "low-@xmath3 measurements down to @xmath111k on samples of high purity under ambient pressure reveal a nearly constant value of the knight shift @xmath12 and linear @xmath3 dependence of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath13 as for normal metals , but with a very high value of @xmath14 .",
    "an estimate  @xcite of the korringa relation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the electronic and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios respectively , and @xmath19 is less than unity , indicates  @xcite that presumably afm fluctuations are dominant in the spin - lattice relaxation at low @xmath3 .",
    "the nmr measurements on high purity samples of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 under pressure up to @xmath20 gpa were also reported by k. fujiwara _ et al _  @xcite . for @xmath21",
    "k , the value of @xmath14 which gives information on the @xmath22 averaged dynamical spin susceptibility becomes larger on applying higher pressure and grows with decreasing temperature .",
    "at the same time , the knight shift @xmath12 probing only the static unuform susceptibility @xmath23 was found to be nearly temperature independent and insensitive to the pressure above 2 gpa .",
    "these results were suggested  @xcite to be indicative of an increase under applying pressure of afm spin correlations at some momenta @xmath24 and their enhanced dominance over those at @xmath25 .",
    "if temperature is sufficiently low , the nmr properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 are strongly affected by a small amount of magnetic defects , @xmath26 mol @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the relaxation of the longitudinal nuclear magnetization versus time is no more a single exponential one but described by a stretched exponential function with the characteristic relaxation rate @xmath28 showing a peak at some temperature @xmath29k .",
    "such a behaviour was proved  @xcite to originate from the spin freezing of magnetic defects below @xmath30 . with decreasing @xmath31 , the peak position of @xmath28",
    "is apparently shifted to lower @xmath3 .",
    "remarkably , a proper model analysis of the low-@xmath3 nmr data obtained in powder samples of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 with varying @xmath32 mol @xmath27 has shown  @xcite that relaxation effects due to inhomogeneously distributed magnetic defects and homogeneous spin fluctuations inherent to magnetically pure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 are separable and thus can be examined independently .",
    "it is worth noting that in a single crystal of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 containing a small amount of magnetic impurities or crystal defects , a somewhat different behaviour was observed  @xcite , possibly because of a lack of the separability of the relaxation effects mentioned .",
    "a scenario explaining the considerable influence of a weak disorder on the low-@xmath33 spin dynamics detected by the low-@xmath3 nmr measurements on liv@xmath0o@xmath1 was proposed by johnston _",
    "@xcite , following a more general consideration developed in  @xcite . as already noted ,",
    "a critical aspect of the problem is the emergence in the ground state of pure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 of a large number of low lying spin excitations , implying a proximity of the system to a magnetic instability .",
    "inhomogeneously distributed magnetic defects may locally lift the degeneracy of low lying spin excitations and cause their partial condensation , thus giving rise to a strong change of spin dynamics at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "a large degeneracy of strongly enhanced and slow spin fluctuations in pure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 was confirmed by a combined analysis of the low temperture ins data  @xcite and the complementary calculations  @xcite of the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath34 . in these calculations",
    "performed first at @xmath35 , the actual electronic band structure of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 obtained in the local - density approximation is used and effects of strong electron correlations are treated in the random phase approximation . as an extension for finite @xmath3 ,",
    "the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory  @xcite of spin fluctuations was proved  @xcite to be a helpful tool in explaining the temperature renormalization of the low-@xmath33 spin fluctuation dynamics in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 derived from ins measurements  @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the parametrized scr theory is applied to elucidate the main features of the temperature and pressure dependences of the spin - lattice relaxation rate observed in the low-@xmath3 nmr measurements on liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "as known  @xcite , the scr theory offers a phenomenological description for spin fluctuations in nearly ferro- or antiferromagnetic itinerant electron systems by taking into account effects of mode - mode coupling between spin fluctuations either at @xmath36 or @xmath37 , respectively ; the latter case is applicable to the paramagnetic spinel liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . for details",
    "we refer to our recent work  @xcite , where the basic equation of the scr theory is solved numerically and the results are compared with ins data for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "there , the values of empirical parameters entering the scr theory are estimated to provide the best overall coincidence between the theory and ins experiment .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "an expression for the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath13 is derived in terms of the scr theory and , first , an evolution of @xmath14 down to @xmath5 k with increasing pressure is examined .",
    "next , since the temperature behaviour of @xmath14 down to much lower temperature @xmath38mk is available only at the highest applied pressure of 4.74 gpa , these particular data deserve a special attention .",
    "we argue , contrary to what k. fujiwara _ et al _ suggested  @xcite , that the upturn of @xmath14 detected below 0.6 k is not entirely due to homogeneous critical afm spin fluctuations , but more likely is a signature of an additional nuclear spin relaxation mechanism , probably due to the spin freezing of magnetic defects .",
    "summary and concluding remarks can be found in section 3 .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate due to electronic spin fluctuations is generally given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a @xmath22 dependent effective hyperfine coupling ; in our calculations , the resonance frequency @xmath41 will be taken in the limit @xmath42 . in ( [ a1 ] ) , the @xmath22 summation is over the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the fcc lattice inherent to the pyrochlore lattice of v atoms in the spinel structure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 ; @xmath43 is the dynamic spin susceptibility calculated per primitive cell ( four v atoms ) in units of @xmath44 .",
    "calculations suggest  @xcite a rather peculiar @xmath22-dependence of @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting model for a distribution in @xmath22 space of dominant spin fluctuations was checked  @xcite to provide a firm ground to describe the low-@xmath3 ins measurements for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "main features of the model are discussed and used below to calculate @xmath4 .    in the low-@xmath3 limit",
    ", the paramagnetic state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is characterized by strongly enhanced and slow spin fluctuations occupying a large region in @xmath22 space around the surface of a mean radius @xmath46 0.6 @xmath47 , called the critical surface  @xcite ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these strongly degenerate low-@xmath33 afm spin fluctuations dominate over those at smaller @xmath22 .",
    "such a rather peculiar distribution in @xmath22 space of the dominant afm spin fluctuations is a consequence of geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice of v atoms , which can be traced back  @xcite to the underlying electronic band structure and the many sheet fermi surface of the metallic spinel liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . with increasing @xmath3 ( up to 60 k ) ,",
    "the afm fluctuations get suppressed while those at the bz center remain nearly @xmath3 independent .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , the observed  @xcite warming shift of the low-@xmath33 integrated ins intensity ( from @xmath48 at @xmath49 toward low @xmath22 values at higher temperatures ) does not require any significant temperature renormalization of @xmath45 at small @xmath22 .      for the pure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "two main contributions to the spin - lattice relaxation rate can be written as @xmath50 as discussed later , at @xmath49 , the second contribution from afm spin fluctuations at @xmath51 is larger than the first one coming from the small @xmath22 spin fluctuations . for finite but low @xmath3 , because of a comparatively small variation with both temperature and pressure of the knight shift , and hence , of the intrinsic uniform susceptibility @xmath52 , one expects for the low-@xmath33 and small @xmath22 spin fluctuations much weaker temperature and pressure dependences than those observed  @xcite for afm spin fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in the subsequent analysis the contribution @xmath53 is assumed to be a constant and treated below as an adjustable parameter of the fit procedure . in this approximation , we relate the experimentally observed temperature and pressure dependence of @xmath6 merely to that of dominant afm fluctuations around the @xmath54 surface .",
    "let us choose a wave vector @xmath55 with the end point lying on the @xmath54 surface , and consider its vicinity , @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 ) , as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the inverse dynamic spin susceptibility can now be expanded as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are components of @xmath22 parallel and perpendicular to the normal @xmath61 to the @xmath54 surface . since the dynamic spin susceptibility is considered around @xmath36 , only the leading term of @xmath62 independent of @xmath22 is taken in the expansion ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to avoid an increase of the number of parameters in describing the dynamic spin susceptibility .",
    "space of the critical @xmath54 surface ( @xmath63 ) is shown schematically by the solid line .",
    "strongly enhanced antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations dominating low-@xmath3 properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 are located in a close vicinity ( of width @xmath64 ) to the @xmath54 surface .",
    "the meaning of decomposition @xmath65 for an arbitrary wave vector @xmath66 near the @xmath54 surface is explained in the text.,width=377,height=207 ]    in ( [ a3 ] ) , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath62 are empirical parameters that , together with @xmath69 , can be estimated  @xcite from ins and magnetic measurement data .",
    "the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath62 are usually taken to be @xmath3-independent in the low-@xmath3 region where the scr theory works well .",
    "strong anisotropy in @xmath22 space of afm spin fluctuations , i.e. @xmath71 , is assumed and verified  @xcite .",
    "it is also reasonable using a spherical approximation to the @xmath54 surface , implying that @xmath72 does not depend on the direction of @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath73 .    to be close to the standard notation of the scr theory  @xcite , we introduce , instead of @xmath67 and @xmath62 , the following parameters ( here , @xmath74 ):",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath76 is the effective radius of the bz boundary given in terms of the lattice primitive cell volume @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "next , the reduced inverse susceptibility at @xmath79 is defined as @xmath80    in this notation , one obtains for @xmath81 in the limit @xmath82 and up to a constant factor the following expression @xmath83 ^ 2}. \\label{a6}\\ ] ]    when performing the integration over @xmath22 in ( [ a1 ] ) , two dimensionless cutoff parameters , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are introduced . for the former ,",
    "the requirement @xmath86 is sufficient . as the latter cutoff we take @xmath87 , which distinguishes the region of the dominant afm spin fluctuations from that near the bz center . near the @xmath54 surface",
    ", the hyperfine coupling is assumed to be a constant @xmath88 .",
    "then the resulting expression for @xmath89 reads as @xmath90 including again the proper dimensional constants .      the reduced inverse susceptibility @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , obeys the following integral equation  @xcite : @xmath93/t\\right)-\\phi\\left(\\left[y_q\\left(t\\right ) + z^2 + bx_c \\right]/t\\right)}{bx_c /t } ,   \\label{a8}\\ ] ] with @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the gamma function .",
    "the present scr theory includes a set of five parameters which are now denoted as @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 characterize , at @xmath49 , the momentum and frequency spread of the dominant afm spin fluctuations , @xmath99 is the effective mode - mode coupling constant and @xmath101 describes a large anisotropy of the spin fluctuation dispersion ( [ a3 ] ) in @xmath22-space . from a fit to ins data , we obtained  @xcite the following estimates @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the parameter @xmath104^{-1}$ ] is a measure of distance from the magnetic instability .",
    "following earlier studies  @xcite , we consider @xmath96 to be the only pressure dependent parameter , assuming that @xmath105 as the system approaches a quantum critical point with increasing pressure . in case of ambient pressure ,",
    "both the empirical parameter @xmath103 and the solution of equation ( [ a8 ] ) are taken the same as in  @xcite , thus providing the agreement with ins data . here",
    ", two remaining fit parameters for @xmath6 under ambient pressure are found to be @xmath106 ( sec@xmath107k@xmath107 ) and @xmath108 kg . for nmr data obtained under the applied pressure , the only adjustable parameter @xmath96 is estimated by solving first the equation ( [ a8 ] ) and inserting the solution @xmath109 into ( [ a7 ] ) .",
    "the experimental data  @xcite for @xmath110 measured for different applied pressure together with theoretical curves fitting these data are depicted in figure 2 . a good agreement between the theoretical results and the available experimental data",
    "is found at least down to 1 k. first we note that away from the instability , i.e. , @xmath111 , the scr theory predicts the korringa behaviour ( @xmath112 constant ) in the low-@xmath3 limit . on applying higher pressure ( or , as @xmath113 ) ,",
    "@xmath6 becomes larger , while a temperature range near @xmath1140 , where the korringa relation holds , shrinks and tends to zero at @xmath113 .",
    "these results of the scr theory are in accordance with the temperature and pressure dependence of @xmath110 observed in liv@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ".     obtained from @xmath9li - nmr measurements on powder samples of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 under different applied pressure ; the data are taken from k. fujiwara _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "different curves together with corresponding values of the fit parameter @xmath96 represent the calculations based on the scr theory .",
    "+ , width=415,height=377 ]    the scr theory fails , however , in giving a quantitative description of the low-@xmath3 upturn of @xmath6 detected below 0.6 k under the highest applied pressure of 4.74 gpa .",
    "for instance , as seen from figure 2 , the parameter @xmath1150.018 fits well in describing the experiment down to @xmath5k , while for 0@xmath1160.018 a strong deviation in the whole temperature range is found ( see , for instance , the upper theoretical curve corresponding to @xmath1150.008 ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that just at the quantum critical point , @xmath96=0 , the equation ( [ a8 ] ) leads to the power law @xmath117 , in agreement with the earlier scr theory predictions  @xcite for the quantum critical behaviour of @xmath110 around the afm instability in three - dimensional metals .",
    "in contrast , the power law @xmath118 derived from the experimentally observed behaviour of @xmath110 in a wide temperature range , 0.1 k @xmath119 10 k , was reported in  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy can be clearly explained by taking into account that the scr theory is invoked to describe homogeneous spin fluctuations in a pure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , while a certain amount of crystal defects and/or magnetic impurities unavoidably present in the measured powder samples of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 may contribute to the nuclear spin relaxation as well .",
    "actually , when approaching a magnetic instability and softening of largely degenerate low lying spin fluctuations , the system becomes very susceptible to weak perturbations including , for instance , magnetic defects .",
    "as known  @xcite , the cooperative properties of the paramagnetic liv@xmath0o@xmath1 detected by nmr under ambient pressure can be drastically changed at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath120 k due to a small amount of magnetic defects .",
    "we suggest that the low-@xmath3 upturn of @xmath110 starting at @xmath121 0.6 k is more likely to be a manifestation of the onset of spin freezing of magnetic defects .",
    "if so , this calls for a complete reexamination of the experimental data below @xmath122 , as done , for instance , in  @xcite by using a stretched exponential description for the nuclear spin relaxation .",
    "we expect that measurement of @xmath110 on a sample with the same quality , but under the ambient pressure , would reveal the onset of spin freezing at a lower temperature , @xmath123 k , because of a larger distance from the instability .    finally , it is helpful to discuss the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath4 predicted by the scr theory for higher temperatures , @xmath124 .",
    "for instance , a typical behaviour @xmath125 is expected in the paramagnetic state of nearly and weakly afm three - dimensional metals  @xcite . by extending formally the present scr theory to the region @xmath124 , we obtain @xmath126 with @xmath127 , because of the scr equation ( [ a8 ] ) reflecting an effective quasi one - dimensionality due to the strong anisotropy in @xmath22 space of afm spin fluctuations in our model .",
    "we recall , however , that the present scr theory works well up to 40 k , which is below @xmath98 characteristic to liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , as evidenced from the comparison of theoretical results with ins data  @xcite .",
    "actually , for @xmath124 , the afm fluctuations at @xmath128 are suppressed and no more distinguished from those at other wave vectors in bz ; the system enters a spin localized regime compatible with the curie - weiss behavior of @xmath129 observed in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 for @xmath130 k.",
    "afm spin fluctuations located in a large region of @xmath22 space around the critical surface of a mean radius @xmath131 0.6 @xmath47 dominate the low-@xmath3 properties of the paramagnetic spinel liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "a parametrized self - consistent renormalization theory of the afm spin fluctuations was developed and applied to describe temperature and pressure dependences of the low-@xmath3 spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath4 in this material .",
    "most of the empirical parameters entering the present scr theory have been estimated earlier and kept fixed in the present study . to simulate pressure effects in our calculations , the inverse static spin susceptibility @xmath132 is considered to be the only fit parameter depending on the applied pressure .",
    "comparison between nmr data and the calculated results has shown that the scr theory is able to describe correctly the development of afm spin fluctuations as the paramagnetic metallic state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 approaches a magnetic instability under the applied pressure .",
    "in particular , we concluded that up to the highest applied pressure of 4.74 gpa , the spin system is still away from the instability . in this case , the scr theory predicts the korringa behaviour ( @xmath112 constant ) in a narrow temperature range near @xmath114 0 ; on applying higher pressure , a constant value @xmath6 becomes larger and a temperature range near @xmath114 0 , where the korringa relation holds , shrinks .",
    "the theoretical results were shown to be in a good agreement with experimental data for @xmath6 in wide ranges of temperature and pressure . a deviation from the theoretical prediction",
    "was interpreted as a signature of changing below the characteristic temperature @xmath122 ( @xmath133 1 k ) of the spin fluctuation dynamics . if for @xmath134 the nuclear spin relaxation is determined by homogeneous afm spin fluctuations inherent to a magnetically pure liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , then below @xmath122 cooperative properties of the detected paramagnetic state are strongly affected by coupling of spin fluctuations to magnetic defects in the measured sample of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "a detailed mechanism describing this coupling and the magnetic defect interactions in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 remains a challenge  @xcite for a further work .",
