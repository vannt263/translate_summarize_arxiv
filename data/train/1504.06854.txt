    "the motion of the spin expectation value ( the `` spin '' ) @xmath0 of a charged particle traveling in the electric and magnetic fields in a circular accelerator is described by the thomas - bmt equation  @xcite , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath3 is the location in the 6-dimensional ( 6d ) phase space and @xmath4 contains the electric and magnetic fields in the laboratory frame . for calculations it is convenient to write @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the contribution from motion on the closed orbit and @xmath7 is the contribution from the synchro - betatron motion .",
    "it is often necessary to describe spin motion with the help of a unit vector field @xmath8 ( the  invariant spin field  , or isf for short ) @xcite and this object will play a central rle in this paper .",
    "this satisfies the thomas - bmt equation along particle trajectories and is periodic with respect to @xmath2 : @xmath9 .",
    "the product @xmath10 is an invariant of motion , and the motion of @xmath0 is simply a precession around the local @xmath11-axis .",
    "the spin precession frequency around @xmath12 is characterized by the amplitude dependent spin tune @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the 6d orbital motion is integrable and away from orbital resonances and spin - orbit resonances ( defined below ) .",
    "then the static polarization limit  @xcite @xmath14 , with the inner average taken over orbital phases , is the maximum achievable equilibrium beam polarization on a phase - space torus . on the closed orbit , @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath15 and it is normally vertical in the arcs and @xmath13 reduces to the closed orbit spin tune @xmath16 . in a perfectly aligned planar ring , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 for protons , and @xmath19 is the relativistic factor for the design energy .",
    "the @xmath11-axis diverges from @xmath15 near the following spin - orbit resonances ( or `` spin resonances '' in short ) , and @xmath20 can be small , @xmath21 note that @xmath13 is usually undefined on orbital resonances , otherwise @xmath13 is only a function of the orbital actions @xmath22 and the optical state of the ring .",
    "in particular , if @xmath23 is an amplitude dependent spin tune , then the fractional part of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 is also an amplitude dependent spin tune . in other words",
    ", there is an equivalence class of amplitude dependent spin tunes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dip in @xmath20 across a spin resonance is accompanied by a jump in the amplitude dependent spin tune so that a system can never actually sit at a resonance as defined in eq .",
    "( 1 )  @xcite .",
    "the order of a resonance is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "normally @xmath13 stays close to @xmath16 .    in a planar ring ,",
    "the most important spin resonances are those due to vertical closed orbit distortions , which occur near @xmath28 , namely the imperfection spin resonances ; and those driven by the vertical betatron oscillations , which occur near @xmath29 , namely the first order intrinsic spin resonances with @xmath30 .",
    "the major challenge in a high energy polarized proton synchrotron like rhic is to preserve the beam polarization during acceleration  @xcite .",
    "the well - known frossart - stora formula  @xcite describes the polarization loss after crossing a single isolated spin resonance .",
    "introduction of a pair of diametrically opposed orthogonal siberian snakes  @xcite renders the closed orbit spin tune to be @xmath31 and independent of the beam energy .",
    "therefore intrinsic resonances are avoided for normal @xmath32 during acceleration and even with misalignments , @xmath16 remains close to @xmath33 independently of the energy so that imperfection resonances are avoided too .",
    "however , at rational vertical tunes satisfying the condition @xmath34 , there still can be strong loss of polarization during acceleration .",
    "this phenomeon is traditionally called `` snake resonance ''  @xcite although for rational @xmath32 the amplitude dependent spin tune does not exist so that this condition does not correspond to higher - order resonance as defined in eq .",
    "[ spin resonances ] .",
    "of course in a real ring with misalignments , @xmath16 need not be exactly 0.5",
    ". then pairs of real resonances in the sense of eq .",
    "[ spin resonances ] with irrational @xmath32 can appear , sitting symmetrically on each side of the @xmath32 for the `` snake resonance '' .",
    "these doublets can also cause loss of polarization during acceleration .",
    "inspired by the froissart - stora formula , in rings without snakes , it is common practice to compute the strengths of the imperfection and intrinsic resonances for a practical lattice , and identify the most dangerous ones .",
    "near one of these dangerous spin resonances , one can invoke the so - called `` single resonance model ''  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the rotating wave approximation whereby the effect of @xmath35 is dominated by one particular fourier harmonic at @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , and the corresponding resonance strength is @xmath38 .",
    "this lattice - independent model is analytically solvable , and can be extended to include siberian snakes , often modeled by `` point - like '' spin rotations .",
    "these lattice - independent models have been extensively studied for proton storage rings . analytical solutions for @xmath39 @xcite and the @xmath11-axis @xcite have been obtained , as well as @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "thus as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 is 0.5 independently of the betatron amplitude , if @xmath32 is irrational . moreover , as shown in @xcite simulations with these lattice - independent models are a great help for understanding the peculiar features of spin dynamics for rational @xmath32 and , in particular , on and near `` snake resonances ''",
    ".    however , in high - energy proton rings , the basic spin resonances ( i.e. , without snakes ) of interest might not be well isolated , then a lattice - dependent study is necessary .",
    "for example , as we explain in sections  [ sec : amp ] and  [ sec : tune ] below , doublets of higher - order resonances at irrational @xmath32 can occur near to the @xmath32 of a `` snake resonance '' since @xmath13 need not be 0.5 .",
    "an extensive lattice - dependent study of the behavior of @xmath20 throughout the whole energy range was made in the study of polarized proton beams up to 920  gev in hera  @xcite , as an approach complementary to direct spin tracking for acceleration .",
    "it is also interesting to study @xmath20 for the store conditions of rhic , with a beam energy of 255gev , since this is relevant for the study of polarization variation during physics stores with constant beam energy  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , methods for modeling and simulation based on the polymorphic tracking code  ( ptc ) are described , and in section  [ sec : simulation ] the results of the simulation are presented .",
    "the simulations in this paper utilize the polymorphic tracking code  ( ptc ) developed by e. forest @xcite . designed to model various geometries of particle accelerators ,",
    "ptc is capable of symplectic tracking of the orbital motion and length - preserving transport of spin @xcite , where vectors of particle coordinates and taylor maps can be tracked in a polymorphic manner , and where the latter enables the normal form analysis of the one - turn map using fpp @xcite .",
    "fortran programs have been developed to do the spin tracking , which call ptc as a library .",
    "the modeling of the rhic lattice is presented first , followed by an explanation of the methods of simulation .",
    "the madx model of the rhic lattice is exported into an input file for ptc , which is read by the fortran program .",
    "when a particle is tracked through an integration step of a magnet body , the orbital transfer map is sandwiched in between two spin kicks in equal amounts and each orbital transfer map is a second - order symplectic integrator while each spin kick is represented by a @xmath40 orthogonal rotation matrix .",
    "the quadrupoles must be split into many integration steps to ensure the accuracy of orbital and spin tracking .",
    "an upper limit is set for the spin rotation angle of each integration step , calculated for the betatron amplitude of the tracked particle . in this study , we use about 7 integration steps for each arc quadrupole , and up to 81 integration steps for the quadrupoles in the final focus triplets .",
    "there are two different implementations of a siberian snake in this study .",
    "the first method implements a zero length spin kick that rotates a spin by 180 degrees around an axis in the lattice , namely a `` point - like snake '' , while the second method implements helical dipoles  @xcite into the lattice , namely a `` helical dipole snake '' . in ptc ,",
    "a helical dipole is modeled with a symplectic transfer map accurate to the 4-th order .",
    "note that the longitudinal magnetic field inside helical dipoles will introduce a small transverse coupling at large orbital excursions .",
    "this study implements a pair of diametrically opposed snakes and therefore the closed - orbit spin tune is 0.5 .",
    "note that the spin rotators around ip6 ( interaction point at 6 oclock ) and ip8 ( interaction point at 8 oclock ) are not included in this study , but they can also be modeled in a similar way .",
    "the beam - beam interaction is the major beam - current - dependent effect that might affect the beam polarization during physics stores .",
    "the effect of the beam - beam interaction on the beam polarization was studied through long - term tracking , with a lattice - independent model  @xcite and element - by - element tracking  @xcite , where the beam - beam kick on spin motion was taken into account .",
    "however , the total beam - beam parameter  @xcite from the two ips in rhic is within -0.015 , and the contribution from the linearized beam - beam kick to the intrinsic resonance strength , is less than that of an arc quadrupole  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the beam - beam spin kick is not too important . nevertheless , the beam - beam interaction also introduces an incoherent tune shift for beam particles .",
    "this effect is studied in this work , with a thin - lens weak - strong beam - beam kick implemented for the orbital motion .",
    "the @xmath11-axis is calculated in ptc using stroboscopic averaging  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath11 is computed for a phase space point @xmath3 at an azimuth @xmath2 , a particle is launched at the same location with spin parallel to @xmath11 and tracked for @xmath41 turns .",
    "if none of the three orbital tunes is rational , then the turn - by - turn orbital coordinates trace phase space points on the same torus , and the turn - by - turn spins @xmath42 are the local @xmath11 at the corresponding phase space points .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 can be calculated as an average over @xmath43 for such a phase space torus .",
    "in addition , the amplitude dependent spin tune can be obtained by a fourier analysis of the spin motion according to ref .",
    "so a particle is launched with its spin perpendicular to @xmath11 , and tracked for @xmath41 turns , and a turn - by - turn spin series @xmath44 is obtained .",
    "the naff algorithm @xcite is then applied to calculate the fundamental frequency of the complex series @xmath45 , i.e. , the amplitude dependent spin tune , in the range @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "in this section , the dependence of @xmath47 on various beam parameters is studied for the run 12 baseline lattice of the rhic blue ring , during physics stores .",
    "the default working point is @xmath48 , and @xmath49 at the two interaction points ip6 and ip8 where the detectors star and phenix are located , respectively .",
    "the chromaticities are corrected to @xmath50 with two families of arc sextupoles . @xmath11 and @xmath20 are calculated at ip6 , while @xmath13 is independent of the azimuthal angle .",
    "the betatron amplitudes are normalized with the amplitude corresponding to a normalized 95% emittance of @xmath51 .",
    "two cases with two different beam energies are simulated , and the relevant parameters are shown in table .  [",
