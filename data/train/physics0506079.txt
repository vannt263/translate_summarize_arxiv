    "the study of nonlinear light propagation in periodic photonic lattices has attracted a strong interest due to many possibilities of the light control offered by an interplay between the effects of nonlinearity and periodicity . in particular",
    ", a periodic modulation of the refractive index modifies substantially both the linear spectrum and wave diffraction  @xcite and , consequently , strongly affects the nonlinear propagation and localization of light in the form of optical solitons  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated nonlinear localization of light in the optically - induced photonic lattices where the refractive index is modulated periodically in the transverse direction by an interference pattern of plane waves that illuminate a photorefractive crystal with a strong electro - optic anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "when the lattice - forming waves are polarized orthogonally to the _ c_-axis of the photorefractive crystal , the periodic interference pattern propagates in the diffraction - free linear regime , thus creating a refractive - index modulation similar to that in weakly coupled waveguide array structures  @xcite .",
    "such optically - induced one - dimensional photonic lattices have been employed to demonstrate many fundamental concepts of the linear and nonlinear light propagation in periodic photonic systems , including the generation of lattice  @xcite and spatial gap solitons in defocusing  @xcite and self - focusing  @xcite regimes , bragg scattering and bloch - wave steering  @xcite , tunable negative refraction  @xcite , etc .    in this work",
    ", we study the soliton propagation in dynamic optical lattices and identify novel effects associated with the optically - induced refractive index modulation in the longitudinal direction .",
    "such lattices can be created by several interfering beams , which are inclined at different angles with respect to the crystal . in particular , we consider modulated photonic lattices , created in a photorefractive nonlinear medium by _ three interfering beams _ , as shown in the examples presented in figs .",

    ", where the soliton propagates in one of two allowed directions when the amplitude @xmath46 is in one of the two stable regions .",

    "when the amplitude of the third wave @xmath46 is relatively small , the generated soliton starts moving between the neighboring lattice sites , as shown in the animation . as the amplitude @xmath46 of the modulating beam increases , at certain point strongly localized soliton becomes locked at a particular lattice site , and it propagates _ straight _ along the lattice [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : steering](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission](a ) ] , similar to the case of homogeneous structures without longitudinal modulation  @xcite .",
    "we find that this is the first stable propagation regime which is not sensitive to small variations of the input angle and position [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : transmission](b , c ) ] .",
    "when the amplitude @xmath46 grows further , this leads not only to the increase in the modulation depth of the refractive index , but also to the rotation of the lattice high - index sites .",
    "this rotation causes the change in the topology of the modulated optical lattice and in some interval of the modulation depth there exists no continuous connectivity between the high - index lattice sites ( see animation in fig .",
    "[ fig : steering ] ) . in this regime",
    "the soliton propagation can become highly irregular resembling a regime of random walks , and the soliton can even be completely destroyed by the lattice modulation .    at a certain value of @xmath46 , the rotation of the lattice sites experience saturation ,",
    "the connectivity between the sites reappear ( but now it is diagonal in contrast to the first stable region where it was vertical ) , and the soliton starts to move _ across the lattice _ propagating in the direction determined by the angles of the lattice waves and independent of the value of the modulation amplitude @xmath46 [ see fig .

    "[ fig : steering ] . ]",
    "we can summarize that such _ binary soliton steering _ occurs due to the substantial change in the geometry of the optical lattice , where the connectivity between high - index lattice sites changes from vertical to diagonal through a disconnected state when we increase the amplitude of the third modulating wave , as illustrated by an animation in fig .",
    "[ fig : steering ] . additionally , this binary soliton steering is found to be insensitive to large variations of the soliton amplitude [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : dependences](a ) ] , and the tilt of the soliton increases almost linearly with the difference between the angles of the modulating and lattice - forming beams [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : dependences](b ) ] .",
    "such a behavior is completely different from the dynamics of broad solitons in weakly modulated lattices  @xcite , which feel only spatially averaged , smoothed lattice potential . in contrast , behavior of strongly localized solitons is dominated by the fine geometrical structure of the lattice .",
    "next , we analyze the soliton dynamics in symmetric modulated lattices when @xmath50 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : potentials](a ) . according to the basic principles of holography , a beam which is incident on the lattice at the normal angle ( with @xmath35 ) will excite resonantly the waves corresponding to other lattice - writing beams with the transverse wavenumbers @xmath54 , which will then be converted back to the original wave .",
    "numerical simulations indeed demonstrate that the spectrum of low - amplitude beam is _ modulated periodically _ as it spreads due to linear diffraction , see fig .  [",
    "fig : explosion](a ) .",
    "example of the resonant soliton revivals in the modulated lattices : ( a ) linear diffraction at low power ( @xmath55 ) , ( b ) revivals and periodic transformations of the soliton in the nonlinear regime ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "variation of the intensity ( left ) and spatial fourier spectrum ( right ) of the input gaussian beam along the propagation direction are shown ( spatial frequency @xmath57 is normalized to @xmath58 ) .",
    "parameters are @xmath32 , @xmath59 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 m and the total propagation length is @xmath60 mm . ]    however , even for a weak lattice modulation , the beam dynamics is dramatically modified at higher amplitudes , and we observe a sequence of _ soliton revivals _ , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : explosion](b ) .",
    "we identify three regimes of the soliton propagation : ( i )  self - focusing of the beam which spatial spectrum is centered around the point @xmath61 , ( ii )  transformation of the modes from @xmath61 to larger spatial frequencies , ( iii )  the spectrum conversion back to the region around the point @xmath61 , and again a periodic repetition of this three - stage process .",
    "we note that the period of the soliton revivals does not coincide with the period of the lattice modulation underlying _ a key difference _ with the case of the familiar diffraction - managed solitons  @xcite . in our case",
    ", there exists a continuous coupling and transformation between the modes of the periodic lattice .",
    "more detailed analysis of these results , and discussions of their connection to the effects of soliton internal modes  @xcite or formation of multi - band breathers  @xcite will be presented in a separate study .",
    "we have demonstrated novel effects for the soliton propagation in modulated dynamic optically - induced photonic lattices created by three interfering beams .",
    "we have shown the possibility of binary switching for strongly localized solitons where the soliton can propagate in one of two allowed directions when the amplitude of the control beam is below or above a threshold associated with the transformation of the lattice geometry and a respective change in the connectivity between lattice sites .",
    "each of these regimes is stable with respect to the system parameters , in contrast to earlier considered steering of broad beams directly proportional to the control wave amplitude .",
    "we have also demonstrated novel regimes in the soliton dynamics under the conditions of resonant wave mixing in a conservative system observed as a series of periodic soliton revivals , which are not associated with the effect of diffraction management ."
