    "in twentieth century physics , quantum theory has been a fascinating playground to study the nature of electromagnetic radiations and matter . in this subject , measurement of an unknown state of electromagnetic field poses an interesting question @xcite . after the breakthrough made by tomographic technique @xcite ,",
    "numerous methods such as quantum non - demolition @xcite , quantum endoscopy @xcite and autler townes spectroscopy @xcite , have been suggested . in quantum non demolition ( qnd )",
    "@xcite measurement schemes , field photon number is not altered by measurement process , which includes qnd  measurement via dispersive atom field coupling @xcite , optical kerr effect @xcite and atomic scattering @xcite .",
    "since , momentum distribution of deflected atoms from a quantized cavity field is a function of photon number @xcite of the field , therefore , atomic scattering provides various methods to measure field photon statistics .",
    "two such approaches have been employed : @xmath0 resonant interactions of atoms with a quantized cavity standing light field @xcite ; @xmath1 nonresonant interaction of atoms with the quantized field , which are qantum nondemolition ( qnd ) schemes . in qnd state measurement schemes we reduce field statistics to a single fock state , and then make repeated measurements to reproduce the field statistics @xcite",
    "such schemes have been discussed to measure the field photon number using a phase sensitive detection of atom @xcite and atomic scattering in raman - nath regime @xcite .",
    "atomic scattering using first order of bragg regime has been employed to measure fock state @xcite of a cavity field .    in this paper",
    ", we study deflection of atoms , in any arbitrary order of bragg regime , from a far detuned quantized cavity field . we apply this study to measure any quantum state using qnd state measurement scheme . as an application of this method , we measure coherent state of electromagnetic field in a very high q - cavity .",
    "in addition a set of experimental parameters is provided to perform the experiment within the frame work of the presently available technology .    in sec .  2 , we present experimental model of our system . in sec .  3",
    ", we develop mathematical model of our system describing the dynamics of atom in a quantized cavity field .",
    "we present analytical prescription to study the momentum probability distributions for generalized bragg regime and provide numerical confirmation of the derived results . finally , in sec .  4 , we present our scheme to measure the quantum state of cavity field and successfully apply it to reconstruct coherent state .",
    "we also provide set of experimental parameters to realize the suggested scheme .",
    "we consider a beam of atoms moving with centre of mass momentum @xmath2 towards a cavity field .",
    "the incident atom is in the ground state and the field inside the cavity is an optical standing wave of wavelength , @xmath3 we have the injection rate to be small enough so that only one atom is in the cavity at a time .",
    "moreover , we take large detuning between the cavity field frequency and the atomic transition frequency .",
    "this ensures that atom does not exit the cavity in excited state and there is no spontaneous emission which contributes a photon in arbitrary direction .",
    "the effective rabi frequency of the atom becomes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is coupling constant , and @xmath6 is detuning between the field frequency , @xmath7 and the atomic transition frequency , @xmath8 we probe the atomic scattering by taking the propagation direction at an angle @xmath9 to the normal , satisfying the fresnel approximation . in this approximation the momentum component , @xmath10 normal to the cavity field , is taken very large compared to the component , @xmath11 along the cavity field , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this allows us to treat @xmath12 classically .",
    "we describe the wave function of our system at any time , @xmath13 in discrete momentum space as    @xmath14    here , @xmath15 is the probability amplitude indicating the atom in state @xmath16 at any interaction time @xmath13 exiting with momentum @xmath17 and the cavity with @xmath18 photons@xmath19 the total hamiltonian of the system , in dipole and in rotating wave approximations , is @xmath20 since , in presence of large detuning , the probability of finding the atom in excited state is very small , we may express the atomic dynamics by means of the effective hamiltonian as @xmath21 obtained by applying adiabatic approximation @xcite . during interaction with the field",
    ", for each complete rabi cycle , momentum transferred to the atom by the field is either @xmath22 or @xmath23 @xcite@xmath19 thus momentum of the exiting atom is given as @xmath24 , where , @xmath25 is an even integer .",
    "hence , eq .",
    "@xmath26 leads to a set of infinite coupled rate equations for probability amplitudes @xmath27 , viz .",
    ", @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the recoil frequency of the atom and its initial momentum is taken to be , @xmath30 interestingly , eq .",
    "@xmath31 helps us to study atomic scattering in any regime .    in bragg deflection , recoil frequency of the deflected atom is much larger than effective rabi frequency @xcite , that is @xmath32 by comparing atomic scattering with optical bragg scattering @xcite , we @xcite can develop a condition on initial momentum of the incident atom , viz .",
    "@xmath33 here , @xmath34 , @xmath35 etc . , correspond to first , second , third order of bragg scattering , respectively . by changing the component of momentum ,",
    "@xmath11 parallel to the cavity , we can change the order of bragg scattering .",
    "in this regime , the conservation of energy provides us @xmath36and  @xmath37 which indicate only two possible directions of propagation for the scattered atom , one with initial momentum @xmath38 and the other with momentum @xmath39 respectively , as shown in fig .  1 .    in presence of above mentioned conditions , eq .",
    "@xmath31 yields a set of coupled rate equations from @xmath40 to @xmath41 for bragg regime , viz .",
    "@xmath42    at @xmath40 and at @xmath37 the diagonal terms of above set of coupled equations vanish@xmath19 in the bragg limit , @xmath43 is much larger than @xmath44 , the non - vanishing diagonal elements dominate the evolution .",
    "hence , we ignore , adiabatically , the time derivatives of these probability amplitudes .",
    "also the probability amplitudes outside this range acquire very little probability .",
    "thus , we ignore all the underlined terms in above series . now retaining only lowest order of @xmath45 in the coefficients and back substituting the values , we obtain two coupled equations ( for @xmath46 ) as @xmath47 where , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ^{2}}. \\label{b}\\ ] ] from eqs . @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ", we obtain the probability of atom exiting with momentum @xmath11 i.e. @xmath52 and that of exiting with momentum @xmath53 i.e. @xmath54 as @xmath55 where , @xmath56 is photon statistics . here",
    ", we have used the initial condition that atom enters the cavity with momentum @xmath11 therefore , @xmath57 and @xmath58 thus , we find that the probability of finding the exiting atom in either of the two directions , flips as a function of interaction time @xmath13 with frequency , @xmath59 .    in the simplest case of first order bragg scattering , eq .",
    "@xmath60 provides only two coupled rate equations , that is for @xmath40 and @xmath61 this leads to the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath62    in order to verify our above mentioned analytical results obtained by means of adiabatic approximation and in presence of bragg condition , we exactly solve a system of equations , numerically .",
    "the system of first order linear coupled differential equations is obtained from eq .",
    "@xmath63 from @xmath64 to @xmath65 we solve this set for bragg regime and present the comparison for 2nd order bragg scattering , that is for @xmath66 , in fig .  2 .",
    "we find a good qualitative and quantitative agreement between analytical and numerical results .",
    "qnd measurement process relies on the reduction of field statistics to a single fock state by means of successive atomic interactions and then repeating the reduction process , such that , the statistics of the fock states reproduces field statistics . from eqs . @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 we see that momentum distribution of the scattered atoms depends on the photon statistics inside the cavity . if cavity life time is large compared to the time between injections of atoms , then it is possible to invert eq .",
    "@xmath67 or @xmath69 .",
    "interaction of an atom with the cavity field updates the cavity field statistics in a fashion controlled by its interaction time .",
    "the photon statistics , @xmath70 gets multiplied by oscillatory function , which has periodic maximas and minimas .",
    "the position of the minimas changes with the interaction time of atom with the field .",
    "interaction time of the atom is controlled by controlling the transversal velocity of the atom .",
    "next atom is sent with different interaction time and eliminates some photon numbers in the distribution , until after a few number of atoms only one photon number state is left , which then does not change . by repeating this simulation and counting the number of times each fock state is appearing , we reconstruct the original photon distribution .    in order to apply the procedure",
    "we reconstruct the field statistics of a coherent state developed in the cavity . for an interacting atom undergoing bragg scattering ,",
    "there exists two directions of propagation . since undetected atom",
    "does not alter the distribution , we can fix our detector at one of the two directions .",
    "the reconstruction of photon statistics is based on the conditional probability , @xmath71 where , @xmath25 denotes any of the two directions of propagation of deflected atoms , and @xmath72 is the normalization constant .",
    "each atom enters the cavity with a different transversal velocity and , therefore interacts with the field for a different interaction time .",
    "the new statistics of the cavity field , after the interaction of the atom , updates , having some photon numbers from the field distribution , eliminated .",
    "this way lack of information about the field reduces with each measurement and the whole measurement sequence reduces the field to well defined number state , which then does not change until the field relaxes back to its original state .",
    "we display this procedure in fig .",
    "3 . by displaying a simulation of eleven such atoms , with a nonrelaxing field initially described by a coherent state with on average of 10 photons .",
    "the effective rabi frequency is kept as @xmath73 to remain within the limit of bragg regime , and initial momentum is taken as @xmath74 in order to have @xmath75 order bragg scattering .",
    "we repeat the process of reduction of field statistics to a single fock state and keep record of the number a fock state is appearing .",
    "this leads us to reconstruct the statistics of the coherent field state , as we show in fig .",
    "a comparison of original poisson statistics with the reconstructed one displays a good agreement in fig .  4 .",
    "we can realize the suggested scheme in laboratory by using the experimental set up of ref .",
    "we propagate a beam of rubidium atoms of mass @xmath76 kg , through an optical quantum field of wavelength @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the atom experiences a recoil frequency , @xmath79 khz , while passing through the field , provided it is detuned by an amount @xmath80 mhz . with these parameters at hand , we take @xmath81 khz , such that , @xmath82 in order to realize bragg regime .",
