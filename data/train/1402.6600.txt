    "biomembranes are remarkable structures with both fluid - like and solid - like properties .",
    "the main constituents are amphiphilic lipids , which have a ` head ' part that attracts water and a ` tail ' part that repels it . because of these properties such lipids organize themselves in micelle and bilayer structures , where the head parts shield the lipid tails from the contact with water . without any covalent bonds",
    "the resulting structures resist stretching and bending but still allow the lipids to freely move in the in - plane direction .    in @xcite",
    "a meso - scale model was introduced in the form of an energy for idealized and rescaled head and tail densities .",
    "this model originates from a micro - scale description in which heads and tails are treated as separate particles .",
    "the energy has two contributions : one penalizes the proximity of tail to polar ( head or water ) particles , and the second implements the head - tail connection as an energetic penalization .",
    "a formal upscaling procedure leads to the following meso - scale model ( for the precise definition see section [ sec : setting ] ) .",
    "configurations of head and tail particles are given by two rescaled density functions @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a small parameter and @xmath2 is an @xmath3-independent constant characterizing a total - mass constraint . to such configurations",
    "an energy is assigned by @xmath4 here @xmath5 corresponds to the tail density and the first term in the energy measures the boundary size of its support .",
    "this contribution arises from the interaction energy between tails and polar particles .",
    "the second term in the energy is given by the monge - kantorovich distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see section [ sec : mk ] below ) and is a remnant of the implicit implementation of a head - tail connection .",
    "in  @xcite two of us studied the two - dimensional case and showed that this mesoscale model has some remarkable properties .",
    "first , no structure is a - priori imposed , and quite different configurations can be compared , from a concentration of all @xmath5 mass in a single ball ( this minimizes the first part of the energy ) to arbitrarily dispersed density distributions ( leading to arbitrarily small values for the distance term ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that among all structures the energy prefers bilayer structures , and in this sense the model provides an explanation of the fundamental setup and stability of amphiphilic membranes .",
    "secondly , the mathematical analysis of the model confirms that the model in fact shows the key properties of biomembranes , namely a preference for uniformly thin structures without ends ( resistance to stretching and rupture ) and a resistance to bending of the structure . in @xcite",
    "this behavior was made precise by a passage to a macro - scale model and a rigorous gamma - convergence result in two space dimensions .",
    "in that limit the densities concentrate on families of @xmath7-curves and a generalized euler elastica energy is obtained for moderate - energy structures .",
    "besides its application to biophysics the analysis of the energy also leads to an interesting and challenging mathematical problem .",
    "the energy is a combination of a local and a non - local contribution with competing preferences for maximally concentrated and maximally dispersed configurations . in the limit we see a transition from density functions that are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure to concentration on lower - dimensional structures .",
    "in addition there is a change of order : whereas only first derivatives appear in the meso - scale energy , the macro - scale energy is defined in terms of local curvature of the bilayer .    in recent years",
    "we have seen an increasing interest in meso - scale models for biomembranes , see for example  @xcite . related but different models that describe an interaction of a surface area and a competing nonlinear term arise in many situations and have been studied intensively over the last years , see for example the analysis in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is to extend key parts of the previous analysis to three space dimensions : a general lower bound estimate , a formal derivation of the macroscopic limit @xmath8 , and a rigorous upper bound that matches the formal limit . for the lower estimate we show that the mass transport problem that defines the @xmath9 distance induces a unit - length vector field @xmath10 on the boundary @xmath11 of the support of @xmath5 , related to the direction of _ transport rays _ through the corresponding point .",
    "we show that such rays are countably lipschitz continuous , and we use the rays to introduce a function @xmath12 on @xmath11 that describes the mass transported through that point and that is closely related to the thickness of the @xmath5 layer .",
    "the key estimate   states that the difference of @xmath12 from a constant and the deviation of the ray direction @xmath10 from the outer normal direction of @xmath11 is penalized at order @xmath13 , whereas at zeroth order we find a quadratic form in the derivatives of @xmath10 .",
    "formally this estimate gives a corresponding compactness statement and a corresponding lim - inf estimate : the head and tail densities @xmath6 and @xmath5 concentrate on two - dimensional surfaces without boundary and for such structures the limit energy is given by a surface integral over a positive quadratic form in the principal curvatures of that surface .",
    "this formal lim - inf estimate is complemented by the construction of a recovery sequence and a matching upper bound .",
    "we give a precise description of the results in section [ sec : setting ] .    whereas the main line of argument for the lower bound is analogous to the previous analysis in @xcite",
    ", important differences occur at many places of the proof and require substantial changes .",
    "the construction of a recovery sequence is much more involved than the corresponding construction for curves .",
    "we do not give a rigorous compactness and lim - inf estimate in the limit of vanishing @xmath1 .",
    "this indeed is the most challenging part of a complete gamma convergence statement . for a simplified situation a corresponding lim - inf estimate and",
    "compactness result will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the mesoscale energy and state our main results . in section  [ sec : mk ] we review some results of the monge  kantorovich optimal mass transport problem and prove the lower - bound estimate . in the last section we give the construction of a recovery sequence and prove the upper - bound estimate .",
