    "explaining the origin of short - period ( sp ) comets ( periods @xmath7 yr ) is a long - standing problem .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the differences and apparent inconsistency between the respective numbers and orbital distributions of jupiter - family ( jf ) and halley - type ( ht ) comets .",
    "these we classify using the tisserand parameter @xmath8 with respect to jupiter ( carusi et al .",
    "1987 ) , jf comets having @xmath9 ( and @xmath10 usually below 20 years ) , ht comets having @xmath11 ( and @xmath10 usually between 20 and 200 years ) .",
    "when sp comets are classified this way the number of observed ht comets is found to be less than , or at most comparable to , the number of observed jf comets ( see section [ obs - sp ] below ) .",
    "however , most dynamical theories of their origin from the near - parabolic flux predict a far greater proportion of ht comets ( emelyanenko and bailey 1998 ) , with the overall number of observed jf comets conversely being much too large relative to the calculated number ( joss 1973 ; delsemme 1973 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is associated with the well - known fading problem for long - period comets originating in the oort cloud and has , at least in part , led to the idea that the two classes of sp comet may have different physical structures and different proximate sources in the present solar system .",
    "thus , although there have been many advances in understanding the diverse populations of small bodies in the solar system , neither a single source dominated by trans - neptunian objects nor one dominated by the traditional oort cloud near - parabolic flux at small perihelion distances seems capable of explaining the entire distribution of orbital elements of sp comets . in particular the observed jf comet inclination distribution was recognized to have too many comets at low @xmath12 relative to the calculated distribution ( duncan et al .",
    "1988 ; quinn et al .  1990 ) .    for these reasons ,",
    "the majority of authors nowadays consider jf and ht comets to be physically as well as dynamically distinct classes , presumably formed in separate regions of the early solar system and having different dynamical and physical evolutionary histories . under this viewpoint ,",
    "jf comets are often regarded as originating largely in the proto - planetary disc beyond neptune , for example in or close to the edgeworth - kuiper belt ( ekb ) .",
    "the idea that jf comets might originate in a primordial disc or ` belt ' of comets located near or beyond the orbit of neptune was investigated by a number of authors ( e.g.  fernndez 1980 , 1982 ; duncan et al .",
    "1988 ; torbett 1989 ; torbett and smoluchowski 1990 ; quinn et al .",
    "the discovery of 1992 qb@xmath13 ( jewitt and luu 1993 ) and of further edgeworth - kuiper objects played a pivotal role in theories of the origin of sp comets , and important advances building on this evidence were made in particular by duncan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , duncan and levison ( 1997 ) , levison and duncan ( 1997 ) , and levison et al .",
    "a key point ( duncan and levison 1997 ) was recognition of the potentially important role played by the ` scattered ' disc , introduced by torbett ( 1989 ) and detected a few years later ( luu et al .",
    "1997 ) , in which it appears that the scattered disc of primordial objects originally formed in the region of the major planets is the principal source of observed jf comets , rather than the ekb . under the viewpoint of distinct jf and ht classes ,",
    "ht comets are regarded as objects captured from the oort cloud ( levison et al .",
    "2001 ) , a structure that would have been produced inevitably as a by - product of planetary , stellar and other perturbations acting on planetesimals or cometary nuclei originally formed by accretion within the planetary region of the proto - planetary disc .    however , a rather unsatisfactory feature of this general picture is the assumption that ht comets coming from the oort cloud must disintegrate very quickly in order to explain the small number of objects observed ( emelyanenko and bailey 1998 ; levison et al .",
    "the number of observed inert ht ` asteroids ' is also very small , and it seems as if the disintegration of a kilometre - size comet nucleus , into presumably an initial trail of much smaller boulder - size objects and then finally dust , must proceed fairly rapidly and lead to eventual extinction of the original comet .",
    "on the other hand , dynamical theories appear to require that a high proportion of the jf comet source flux should survive dynamical transfer into the inner solar system to become active jf comets and that these jf comets should survive for @xmath610@xmath14 revolutions in the inner solar system .",
    "this difference in the physico - dynamical evolution of the two types of objects is the fading problem for sp comets .",
    "it is probably not unreasonable to assume that comets that formed in different parts of the proto - planetary disc have different physical properties and therefore different lifetimes in the observable region , and it appears that this idea has become very deeply rooted",
    ". what is missing , however , is direct observational evidence to support the idea of two qualitatively distinct types of sp comet , correlating with dynamical class .",
    "thus , present theories of the origin of sp comets rely on a poorly understood fading hypothesis to accommodate the observations , and there is no satisfactory physico - dynamical explanation as to why two very different types of sp comet should exist and yet appear observationally almost indistinguishable .",
    "indeed , although comets show a very diverse range of properties , covering a very broad range of sizes , densities , dust - to - gas ratios and so on , there is as yet no compelling observational evidence for the expected bimodality of physical characteristics corresponding to ht versus jf dynamical class ( lamy et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this work ,",
    "whilst recognizing that comets may have different physical properties depending for example on their sizes or where they might have formed in the proto - planetary disc , we present a model for the common origin and evolution  from the oort cloud  of the majority of comets in the solar system .",
    "we define the oort cloud as the region containing objects with semimajor axes @xmath15 au  ( i.e. , objects from the oort cloud have at some point during their evolution reached @xmath15 au ) .",
    "this definition is consistent with those used by other authors ; e.g.wiegert and tremaine ( 1999 ) and rickman et al .  (",
    "2008 ) used similar values of semimajor axis , i.e. @xmath16 au , to define the inner boundary of the oort cloud .",
    "dones et al.(2004 ) introduced a further restriction , namely that the maximum value of perihelion distance @xmath17 during an object s orbital evolution should exceed 45 au  for it to be counted as an ` oort cloud ' object .",
    "however , objects with @xmath18 au  spend nearly all their time at large heliocentric distances , whatever their value of @xmath17 , and therefore in the oort cloud .    in this paper",
    "we have chosen to define oort - cloud objects solely according to @xmath19 because the influence of stellar and galactic perturbations is determined mainly by @xmath19 for near - parabolic orbits .",
    "it has been shown ( e.g.  emelyanenko 2005 ) that the dynamical pathways by which objects with @xmath15  aureach the planetary region are different from those of typical trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) .",
    "while the evolution of tnos is largely determined only by planetary perturbations , stellar and galactic perturbations play a more substantial role in the process that drives the perihelia of objects with @xmath15 au  towards and through the planetary region , regardless of their previous @xmath17 .    in the present paper ( section [ integ ] onwards )",
    "we numerically integrate a much larger number of objects than in the oort cloud model of emelyanenko et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in particular to obtain statistically significant numbers of sp comets captured from the oort cloud and allow a comparison of the model sp numbers and orbital distributions with the corresponding distributions of observed ht and jf comets .",
    "first ( section [ obs - com ] ) , in order that our model parameters can be constrained by observations , we assess the known characteristics of the various populations of cometary bodies .",
    "we took data from the mpc ( minor planet center ) and jpl ( jet propulsion laboratory ) lists of discovered comets with @xmath7 yr and @xmath5 au  near the present epoch .",
    "the completeness level in the discovery of sp comets is slightly uncertain , especially for ht comets and when results are extrapolated to fainter magnitudes and larger perihelion distances .",
    "however , many discussions ( e.g.  fernndez et al .  1999 ; levison et al .",
    "2001 ) have indicated a relatively high degree of completeness in the observed sample of active comets at small perihelion distances ( @xmath5 au ) .",
    "this level of completeness is supported too by studies of long - period comets , essentially none of which have been missed at @xmath20 au  since 1985 ( fernndez and sosa 2012 ) .",
    "we excluded soho comets because these have rather uncertain physical and dynamical characteristics ; this only affects the distribution near very small @xmath17 , a region that we do not study here .",
    "we also excluded multiple - apparition comets that have not been observed for a number of revolutions and are now treated as dead or inert . for split comets we took only the orbit of the main nucleus . in the end",
    "we obtained a list of 103 observed objects that we regard as representing the present - day set of active sp comets with @xmath5 au .",
    "of these , 75 have @xmath9 ( jf comets ) and 28 have @xmath11 ( ht comets ) .     and @xmath19 for observed short - period comets with @xmath5 au . ]     and @xmath12 for observed short - period comets with @xmath5 au . ]    figures [ atql1.5 ] and [ itql1.5 ] present orbital element distributions of these observed objects .",
    "the inclinations ( figure [ itql1.5 ] ) show jf comets ( @xmath9 ) are concentrated close to the ecliptic and prograde ht comets outnumber retrograde ones ( fernndez and gallardo 1994 ; levison et al.2001 ) .",
    "additionally the intrinsic numbers of jf and ht comets are a key constraint for our model .",
    "fernndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that about a hundred active jf comets should currently exist in the region @xmath5 au , down to nuclear radius @xmath21@xmath60.7 km .",
    "the number appears to drop very rapidly for smaller bodies ( fernndez et al .",
    "1999 ; snodgrass et al .",
    "this estimate could be modified to take account of more recent comet discoveries ( cf .",
    "section 2.1 of di sisto et al .  2009 ) but the result would not be significantly changed .    for ht comets , their longer",
    "average orbital periods constitute the principal bias against their discovery relative to jf comets .",
    "that is , although we expect that most active comets passing perihelion with sufficiently small @xmath17 will be found at the current level of observational searches , many ht comets have not yet returned to perihelion during the last few decades when searches have been at such levels . in this way , taking account of the ht period distribution , levison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , from 22 observed ht comets with @xmath22au , estimated a population of 57 active ht comets ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this result can be extrapolated to about a hundred objects with @xmath5 au . in a later paper ( levison et al .",
    "2006 ) the observed number has only increased to 24 , suggesting the estimate is reliable .",
    "we conclude that there are roughly a hundred active jf comets and a comparable number , i.e.approximately a hundred , of active ht comets to be explained in the region @xmath5 au  at times near the present epoch .",
    "certainly the number of already known active jf comets shows that their intrinsic number can not be much below a hundred , while the intrinsic ht number can not be much above a hundred without implausibly many bright comets being missed by observational searches .",
    "the flux of dynamically new comets from the oort cloud is a fundamental parameter underpinning all dynamical models of the small - body populations in the solar system , including the estimates in this paper .",
    "there are uncertainties in the frequency , @xmath23 , of comets with @xmath24 au  passing perihelion per au  in @xmath17 per year , but @xmath23 is usually estimated to lie in the range 2 to 4 for present - day comets in near - earth space ( bailey and stagg 1988 ; fernndez and gallardo 1999 ; wiegert and tremaine 1999 ; francis 2005 ) . for quantitative estimates in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath25 , within the observable region @xmath5 au .",
    "francis ( 2005 ) undertook a detailed discussion of the objects that the linear survey should discover for a given intrinsic cometary population .",
    "considering also the question of the cometary absolute magnitude distribution , he found that very faint ( on average presumably smaller ) comets are only slightly more abundant than somewhat brighter ( presumably larger ) ones .",
    "thus statements about cometary numbers , while evidently depending in detail on the adopted absolute - magnitude cutoff , are not strongly dependent on the precise value of that cutoff . in order to fix ideas , our adopted value @xmath26 comets with @xmath24 au  passing perihelion per au  in @xmath17 per year may be assumed to apply to comets with total visual absolute magnitudes @xmath27 .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the magnitude normalized to 1 au  from earth and sun ( e.g.  everhart 1967 ) .",
    "the inclusion of fainter comets ( e.g.  extrapolating results from @xmath28 = 11 to @xmath29 ) makes very little practical difference to our results ( francis 2005 ; sosa and fernndez 2011 ) , although the calibration factor , @xmath23 , would of course increase .",
    "the relative lack of very small ( diameters @xmath30 km ) comets ( fernndez and sosa 2012 ) suggests that the physical response of the smallest dynamically ` new ' comets from the oort cloud to the thermal shock of their first passage at small perihelion provides a clue to the underlying rapid fading of new comets from the oort cloud , necessary to explain the detailed shape of the observed @xmath31-distribution ( cf .",
    "bailey 1984 ) .",
    ".centaurs ( objects with @xmath32 au  and @xmath3  au , excluding a few resonant trans - neptunian objects and trojans ) that have a probable source in the oort cloud .",
    "the majority of such objects have @xmath33 au  and after observational debiasing would be extremely numerous .",
    "centaurs with @xmath34 au  are listed if @xmath35 . only centaurs with an observational arc larger than 100 days ( asteroid orbits from mpc ) and comets of orbital classes 1 and 2 ( marsden and williams 2008 ) are included .",

    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the data of table  [ nmod ] show that almost all jf comets originate from orbits with initial perihelia in the outer planetary system , and that over 90% of the steady - state number of ht comets come from the same @xmath72 au  region .",
    "this indicates that the majority of observed ht comets would have had initial orbits with perihelion distances largely overlapping the range of perihelia of the objects that eventually became jf comets .",
    "this is in contrast to the general picture described in section  1 , where jf comets largely originate from initial orbits in the trans - neptunian region and ht comets from initial orbits in the region of the giant planets , with subsequent very different dynamical histories .",
    "for all the models in table [ dmod ] , the orbital distributions of sp objects with @xmath5 au  coming from the oort cloud have similar characteristics .",
    "figures [ atall ] and [ itall ] show the orbital element distributions in perihelia ( i.e.  equal weight to each perihelion passage ) for sp objects with @xmath5 au  coming from the oort cloud , applying the restrictions @xmath61 , @xmath60 , @xmath59 ( all objects are equally presented , thus formally @xmath76 in these plots ) .",
    "the figures show that in our model , jf comets ( @xmath9 ) are concentrated near the ecliptic plane , approximately 70% of them having @xmath77 . regarding ht comets ( @xmath11 ) , although the model reveals both prograde and retrograde orbits , prograde ht comets outnumber retrograde ones . in these ways",
    "the basic features of these distributions are consistent with those of the observed distributions in figures [ atql1.5 ] and [ itql1.5 ] .    in our model , all the modelled objects with periods under 20 yr have inclinations @xmath78 .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , the majority of objects captured to the jf population originate from the inner oort cloud ( emelyanenko 2005 ) . in our model ,",
    "the inner oort cloud is a rather flattened source of comets ( emelyanenko et al .  2007 ) .",
    "secondly , the majority of such objects are injected from the inner oort cloud on to orbits with perihelia in the region of the outer planets by external perturbations .",
    "their subsequent evolution is similar to the scheme described for trans - neptunian objects by kazimirchak - polonskaya ( 1972 ) and levison and duncan ( 1997 ) .",
    "the latter showed that preferentially objects with tisserand parameters near 3 with respect to a planet cross the orbit of this planet .",
    "this suggests that mainly objects on prograde orbits are transferred to the inner planetary region .    our results  from analysing observed sp comets  about the initial distribution of objects that form the oort cloud are consistent with the standard picture of the origin of the solar system .",
    "the conclusion was that @xmath79 : this corresponds to comets originally from the outer planetary region having a greater probability of survival and thus a longer lifetime as active comets , with objects originating from regions with small heliocentric distances conversely becoming extinct more quickly .",
    "this accords with the amount of water ( as the main driver of cometary activity ) being larger for more distant objects in the early solar system .",
    "we have developed a model of the origin and evolution of the oort cloud which is consistent with the basic observed orbital distributions of comets , centaurs and high - eccentricity trans - neptunian objects . rather than requiring intrinsically different fading properties for jupiter - family and halley - type short - period comets ,",
    "the model instead adopts the hypothesis that the physical lifetime of objects as active comets in the inner planetary region at the present epoch is a function of their initial perihelion distance in the early solar system , and is the same for both jf and ht comets .",
    "the observed jf and ht populations also constrain the initial distribution of objects versus perihelion distance .",
    "our results show that :    1 .",
    "the mean physical lifetime of comets is @xmath80200 revolutions in the region @xmath5 au .",
    "this implies a significant cometary contribution to the distribution of small bodies ( ` boulders ' and dust ) making up the near - earth interplanetary complex .",
    "2 .   no model in which the initial number of comets is a decreasing function of their initial perihelion distance @xmath62 in the early solar system can explain the present observed distribution of short - period comets .",
    "3 .   models in which the initial distribution of objects versus perihelion distance is concentrated more towards the outer planetary region , and in which their present active physical lifetime is an increasing function of @xmath62 , are consistent with the present orbital distributions and numbers of both ht and jf comets . 4 .",
    "essentially all the observed ht comets and nearly half the observed jf comets come from a proximate oort - cloud source ( i.e.  have experienced orbits with @xmath81 au ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath650% of observed jf comets come from the _ observed _ near - neptune high - eccentricity ( nnhe ) population , a dynamically unstable region in which the cometary numbers decline by 95% over 4 gyr .",
    "in addition , more than 90% of all centaurs ( @xmath2 au , @xmath3 au ) come from the oort cloud .",
    "the model predicts that there is a significant oort - cloud contribution to the nnhe population .",
