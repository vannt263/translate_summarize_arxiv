    "these notes are based on a series of talks at the cimpa summer school on algebraic geometry and hypergeometric functions held in istanbul in summer of 2005 .",
    "the topic of the talks was an introduction to a recent work of various people on the complex ball uniformization of the moduli spaces of del pezzo surfaces and algebraic curves of lower genus ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite ) . keeping in mind the diverse background of the audimore emphasis on abelian varieties and k3 surfaces",
    "so , an expert may start reading the notes from section 7 .",
    "it has been known for more than a century that a complex structure on a riemann surface of genus @xmath0 is determined up to isomorphism by the period matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a basis of 1-homology and @xmath3 is a basis of holomorphic 1-forms .",
    "it is possible to choose the bases in a such a way that the matrix @xmath4 has the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a symmetric complex matrix of size @xmath0 with positive definite imaginary part .",
    "all such matrices are parametrized by a complex domain @xmath7 in @xmath8 which is homogeneous with respect to the group @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , it represents an example of a hermitian symmetric space of non - compact type , a siegel half - plane of degree @xmath0 . a different choice of bases with the above property of the period matrix corresponds to a natural action of the group @xmath10 on @xmath7 .",
    "in this way the moduli space @xmath11 of complex structures on riemann surfaces of genus g admits a holomorphic map to the orbit space @xmath12 which is called the period map .",
    "the fundamental fact is the torelli theorem which asserts that this map is an isomorphism onto its image .",
    "this gives a moduli theoretical interpretation of some points of the orbit space .",
    "all points can be interpreted as the period matrices of principally polarized abelian varieties , i.e. @xmath0-dimensional complex tori equipped with an ample line bundle whose space of holomorphic sections is one - dimensional . in this way",
    "the orbit space @xmath12 becomes isomorphic to the moduli space @xmath13 of such complex tori .",
    "the siegel half - plane @xmath7 is a hermitian symmetric space of non - compact type iii in cartan s classification .",
    "the development of the general theory of periods of integrals on algebraic varieties in the sixties due to p. griffiths raised a natural question on moduli - theoretical interpretation of other hermitian summetric spaces and their arithmetic quotients and the analogs of the torelli theorem .",
    "for the spaces of classical types i - iv , this can be achieved by embedding any type space into a siegel half - plane , and introducing the moduli space of abelian varieties with some additional structure ( like a level , complex multiplication or some tensor form on cohomology ) .",
    "all of this becomes a part of the fancy theory of shimura varieties .",
    "however , a more explicit interpretation remains to be searched for .",
    "for the type iv hermitian symmetric space of dimension @xmath14 such an interpretation had been found in terms of moduli of complex algebraic surfaces of type k3 .",
    "the fundamental result of i. piatetsky - shapiro and i. shafarevich in the seventies gives an analog of the torelli theorem for polarized algebraic k3 surfaces .",
    "although this gives only a realization of the 19-dimensional type iv space by a very special arithmetic group depending only on the degree of the polarization , a modified version of the polarization structure due to v. nikulin , allows one to extend this construction to type iv space of any dimension @xmath15 with a variety of arithmetric groups realized as certain orthogonal groups of integral quadratic forms of signature @xmath16 .",
    "recently , some arithmetic quotients of type iv domain of dimension 20 have been realized as periods of holomorphic symplectic manifolds of dimension 4 .",
    "a complex ball is an example of hermitian symmetric space of type i. some of its arithmetic quotients have a realization as periods of hypergeometric differential forms via the deligne - mostow theory .",
    "we refer for the details to looijenga s article in the same volume @xcite .",
    "a hypergeometric differential form has an interpretation as a holomorphic 1-form on a certain algebraic curve on which a cyclic group acts by automorphisms and the form is transformed according to a character of this group . in section 7 of our paper",
    "we discuss in more general setting the theory of what we call eigenperiods of algebraic varieties .",
    "the periods of hypergeometric functions allows one to realize some complex ball quotients as the moduli space of weighted semi - stable ordered point sets in projective line modulo projective equivalence . in some cases these moduli spaces",
    "are isomorphic to moduli spaces of other structures .",
    "for example , via the period map of algebraic curves , the hypergeometric complex ball quotients are mapped onto a subvariety of @xmath13 parametrizing principally polarized abelian varieties with a certain cyclic group action .",
    "for example , the moduli space of 6 points with equal weights defines a curve of genus 4 admitting a cyclic triple cover of the projective line ramified at the 6 points .",
    "its jacobian variety is an abelian variety of dimension 4 with a cyclic group of order 3 acting by automorphism of certain type .",
    "the moduli space of such abelian varieties is a complex ball quotient .",
    "another example is the moduli space of equally marked sets of 5 points which leads to the moduli space of marked del pezzo surfaces of degree 4 @xcite .",
    "other examples relating the arithmetic complex ball quotients arising in the deligne - mostow theory to moduli spaces of del pezzo surfaces were found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all of these examples are intimately related to the moduli space of k3 surfaces with specail structure of its picard group of algebraic cycles and an action of a cyclic group . in section 11",
    "we develop a general theory of such moduli spaces . in section 12",
    "we briefly discuss all the known examples of moduli spaces of del pezzo surfaces and curves of low genus which are isomorphic to the moduli space of such structres on k3 surfaces , and via this isomorphism admit a complex ball uniformization by an arithmetic group . some of these examples arise from the deligne - mostow theory . in the last section 12",
    "we discuss a relationship between deligne - mostow arithmetic complex ball quotients and the moduli spaces of k3 surfaces with a cyclic group action .",
    "we would like to thank the organizers of the summer school , and especially professor a. muhammed uludag for the hospitality and for providing a stimulating and pleasant audience for our lectures .",
    "in this and next four sections we give a brief introduction to the hodge theory of periods of integrals on algebraic varieties .",
    "we refer for details to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "now suppose @xmath17 is the underlying differentiable structure of a compex manifold @xmath37",
    ". then local coordinates @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of complex coordinates @xmath39 and its conjugates @xmath40 .",
    "this allows us to express locally a smooth @xmath31-form as a sum of forms of type @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are smooth complex - valued functions .",

    "@xmath49 ) . the dolbeaut theorem gives an isomorphism @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the sheaf of holomorphic @xmath52-forms , i.e. forms from of type @xmath53 , where the coefficients are holomorphic functions .",
    "the dolbeaut theorem generalizes a well - known fact that a smooth function @xmath54 of a complex variable is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the equation @xmath55 .",
    "a structure of a complex manifold @xmath37 on a smooth manifold gives a decomposition of the complexified tangent bundle @xmath56 into a holomorphic and anti - holomorphic part with local basis @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",

    "an additional structure of a hermitian complex manifold on @xmath37 is given by a choice of a holomorphically varying structures of a hermitian vector space on tangent spaces @xmath60 defined by a tensor @xmath61 it allows one to define the adjoint operator @xmath62 of @xmath47 , the laplace operator @xmath63 , and the notion of a _ harmonic form _ of type @xmath41 ( an element of the kernel of the laplace operator ) .",
    "one shows that each @xmath47-closed form of type @xmath41 is @xmath47-cohomologous to a unique harmonic form of type @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , there is a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the space of harmonic forms of type @xmath41 . on the other hand",
