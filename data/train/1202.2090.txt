    "properties of minimum bias and the underlying event have previously been studied over a wide range of energies . in particular , results from experiments at cern and fermilab have been used to tune the pythia  @xcite and phojet  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) event generators . due to uncertainties in the modeling of the energy dependence of soft inelastic interactions ,",
    "these generators give widely varying predictions at lhc energies .",
    "recent results from the atlas collaboration are presented here and compared to these predictions .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite is a proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) collider located at cern and currently operating at a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of @xmath2 .",
    "it is designed to go up to twice that energy , with an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath3@xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "atlas  @xcite is a @xmath6 general - purpose detector designed for high - luminosity studies at the lhc .",
    "layers of tracking detectors , calorimeters and muon chambers cover almost the entire solid angle around atlas .",
    "the inner detector ( i d ) is responsible for tracking charged particles within a pseudorapidity range of @xmath7.,@xmath8 ) are used in the plane transverse to the beam axis , @xmath8 being the azimuthal angle around the beam axis .",
    "the pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle @xmath9 with respect to the beam axis as @xmath10 .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath11 is defined relative to the beam axis . ]",
    "it consists of a multi - layer silicon tracker with both pixels and strips , in addition to a transition radiation straw tracker , all of which are immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 t.    the calorimeters surround the inner detector and are responsible for measuring the energies of charged and neutral particles within a pseudorapidity range of @xmath12 .",
    "the calorimeters are specialized for measuring electromagnetic or hadronic particles , the latter of which include jets of particles formed by hadronization of quarks and gluons .",
    "they also detect missing transverse energy ( ) by summing all of the measured energy deposits .",
    "the atlas detector has a three - level trigger system . for the measurements presented",
    "herein , the first level trigger ( l1 ) relies on the beam pickup timing devices ( bptx ) and the minimum bias trigger scintillators ( mbts ) .",
    "the bptx are composed of electrostatic beam pickups attached to the beam pipe at a distance @xmath13 m from the center of the atlas detector .",
    "the mbts are mounted at each end of the detector in front of the endcap - calorimeter cryostats at @xmath14 m and are segmented into eight sectors in azimuth and two rings in pseudorapidity ( 2.09 @xmath15 2.82 and 2.82 @xmath15 3.84 ) .",
    "all physics at the lhc essentially comes from the interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "hard processes are characterized by high transverse momentum ( ) and are well described by perturbative qcd .",
    "soft interactions , on the other hand , are characterized by low transverse momentum and require non - perturbative phenomenological models .",
    "these soft interactions are actually the dominant processes at the lhc .",
    "they can include diffraction , multiple - partonic interactions ( mpi ) , soft initial- and final - state radiation ( isr / fsr ) , as well as beam - beam remnants .    while these are all separate phenomena , the different components are often grouped according to experimental trigger .",
    "minimum bias ( mb ) interactions , for example , are the processes that are selected with a loose trigger intended to select inelastic collisions with as little bias as possible .",
    "the underlying event ( ue ) is the collection of all the soft processes that accompany a high - interaction of interest .",
    "it is typically studied as a function of the highest - particle in the event .",
    "modeling of these soft interactions is important because they impact all other high - measurements . at higher luminosities , for example",
    ", minimum bias interactions are a major background , numbering up to 25 interactions on average per bunch crossing at lhc design luminosity .",
    "a proper model of the ue is also important for precise high - measurements since it can affect the  resolution , lepton identification and jet resolution .",
    "studying the ue is critical for understanding the evolution of qcd with collision energy , as well as understanding the systematic corrections on many studies such as mass measurements .",
    "while soft qcd is modeled by some mc generators , including pythia , phojet and herwig / jimmy  @xcite , it tends to be phenomenological , requiring tuning to data . however , non - perturbative effects , such as soft diffraction , hadronization and low - parton scattering , are difficult to separate experimentally .",
    "also , the description of hard processes by the mc generators must be preserved while tuning the soft processes .",
    "the results presented here show that it is difficult to describe both mb and the ue with the same parameters .",
    "the measurements presented here were made using @xmath1 collision data recorded at @xmath0 , 2.36 and 7during low - luminosity running of the lhc in 2009 and the beginning of 2010 .",
    "the low instantaneous luminosity ensures that there are relatively few overlapping @xmath1 collisions in each bunch crossing ( a background known as _ pile - up _ ) , important when measuring soft - qcd observables .",
    "data were collected with stable colliding beams and correspond to an integrated luminosity of @xmath16b@xmath5 .",
    "events were selected using a single - arm mbts trigger , formed from bptx and mbts l1 trigger signals .",
    "the mbts trigger was configured to require one hit above threshold on either side of the detector ( 2.09 @xmath15 3.84 ) .",
    "events were additionally required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex , while also vetoing events with a second primary vertex with 4 or more tracks .",
    "this event selection imposes little bias on the measurements presented here , while reducing the contribution from empty events , beam background and pile - up events to a negligible level .",
    "tracks were selected by requiring their and @xmath17 to be within the specified phase space of the measurement .",
    "a good track quality was ensured by requiring a minimum number of hits in the silicon detectors , dependent on the of the track .",
    "tracks associated to particles coming from the primary interaction ( known as _ _",
    "primary__s originating from the primary interaction or from subsequent decay of particles with shorter lifetime . ] particles ) were selected by requiring their impact parameters , measured with respect to the reconstructed primary vertex of the event , to be within a specified range .",
    "data shown here have been fully corrected back to particle level in order to measure the distributions of stable ( charged ) particles coming from the primary @xmath1 interaction .",
    "this allows a direct comparison to mc generator predictions .",
    "corrections are applied at both the event and track level .",
    "the event - level corrections correct for missing events due to trigger and vertex requirements . both trigger and vertex corrections were derived from data , the former by measuring the trigger efficiency of the mbts with respect to a control trigger using the inner detector and the latter by directly measuring the primary vertex reconstruction efficiency using all triggered events .",
    "the track - level corrections correct for detector inefficiencies and resolutions . the tracking efficiency was derived from mc samples taken through the full geant  @xcite detector simulation .",
    "the track - level corrections were applied in two dimensions ( @xmath17 , @xmath11 ) in order to eliminate most of the model dependence .",
    "corrections for non - primary particles and particles outside of the kinematic range were also applied .",
    "all corrections were derived separately for the different analyses and phase space regions .",
    "measurements were not extrapolated into regions of phase space not seen by the detector ( e.g. very low - or far - forward particles ) .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for the contribution coming from diffractive processes ; however , phase space regions with a suppressed diffractive component were considered ( see table  [ table : mbphasespace ] ) .",
    "the event selection at the particle level is always well defined and reproducible , e.g. number of charged particles @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath7 .",
    "` minimum bias ' is an experimentally defined term , referring to the selection of inelastic events with the minimum possible requirements necessary to ensure that an inelastic collision occurred .",
    "minimum bias events can include both non - diffractive and diffractive processes , although the precise definition and relative contributions vary among experiments and analyses . typically , minimum bias events are dominated by soft interactions , with low transverse momentum and low particle multiplicity .",
    "the atlas mbts trigger ( see section  [ section : eventselection ] ) is almost fully efficient , with a slightly lower efficiency in low - events . in an attempt to disentangle the effects coming from diffractive processes",
