    "the phenomenon , a term coined by thorstensen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , is common to a set of nova - like cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) which share the same peculiar but consistent spectroscopic behaviour .",
    "this group of cvs originally comprised only eclipsing systems with orbital periods in the range 34 hr .",
    "all of these systems exhibit strong single - peaked balmer , and emission lines which , with the exception of , remain largely unobscured during primary eclipse .",
    "in addition , the radial velocity curves of balmer and lines show significant phase lags relative to the photometric ephemeris . furthermore",
    ", these emission lines display absorption components which show maximum depth at phases opposite primary eclipse ( szkody & pich @xcite ) .    given that all of the original members of the class are eclipsing cvs ,",
    "a number of authors have speculated that the various peculiar phenomena exhibited by the stars are a consequence of their high orbital inclinations .",
    "this assumption was thrown into doubt when a number of supposed low - inclination members of the class were discovered , including ( beuermann et al .",
    "@xcite ; hellier et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ( casares et al .",
    "@xcite ; dickinson et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ( rodr guez - gil et al . @xcite ; martnez - pais et al .",
    "@xcite ; taylor et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ( hoard & szkody @xcite ) .",
    "although these systems present the same spectroscopic properties as their high - inclination partners ( with the exception of the occurrence of eclipses ) , there is still some controversy about whether they really are the low - inclination counterparts of stars . in this paper",
    "we will show that the best example of a proposed low - inclination star , , exhibits eclipses and is actually a high - inclination star .",
    "( also known as ) is one of a number of cvs discovered by the palomar - green ( pg ) survey for ultraviolet excess objects ( green et al .",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) undertook the first spectroscopic study of this star , finding an orbital period of 0.13934@xmath50.00006 d. this work also showed that displays many of the characteristic peculiarities of the systems . after detecting the absence of eclipses , the authors suggested that could be a low - inclination star . until then",
    ", the only photometric data available were those of warner ( @xcite ) , which did not cover the 3.34 hr orbital period of the system , so hellier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) decided to obtain new photometry to settle the issue of whether eclipses .",
    "they concluded that is a low- inclination star not showing eclipses .",
    "curiously , the v - band light curve presented in the upper panel of their fig . 1 _ does _ show a shallow eclipse .",
    "this led dhillon ( @xcite ) to propose that is not a low - inclination system . since hellier s database only spanned two observing nights , we decided to undertake a new photometric study of with the aim of giving a definite answer to the eclipsing nature of this star .",
    "the results of this study are presented in this paper .",
    "the photometric data were obtained with the 1-m optical ground station ( ogs ) and the 0.82-m iac80 telescopes at the observatorio del teide on tenerife , and with the 1-m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma . the system was observed on one night in october 1995 with the jkt and for a total of 17 nights in the period august 1998february 1999 with the ogs and the iac80 telescopes . the observations on both telescopes on tenerife were made using ccd cameras equipped with thomson 1024@xmath61024-pixel@xmath7 chips , whilst the jkt data were obtained with a tek 1024@xmath61024-pixel@xmath7 chip .",
    "a detailed observing log is given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "all the data were acquired through a kron - cousins r - filter and the time resolution was always better than 90 s.    @xmath8    the individual images were bias - corrected and then flat - fielded in the standard way . all the data reduction was undertaken with the iraf package .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then found by performing aperture photometry on the individual images .",
    "the seeing during    all the observing runs was estimated to be always better than 1.5 , even reaching sub - arcsecond values on a couple of nights . from the scatter in the comparison star light curves we estimate that the differential photometry is accurate to @xmath11 per cent .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we present four r - band light curves of . from the light",
    "curves it is clear that displays eclipses approximately 0.15-mag deep , in contrast with the previous results of beuermann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and hellier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . due to the shallowness of the observed eclipses",
    ", we consider that they are partial eclipses of the accretion disc ( see below ) .",
    "the duration of the eclipses is @xmath240 min .",
    "we derived the first photometric ephemeris for from 13 eclipses .",
    "the times of mid - eclipse were calculated by fitting parabolas to the bottom of the eclipses .",
    "a least squares fit to these eclipse timings yields the following ephemeris :              displays asymmetric eclipses with ingress steeper than egress .",
    "this asymmetry in eclipse shape is a common feature to all systems and is indicative of the bright spot ( penning et al .",
    "@xcite ) . only exhibits a different behaviour in its continuum light curves , with eclipse egress steeper than ingress ( thorstensen et al .",
    "eclipses in are shallower ( @xmath10.15 mag ) than in the lowest - inclination eclipsing star , ( @xmath10.5 mag , and variable ) .",
    "the eclipses are also variable in depth , a feature also observed in ( thorstensen et al .",
    "the variable depth of the eclipse in cvs is still a puzzling matter .",
    "this variability may be related to local fluctuations in the disc which is in a time - averaged steady state caused for instance by a rotating accretion curtain ( thorstensen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the mean r - band light curve of is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] after phase - binning the data into 150 bins .",
    "the light curve shows an intricate behaviour : apart from the well - defined eclipse , it exhibits a large dip in brightness centred around phase 0.75 and a post - eclipse hump centred at phase @xmath10.2 .",
    "it also displays a flat region with differential r - magnitude @xmath10.75 , which extends from phase @xmath10.25 to @xmath10.5",
    ". we will consider this flat region as the out - of - eclipse light level . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show a triple - gaussian fit to the average light curve , assuming that the light curve can be decomposed into four components : a constant out - of - eclipse intensity , a hump , a wide dip and the eclipse .",
    "we want to stress that this triple - gaussian fit is merely an aid to the eye , just included to clarify the light curve structure .",
    "the presence of the wide dip in brightness prior to eclipse added to the strong flickering present in the light curves may have prevented hellier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from detecting the eclipse in one of their v - band light curves .",
    "the intricate shape of the light curve makes an explanation of the nature of its components very difficult , but we will suggest some possibilities . due to the lack of adequate spectroscopic observations ( i.e. the spectral features of the secondary star are not detected in the optical ) , it could not be clear whether the eclipse center corresponds to inferior conjunction of the secondary star",
    ". the possibility of the eclipse being a partial eclipse of the bright spot can not be _ a priori _ ruled out , but there are evidences against it : ( i ) the eclipse is not flat - bottomed , as seen in e.g. ( zhang & robinson @xcite ) , although the observed v - shaped profile can arise from a grazing eclipse of the bright spot ; ( ii ) if our zero phase corresponds to an eclipse of the bright spot , the brightening at @xmath110.9 should correspond to a pre - eclipse orbital hump .",
    "this requires an out - of - eclipse level located at the bottom of the dip at @xmath110.75 .",
    "this intensity level should be observed during a more extended range of phases than the mean light curve shows ( i.e. the bottom of the dip is narrow ) ; ( iii ) the eclipse of the bright spot should occur after the pre - eclipse orbital hump , when the intensity is decreasing towards the out - of - eclipse level ( see again zhang & robinson @xcite ) . in the eclipse is observed when the brightness is increasing . in the light of these facts , we consider that the eclipse is more likely a partial eclipse of the disc , and is centred at inferior conjunction of the secondary .",
    "the light curve structure resembles that of other eclipsing cvs in the optical domain , like the nova - likes and ( mason et al .",
    "@xcite ) and is also similar to the x - ray light curves of some lmxbs , like ( hellier & mason @xcite ) .",
    "this similarities lead us to propose that the wide dip in brightness observed in before eclipse may be caused by a raised disc rim downstream from the bright spot ( armitage & livio @xcite ) .",
    "when it is on the line of sight between the disc centre and the observer , it obscures a significant fraction of the disc causing the observed dip .",
    "a similar dip was observed in the dwarf nova in the phase range 0.60.8 during superoutburst ( kuulkers et al .",
    "@xcite ) as well as in other high - inclination dwarf novae ( e.g. , naylor et al .",
    "@xcite , ; , mason et al .",
    "@xcite ) and other cvs like ( crdova et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ( mchardy et al .",
    "the observed dip extends nearly half of the orbital cycle , which implies that the structure causing it may extend almost halfway around the disc .",
    "the same extention is seen in ( mason et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the post - eclipse hump is the most puzzling matter",
    ". it may be due to the fact that at phase @xmath10.2 we are viewing the inner side of the raised rim , which may be reprocessing energetic radiation coming from the inner parts of the disc into visible wavelengths .",
    "the problem is that the widths of the dip and the hump are very different and there is no strong reason to expect the reprocessed radiation to originate only in a small region of the inside extended rim .",
    "the small width of this feature suggests that it may be related to the emergence of the bright spot out of the secondary , but with the current data we can conclude nothing with respect to its origin .",
    "@xmath17 is the mean phase full - width of the eclipse at half the out - of - eclipse intensity . in order to determine the orbital inclination of",
    ", we calculated @xmath17 from two different gaussian fits : ( i ) the triple - gaussian fit to the mean light curve described above and ( ii ) a single - gaussian fit to the eclipse profile after masking the rest of the light curve , with the exception of the flat region extending from phase 0.25 to 0.5 .",
    "the adopted @xmath17 was the average value of those derived from the two different fits , which is @xmath18    eliminating @xmath14 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , we can obtain an estimate of the orbital inclination of the system assuming a value of the mass ratio , @xmath19 . using the mass - period relation recently derived by smith & dhillon ( @xcite ) :      where @xmath21(h ) is the orbital period of the system expressed in hours ,",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath22 for the secondary in . assuming a mass for the compact object of @xmath23 ( the average mass of white dwarfs in cvs with orbital periods above the period gap ; smith & dhillon @xcite )",
    ", we derive a value of the mass ratio for of @xmath24 .",
    "this mass ratio corresponds to an orbital inclination of @xmath25 .",
    "taking into account the error in @xmath17 the orbital inclination ranges between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , _ if the eclipsed light source is centred on the white dwarf_.    in ( [ eq2 ] ) the parameter @xmath28 is the distance from the eclipsed light source to the center of the secondary star , whereas in ( [ eq3 ] ) it is the separation of the system .",
    "the shallowness of the eclipse in suggests that we are actually observing a partial eclipse of the disc ( i.e. the white dwarf is not eclipsed ) , so @xmath28 is not the same quantity in both eqs .",
    "and we are in fact overestimating the inclination .",
    "hence , the value derived above ( @xmath25 ) can be considered as a ( very pesimistic ) upper limit to the orbital inclination .",
    "the absolute magnitude of an steady state accretion disc is a function of many variables ( warner @xcite ) , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass accretion rate through the disc , @xmath31 is the mass of the white dwarf , @xmath32 its radius and @xmath33 is the radius of the disc . by adopting an @xmath34 relation for the primaries in cvs , the dependence on @xmath32 can be eliminated .",
    "we assume the mass of the white dwarfs in systems , @xmath31 , as a constant . on the other hand",
    ", the radius of the discs in these systems does not differ very much from one object to the others ( harrop - allin & warner @xcite ) and can be taken as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the distance ( in units of the separation of the system ) from the centre of the primary to the inner lagrangian point . @xmath36",
    "only depends on the mass ratio , @xmath19 ( see e.g. warner @xcite ) . from kepler s third law",
    "we obtain that @xmath37 and then we have @xmath38 .",
    "the eclipsing systems are confined in a short orbital period range of 3.243.95 hours .",
    "the result of entering this short period range in @xmath39 relations ( e.g. verbunt & wade @xcite ) is a nearly equal @xmath30 in the eclipsing stars , so we can assume that @xmath40 is only function of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the @xmath40 of the discs in stars must be approximately the same . as a consequence ,",
    "the eclipse depth must be a function of the orbital inclination .",
    "we have searched for values of orbital inclination and eclipse depth for all the eclipsing stars in the literature , with the aim of finding a correlation . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we present a plot of the values found , which are summarized in table   [ table3 ] .",
    "the eclipse depth for all the systems was measured from v - band light curves .",
    "the systems and are not included in the plot due to the lack of reasonable estimates of the orbital inclination .",
    "we found a clear linear correlation between orbital inclination and eclipse depth . after fitting a straight line to the data we get :      the fact that all the systems lie very well within a straight line , indicates that the statements derived above are valid , particularly , @xmath31 and @xmath40 can be taken as constants .",
    "we do not have extensive v - band photometry to measure the eclipse depth , but due to the low inclination of we can consider the eclipse depth in r - band not to be very different from that in v - band . entering the eclipse depth measured in ( @xmath43 mag ) in ( [ eq5 ] )",
    ", we obtain a value of the orbital inclination of @xmath44 .",
    "we have to note that the ordinate at the origin of the linear fit is 70 degrees , value below which eclipses are not expected to occur .",
