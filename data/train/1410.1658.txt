    "the promise of quantum computers to solve classically non - computable problems @xcite has generated the great excitement and much research activity in different areas of physics , mathematics and engineering .",
    "various physical systems have been proposed for implementation of quantum bits ( qubits ) in quantum information processing devices : trapped ions , atoms in qed cavities , magnetic molecules , etc . among many candidates , spin - based solid - state systems , such as quantum dots @xcite or spin",
    "centers in host crystals ( phosphorus donors in silicon @xcite , nv centers in diamonds @xcite ) , constitute attractive candidates for qubits : these systems are well scalable , can be fabricated and operated by the methods of modern microelectronics , and advanced spin - resonance techniques are well - suited for the efficient quantum state manipulation .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that a large number of leading research groups , both theoretical and experimental , focus their studies on developing and investigating solid - state spin - based qubits .    since the quantum computing technology has being improved and quantum computers with the nontrivial number of n qubits appear feasible in the near future ,",
    "an application of the quantum computers with n@xmath32000 has ripened @xcite .",
    "the information technologies provide very interesting challenges and an extremely wide playground in which scientists working in materials science , chemistry , physics and nano - fabrication technologies may find stimuli for novel ideas . curiously , the nanometre scale is the cluster scale .",
    "so we may wonder whether , how or simply which functional magnetic clusters can be regarded in some ways as the possible components of the solid - state electron spin qubit , which is the fundamental concept of the quantum computation .",
    "key challenges in building a quantum computer from spin qubits in physical systems are preparation of arbitrary spin states , implementation of the arbitrary qubit evolution , reading out the qubit states , overcoming of the decoherence and doing all this on a large scale ; that is , with a large number of qubits or a spin system of n - qubits ( ssnq ) with the definite spin structure . for the purposes of implementing quantum computation , the physical system can be treated as a ssnq in which the couplings between the qubits can be controlled externally .",
    "the concept of a ssnq can be related to the problem of the quantum spin structure , where the nontrivial applications may exist for computers with a limited number n of a qubits .",
    "the precise relationship between the type of the entanglement and the distribution of the coupling strengths in the ssnq can be strongly dependent on external parameters , such as applied magnetic fields and temperature . in this context",
    ", systematic studies of the relationship between the amount and nature of the entanglement and the spin structure of the ssnq has been pursued in order to identify the optimal spin structures to create specific types of the entanglements @xcite .",
    "spins are alternative complementary to charges as degrees of freedom to encode information . recent examples , like for instance the discovery and application of giant magnetoresistance in spintronics , have demonstrated the efficient use of a spins for information technologies @xcite .",
    "moreover , spins are intrinsically quantum entities and they have therefore been widely investigated in the field of the quantum - information processing .",
    "the cluster nanomagnets of a transition metal are real examples of finite spin - clusters ( 0d ) , and therefore they constitute a new benchmark for testing models of the interacting quantum objects . new physics of the cluster magnets feeds hopes of certain prospective applications , and such hopes pose the problem of understanding , improving , or predicting desirable characteristics of these materials .",
    "the magnetic transition metal nanostructures on a non - magnetic substrates have attracted recently large attention due to their novel and the unusual magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "the supported clusters experience both the reduction of the local coordination number , as in free clusters , as well as the interactions with the electronic degrees of freedom of the substrate , as in embedded clusters .",
    "the complex magnetic behavior is usually associated with the competition of the several interactions , such as interatomic exchange and bonding interactions , and in some cases the non - collinear effects , which can give rise to the several metastable states close in energy .",
    "the ground state can therefore be easily tuned by external action giving rise to the switching between different states @xcite .",
    "therefore the goal is ambitious : it is not just a matter to store information in a @xmath4-metal cluster on a non - magnetic substrate , but we may think to process information with a cluster and then to communicate information at the clusters containg from magnetic @xmath4-metal atoms on a silicon surface . among the various candidates for a solid - state qubits ,",
    "spins have been of the particular interest due to their relative robustness to decoherence compared with other degrees of freedom , such as a charge .",
    "the most coherent solid - state systems investigated so far are the spins of well isolated donors in bulk 28si , which produce coherence times ( t2 ) of up to seconds ( extrapolated ) for the electron spin and minutes for the nuclear spin , which are comparable to those of a ion trap qubits @xcite .",
    "the problem of decoherence comprises our main motivation to study the decoherence dynamics of a n  qubits system @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the coherent transition from a coherent to an incoherent dynamics can be probed by the observation of rabi oscillations between the quantum states of the a spin precessing in a static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a related problem in the context of the present study is the rabi oscillations in a ssnq .",
    "here we suggest for construction of the spin qubit the ni small clusters on a silicon surface .",
    "the stabilization of rabi oscillations and the maximum of the entanglement were discussed in this ssnq . in recent years",
    ", the entanglement has attracted the attention of a many physicists working in the area of a quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this is due to the ongoing research in the area of quantum information @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies are also important in the context of spin interactions inside structured reservoirs such as a metal cluster on a nonmagnetic surface .",
    "ni is the unique among the transition - metal adatoms , because its half - filled valence configuration ( @xmath5 ) yields strong interatomic bonding leading to magnetic frustration .",
    "we apply our method to the ni clusters deposited on a si(111 ) surface . in the present work we study the entanglement between the spin states in the spin spectrum . in our model",
    ", a spin state interacts with the spin structure of the continuum at the temperature interval 0  300 k , and the entanglement properties between the spin states in the spin structure are considered . using the global entanglement as a measure of the entanglement , we derive a pair of distributions that can be interpreted as the density of entanglement in the terms of all the eigenvalue of the spin spectrum .",
    "this distribution can be calculated in terms of the spectrum of the spin excitation of the ni@xmath6-cluster on a si ( 111)-surface . with these new measures of the entanglement we can study in detail the entanglement between the spin modes in the spin structure .",
    "the method developed here , in terms of the entanglement distributions , can also be used when considering various types of the structured reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the low - lying excited states of a magnetic system are generally described in the terms of a general spin - hamiltonian @xcite . for a magnetic system with the many spin sites ,",
    "this phenomenological hamiltonian is written as a sum of a pair - wise spin exchange interactions between adjacent spin sites in a cluster and a surface .    as the most properties depend on the unique features of the local atomic structure , the diagnostic methods to the control structural parameters , such as the distances between the atoms , with the very high precision",
    "are required . in this work x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes )",
    "spectroscopy was used both to study the adsorption geometry and to get information concerning the electronic properties of the deposited ni@xmath1 clusters @xcite .",
    "xanes spectroscopy is now a powerful tool of investigation of the atomic and electronic structure of different classes of materials in condensed state .",
    "the xanes spectroscopy has essential advantages as compared with other methods of atomic structure analysis .",
    "for example , in contrast to x - ray and neutron crystallography , xanes spectroscopy can be used for investigation of materials without long order in atoms arrangement .",
    "extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) spectroscopy also allows studying the compounds without long order , but it can give only information about the coordination numbers and interatomic distances , while xanes is very sensitive to the both small bond distances and bond angles variations .",
    "for example , xanes allows determination of the interatomic distances with 0.02 angstrom accuracy as well as the study of bonding angles with the accuracy up to several degrees .",
    "thus , on the basis of xanes analysis it is possible to determine the full 3d atomic structure of studied materials .",
    "previously , we have used the method of x - ray absorption spectroscopy for a comprehensive study of copper nanoclusters and diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the properties of nanoclusters made it possible to obtain information on how the transition from the atom or cluster to the solid state can occur . in order to extract the necessary information from the experimental xanes",
    "spectra one needs to perform theoretical analysis . in the present research",
    "the theoretical xanes spectra was simulated using feff9.0 program code @xcite .",
    "feff9.0 code is based on the real space full - multiple scattering theory .",
    "the code uses the cluster approach for xanes spectra calculations and , therefore ( in contrast to program based on the band structure calculations ) , can be applied for study of compounds without long order in atoms distributions , like clusters .",
    "the electronic structure of investigated clusters was analyzed on the basis of the density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in the adf2013 code @xcite .",
    "we are using here a quantum algorithm with the three distinct steps : the calculation of the magnetic properties for the qubit ; encoding a spin wavefunction into the qubits ( the spin structure ) ; a spin - dynamics simulating its time evolution . in order to give a theoretical description of a magnetic cluster we exploit the irreducible tensor operator technique @xcite .",
    "let us consider a spin cluster of an arbitrary topology formed from an arbitrary number of the magnetic sites , @xmath7 , with a local spins s@xmath8 , s@xmath9 , ... , s@xmath10 which , in general , can have a different values .",
    "a successive spin coupling scheme is adopted : @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the complete set of a intermediate spin quantum numbers @xmath13 , with @xmath14=1,2, ... ,n-1 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath15 of the spin - hamiltonian are given by the linear combinations of the basis states @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and the coefficients @xmath19 can be evaluated once the spin - hamiltonian of the system has been diagonalized .",
    "each term of the spin - hamiltonian can be rewritten as a combination of the irreducible tensor operators technique @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite focuses on the main physical interactions which determine the spin - hamiltonian and to rewrite them in the terms of the ito s .",
    "the exchange part of the spin - hamiltonian is introduced : @xmath20 the first term @xmath21 is the heisenberg hamiltonian , which represents the isotropic exchange interaction , @xmath22 is the biquadratic exchange hamiltonian , @xmath23 is the antisymmetric exchange hamiltonian , and @xmath24 represents the anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "conventionally , they can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27\\ ] ] @xmath28 with @xmath29 = x , y , z.    we can add to the exchange hamiltonian the term due to the axial single - ion anisotropy : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the parameters of the isotropic and anisotropic exchange iterations , @xmath33 are the coefficients of the biquadratic exchange iterations , and @xmath34=-@xmath35 is the vector of the antisymmetric exchange .",
    "the terms of the spin - hamiltonian above can be written in the terms of the ito s .    in this paper",
    ", we use the results of a first - principles calculations of the exchange parameters @xmath0 . here",
    ", we introduce the scenario @xcite to construct the parameters within the classical spin model that contains the interactions , in principle , up to an arbitrary order .",
    "our development of a non - collinear method is based on a semi - relativistic first - principle calculations of the energy in the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) within the linear combination of the atomic orbitals ( lcao ) method @xcite .",
    "we suggested a straightforward approach that allows the direction of the magnetic moment of the any atom to be fixed by using only a on - site information @xcite .",
    "thus , we can obtain a sufficiently large number of a states with the different non - collinear magnetic ordering and map them onto an effective spin model by using least - squares methods .",
    "the heisenberg and biquadratic exchange are the isotropic interactions .",
    "in fact , the corresponding hamiltonians can be described by the rank-0 tensor operators and thus these have the non zero matrix elements only with the states with the same total spin quantum number @xmath12 ( @xmath36,@xmath37=0 ) .",
    "the representative matrix can be decomposed into the blocks depending only on the value of @xmath12 and @xmath38 .",
    "the all anisotropic terms are described by the rank-2 tensor operators which have the non zero matrix elements between state with @xmath36=0,@xmath39,@xmath40 and their matrices can not be decomposed into the blocks depending only on the total spin @xmath12 in account of the @xmath12mixing between spin states with different @xmath12 .",
    "the single - ion anisotropy can be written in the terms of the rank-2 single site ito s @xcite .",
    "finally , the antisymmetric exchange term is the sum of the ito s of the rank-1 .",
    "the ito technique has been used to design the magpack software @xcite , a package to calculate the energy levels , bulk magnetic properties , and inelastic neutron scattering spectra of the high nuclearity spin clusters that allows studying efficiently properties of a nanoscopic magnets .",
    "one of the major challenges in quantum computing is to identify a system that can be scaled up to the number of the qubits needed to execute the nontrivial quantum algorithms .",
    "peter shor s algorithm @xcite for finding the prime factors of the numbers used in the public - encryption systems ( numbers that typically consist of more than a hundred digits ) would likely require a quantum computer with the several thousand qubits .",
    "depending on the error correction scheme appropriate to the particular computer , the required number could be much larger .",
    "the solid - state spin quantum computers may be more likely candidates . in this work",
    "we offer the model of the quantum computer based on studying of the spin structure of the 3d - metal ni clusters on a silicon surface . in our model",
    "the total electronic structure can be written as a sum of a non - spin - polarized charge dos @xmath41 , and the spin dos , @xmath42 , @xmath43 the first part @xmath41 is connected with a one - electron structure and can be received by any dft method . the second part @xmath42 is purely a spin structure and is defined only proceeding from the spin model of a cluster . for division in an experimental spectra of the deposits from a purely spin states and from the excitations connected with the one - electron transitions , is reasonable within uniform approach to the receive electronic structure of a cluster and then , using the one - electron data for calculation of the exchange integrals , to calculate a spin structure by the ito method within the generalized spin hamiltonian @xmath44 .",
    "we have developed the idea of spins as a degree of freedom , with which models are built @xcite .",
    "the spin magnetic moment due to the exchange interaction is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the spin structure . with the spin - hamiltonian @xmath44 result ( [ gsh ] )",
    "we can obtain the quantum mechanical expectation values : @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 with the algebra of the spin operators we can obtain the expectation values for @xmath44 : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 the spin dos @xmath57 can be done by inserting the following functions : @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    the spin dos is @xmath61      once we have the energy levels , we can evaluate a different thermodynamic properties of the system as the magnetization , the magnetic susceptibility , and the magnetic specific heat . since in",
    "further researches the anisotropic part of gsh will be only scalar , the magnetic properties of the anisotropic system do not depend on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "thus we can consider the external magnetic field @xmath62 directed along arbitrary axis @xmath63 of the cluster coordinate frame that is chosen as a spin quantization axis . in this case",
    "the energies of the system will be @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the eigenvalues of the gsh containing the magnetic exchange and the double exchange contributions ( index @xmath66 runs over the energy levels with given total spin protection @xmath67 ) .",
    "then the partition function in the presence of the external magnetic field is given by : @xmath68\\sum_{m_s}\\exp[-g_e\\beta m_s h_z / kt]\\ ] ] using this expression one can evaluate the magnetic susceptibility @xmath69 and the magnetization @xmath70 by the standart thermodinamic definitions : @xmath71 @xmath72      broadly speaking , a quantum computer is a physical system that can be initialized to some known state @xmath73 , and whose dynamics can be controlled so as to induce any unitary transformation of the state vector @xmath74 . in the standard approach ,",
    "the computational process is given by the unitary time - evolution operator @xmath75 of the state vector , and is driven by the application of the external stimuli . under the assumption of a small time step @xmath76",
    "we can expand the time evolution operator @xmath77 probably the best starting point for a analytical considerations of the dynamics of the quantum spins is the heisenberg equation of a motion @xcite @xmath78+i\\alpha[\\langle\\widehat{\\bf s}\\rangle,[\\langle\\widehat { \\bf s}\\rangle,\\widehat h_{spin}]],\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the damping parameter ( @xmath79 ) . in @xcite was demonstrated that @xmath80=\\langle\\widehat { \\bf s}\\rangle\\times\\frac{\\partial",

    "@xmath82 in order to solve this equation , as an effective magnetic field , we take the variational derivative of the energy with respect to the magnetization .",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is the free energy of the magnetic nanosystem @xmath85 with the partition function ( [ z ] ) . here",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the magnetic field .",
    "thus @xmath89 calculated by formulas ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ m ] ) .",
    "we have derived a general form of the time - dependend spin equation for a system of the spins precessing in an effective magnetic field with specifying the all interactions in gsh ( [ gsh ] ) .",
    "identifying and measuring of the entanglement in multi - spin systems presents various complications .",
    "apart from the case of a two - qubit system , where the entanglement can be identified both for a pure and a mixed state @xcite , a multi - qubit entanglement is an open problem @xcite . for the analysis that follows",
    ", we will be using the measure of the recently proposed density of entanglement .",
    "based on the residual entanglement @xcite , we present the global entanglement of a n - spin state as collective measures of a multi - particle entanglement . this measures were introduced by meyer and wallach @xcite .",
    "the meyer ",
    "wallach ( mw ) measure is written in the brennen form @xcite and we use the q - measure @xcite , which corresponds , for a cluster with n qubits , to the average purity of the reduced density matrices of each qubit : @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the reduced density matrix for @xmath14-th qubit . the problem of the entanglement between spin states in the n - spin systems become more interesting when the clusters with a spectral gap in their density of the states are considered . for quantifying the distribution of the entanglement between the individual spin eigenvalues in the spin structure of the n - spin system we use the density of the entanglement ( doe ) @xcite .",
    "the density of the entanglement @xmath92 gives the entanglement between the spin eigenvalue @xmath93 and the spin eigenvalue @xmath94 in the energy interval @xmath93 to @xmath95 .",

    "thus , the entanglement distributions can be derived from the excitation spin spectrum @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the lorentzians width .",
    "though the very nature of the entanglement is the purely quantum mechanical , we saw that it can persist for the macroscopic systems and survive even in the thermodynamical limit . in this section",
    "we discuss how it behaves at the finite temperature of the thermal entanglement .",
    "the states in the n - spin system , describing a system in the thermal equilibrium states , are determined by the generalized spin - hamiltonian and the thermal density matrix @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the partition function of the the n - spin system .",
    "the thermal entanglement is @xmath103}{(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{\\mu})^2+\\delta^2}\\times\\ ] ] @xmath104}{(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{\\lambda})^2+\\delta^2}\\ ] ]      the total density of states @xmath41 of ni@xmath1 clusters was calculated by the all - electron density functional theory ( dft ) approach implemented in the adf2013 code @xcite .",
    "the main point of the density functional theory is that the potential acting on each electron of all the other electrons in the molecule or crystal , depends only on the electron density of the ground state and its gradient .",
    "thus , we can apply the one - electron formulation of a system of n interacting electrons by introducing the appropriate local exchange - correlation potential @xmath105 , in addition to any external potentials @xmath106 and the coulomb potential of the electron cloud @xmath107 and it has the form : @xmath108 the one - electron molecular orbitals @xmath109 with the appropriate orbital energies",
    "@xmath110 define precise electronic charge density and , in principle , give access to all the properties , because they are all expressed in terms of density functional , especially energy .",
    "in addition , they allow us to represent the system as a set of independent electron orbitals . in our calculations",
    "the electronic configuration of the @xmath111 cluster was described by the polarized triple zeta ( tzp ) basis set of the slater - type orbitals .",
    "the total dos was obtained using the blyp exchange functional which is equivalent to becke ( exchange)@xcite and lee - yang - parr ( lyp correlation)@xcite . the calculations were done for the high - spin state of ni@xmath1 cluster .",
    "here we present the results of the application of our theoretical and experimental approach to study of the n - qubits from seven nickel atoms interacting with a si ( 111)-surface in the terms of numerically solvable dft - models for the exchange integrals @xmath0 and we exploit the ito technique @xcite for calculation of the spin structure of the n - qubits system . in practice , this model was applied to the nanosystem ( ni@xmath1-cluster on si ( 111)-surface ) and provides an understanding of the chemical bonding of the nickel nanoparticles with the silicon substrate .",
    "it is advantageous to have access to sufficiently accurate dft - total energies to compare the different competing spin configurations . in the most first - principles calculations of the magnetic systems only ferromagnetic or some antiferromagnetic states were considered .",
    "along with these collinear magnetic configurations , many nanomagnetic clusters show the non - collinear ground states , such as conical or spin spirals or commensurate superpositions of several spiral spin - density waves . to access such states from the first principles ,",
    "the vector - spin dft , which treats the magnetization density as a vector field ( and not as a scalar field as in the collinear dft calculations ) has to be applied @xcite .",
    "the ab initio magnetic interactions are mapped onto a certain parametric gsh model ( in the simple cases , the heisenberg - dirac - van vleck ( hdvv ) model ) , which is studied by using the parameters extracted from the microscopic evaluation @xcite .",
    "although one of the fundamental parameters is the magnetic moment of the single cluster , ab initio studies of its origin are scarce , so little is known about the cluster spin structure .",
    "one of the reasons for the lack of ab initio studies is the number of the metal ions as spin sources .",
    "the lcao methods , including the electronic and the spin interactions such as the vector - spin dft , are applicable for these clusters owing to large number of their active electrons and active spaces , and , to the quantum chemical description of the magnetic anisotropy of the nanosystems .",
