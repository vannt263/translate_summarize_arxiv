    "the phenomenon of phase - ordering kinetics has attracted considerable attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that , except in certain exceptional circumstances , a scaling regime develops at late times , in which the order - parameter morphology is time - independent up to one overall time - dependent length scale @xmath12 .",
    "this means , for example , that the equal - time pair correlation function of the order parameter , @xmath13 has the asymptotic scaling form @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "relatively little attention , however , has been devoted to the study of how the scaling regime is approached , i.e.  the form of ` corrections to scaling ' in phase - ordering kinetics .",
    "in particular , an understanding of corrections to scaling is important in interpreting experimental or simulation data , and in extracting asymptotic scaling exponents and functions .",
    "this article attempts a first systematic study of corrections to scaling .",
    "we show that there is a correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath2 associated with the deviations of the order parameter morphology from the scaling morphology , i.e.  with the fact that the initial state is not in general the scaling state .",
    "presupposing a suitable definition of @xmath12 , which will require some discussion , the leading corrections to scaling in the pair correlation function enter in the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ` scaling function ' and @xmath11 the ` correction - to - scaling function ' .",
    "there are indications that @xmath2 is , in general , a _",
    "nontrivial exponent _ of phase - ordering kinetics .",
    "although for most of the simple , exactly soluble models presented here it has the value @xmath3 , we find that it takes nontrivial values within an approximate calculation for more realistic models .",
    "the models considered are the one - dimensional ( 1d ) glauber model , the @xmath17 non - linear sigma model for @xmath6 , the 1d time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation , the ohta - jasnow - kawasaki ( ojk ) approximation @xcite for the general tdgl equation , and lastly the mazenko approximation @xcite .",
    "it is the last of these that yields non - trivial values for @xmath2 .",
    "in fact @xmath2 enters the theory in a similar way to the exponent @xmath18 , which describes the decay of the autocorrelation function and is known to be nontrivial @xcite . for the 1d tdgl equation , we find that the approach to the scaling state is much faster than for the other models : for typical initial conditions the corrections to scaling vanish exponentially fast as a function of the smallest domain size .",
    "it is important to recognize that corrections to scaling can have more than one origin . for a scalar order parameter , for example , in which the morphology is specified by the locations of the domain walls",
    ", the scaling regime requires that the domain scale @xmath12 be much larger than the width @xmath19 of the walls .",
    "therefore one expects a correction to scaling associated simply with the non - zero width of domain walls , and entering as a power of @xmath20 .",
    "this is a distinct contribution from the one considered here , which is associated with departures from the scaling morphology in the initial condition .",
    "this latter contribution will survive even in the thin wall limit described by , for example , the allen - cahn theory @xcite in which infinitely thin interfaces are driven by their local curvature . throughout this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to this thin - wall limit , or the corresponding ` hard - spin ' limit ( or non - linear sigma model ) for a vector order - parameter .",
    "this leads to useful simplifications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii deals with the 1d glauber model , and introduces some general concepts . the large-@xmath5 vector model , 1d tdgl equation , ojk theory , and mazenko theory , are covered in sections iii to vi respectively .",
    "section vii concludes with a discussion and summary .",
    "in the continuum limit , the equation of motion for the pair correlation function @xmath21 has the form @xcite @xmath22 the constraint @xmath23 can be built in through a source term at @xmath24 , i.e.  we modify the equation of motion to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is chosen to satisfy the constraint .",
    "let us define @xmath1 to be the average domain size .",
    "then for @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density of domain walls , and we have allowed for the possibility of either one or zero walls in an interval of length @xmath30 .",
    "equation ( [ smallr ] ) is then correct to order @xmath30 .",
    "integrating ( [ eom1 ] ) across an infinitesimal interval around @xmath24 , and comparing with ( [ smallr ] ) , gives @xmath31 .",
    "putting this into ( [ eom1 ] ) , and writing @xmath21 in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath1 in the form @xmath32 gives the following equation for @xmath33 : @xmath34 where dots and primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .    in the limit @xmath37",
    ", we expect @xmath33 to approach the @xmath1-independent scaling function @xmath16 .",
    "balancing powers of @xmath1 on the right of ( [ scaled ] ) then implies @xmath38 , i.e.   @xmath39 .",
    "including the leading correction to scaling , of relative order @xmath40 , we write @xmath41 in ( [ scaled ] ) , and equate terms of leading ( @xmath42 ) and next - to - leading ( @xmath43 ) order .",
    "this gives @xmath44    integrating ( [ f_0 ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath45 , @xmath46 [ from ( [ smallr ] ) ] gives ( for @xmath47 ) @xmath48 equation ( [ f_1 ] ) for @xmath49 becomes @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "writing @xmath52 gives @xmath53    what are the boundary conditions on @xmath54 ?",
    "clearly @xmath55 , because @xmath23 is already implemented by @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , the condition @xmath57 , from ( [ smallr ] ) , is already guaranteed by @xmath58 , so @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , ( [ g ] ) then gives @xmath60 , implying that the series expansion for @xmath54 starts at @xmath61 .",
    "inserting the series solution @xmath62 gives @xmath63 , and the recurrence relation @xmath64g_n$ ] for the higher - order odd coefficients , all even coefficients vanishing . in order that @xmath11 decrease faster than a power - law for large-@xmath36 , as required on physical grounds for initial conditions with only short - range correlations , the series expansion for @xmath54 must terminate .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath65 .",
    "we conclude that the leading correction - to - scaling exponent for the 1-d glauber model is @xmath66 with corresponding correction - to - scaling function @xmath67",
    "it is convenient to work with spins of fixed length , i.e.  with the nonlinear sigma model , to avoid additional ( uninteresting ) corrections to scaling associated with the gradual saturation in the length of the spins as the coarsening proceeds .",
    "the non - conserved dynamics of the @xmath17 non - linear sigma model is described by the equation @xcite @xmath68 corresponding to the equation @xmath69 , with free energy @xmath70 , subject to the constraint @xmath71 ^ 2 = 1 $ ] .    in the limit",
    "@xmath72 we can replace @xmath73 by its mean in the usual way @xcite . let us call this mean @xmath74 . in the scaling regime , dimensional analysis gives @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a constant .",
    "the energy density is just @xmath77 .",
    "it is , in fact , convenient to _ define _ @xmath12 through this relation for all times @xmath35 ( in the same spirit as the 1d glauber model ) . then multiplying ( [ phi ] ) by @xmath78 and averaging over initial conditions",
    "gives the equation @xmath79 for the pair correlation function @xmath21 .",
    "in analogy to our treatment of the 1d glauber model we write @xmath80 .",
    "then ( [ c ] ) becomes the following equation for @xmath33 : @xmath81 inserting the forms ( [ l ] ) and ( [ f ] ) ( taking @xmath82 without loss of generality ) , and equating coefficients of the terms in @xmath42 and @xmath83 as before gives @xmath84    consider first @xmath85 .",
    "the two linearly independent solutions have large-@xmath36 behavior @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the power - law term must be absent for a physical solution corresponding to an initial condition with only short - range correlations . setting @xmath88 in ( [ fn_0 ] ) gives @xmath89g_0 ' + ( \\lambda/2 - d/4)g_0=0 $ ] .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( the latter being required by the differential equation , to avoid a singularity at @xmath92 ) . to retain the gaussian tail in @xmath85 , the series solution for @xmath93 must terminate .",
    "this fixes @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , with a corresponding set of polynomial solutions for @xmath93 , the first two of which are @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "an explicit solution of @xmath98 for a general initial condition shows that these different scaling solutions are selected by the small-@xmath99 behavior of the structure factor , @xmath100 [ the fourier transform of @xmath101 , at @xmath102 .",

    "the series must terminate , just as in the one - dimensional glauber model .",
    "this requires @xmath119 . for each such @xmath2 , there is a corresponding correction - to - scaling function . the generic case , corresponding to short - range correlations in the initial condition , is the smallest value of @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath3 , with @xmath120 .",
    "the correction - to - scaling function is then @xmath121    the value of @xmath2 for the @xmath6 limit , @xmath3 , is thus identical to that of the @xmath122 glauber model , raising the question of whether this could be a general result for models with non - conserved dynamics .",
    "indeed , the ohta - jasnow - kawasaki theory discussed in section v gives the same result .",
    "the related approach of mazenko ( section vi ) , however , gives a different , and indeed nontrivial , result . in the following section , we discuss another model with @xmath123",
    "another exactly soluble model ( in a suitable limit ) is the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( or tdgl ) equation in one dimension .",
    "this reads @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the order - parameter field and @xmath126 is a potential function , with a symmetric double - well structure . for convenience",

    ", this equation can be reduced to the standard model of curvature - driven growth @xcite , whereby the domain walls move with a velocity proportional to their local curvature . in one dimension , of course , the domain walls are points , and domain coarsening is driven by the exponentially weak forces between adjacent walls , mediated by the exponential tails of the domain - wall profiles .    for the case of interest , where the typical domain size @xmath1 is large compared to the width @xmath19 of a wall , the closest pair of domain walls annihilate while the remaining walls hardly move at all , leading to the following simplified model @xcite .",
    "the smallest domain is combined with its two neighbors to form a new single domain .",

    "eventually the system reaches a scaling state in which the distribution @xmath131 of domain sizes @xmath132 , when the smallest domain size is @xmath133 , has the scaling form @xmath134 .",
    "an important feature of this process is that if the domain sizes are initially uncorrelated they remain uncorrelated , because the merging of three domains into a single domain introduces no correlations @xcite .",
