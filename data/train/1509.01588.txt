    "the question of what stellar system produce the different types of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) is still open .",
    "while it is accepted that hydrogen - rich ( type ii - plateau ) sne arise from relatively low - mass stars in the red supergiant phase @xcite , the nature of hydrogen - deficient ( types ib and ic ) sne progenitors remains unclear @xcite .",
    "one crucial aspect is understanding what mechanisms are at play for envelope removal . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to focus the attention on the intermediate group of type iib sne ( sne  iib ) whose spectra evolve from hydrogen rich to hydrogen poor and which has been suggested to originate from stars that lost most of their h - rich envelopes .",
    "proposed mass - loss mechanisms are those of strong stellar winds or interaction in close binary systems .",
    "the former mechanism requires a very large mass of the sn progenitor , possibly with a wolf - rayet ( wr ) or luminous blue variable ( lbv ) nature .",
    "remarkably , the firmest identifications of sn - iib progenitors in pre - explosion images  i.e .",
    ", those of sne  1993j and 2011dh  have been associated to moderate - mass supergiants of spectral types f to k @xcite , hotter than the progenitors of type ii - plateau sne .",
    "moreover , they were suggested to have formed close binary systems by the possible detection of their companion stars @xcite .",
    "sne  2008ax and 2013df are the other two sne  iib with possible progenitor identifications in pre - explosion imaging .",
    "the case of sn  2008ax is revised in this work using newly available data . for sn  2013df",
    ", the candidate is again a cool , k - type supergiant star @xcite .",
    "these cases appear to indicate a prevailing close binary origin for sne  iib .",
    "however , @xcite found signatures of a wr - type wind in very ealy spectra of the sn  iib 2013cu .",
    "the sn  iib 2008ax has been an important case of study due to its small distance and the availability of pre - explosion _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging and extensive multi - wavelength followup .",
    "@xcite studied the pre - sn images and found a source at the sn location that was possibly the progenitor . with the then available data , the authors selected two out of a series of possible scenarios : a wr star that retained a small amount of hydrogen , or an interacting binary system . the light curves and spectra indicated a relatively low ejected mass and normal kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the low mass was generally interpreted as an indication against a single massive wr progenitor . however , by including rotation in the evolutionary models of massive stars @xcite found a suitable progenitor born with 20 @xmath0 and ending with the correct core mass , hydrogen content , luminosity and color to explain the complete set of observations .",
    "@xcite reinterpreted the final stage of the rotating model as a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star and suggested that lbvs may be the progenitors of some core - collapse sne .    one intriguing aspect of sne  iib is the possible relation between progenitor radius ( or h - envelope mass ) and circumstellar medium ( csm ) density . if the progenitor star can be detected in pre - sn observations , a radius can be determined .",
    "alternatively , the shape of the uv - optical light curve during the first few days after explosion can also indicate the extent of the exploding star depending on the strength of the cooling emission from the shocked envelope @xcite",
    ". the csm can be probed through radio and x - ray observations and this can be linked to the mass - loss history of the progenitor .",
    "when a dense csm is present shock - heated gas can also produce optical emission at late times , typically evident in box - like emission lines in the spectra and a slow - down of the light curve as compared to the usual radioactive - power decline rate .",
    "these phenomena were observed in the sne  iib 1993j @xcite and 2013df @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that radio properties of core - collapse sne provide information about the size of the progenitor and proposed that sne  iib were divided into those with compact ( wr - like ) and extended ( supergiant ) progenitors .",
    "sn  2008ax was placed in the compact category while sn  1993j belonged to the extended one .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that such a connection breaks down for sn  2011dh . nonetheless , by restricting to the three sne  iib with direct progenitor detections and estimates of the csm density ( sne  1993j , 2011dh , and 2013df )",
    ", @xcite suggest that sne with more extended progenitors may have denser surrounding media , possibly due to a larger mass - loss rate near the time of explosion .",
    "the range of radii goes from @xmath2200 @xmath1 in sn  2011dh to @xmath2600 @xmath1 in sne  1993j and 2013df .",
    "there is a wide variety of sne - iib light curves observed during the first few days after explosion , which may indicate a range of progenitor radii .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the relation suggested by @xcite holds in general , and if it represents a continuum of progenitor properties or two distinct groups . adding more objects to the csm density ",
    "progenitor radius diagram is thus of critical importance to understand the evolutionary paths and mass - loss history of massive stars .    since the work by @xcite , new _",
    "hst _ imaging of the field of sn  2008ax was obtained with longer exposure times and better spatial resolution than the pre - explosion ones .",

    "the location of the sn on the @xmath5 images is shown in figure  [ fig : reg ] and corresponds to pixels @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 $ ] , and @xmath54 $ ] in the wfpc2 image , the 2011 wcf3 image and the 2013 wfc3 image , respectively .",
    "we confirm the identification of the pre - sn object detected by @xcite in the wfpc2 images .",
    "but the late - time wfc3 images reveal critical information previously unavailable about the possible sn progenitor .    the first thing that strikes the eye from figure  [ fig : reg ]",
    "is that the object detected by @xcite is in fact resolved into four sources in the 2011 image .",
    "the source to the se matches the location of the sn to within @xmath21@xmath55 .",
    "we identify this source with the fading sn . indeed ,",
    "the 2013 images show that this source has disappeared within the noise .",
    "we indicate the other three sources with letters a , b , and c. the object identified by @xcite as the progenitor candidate is thus contaminated by the light from objects a , b , and c.    figure  [ fig : hstim ] shows the complete set of images used in this work .",
    "the identification of sources a , b , and c can be done in the rest of the wfc3 images from 2011 and 2013 , except for the bluest bands where the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath56 ) is too low .",
    "we performed point - spread function ( psf ) photometry of the pre - sn source present in the wfpc2 images , and of the four sources identified in the wfc3 images .",
    "when the objects were not detected , we estimated limiting magnitudes as explained below .",
    "the pre - explosion wfpc2 images were measured with the daophot package included in iraf .",
    "we employed the combined frames except in the @xmath4 band which showed poor alignment of the individual exposures . in that band",
    "we measured psf photometry on the two images and averaged the results .",
    "the resulting photometry is listed in table  [ tab : prph ] ( second row ) , compared with that obtained by @xcite on the same images ( first row ) .",
    "the values are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we obtain a larger uncertainty in the @xmath4 band , probably due to a larger inconsistency between the two individual exposures .",
    "we thus confirm that the magnitude in this band is about @xmath57 mag brighter than what was originally reported by @xcite who may have used the misaligned image from the hla .",
    "no object was detected at the sn location in the wfpc2/@xmath8 image ( figure  [ fig : hstim ] ) .",
    "we thus estimated a limiting magnitude from the pixel statistics in the region of the pc chip around the sn site .",
    "following @xcite , we defined the limiting magnitude for @xmath58 as that of an object with peak pixel value of three times the standard deviation of the background ( @xmath59 counts s@xmath7 ) . due to the lack of point sources in the pc chip , we could not compute a suitable psf that would allow us to convert the detection threshold to a magnitude .",
    "instead , we used the encircled energy fractions tabulated by @xcite for apertures of different radii . from table  2(a ) in @xcite , the fraction of flux in a radius of 1 pixel versus 120 pixels is @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the @xmath62 and @xmath11 bands , respectively , with a typical uncertainty of @xmath63 .",
    "we assumed an average was valid for @xmath8 , and thus the limiting flux was @xmath64 counts s@xmath7 . using the flux calibration of wfpc2 ( table  5.1 in",
    "* ) the limiting vega - system magnitude corresponding to that flux is @xmath65 . with @xmath66 and @xmath67 mag ,",
    "this is @xmath68 mag .",
    "this value is similar to that of @xmath69 mag obtained by @xcite    on the wfc3 images we used the dolphot v2.0 package @xcite .",
    "dolphot provides a magnitude from each exposure .",
    "we only considered those measurements where the object was detected in all frames .",
    "in those cases , the final magnitude was obtained as a weighted average of the individual measurements . in other cases",
    "we estimated a limiting magnitude based on the local pixel statistics .",
    "the detection limit was set as three times the background standard deviation , and this value was converted into a limiting magnitude in the vega system using the psf computed for the image . the resulting magnitudes and limits are listed in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "the photometry of objects a , b , and c remains stable within the uncertainties between 2011 and 2013 , while the object identified as the sn in 2011 is no longer detected in 2013 .",
    "the limits at this latter epoch indicate that the sn became , as expected , fainter with time .",
    "objects a , b , and c are separated from the sn by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , respectively , as measured in the f814w image . at the distance of ngc  4490 , these correspond to projected separations of @xmath73 pc , @xmath74 pc , and @xmath74 pc .",
    "their profiles are compatible with being point sources , although the image resolution with full width at half - maximum of @xmath75 corresponds to a projected diameter of @xmath23 pc .",
    "their relative brightness and separation from the sn site make them blend into one source in the wfpc2 images ( see figure  [ fig : reg ] ) . as already indicated by @xcite ,",
    "the size of the source in the wfpc2 images is actually compatible with it holding more than one star .",

    "however , this model no longer fits the pre - sn photometry , as shown in figure  [ fig : sedfit ]",
    ".    a better fit to the revised pre - sn photometry in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands is achieved using the rotating model with 28 @xmath0 from @xcite . however , the uv emission is too bright to comply with the upper limit in the @xmath8 band ( see figure  [ fig : sedfit ] ) .",
    "another problem of the model is the low h abundance at the final stage : the progenitor would be a wn star that would produce a type ib sn .",
    "a further complication is the final progenitor mass being @xmath109 @xmath0 , which too large to explain the light - curve timescale ( section  [ sec : hyd ] ) .",
    "a possibly better solution could be that of the non - rotating 25-@xmath0 model , which according to @xcite leads to a final configuration that is compatible with a sn - iib event .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : sedfit ] ( green squares ) , the model is slightly underluminous in all bands . if , however , the distance is assumed to be shorter within the uncertainty the fit to the observed pre - sn photometry can be improved . as mentioned before",
    ", the final mass of the model of @xmath110 @xmath0 poses a problem when one considers the shape of the sn light curve .",
    "a different scenario that appears to be recurrent among stripped - envelope sne and sne  iib in particular is an interacting binary progenitor . in this case",
    ", the primary ( donor ) star explodes after transferring most of its h - rich envelope to the secondary ( accreting ) star . as a consequence ,",
    "the secondary may remain after the explosion .",
    "the detection limits from 2013 place constraints on the brightness of any putative left - over companion star .",

    "we provide support for a binary progenitor based on the mass of the pre - sn object obtained from hydrodynamical modelling of the sn light curve and expansion velocities .",
    "in section  [ sec : bin ] we present a possible binary system computed with our stellar evolution code that accounts for the pre - sn properties along with complying with constraints from observations of the sn itself .",
    "a set of explosion models were calculated in order to derive the possible physical parameters of sn  2008ax . for this purpose",
    "we used a one - dimensional lagrangian lte hydrodynamical code @xcite applied to stellar evolution pre - sn structures @xcite with different he core masses .",
    "the methodology is the same that we applied in previous analyses of sne  iib ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. we first derived global parameters focusing on the explosion of h - free structures to fit the main peak of the bolometric light curve and the expansion velocities , and then we used such parameters to analyze the effect on the early light curve of a thin h - rich envelope with different extensions . in order to compare models and observations on the same time frame",
    ", we adopted an explosion date of @xmath111 from @xcite .",
    "the bolometric light curve was derived using the color - based bolometric corrections provided by @xcite .",
    "we adopted this approach over integrating the flux in the observed bands to obtain a more homogeneous result at all epochs independently of the wavelength coverage .",
    "the bolometric corrections take into account contributions from the uv and ir ranges that can be significant depending on the sn color .",
    "we employed the @xmath112 and @xmath113 light curves published by @xcite augmented by @xmath112 observations of @xcite .",
    "bolometric corrections were derived using the calibrations for @xmath27 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath34 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "the colors above were corrected by milky - way and host - galaxy reddening as derived in section  [ sec : dist ] .",
    "observed magnitudes were corrected for extinction and the resulting bolometric magnitudes were transformed to luminosities using the distance to ngc  4490 also given in section  [ sec : dist ] .",
    "for each color a different result was obtained , thus yielding seven bolometric light curves .",
    "these were finally combined by interpolating each light curve to the epochs of the others and averaging the results .    in order to approximate the photospheric velocities calculated by our models , we adopted line expansion velocities derived from doppler shifts of the  @xmath235876 and  @xmath235169 absorptions .",
    "@xmath235876 velocities were taken from @xcite and @xcite , while  @xmath235169 velocities were obtained from the latter work . roughly after day 10 since explosion  @xmath235876 velocities began to flatten as the photosphere receded beyond the bottom of the he - rich layer . at such late times  @xmath235169",
    "presumably provides a closer approximation of the photospheric velocity . at early times",
    ", the  @xmath235169 velocity has a flat behavior that may be due to contamination from other lines as the lines are rather weak .",
    "we thus adopted the velocities at @xmath119 days and the velocities afterward .    in the first stage of the modeling we derive the ejected mass , explosion energy and radioactive nickel production by fitting the overall shape of the bolometric light curve and expansion velocity evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : hydmass ] shows the observations compared with four models of different progenitor masses : ( 1 ) model he3 with he core mass of @xmath120 @xmath0 , explosion energy of @xmath121 erg , and @xmath122ni mass of @xmath123 @xmath0 , ( 2 ) model he4 with he core mass of 4 @xmath0 , explosion energy of @xmath124 erg , and @xmath122ni mass of @xmath63 @xmath0 , ( 3 ) model he5 with he core mass of 5 @xmath0 , explosion energy of @xmath125 erg , and @xmath122ni mass of @xmath30 @xmath0 , and ( 4 ) model he6 with he core mass of 6 @xmath0 , explosion energy of @xmath126 erg , and @xmath122ni mass of @xmath123 @xmath0 .",
    "we consider that models he3 ,",
    "he4 , and he5 give a fair representation of the observations judging all the uncertainties involved , whereas model he6 provides an overall worse fit to the light curve shape and velocity evolution .",
    "the range of validity of the model parameters is roughly given by the three former solutions . note that models he4 and he5 provide a better fit on the rising part of the bolometric light curve than model he3 , but the latter gives a better match to the main peak and subsequent decline . while he5 produces a slightly overestimation of the tail luminosity , he4 has a lower peak and slightly wider light curve than what was observed . on the other hand",
    ", he3 gives the best approximation to the late - time photospheric velocity evolution as traced by the  @xmath235169 line . even if models he4 and he5 provide higher photospheric velocities than the observed ones we consider that they are acceptable given the uncertainties involved",
    "contrarily , model he6 departs from the observations in an unsolvable manner .",
    "its light curve is too and wide , the initial rise is not well - reproduced , and the late - time velocities are too large .",
    "if the energy were lowered to improve the match to the velocities , the resulting light curve would be even wider and the initial luminosity evolution would be even lower .",
    "this analysis suggests that the progenitor of sn  2008ax had a he core mass of @xmath127 @xmath0 . in order to have this low he core mass ,",
    "the progenitor necessarily had a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass below 25 @xmath0 , thus favoring a binary origin .",
    "our conclusions are consistent with previous results based on analytical modeling @xcite .",
    "early photometry obtained within a few days from explosion can serve to reveal the progenitor structure and in particular , the extent of its h - rich envelope ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during this phase ,",
    "before radioactivity begins to dominate , the light curve is regulated by the physical conditions of the shock - heated ejecta .",
    "this in turn leads to an initial luminosity decline usually referred to as the `` cooling phase '' .",
    "the more extended the progenitor structure , the higher the luminosity and temperature of the emitting region right after shock breakout , and the slower the subsequent decline .",
    "the effect on temperature makes the cooling phase more noticeable in the blue bands than in the red ones .",
    "interestingly , sn  2008ax was observed in the uv range by the _ swift _ satellite soon after the explosion @xcite .",
    "swift_/uvot data in the uv bands showed an initial decline lasting for at least four days after explosion .",
    "this decline was not observed in the optical range , although a slower initial rise may be seen in the _ swift _ @xmath128 band @xcite and in the @xmath129 band @xcite .",
    "these observations are reminiscent of a post shock cooling phase .",
    "we thus investigated whether the early light curves provided information about the progenitor extent based on our hydrodynamical modelling .",
    "we considered our h - free he5 initial stellar structure , which has a radius of @xmath130 @xmath1 , and modified it by adding thin h - rich envelopes of different extent to @xmath131 , 50 , and 100 @xmath1 and masses of @xmath132@xmath133 @xmath0 . with these initial structures we computed the hydrodynamics using the same explosion parameters as in the model shown in figure  [ fig : hydmass ] .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : hydrad ] shows the comparison of the resulting bolometric light curves with the observations at early times .",
    "clearly , as the radius increases the initial decline becomes more evident .",
    "after about five days since explosion , all the models converge as the light curve becomes regulated by @xmath122ni radioactivity .",
    "the comparison suggests that progenitor radii up to about 30 @xmath1 are allowed .",
    "a caveat should be made about the accuracy of the bolometric luminosity at the earliest times when a significant fraction of the flux is expected to be emitted in the uv range . according to @xcite ,",
    "the observed colors of sn  2008ax indicate that the fraction of the total flux included in the _ swift _ uv range is well below 10% at all epochs . and even if the bolometric corrections from @xcite can account for this contribution ( see their section 5.1 ) , any extra flux at shorter wavelengths may have been missed .",
    "this is why in the following we decided to directly compare our models with light curves in individual",
    "_ swift_/uvot bands .",
    "for that purpose we assumed a black body emission to convert the modeled bolometric light curves into broad - band light curves .",
    "this is a simple assumption , although at early times it may provide a valid approximation as the ejecta are sufficiently dense .",
    "we constrained our analysis to the @xmath134-band data since it showed the most clear initial decline .",
    "bluer uv bands showed only upper limits at this early stage .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : hydrad ] shows the comparison of our extended he5 models with the @xmath134-band light curve .",
    "absolute magnitudes were obtained from the observations by assuming a distance modulus and extinction as derived in section  [ sec : dist ] ( i.e. , @xmath134-band extinction of @xmath135 mag ) .",
    "although the models fail to exactly reproduce the low luminosity at @xmath136 days , presumably due to the black - body approximation , we can qualitatively see that the more extended the progenitor the larger the initial decline and the later the light - curve minimum occurs .",
    "also the extended models produce a smaller contrast between the minimum and the subsequent maximum of the light curve .",
    "the apparent duration and depth of the observed minimum would indicate that the most favored models are those between 30 and 50 @xmath1 .",
    "we performed a similar analysis based on the he3 and he4 models and found a worse comparison with the observations .",
    "in particular , as the core mass decreases , the @xmath134-band light curve becomes more luminous .",
    "this is a consequence of the increased temperatures reached by the ejecta due to the shock wave propagation .",
    "although the approximations involved may prevent a definitive conclusion to be driven , the overall trends of the @xmath134-band analysis seem to indicate that the mass of the progenitor was between 4 and 5 @xmath0 and its radius was between 30 and 50 @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the location of the pre - sn object in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ; see section  [ sec : bin ] ) indicates an extended structure for the progenitor of @xmath137 @xmath1 .",
    "we now consider whether the results from the previous sections can be interpreted in the frame of the theory of binary stellar evolution .",
    "for this purpose we computed several models with the aim of accounting for the pre - supernova photometry and , simultaneously , the observed light curve of sn  2008ax .",
    "a successful model should produce a progenitor with a final mass of @xmath138 to reproduce the sn light curve , and a small amount of hydrogen in the outermost layers to satisfy the sn classification as type  iib .",
    "we employed the code described in @xcite , updated to consider the case of massive binaries as presented in @xcite .",
    "our stellar code handles the mass transfer process in a fully implicit way .",
    "we considered models with solar chemical composition and ignored the effects of rotation .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that the companion star is able to retain a fraction @xmath139 of the material transferred by the primary ( the one that explodes ) .",
    "@xmath139 is kept fixed throughout the entire evolution of the pair .",
    "we ended the calculations at oxygen exhaustion .",
    "since the remainder of the primary evolution occurs during a very short time scale and only affecting its core , it is safe to assume that the stars do not significantly move any further in the hrd .",
    "we explored the parameters of the problem  the masses of the components and the initial orbital period , @xmath140based on our study of sn  2011dh @xcite . in comparison , for sn",
    "2008ax we found slightly larger initial masses and a much shorter @xmath140 .",
    "the observations of sn  2008ax are fulfilled with a pair of 18@xmath141 + 12@xmath141 on an orbit with @xmath142 days , while for sn  2011dh we proposed a pair with 16@xmath141 + 10@xmath141 and @xmath143 days .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hrd ] we show the resulting evolutionary track for the case of @xmath144 . shortly after the end of the core hydrogen burning stage ,",
    "the primary star undergoes roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , i.e. , a class b mass transfer episode .",
    "the main mass transfer episode starts at an age of @xmath145 myr and lasts for only 26 kyr .",
    "the star detaches from its roche lobe with a mass of @xmath146 @xmath141 ; thus , the mean mass transfer rate is of @xmath147 @xmath141 yr@xmath7 while the maximum value is of @xmath148 @xmath141 yr@xmath7 .",
    "core helium burning starts soon after the end of the rlof , and most of it is burned during the large blue loop in the hrd .",
    "when central helium is exhausted the star begins to swell again , evolving to lower effective temperature conditions .",
    "then , the primary star begins to burn carbon and quickly undergoes the second rlof that lasts up to explosion .",
    "the companion star reacts to accretion by swelling appreciably , but it does not fill its own roche lobe at any moment ; therefore , the binary never reaches a contact configuration and thus avoids suffering a common - envelope episode .    the primary explodes at an age of @xmath149 myr . at these conditions , the pre - sn has a mass of @xmath150 @xmath141 and a radius of @xmath151 @xmath152 .",
    "most of its radius is occupied by the outer hydrogen rich layer ( outward of @xmath153 @xmath152 ) containing only @xmath30 @xmath141 .",
    "the total amount hydrogen in the outer layer is of @xmath154 @xmath141 . at that moment , the companion has a mass of @xmath155 @xmath141 with a luminosity and effective temperature very similar to those corresponding to a 20 @xmath141 star on the zero age main sequence ( zams , see figure  [ fig : hrd ] ) ; so , it is somewhat overluminous .",
    "the parameters chosen for the binary system satisfy the effective temperatures and luminosities for both stars just before the explosion , and also a primary structure capable of accounting the light curve and classification of sn  2008ax .",
    "however , we should remark that this is not a unique solution because the parameters are degenerate .",
    "for example , we may have chosen a higher initial mass for the companion and a lower value of @xmath139 to reach a similar final mass . in any case",
    ", it seems virtually impossible to find a final mass of the primary of 45 @xmath0suitable to account for the observed light curve  if the initial primary mass is modified by more than about @xmath156 @xmath141 .",
    "the results presented in this section allow us to state that binary stellar evolution is able to provide a successful progenitor scenario to explain the main characteristics of sn  2008ax .",
    "sn  2008ax has been one of the best - studied sne  iib to date . along with extensive , multi - wavelength follow - up observations , the existence of deep pre - explosion _ hst _ images placed this object among a selected group of sne  iib for which a progenitor could be characterized , as first done by @xcite . since then",
    ", additional observations of the sn site were obtained with even higher resolution using the wfc3 camera on board _",
    "hst_. the new images allowed us to revisit the progenitor candidate and to discover that it was in fact a multiple source .",
    "after subtracting the light from three nearby stars , the revised progenitor photometry resulted significantly fainter and bluer than what was measured on the pre - explosion images .",
    "moreover , the new images showed a fading source coincident with the sn location and demonstrated that most of the light from the pre - sn source had disappeared .",
    "this observation unambiguously showed the correct identification of the exploding star .",
    "sn  2008ax is thus the third sn  iib , after sne  1993j and 2011dh , with a firm progenitor detection .    comparing the revised photometry with stellar atmosphere models",
    ", we found that the progenitor , if single , was compatible with a b to mid - a type supergiant star .",
    "contrarily , pre - sn models of wr and lbv stars calculated by @xcite , some of which had been proposed for sn  2008ax based on the contaminated photometry , are not compatible with the new photometry .",
    "detection limits from the 2013 images allow for a relatively faint source to be left at the sn site .",
    "we estimated that any such remaining object could be as luminous as an o9b0 main - sequence star .    using hydrodynamical models to reproduce the bolometric light curve and photospheric velocity evolution we arrived at the conclusion that the exploding object had a relatively low mass of 45 @xmath0 , similarly to what had been concluded based on other techniques . from a comparison with the early light curves , especially those in the uv range , we additionally concluded that the progenitor must have had a relatively extended structure , with a low - density h - rich envelope reaching about 3040 @xmath1 .",
    "such a low mass and extended radius disfavor a massive progenitor that loses the outer envelope via stellar winds and ends its life as a wr or lbv star .",
    "we note that even if the favored progenitor appears as a blue supergiant star , resembling those of sn  1987a - like events , the stellar structure is substantially different in the case of sn  2008ax , with a much lower - mass , extended h - rich envelope .",
    "the difference in h mass is what explains the dissimilar light curve shape and spectroscopic properties between the sn  iib 2008ax and the sn  1987a - like objects .",
    "a viable alternative is that of an interacting binary system . in this case , the progenitor is allowed to be less massive and the envelope is lost through mass transfer to the companion star .",
    "we were able to provide such a binary model using our stellar evolution code .",
    "the model assumed a pair of 18@xmath0 + 12@xmath0 in a close orbit ( with initial period of 5 days ) that naturally explained the explosion of a nearly h - free , @xmath24 @xmath0 star of @xmath157 @xmath1 with a remaining main - sequence companion that complied with the latest detection limits .",
    "the solution is not unique but it demonstrates that the scenario is plausible .",
    "a definitive confirmation and characterization of the proposed binary progenitor would require a deep search for the companion star in future observations from space .",
    "the case of sn  2008ax sheds light on the origin of sne  iib , which has implications for the progenitors of core - collapse sne in general . to date",
    "there are three sne  iib with identified progenitors , namely sne  1993j , 2008ax , 2011dh , and one candidate for sn  2013df .",
    "remarkably , in all of these cases the progenitors have been suggested to belong to binary systems . for sne  1993j and",
    "2011dh there is further evidence of the presence of a hot companion star @xcite .",
    "this fact points to a possible common origin for sne  iib .",
    "the history of mass loss for sn - iib progenitors is a crucial aspect to understand their nature . from radio and x - ray observations and by studying the late - time optical spectra and light curves , evidence of substantial amounts of csm has been found for sne  1993j and 2013df .",
    "contrarily , sne  2008ax and 2011dh appear to have occurred in much `` cleaner '' environments .",
    "such differences may indicate a different mass - loss history . in the interacting binary scenario , this may in turn be linked with the strength and timing of the mass - transfer episodes and with the ability of the accreting star to retain the material .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the cases with denser csm correspond to more extended progenitors , of over 500 @xmath1 . with a progenitor radius of only @xmath240 @xmath1 as derived from our models , sn  2008ax would agree with the same picture .",
    "more objects are necessary to confirm if this is a general rule for sne  iib and whether the progenitor radius and csm density follow a continuum of properties or if they group into two distinct classes .",
    "finally , the physical reason for such a possible distinction is yet to be known and would require detailed modeling of the progenitor evolution .",

    "<S> _ hubble space telescope _ observations of the site of the supernova ( sn )  2008ax obtained in 2011 and 2013 reveal that the possible progenitor object detected in pre - explosion images was in fact multiple . </S>",
    "<S> four point sources are resolved in the new , higher - resolution images . </S>",
    "<S> we identify one of the sources with the fading sn . </S>",
    "<S> the other three objects are consistent with single supergiant stars . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that their light contaminated the previously identified progenitor candidate . </S>",
    "<S> after subtraction of these stars , the progenitor appears to be significantly fainter and bluer than previously measured . </S>",
    "<S> post - explosion photometry at the sn location indicates that the progenitor object has disappeared . </S>",
    "<S> if single , the progenitor is compatible with a supergiant star of b to mid - a spectral type , while a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star would be too luminous in the ultraviolet to account for the observations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our hydrodynamical modelling shows the pre - explosion mass was 45 @xmath0 and the radius was 3050 @xmath1 , which is incompatible with a wr progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> we present a possible interacting binary progenitor computed with our evolutionary models that reproduces all the observational evidence . a companion star as luminous as an o9-b0 main - sequence star may have remained after the explosion . </S>"
