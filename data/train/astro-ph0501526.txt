    "the metric @xcite used by carmeli in a generally covariant theory ( cosmological general relativity ) extends the number of dimensions of the universe by the addition of a new dimension  the radial velocity of the galaxies in the hubble flow .",
    "the hubble law is assumed as a fundamental axiom for the universe and the galaxies are distributed accordingly .    in determining the large scale structure of the universe",
    "the usual time dimension is neglected as observations are taken over such a short time period compared to the motion of the galaxies in the expansion . in this case , the usual time coordinate ( @xmath3 ) does not need to be considered .",
    "this leaves only four dimensions to be considered ",
    "three of space and one of velocity . in general",
    ", however , the new 5d cosmology developed by carmeli contains all of general relativity as a subset .",
    "all of the results in general relativity that are experimentally supported are also obtained in cosmological general relativity ( cgr ) @xcite .    when discussing the motions of stars and gases in galaxies the five dimensional cosmology must be used . both the usual geodesic equation and a new phase space equation",
    "have been derived using cgr . from this carmeli was able to derive a tully - fisher like equation @xcite , which indicates that the existence of halo dark matter is not necessary to be assumed in spiral galaxies .",
    "it is then worth seeing to what extent the carmeli cosmological theory fits the observed data .",
    "this paper fits the theory to the observed magnitude - redshift data taken from the high - redshift type ia supernovae observation teams . from this analysis on the largest scales of the universe no dark matter",
    "is necessary when the carmeli model is assumed .      here",
    "the cgr theory is considered using a riemannian four - dimensional presentation of gravitation in which the coordinates are those of hubble , i.e. distance and velocity , or more precisely , proper distances as measured by the hubble law and the measured redshifts of galaxies .",
    "this results in a phase space equation where the observables are redshift and distance .",
    "the latter may be determined from the high - redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations .      in the case considered here",
    "the line element is @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 alone and comoving co - ordinates @xmath10 are used .",
    "the new dimension ( @xmath8 ) is the radial velocity of the galaxies in the expanding universe , and is not the time derivative of the distance .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 , the hubble - carmeli time constant , is a constant for all observers at the same epoch and its reciprocal ( designated @xmath12 ) is the hubble ` constant ' measured in the limit of zero gravity and zero redshift , which is only approximately the hubble constant @xmath13",
    ".    equation ( [ eqn : metric ] ) then represents a curved _ spacevelocity _ which , like in general relativity , may be represented by a four - dimensional riemannian manifold with a metric @xmath14 and a line element @xmath15 .",
    "this differs from general relativity in that here the @xmath16 coordinate is velocity - like instead of time - like as is the case of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the speed of light and a universal constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is the time coordinate . in this theory @xmath19 , where @xmath11 is also a universal constant .",
    "the other three coordinates @xmath20 , are space - like , as in general relativity .",
    "the line element represents a spherically symmetric isotropic but not necessarily homogeneous universe .",
    "the observations are made at a definite time and therefore @xmath21 does not appear in ( [ eqn : metric ] ) .      in cgr , as in general relativity , one equates geometry to physics . in this theory einstein s field equations",
    "@xmath22 are modified .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath23 ) takes on a different physical meaning .",
    "the coupling constant ( @xmath24 ) that relates the geometry @xmath25 in ( [ eqn : fieldeqn ] ) to the energy terms @xmath23 is also different .",
    "however the form of ( [ eqn : fieldeqn ] ) is exactly the same as in general relativity , but with @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "therefore @xmath29 .    the correspondence with general relativity is easily seen by the substitutions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in this new theory the energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 is constructed with these substitutions . as usual @xmath33 , where where @xmath34 is the average mass / energy density of the universe and @xmath35 is the four - velocity .    in general relativity @xmath36 . in newtonian gravity the potential function",
    "is defined by the poisson equation @xmath37 . where @xmath38 the vacuum",
    "einstein field equations are usually solved in general relativity and similarly laplace s equation in the newtonian theory .",
    "these are valid solutions but in cosmology there never exists the situation where the density @xmath34 is zero because the universe always contains matter and energy .",
    "so in order to equate the rhs of ( [ eqn : fieldeqn ] ) to zero carmeli took @xmath39 but @xmath40 , in the appropriate units .",
    "here @xmath41 is the critical or `` closure '' density and in this model @xmath42 .",
    "therefore in cgr @xmath43 .",
    "the result is that we can view the universe , in _",
    "spacevelocity _ , or phase space as being stress free when the matter density of the universe is equal to the critical density .",
    "that is , the effective density @xmath44 .",
    "this then gives us the analogous situation to that in the newtonian and einsteinian theories .",
    "besides the assumption of the universality of the hubble law , this is the second fundamental assumption in this cosmology .      in _ spacevelocity _ the null condition @xmath45 describes the expansion of the universe . in the limit of no matter or gravity",
    "( i.e. @xmath46 ) the null condition yields @xmath47 , which when integrated with appropriate initial conditions results in @xmath48 in an expanding universe .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath49 , the hubble law in the zero - gravity limit .",
    "it follows from ( [ eqn : metric ] ) for a spherically symmetric isotropic distribution of matter where spherical spatial coordinates ( @xmath50 ) are used and taking into account @xmath51 ( the isotropy condition ) that @xmath52 which results in @xmath53 the positive sign is chosen for an expanding universe , which was solved in @xcite .",
    "carmeli found a solution to the resulting field equations @xcite , with the necessary condition that @xmath54 , as @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an arbirary function of @xmath9 and satisfies @xmath58 .",
    "the solution is where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the matter density @xmath61 is assumed to be the smoothed average density for matter that is evenly distributed throughout the universe .",
    "however because we look back through past epochs the density is a function of the redshift @xmath0 .    by substituting ( [ eqn :",
    "soln1field2 ] ) with ( [ eqn : fvalue1 ] ) into ( [ eqn:4dmetricderiv ] ) we get carmeli s result @xmath62 where the positive solution has been chosen for an expanding universe .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : phasespacederiv ] ) may be integrated exactly to get @xmath63 thus ( [ eqn : phasespacesoln ] ) may be written in terms of normalized or natural units @xmath64 and for arbitrary @xmath65 , @xmath66 considering the expansion of the universe it is clear that ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) describes a tri - phase expansion . initially the universe is very dense and @xmath67 so the hyperbolic sine function becomes a normal trignometric sine function describing a decelerating expansion . then the density @xmath61 reaches unity and the rhs of ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) becomes equal to @xmath0 which describes a coasting stage .",
    "finally the density decreases and @xmath68 as the universe continues to expand .",
    "then the hyperbolic sine function represents an exponentially accelerating universe .",
    "there are four symbols used in this paper for density expressed as a fraction of the critical density .",
    "the symbol @xmath61 represents the matter density at any epoch defined by redshift @xmath0 and because we take @xmath21 , @xmath61 is therefore only a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the symbol @xmath69 represents the matter density at the present epoch and therefore is a constant on the time scale of any measurements used here .",
    "the symbol @xmath70 specifically represents the baryonic matter density at the present epoch , which in this paper we show is identical with @xmath69 .",
    "the symbol @xmath71 is the vacuum or ` dark ' energy contribution to gravity and is a function of redshift @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , because the cosmological constant ( @xmath72 ) does not appear explicitly in carmeli s cosmology this latter component is really a property of the metric .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section [ sec : density ] discusses the variation of matter density with redshift and presents an equation , modified by the author @xcite from the carmeli equation , that describes proper distance as a function of redshift in the carmeli cosmology .",
    "section [ sec : comparison ] is where the new work begins . in this section , for the first time , a magnitude - redshift relation is fitted to the data taken from the high-@xmath0 supernovae teams @xcite , for a model that assumes flat _",
    "spacevelocity_. in section [ sec : density2 ] a magnitude - redshift relation is fitted to the same data but this time for a model that assumes curved _",
    "spacevelocity_. section [ sec : hubble ] calculates the value of @xmath73 .",
    "section [ sec : darkenergy ] calculates the value of @xmath71 and the total @xmath74 as a function of redshift .",
    "the appendix calculates , in a more rigorous way than in section [ sec : density2 ] , the effect of curved _ spacevelocity _ on matter density as a function of redshift .",
    "now let us consider the density of matter as a function of redshift , @xmath0 .",
    "carmeli assumed that the value of @xmath61 in ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) is fixed and plotted curves as functions of redshift for various values of @xmath61 .",
    "see figure a4 , on page 134 of @xcite .    in 1996",
    "he predicted that the universe must be accelerating @xcite and simulated the form of the high redshift data of riess _ et al _ @xcite , published in 1998 , which announced an accelerating universe following the observations of garnavich _ et al _ @xcite and perlmutter _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "therefore in 1998 , carmeli assumed a value of total matter ( normal bayonic matter + dark matter ) density @xmath75 , which was the accepted value then for @xmath69 the matter density at the present epoch .",
    "however , more correctly @xmath61 varies as a function of redshift , @xmath0 .",
    "carmeli never fitted his theory to any of the high redshift sne data with a least squares method or any other , nor did he determine a value for the matter density @xmath69 himself .      the density of normal baryonic matter in the universe has generally come from considerations of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn)@xcite . the predicted primordial abundance of the light elements are assumed to have been produced in the big bang and not in stars .",
    "hence a comparison between predicted abundances and abundances inferred from observed baryon - to - photon ratios are used to put an upper limit on the baryon density .",
    "deuterium is believed to be only destroyed by stellar processing , therefore any observation of its interstellar or solar system abundance would put a lower bound on its primordial abundance since it is believed that it was all created in the bbn process . as a result",
    "a lower bound on deuterium translates into an upper bound on the density of baryons . following this line of logic",
    "the observed interstellar value of @xmath76 puts a limit on the baryon density @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "an earlier determination produced @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath70 is the baryonic density expressed as a fraction of the critical density and @xmath12 is the hubble constant as a fraction of @xmath79 and not to be confused with @xmath73 used in this paper . ) assuming a value of the hubble parameter @xmath80 these two sources put @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "the aforementioned values of @xmath70 agree well with the locally measured baryonic budget .",
    "one study yields a range @xmath83 at @xmath84 with a best guess of @xmath85 where a hubble constant of @xmath86 was assumed @xcite .",
    "now , determinations of the total matter density ( including dark matter ) , at high redshifts , have been made , for example , from x - ray measurements of the gas content in galaxy clusters combined with the total virial masses @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the virial masses in turn assumes that the equations describing the motions of the constituents in the clusters are correct and therefore gravitational potentials are assumed that generate masses larger than the baryonic matter content .",
    "hence a significant dark matter content results .",
    "however it is well - known that mass - to - light ratios vary over all mass scales from galaxies to superclusters @xcite .",
    "this may be the result of an incorrect understanding of the physics which has resulted in incorrect dynamical masses .",
    "that conclusion is suggested by carmeli s derivation of a tully - fisher type relation for galaxies @xcite and by a new post - newtonian equation describing the dynamics of the stars and gases in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the latter produces the galaxy rotation curves , without any dark matter , where previously it was necessary to assume that they are evidence for halo dark matter .",
    "therefore the application of the carmeli theory to the very important problem of galaxy cluster dynamics is necessary to see if it also eliminates dark matter on that scale .",
    "eventually it is necessary that the carmeli theory also determine cluster masses from the virial theorem , observed x - ray temperatures , and from weak gravitational lensing with results consistent with each method and with the observed baryonic matter density .",
    "however such an exercise is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the question that remains for this paper to answer is `` do the high-@xmath0 sne ia data fit this model without the need to assume the existence of dark matter ? '' in future research , other issues can be addressed , for example , to explain the much higher than expected dynamical masses of clusters at high redshift , and the shape of the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background as well as the acoustic peaks in its spatial spectrum .",
    "this paper makes no determinations about the matter density , dark , baryonic or otherwise at high redshift except the following , with a justification in section [ sec : darkenergy ] .",
    "@xmath87 where @xmath69 is then the averaged matter density , at the present epoch , expressed as a fraction of the critical or `` closure '' density .",
    "@xmath69 can be considered to be constant on the time scale of any measurements used here .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) results from the fact that as the redshift increases the volume changes as @xmath88 assuming flat euclidean space .    in the standard friedmann - lemaitre ( f - l )",
    "theory the equivalent expression is @xmath89 where @xmath90 the scale factor ( because at the present epoch , as usual , @xmath91 is assumed to be unity ) and @xmath92 is the hubble term which quantifies the curvature of the expansion and defined @xmath93 , where the dot is the time derivative .    in this theory the curvature results from the inclusion of the new velocity dimension and the implicit assumption of the universality of the hubble law .",
    "this introduces curvature through the concept of _ spacevelocity _ , which is discussed later .",
    "( see section [ sec : density2 ] and the appendix .",
    "the time derivative of a scale factor is not relevant . )    in the first instance i assume a flat _ spacevelocity _ model in ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) , which is identical to ( [ eqn : stdmodeldensityeqn ] ) where @xmath94 .",
    "this would correspond to a dust dominated spatially flat universe in the standard theory .    now",
    "the value of the baryonic matter density commonly cited is @xmath95 . if this is assumed to be the total matter density then @xmath96 in ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) .    substituting ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) into ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) we get @xmath97    it has been shown @xcite that ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) with @xmath75 ( which carmeli initially assumed ) and ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) with @xmath98 are practically identical over the redshift range @xmath99 .",
    "the difference between the two equations over the domain of the measurements is much less significant than the fit to the data .    once it is shown that this theory fits the actual observational data it follows that this effectively eliminates the need for the existence of dark matter on the cosmic scale",
    "in order to compare ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) with the data from the high redshift sne ia teams the proper distance is converted to magnitude as follows .",
    "@xmath100 where @xmath101 is the `` hubble constant free '' luminosity distance .",
    "@xmath101 is related by @xmath102 using ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) and @xmath103    here @xmath104 incorporates the various parameters that are independent of the redshift , @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath105 is the absolute magnitude of the supernova at the peak of its light - curve and the parameter @xmath91 allows for any uncompensated extinction or offset in the mean of absolute magnitudes or an arbitrary zero point .",
    "the absolute magnitude then acts as a `` standard candle '' from which the luminosity and hence distance can be estimated .",
    "the value of @xmath105 need not be known , neither any other component in @xmath104 , as @xmath104 has the effect of merely shifting the fit curve ( [ eqn : magnitude ] ) along the vertical magnitude axis .    by choosing the value of @xmath106 , which is the reciprocal of the chosen value of the hubble constant in the gravity free limit @xmath107 ( see section [ sec : hubble ] ) @xmath108 . in practice , where the distance modulus ( @xmath109 ) is used in the curve fits , @xmath91 is an arbitrary free parameter .",
    "it has been one of the goals of cosmology to determine if the hubble expansion is speed limited .",
    "that is , to answer the question of whether the cosmological expansion is governed by the relativistic doppler effect or not . if it is nt then in ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) @xmath110 ( as written ) , but if it is then as @xmath8 approaches @xmath18 it is necessary to replace @xmath0 in ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) with @xmath111 .",
    "so by fitting to the data of the high-@xmath0 sne ia it is possible to test this experimentally .",
    "behar and carmeli @xcite have asserted that latter ( speed - limited version ) is the correct form , so this then becomes an experimental test of the prediction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( [ eqn : lumindistance ] ) has been plotted against the distance modulus ( @xmath109 ) data taken from table 5 of riess _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",

    "this immediately answers the question .",
    "the hubble expansion , as seen from our position as observer , is speed - limited , by the usual relativistic doppler effect , which confirms the theoretical prediction .",
    "it can be seen that curve 2 departs from curve 1 slightly above redshift , @xmath112 .",
    "both curves have been plotted with a value of @xmath113 , which is the best fit for curve 1 .",
    "however different ` best fit ' offsets ( @xmath91 ) have resulted . for curve 1 , @xmath114 and for curve 2 , @xmath115 .",
    "there are a total of @xmath116 data and the residual for the speed - limited version of ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) is @xmath117 , with @xmath118 and hence @xmath119 .",
    "the residual for the non - speed - limited version of ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) is @xmath120 , with @xmath121 and hence @xmath122 .    in order to make curve 2 pass through the highest data points",
    "the requirement on the mass density is @xmath123 , which is unphysical assuming only baryonic matter . as mentioned in section [ sec : density ] , the local baryonic matter budget has been measured in the range @xmath83 @xcite with a best guess of @xmath85 .",
    "the latter is consistent with the best fit from this data set .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis , @xmath124 i.e. no dark matter needs to be included .",
    "also only the speed - limited form of ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnaturald ] ) will be used .",

    "the 5d brane world of moshe carmeli has been has been applied to the accelerating expanding universe and the magnitude - redshift distance relation has been applied to the distance modulus data from the type ia sne measurements . it has been found that considering only the evolution of baryonic matter density as a function of redshift , the resulting distance - redshift relation fits the data of the high-@xmath0 supernova teams without the need for any dark matter .",
    "astronomers and cosmologists have wondered whether the expansion of the universe is speed - limited in the usual doppler sense . here",
    "it has also been shown that the expansion is , in fact , speed - limited .",
    "this means that even though the galaxies are assumed fixed within the expanding space , energy can not be transported faster than the speed of light in vacuum , i.e. photons arriving at an earth detector are relativistically doppler redshifted .",
    "considering the range set on the present epoch baryonic matter density of @xmath83 @xcite with a best guess of @xmath85 and the fact that necessarily @xmath215 , the best estimates of the matter density ( which is only baryonic ) from this analysis are @xmath216 with the flat _ spacevelocity _ model .",
    "a similar result was obtained fitting a curved _ spacevelocity _ model .",
    "even though the statistically derived standard errors are large , it is only necessary that @xmath69 be within the range of the locally measured baryonic matter density for the theory to fit the data .",
    "therefore dark matter can play no part in carmeli s description of the large scale structure of the universe .    even though it does not explicitly appear in carmeli s _ spacevelocity _ metric , the vacuum energy contribution to gravity @xmath71 is a property of the metric and tends to unity as a function of decreasing redshift .",
    "this indicates that the universe , although always open because @xmath217 , is asymptotically expanding towards a spatially flat state , with a value of @xmath2 at the present epoch .",
    "this appendix deals with a more rigorous approach to the effect that curved _ spacevelocity _ has on matter density as a function of redshift .",
    "however this approach results in a transcendental equation , which could not be used in analytical curve - fitting .",
    "nevertheless the analysis here validates the methods used in sections [ sec : comparison ] , [ sec : density2 ] .      in a flat _ spacevelocity _ where @xmath138 and @xmath157 it follows from ( [ eqn:4dmetricderivrz ] ) that @xmath220 . now using ( [ eqn:4dmetricderivrz ] ) , in general , @xmath221 which when substituting @xmath158 from ( [ eqn : soln1field2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : fvalue1 ] ) becomes , @xmath222    finally by substituting @xmath223 , which is the hubble law to the lowest order in @xmath0 in the limit of no gravity , we arrive at an expression which is integrable and describes the matter density in the presence of curved _",
    "spacevelocity_. @xmath224    from ( [ eqn : domegarcurved3 ] ) it is clear we recover ( [ eqn : domega ] ) when @xmath138 .",
    "so all that needs to be done is integrate ( [ eqn : domegarcurved3 ] ) to get @xmath61 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "but it is not simply solved .",
    "it appears difficult to separate @xmath61 in the integrand on the right - hand side from @xmath0 . so assuming that in ( [ eqn : domegarcurved3 ] ) the value of @xmath61 is approximately constant or only slowly changing as a function of @xmath0 we integrate and impose the boundary conditions that when @xmath138 and @xmath225 then @xmath226 . to satisfy both conditions in ( [ eqn : domega ] ) the limits of integration must be from @xmath227 to @xmath0 .",
    "that is @xmath228 this results in        in the limit where @xmath232 , @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath233 where @xmath234 .",
    "it is expected that the mass density can alway be approximated to yield euclidean space locally . from the former ,",
    "the boundary conditions are almost met and hence the approximation is reasonably valid .    the solution to ( [ eqn : domegarcurvedfinal ] )",
    "is not analytical and must be solved numerically .",
    "the form of the transendental equation does not lend itself to curve fitting as has been done in sections [ sec : comparison ] , [ sec : density2 ] .",
    "however , using the software package mathematica , it is possible to create a function that is the solution to such an equation as ( [ eqn : domegarcurvedfinal ] ) .",
    "this was done and compared with the flat _ spacevelocity _ model .",
    "the result is almost identical to ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) for redshift @xmath235 , that is , when @xmath166 in the flat _ spacevelocity _ model , @xmath236 in the resulting curved _ spacevelocity _ model .",
    "see figure [ fig : figa1 ] where the density @xmath61 has been plotted for both models up to @xmath205 .",
    "this then means the matter density @xmath237 in the curved _ spacevelocity _ model has approximately the same functional dependence on redshift @xmath0 used in the main text .",
    "therefore we are justified in using the flat _ spacevelocity _ model or the approximate curved _ spacevelocity _ model . only where @xmath238 does the curve derived from ( [ eqn : domegarcurvedfinal ] ) depart from the flat space model of ( [ eqn : densityeqn ] ) .",
    "also for @xmath239 the assumption , that @xmath61 be at most a slowly changing function , breaks down and thus the integration in ( [ eqn : domegarcurved4 ] ) is invalid .    at these higher redshifts the unapproximated form of ( [ eqn : domegarcurved2 ] )",
    "must be solved where @xmath163 is substituted from ( [ eqn : phasespacesolnnatural ] ) and @xmath240 .",
