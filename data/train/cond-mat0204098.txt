    "although only specific cases are simulated , a reasonable hypothesis emerges as to the question of how low is a low enough temperature before the low - noise results are valid .",
    "the hypothesis is that it depends on how close the applied field is to a value where the low - temperature prefactor has a discontinuity or a divergence . as the field where the low - temperature prefactor has a discontinuity or divergence",

    "he found that with appropriate assumptions the dynamic for the classical ising model consisted of randomly choosing a spin and flipping it with a probability given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( with boltzmann s constant set to unity ) , @xmath27 is the energy of the configuration with the chosen spin flipped and @xmath28 is the energy of the original spin configuration . here",

    "here we concentrate on a one - dimensional phonon bath , but results for phonon baths in other dimensions have also been obtained @xcite . again",
    "the assumption is made that the correlation times in the heat bath are much shorter than the the times of interest in the spin system , and then the integration over all degrees of freedom of the heat bath is performed . in this case the dynamic is given by randomly choosing a spin , and by using a flip probability given by @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and zero if @xmath36 . in eq .",
    "( [ eqpflipp ] ) the attempt frequency @xmath37 must be chosen so as to make all probabilities less than one .",
    "for the fields and temperatures simulated here , this is accomplished by choosing @xmath38 .",
    "we are most interested in measuring the lifetime of a metastable state for the ising model .",
    "we start with all spins up ( @xmath39 ) , and apply a static field of strength @xmath5 directed opposite to the spins ( directed downward ) .",
    "the total magnetization for the model is @xmath40 , so the magnetization starts at @xmath41 .",
    "we measure the time @xmath42 required for the magnetization to reach @xmath43 , since for this magnetization one has crossed the saddle point and is rapidly moving toward the equilibrium magnetization .",
    "the units for @xmath42 used are monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , where one mcs corresponds to one attempted spin flip .",
    "the physical time is proportional to the time in units of monte carlo steps per spin .",
    "however , the low - temperature limit relevant here is the single - droplet regime @xcite ( where a single nucleating droplet causes escape from the metastable state ) .",
    "consequently , we will use mcs as our units of @xmath42 . in the present work the measurement for @xmath42 is repeated for @xmath44 escapes using different random number sequences , and",

    "the average lifetime in the single - droplet regime has the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the prefactor and @xmath48 is the energy of the nucleating droplet .",

    "this dynamic can not be changed without changing the physics .",
    "it can be implemented in a straightforward way on serial computers .",
    "however , the average lifetimes can be extremely long at low temperatures , making simulation in the straightforward manner unfeasible .",
    "although the dynamic can not be changed , the dynamic can be implemented on the computer in a more efficient fashion .",
    "one way of doing this is to use a rejection - free technique , by which only moves that are successful are implemented , and the time to make such a successful move is added to the current time . for discrete models , such as the ising model , this method is called the @xmath14-fold way , and was implemented in continuous time by bortz , kalos , and lebowitz in 1975 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14-fold way method can also be implemented in discrete time @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14-fold way method can lead to exponential speed - ups in the algorithm .",
    "unfortunately , particularly at small field values , the @xmath14-fold way exponential speedup is not sufficient to allow low - temperature ising simulations to progress in a reasonable amount of computer time .",
    "however , the discrete - time version of the @xmath14-fold way can be further accelerated by realizing that the @xmath14-fold way algorithm uses a @xmath56 absorbing markov matrix to decide what will be the next spin configuration and to decide the time to exit from the current spin configuration .",
    "this monte carlo with absorbing markov chain method ( the mcamc method ) can naturally be generalized to the case of using @xmath57 absorbing markov chains @xcite .",
    "the details of the mcamc method as well as the projective dynamics method , both of which are used here , can be found in a recent review @xcite . for the simulations here , we have used @xmath58 , 2 , and 4 in the absorbing markov chains in the mcamc method . for any @xmath59 the average lifetime ,",
    "@xmath45 , and all other averages are the same as for the straightforward implementation of the dynamics .",
    "this is because by using the mcamc algorithm the dynamic has not been changed , the dynamic has just been implemented on the computer in a more intelligent fashion .",
    "at very low temperatures ( in the low - noise limit ) the kinetic ising model lifetimes are influenced by the discreteness of the lattice .",
    "this has allowed for exact calculation of the saddle point as well as the most probable route to the saddle point .",
