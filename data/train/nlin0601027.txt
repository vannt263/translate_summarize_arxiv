    "suspensions of dust , impurities , droplets , bubbles , and other finite - size particles advected by incompressible turbulent flows are commonly encountered in many natural phenomena and industrial processes .",
    "these finite - size particles , whose density may differ from that of the underlying fluid , can not be modeled as point - like tracers because of their inertia .",
    "often , they are characterized by the presence of strong inhomogeneities in their spatial distribution .",
    "indeed , light ( heavy ) particles tend to concentrate into specific regions of the flow characterized by high ( low ) values of the vorticity .",
    "such a phenomenon is dubbed ` preferential concentration ' @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities then appearing in the particle spatial distribution are important because they affect the probability to find close particle pairs and thus influence their possibility to collide , or to have biological and chemical interactions .",
    "examples showing the importance of this phenomenon are the formation of rain drops by coalescence in warm clouds @xcite , or the coexistence between several species of plankton in the hydrosphere @xcite .",
    "engineering applications encompass optimization of spray combustion in diesel engines @xcite and in rocket propellers @xcite .",
    "inertial particles are also important for the problem of dispersion of dust , chemicals or aerosols in the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "recently , much effort have been devoted to the study of phenomena related to preferential concentration of inertial particles in turbulent flows by means of both theoretical @xcite and computational @xcite approaches .",
    "progresses in the characterization of the statistical features of particle clusters have been achieved by studying inertial particles evolving in laminar stochastic flows @xcite and two dimensional turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "experimental results are reviewed in ref .",
    "recently , experiments  @xcite have been also realized borrowing techniques from lagrangian turbulence  @xcite .",
    "considerable less attention has been paid to other aspects of inertial particle dynamics , and in particular to the statistical properties of their acceleration in turbulent flows .",
    "this is an important issue relevant , for example , to the development of stochastic models of particle motion @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to contrast the statistics of the acceleration of inertial particles with that of fluid tracers which has been extensively studied by means of experiments @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite and theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "this is even more interesting on the light of recent experiments @xcite designed to study inertial particles in turbulent flows by means of lagrangian measurements .",
    "concerning fluid tracers , it has been found that the acceleration probability density function ( pdf ) displays the typical fat tails of highly intermittent signals @xcite .",
    "the tails of the pdf have been associated to trapping events into vortex filaments @xcite .",
    "moreover , a model based on the multifractal description of turbulence has been proved able to describe the pdf of the acceleration tracers @xcite .",
    "similar questions are still open for inertial particles .",
    "because of the centrifugal force acting on such particles , inertia is expected to considerably change the statistics of trapping events into vortex filaments .",
    "it is important to quantify this effect by looking at the modification of the pdf tails as a function of the degree of inertia .",
    "moreover , it is not known how to generalize the multifractal approach used for passive tracers to the case of passive particles with inertia .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the statistical properties of particles much heavier than the carrier fluid .",
    "we are interested in investigating , by means of high - resolution direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , the combined effects of preferential concentration and of inertia in determining the statistics of acceleration . with this aim ,",
    "we review and extend the results presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we perform a systematic study as a function of the stokes number .",
    "here stokes is defined as @xmath4 , being @xmath5 the typical response time of the particle and @xmath6 the kolmogorov time of the flow . + most results concern monodisperse suspensions , i.e. set of particles with a unique stokes number .",
    "since laboratory and natural suspensions are typically polydisperse , we shall extend our analysis to this case also .",
    "+ understanding the relevant time scales to reach a stationary regime is important both for experimental studies  often limited in running time  and for a dynamical description of preferential concentration .",
    "we present an analysis of the _ transient regime _ ,",
    "i.e. the time window necessary for the particles to reach a statistically steady regime , starting from their initial configuration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hdyn ] , we recall the equations of motion for the case of inertial particles much heavier than the surrounding fluid . a detailed description of the numerical set up is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] the validity of the model equations for our numerical experiments is considered .",
    "moreover , we discuss the statistical features of preferential concentration both during the _ transient _ and in the statistically stationary regime .",
    "the most relevant features of particle acceleration statistics for monodisperse suspensions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : accel ] .",
    "section  [ sec : poly ] is devoted to extend the previous analysis to polydisperse cases .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "the equations of motion of a small , rigid , spherical particle immersed in an incompressible flow have been consistently derived from first principles in refs .",
    "@xcite under a certain number of assumptions .",
    "the main working hypothesis is to consider low particle concentration , so that it is possible to neglect collisions , particle - to - particle hydrodynamic interactions and the feedback of particles on the carrier fluid .",
    "another hypothesis is that the particle radius @xmath7 is much smaller than any active scale of the turbulent flow , namely that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the kolmogorov dissipative scale .",
    "finally , the particle reynolds number @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the typical relative velocity of the particle with the flow and @xmath12 is the fluid kinematic viscosity , has to be small , i.e.  @xmath13 .",
    "these hypotheses lead to describe the fluid flow surrounding the particle as a stokes flow and to write a close differential equation for the motion of the particle @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a single particle then depends on only two dimension - less parameters .",
    "the first is @xmath14 , accounting for the mass density ratio between the particle , @xmath15 , and the fluid , @xmath16 .",
    "the second control parameter is the stokes number @xmath17 , where the particle response time is @xmath18 .",
    "further , neglecting gravity , and assuming that the particle is much heavier than the fluid , the particle velocity @xmath19 is to leading order a solution to  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the particle position , @xmath22 the fluid velocity field , and @xmath23 is the fluid acceleration at the particle position . as long as @xmath24 does not become too large ( see sect . [ subsec : validity ] ) , the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ eq:0 ] ) can be neglected when @xmath25 , so that the equations can be further simplified to @xmath26    it is interesting to compare the evolution equations for particles ( [ eq:1 ] ) with that for the motion of fluid tracers @xmath27 which corresponds to the limit @xmath28 of ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "tracers may be seen as @xmath2 particles .",
    "the carrier fluid is evolved according to the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pressure field and @xmath31 is the external energy source , @xmath32 .",
    "these are solved on a cubic grid with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "energy is injected by keeping constant the spectral content of the two smallest wavenumber shells  @xcite .",
    "the viscosity is chosen so to have a well resolved dissipative range , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the grid spacing .",
    "we use a fully dealiased pseudospectral algorithm with 2@xmath35 order adam - bashforth time stepping .",
    "we performed three sets of runs at resolution @xmath36 with @xmath37 , the corresponding reynolds numbers are @xmath38 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "particle dynamics , eqn .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , is integrated in parallel with that of the fluid by means of a 2@xmath35 order adam - bashforth time - stepping , in which the fluid velocity at particle position is estimated by linear interpolation .    for each set of runs ,",
    "the following procedure has been adopted .",
    "we integrate the navier - stokes equations until the flow reaches a statistically steady state .",
    "once a turbulent configuration for the flow is obtained , millions of particles and tracers are seeded in the flow .",
    "their initial positions are uniformly distributed in the volume , and velocities are chosen equal to the local fluid velocity .",
    "equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) for particles and ( [ eq : tracer ] ) for tracers are then advanced in parallel with those for the fluid ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "we consider particles with @xmath39 different stokes numbers ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ( see caption of table  [ table:1 ] for the exact values ) , and a set of tracers , @xmath2 .",
    "for each set of particles with a given stokes number , we save the position and the velocity of @xmath42 particles every @xmath43 , with a maximum number of recorded trajectories of @xmath44 for the highest resolution . along these trajectories",
    "we also store the velocity of the carrier fluid . at a lower frequency ,",
    "@xmath45 , we save the position and velocity of a larger number @xmath46 of particles ( up to @xmath47 per @xmath48 , at the highest resolution ) together with the eulerian velocity field .",
    "a summary of the physical parameters for the run at the highest resolution , the one discussed in this paper , is given in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : fit ]",
    "direct numerical simulations , even at moderate reynolds number , represent a valuable tool for the study of the lagrangian motion of heavy particles .",
    "here we have described the specific set up of our numerical study , analyzed the importance of preferential concentration and particle clustering as a function of the stokes number . moreover , we have explored the transient dynamics which precedes the settling of the particle motion onto a statistically steady state in terms of the particle distribution",
    ". this may be particularly important for real observations and laboratory experiments , where long time records of particle motion are hardly attainable .",
    "we have also reviewed and extended some recent results about the acceleration pdf of inertial particles , at varying the importance of inertia .",
    "the main conclusions are ( i ) preferential concentration plays an _ almost singular _ role at small stokes , since even a small inertia is sufficient to expel particles from vortical regions where the strongest acceleration fluctuations are experienced ; ( ii ) for small stokes , a good quantitative agreement between the inertial particle acceleration and the conditioned fluid tracer acceleration is obtained ; ( iii ) at large stokes , the main effects is filtering of the velocity induced by the response stokes times . + the formulation of a phenomenological model able to describe the inertial particle acceleration as a function of both stokes and reynolds numbers is still beyond our reach . an easy fitting procedure has however been proposed for polydisperse suspensions , the most common experimental situation . for polydisperse cases ,",
    "we show that the simple approach of characterizing the suspension in terms of its average stokes number without taking into account the stokes number distribution can give a systematic bias , particularly if the particle distribution is skewed towards small stokes values .",
    "it would be extremely important to test the proposed approach with experimental data .",
    "finally it would be interesting to numerically investigate @xmath49 particles to get a better understanding of the almost singular behavior that has been observed for the acceleration .",
