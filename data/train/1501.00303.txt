    "techniques capable of reliably quantifying the _ in vivo _ forces experienced by single - molecules ( without ensemble averaging ) offer the potential to gain new molecular - level understanding of various complex biological processes including cell division @xcite , virus assembly @xcite , endocytosis @xcite and drug delivery @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we demonstrate how the hierarchical dirichlet process switching linear dynamical system ( hdp - slds ) framework developed by fox and co - workers @xcite can be used to deduce the direction and magnitude of different forces that contribute to molecular motion in living cells @xcite .",
    "the utility of combining the hdp - slds with spt was motivated by experiments aiming to quantify the time varying forces driving chromosome dynamics .",
    "the approach presented shows promise in both ( i ) accelerating the scientific discovery process ( i.e. , statistically significant changes in dynamics can be reliably detected ) and ( ii ) automating preprocessing tasks required when analyzing and segmenting large spt data sets .",
    "the technique introduced is applicable to various scenarios where spt trajectories are sampled frequently in time and particles can be accurately tracked over multiple frames , e.g. @xcite .",
    "extracting accurate and reliable force estimates from noisy position vs.  time data in the aforementioned setting requires one to account for numerous complications inherent to experimental spt data in living cells .",
    "for example , nonlinear and/or time changing systematic forces need to be differentiated from thermal fluctuations ( i.e. , random forces ) , both of which contribute to motion at the length and time scales measurable in living systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , additional measurement noise ( consisting of localization error amongst other factors @xcite ) induced by the optical measurement apparatus must be systematically accounted for since this noise source varies substantially between and within single trajectories ; inaccurate effective measurement noise estimates can appreciably influence estimates of kinetic parameters as well as statistical decisions about the underlying physical system @xcite .",
    "finally , extracting forces from position vs.  time data requires one to explicitly or implicitly make numerous assumptions about the underlying effective dynamics .",
    "we believe these assumptions should be systematically tested directly against experimental data before one trusts kinetic quantities inferred from experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , in live cell spt studies , reference `` ground - truth '' is rarely available .",
    "hence , techniques checking statistical assumptions directly against data are attractive ( e.g. , through goodness - of - fit hypothesis testing @xcite ) .",
    "the hdp - slds approach combines hidden markov modeling ( hmm ) , kalman filtering , @xcite , and more recent ideas from dirichlet process modeling @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate how the hdp - slds method can be used to reliably identify the time at which a state change occurs as well as the number of states implied by a specific time series . in the hdp - slds approach @xcite ,",
    "the number of underlying states are inferred from the data via nonparametric bayesian techniques @xcite .",
    "inferring the number of states jointly with the parameters determining the dynamics ( i.e. , in a single fully bayesian computation ) is useful because the number of underlying effective states is rarely known _ a priori _ in live cell spt applications due to inherent heterogeneity between and within trajectories @xcite .",
    "since the hdp - slds framework directly infers the number of states from observed data , the user does not need to provide an accurate upper bound on the number of states or worry about _ a posteriori _ model selection issues @xcite .",
    "this allows the hdp - slds approach to readily identify a wide range of distinct dynamical regimes which may occur within a single trajectory .",
    "once the experimental trajectory is segmented into distinct kinetic states , one can use classic maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) techniques to infer kinetic parameters @xcite . carrying out",
    "mle estimation after segmentation mitigates the bias induced by prior assumptions .",
    "it is emphasized throughout that the procedure described in this work can systematically account for measurement noise and complex spatial - temporal variations in thermal fluctuations & force / velocity fields .    in the particular application that we studied ,",
    "the heuristics suggested for generating hdp - slds prior parameter input required modification before accurate results could be obtained in spt applications .",
    "specifically , prior specification heuristics employed by the original hdp - slds bayesian analysis ( using guidelines outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) required substantial modification ( prior specification substantially influences both state inference and molecular motion parameter estimation ) .",
    "in particular , the  hyperparameters \" governing the measurement and thermal noise ( parameterizing components of the `` base - measure '' @xcite ) required more careful calibration / tuning before high accuracy results could be obtained . in s1 text , we discuss how ideas in refs .",
    "@xcite can be used for this type of hyperparameter tuning .",
    "we note that the experimental applications are meant to serve as a proof - of - concept .",
    "the results presented are not intended to provide an exhaustive study of the forces involved in chromosome movement in metaphase .",
    "the problem is amenable to the hdp - slds approach since the gfp tagged experiments experienced abrupt state changes in the experimental trajectories before other downstream spt computations could be reliably carried out ( e.g. , force and diffusion coefficient estimation ) .",
    "not all `` abrupt '' were visually obvious to human observers , hence the approach is promising in both data - mining and preprocessing contexts .",
    "it should also be noted that two recent articles have discussed the utility of nonparametric bayesian ideas in single - molecule data analysis @xcite ; ref .",

    "msd approaches have many undesirable features , namely they tend to introduce unnecessary temporal averaging ( i.e. , they ignore the natural time ordering of the trajectory measurements ) and they have a difficult time accounting for spatially varying forces ( a common occurrence in live cells @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : twostate ] displays another experimental trajectory with a different type of state switching which was readily identified by the hdp - slds procedure .",
    "the posterior mode computed using gibbs sampling of the hdp - slds model contained assignments with two and three states ; in total @xmath57 posterior mcmc samples were sampled .",
    "a majority of the mcmc draws implied two - state switching .",
    "however , one does not necessarily need to be concerned about the number of states if one is only interested in determine change points .",

    "accurately identifying change points can help in quantifying the transition times between distinct physical states @xcite .",

    "[ fig : mitosis ] where the spatial location of the rfp tagged mitotic spindle pole bodies ( spb ) as well as the gfp tagged chromatid trajectories are shown .",

    "[ fig : fhist1 ] .",
    "the procedure used to infer forces in fig .",
    "[ fig : fhist ] was carried out again for the pair of chromatids undergoing mitosis .",
    "the histogram of the force magnitudes is not atypical for trajectories observed , however the evolution of the force vectors was suggestive of a dynamic regime shift .    in order to probe this regime shift further , we computed the eigen - values and eigen - vectors of the mle of @xmath58 ( a matrix associated with the continuous - time overdamped langevin model ; details provided in s3 text ) .",
    "the eigen - analysis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mitosis ] provides quantitative information about variations in the effective force vector as a function of position ( i.e. , the eigen - analysis provides both magnitude and directional information about a linear vector field ) .",
    "the upper - right panel shows that the largest magnitude eigen - value consistently decreased over time for each state identified by the hdp - slds segmentation .",
    "the rate of decrease was similar for the pair of sister chromatids .",
    "this phenomenon was originally identified using the crude time window segmentation of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the hdp - slds provides a framework for more systematically dividing the trajectory into different dynamical segments .    in terms of physical interpretations , several molecular components can induce `` force cross - talk '' between sister chromatids . a potential explanation of the eigen - value phenomenon described above is that microtubules of the mitotic spindle connected to the common centromere of the sister chromatids are simultaneously inducing a common force change to both chromatids .",
    "alternatively ( or perhaps in addition ) , a common tension signal induced by chromatin loops and a network of pericentric proteins ( cohesin and condensin @xcite ) might be influencing the forces experienced by the pair of sister chromatids ; recall that the gfp dyes used are in close proximity to the centromere so molecular changes in the pericentric region can potentially influence the fluctuations observed in the tagged sister chromatids @xcite .",
    "regardless of the underlying biological cause of the phenomenon observed , the downstream eigen - analysis substantially benefited from the temporal segmentation provided by the hdp - slds framework . using the segmentation afforded by the hdp - slds method resulted in the eigen - vectors shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mitosis ] ; in this figure , the eigen - vectors associated with the largest magnitude eigen - value is displayed as a solid line and the eigen - vector associated with the smaller eigen - value of the estimated 2d @xmath58 matrix is shown by a dashed line ( the origin for the eigen - vectors correspond to the empirical average of the identified states ) .",
    "the ( real - valued ) eigen - values and eigen - vectors provide spatial information about restoring force directions experienced by the tagged chromatid .",
    "observe how the pair of chromatids both exhibit a state change occurring around 16@xmath59 .",
    "note that the time of the change point occurring around 16@xmath59 coincides for the sister chromatids , but each trajectory was processed independently by separate hdp - slds analyses . at 16@xmath59 ,",
    "the dominant eigen - vectors of the chromatids change from pointing towards the spindles to a direction nearly orthogonal to the plane connecting the two mitotic spindle poles .",
    "the eigen - values for both chromatids are decreasing at roughly the same rate ( i.e. , their effective ",
    "stiffness \" is increasing ) . also , recall that the pair of chromatids are subject to forces from multiple sources that can change in magnitude and direction ; for example , tugging induced by the microtubules connected to the centromere shared by the chromatids , forces associated with nucleosome remodeling ( e.g. , rna polymerase `` tugging '' on the strand as it makes rna ) , as well as other spring like forces induced by the shared centromere and percentric components @xcite .",
    "the various explanations posited above are admittedly speculative .",
    "what these results unambiguously show is that sister chromatids experience a force regime shift whereby the direction and magnitude of the forces ( inferred by position vs.  time data ) co - occur in both direction and magnitude .",
    "this information gives new insight into the effective forces experienced by particles in time changing , complex live cellular environment .",
    "researchers can get a more reliable `` force map '' that contains rich dynamical information beyond that contained in a mean square displacement or correlation - based analysis .",
    "note that this `` force map '' allows a spatially dependent vector field to change over time ( an important feature for detecting dynamical changes in single - molecule measurements ) .",
    "a dominant force direction pointing orthogonal to the spindle axis is highly suggestive of a new dominant force ( not induced by the microtubule pulling ) being felt by both sister chromatids .",
    "deciding the correct physical explanation of the phenomenon observed requires additional experiments , but the results obtained on the metaphase trajectories are presented in order to show the power of spt analysis coupled with hdp - slds segmentation and downstream likelihood - based time series analysis @xcite .",
    "currently we are attempting to use this type of analysis to more systematically and quantitatively probe forces associated with the various physical phenomena described here using experiments which more carefully control the types of forces that can be experienced by the gfp tagged chromatids .    before proceeding",
    ", we should note that the gfp array used to tag the chromatids induces a gradual continuous trend in the effective measurement noise ( the finding can readily be observed in s1-s3 data ) .",
    "a gradual time trend induced in large part by different fluorophores bleaching out has been observed and quantitatively studied in previous works ( see supp . mat . of ref .",
    "however , the hdp - slds formulation considered assumes a constant measurement noise for the entire duration of the trajectory .",
    "s6 - s7 figs .",
    "explore various simulations mimicking features in the experimental data ; specifically we analyze data where the effective measurement changes linearly from 15 nm to 35 nm over the course of 400 measurements ( this induces model misspecification since the hdp - slds model assumes fixed covariance ) .",
    "the linear change in measurement noise is consistent with the mle range of values observed in s3 data .",
    "s6 - s7 indicate that if one uses a prior near the temporal midpoint of the time changing measurement noise that the hdp - slds segmentation can achieve accuracy similar to the ideal situation where the hdp priors match the dgp exactly . for",
    "whatever system is being studied , it is highly recommended to employ simulations mimicking features implied by the data in order to be more confident that the segmentation output does not contain artifacts induced by features not explicitly accounted for in the underlying model .",
    "techniques accounting for gradual time trends in certain parameters extending the hdp - slds model would be an interesting future research topic .    in terms of more general applicability of this type of analysis , systematically segmenting spt trajectories into distinct dynamical regimes and then using classical statistical physics models is one alternative to using so - called anomalous diffusion models commonly used in spt analysis @xcite .",
    "this is advantageous since fitted overdamped langevin model output can readily be interpreted in terms of force , velocity , and molecular friction .",
    "furthermore , an overdamped langevin sde model can be tested directly against experimental data and the effects of measurement noise can be systematically accounted for by likelihood methods @xcite .",
    "anomalous diffusion models are more difficult to physically interpret and rigorous time series analysis ( accounting for measurement noise , sampling noise , spatially dependent forces , etc . )",
    "is challenging for various technical reasons @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated the utility of the hdp - slds method of fox et al .",
    "@xcite in automatically segmenting spt data into different dynamical regimes .",
    "the approach shows great promise in systematically processing a variety of spt data sets .",
    "when applied to experimental data , we demonstrated how new quantitative information can be extracted about transient forces experienced during mitosis in live yeast cells ; the method explicitly accounts for the statistical effects of measurement noise on top of `` thermal '' or `` process '' noise ( both sources are non - negligible in many spt applications ) .",
    "simulations results reported in s2 text were used to exhibit strengths and weaknesses of the hdp - slds approach within an spt context . work presented in ref .",
    "@xcite compared the hdp - slds approach to classic ( finite state space ) hmm models .    in terms of strengths ,",
    "the hdp - slds approach can account for an unknown number of states , position dependent anisotropic active forces , and can account for the statistical effects of measurement noise by exploiting kalman filtering modeling in conjunction with hdp ideas @xcite ; these features are not accounted for in any hmm approach currently used in spt analysis and hence the hdp - slds represents a `` state - of - the - art '' technology within this domain .",
    "the approach provides a more systematic means for the `` time window size '' selection problem discussed in ref .",
    "the hdp - slds approach was also confirmed to be fairly robust to many modeling assumptions and hyperparameters associated with hdp modeling @xcite . in situations where a collection of transient dynamical responses are experienced within a single trajectory and the `` states '' causing the different kinetics are experimentally resolvable , the data processing procedure discussed here provides an attractive alternative to anomalous diffusion modeling @xcite since the procedure can mitigate artifacts induced by aggregating distinct kinetic states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hdp - slds approach can be modified to produce output that can be readily physically interpreted in terms of classic spt models ( see sec.[sec : oddesc ] ) .    a substantial weakness of the hdp - slds approach ( also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is associated with its dependence on reliable priors for the parameters determining governing the kalman filter parameters ( i.e. , hyperparameters specifying the `` base measure '' @xcite ) . the data - driven scheme advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite for selecting the prior mean of @xmath4 exhibits undesirable properties in many spt applications ( results presented in s2 text ) . a variant of the mle - based approach of ref",

    "the formal hypothesis testing methods utilized in ref .",
    "@xcite also allow one to test the validity of a candidate segmentation and assumed dynamical model against experimental data in situations where reference ( or `` ground - truth '' ) data is unavailable .    in summary",
    ", combining recent nonparametric bayesian modeling ideas , like the hdp - slds , with frequentist ideas show great potential in quantitatively analyzing complex spt data sets . in the future , we aim to provide user - friendly software making the tools discussed herein readily accessible to the diverse set of researchers involved in spt . the development of new , statistically rigorous data processing algorithms capable of reliably extracting information about molecular motion from live cell data is becoming ever more important as _ in vivo _",

    "<S> understanding the basis for intracellular motion is critical as the field moves toward a deeper understanding of the relation between brownian forces , molecular crowding , and anisotropic ( or isotropic ) energetic forcing . </S>",
    "<S> effective forces and other parameters used to summarize molecular motion change over time in live cells due to latent state changes , e.g. , changes induced by dynamic micro - environments , photobleaching , and other heterogeneity inherent in biological processes . </S>",
    "<S> this study discusses limitations in currently popular analysis methods ( e.g. , mean square displacement - based analyses ) and how new techniques can be used to systematically analyze single particle tracking ( spt ) data experiencing abrupt state changes in time or space . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is to track gfp tagged chromatids in metaphase in live yeast cells and quantitatively probe the effective forces resulting from dynamic interactions that reflect the sum of a number of physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> state changes can be induced by various sources including : microtubule dynamics exerting force through the centromere , thermal polymer fluctuations , and dna - based molecular machines including polymerases and protein exchange complexes such as chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes . </S>",
    "<S> simulations aiming to show the relevance of the approach to more general spt data analyses are also studied . </S>",
    "<S> refined force estimates are obtained by adopting and modifying a nonparametric bayesian modeling technique , the hierarchical dirichlet process switching linear dynamical system ( hdp - slds ) , for spt applications . </S>",
    "<S> the hdp - slds method shows promise in systematically identifying dynamical regime changes induced by unobserved state changes when the number of underlying states is unknown in advance ( a common problem in spt applications ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expand on the relevance of the hdp - slds approach , review the relevant background of hierarchical dirichlet processes , show how to map discrete time hdp - slds models to classic spt models , and discuss limitations of the approach . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate new computational techniques for tuning hyperparameters and for checking the statistical consistency of model assumptions directly against individual experimental trajectories ; the techniques circumvent the need for `` ground - truth '' and/or subjective information . </S>"
