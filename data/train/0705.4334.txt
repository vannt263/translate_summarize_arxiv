    "coherence theorems are a mechanism for ensuring that an extra structure carried by a category is not too wildly behaved .",
    "this typically takes the form of an assurance that a certain large class of diagrams always commutes . in the most favourable situation ,",
    "one proves that any diagram built solely out of the structuring functors and natural transformations is guaranteed to commute .",
    "this was the case in the earliest coherence results of mac lane for monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories @xcite .    a close examination of mac lane s proof reveals a connection between covariant structures carried by categories and term rewriting theory",
    ". in particular , the proof mainly revolves around elucidating the fact that a free monoidal structure on a discrete category , considered as a term rewriting system , is terminating and confluent .",
    "`` termination '' means that there are no infinite chains of non - identity morphisms , while `` confluence '' is the property that every span may be completed into a square ( see figure [ fig : confluence ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 \\ar[d ] &   { \\cdot } \\ar@{-->}[d ] \\\\          { \\cdot } \\ar@{-->}[r ] & { \\cdot }        }      } \\ ] ]    confluence and termination together conspire to ensure that a term rewriting system has unique normal forms .",
    "that is , not only is every chain of morphisms finite , but every sequence of morphisms beginning from an object ends at a point that depends only on the starting object .",
    "this seemingly strong property is present in a very large array of structures and has , for instance , been exploited by laplaza to derive coherence theorems for directed associativity @xcite and for distributive categories @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is simply not the case that every coherent covariant structure has unique normal forms .",
    "for instance , the structure consisting of a unary functor @xmath1 and the single natural transformation @xmath2 is non - terminating , but easily seen to be coherent .",
    "a more spectacular counterexample to the hope that coherent structures have unique normal forms is provided by the theory of iterated monoidal categories @xcite , which arise as a categorical model of iterated loop spaces and fail to be confluent .",
    "we are now faced with the problem of determining sufficient conditions for coherence in terms of the underlying rewriting system of a structure that do not rely on either termination or confluence .",
    "this very quickly leads one to consider two further coherence questions : if there are diagrams that do not commute , then is there at least a decision procedure that determines whether a given diagram commutes ? is it at least true that for any finite collection of functors and natural transformations , there is always a finite set of diagrams whose commutativity implies the commutativity of all diagrams built from this structure ?",
    "this paper sets out to solve the various coherence questions by vigourously pursuing the idea that two morphisms with the same source and target in a free covariant structure on a discrete category commute precisely when they admit a planar subdivision such that each face is an instance of naturality , or of functoriality or of one of the axioms .",
    "the guiding intuition behind this approach is that a span that can not be completed into a square can never appear in such a subdivision .",
    "we begin in section [ sect : structures ] by developing a framework for viewing a two dimensional structure on a category as a term rewriting system modulo a two dimensional congruence . in section [",
    "sect : lambek ] , we resolve the problem of determining sufficient conditions for the existence of a decision procedure for the commutativity of diagrams .",
    "we call this problem the `` lambek coherence problem '' , since it is inspired by lambek s paper on closed categories and deductive systems @xcite . in section [",
    "sect : maclane ] , we determine sufficient conditions for all diagrams to commute , a problem that we call the `` mac lane coherence problem '' . as an immediate application , we construct an example of a structure that has no finite basis for mac lane coherence but is otherwise well behaved .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : imc ] , we apply the theory to iterated monoidal categories and obtain a new and conceptual proof of their coherence theorem .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe a two - dimensional covariant structure on a category as a certain type of term rewriting system . at the onset",
    ", we are presented with certain basic functors and natural transformations , together with an equational theory on the absolutely free term algebra generated by the functors , as well as an equational theory on the absolutely free reduction system generated by the natural transformations .",
    "the idea of viewing such a system as a term rewriting system can be found , for instance , in meseguer s rewriting logic @xcite .",
    "an important point to note is that rewriting logic does not allow any additional equations on reductions , beyond those required to ensure naturality and functoriality . in other words",
    ", it does not provide a facility for specifying coherence conditions .",
    "we begin by describing the first layer of structure .    given a graded set of function symbols @xmath4 and a set @xmath5 , the absolutely free term algebra generated by @xmath6 on @xmath5",
    "is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the next layer of structure adds an equational theory to @xmath7 :    given a graded set of function symbols @xmath6 , a set @xmath5 and a set of equations @xmath8 on @xmath7 , we denote by @xmath9 the quotient of @xmath7 by the smallest congruence generated by @xmath10 .",
    "we write @xmath11 $ ] for the image of a term @xmath12 under the homomorphism @xmath13 .",
    "the next layer of structure adds some reduction rules between congruence classes of @xmath9 .",
    "[ defn : trt ] a _ labelled term rewriting theory _ is a tuple @xmath14 , where @xmath5 is a countably infinite set of variables , @xmath6 is a graded set of function symbols , @xmath8 is a system of @xmath7-equations , @xmath15 is a set of labels and @xmath16 is a subset of @xmath17 satisfying the following consistency conditions :    if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in @xmath16 then @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    if @xmath22 , we write @xmath23 .",
    "a member of @xmath16 is called a _ labelled reduction rule_.    given a labelled term rewriting theory @xmath24 , the particular choice of @xmath5 and @xmath15 is irrelevant .",
    "what is important is simply that there are sufficient variables and labels .",
    "accordingly , we shall henceforth suppress explicit mention of the variables and labels and write @xmath25 for a labelled term rewriting theory .",
    "a labelled term rewriting theory embodies the basic reductions that are to generate all others .",
    "the next step is to obtain an analogue of the absolutely free term algebra for this higher dimensional layer of structure .",
    "this is achieved by the following definition , we there notation @xmath26 is an abbreviation for @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the uniform substitution of the free variables @xmath26 by @xmath29 .",
    "given a labelled term rewriting theory @xmath30 and a category @xmath31 , the set of _ reductions generated by @xmath32 _ is denoted @xmath33 and is generated inductively by the following rules :    cl    & ( inheritance )     +    & ( structure )     +    & ( replacement )     +    & ( transitivity )    in the ( inheritance ) rule , @xmath34 is in @xmath35 . in the ( structure ) rule",
    ", @xmath1 is a function symbol of rank @xmath36 . in the ( replacement ) rule .",
    "[ example : associative ]    let @xmath31 be the discrete category generated by the set @xmath37 .",
    "consider the term rewriting theory with a single binary function symbol @xmath38 , an empty equational theory on terms and the single reduction rule : @xmath39    a derivation of @xmath40 in this system is given by :    the consistency condition in definition [ defn : trt ] easily yields the following lemma , which asserts that we may equate reductions with their labels .",

    "what remains is to ensure that the function symbols behave as functors , that the reduction rules behave as natural transformations and that we can stipulate coherence conditions .",
    "let @xmath31 be a category .",
    "covariant @xmath3-structure _ on @xmath31 is a tuple @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a labelled term rewriting theory and @xmath10 is a set of equations on @xmath33 satisfying the following consistency condition :    if @xmath50 is in @xmath10 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in other words , we can set two reductions to be equal only if their source and target match .",
    "we further stipulate that the following equations form a subset of @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath55 4 .",
    "@xmath56      we have seen that @xmath57 is terminating and that every diamond in @xmath57 commutes",

    "let @xmath31 be a discrete category .",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are objects of @xmath57 having no repeated variables , then there is at most one map @xmath60 in @xmath57 .",
    "both of our general coherence theorems , theorem [ thm : lambek ] and theorem [ thm : maclane ] , rely on the underlying structure being quasicycle - free .",
    "one may well call this condition into question and wonder whether we can get away with a weaker condition . for lambek coherence , quasicycle - freeness does not capture all covariant structures known to be lambek coherent .",
    "for example , braided monoidal categories are certainly not quasicycle free and yet they are well known to be lambek coherent .",
    "however , the method for proving this adds a rewrite system to the reductions , thus expanding the amount of information available .",
    "the question still stands , then , of whether there is a property _ of the underlying term rewriting system _ that leads to lambek coherence for non - quasicycle - free structures .",
    "the reliance on quasicycle - freeness for mac lane coherence seems more fundamental .",
    "however , two of the crucial ingredients of our theory , theorem [ thm : power ] and proposition [ prop : diamond ] rely solely on acyclicity .",
    "this leads us to ask whether we can find conditions on an acyclic @xmath3-structure that ensure mac lane coherence .",
    "nevertheless , our focus on quasicycle - free structures has proven to be broad and powerful enough for us to find the conceptual reason for the coherence theorem for iterated monoidal categories .",
    "moreover , it has allowed us to show that there is a wide variety of coherence phenomena , even in the purely covariant case .",
