    "we consider the invariant hadron density @xmath4 in the limit @xmath5 or @xmath6 and we define @xmath7 if we calculate the momentum spectrum of gluons within perturbative qcd we find that the lowest order contribution , i.e. the born term , dominates in the soft limit .",
    "this leads to some universal features for the various processes although they show very different features with increasing complexity in the multi - particle final states : quark and gluon jet production in , spectator jets and underlying event in @xmath1 and collective phenomena in @xmath8 collisions . nevertheless , in the soft limit",
    ", we expect for the final state gluons the following properties : + 1 .  momentum spectra become energy independent ; + 2 .",
    "the relative normalisation of spectra in different processes is given by the colour factors which appear in the born term for the respective minimal partonic process .",
    "+ the arguments hold for partons and we assume these properties are also valid for hadrons .",
    "first , we present qualitative arguments for this behaviour .",
    "a soft gluon is coherently emitted by all final state partons .",
    "due to its large wavelength it can not resolve the intrinsic structure of the bunches of partons and so it `` sees '' only the overall colour charge of the primary partons .    the details of this study with the emphasis on @xmath1 and @xmath8 results are presented in ref .",
    "the corresponding properties for annihilation were obtained already some time ago @xcite ( for a recent overview , see @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusive spectra can be derived using evolution equations , similar to the well known dglap equation , but with modification at small momenta to include coherence effects of soft gluons ( for a review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the simplest double logarithmic approximation with fixed coupling @xmath9",
    "one finds for the inclusive distribution in angle @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 the perturbative expansion @xmath12 the first term on the r.h.s . represents",
    "the well known born expression for the soft bremsstrahlung which is independent of jet energy @xmath13 and holds the colour factor for the quark or gluon jet , respectively , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this term dominates if the transverse momentum @xmath16 approaches the lowest value at the cut - off @xmath17 , and this property remains valid in more exact calculations .",
    "the application to hadrons assumes similarity of parton and hadron spectra as required by the lphd concept  @xcite with small @xmath17 of few 100 mev and accounting for the mass effects .",
    "then a good description of the data in a wide range of energies @xmath18 gev is obtained demonstrating the approach to a limiting behaviour for @xmath6 .",
    "the difference between quark and gluon jets and the appearance of colour factors in the born term ( [ dborn ] ) is best demonstrated in the measurement of soft radiation in 3-jet events perpendicular to the jet plane for which case the formulae for particle densities are given in  @xcite .",
    "varying the inter - jet angles one can interpolate between the collinear configurations corresponding to @xmath19 and @xmath20 dipoles .",
    "this allows a test of the prediction @xmath21 the measurement by delphi @xcite confirmed this expectation and allowed a determination of the ratio in ( [ rgq ] ) as @xmath22 consistent with @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of total multiplicities in quark and gluon jets acquires large corrections to the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "we consider next the soft particle production in the non - diffractive `` minimum bias '' events in @xmath1 collisions . as in annihilation",
    "we look for the minimal partonic process which could be responsible for the very soft gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "we assume that the minimal process of lowest order corresponds to the semihard one - gluon exchange between any two partons in the proton with a dominantly small scattering angle and a non - vanishing cross section at high energies .",
    "the exchange of a gluon between the partons in the proton leads to two separating outgoing partonic systems which give rise to gluon bremsstrahlung from the effective colour octet dipole . in the simplest case",
    "each proton splits into a quark - diquark pair which scatter via one - gluon exchange .",
    "also more complex partonic processes could occur with two colour octet systems , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    therefore , we expect limiting behaviour of the soft particle density in @xmath1 collisions , @xmath25 , for @xmath6 or @xmath5 at fixed rapidity @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , we predict the ratio to the corresponding density in annihilations @xmath27 similar to the case of primary @xmath20 and @xmath19 dipoles .",
    "the @xmath28 distributions in both processes differ and , therefore , the integrated multiplicities differ as well . in order to test these predictions",
    "we studied the invariant cross sections @xmath29 measured in the energy range @xmath30 gev at the colliders at bnl , cern and fermilab .",
    "after normalisation to the inelastic cross section , @xmath31 , we found the corresponding density @xmath32 from extrapolation of the @xmath28 spectra to @xmath33 .",
    "most experimental groups fitted their data using parametrisations with the small @xmath28 behaviour @xmath34 which work well down to the smallest measured values of @xmath35 gev .",
    "we derive @xmath36 from these fits . the functional form ( [ invfit ] ) ,",
    "however , is not analytic at @xmath33 .",
    "there is no such problem from the theoretical point of view for the `` thermal '' parametrisation in terms of the transverse mass @xmath37 instead of @xmath28 @xmath38 this form was applied by the phobos collaboration @xcite , and they obtained a good fit to their @xmath39 data down to @xmath40 gev . with such extrapolation the resulting value of @xmath25 is found @xmath4125% lower as compared to the fit with parametrisation ( [ invfit ] ) .    the results from the available published exponential extrapolations and normalisation to inelastic cross sections @xmath31 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i0 ] .",
    "the data on @xmath25 are seen to be consistent with energy independence over two orders of magnitude in energy @xmath42 with fluctuations around a mean value @xmath43 gev@xmath44 .",
    "the different functional forms of extrapolations mentioned above do not affect this conclusion  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath28-integrated rapidity density @xmath45 doubles in this energy range .",
    "the observation of energy independence is similar to that in annihilation and corresponds to the expectation from coherent bremsstrahlung .",
    "in contrast , for an incoherent superposition of several sources one would expect a rising @xmath25 , since the number of such processes would typically increase with energy",
    ". it will be interesting to obtain corresponding results from the lhc at the higher energies to test this possibility .",
    "some results were obtained by cms  @xcite which show the convergence of spectra at different energies towards @xmath33 .",
    "since the soft gluon emission is driven by the lowest order diagram we predict the same limiting behaviour ( @xmath46 in @xmath42 at @xmath5 ) to be observed at any rapidity and not _ only _ at @xmath47 and we expect a flat rapidity plateau in this limit .",
    "this is true , as long as we can neglect the kinematical boundary effects for large rapidities @xmath26 . to study the rapidity dependence it is important to perform calculations with the exact kinematics using particle masses .",
    "the use of pseudorapidity @xmath48 will lead to a different spectral shape in @xmath49 and @xmath28 as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for comparison of particle densities in @xmath1 and collisions in order to test eq .",
    "( [ ratio94 ] ) it is better to use for normalisation the non - diffractive cross section which we take as being 15% lower than the inelastic one , and we obtain @xmath50  gev@xmath44@xcite",
    ". then we find for the non - diffractive ( minimum bias ) events for a thermal fit the reduced value @xmath51 in order to compare with annihilation let us consider two results .",
    "the tpc/2@xmath52 collaboration @xcite directly compared their own data on annihilation with the @xmath1 data by the bs  collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 spectrum in the @xmath1 collision is found to be steeper than that in annihilation , which is determined with respect to the sphericity axis .",
    "the extrapolation down to the smallest @xmath28 yields a larger density in @xmath1 collisions by factors 2.0 - 2.7 depending on the type of the fit .",
    "other  experiments presented cross sections as a function of particle energy . using their exponential fits in this variable in the energy range @xmath53 gev",
    "we find @xmath54 gev@xmath44 or the ratio @xmath55 where the first ( preferred ) number refers to the thermal and the second to the exponential extrapolation .",
    "this result is consistent with our expectation for this ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the approximate energy independence of the quantity @xmath32 in both collision processes and that their ratio is close to 2 are remarkable and represent a serious argument in favour of the dominance of the elementary bremsstrahlung process , also in soft @xmath1 collisions .",
    "for nuclear collisions the data are often presented in terms of a corresponding ratio to the @xmath1 collision according to the two limiting cases :    \\1 .",
    "we can define the `` nuclear modification factor '' @xmath57 which is equal to unity in the case of a pointlike interaction . here",
    "the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath58 can be calculated from the glauber model .",
    "another limiting case applies to the bulk particle production without any hard scale . in such a case",
    "we expect that soft particles are produced coherently over a certain range @xmath59 characteristic for a nucleon ( or even nucleus ) which results in a reduced rate .",
    "indeed , all collaborations at rhic @xcite find that the ratio @xmath60 is falling below unity for small @xmath28 .",
    "data in this kinematic region are conveniently presented by normalising to the number of `` participating nucleons '' @xmath61 bialas , bleszynski and czyz @xcite have introduced the concept of participating nucleons , or `` wounded nucleons '' in their terms , and observed that @xmath62 for soft production , which means that each interacting nucleon should be counted only once and rescatterings be disregarded .",
    "as before , we consider first the energy dependence of the particle density at @xmath5 .",
    "the variation of @xmath28 spectra between the two energies 62.4 and 200 gev was studied for different centralities by phobos  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factors @xmath60 approach about the same values for the two energies at small @xmath63 gev , and the same is true for @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that the energy dependence of @xmath8 data is as weak as that of @xmath1 data .",
    "next we investigate the normalisation of @xmath28 spectra in @xmath8 collisions .",
    "this follows from the observation  @xcite @xmath65 for small @xmath28 , i.e. approximate validity of `` participant scaling '' .",
    "we studied the issue further by combining the high accuracy @xmath1 and @xmath39 data from star @xcite at 200 gev with the corresponding nuclear data from phobos that extend towards low @xmath66 gev . using the thermal parametrisation ( [ invfitth ] ) we find @xmath67 which is compatible with the calculated @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the normalisation in the soft limit is consistent with @xmath69 we find it quite remarkable that this simple relation works with good accuracy of about 10% which corresponds to the accuracy of both the measurement and the theoretical calculation .",
    "note , in particular , that relation ( [ raapart ] ) is only valid in the limit @xmath5 and is violated by about 50% already at @xmath70  gev ( see star  @xcite ) ; also note that the observed particle density for the `` wounded nucleon '' interactions is strongly suppressed ( @xmath71 ) by the coherence effects and it is about six times smaller than for the incoherent superposition of nuclear scatterings ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "within our approach we should relate this normalisation of particle density in the soft limit ( [ raapart ] ) to the minimal parton configuration responsible for the emission of a large wavelength gluon . in this limit with `` participant scaling , '' nucleons of one nucleus interact with some nucleons of the other nucleus several times but the outgoing partonic system acts again like a colour octet source such as if it had scattered only once as in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "one could think of two mechanisms leading to such a result .",
    "the primary interaction in a single nucleon - nucleon collision responsible for a `` minimum bias '' event leads to the break up of the scattered nucleons dominantly into quark - diquark systems which form colour singlet or octet states only .",
    "one could argue that such a semihard collision with @xmath73 gev may not resolve higher fock states in the proton of typically smaller size",
    ". then the soft hadrons will not be sensitive to higher partonic excitations either .- integrated rapidity distributions . ]",
    "another argument can be based on an assumption that at high energies the multi - gluon exchange related to multiple scatterings of the same nucleon dominantly proceeds via the colour octet exchange , while the higher colour multiplets ( such as decuplet or 27-plet ) are disfavoured .",
    "note that in the non - abelian gauge theory the intercept of the reggeised gluon @xmath74 ( i.e. the spin of the on - mass - shell gluon is equal to one ) while the j - plane singularities corresponding to the exchange of the higher colour multiplets are situated to the left of @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exchange of higher colour multiplets are asymptotically suppressed .",
    "it remains a challenge to understand the rapid disappearance with @xmath28 of the limiting density ( [ raapart ] ) .",
    "another interesting simplified structure appears for particle ratios in the low @xmath28 region .",
    "if we compare @xcite the @xmath28 dependence of such ratios from annihilation ( @xmath28 with respect to sphericity axis ) with those from @xmath1 scattering @xcite and also ratios from @xmath1 and @xmath8 collisions by phenix and star we observe the convergence of these spectra in the region of low @xmath76  gev while they are quite different otherwise .",
    "this could be related to the universal bremsstrahlung from the colour sources in the considered processes in this soft limit .",
    "this observation implies that the soft particles decouple from equilibration in nuclear collisions .",
    "the soft particles in the central rapidity region are produced first and they stay behind if the system expands .",
