    "the code is configured to operate in collisionless mode , since the collisional mean - free path of relativistic particles in the vacuum absorption region we are interested in is much longer than the region scale - size . to confirm this ,",
    "we have carried out several collisions - on simulations and found no appreciable difference in the quantities of interest .",
    "particles are fully kinetic and are represented using 210 electrons per cell and 90 ions per cell , meaning there are @xmath204 macroparticles in the simulations at the initial timestep .",
    "the higher mass of the ions means they can be efficiently modeled using fewer particles , and the particle weighting has been adjusted to preserve charge neutrality at @xmath205 in the simulation .",
    "we have carried out an extensive survey of conditions and verified that all quantities of interest converge using this value .",
    "the diagnostic which is used to calculate the absorption in the simulations tracks the cumulative kinetic energy coupled into each of the @xmath20 particle species over time .",
    "these values are normalized to the total field energy injected into the simulation box for an `` empty '' run which is absent the supercritical target .",
    "following the interaction between the laser and matter , which occurs at around 150  fs due to the hydrodynamic effect , this procedure directly yields a clean measurement for @xmath21 . for the steady - state interaction",
    "this has been demonstrated in previous works to be exactly equivalent to equation ( 1 ) of the main manuscript text  @xcite .",
    "the hole - boring velocity @xmath79 is calculated by tracking the supercritical interface at the simulation midplane @xmath206 during the steady - state laser - plasma interaction from 100 - 130 fs .",
    "the supercritical interface axial location @xmath207 is defined by @xmath208 so the velocity of the interface is calculated as @xmath209 .",
