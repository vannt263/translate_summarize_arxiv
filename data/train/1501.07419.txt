    "the exploration of underlying mechanism for anomalous and normal heat conduction in low dimensional systems represents a huge challenge in the area of statistical physics  @xcite . after enormous efforts for more than one decade from numerical simulations@xcite , theoretical predictions@xcite and experimental observations@xcite",
    ", there is still no consensus for the exact physical mechanism causing anomalous heat conduction .",
    "it is believed that momentum conservation plays an important role in determining the actual heat conduction behavior . in general ,",
    "1d non - integrable lattices with momentum conserving property should have anomalous heat conduction where the thermal conductivity @xmath1 diverges with the lattice size @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , the 1d coupled rotator lattice is a well known exception .",
    "it exhibits normal heat conduction behavior despite its momentum conserving nature  @xcite .    the normal heat conduction in 1d coupled rotator lattice was discovered via numerical simulations by two groups independently  @xcite .",
    "in order to understand the underlying mechanism , the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity has been studied in detail in both works . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of coupled rotator lattice has been found to be like @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a positive constant .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of @xmath7 was claimed where @xmath8 is a positive constant .",
    "there it was also argued that a possible phase transition at temperature around @xmath9 where heat conduction is normal above this temperature while anomalous below this temperature exists  @xcite . although this phase transition statement was challenged as a finite size effect  @xcite , a later work supported this phase transition conjecture after deriving a similar temperature dependent thermal conductivity as @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the 1d coupled rotator lattice re - attracts much attention due to the new finding of simultaneously existing normal diffusion of momentum as well as heat energy  @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the normal behavior might be due to the reduced number of conserved quantities which is unique for periodic interaction potentials  @xcite .",
    "but the new debate is that whether the stretch is conserved or not in 1d coupled rotator lattice .",
    "the investigation of 1d coupled rotator lattice will be the key to unravel the true mechanism behind the connection between momentum conservation and normal or anomalous heat conduction .",
    "therefore , it is the right time to revisit the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of 1d coupled rotator lattice as a first step .    in this work , we will revisit the temperature dependence of thermal conductivities for the 1d coupled rotator lattice .",
    "we find that the temperature dependence is neither @xmath5 nor @xmath7 as previously claimed  @xcite .",
    "the actual temperature dependence is a power - law dependence as @xmath10 .",
