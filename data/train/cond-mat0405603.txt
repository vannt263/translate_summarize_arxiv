    "however , macroscopically one can find phenomenological equations for the time evolution which are based on macroscopic quantities only , e.g.  the diffusion equation , the heat transport equation and the navier - stokes equations for hydrodynamics .    in perhaps one of the most simple microscopic cases , a system of interacting brownian particles , a number of equations for the time evolution of the particle density have been proposed which aim to incorporate results from equilibrium density functional theory .",
