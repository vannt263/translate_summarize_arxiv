    ", the expected 2-cm flux would be just some 30 @xmath10jy , around 40 times less than the measured value .",
    "it is therefore inferred that a star with an early spectral type exists inside her  36  se that gives rise to a small region responsible for the radio emission .",

    "the lyman continuum photon - rate is reproducible only by a star earlier than b2 if the star is at the zero - age main sequence @xcite . on the other hand , in order not to create a parsec - scale region , the hydrogen density has to be as high as @xmath33  @xmath34 .",

    "we may use the highly distorted dust emission from her  36  se as circumstantial evidence that the source is actually under the influence of herschel  36 , and that the physical distance to the o star is not significantly larger than it appears .    on the other hand",

    "the mid - infrared spectrum of @xmath64  ori  irs  1 shows the partly crystalline silicate in emission .",
    "the presence of processed silicates suggests significant grain growth which is naturally present in a circumstellar disk .",
    "a proplyd is therefore again the most probable cause of @xmath64  ori  irs  1 , especially because a central star has been detected recently in the @xmath41-band continuum emission ( b. stecklum , private communication ) .",
    "the star - forming region around herschel  36 has many features in common with the orion nebula cluster .",
    "the local concentration of massive stars , like her  36  b , together forms a trapezium - like cluster around herschel  36 .",
    "the presence of known proplyd nearby at g5.97@xmath91.17 @xcite underscores the physical similarity as well .",
    "the mid - infrared color of her  36  se , and the close vicinity to an o - type star with a distorted morphology suggestive of radiative influence of it all point toward her  36  se is also a proplyd with a low - mass star at its center , as is the case for sc3 at @xmath63  ori  c and @xmath64  ori  irs  1 .",
    "however , in addition to the radio luminosity hardly accounted for by a low - mass star , and no ionized - front outside the dusty cloud ; a proplyd can not explain the lack of a point source to be detected at the continuum wavelengths that comes from the photospheric emission of the star .",
    "in the case of no central star inside , another possibility would be that her  36  se is an evaporating gaseous globule , a failed proplyd without an internal star in formation .",
    "these starless cores have been detected in numbers toward m  16 @xcite .",
    "however , a hypothetical starless globule conflicts with the presence of the unresolved br@xmath0 emission apparently inside of her  36  se .",
    "we therefore propose that her  36  se harbors a relatively massive star of early b - type producing a squeezed region inside the dusty cloud @xcite , but the star itself is completely obscured .",
    "the distortion of dust emission as well as the diffuse emission downstream of her  36  se , indicates the close physical interaction of herschel  36 and se .",
