    "one of the main interests in hypernuclear physics is to investigate how an addition of @xmath0 particle influences the properties of atomic nuclei . due to the absence of pauli s principle between nucleon and @xmath0 particle",
    ", it is believed that a @xmath0 hyperon can be treated as an _ impurity _ to probe deep interior of the nuclear medium . with the presence of hyperon as an impurity , some bulk properties of nuclei such as the shape and collective motions",
    "may be changed @xcite .",
    "indeed , the shrinkage of @xmath5li , with respect to @xmath6li , has been observed experimentally by measuring the b(e2 ) value from the @xmath7 state to the @xmath8 state of @xmath5li @xcite .    as the shape of nuclei plays a decisive role in determining their properties such as quadrupole moment and radius ,",
    "mean - field model calculations have been performed in recent years to investigate the change of nuclear shape due to the addition of a @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "deformed skyrme - hartree - fock(shf ) studies in ref . @xcite",
    "have shown that the deformation parameter of the hypernuclei which they studied is slightly smaller ( within the same sign ) than that of the corresponding core nuclei , and thus no significant effect of @xmath0 hyperon on nuclear deformation was found .",
    "on the other hand , we have performed a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) study and found that the nuclear deformation of the core nuclei completely disappears for @xmath9c and @xmath10si hypernuclei due to the addition of @xmath0 particle @xcite , although we have obtained similar results to the shf calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite for many other hypernuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have compared between the shf and rmf approaches and have shown that the different results with respect to nuclear deformation between the two approaches is due to the fact that the rmf yields a somewhat stronger polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon as compared to the shf approach .",
    "we have also shown that the disappearance of the deformation realizes also in the shf approach if the energy difference between the optimum deformation and the spherical configuration is less than about 1 mev @xcite .",
    "all of these mean - field calculations have assumed axial symmetric deformation .",
    "although many nuclei are considered to have axially symmetric shape , the triaxial degree of freedom plays an important role in transitional nuclei , nuclei with shape coexistence , and nuclei with gamma soft deformation @xcite .",
    "in particular , we mention that recent studies with the constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov plus local quasi - particle random phase approximation ( chfb+lqrpa ) method @xcite as well as the rmf plus generator coordinate method ( rmf+gcm ) @xcite have revealed an important role of triaxiality in large amplitude collective motion in sd - shell nuclei .    the aim of this paper is to extend the previous mean - field studies on deformation of hypernuclei by taking into account the triaxial degree of freedom , that is , by including both the @xmath11 and @xmath4 deformations in order to investigate the effect of @xmath0 hyperon in the full ( @xmath11,@xmath4 ) deformation plane .",
