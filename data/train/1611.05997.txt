    "quantum - enhanced optical phase estimation through the mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) is important for multiple areas of scientific research  @xcite , such as imaging , sensing , and high - precision gravitational waves detection .",
    "the mzi - based optical phase estimation consists of three steps ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "first , a two - mode input state of the light is prepared .",
    "second , the light passes successively through a beam splitter , the unknown relative phase shift @xmath6 between the two arms of the mzi , and another beam splitter , and evolves to the output state .",
    "third , the output state is measured for many times and the outcomes @xmath7 is processed to construct an unbiased estimator @xmath8 to the unknown parameter @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the estimation precision is quantified by the standard deviation @xmath9 . by using optimal data processing techniques to extract all the information contained in the data , the estimation precision from @xmath10 repeated measurements is given by the cramr - rao lower bound  @xcite : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the classical fisher information ( cfi ) for the measurement scheme used . given the input state , maximizing @xmath12 over all possible measurement schemes gives the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xmath13 and hence the quantum cramr - rao bound @xmath14  @xcite , which sets an ultimate precision for estimating the unknown phase shift @xmath6 .",
    "usually , the precision @xmath15 improves with increasing number of photons @xmath3 contained in the input state .",
    "using a coherent - state of light as the input , the achievable phase sensitivity per measurement is limited by the classical ( or shot noise ) limit @xmath16 , as the qfi @xmath17 .    to improve the precision beyond the classical limit ( @xmath18 ) ,",
    "it is necessary to employ quantum resources , such as entanglement and squeezing in the input state  caves , giovannetti , ma , aasi , dowling15,matthews , luca . in this context",
    ", the squeezed states of light play an important role and have been widely studied in the past decades ever since the pioneer work of caves in 1981  @xcite , who shows that by feeding a coherent state @xmath19 into one port of the mzi and a squeezed vacuum @xmath20 into the other port , the unknown phase shift can be estimated with a precision beyond the classical limit . in 2008 ,",
    "pezz and smerzi  @xcite further suggested that the previously used phase estimator based on the averaged relative photon number is not optimal .",
    "when the injected fields are phase matched , i.e. , the phases of two light fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 obeying @xmath23 , the qfi can reach the heisenberg scaling @xmath24 for a given mean photon number @xmath25 . more importantly , this qfi can be saturated by the cfi for ideal photon counting measurements .",
    "consequently , by using the optimal data processing technique ( such as the maximum - likelihood estimation or bayesian estimation ) to process these measurement outcomes , the phase estimation precision can attain the heisenberg limit @xmath26 .",
    "recently , lang and caves  @xcite proved that given the total average photon number @xmath3 of the input state , if a coherent light is fed into one input port of the mzi , then the squeezed vacuum is the optimal state to inject into the second input port .",
    "et al_.  @xcite have analyzed the phase - matching condition ( pmc ) that maximizes the qfi in the squeezed - state interferometer , where a superposition of even or odd number of photons is injected from one port of the interferometer and any input state from another .",
    "an important requirement of these theoretical works  @xcite is to take into account all the photon - counting events , which in turn requires photon - number - resolving detectors with perfect number resolution  seshadreesan .",
    "however , on the experimental side , the best detector up to date can only resolve the number of photons up to @xmath27  smerzi07,kardynal .",
    "this makes it unclear whether or not the heisenberg limit of the estimation precision can still be achieved by using realistic photon detectors with an upper threshold on the number resolution . to bridge this gap between the theory and experiments , it is of interest to investigate the experimentally achievable estimation precision when the total number of photons being detected is limited , i.e. , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 determines the number resolution by a single photon - counting detector .",
    "since the existence of an upper threshold @xmath30 essentially amounts to discarding the information contained in photon - counting events with the number of photons larger than @xmath30 , it is therefore important to investigate the distribution of the qfi and cfi in the @xmath0-photon components of the coherent @xmath31 squeezed vacuum input state and calculate how much the qfi is kept with a finite number resolution .",
    "in addition , studying the distribution of the qfi and cfi in the @xmath0-photon components also helps to understand the phase estimation precision in recent post - selection experiments .",
    "when the mzi is fed by the coherent @xmath31 squeezed vacuum , the state after the first beam splitter of the mzi contains a small fraction of the path - entangled noon state  @xcite , which is a well - known @xmath0-photon non - classical state that allows the phase estimation precision to achieve the heisenberg limit  kok , pryde , boto , mitchell , walther , cable , toppel . in the limit latexmath:[$%",
    "@xmath2-fold oscillations of the coincidence rates for @xmath0 up to @xmath33 , manifesting the appearance of @xmath0-photon noon states .",
    "however , the generation probability of a @xmath0-photon noon state decreases dramatically with increasing @xmath0 , e.g. , the @xmath33-photon count rate @xmath34 per @xmath35 second  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to study the overall estimation precision when such small generation probabilities are included , since there are general conclusions that the generated state under postselection can not improve the precision for estimating a single parameter when the _ total _ number of input photons are included ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "combes , pang , haine ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the distribution of the qfi and cfi in the different @xmath0-photon components of the coherent @xmath1 squeezed vacuum input state and provide the achievable estimation precision by using imperfect photon counters with an upper threshold @xmath30 for the photon number resolution . under the pmc @xmath36 , we show that the cfi always saturates the qfi for each _ individual _ @xmath0-photon component .",
    "consequently , when the detectable number of photons is upper bounded by @xmath30 , the phase estimation precision @xmath37 is always equal to @xmath38 and both of them are determined by the sum of the cfi or equivalently the qfi for each @xmath0-photon component with @xmath0 up to @xmath30 .",
