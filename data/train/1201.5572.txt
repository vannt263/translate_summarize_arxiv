    "the production of an electroweak boson , followed by its decay to leptons , is one of the most basic hard - scattering processes at hadron colliders . with more than @xmath4 of data ,",
    "the lhc experiments have now recorded millions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 bosons decaying into lepton pairs , which allows for precision measurements , even at large transverse momentum @xmath5 of the boson . given that @xmath2 s and @xmath1 s at high @xmath5 provide an important background to new physics searches and are used to calibrate jet energy scales , it is important to have good theoretical control of the cross section in this region .",
    "the complete @xmath6 corrections to vector boson production are known and have been implemented into numerical codes which allow for arbitrary cuts on the final state @xcite .",
    "however , since the @xmath5-spectrum starts at @xmath7 , these codes only provide the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections for boson production at large transverse momentum .",
    "there is an ongoing effort to evaluate electroweak boson production in association with a jet to nnlo .",
    "the necessary two - loop results for the production of photons , @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s are known for some time @xcite .",
    "very recently , also the two - loop results for higgs production in association with a jet were presented @xcite . to obtain the transverse momentum spectrum at nnlo",
    ", these virtual corrections have to be combined with the real - emission corrections , which is a difficult task because of the very singular nature of the individual contributions .    while the real - emission corrections are complicated in general , they simplify close to the partonic threshold . in this region ,",
    "the hadronic final state consists of a single , low - mass jet and all radiation must either be soft , or collinear to the jet or the incoming hadrons . in this situation ,",
    "the partonic cross section factorizes into a hard function times the convolution of a jet function with a soft function : @xmath8 this factorization holds channel by channel , but with different hard , jet and soft functions . for @xmath0 , @xmath2 or @xmath1 production , there are two channels , the annihilation channel @xmath9 and the compton process @xmath10 . for higgs production ,",
    "the two relevant channels are @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a detailed derivation of the factorization formula in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite and one - loop results for various ingredients were given in @xcite .",
    "by now , almost all of the ingredients to obtain the threshold cross section to nnlo are known .",
    "the hard function @xmath3 contains the virtual corrections , and can be obtained from the results in @xcite .",
    "the two - loop jet functions @xmath13 for quark and gluon jets were evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the only missing ingredient is the nnlo soft function @xmath14 which is computed in the present paper .",
    "the scale associated with the soft radiation is lower than the scale @xmath5 which is relevant for the hard function . as a consequence ,",
    "the cross section contains perturbative logarithms of scale ratios which should be resummed . at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy ,",
    "this was achieved in @xcite . in the papers @xcite the resummation",
    "was recently extended to nnll . using the results of @xcite ,",
    "all the anomalous dimensions necessary for n@xmath15ll resummation were derived in @xcite . with the soft function computed in the present paper , the resummation can thus now be performed at n@xmath15ll accuracy .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     not only the color structure , but also the dependence of the soft function on the light - cone vectors @xmath16 is very simple , because of the invariance of the wilson lines under a rescaling @xmath17 of the reference vectors . from the definition ( [ softdef ] ) it follows that under a simultaneous rescaling @xmath18 the soft function transforms as @xmath19 the dependence of the soft function on the reference vectors",
    "must thus be of the form @xmath20 where the quantity @xmath21 is invariant under the rescaling ( [ rescale ] ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath22 in @xmath21 has been inserted for convenience .",
    "having discussed its general structure , we now turn to the evaluation of the soft function to nnlo .",
    "since the soft lagrangian of scet is identical to the ordinary qcd lagrangian , the computation can be performed in qcd itself . at tree level",
    "only the vacuum state contributes , and the soft function is trivially given by a delta - function . at nlo",
    "both virtual corrections to the vacuum state and one - gluon emission diagrams arise . in dimensional",
    "regularization the virtual graphs are scaleless and vanish . as the kinematic dependence of the soft function involves all of the reference vectors @xmath16 , see ( [ omegahat ] ) , the diagrams must have at least one gluon attachment to the wilson line @xmath23 and one to @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that only the diagram @xmath25 in figure [ fig : diagrams ] gives a non - vanishing contribution at nlo , while diagrams such as ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ fig : zero ] are scaleless and vanish .",
    "the calculation of diagram @xmath25 reduces to the computation of the integral @xmath26 this integral has been evaluated in @xcite in an expansion in @xmath27 up to the finite term , but here we also need higher order terms .",
    "as detailed in appendix [ oneloop ] , we have computed this integral in closed form and obtain @xmath28 which is in agreement with the result from @xcite .    at nnlo",
    "the purely virtual corrections are again scaleless and vanish . among the mixed virtual - real and the double real emissions , only the diagrams in figure [ fig : diagrams ] are non - zero .",
    "the respective color factors can be worked out in the color - space formalism , as discussed above .",
    "we find @xmath29 for diagram @xmath30 , @xmath31 for diagram @xmath32 , @xmath33 for diagrams @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the non - abelian diagrams @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the diagrams in figure [ fig : diagrams ] only involve attachments to the wilson lines @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in addition there are diagrams with attachments to the wilson line @xmath39 .",
    "an example of such a diagram is the graph ( c ) in figure [ fig : zero ] . the color structure of this diagram is @xmath40 which , by color conservation , vanishes when acting on three - parton states @xmath41 . in fact , the diagram vanishes in general : it could only be non - zero if it contained an anti - symmetric function of the three vectors @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , the only invariant @xmath21 is symmetric under the interchange @xmath45 and thus all diagrams with the color structure ( [ antisymm ] ) vanish .",
    "the remaining abelian diagrams with attachments to all three wilson lines also vanish , because at least one of the subdiagrams involves only two light - cone vectors and these integrals are thus scaleless .",
    "the technical aspects of the nnlo calculation are given in appendix [ twoloop ] , where we discuss the evaluation and give results for all integrals associated with the diagrams in figure [ fig : diagrams ] .",

    "the function @xmath63 is also what is needed to perform soft - gluon resummation in the momentum space formalism of @xcite .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since all the necessary anomalous dimensions are known , the @xmath2-factor is completely determined at the two - loop level .",
    "the cancellation of all divergences @xmath78 , for @xmath79 , in the renormalized result provides a strong check of our calculation .",
    "we finally obtain for the non - logarithmic two - loop coefficient @xmath80 which is the main result of our paper .",
    "note that the coefficient of the color structure @xmath31 is just one half of the one - loop coefficient squared .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - abelian exponentiation theorem for wilson lines .",
    "note that the relation would be more complicated for the momentum space function .",
    "since the position - space and laplace - space functions are related by wick rotation , the non - abelian exponentiation takes the same form as in position space .    to illustrate the size of the corrections",
    ", we now evaluate the soft function numerically for @xmath81 . for @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , we find @xmath84 while the case @xmath85 , which is relevant for @xmath86 and for higgs production , yields @xmath87 in the first case , the corrections are quite small : setting @xmath88 and varying @xmath89 the two - loop contribution is below half a per - cent .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for @xmath85 .",
    "while the constant piece is small , the corrections can be sizable , if the soft function is not evaluated at its natural scale : for @xmath88 and @xmath90 , for example , the perturbative expansion reads @xmath91 . in a resummed computation ,",
    "the hard , jet and soft functions are evaluated near their natural scale and so we do not expect large corrections to the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , to make definite statements , the different two - loop ingredients should be combined , which will be done elsewhere .",
    "we have computed the soft emissions for electroweak boson production at large transverse momentum near the partonic threshold to two - loop order .",
    "the relevant soft function involves light - like wilson lines in three directions : along the beam directions and along the direction of the final - state jet recoiling against the electroweak boson .",
    "the invariance of the wilson lines under a rescaling of the reference vectors puts strong constraints on the form of the result and greatly simplifies the computation .",
    "in particular , the diagrams which involve emissions or absorptions from the jet wilson line vanish in dimensional regularization , such that the computation ends up being similar to earlier computations of dijet soft functions .    with our result , the last remaining ingredient to extend the threshold resummation for electroweak boson production processes to n@xmath15ll is now available .",
    "in the future , we will combine our result with the two - loop jet and hard functions to obtain improved predictions for transverse momentum spectra .    this work is supported in part by funds provided by the schweizerischer nationalfonds ( snf ) .",

    "gives rise to an hypergeometric function and one is left with @xmath113 after performing a variable transformation to the argument of the hypergeometric function , the integral can be solved in closed form and we obtain @xmath114",
    "the calculation of the nnlo diagrams proceeds along the same lines as the nlo calculation that we outlined in appendix [ oneloop ] . here",
    "we briefly describe the new elements that arise at nnlo , and give results for the individual integrals associated with the diagrams in figure [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "we start with diagram @xmath30 .",
