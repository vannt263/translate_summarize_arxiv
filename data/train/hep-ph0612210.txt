    "although the quark model has achieved great successes for several decades , the fundamental structures of scalar mesons are still controversial .",
    "so far , there is not a definite answer on whether they are two - quark states , multiquark states or even glueball , molecule states among the light scalars yet @xcite .",
    "much efforts have been given to the study of decay and production of these mesons .",
    "however , many theoretical predictions on properties of scalar mesons , in particular on the production of them in exclusive heavy flavor hadron decays @xcite have large uncertainties due to the complicated non - perturbative effects .",
    "it is no doubt that the hadronic light - cone distribution amplitudes are the important ingredients when applying factorization theorem to analyze these exclusive processes .",
    "the distribution amplitudes which are governed by the renormalization group equation can be obtained by integrating out the transverse momenta of quarks in hadron for hadronic wave functions .",
    "unfortunately , only twist-2 light cone distribution amplitudes of scalar mesons have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "so the unknown twist-3 distribution amplitudes will bring obvious uncertainties to the final results . in this work",
    ", we investigate twist-3 distribution amplitudes of scalar mesons in order to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions of the scalar mesons .",
    "the calculation of moments for distribution amplitudes making use of qcd sum rules was presented in much detail in the pioneer work of @xcite .",
    "once the moments are known , we can construct various models to obtain the distribution amplitudes for hadrons .",
    "following the same method , we will calculate the first two non - zero moments of twist-3 distribution amplitudes for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively based on renormalization group improved qcd sum rules .",
    "besides , we will expand the twist-3 distribution amplitudes of scalar mesons according to gegenbauer polynomials as usual and use the moments obtained to determine the first two gegenbauer coefficients .",
    "as for @xmath2 and @xmath1 meson , the odd moments for both of the two twist-3 distribution amplitudes ( see definition in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) ) are zero due to conservation of charge parity and isospin symmetry",
    ". however , the odd moments for @xmath11 meson do not vanish when including su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects .    the structure of this paper is as below : after this introduction , we derive the general sum rules of moments for twist-3 distribution amplitudes of scalar mesons in section [ form ]",
    ". then we will give the inputs used in our work and present the numerical results of the first two moments for the above three scalar mesons in section [ resu ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in the valence quark model , there are two twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes for scalar mesons which are defined as @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the momentum fraction carried by the @xmath16 quark in the scalar meson . here the scalar density meson decay constant @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "this scalar decay constant @xmath19 can be connected with the vector current decay constant @xmath20 which is defined as @xmath21 : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the mass of @xmath26 , @xmath16 and scalar meson respectively .",

    "now we are ready to calculate the moments of the two twist-3 distribution amplitudes defined in eq .",
