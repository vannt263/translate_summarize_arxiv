    "however in going to microscopic models one usually loses the mathematical simplicity of the continuum approach .",
    "step flow models and monte carlo simulations are usually solved numerically and it is difficult to derive the large scale dynamics from them .    the second way is to use continuum models in which singular points are treated as moving @xcite or stationary @xcite boundaries .",
    "alternatively , surface tension singularities can be smoothed out @xcite assuming that if smoothing is done on a small length scale the large scale results will not be affected .",
    "the drawback of these continuum approaches is that by starting with a continuum model one loses sight of the underlying microscopic kinetics .",

    "( [ ndl_scaling_eq ] ) and ( [ dl_scaling_eq ] ) numerically . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] we show the results for a single slope - up region of the profile in the adl case and compare them with the simulation data .",
    "the slope - down regions of the profile behave in exactly the same way , but with a negative step density ( to be consistent with the profile slope ) . in the insets",
    "we show the surface profile , which is obtained by integrating the scaling function over alternating regions of steps and antisteps .",
    "similar results were obtained in the dl case .    the following picture emerges .",
    "both in the adl and dl cases , when step - antistep attraction is absent ( @xmath49 ) the unique scaling solutions , which satisfy all the boundary conditions , have no facets .",
    "the scaling functions obey eqs.([ndl_scaling_eq ] ) and ( [ dl_scaling_eq ] ) in the entire interval @xmath147 and are finite at the profile extrema ( @xmath148 ) . this results in cusp - like peaks and valleys in the surface profile .",
    "the agreement between the scaling functions and the simulation data is excellent in these cases .",
    "when step - antistep attraction is present ( @xmath149 ) the situation is different .",
    "the unique scaling solutions , which satisfy all the boundary conditions , have small facets near the profile extrema . in the facet region",
    "the scaling functions are identically zero and as a result the profiles have flat peaks and valleys .",
    "here we also have good agreement with simulation data , but not as good as in the @xmath49 cases .",
    "this is because the scaling ansatz is a better approximation when @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we test our model against experimental results .",
    "specifically we compare our predictions with afm measurements carried out by tanaka et al@xcite .",
    "they measured the amplitude of decaying 1d silicon gratings fabricated on a surface vicinal to the si(001 ) plane .",
    "they report an exponential decay of the surface amplitude with life times scaling as the fourth power of the grating wavelength .",
    "the observed profiles had flat peaks and valleys .",
    "these results qualitatively resemble the behavior of our model in the ndl case in the presence of step - antistep attraction .    to prepare the ground for a more quantitative comparison ,",
    "let us first discuss the relevance of our model to the experimental system .",
    "the experimental conditions where such that the si surface was below its roughening transition .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect step - dominated surface kinetics .",
    "however , the step structure in the experiment is different from the idealized one dimensional array of straight steps we considered in our model .",
    "since the grating was fabricated on a vicinal surface , with the grooves direction perpendicular to the unperturbed steps , the steps are not straight .",
    "this can be easily shown by writing the surface profile as @xmath150 here @xmath151 is the one dimensional periodic profile along the @xmath152 axis and @xmath153 is the two dimensional surface profile .",
    "the parameter @xmath154 measures the slope of the original vicinal surface with respect to the high symmetry @xmath155 plane .",
    "the constant height contours which define the steps are given by @xmath156 evidently , we deal here with curved steps , a fact which complicates surface dynamics .",
    "this situation was studied by bonzel and mullins @xcite who investigated the smoothing of perturbed vicinal surfaces .",
    "in addition to step - step interactions , step motion is also driven by the steps line tension , @xmath157 .",
    "this is reflected by the addition of a term @xmath158 to the step chemical potential , where @xmath159 is the local radius of curvature of the @xmath7th step .",
    "the above arguments suggest that our straight steps model can not describe surface dynamics in regions where line tension is important . to justify the application of our model to the experimental system",
    "we must therefore show that we can neglect the effect of step line tension .",
    "we do this by considering the scaling limit of the system .",
    "we show that in this limit the steps in the sloping parts of the profile are effectively straight .",
    "the only regions where step curvature is significant are the profile extrema , where our continuum model is not valid anyway . unlike bonzel and mullins we consider situations where step curvature is a driving force for step straightening only at the profile extrema .",
    "assume now that the step system ( [ experimental_steps ] ) exhibits scaling and obeys eq .",
    "( [ scaling_ansatz ] ) .",
    "@xmath160 is the step density along the @xmath152 axis . under these assumptions",
    "we can express the step curvature contribution to the chemical potential as @xmath161^{3/2 } } = -\\frac{\\gamma \\alpha f'}{a \\left(1+\\frac{\\alpha^2 f^2}{a^2}\\right)^{3/2}}\\ ; , \\label{curvature}\\ ] ] with primes denoting derivatives with respect to @xmath152 .",
    "note that according to eq .",
    "( [ curvature ] ) , @xmath162 is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "let us estimate the effect of @xmath163 on step kinetics .",
    "this chemical potential gives rise to surface currents parallel and perpendicular to the steps .",
    "the divergence of these currents contributes to the step velocities . along a step",
    "we can estimate the resulting current as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the step arclength .",
    "the contribution of this current to the step velocity is proportional to @xmath166 in the scaling limit @xmath75 , this contribution decays as @xmath167 wherever @xmath5 is finite .",
    "this result should be compared with the step velocities of the original model . using the expansion eq .",
    "( [ x_expansion ] ) , we can expand the original step velocities , eq .",
    "( [ velocities1 ] ) , in @xmath64 .",
    "the outcome of this manipulation is a velocity of order @xmath168 .",
    "thus , in the scaling limit , the curvature driven current along the steps results in a negligible contribution to the step velocities .",
    "the current perpendicular to a step is proportional to the chemical potential difference between two adjacent steps .",
    "this can be estimated from @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a unit vector perpendicular to the step . however , since we are only interested here in the leading order in @xmath64 , we can make the approximation @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 wherever @xmath5 does not vanish .",
    "the contribution of these currents to the step velocity is consequently proportional to the current difference between two adjacent terraces which we estimate as @xmath174 again this contribution in negligible in the scaling limit .",
    "the above argument relies on the fact that in the sloping parts of the profile @xmath5 is finite .",
    "this is of course not true near the profile extrema .",
    "step curvature is therefore important at the facets near the profile peaks and valleys where the scaling function @xmath5 is identically zero .",
    "thus , we can divide the system into two types of regions : the sloping parts where our continuum model is valid and the facets where our continuum model breaks down .",
    "recall however that our model breaks down on facets in any case , and we solve the model only on the sloping parts of the profile .",
    "the kinetics of the annihilating steps on the facets enters the continuum model only through the life time of the profile , which we have to take from the discrete step system .",
    "we can use this strategy here , i.e. , by measuring the life time of the profile from the experimental results we can predict ( using eq .  ( [ ndl_scaling_eq ] ) ) the density scaling function .",
    "alternatively , by fitting the scaling function to the experiment we can make a connection between the experimental life time @xmath175 , and the microscopic parameters of the system . in fig.[figure6 ] we show a comparison between a snapshot of the normalized experimental slope and the best fit solution of eq.([ndl_scaling_eq ] ) .",
    "this solution corresponds to a life time @xmath176 in dimensionless units . according to eq.([ndl_dimensionless_vars ] ) the three microscopic parameters @xmath11 , @xmath24 and @xmath177",
    "satisfy @xmath178 the parameter values for the experimental data of fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] are @xmath179 , @xmath180 minutes and @xmath181 .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] shows good agreement between theory and experiment it does not by itself provide enough evidence for scaling in the experimental system . to verify that the experimental system scales in time one must analyze several snapshots of the surface slope taken at different times .",
    "however , the fit quality and the fact that the surface amplitude decays exponentially with a life time proportional to the fourth power of the grating wavelength , strongly suggest scaling .",
    "in this work we have studied the relaxation process of one dimensional surface modulations below the roughening transition temperature .",
    "simulations of a step flow model suggest that the _ discrete _ step density function , @xmath0 , exhibits scaling throughout most of the decay process , for a wide range of the model parameters , spanning dl to adl kinetics and a range of strengths of the attraction between steps of opposite sign .    relying on the above observations",
    ", we then transformed the discrete step model into a continuum model for surface dynamics .",
    "this was done using the scaling ansatz @xmath1 , and we were able to write down the differential equations for the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these equations were derived directly from the discrete step equations of motion .",
    "we showed that they are exact in the scaling limit .",
    "we investigated the boundary conditions for the scaling function @xmath5 and found @xmath5 numerically .",
    "a comparison between the resulting solutions and density functions from simulations of the discrete step model shows impressive agreement .",
    "finally , we applied our continuum model to experimental data measured by tanaka et al@xcite .",
    "they reported exponential amplitude decay of si(001 ) gratings and profiles with flat peaks and valleys . in their experiment",
    "the profile life times scaled as the fourth power of the grating wavelength .",
    "these properties resemble the behavior of our model in the ndl case with step - antistep attraction .",
    "we showed that in the scaling limit , our one dimensional model is adequate in spite of the fact that the steps in the experimental system are not straight .",
    "we compared the best fit solution of our model to a normalized snapshot of the experimental profile slope and found good agreement .",
    "on the basis of this agreement we suggested that the profile exhibits scaling and made a connection between the measured profile life time and microscopic system parameters .",
    "we now discuss the main aspects of our results and put them in perspective with existing work . in the scaling limit",
    "our continuum model is an exact result of step kinetics .",
    "we showed that the resulting general differential equations ( ( [ ndl_general_eq ] ) and ( [ dl_general_eq ] ) ) are equivalent to existing phenomenological models@xcite , thereby confirming that these models are consistent with step flow .",
    "although we have not discussed this issue here , it can be shown that the scaling solutions @xmath1 are linearly stable solutions of the general differential equations ( ( [ ndl_general_eq ] ) and ( [ dl_general_eq ] ) ) .",
    "this fact may explain why scaling solutions are selected .",
    "however , our analysis shows that these differential equations have corrections which originate from the discrete nature of the system .",
    "when these corrections are important , one must take into account the full expansion series ( [ x_expansion ] ) .",
    "this results in differential equations of infinite order . therefore eqs .",
    "( [ ndl_general_eq ] ) & ( [ dl_general_eq ] ) and other equivalent models are valid only in situations where corrections can be ignored .",
    "we proved that the scaling scenario is such a case by showing how these corrections vanish in the scaling limit .",
    "the second point we emphasize is that even in a scaling limit there are regions where the discrete nature of steps becomes important .",
    "such regions are the profile extrema where step - antistep pairs annihilate .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first , the steps near the profile extrema are unique in the sense that they have a neighboring step of opposite sign . they therefore follow unique equations of motion .",
    "this does not enter in our continuum model which treats all steps on equal footing .",
    "secondly , our continuum model breaks down near zeros of the scaling function .",
    "this can be seen in the derivation of the model , which relies on @xmath5 being finite .",
    "the kinetics of steps in regions where the step density vanishes are not described by the model , since corrections to the scaling function become important there . in cases where the profile extrema are faceted ,",
    "our continuum model can not account for the kinetics of steps on the facets even if these steps follow the general discrete equations of motion .",
    "it is therefore obvious that our continuum model ( and all other equivalent differential equations ) does not constitute a complete description of surface evolution .",
    "a manifestation of this statement is the fact that the relative attraction strength , @xmath182 , is not a parameter of the continuum model , even though it strongly affects surface evolution .",
    "since our continuum model breaks down near the profile extrema , their effect must be taken into account by supplying additional information .",
    "in our case , this information is the value of the profile life time . as we showed in section iv",
    ", this life time determines the annihilation rate of step - antistep pairs and can be considered as the last boundary condition required for finding the scaling function .",
    "thus , in a scaling scenario , the effect of step kinetics near the profile extrema reduces to a boundary condition for the scaling function at @xmath108 . in order to solve for @xmath5 consistently with the discrete model , it is sufficient to supply the profile life time .",
    "we did this by measuring the life times of the discrete systems .    in this respect",
    "our work is different from other continuum treatments of modulated surfaces .",
    "as pointed out by chame et al@xcite , lack of consistency with the kinetics of facet steps is the weakness of existing continuum models .",
    "one remarkable outcome of these inconsistencies is the controversy regarding the appearance of facets at the profile extrema .",
    "ozdemir & zangwill@xcite and hager & spohn @xcite both used continuum models , which are equivalent to eq.([dl_general_eq ] ) .",
    "bonzel and preuss @xcite use a slightly different model in which the surface currents are proportional to the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to the surface arclength .",
    "but they all start from a continuum approach and do not specify the step kinetics on the facets .",
    "ozdemir and zangwill assume that eq.([dl_general_eq ] ) is valid in the full interval between the profile extrema and thus exclude the possibility of facet formation .",
    "their results show smooth ( but nonanalytic ) profiles .",
    "this corresponds to some weak attractive step - antistep interaction ( in the absence of such interaction we get cusped profiles ) .",
    "they showed that eq .",
    "( [ dl_general_eq ] ) admits shape preserving solutions , equivalent to our scaling solutions in the dl case .",
    "in particular they showed that the amplitude @xmath59 of a shape preserving profile obeys eq.([dl_alpha ] ) .",
    "our results for the decay rate in the dl case are mathematically identical , but we interpret them differently .",
    "while ozdemir and zangwill look at the long time limit in which @xmath183 , we recognize that eq .",
    "( [ dl_general_eq ] ) is valid only in the scaling limit , where @xmath184 . in this case @xmath185 .",
    "hager and spohn , on the other hand , allow for facet formation by solving eq .",
    "( [ dl_general_eq ] ) with moving boundaries .",
    "they assume that the chemical potential , the current and the current divergence are all continuous at the facet edge . in their model ,",
    "the chemical potential at the facet edge is not a step chemical potential .",
    "it is a _ layer _",
    "chemical potential which reflects the free energy change caused by the annihilation of the top step - antistep pair . in this way",
    "they allow for the top terraces to peel rapidly .",
    "their model produces facets which grow in time .",
    "our results are different .",
    "first , since we start from step flow , the chemical potential in our continuum model is a _ step _ chemical potential . on a facet",
    "our chemical potential is not defined ( and therefore not continuous ) since there are no steps there .",
    "one can argue that the adatom chemical potential on the facet is equal to the chemical potential of the top first step .",
    "but this first step is unique and is not treated by the continuum model .",
    "it is also far from equilibrium with its neighbors so there is no reason to assume continuity of the chemical potential .",
    "second , the appearance of facets in our model depends on strength of the step - antistep attraction .",
    "bonzel and preuss deal with facets differently .",
    "they round the cusp singularity of the surface tension , eq .",
    "( [ surface_tension ] ) , and apply the kinetic surface equation everywhere .",
    "they thus obtain analytic profiles with very flat extrema but without actual faceting . again",
    "the weakness of this approach is that it is not clear how this rounding is related to the microscopic behavior of steps .",
    "we conclude that our continuum model is fully consistent with step kinetics , but is restricted to scaling scenarios .",
    "it may serve both as a starting point and a test case , for new continuum models which will attempt to describe surface evolution in general and facet kinetics in particular .",
