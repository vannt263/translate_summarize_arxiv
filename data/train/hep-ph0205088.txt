    "a beautiful feature of flipped @xmath0 @xcite is that it provides a natural setting for the missing partner mechanism .",
    "this mechanism , when implemented in flipped @xmath0 , not only solves the doublet - triplet splitting problem but also allows one to avoid entirely the higgsino - mediated proton decay that is such a difficulty for supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) . on the other hand , flipped @xmath0 gives up one of the most attractive features of grand unification , namely unification of gauge couplings , because it is based on the group @xmath6 .",
    "another drawback of flipped @xmath0 models is that the masses of down quarks and charged leptons come from different operators , so that one does not obtain the relation @xmath7 .",
    "the unification of gauge couplings and relations between down quark masses and charged lepton masses could be recovered by embedding the group @xmath6 in the simple group @xmath1 . however , in that case , the missing partner mechanism no longer works , since the partner that was missing from the @xmath0 multiplets is present in the larger @xmath1 multiplets .",
    "one thus has somewhat of a quandary .",
    "the point of this paper is that a way out of this quandary is provided by unification in five dimensions .",
    "we show that if the group @xmath1 in five dimensions is broken by orbifold compactification to the group @xmath6 in four dimensions it is possible to have at the same time the good features of both flipped @xmath0 and of @xmath1 .",
    "the essential reason is that if @xmath1 is broken by the orbifold compactification then the fields of the effective four - dimensional theory need not be in complete @xmath1 multiplets .",
    "this means that at the four - dimensional level the famous missing partners can still be missing and the doublet - triplet splitting can be achieved without the dangerous higgsino - mediated proton decay . on the other hand , because there is @xmath1 at the five - dimensional level , there is approximate unification of gauge couplings , and there is also the possibility of getting @xmath1-like yukawa couplings for the quarks and leptons .",
    "by now there are many models that use orbifold compactification of extra dimensions to break grand unified symmetries .",
    "the first such models @xcite showed that with one extra dimension it is possible to construct @xmath0 models which have natural doublet - triplet splitting and no problem with the @xmath2 proton decay operators that plague four - dimensional susy guts .",
    "the breaking of grand unified symmetries by orbifold compactification of a single extra dimension does not reduce the rank of the group @xcite .",
    "thus to break @xmath1 all the way to the standard model by orbifold compactification requires at least two extra dimensions .",
    "interesting six - dimensional @xmath1 models have been constructed in several papers @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible that the breaking from the grand unified group to the standard model is achieved by a combination of orbifold compactification and the conventional four - dimensional higgs mechanism . that allows the construction of realistic @xmath1 models with only a single extra dimension , as was shown by derm ' iek and mafi @xcite .",
    "in their model the theory in the five - dimensional bulk has @xmath8 supersymmetry and gauge group @xmath1 .",
    "orbifolding breaks @xmath1 to the pati - salam @xcite symmetry @xmath9 .",
    "the orbifold has two inequivalent fixed points @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "on @xmath10 there is a full @xmath1 symmetry , but on @xmath11 only the pati - salam group . on the brane at @xmath10",
    "the conventional higgs mechanism breaks @xmath1 down to @xmath0 .",
    "thus the unbroken symmetry in the low - energy theory in four dimensions is the intersection of @xmath0 and the pati - salam group , i.e. the standard model group .",
    "the model we shall present is similar in some ways to that of derm ' iek and mafi but differs from it in several important respects . whereas they use orbifold compactification to break to the pati - salam group and higgs fields on the brane @xmath10 to break to @xmath0 , we shall use orbifold compactification to break to @xmath6 and higgs fields in the bulk to break the rest of the way to the standard model .",
    "they use orbifold breaking to split the doublets from the triplets , whereas we use the four - dimensional flipped-@xmath0 missing partner mechanism .",
    "before we consider higher dimensional theories we shall briefly review the missing partner mechanism in four - dimensional theories , showing why it works in flipped @xmath0 but not in @xmath1 .",
    "first recall what happens in ordinary ( i.e. georgi - glashow ) @xmath0 @xcite . in ordinary @xmath0",
    "the two higgs doublets of the mssm , which we shall denote @xmath12 and @xmath13 , have color - triplet partners , which we shall denote @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "( we use this shorthand notation for standard model representations : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . ) these are contained in fundamental and anti - fundamental multiplets of @xmath0 : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a combination of an @xmath0-singlet mass term and a yukawa coupling to a higgs in the adjoint representation , can ( with suitable fine - tuning ) give gut - scale mass to the triplet partners while leaving the mssm higgs doublets light .",
    "this can be represented schematically as    ( 6,1.4 ) ( 2.8,1.165)(1,0)0.42    where the solid horizontal line represents a large dirac mass @xmath4 connecting the colored higgsinos @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is well - known that the exchange of these colored higgsinos gives a dangerous @xmath2 proton - decay operator , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dimension5 ] . from the figure",
    "one sees that this proton decay amplitude is proportional to the mass connecting @xmath14 to @xmath15 . suppressing this proton decay",
    "therefore requires severing this connection .",
    "this can be done by introducing an extra pair of higgs multiplets @xmath22 , so that the triplets in the unprimed multiplets get mass not with each other but with the triplets in the primed multiplets as shown in the following diagram    ( 6,1.4 ) ( 2.20,1.165)(1,0)0.41 ( 3.35,1.165)(1,0)0.41 ( 2.76,0.89)(0.09,0)5(1,0)0.04 ( 2.76,1.165)(0.09,0)5(1,0)0.04    if the mssm higgs doublets are the unprimed ones , then one sees that their colored partners are not connected to each other by a mass term , so that the @xmath2 proton - decay amplitude vanishes .",
    "unfortunately , however , there is an extra pair of doublets that remains light , namely the primed ones .",
    "the effect of these on the renormalization group equations would destroy gauge coupling unification . to give the needed superheavy mass to these doublets",
    "one could introduce a term @xmath23 ; however , this would give mass terms connecting not only @xmath24 to @xmath12 but also @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( indicated by dotted lines in the previous diagram ) and thus indirectly ( after the primed triplets were integrated out ) reconnecting @xmath14 to @xmath15 and bringing back the dangerous @xmath2 proton decay amplitude .",
    "now let us turn to flipped @xmath0 and see how it avoids these problems very elegantly @xcite .",
    "in flipped @xmath0 models one has higgs fields in the following representations of @xmath6 : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . under the standard model group",
    "these decompose as follows , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the higgs superpotential contains the terms @xmath35 .",
    "when the standard model singlets @xmath36 in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) they break @xmath6 down to the standard model group and they also give mass to the triplet higgs .",
    "schematically ,    ( 6,1.4 ) ( 1.95,1.165)(1,0)0.55 ( 3.47,1.165)(1,0)0.55 ( 3,0.7)(0,0.2)4(0,1)0.1    where , for simplicity , @xmath39 .",
    "the triplets in @xmath40 and @xmath41 get mass with those in @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however the doublets in @xmath40 and @xmath41 remain massless because there are no doublets in @xmath37 and @xmath38 for them to mate with  thus the name  missing partner mechanism \" .    at first glance",
    "one might worry that the same problem arises here as in the ordinary @xmath0 case discussed previously .",
    "the multiplets @xmath42 and @xmath43 there played the same role as the multiplets @xmath37 and @xmath38 here .",
    "and we saw that one could not give mass to the doublets in @xmath42 and @xmath43 without reintroducing the dangerous proton decay amplitude .",
    "this leads to the question whether there is not an analogous difficulty in giving mass to some of the components of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and specifically to the @xmath44 , since here also an explicit mass term @xmath45 would reintroduce the problem of proton decay .",
    "the beautiful answer is that these  other \" components of @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not have to get mass . indeed , they _ must not _ get mass , because they are the goldstone modes that get eaten when @xmath6 breaks to @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , the fact that @xmath6 breaks to the standard model group guarantees that there is no mass connecting @xmath37 and @xmath38 and therefore guarantees the absence of the @xmath2 proton decay amplitude .",
    "now let us see why embedding flipped @xmath0 in @xmath1 in four dimensions destroys the beautiful missing partner solution to the doublet - triplet splitting and proton decay problems that we have just reviewed .    in @xmath1",
    "the simplest possibility is that the terms @xmath35 come from the terms @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the problem is that the doublet partners that were missing from @xmath37 and @xmath38 are now present in @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the terms @xmath55 contain not only @xmath56 but also @xmath57 .",
    "these latter terms mate the doublet higgs in @xmath40 and @xmath41 with those in @xmath53 and @xmath54 , destroying the solution of the doublet - triplet splitting problem .",
    "a possible remedy to this difficulty suggests itself .",
    "one can have @xmath40 and @xmath41 come from different @xmath58s of @xmath1 .",
    "let us examine what happens in this case , since it will be directly relevant to what we shall do in five dimensions later .",
    "suppose there are two vector higgs representations , denoted @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with couplings @xmath61 .",
    "we write @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "suppose that the two light doublets of the mssm lie in @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; then the triplet partners of these light doublets will obtain mass from the terms @xmath66 .",
    "the terms that give superlarge mass to doublets , and which correspond to those we found troubling before , are @xmath67",
    ". these do _ not _ give superlarge mass to the mssm doublets , but to the doublets in @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we would appear to have satisfactory doublet - triplet splitting with no dangerous @xmath2 proton decay , just as in flipped @xmath0 .",
    "however , this is not so , for the question arises how the triplets in @xmath68 and @xmath69 are to acquire superheavy mass .",
    "it would seem that the only way is through a mass term connecting them .",
    "but that would have to come from a term @xmath70 , which in turn comes from @xmath71 , and this would also give @xmath72 and thus superlarge mass to the mssm doublets .",
    "we see , then , that the missing partner mechanism does not work in four - dimensional @xmath1 theories . however , we shall see that it can work in five - dimensional @xmath1 theories",
    ". the crucial difference will be that orbifold breaking of @xmath1 can split the @xmath1 higgs representations .",
    "in particular , in the example we just looked at the troublesome triplets in @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be given kaluza - klein masses by the orbifold compactification while leaving the mssm doublets in @xmath64 and @xmath65 light .",
    "we now present an @xmath1 supersymmetric model in five dimensions compactified on an @xmath73 orbifold that yields a realistic supersymmetric flipped @xmath0 model in four dimensions .",
    "the breaking of @xmath6 down to the standard model gauge group , the doublet - triplet splitting , and the solution to the problem of @xmath2 proton - decay operators will all be as in conventional four - dimensional flipped @xmath0 models",
    ". moreover , there will be distinctive flipped @xmath0 relationships among gaugino masses",
    ". however , the gauge couplings will be unified ( with some threshold corrections , that can be argued to be small @xcite ) because of the underlying five - dimensional @xmath1 symmetry . and the yukawa couplings of the quarks and leptons can have relationships that are similar to what is found in ordinary @xmath0 and @xmath1 models rather than in flipped @xmath0 .    as already elaborated in refs .",

    "we assume that the @xmath37 and @xmath38 acquire superlarge vacuum expectation values that break @xmath6 down to the standard model group .",
    "the tree - level scalar potential generated by the terms @xmath191 is flat in this direction .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , this flatness can be lifted by radiative effects after supersymmetry is broken .",
    "it is also possible that additional terms in the higgs superpotential on the visible brane can lead to a tree - level superpotential that produces the required symmetry breaking , as we shall see later .",
    "besides breaking the gauge symmetry from @xmath6 down to @xmath46 , the vacuum expectation values of the fields @xmath192 and @xmath193 allow masses for the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "such masses come from effective operators of the form @xmath194",
    ". however , this product of fields has charge @xmath195 under the symmetry @xmath179 .",

    "it must be broken in such a way as to permit sufficiently large right - handed neutrino masses without at the same time allowing too large a @xmath176 parameter ( which is the coefficient of the term @xmath196 ) .",
    "this can be done in the following way ( which we do not claim to be unique ) .",
    "suppose that there are fields @xmath197 and @xmath198 living on the brane at @xmath10 that are singlets under @xmath1 and that have @xmath179 charges @xmath180 and @xmath199 respectively .",
    "in the superpotential on the brane at @xmath10 there can be terms of the form @xmath200 , where @xmath201 , with @xmath202 .",
    "these terms force @xmath203 .",
    "let us suppose that on the brane at @xmath10 there are , in addition to the quark and lepton families in @xmath148 , some leptons @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) that are @xmath1 singlets but have charge @xmath199 under @xmath179 .",
    "then the following terms in the superpotential at @xmath10 are possible : @xmath206 , where the dimensionless coefficients @xmath207 and @xmath208 are assumed to be of order one .",
    "the mass @xmath209 is an ultraviolet cutoff that specifies the scale at which new physics ( eg .",
    "other dimensions beyond five , strings ) become important .",
    "we take @xmath209 to be close to @xmath183 but , of course , somewhat larger .",
    "these terms give a mass matrix for the neutrinos that has the form @xmath210 where @xmath211 .",
    "( note that we have taken @xmath212 . )",
    "it is clear that the six superheavy neutrinos have masses of order @xmath213 , whereas the three light ( left - handed ) neutrinos have masses of order @xmath214 .",
    "taking the largest neutrino mass @xmath215 to be about @xmath216 ev , as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino data , and its dirac mass to be @xmath217 gev , as suggested by the relation @xmath218 ( which would hold in a minimal @xmath1 model ) , one has that @xmath219 gev .",
    "this accords well with the assumption that @xmath209 is slightly larger than the gut scale @xmath85 gev .",
    "the reason that we have assumed that the parameter @xmath220 is much smaller than one is that it suppresses certain dangerous operators . for example , @xmath179 allows the effective operator @xmath221 .",
    "this gives a @xmath2 proton decay operator with coefficient of order @xmath222 .",
    "sufficient suppression of proton decay requires that @xmath223 to @xmath182 .",
    "similarly , @xmath179 allows the operator @xmath224 .",
    "this gives a @xmath176 parameter for the mssm doublet higgs fields that is of order @xmath225 . requiring that this be no larger than the weak scale",
    "requires that @xmath226 be less than about @xmath227 .",
    "this corresponds to right - handed neutrino masses of order @xmath228 gev .",
    "such intermediate mass scales for @xmath229 are good from the point of view of leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the same singlet higgs field @xmath197 can play a role in generating the vacuum expectation value for the spinor higgs fields @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "such vevs , as we have already noted , can arise due to radiative effects after susy breaking .",
    "but they can also arise at tree level from a term in the superpotential on the brane at @xmath10 of the form @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is a singlet superfield with @xmath179 charge of @xmath181 , and @xmath232 .",
    "note that the @xmath233-terms of the fields @xmath104 and @xmath105 force @xmath234 , meaning that there is no mass term linking @xmath105 to @xmath104 and thus @xmath38 to @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath179 charge assignments allow the higher dimensional term @xmath235 .",
    "this will shift the vev of @xmath231 , but the @xmath233-terms of the fields @xmath104 and @xmath105 still enforce the condition that there is no mass term linking @xmath105 to @xmath104 .",
    "let us now examine the doublet - triplet splitting and proton decay problems .",
    "the terms @xmath236 will couple the triplets in @xmath64 and @xmath65 to those in @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the doublets in @xmath64 and @xmath65 remain light and are the two doublets of the mssm .",
    "there is no problem with @xmath2 proton decay , because the triplet partners of the mssm higgs doublets are not connected to each other .",
    "the triplets in @xmath64 and @xmath37 have no mass terms with the triplets in @xmath65 and @xmath38 . moreover , there are no unwanted light states contained in the higgs multiplets @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . in the zero modes ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) , the doublets remain light , the triplets become superheavy by coupling to the vevs of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the other gauge - non - singlet fields",
    "get eaten by the higgs mechanism when @xmath6 breaks to the standard model group .",
    "all the non - zero modes , of course , have superheavy kaluza - klein masses .",
    "this is the crucial difference with four - dimensional theories in which flipped @xmath0 is embedded in @xmath1 . in four dimensions ,",
    "as we saw in the last section , the @xmath1 higgs multiplets @xmath102 and @xmath103 when decomposed under @xmath6 contain not only @xmath64 and @xmath65 but also @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; and these multiplets have triplets that can not be given mass without destroying the gauge hierarchy . here , however , these extra pieces are all made heavy by the orbifold compactification , since they do not have parity @xmath125 .",
    "thus it is the fact that the unification of @xmath6 into @xmath1 occurs only in higher dimensions that allows the missing partner mechanism to be implemented .",
    "we have seen that with what may be called the minimal yukawa couplings @xmath237 this model gives distinctive relations among mass matrices that are different from those that result in four dimensional models with minimal yukawa couplings in either @xmath1 or flipped @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 , with all these matrices being symmetric .",
    "this does give the desired relation @xmath240 at the unification scale , a result of the fact that flipped @xmath0 is embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "however , this minimal set of yukawa terms is clearly not enough to give a realistic model of quark and lepton masses .",
    "recently it has been found that realistic and simple models of quark and lepton masses can be constructed using so - called  lopsided \" mass matrices @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of such models is that the mass matrices of the down quarks and charged leptons are highly asymmetric and that @xmath241 .",
    "such a relationship between @xmath171 and @xmath242 is typical of models with an ordinary @xmath0 , not flipped @xmath0 .",
    "however , as we shall now see , because the flipped @xmath0 is here embedded in @xmath1 at the five - dimensional level , it is possible to obtain such a lopsided structure .",
    "suppose that one introduces on the visible brane not only spinors of quarks and leptons , but @xmath1 vectors as well . and",
    "suppose that there is in the bulk a spinor higgs field @xmath243 that has a weak - doublet component that contributes to the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "then a diagram like that shown in fig .",
    "[ masses](a ) may be possible .",
    "when decomposed under the @xmath6 subgroup , this diagram contains the two diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ masses](b ) and [ masses](c ) .",
    "it is easy to see that these give contributions to @xmath171 and @xmath172 that are asymmetric and that are transposes of each other , just as needed to build  lopsided \" models .",
    "the reason for this is that the diagram in fig .",
    "[ masses](a ) directly depends only on the gut - scale breaking done by the @xmath104 and not on that coming from orbifold compactification .",
    "the point is that the @xmath104 vev by itself would only break @xmath1 down to the georgi - glashow @xmath0 .",
    "( it is the orbifold compactification that breaks @xmath1 to the flipped @xmath6 group . )",
    "that is why this diagram leads to the kind of mass contributions that one expects from ordinary georgi - glashow @xmath0 .",
    "this reasoning also shows that in order to introduce into the mass matrices contributions that break georgi - glashow @xmath0 it is necessary that the mass - splittings produced by the orbifold compactification be involved .",
    "for example , by mixing quarks and leptons that are on the visible brane with quarks and leptons in the bulk , it should be possible to break the ( bad ) minimal @xmath0 relations @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "in this section we address the issue of how to break @xmath8 supersymmetry of our model below the compactification scale @xmath95 .",
    "as it turns out , the solution allows the construction of viable susy breaking model that can easily satisfy present experimental constraints .",
    "it is well known that the models with visible and hidden branes separated by extra dimension(s ) naturally accommodate breaking of supersymmetry via gaugino mediation @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind gaugino mediation in the models based on the orbifold compactification is as follows .",
    "the source of the susy breaking is localized at the hidden brane .",
    "it couples directly to the gauginos at that brane providing them with nonzero masses .",
    "if the gauge symmetry at the hidden brane is reduced with respect to the bulk gauge symmetry this coupling induces non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "for example , if the bulk symmetry is @xmath1 and hidden brane symmetry is flipped @xmath0 one obtains @xmath246 . here ,",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 represent gaugino masses of the mssm .    following in the footsteps of @xcite",
    ", we take the source of the susy breaking to be a flipped @xmath0 singlet chiral superfield @xmath247 localized on the hidden brane with the vev @xmath248 the gaugino masses originate from the non - renormalizable operators at the hidden brane of the form @xmath249",
    "\\int{{\\rm d}^2\\theta}\\big(\\lambda_5^\\prime\\frac{z}{m^2_*}w^{i\\alpha } w^i_\\alpha+\\lambda_1^\\prime\\frac{z}{m^2_*}w^\\alpha w_\\alpha+{\\rm h.c.}\\big),\\ ] ] where the first and the second term under the integral represent the @xmath0 and @xmath250 part of the gauge group respectively .",
    "corresponding gaugino masses generated in this way are @xmath251 which translates into the following mssm gaugino masses ( we normalize the generators of @xmath1 demanding that @xmath252 ) @xmath253 here @xmath254 , and @xmath255 are gauge coupling constants of the @xmath0 and @xmath250 gauge groups respectively , while @xmath256 represents the @xmath257 gauge coupling constant of the standard model ( normalized as in guts ) .",
    "the relations of eq .",
    "( [ gauginos1 ] ) , which is valid at the compactification scale @xmath95 , show that the gaugino mass @xmath3 can in general be completely different from the mass @xmath258 due to their different origins .",
    "namely , the mass @xmath3 is dominated by the @xmath250 sector of the theory as oppose to the masses @xmath5 and @xmath4 that have their origin in the @xmath0 part of the theory .",
    "we will later see that this feature of non - universality of gaugino masses allows the construction of the theory of susy breaking that leads to the realistic mass spectrum .",
    "at this point we note that the natural scale for @xmath259 is the cutoff scale @xmath260 .",
    "( for the reasons that have to do with gauge coupling unification we take @xmath261 gev@xmath262 gev@xmath263 @xcite . )",
    "this implies that masses in eq .",
    "( [ gauginos ] ) are close to the compactification scale @xmath95 if the dimensionless coefficients @xmath264 and @xmath265 are taken to be of order one .",
    "to obtain susy breaking masses that are in the tev range we need to decrease the value of @xmath266 in a way that does not involve any fine - tuning . to do that we propose to use the shining mechanism @xcite which can reduce the natural scale of @xmath266 by an exponential factor .",
    "the shining mechanism requires the existance of a source @xmath267 that is localized on the visible brane and a massive hypermultiplet in the bulk .",
    "the hypermultiplet of mass @xmath268 is taken to be a gauge singlet and has couplings with both the source and the superfield @xmath247 .",
    "these couplings can be arranged in a manner that leaves the superfield @xmath247 with the nonzero f - term @xmath269 after the massive hypermultiplet is integrated out @xcite .",
    "if the mass @xmath268 is taken to be of order @xmath260 the @xmath259 will be of order @xmath270 gev which gives desired tev scale masses for gauginos in eq .",
    "( [ gauginos ] ) .",
    "the matter fields in our model reside on the visible brane .",
    "thus , due to the spatial separation between the branes the soft susy breaking scalar masses and trilinear couplings are negligible at the compactification scale .",
    "this is good because the number of the soft susy breaking parameters one has to consider is reduced with respect to the usual set .",
    "there are two additional positive features of the gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking models with the non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "firstly , the renormalization group running of scalar masses and trilinear couplings between @xmath95 and electroweak scale is significantly affected by gaugino masses but these contributions , being flavor blind , do not cause any disastrous flavor violating effects .",
    "secondly , non - universality opens up the possibility for the deviation from the experimentally disfavored prediction of the models with universal gaugino mass of stau being the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "( the last statement holds for @xmath271 which is exactly the case we have . )",
    "the class of models with non - universal gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking has been studied in more details by baer et al .",
    "their numerical study of the allowed region of susy parameter space shows that viable models with acceptable mass spectrum and neutral lsp particle can be obtained .",
    "the study includes the case of completely independent @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 , as well as the case where @xmath3 is a definite linear combination ( determined by group theory ) of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "( the former case can be seen as a consequence of orbifold reduction of @xmath0 down to the standard model group on the hidden brane as in ref .",
    "@xcite and the latter one follows from the reduction of @xmath1 down to the pati - salam group as in ref .  @xcite . ) we have an intermediate scenario where @xmath3 is independent of @xmath5 and @xmath4 which are made equal due to the @xmath0 part of the flipped @xmath0 .",
    "( this possibility was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a six dimensional @xmath1 model . )",
    "it is not difficult to adapt the analysis of baer et al . to our model to conclude that for large enough @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath272 at the compactification scale @xmath95 a viable region of parameter space opens up regardless of @xmath273 value yielding realistic mass spectrum with the lsp being wino - like or a mixture of higgsino and bino .",
    "an example of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ region ] .    at the end",
    "we observe that if we had the case of @xmath1 being reduced on the hidden brane to the georgi - glashow @xmath0 with an extra @xmath250 symmetry we would not only be prevented from using the simple form of the missing partner mechanism but would also obtain universal gaugino masses @xmath274 .",
    "we have seen that by embedding a four - dimensional flipped @xmath0 model into a five - dimensional @xmath1 model the advantages of flipped @xmath0 can be maintained while avoiding its well - known drawbacks .",
    "the two main drawbacks are the loss of unification of gauge couplings and the loss of the possibility of relating down quark masses to charged lepton masses , and therefore of obtaining desirable predictions such as @xmath240 and realistic quark and lepton mass schemes such as those based on  lopsided \" mass matrices . by embedding @xmath6 in @xmath1 , the unification of gauge couplings",
    "is restored .",
    "there are corrections to this unification , coming for example from gauge kinetic terms on the hidden brane ; however , these have been argued to be small @xcite .",
    "the embedding in @xmath1 also yields relationships between the charged lepton and down quark mass matrices .",
    "we have also found that interesting patterns of quark and lepton masses are possible that are different from those encountered in four - dimensional grand unified theories , for example @xmath275 .",
    "embedding flipped @xmath0 in @xmath1 in four dimensions is well known to destroy the missing partner mechanism for doublet - triplet splitting , which is one of the most elegant features of flipped @xmath0 .",
    "however , when the unification in @xmath1 takes place in higher dimensions and the breaking to @xmath6 is achieved through orbifold compactification , then the missing partner mechanism can still operate , as we have shown .",
    "one of the advantages of the missing partner mechanism in flipped @xmath0 is that it kills the dangerous @xmath2 proton decay operators that plague supersymmetric grand unified theories .",
    "thus in extra dimensions it is possible to have the best of both worlds , the best of @xmath1 combined with the best of flipped @xmath0 .",
    "one of the distinctive predictions of the flipped @xmath0 scheme that we have presented is that the gaugino masses will have the pattern @xmath276 .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is independent of @xmath5 and @xmath4 allows a much larger viable region of parameter space for the mssm .",
