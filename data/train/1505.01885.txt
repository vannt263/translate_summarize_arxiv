    "double quantum dots are a model system for investigating the dynamics of electrons in a wide range of semiconductors @xcite .",
    "charge stability diagrams - obtained by measuring the conductance as a function of the carrier density on each quantum dot - reveal a wealth of information about charging energy , interdot coupling and cross gate coupling strength , making them an ideal way to probe charge rearrangments in quantum dots at high magnetic fields .",

[ fig1](d ) . at high magnetic field , the ll@xmath37 is well developed with the consequent closing of the band gap . therefore , in the _ _ v__=0 region",

    "the current is delocalized in the dot and a charge rearrangemet can be seen compared to the case at low _ b_-fields .",
    "note that the more fractured the disorder potential is ( meaning more existing electron / hole puddles ) the more pronounced the charge delocalization effect will be at high fields .",
    "as the back gate voltage ( @xmath9=8.61 v ) where all the measurements were carried out is near the charge neutrality point , it is expected the background potential fluctuations will play a role and give rise to electron - hole puddles formed in the qds @xcite .",
    "in this situation , our model can be readily adapted to explain the data . due to the closing of the energy gap at high enough magnetic fields , at the _ _ v__=0 region the dos is high and develops non - chiral channels which connect the puddles , as sketched in fig . [",
    "fig1](e ) .",
    "hence , the current can flow through the puddles _ via _ crossing the high dos non - chiral channels at the interface , thus making electrons no longer confined in a particular puddle but delocalized in a larger puddle , resulting in a smaller charging energy .",
    "here we point out that the field has to be high enough for the lls and edge states to be fully developed to close the energy gap . the threshold _",

    ", we observed the change in @xmath21 from _ _ b__=4 t to _ _",
    "b__= 10 t is larger than that in @xmath18 .",
    "this is expected , since @xmath18 is smaller than @xmath21 , indicating electrons tunnel through a larger localized state in qd@xmath5 and a smaller localized state in qd@xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the disorder potential in qd@xmath2 is more fractured than that in qd@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , at high _ b_-field the charge delocalization effect is more pronounced in qd@xmath2 than that in qd@xmath5 , giving rise to the larger _",
    "b_-dependent charging energy in qd@xmath2 . here",
    "we note that the gqd has to be large for the substrate disorder to play an important role , which may be the reason that the decreasing charging energy with _",
    "b_-field is not observed in other relatively smaller gqd with large edge - to - bulk ratio @xcite or gqd on hbn @xcite where substrate disorder is less important .",
    "the increasing interdot coupling energy may be also understood as the charges rearranging from the center of the puddles to the edge of the dot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( g)-(j ) ) .",
    "this scenario depends on the progressively formed edge state with increasing _",
    "b_-field , and can be observed in the whole range of _ b_-field ( fig . [",
    "fig4](d ) ) .",
    "a more recent study of gnr on hbn substrate has indicated that the localized states may also extend into the leads of the device , giving rise to smaller charging energies than expected from the geometry of gnr alone @xcite",
    ". however , two conditions are crucial for this effect to be seen .",
    "one is the substrate disorder has to be much weaker than the edge disorder , and the other is the edge - to - bulk ratio of device has to be large enough for the edge to play an important role .",
    "transport in gqds on hbn is dominated by the edge roughness for qds with diameter less than 100 nm @xcite .",
    "each condition is met by their relatively small gnr ( 30 nm @xmath3 30 nm ) on hbn , thus the edge disorder is strong enough to localize electron wavefunction along the edge to the leads .",
    "on the contrary , our large dot ( and the tunnel barrier gnr ) with smaller edge - to - bulk ratio should diminish the influence of the rough edges on overall transport , meaning localization along the edge still happens but transport is dominated by bulk contributions .",
    "therefore , we argue that the charge redistribution ( based on substrate disorder ) in our qds is the main factor that leads to a variation of dots area and contribute to the decreasing charging energies in magnetic fields .    the effect of disorder can be also seen in fig .",

    "a schematic illustration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( d ) and ( e ) to address such a scenario .",
    "when a localized state is formed in magnetic field , while the gate voltage is sweeped it can add or subtract charges discretely to the parasitic dot , thus altering the entire environment abruptly and unexpectedly .",
    "the fact that the splitting occurs on both gate spaces suggests the localized state can affect two dots in a similar way , implying its location is in the central gnr ( fig .",
