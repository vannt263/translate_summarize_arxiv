    "the _ systematic _ uncertainties in the determination of the ages , masses , and  to a lesser extent  extinction and metallicity of young extragalactic star clusters , based on broad - band imaging observations , but using a variety of analysis approaches are poorly understood .",
    "our aim in this paper is to intercompare the results obtained from _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations of carefully selected young star cluster samples using a variety of commonly used modelling techniques , and characterise the major differences among the techniques .",
    "we will do this specifically with respect to our own extensively tested multi - dimensional approach , which we will use as our main benchmark .      at one time or another during its lifetime",
    ", every galaxy will be affected by the external gravitational effects , however minor , exerted by its neighbour galaxies .",
    "irrespective of the precise interaction geometry , the results of such interactions are often striking : depending on the available gas reservoir , violent star formation will ensue , frequently predominantly in the guise of active star _ cluster",
    "_ formation ( e.g. , whitmore et al .",
    "1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a , b , and references therein ) .",
    "thus , where the above scenario holds , the age distribution of a galaxy s star cluster population reflects its violent interaction history .",
    "the study of young and intermediate - age star cluster systems in a variety of galactic environments out to @xmath3 mpc has become a major field in extragalactic astrophysics in recent years , significantly stimulated by the superb imaging quality of the _ hst_. one of the key diagnostic tools often utilised to predict the fate of such cluster systems is the cluster luminosity function ( clf ; based on broad - band imaging observations ) .",
    "significant age spreads in young cluster systems  which might still be undergoing active cluster formation  affect the observed clf ( meurer 1995 , fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1998 , 1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003b ) .",
    "this might , in fact , make an intrinsically log - normal clf appear as a power - law ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "1997 , fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1998 ) ; the exact shape of the intrinsic clf , whether a power law or a log - normal distribution , is still being debated ( e.g. , vesperini 2000 , 2001 , vs. fall & zhang 2001 ; see also lamers et al .",
    "it is obviously very important to obtain accurate age estimates for the individual clusters within such a system and to correct the observed clf to a common age , before interpreting it as an _ intrinsic _ clf ( fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003b ) .",
    "the metallicities of star clusters produced in the high - pressure environments of galaxy interactions , mergers and starbursts are an important discriminator against the old milky way - type globular clusters ( gcs ) , thought to be the oldest building blocks of most nearby spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are expected to correspond to the interstellar medium ( ism ) abundances of the interacting / starburst galaxies , and are therefore most likely significantly more metal - rich than those of halo gcs in the milky way and other galaxies with old gc systems .",
    "however , ism abundances span a considerable range among different galaxy types , from early - type spirals to dwarf irregulars ( e.g. , ferguson et al . 1998 ) , and may also exhibit significant radial gradients ( oey & kennicutt 1993 , zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 , richer & mccall 1995 ) . hence",
    ", a considerable metallicity range may be expected for star clusters produced in interactions of various types of galaxies and even among the clusters formed within one global galaxy - wide starburst .",
    "a significant increase of the ism abundance in massive gas - rich galaxies may occur during strong bursts ( fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben & gerhardt 1994 , their fig .",
    "at the same time , typically within a few @xmath4 yr , some fraction of the gas enriched by dying first - generation burst stars may well be shock - compressed to cool fast enough to be built into later generations of stars or clusters produced in the ongoing burst . the same effect",
    "may occur when multiple bursts occur in a series of close encounters between two or more galaxies before their final merger .",
    "precise ( relative ) metallicity determinations for individual young star clusters are not only important to address these issues , but also for the correct derivation of ages from broad - band colours or spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "dust extinction is often very important in young cluster systems .",
    "in particular the youngest post - starburst galaxies and galaxies with ongoing starbursts often show strong and patchy dust structures .",
    "for instance , the youngest clusters in the overlap region of the two galactic discs in the antennae galaxies are highly obscured in the optical and are best detected in near or mid - infrared observations ( mirabel et al .",
    "1998 , mengel et al . 2001 ) . similarly , lanon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discovered one of the most massive young star clusters in m82 based on near - infrared ( nir ) _ hst _ observations ; at optical wavelengths the cluster is completely obscured .",
    "older merger remnants like ngc 7252 or ngc 3921 seem to have blown their inner regions clear of all the gas and dust left over from intense star formation ( e.g. , schweizer et al .",
    "extinction estimates toward individual clusters are therefore as important as individual metallicity estimates in order to obtain reliable ages and masses .",
    "spectroscopy of individual massive young clusters , although feasible today with 8m - class telescopes for the nearest systems , is very time - consuming , since observations of large numbers of clusters are required to obtain statistically significant results .",
    "multi - passband imaging is a very interesting and useful alternative , in particular if it includes coverage of nir and/or ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths ( e.g. , de grijs et al .",
    "2003c , anders et al .",
    "there are obviously limitations to the accuracy of the cluster parameters derived from broad - band imaging observations ( e.g. , de grijs et al .",
    "2003b , c , anders et al .",
    "2004b , bastian et al . 2004 ) , but the _ relative _ overall characteristics derived for the cluster _ populations _ as a whole appear to be relatively robust .    in this paper",
    "we assess the systematic uncertainties in age and mass determinations , and to a lesser extent also in extinction and metallicity determinations , for young star cluster systems based on the use of broad - band , integrated colours , employing a variety of independently developed methods to analyse extragalactic star clusters as so - called `` simple stellar populations '' ( ssps ) : star clusters are the simplest objects to model , since they approximate single - age , single - metallicity populations with a range of stellar masses .",
    "stochastic sampling effects of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) also affect star cluster properties , in particular for low - mass objects .",
    "however , since they affect broad - band photometry to a smaller extent than spectroscopy , and because we are dealing here with high - mass clusters only , we will not include these effects in this paper .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to intercompare the results obtained for sets of well - calibrated cluster seds using a variety of commonly used modelling techniques , specifically with respect to our own extensively tested multi - dimensional approach ( see section [ method5.sec ] ) .    in order to determine the _ absolute _ systematic uncertainties caused by the intrinsic differences in the models and methods in use in the literature",
    ", we distributed sets of broad - band star cluster photometry ( described in section [ data.sec ] ) to representatives of the various groups active in this field , and requested them to derive the cluster parameters using their specific methodology , wherever the data allowed this to be done .",
    "the models and methods are described in section [ methods.sec ] ; we emphasize that most of the comparisons among methods done in this paper should be considered relative to the results obtained using the analysed method described in section [ method5.sec ] .",
    "we summarise the results from applying our analysed approach to a large grid of artificial cluster data in section [ artdata.sec ] , in order to establish the theoretical benchmark for further comparisons among approaches . in section [ comparison.sec ]",
    "we compare the overall , relative parameter distributions , while in section [ detailed.sec ] one - to - one comparisons between the various method+model combinations for the individual clusters in both of our samples are discussed ; the results from each of the methods used for both cluster samples are included in appendix a. we extend this discussion by considering the effects of converting the cluster photometry to different filter systems ( section [ filters.sec ] ) , and conclude the paper in section [ final.sec ] .",
    "the field of stellar population modelling using extragalactic compact star cluster systems has undergone a major expansion since high - resolution , well - calibrated _ hst _ observations became available to the community .",
    "the application of stellar population synthesis of galactic subcomponents has become almost trivial for galaxies within @xmath5 mpc , while star cluster population modelling is very well feasible out to @xmath6 mpc , at least for the brighter ( and therefore more massive ) clusters within a given cluster population ( see , e.g. , de grijs et al . [ 2003d ] and pasquali , de grijs & gallagher [ 2003 ] for examples toward and close to the distance limit ) .",
    "ongoing and future _ hst _ programmes will continue to provide high - resolution uv - optical - nir imaging of large samples of galaxies out to these distances .",
    "we therefore expect that modelling simple stellar populations and their broad - band seds will remain a key diagnostic tool for both the study of the evolution of extragalactic star cluster systems and their relation to milky way - type gcs , and for the analysis of galactic star formation and interaction histories .",
    "therefore , we decided to focus our comparison of models and methods on _ hst_-based imaging data .",
    "in addition , the calibration of _ hst _ measurements is well - understood and does , therefore , not introduce additional uncertainties as caused by , e.g. , temporal variations in the atmospheric transmission that one would have to deal with if ground - based observations were used .",
    "we selected subsamples from large populations of young star cluster systems extensively studied in the literature , which we required to be among the brighter members of their respective populations ( thus minimising the observational uncertainties ) , as well as spanning a large age range ( based on preliminary analyses , as described below ) .",
    "ideally , we would have preferred to select cluster samples for which both _ hst _",
    "measurements in a minimum of four broad - band passbands could be obtained , as well as independently determined parameters from spectroscopic observations .",
    "unfortunately , such data sets are yet not available , however .",
    "on the other hand , schweizer , seitzer & brodie ( 2004 ) recently showed convincingly that spectroscopic age determinations are not necessarily better or more accurate than photometrically obtained ages , at least in the age range from @xmath7 myr .      * ngc 3310 , a nearby spiral galaxy exhibiting dominant star cluster formation in a circumnuclear starburst ring .",
    "this galaxy was covered by _",
    "hst _ by the largest possible wavelenth range .",
    "the full set of eight broad - band stmag magnitudes for the @xmath8 clusters in the galaxy s centre ( located in the starburst ring and outside of it ) , from f300w ( `` mid - uv '' ) to f205w were published and analysed in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2003a , c ) .",
    "we selected 17 of these clusters for the present analysis , all with well - determined , high - quality photometry in the entire set of available passbands ( see table [ ngc3310.tab ] ) . + [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]"
