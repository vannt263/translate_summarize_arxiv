    "y@xmath1re@xmath2ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 was earlier investigated in most cases with the concentration @xmath6 about a few tens of atomic percents .",
    "it is found that the pinning depends on valence and size of re ions .",
    "the doping ions with valence 3 + do not change superconducting properties of ybco greatly unlike ions with larger valence @xcite .",
    "increasing of pinning in y@xmath1re@xmath2ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 films with small concentrations of re ( @xmath7 0.1 ) was observed in article @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite were interested mainly by a relative influence of different doping elements to the flux pinning .",
    "they found the pinning enhancement by a minute doping with different re especially tb and nd .",
    "the dependence of critical current density in polycrystalline y@xmath1pr@xmath2ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath8 on @xmath6 was investigated in article @xcite .",
    "the maximal critical current density was reached for @xmath6 = 0.08 .    to study the concentration dependence of pinning we suggest to choose @xmath6 connecting with parameters of the crystal structure .",
    "the concentration of re can be correlated with the average distance between impurity ions in the rare - earth plane , @xmath9 .",
