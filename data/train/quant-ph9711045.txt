    "the form of reductionism thus introduced turns out to be deeper than the classical one",
    ".    then we ask ourselves whether or not the feature is physical .",
    "the answer reached in this work is that it is physical as long as hermitean matrices can stand in place of hamiltonians .",

    "of course these gates differ from the gates used in the sequential approach , where inputs and outputs are successive states of the same register.@xmath86 } $ ]    the usual way of stating a problem with such a space - deployed network , is by constraining _",
    "part _ of the input and _ part _ of the output ( actually , there is no preferred input - output direction ) and asking whether this constrained network admits a solution .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be such partial constraints . @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) propagates a _ conditional _ logical implication from left to right ( right to left ) .",
    "the logical implication is conditioned by the possible values of the unconstrained part of the input ( output ) . in order to have a solution ,",
    "these two propagations must be matched , namely must generate a univocal set of values on all the nodes of the network @xmath0 of course comprising the unconstrained input / output nodes .",
    "finding whether the network admits at least one match ( one solution ) is an np - complete problem in general .",
    "naturally , it is the well known sat(satisfiability ) problem on a reversible boolean network .",
    "possible collisions ( mismatch ) between the two propagations will be both overcome and reconciled by the transmission , as it will become clear .",
    "let us assume that the network has just one solution ( which is the case here : @xmath89",
    "@xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath88 ) .",
    "the procedure to find it is as follows .",
    "the output constraint is removed while an arbitrary value , say @xmath93 , is assigned to the unconstrained part of the input .",
    "the logical propagation of this input toward the output yields @xmath93 , @xmath87 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 will be disregarded ) .",
    "this computation is performed off line in polynomial time .",

    "while @xmath102 is rotated , @xmath103 is kept fixed .",
    "this transformation operates on the network hilbert space @xmath104 defined as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "note that all states of @xmath104 already satisfy the gate , not necessarily the transmission .    at any time @xmath27",

    "@xmath108 3 .",
    "@xmath109 4 .",

    "this yields at time @xmath27 :    @xmath110 with @xmath54 , which is readily checked .",
    "condition ( iv ) and the network initial state set @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath111    for @xmath112 , one obtains    @xmath113 namely the solution .    the `` wise '' unitary transformation ( 9 ) ( to how to behave on the whole ) brings the state of the network from satisfying only the input to satisfying both the input and the output constraints .",
    "it is obtained by `` blindly '' operating on _ divided parts _ of the network , but under @xmath57 projection .",
    "the latter is the _ conquering _ agent .",
    "it is worth analysing the character of this computation process . we will consider a generic boolean network where each wire comprises ( without loss of generality ) a not  function , and is implemented by a transmission .    first ,",
    "let us assume that the network has exactly one solution .",
    "the network eigenstates @xmath0 tensor products of eigenstates of the network parts @xmath0 inherently satisfy all gates ( by definition , a gate is a part whose eigenstates map the gate logical input - output function ) .",
    "network preparation is described by just one tensor product ( as in the example of fig .",
    "4 ) . beyond the gates , this satisfies input constraints and all transmissions , not the output constraint ( but for a lucky chance ) .",
    "then , we start operating on the density matrices of those input / output qubits which must satisfy the external constraints , _ under _ _ the _ @xmath74 _ projections _",
    "( one for each transmission ) , in order to keep the constrained inputs unaltered , while bringing the output in match with its constraint .",
    "this computation process works on the basis vectors of the network hilbert space , which satisfy all gates , and can not originate a tensor product which violates an @xmath57 symmetry .",
    "in counterfactual reasoning , if there had been such a `` bad '' tensor product , its amplitude would have been canceled by continuous @xmath57 projection and , through renormalization , would have gone to feed the amplitudes of the `` good '' tensor products .",
    "computation becomes thus a _ unitary _ _ evolution _ of the overall network state , _ driven _ by the operations on some parts ( on the input / output qubits which must satisfy the external constraints ) and _ shaped _ by @xmath57 projections .    as a result of this process ,",
    "@xmath57 symmetries become constants of motion which commute with the propagation at all times .",
    "they are also pairwise commuting , being applied to disjoint hilbert spaces .",
    "however , the cause should not be confused with the effect .",
    "@xmath57 projections shape or forge the unitary evolution with which they commute .",
    "this , according to the projection interpretation of particle statistics ( section iii ) .",
    "it is clear from this picture that the two propagations of conditional logical implication , from input to output and vice - versa , never originate a collision ( a tensor product where a transmission is in an inconsistent state ) .",
    "the amplitudes of collisions must be zero because of continuous projection .",
    "computation can never go into a deadlock .",
    "it is of course a _ unitary evolution _ toward the solution , driven , as we have seen , by operating on the parts and shaped by projecting the whole .",
    "if the network admits no solution , conditions ( i ) through ( iv ) make up an impossible system .",
    "measuring the network final state @xmath0 when the operations on the parts are completed @xmath114 @xmath0 gives some random result which is not a solution .",
    "this is checkable in polynomial time and tells that the network is not satisfiable .",
    "if the network admits many solutions , the final state can be a linear combination thereof .",
    "which linear combination , depends on the network initial state through condition ( iv ) .",
    "this can be seen through numerical calculation .",
    "however this is irrelevant since measurement anyhow gives one solution ( that it is a solution is checkable in polynomial time ) .",
    "we should better clarify how parts should be connected by transmissions .",
    "5 illustrates the appropriate arrangement ( the network of fig .",
    "4 was simplified ) .",
    "all elementary gates and the constrained input / output qubits are interconnected through transmissions .",
    "namely any network _ wire _",
    "connecting nodes say @xmath1 and @xmath2 , becomes a _ transmission _ , or projector @xmath57 .",
    "it should be made clear that this is not necessary , but useful .",
    "two or more elementary gates could be interconnected without the interposition of transmissions .",
    "however , this would require `` building '' an exponentially more complex gate and the number of its eigenstates would be the product of the number of eigenstates of the individual gates .",
    "transmissions are exactly meant to reduce network complexity ( exponentially with the number of transmissions ) .",
    "clearly , they introduce a divide and conquer strategy.this quantum form of reductionism would be more rewarding than ( the known ) classical reductionism . at this abstract level",
    ", it would make np - complete @xmath115 p. of course we are applying reverse engineering and we have just highlighted a nice - to - have feature , namely the @xmath57 projection .",
    "this raises the problem whether this feature is physical . until now",
    ", we have seen that these projections share the nature of particle statistics symmetries , under a special interpretation thereof .",
    "we will show that the `` artificial '' symmetry @xmath57 of a quantum mechanical transmission is an epiphenomenon of fermionic antisymmetry in a special physical situation .",
    "this is generated by submitting a couple of identical fermions 1 and 2 to a suitable hamiltonian @xmath116}$ ] .",
    "we assume that each fermion has two compatible , binary degrees of freedom @xmath117 and @xmath118 . just for the sake of visualization",
    ", we can assume that each fermion is a spin @xmath119 particle and can occupy one of either two sites of a spatial lattice . in this case",
    "@xmath117 becomes the particle spin component @xmath120 ( down ) , @xmath121 ( up ) and @xmath122 the label of the site occupied by the particle .",
    "therefore the hilbert space of the spatial states of the two fermions is :    @xmath123 where @xmath124 means that particle 1 is in site @xmath1 , particle 2 is also in site @xmath1 , etc .",
    "the hilbert space of the spin states of the two fermions is :    @xmath125 @xmath126 means that the @xmath127 component of particle 1 is 0 ( down ) , etc .",
    "the overall hilbert space @xmath128 has 16 basis vectors .",
    "the following is the list of the states which do not violate statistics .",
    "states are represented in first and second quantization and , when applicable , in qubit notation :    * both particles in the same site , spin ( necessarily ) in the singlet state :    @xmath129    @xmath130    * one particle per site , antisymmetrical spatial state vector , spin ( necessarily ) in a triplet state :    @xmath131    @xmath132    @xmath133    @xmath134    * one particle per site , symmetrical spatial state vector , spin ( necessarily ) in the singlet state :    @xmath135    @xmath136    creation / annihilation operators form the algebra :    @xmath137    now we introduce the hamiltonian    @xmath138 or , in second quantization ,    @xmath139    with @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 discretely above 0 .",
    "this leaves us with two degenerate ground eigenstates :    @xmath143 alternatively , their linear combinations @xmath144 and @xmath145 can be used as the two orthogonal ground eigenstates .",
    "the generic ground state is thus :    @xmath146    it can be seen that @xmath13 satisfies @xmath57 symmetry .",
    "let @xmath147 and renormalization be the antisymmetrization projector , where @xmath148 permutes particles 1 , 2 .",

    "also , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , without forgetting that these are excited states .",

    "the transmission density matrix should be kept on ground .    however , let us examine the case that the operation in question is not fully adiabatic .",

    "actually , all @xmath74 projectors commute with the propagator of the network state ( shaped by the @xmath57 ) .",
    "the notion of applying a particle statistics symmetry ( seen as a projector ) to divide the quantum whole into parts without clipping its richness , introduces an engineering ( reductionistic ) perspective in the design of quantum mechanisms . for the time being , the development of this idea remains at an abstract level .",
    "finding model hamiltonians which implement the hermitean matrix of section vi could possibly be the next step .",
    "the form of computation propounded seems to imply a somewhat deeper interpretation of the notion of time - reversibility .",
    "indeed the very notion of quantum computation was born as an evolution of the notion of reversible computation@xmath191 } $ ] .",
    "now we further conjecture that any quantum computation speed - up is related to the notion of the coexistence of forward and backward in time computation ( or propagation ) .",
    "this can be shown both in the traditional approach of sequential quantum computation ( where the boolean network appears in the time - diagram of the computation process ) and in the approach propounder here .",
    "let us consider sequential computation first . here",
    "computation speed - up can be related to the notion of performing inverse computation ( of a hard to invert function ) by using direct computation in a time reversed way ( which of course requires computation reversibility ) . in this way ,",
    "the time interval used by inverse computation is the same of direct computation .",
    "for example , with simon s algorithm , given a ( hard to invert ) function @xmath192 , 2-to-1 with periodicity @xmath1 , @xmath1 can always be found in polynomial time .",
    "an essential point of this algorithm is measuring @xmath193 in the entangled state .",
    "then , after applying the hadamard transform , measurement of the left register and some repetitions of the entire process bring @xmath1 out in the episystem .",
    "however , it can be argued that the quantum speed - up is already in the intermediate result ( 12 ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "if this were the printout of a classical computer ( with @xmath197 and @xmath1 substituted by the appropriate numerical assignments ) , computation time would be exponential .",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "measurement of the right register ( right - top of figure 6 ) , _ after _ computation , gives no information since the result is random .",
    "this result , @xmath198 , goes backward in time along the right branch @xmath1 to the interaction region ( the cloud ) , where the _ direct function _ is computed . since the result of measurement now goes back in time , the _ inverse function _ is computed ( which would require exponential time in classical computation ) .",
    "naturally , the time interval required is that for computing the direct function .",
    "this effectively implies the coexistence of forward and backward in time computation .",
    "the result of inverse computation is state ( 12 ) in the left register , which goes forward in time along the left branch . further processing brings the symbol @xmath1 out in the episystem .",
    "this algorithm clearly computes the inverse function through a time inversion of direct computation .    by the way ,",
    "this is no time - travel , no information can go to the past .",
    "the result of measurement is random and provides no information .",
    "thus , there is no information in the final state of computation .",
    "furthermore , reversible computation@xmath199 } $ ] neither destroys nor creates information . to sum up , there is no information whatsoever that can go back in time .",
    "this is much similar to epr  correlations .",
    "epr entanglement can be seen as an elementary computation .",
    "one can still use fig . 6 with @xmath200 ( normalization is disregarded ) .",
    "measurement on , say , the right particle originates a random result , this is first propagated backward in time to the region of the interaction , then forward in time to the left particle , which carries that result to the left measurement .",
    "this epr interpretation has been formalized by using a two - way propagation model in [ 22 ] .",
    "this interpretation of the quantum computation speed - up can be extended to all quantum algorithms found so far@xmath201 } $ ] @xmath0 readily by using the unified model developed by a. ekert@xmath202 } $ ] .    two - way computation / propagation is also an interpretation of the computation model propounded in this work .",
    "the _ state _ of the transmission @xmath189 at some time @xmath27 must change due to the operations performed on a _ part of it_. the new overall state is forged by @xmath57 projection .",
    "this projection gives two possible outcomes : one in @xmath17 ( satisfying @xmath57 ) , the other in the orthogonal subspace @xmath203 ( violating @xmath57 ) .",
    "because of continuous projection , the probability of violating @xmath57 is rounded off to sharp zero .",
    "this rounding off is implied in the mathematically simultaneous application of ( i ) operation on a part and ( ii ) projection of the whole on a _ predetermined _ _ outcome _ ( conditions ( i ) through ( iv ) of section vi ) . in other words ,",
    "the choice between ending up in @xmath17 or @xmath203 is predetermined by the requirement that the _ projection _ outcome will satisfy a certain final condition ( @xmath57 symmetry ) .",
    "projection on a predetermined outcome ( @xmath17 ) would be `` magic '' if the state to be projected had cumulated a discrete distance from @xmath17 . a condition set in the future would determine a choice in the past .",
    "it is less `` magic '' because projection is continuous .",
    "still , computation speed - up is essentially related to it .",
    "so to speak , this is equivalent to always guessing the right choice in a decision process @xmath0 in pruning a decision tree .",
    "this overcomes the `` blindness '' of the operations on the parts and makes the evolution wise to how to reach ( unitarily ) the problem solution .",
    "this also implies a propagation which is elusively ( without time - travel ) driven by _ both _ the initial and the final conditions@xmath204 } $ ] .",
