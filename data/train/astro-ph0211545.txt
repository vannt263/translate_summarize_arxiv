    "physicists have long speculated that the fundamental constants might not , in fact , be constant , but might instead vary with time @xcite . among the various possibilities",
    "the interaction coupling constants have received the greatest attention ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a great deal of attention has been focused on the fine structure constant @xmath3 , for which a time variation has been claimed in observations of quasar absorption lines @xcite .",
    "cosmological limits on a time variation in @xmath3 can be derived from both big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "comparatively less interest has been inspired by possible time variation in the strength of the weak interaction , as parametrized by the fermi coupling @xmath4 .",
    "however , as emphasized by dixit and sher @xcite , the fermi constant is not a fundamental constant in the same sense as the fine structure constant .",
    "the fermi constant is given by @xmath5 therefore , it is more appropriate to examine the variation of the higgs vacuum expectation value than that of the fermi constant .",
    "in fact , the time variation of the vacuum expectation value of a field seems somewhat more plausible than the time variation of a fundamental coupling constant .",
    "( for arguments in favor of a possible _ spatial _ variation of the higgs vacuum expectation value , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "limits on the time variation of the higgs vacuum expectation value have been derived from bbn @xcite . however , improved observational limits on the primordial element abundances now allow us to place stronger limits than those derived , for example in ref .",
    "furthermore , these previous studies ignored the effect of the change in the deuteron binding energy , which we have incorporated into our calculations .",
    "the effects of a variation in @xmath0  on the cmb have been investigated previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this paper made no attempt to derive actual limits based on observational cmb data , which we will do here .    in this paper , we derive constraints on the time variation of @xmath0  from both bbn and cmb observations . in this regard ,",
    "the present work is most similar in spirit to that of avelino et al .",
    "@xcite , who did a comparable calculation for @xmath3 . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect on the cmb of changing the higgs vacuum expectation value is similar , but not quite identical , to the effect of changing @xmath3 .",
    "the effects on bbn , on the other hand , are quite different .",
    "we assume that @xmath0  has the same value at the era of primordial nucleosynthesis @xmath6 k as it has at recombination @xmath7 k , but our results can easily be generalized to cases where this is not so .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss the effects of @xmath0  variation on bbn . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the effect on recombination and calculate the cmb temperature anisotropy . finally , we discuss our results and conclusions in sec .",
    "we take @xmath8 throughout .",
    "a time variation in @xmath0  affects big bang nucleosynthesis in several ways .",
    "the variation of @xmath0  changes @xmath4 , as given in equation ( [ g_f ] ) , which alters the weak @xmath9 interaction rates .",
    "changing @xmath0  also alters the fermion masses as @xmath10 consequently , the electron and the quark masses change .",
    "the change in the electron mass alters the @xmath9 rates ( see below ) and affects the evolution of the electron - positron energy density during the epoch of nucleosynthesis . due to the changes in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark masses , the neutron - proton mass difference changes , and the pion mass varies .",
    "the latter affects nucleosynthesis through the change in the binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "we have incorporated all of these effects into our calculations .",
    "consider first the neutron - proton mass difference , @xmath13 .",
    "following ichikawa and kawasaki @xcite , we take @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the present higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "this change in @xmath16 alters the ratio of neutron to proton abundances in thermal equilibrium : @xmath17 the effect on the @xmath1he abundance due to the change in @xmath16 ( alone ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "an increase in @xmath0  leads to an increase in @xmath16 , giving a smaller equilibrium neutron - proton ratio , which produces a smaller @xmath1he abundance .",
    "the weak interactions which interconvert neutrons and protons are affected by both the change in @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",

    "a similar expression can be derived for the @xmath24 rate .",
    "( note that in the actual bbn calculation , the weak rates are scaled off of the neutron lifetime ; we have simply rescaled these rates using equation [ n->p ] ) .",
    "note that these rates depend on both @xmath4 and @xmath18 , both of which are altered by changing @xmath0  .",
    "there is a further small change in bbn produced by the effect on the expansion rate of the total @xmath25 energy density , which depends on @xmath18 .",
    "we have included this effect , although it is small . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the effect on the @xmath1he abundance of changing @xmath18 and @xmath4 separately .",
    "note that most of the change from @xmath18 is due to the change in the weak rates , as we have noted , rather than from the change in the expansion rate .",
    "an increase in @xmath0  results in a decrease in @xmath4 , leading to earlier freeze - out of the @xmath9 reactions , producing more @xmath1he .",
    "similarly , an increase in @xmath0  results in an increase in @xmath18 , decreasing the @xmath9 reaction rates and also producing more @xmath1he .",
    "= 3.5truein    finally , changing @xmath0  alters the deuteron binding energy through the change in the pion mass @xcite , @xmath26 early calculations suggested a linear dependence of @xmath27 ( the deuteron binding energy ) on @xmath28 , and in previous discussions of bbn with a time - varying @xmath0  , it was argued that this effect would be negligible and could be ignored @xcite ( although the effect of changing @xmath27 was explored in a slightly different context in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although more recent calculations @xcite have not produced a definitive result for the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath28 , they are in qualitative agreement over our limited range of interest ( i.e. , very small changes in @xmath28 . ) in this regime , @xmath27 is a _ decreasing _ function @xmath28 ( the opposite of what was previously assumed @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations in both @xcite and @xcite have very large uncertainties , but within our narrow range of interest , we can safely approximate the change in @xmath27 as a linear dependence on @xmath28 , through @xmath29 where the 0 subscript denotes the values of these quantities at present , and the coefficient @xmath30 in the fitting formula is to be derived from refs .",
    "we estimate the central values for @xmath30 from these references to be @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "although these values for @xmath30 are quite different , we will see that they lead to similar constraints on a change in @xmath0  . on the other hand ,",
    "our constraint differs sharply from what is derived by ignoring the change in @xmath27 .    the effect on the helium abundance of changing @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( for @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is clear that this effect is not negligible .",
    "further , ( and unlike the other effects we have considered ) changing @xmath27 has a significant effect on the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "this is most evident from our graphs of the allowed region for @xmath0  ( see figs .",
    "@xmath34 below ) .",
    "an increase in @xmath0  leads to an increase in @xmath28 , resulting in a decrease in @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to a smaller equilibrium deuterium abundance .",
    "thus , the production of @xmath1he begins later , leading to a smaller @xmath1he abundance , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . somewhat paradoxically , a decrease in the deuterium binding energy leads to an _ increase _ in the final deuterium abundance ; nucleosynthesis at lower temperatures faces a larger coulomb barrier , leaving more deuterium behind .    to derive bbn limits on a change in @xmath0  ,",
    "we assume two free parameters , the baryon to photon ratio @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we vary these parameters within the range @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "to derive our constraints , we consider only the abundances of deuterium and @xmath1he .",
    "recent observations @xcite suggest the limits @xmath39 on the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen , and @xmath40 on the primordial mass fraction of @xmath1he .",
    "we ignore the somewhat more uncertain limits on @xmath41li in determining our constraints , although we have verified that the allowed regions we derive from bbn also produce an acceptable @xmath41li abundance .    our limits on shown in figs .",
    "@xmath42 , where we have translated our constraints on @xmath35 into limits on @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show ( for reference ) the effect of neglecting the deuteron binding energy , while figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] correspond to our two choices for @xmath30 .",
    "the solid lines give the constraints from the deuterium and @xmath1he abundances , with the shaded area indicating the region producing an acceptable abundance of both .",
    "= 3.5truein    = 3.5truein    = 3.5truein    the importance of including the effect of the deuteron binding energy is obvious from comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] to figs .",
    "@xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the regions of allowed deuterium and allowed @xmath1he are almost parallel to the axes , indicating that the deuterium abundance is nearly independent of changes in @xmath0  ; in this approximation , the abundance of deuterium sets the bounds on @xmath43 , with the @xmath1he abundance then determining the limits on @xmath0  . in figs .",
    "@xmath44 , we see a strong dependence of the deuterium abundance on @xmath0  ( through the deuteron binding energy ) , while the allowed band for @xmath1he is much narrower .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are reasonably similar , allowing us to put useful constraints on the time variation in @xmath0  despite the uncertainty in the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath0 .    including the change in the deuteron binding energy , we find that the bbn constraint on @xmath0  variation is extremely tight .",
    "defining @xmath45 , we get @xmath46 for @xmath33 , and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "since the weak interaction has no effect on the recombination process , the only effect of changing @xmath0  arises through the change in the electron mass , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "( we have neglected any change in the mass of the dark matter particle . for axions",

    "the change in @xmath18 alters both the thomson scattering cross section and the binding energy of hydrogen .",
    "the thomson scattering cross - section is @xmath49 while the binding energy of hydrogen is given by @xmath50    the ionization fraction , @xmath51 , is determined by the balance between photoionization and recombination .",
    "the evolution of @xmath51 with a variation in @xmath0  is given by @xcite @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 represent the recombination coefficient , the ionization coefficient , the binding energy of the @xmath57 hydrogen atomic level , and the peebles correction factor , respectively .",
    "the primed quantities stand for the modified coefficients following @xmath0  variation @xcite .",
    "finally , the differential optical depth of the cmb photons is determined by @xmath58    with these modifications , we use cmbfast @xcite to generate the theoretical power spectra of temperature fluctuations .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the effects of @xmath0  variation on the cmb power spectrum .",
    "an increase in @xmath0  leads to a decrease in the thomson scattering cross section and an increase in the hydrogen binding energy .",
    "the latter effect is the most important , since it shifts the last - scattering surface to a smaller comoving length scale , moving the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] to the right .",
    "= 3.5truein    using radpack @xcite , we perform a @xmath59 analysis for the most recent cmb data : vsa , boomerang , dasi , maxima and cbi @xcite . assuming a flat universe ( @xmath60 )",
    ", we set the model parameter space @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 ) , and we take the spectral index @xmath64 to lie in the range @xmath65 .",
    "the power spectra are obtained by a modified cmbfast with @xmath0  variation .",
    "we then marginalize over @xmath0  and @xmath66 .",
    "the cmb constraints are shown in figs .",
    "@xmath67 ( identical in all three figures ) .",
    "the dotted and the dashed lines represent the 95% and the 68% confidence level regions of the cmb experiments , respectively . in general ,",
    "the cmb calculations provide less stringent constraints than bbn ; almost the entire region allowed by bbn lies inside the 95% confidence region from the cmb .",
    "the small area allowed by bbn and excluded by the cmb represents a tighter bound on @xmath43 , but it does not alter the limits on @xmath0  .",
    "this work provides new constraints on the possible time - variation of @xmath0  from both bbn and the cmb .",
    "we find that the bbn limits are significantly more stringent than those that can be derived from the cmb .",
    "more specifically , we get @xmath68 with the exact numbers depending on the assumptions made about the dependence of the deuteron binding energy on @xmath28 . these limits are considerably more stringent than those in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , due to better observational limits on the primordial element abundances , as well as the inclusion of the ( previously - neglected ) effect of @xmath0  on the deuteron binding energy .",
    "in contrast , the limits from the cmb are much less stringent .",
    "this conclusion is similar to the results obtained for the time - variation in @xmath3 obtained by avelino et al .",
    "( note also that the effect of a time - variation in @xmath3 and a time variation in @xmath0  are almost completely degenerate @xcite , but bbn breaks this degeneracy ) .",
    "the chief advantages of considering the cmb limits are that the calculation is much more straightforward ( dependent only on the change in the electron mass ) , and that the cmb limits should improve sharply in the near future as more observational data comes in . of course , if @xmath0  varied between the epoch of bbn ( @xmath6 k ) and the epoch of recombination ( @xmath69 k ) , then the limits we have derived could be applied separately to constrain @xmath70 at each epoch .",
