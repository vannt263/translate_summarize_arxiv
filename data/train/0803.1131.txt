    "extensive experimental and theoretical investigation have been devoted to the study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics and @xmath3 phenomenon in double quantum dot molecules @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a wide literature on transport through double quantum dots ( @xmath4 ) in different geometries , e.g , @xmath4 in series and in parallel @xcite .",
    "two aspects of electronic transport through quantum dots have attracted great attention in the last years , the coulomb blockade effect and the kondo effect . recently",
    "kondo effect has been studied in side attached @xcite and parallel quantum dots @xcite .",
    "recent electron transport experiments showed that kondo and fano resonances occur simultaneously @xcite .",
    "multiple scattering of traveling electronic waves on a localized magnetic state are crucial for the formation of both resonances .",
    "the condition for the fano resonance is the existence of two scattering channels : a discrete level and a broad continuum band @xcite .",
    "an alternative configuration consists of a double quantum dot molecule side coupled to a perfect quantum wire ( qw)@xcite . this structure is reminiscent of the t - shaped quantum wave guides @xcite . in this case , the qds act as scattering centers in close analogy with the traditional kondo effect @xcite .",
    "although the electron - electron interaction does play an important role in many systems that exhibit negative differential conductance , as for instance producing bi - stabilities in the current , it is not the driving force of the negative conductance itself . in this work instead , we study a system in the kondo regime with a @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics that possesses a @xmath3 region that is induced by the electronic correlation itself , tuned by the external potential and the parameters of the system .",
    "the system is constituted by a quantum dot molecule side coupled to a quantum wire , as shown in fig .",

    "we use the finite-@xmath2 slave boson mean - field approach , which was initially developed by kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite and used later by bing dong and x. l. lei to study the transport through coupled double quantum dots connected to leads dl01 .",
    "this approach enforces the correspondence between the impurity fermions and the auxiliary bosons to a mean - field level to release the @xmath5 restriction .",
    "this allows to treat non - perturbatively the dot - lead coupling for an arbitrary strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath2 @xcite .    in a previous work",
    "we study this system in a thermodynamic equilibrium situation .",
    "we found that in the weak interaction regime , when the direct antiferromagnetic interaction between the dots is less than the kondo temperature associated to the internal dot , the transmission spectrum shows a structure with two anti - resonances localized at the renormalized molecular energies of the double quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the ldos of the system shows that when the kondo correlations are dominant the system is in a two stage kondo regime with two different temperatures @xmath6 , each one associated to a dot .    in the present paper",
    "we study this system under the effect of a finite external field , which takes it out of the thermodynamic equilibrium , modifying the kondo regime and even destroying it , for enough large fields .",
    "this process has fundamental consequences on the transport properties of the system , and in particular , creates a remarkable @xmath3 in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics .",
    "this @xmath3 phenomenon can be understood realizing that the applied bias destroys the lower temperature kondo state of the external dot modifying the capability of the other to interfere on the current that goes along the system .",

    "when an external potential is applied the scenario changes completely .",
    "the physics of this new situation can be explained analyzing the current and the differential conductance @xmath115 , two significant and experimentally measurable quantities , as a function of the applied field .",

    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics shows a plateau that is related to the fano antiresonances in the transmission spectrum .",
    "when the applied potential is of the order of the interdot interaction , the transmission , due to the fano destructive interference , is almost zero in the bonding and antibonding regions giving no additional contribution to the total current as the applied potential is increased .",
    "this is the origin of the plateau behavior , shown in the figure [ f : fig4 ] , when u=0 .",

    "the third term arises from the kondo state weakly coupled to the wire and it is responsible for the rapid increase of the current in the region of small applied potentials .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in this expression the quantities @xmath132 and @xmath133 are functions of @xmath1 obtained through the self - consistent calculation presented above .",
    "the case of @xmath134 is shown in the inset of fig.[f : fig6 ] .",
    "it is clear that increasing @xmath1 , both the kondo temperature of the external dot and the current reduce to zero simultaneously with the disappearance of the @xmath3 phenomenon . as mentioned above ,",
    "this behavior can be understood realizing that the effect of the external quantum dot is to reduce the intermediate dot interference effect on the current circulating along the leads .",
    "this role is exercised by the external quantum dot as far as it is at the kondo regime .",

    "this seems to be the behavior of a two stage kondo system under the effect of an external potential .",
    "the kondo regime of the outside quantum dot , not directly connected to the continuum , depends upon the kondo effect of the intermediate quantum dot . as",

    "for @xmath146 and @xmath147 the maximum and minimum of the current are @xmath148 na and @xmath149 na , respectively , giving a peak to valley ratio of 4:1 .",
