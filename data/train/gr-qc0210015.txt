    ", however , the rays bend due to the attraction of gravity as they follow geodesics of the spacetime manifold that are null .",
    "it turns out that in order to evaluate the gravitational time delay to first order in @xmath6 only the null condition is required , i.e. @xmath7 we are interested in the consequences of this condition for the propagation of a ray on a background global _ inertial frame_. therefore , it follows from equation ( 1 ) that @xmath8 .",
    "to first order in the perturbation , the bending of the ray may be neglected in evaluating the right - hand side of this result , which may be written as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is such that @xmath11 .",
    "one may therefore write equation ( 1 ) in the form @xmath12 let the ray propagate from a point @xmath13 to a point @xmath14 in the background inertial frame ; then , @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the euclidean length element along the straight line that joins @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",

    "moreover , under a gauge transformation of the gravitational potential @xmath25 , corresponding to an infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath26 , equation ( 4 ) simply gives the time delay in the new coordinates .",
    "in physical circumstances where the linearized einstein equations are applicable , the time delay @xmath27 may be combined with the proper time @xmath28 measured by an observer moving with velocity @xmath29 , @xmath30 in order to arrive at physically measurable predictions of the theory .",
    "the gravitational time delay was studied by shapiro @xcite in terms of radar echo delay and subsequently by a number of investigators ( see @xcite@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "the general derivation of the linear effect ( 4 ) given here is free of special assumptions and can be employed in most situations of physical interest .",
    "the gravitomagnetic time delay is discussed in sections 2 and 3 .",

    "in section 5 we analyze the gravitomagnetic time delay in different images of the same source due to gravitational lensing .",
    "finally , section 6 contains a brief discussion of our results .",
    "let us now consider the exterior field of slowly moving sources such that the trace - reversed potential @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 , once the gauge condition @xmath33 has been imposed .",
    "we are interested in the particular retarded solution @xmath34 which can be used directly in equation ( 4 ) to compute the gravitational time delay .",
    "the generalization of the shapiro effect to time - dependent situations has been the subject of a recent investigation @xcite .",
    "we confine our study here to the _ stationary _ field of a slowly rotating astronomical body such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gravitoelectric potential , @xmath38 is the gravitomagnetic vector potential @xmath39 and we neglect all terms of order @xmath40 including the spatial potentials @xmath41 .",
    "far from the source @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the total mass and angular momentum of the source .",
    "we define the gravitoelectric field to be @xmath45 and the gravitomagnetic field to be @xmath46 . in developing this analogy with electrodynamics ,",
    "one encounters extra numerical factors that can not be avoided .",
    "for instance , the field equation for the standard gravitomagnetic vector potential has an extra factor of @xmath47 in comparison with maxwell s theory [ 2 ] . in this connection , we use the following convention that is consistent with the gravitational larmor theorem @xcite : the standard formulas of classical electrodynamics are applicable , except that for a source of inertial mass @xmath43 , the gravitoelectric charge is @xmath43 and the gravitomagnetic charge is @xmath48 ( in units such that @xmath49 ) . on the other hand , for a test particle of mass @xmath50 , the gravitoelectric charge is @xmath51 and the gravitomagnetic charge is @xmath52 .",
    "the source and the test particle have opposite charges to ensure that gravity is attractive . moreover , the ratio of the gravitomagnetic charge to the gravitoelectric charge is always 2 , since linearized gravity is a spin-2 field .",
    "we find from equation ( 4 ) that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the _ shapiro time delay _ and @xmath55 is the _ gravitomagnetic time delay _ , which is simply proportional to the line integral of the gravitomagnetic vector potential .",
    "let us now suppose that we can arrange via `` mirrors ''  these could be transponders on spacecraft  to have the rays travel on a closed trajectory as in figure 1 .",
    "then the net gravitomagnetic time delay for a closed loop in the positive sense ( i.e. counterclockwise ) is @xmath56 which is simply proportional to the gravitomagnetic flux threaded by a surface @xmath57 whose boundary is the closed loop under consideration .",
    "imagine now a point @xmath58 on the trajectory ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) . if the rays travel along the same path but in the opposite direction , the net gravitoelectric time delay measured at @xmath58 will be the same while the gravitomagnetic time delay will change sign , @xmath59 .",
    "thus the total time difference at @xmath58 for the rays to go around the loop in opposite directions is given by @xmath60 a different derivation of this result based on the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in the gravitational field of a rotating mass is contained in ref .",
    "@xcite . contains an errant minus sign .",
    "therefore in equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) and related discussion in section 3 of @xcite , the sign of @xmath61 has to be reversed . ]",
    "let us now estimate this time difference for the case of gps signals traveling around the earth .",
    "we find that @xmath62 sec .",
    "by contrast , the shapiro time delay amounts to @xmath63 sec for clocks in gps orbit @xcite , @xcite , so that this gravitoelectric effect may be measurable in the near future .",
    "in such an experiment , the time of flight of the signal is monitored and eventually measured by a control station on the earth @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the corresponding gravitomagnetic effect is about two million times smaller and can be completely neglected at present .",
    "other very small angular momentum effects in laboratory - based optical interferometry experiments have been studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section , we provide explicit formulas for @xmath64 for the case of radiation crossing a slowly rotating thin shell of matter as well as propagating in the exterior field of a distant rotating mass .    in electrodynamics ,",
    "the magnetic vector potential inside a spherical shell of uniform charge density with total charge @xmath65 and radius @xmath66 rotating with constant frequency @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the uniform magnetic field inside the shell .",
    "the corresponding electric field vanishes .",
    "therefore , the gravitomagnetic vector potential inside a uniform shell of mass @xmath43 , radius @xmath66 and rotational frequency @xmath70 is @xcite , @xcite @xmath71 where the center of the shell is the spatial origin of a background inertial frame . thus inside the shell @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the gravitomagnetic time delay is therefore @xmath74 let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the two points on the spherical shell indicating the points at which the ray enters and leaves the sphere , respectively . then a simple calculation shows that @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are unit vectors indicating the positions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , from the center of the sphere .",
    "note that the result vanishes if @xmath70 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are in the same plane ; in particular , @xmath80 if the ray passes through the center of the spherical shell .",
    "let us next consider the exterior field of a rotating mass with its center of mass at the origin of spatial coordinates such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are both much larger than @xmath83 ; then , neglecting higher - order multipole moments we find that @xmath84 a detailed , but straightforward , calculation shows that @xmath85 thus @xmath64 also vanishes in this case if @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in the same plane .",
    "let us note that equation ( [ 16 ] ) is exact and holds in general for the exterior of any spherically symmetric slowly rotating mass with constant @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath89 be the impact parameter of the light ray ; then , when @xmath90 and @xmath91 it is possible to show that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a unit vector normal to the plane formed by @xmath78 and @xmath87 and directed along @xmath94 . extending this calculation to the case",
    "in which the source is a thin rotating spherical shell of constant radius @xmath66 and the light ray penetrates the shell such that the portion of the ray inside the shell subtends an angle @xmath95 at the center of the shell , we find from equations ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) that for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 varies from @xmath100 to @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "the impact parameter of the ray is given by @xmath103 , so that for @xmath104 we recover the previous expression for @xmath64 .",
    "in two recent papers @xcite , @xcite , the gravitomagnetic time delay in different images due to gravitational lensing has been studied and a derivation of the time delay due to the spin of an external shell has been presented .",
    "these results , together with a discussion of the separability of time delays of different origin in the images , demonstrate that the gravitomagnetic time delay would in principle be measurable in the near future .",
    "in particular , the gravitomagnetic time delay must be taken into account in the analysis of gravitational lensing time delay of some extragalactic sources , since the estimated @xmath64 may exceed the present measurement uncertainty of @xmath105 day in the lensing time delay ; we discuss this issue in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "further measurement aspects of @xmath64 are explored in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that the measurement of @xmath64 might provide information about the existence and distribution of rotating dark matter .    it would be interesting to estimate how much of the gravitational time delay between any two local points @xmath17 and @xmath18 could be due to the cosmological content of the universe . to this end",
    ", we consider the development of a fermi coordinate system in the neighborhood of a fundamental geodesic observer in the standard flrw model @xcite . at an epoch with hubble `` constant '' @xmath106 ,",
    "the gravitational time delay over any local distance @xmath107 compared to @xmath108 is of the order @xmath109 , which is negligibly small .",
    "a similar estimate holds for a rotating universe model as explained in the next section .",
    "the metric of the stationary and spatially homogeneous gdel universe can be expressed as @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 and we use units such that @xmath112 unless specified otherwise .",
    "it turns out that for this metric the ricci curvature is given by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the velocity vector of a particle at rest in space and coincides with the timelike killing vector @xmath115 .",
    "the physical content of this model may be thought of as a perfect fluid with velocity @xmath116 and constant density and pressure given by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the vorticity vector associated with the geodesic worldlines of the fluid .",
    "alternatively , the universe could be filled with dust of constant density @xmath119 together with a cosmological constant @xmath120 @xcite .    to study the influence of this rotating cosmos on the local physics",
    ", we establish a fermi normal coordinate system in the neighborhood of a standard observer in this model .",
    "imagine therefore an observer at rest in space and comoving with the fluid ; then , the observer follows a geodesic and its velocity vector @xmath121 is the temporal axis of an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath122 that is parallel transported along the geodesic . in @xmath123",
    "coordinates , such a tetrad is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are defined by @xmath127 here the rotation of the orthonormal triad @xmath128 , representing ideal gyroscope directions characterizing the spatial fermi frame , about the @xmath129-axis with frequency @xmath130 has been made explicit .",
    "the fermi coordinate system assigns coordinates @xmath131 to an event @xmath58 in the neighborhood of the geodesic worldline under consideration as follows : there exists a unique spacelike geodesic connecting @xmath58 to the worldline at @xmath132 such that the two paths are orthogonal at @xmath132 , i.e. @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the unit tangent vector to the spacelike geodesic at @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the proper time of the observer at @xmath135 be the proper length of the spacelike geodesic segment @xmath136 and @xmath137 be the direction cosines of this segment with respect to the observer s triad at @xmath132",
    ". then @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in these",
    "fermi coordinates , the spacetime in the neighborhood of the observer is minkowskian except for the cosmic tidal influence expressed by the gravitational potential @xmath140 , i.e. @xmath141 , where @xmath142 here the riemann curvature components are the projections of the riemann tensor on the tetrad of the observer @xmath143    it turns out that all of the nonzero components of the riemann tensor in @xmath144 coordinates can be obtained from @xmath145 using the symmetries of the riemann tensor .",
    "it follows that in the fermi coordinates all of the nonzero components are given by @xmath146 via the symmetries of the riemann tensor .",
    "thus @xmath147 are the only nonzero components of the gravitational potential and the metric at this linear order is given by @xmath148dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2   \\\\\\nonumber\\\\&- & \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2(xdy - ydx)^2\\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is now straightforward to compute the gravitational time delay ( 4 ) using the relations ( 31 ) - ( 32 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath149 ^ 2}{|{\\bf   r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2| } + |{\\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2| [ ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\omega$}\\times{\\bf   r}_1)^2 \\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\   & + & ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\omega$}\\times{\\bf r}_2)^2 + ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\omega$ } \\times { \\bf r}_1)\\cdot   ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\omega$}\\times { \\bf r}_2)]\\biggr\\}\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath150 and @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the position vectors of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .    the relative time delay for a signal from the observer @xmath153 to a local distance @xmath154 compared to @xmath155 is thus given by @xmath156 , which is negligibly small on the basis of the current upper limit of @xmath157 sec@xmath158 on the possible rate of rotation of the universe @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "in gravitational lensing , depending upon the relative position and distance of the source , observer and deflecting mass , several images of the same source may be observed .",
    "numerous examples of gravitational lensing have been discovered ; a well - known case is the gravitational lens q2237 + 0305 , or einstein cross , where the path of light from a quasar estimated to be at a distance of approximately 8 billion light years is bent by the gravitational field of a galaxy estimated to be at a distance of about 400 million light years .",
    "this light bending produces four images of the same quasar as observed from the earth @xcite , @xcite .    the gravitomagnetic time delay due to the spin of an astrophysical object",
    "might then be detected in different images of the same source by gravitational lensing .",
    "time delay in the images may be generated by the spins of the deflecting object and of other bodies around the path of the light rays , e.g. by the spin of an external rotating mass .",
    "let us estimate the spin time delay corresponding to some astrophysical configurations . for simplicity , to derive the order of magnitude of the gravitomagnetic time delay we assume that the source , lens and observer are aligned .",
    "nevertheless , there is an additional time delay , called geometrical time delay @xcite , due to the different geometrical paths followed by different rays .",
    "depending on the geometry of the system , this additional term may be very large and may be the main source of time delay .",
    "however , if we compare the time delay of photons that follow the same geometrical path we can neglect the geometrical time delay , as in the case of two light rays with the same impact parameter but on different sides of the deflecting object . for a small deflection angle ,",
    "the contribution to the travel time delay from the deflected path length traveled is of the second order in the deflecting potentials ; however , depending on the geometrical configuration considered , this delay may need to be included in the total time delay . here , for simplicity , we neglect any geometrical time delay . furthermore , there is a relative time delay due to the quadrupole moment of the central mass distribution . it is shown in @xcite how , in the special case of multiple images of the source with the same impact parameter , propagating along the same axis , one may in principle have enough observables to solve for the angular momentum @xmath44 and mass @xmath43 of the central deflecting body by eliminating the time delay due to the unknown quadrupole moment .",
    "of course , for other configurations in which the source is not exactly aligned with the lens and the observer , the difference in the paths traveled and the corresponding difference in the shapiro time delay can be the main source of relative time delay ; one would then need to model and remove these delays between the different images on the basis of the observed geometry of the system .",
    "let us now calculate the time delay due to the spin of some astrophysical sources .",
    "for the sun , @xmath159 km and @xmath160 km , by considering two light rays traveling on the equatorial plane with impact parameters @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the relative gravitomagnetic time delay from formula ( 16 ) is given by @xmath163 sec .",
    "the time delay due to spin of the sun could then , in principle , be measured using an interferometer at a distance of about @xmath164 km by detecting the gravitationally deflected photons emitted by a laser on the side of the sun opposite the detector and traveling on opposite sides of the sun to the interferometer . to derive the time delay due to the lensing galaxy of the einstein cross @xcite , @xcite , we assume a simple model for the rotation and shape of the central object",
    ". details about this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the angular separation between the four images is about @xmath165 , corresponding to a radius of closest approach of about @xmath166 pc , and the mass inside a shell with this radius is @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "let us assume that @xmath168 km@xmath169 , we then have from formula ( 16 ) that @xmath170 min .",
    "thus , at least in principle , one could measure the time delay due to the spin of the lensing galaxy ; of course , as in the case of the sun , one should be able to model with sufficient accuracy and remove all the other delays due to other physical effects from the observed time delays between the images . as a third example we consider the relative time delay of photons due to the spin of a typical cluster of galaxies of mass @xmath171 , radius @xmath172 mpc and angular velocity @xmath173 sec@xmath158 ; depending on the geometry of the system and on the path followed by the photons , we then find relative time delays ranging from a few minutes to several days @xcite .    especially interesting is the case of gravitomagnetic time delay due to the rotation of an external sphere .",
    "let us now calculate the time delay in the travel time of photons propagating inside a rotating shell corresponding to some astrophysical configurations . in the case of the einstein cross @xcite , in order to get an order of magnitude of the effect , we assume that the lensing galaxy has a radius @xmath174 kpc ; after some calculations based on the model given in @xcite and integrating formula ( 14 ) , the relative time delay of two photons traveling at distances of @xmath175 pc on opposite sides from the center is given by @xmath176 min . if the lensing galaxy is inside a rotating cluster , or super - cluster of galaxies , to get an order of magnitude of the time delay due to the spin of the mass rotating around the deflecting galaxy , we use typical super - cluster parameters : total mass @xmath177 , radius @xmath178 mpc and angular velocity @xmath179 sec@xmath158 @xcite .",
    "if the galaxy is in the center of the cluster and light rays have impact parameters @xmath180 kpc ( of the order of the milky way radius ) , the time delay , in the case of constant density @xmath181 can be determined by integrating formula ( 14 ) and the result is @xmath182 day .    finally , if the lensing galaxy is not at the center of the cluster of radius @xmath154 but at a distance @xmath183 from the center , with @xmath184 , by integrating formula ( 14 ) between the impact parameter @xmath185 and @xmath154 , we find that when the impact parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 of two light rays are approximately equal @xmath186 thus , if the lensing galaxy is at a distance of 10 mpc from the center of the cluster , the relative time delay due to the spin of the external rotating mass between two photons with @xmath187 kpc is @xmath188 day .",
    "promising candidates to observe the time delay due to spin are systems of the type of the gravitational lens b0218 + 357 @xcite , where the separation angle between the images is so small , 335 milliarcsec for b0218 + 357 , that the time delay between the images is also very small , about 10.5 days for the two images of this system .",
    "in such cases , the total time delay is comparable , for a favorable configuration , to the time delay due to spin .",
    "in addition , an einstein ring is observed in the system b0218 + 357 and the diameter of the ring is the same as the separation of the images .",
    "in such a configuration , the einstein ring can provide strong constraints on the mass distribution in the lens ; in turn , this can be extremely useful in order to distinguish time delays of different origin .",
    "since the present measurement uncertainty in the lensing time delay is of the order of 0.5 day , the gravitomagnetic time delay might already be observable @xcite .",
    "for example in the system b0218 + 357 the measured delay is 10.5@xmath1890.4 day .",
    "this measurement is possible because the source is a strongly variable radio object , thus one can determine the time delay of the variations in the images . in the case of b0218 + 357 it is possible to observe distinct variations in the total flux density , percentage polarization and the polarization position angle at two frequencies .",
    "time delay plays an important role in classical wave scattering as well as quantum scattering theory ( see @xcite for a recent comprehensive survey of this subject ) . here",
    "we have confined our attention to the propagation of radiation in the jwkb limit , i.e. null rays , in a gravitational field that is considered only to linear order .",
    "we have then derived expressions for the gravitomagnetic time delay of null rays propagating inside a spinning shell and in the field of rotating masses .",
    "the gravitomagnetic time delay should be taken into account in the modeling of relative time delays of the images of a source observed at a far point by gravitational lensing .",
    "this effect is due to the propagation of the photons in opposite directions with respect to the sense of the spin of the body , or external rotating shell .",
    "if other time delays can be modeled with sufficient accuracy and removed from the observational data , the larger relative delay due to the quadrupole moment of the lensing body can be removed , at least in principle and for some configurations of the images , by using special combinations of the observables ; thus , one could directly measure the spin time delay due to the gravitomagnetic field of the lensing body . in order to estimate the relevance of the spin time delay in some real astrophysical configurations , we have considered some possible astrophysical cases .",
    "we have studied the relative time delay in the gravitational lensing images caused by a typical rotating galaxy or a cluster of galaxies .",
    "we have also analyzed the relative gravitomagnetic time delay when the path of photons is inside a galaxy , a cluster or a super - cluster of galaxies rotating around the deflecting body ; this effect should be large enough to be detectable from the earth .",
    "the measurement of the gravitomagnetic time delay due to the angular momentum of an external massive rotating sphere might be a further observable for the determination of the total mass - energy of the external body , i.e. of the dark matter content of galaxies , clusters and super - clusters of galaxies .",
    "indeed , by measuring the gravitomagnetic time delay one can determine the total angular momentum of the rotating body and thus , by estimating the contribution of the visible part , one can determine its dark - matter content .",
    "these estimates are preliminary because we need to apply the gravitomagnetic time delay to some particular , known , gravitational - lensing images .",
    "furthermore , we need to estimate the size and the possibility of modeling of the other sources of time delay . nevertheless ,",
    "depending on the geometry of the astrophysical system considered , we conclude that the relative gravitomagnetic time delay may be an already observable effect .",
