    "to investigate the theory of everything which explains gravity and quantum theory in a consistent way , several candidates have been proposed @xcite with string theory being one of the most competitive ideas @xcite .",
    "string theory can explain not only the finite quantum interactions of gravitons but also the possible modifications of gravity and matter sectors @xcite . such modified gravity models or additional matter contents",
    "are useful to study various topics , for example inflationary and late time cosmology @xcite , black hole physics and applications to ads / cft @xcite or astrophysical applications @xcite etc . moreover ,",
    "if string theory is the correct model of quantum gravity then such modifications should explain various traditional problems of gravity , e.g. , the singularity problem of black holes @xcite or cosmology @xcite .",
    "a typical modification via string theory is the existence of a dilaton field @xcite .",
    "this is in fact the same as the brans - dicke field @xcite which controls the interaction coupling strengths .",
    "the kinetic term and the potential term of the brans - dicke field can be changed by a conformal transformation from the string frame ( or the jordan frame ) to the einstein frame and is equivalent to a canonical scalar field model in the einstein frame @xcite . however ,",
    "if the model couples to other interactions , then the matter sector is no longer canonical after the conformal transformation , an interesting example of which is the gauge field . in section  [ sec : gen ] , we summarize various types of string effective actions and the different types of interactions they generate between the dilaton field and the gauge field .    in this paper , we want to investigate responses of the brans - dicke field that depend on couplings between the brans - dicke field and the gauge field .",
    "naively speaking , they will form charged black holes and there are already a lot of papers which investigate stationary solutions @xcite . however , in general the dynamics will be complicated for realistic gravitational collapses . for such cases we expect complicated phenomena such as :    * _ causal structure : _ in the general string frame ( jordan frame ) , the null energy condition can be violated and hence the dynamics of locally defined horizons @xcite can be complicated .",
    "in addition , the existence of the central singularity and the cauchy horizon curvature singularity @xcite should be affected by the dynamics of the brans - dicke field .",
    "* _ response of the brans - dicke field : _ already some solutions are known which violate the assumptions of the no - hair theorem @xcite . however , is it be possible to form scalar hairs from gravitational collapses ?",
    "for neutral black holes it was investigated by @xcite , but the responses due to the charge can cause quite different phenomena .",
    "this may be related to the destabilization of the moduli / dilaton field that should be controlled by a proper potential and may have observational implications @xcite .",
    "we will mainly focus these two topics by using numerical techniques applied to the double - null formalism . to the best knowledge of the authors , the double - null formalism is one of the most efficient techniques to investigate the interior of the black holes @xcite and",
    "we have priviously used this approach with good success @xcite .",
    "there are some previous works regarding string - inspired models using the double - null formalism @xcite and other methods @xcite as well as the authors previous works @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will investigate a wide parameter space , for example , we will cover not only directly string - inspired models , but also indirectly string - inspired models ( @xmath0 inspired model @xcite ) as well as natural generalizations of the parameters , e.g. , the ghost limit .    in fact , our potential parameter space is huge and can give rise to a wide range of setups , for example :    * _ model dependence _ : type  i , type  ii , heterotic , or braneworld inspired models , etc .",
    "* _ potential dependence _ : whether there is a potential that stabilizes the moduli or dilaton field or not @xcite . * _ asymptotic conditions _ : de sitter , minkowski , or anti de sitter @xcite . * _ symmetries _ : spherical , planar , hyperbolic , or other symmetries @xcite . * _ dimensions _ : 3 , 4 , or @xmath1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "although some of these topics were already investigated by the authors and others , still there are many interesting and various topics to be studied . in this paper",
    ", we will limit our focus to the basic model dependence with no dilaton potential , asymptotic flat , spherical symmetry and four dimensions , hence the paper s subtitle : `` _ _ i .",

    "furthermore , it is interesting to change the asymptotic cosmological constant and different symmetries .",
    "the variation of dimensions and their semi - classical responses will be also interesting to study .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this paper , but will be investigated in future works .",
    "apart from the physics involved , this paper is by itself important by it s technical merit , since this is a quite generalized and complicated implementation of the double - null formalism .",
    "we are sure that there are many more variations to be made from this numerical technique and that this paper is an important step towards further useful or realistic string - inspired models .",
    "we hope that this paper can be a leading paper that will introduce upcoming papers .",

    "[ sec : dis ] , we summarize and discuss future issues . finally , in the appendices , we comment on basics of mass inflation ( appendix a ) , the consistency and convergence of our numerical scheme ( appendix b ) and present a catalog of simulations for various initial conditions ( appendix c ) .",

    "as we will see below , @xmath6 and @xmath8 in particular are model depent .",
    "of course , this model is limited up to order @xmath5 and hence does not correspond to real string theory , since the real theory should contain all possible interactions , including higher order curvature corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "this model is sufficiently general to cover a lot of string inspired models and thus provide important intuitions concerning dynamical black hole physics .",

    "this can be transformed by redefining @xmath12 , such as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath15 dimensional gravitation constant .",

    ".    in general , there will be higher order loop corrections to the low energy effective action .",

    "therefore , the coupling should be field dependent and hence , quite large ranges of @xmath6 can be covered by string - inspired models .

    "the @xmath43 case is unique and in this case , there is no back - reactions to the brans - dicke field and hence there is no dependence on @xmath6 ( the four figures in figure  [ fig : neutral_beta1 ] are the same , bar numerical errors ) .",
    "causal structure for charged black holes with @xmath135 . ]    as we observed in a previous paper @xcite , if @xmath143 , then during the gravitational collapse , the brans - dicke field is pushed to @xmath145 limit and after the collapse , the pushed field is repulsed and approaches the stationary limit . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath146 , then brans - dicke is pushed to @xmath147 limit during gravitational collapses and approaches the stationary limit .",
    "because of this behaviour , there appears not only the apparent horizon @xmath136 , but also @xmath137 for @xmath143 .",
    "in addition , the apparent horizon can show strong oscillations for @xmath146 and perhaps it can create a cauchy horizon as a naked singularity . as @xmath148 decreases , the back - reaction decreases .",
    "this is clear , if we observe the location of @xmath137 horizons or the oscillations of the apparent horizon @xmath136 and compare with the @xmath30 case and the @xmath38 ; they tend to disappear , where these phenomena are the typical behaviors which are due to the brans - dicke field .",
    "we summarize the possible charge - less causal structures , inferred from our simulations , in figure  [ fig : classification ] . for @xmath143 ,",

    "the oscillations of the apparent horizon @xmath136 depends on the number of peaks of the initial collapsing field ( see ( b ) and figure  [ fig : tvv_beta0 ] in appendix  c , and compare with figure  5 of @xcite ) .",

    "the excessive charge will be repelled outside the horizon and the excessive charge is either repelled to future infinity or forms a stable charge cloud outside the horizon @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) for @xmath143 and @xmath154 or @xmath133 , there is no cauchy horizon ( ( h ) of figure  [ fig : causal ] ) .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath146 and @xmath38 or @xmath133 cases , the gravitational collapse can induce inflation ( ( i ) of figure  [ fig : causal ] ) .",
    "if the final point of @xmath137 in the @xmath151 limit ( green dot in ( i ) ) does not meet the spacelike future infinity , then there will be a cauchy horizon in the @xmath151 limit .",
    "causal structures for charged black holes . ]    plots of @xmath4 for @xmath135 . ]",
    "the brans - dicke field equation is @xmath141 where @xmath155 note that we can approximately write this as follows : @xmath156 the kinetic terms mainly contribute _ during _ the gravitational collapse ( i.e. in our simulations for @xmath157 ) , while the charge terms will contribute _ after _ the gravitational collapse ( i.e. in our simulations for @xmath158 ) and _ outside _ the apparent horizon . outside the black hole ,",
    "the charge term will remain since the charge is a conserved quantity , while the kinetic term will disappear as the gravitational collapse ends .",
    "if we keep this in mind , then for the @xmath30 case , there will be essentially no effects after the gravitational collapse and the outside the horizon .",
    "in other words , the brans - dicke hair will decay as time goes on and approach a stationary limit , figure  [ fig : bd_beta0 ] shows such behaviors . on the other hand ,",
    "in the @xmath140 limit , there will be almost no back - reaction to the brans - dicke field during the gravitational collapse ; only after the gravitational collapse has finished will the brans - dicke field be affected .",

    "plots showing the brans - dicke field @xmath4 for @xmath140 . ]",
    "if @xmath159 , then one can see both effects simultaneously , such behaviour is shown in figure  [ fig : bd_beta05 ] ; one can see the contrast between during ( @xmath160 ) and after ( @xmath161 ) the gravitational collapse , which is different from the cases of @xmath30 and @xmath43 .    now let us think about the directions of the brans - dicke fields , whether it becomes greater or less than one . for @xmath143 , if the term @xmath144 is positive , it will push the brans - dicke field to the strong coupling limit ( @xmath145 ) ; if it is negative , then it will push to the weak coupling limit ( @xmath147 ) . to summarize",
    ":     : :    effects of kinetic terms : if @xmath162 and    @xmath143 , then the kinetic terms always push the    brans - dicke field to the strong coupling limit .",
    " : :    effects of charge terms : if @xmath163 and    @xmath143 , then the charge terms always push the    brans - dicke field to the weak coupling limit .    for the other cases ( e.g. , @xmath146 ) , opposite behaviors will be observed .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical results shown in figures  [ fig : bd_beta0 ] , [ fig : bd_beta05 ] and [ fig : bd_beta1 ] . for @xmath164 and @xmath143 , during the gravitational collapse , @xmath145 appears ( shifts to blue color ) except @xmath43 .",
    "after the gravitational collapse , always we have @xmath147 ( shifts to red color ) except for @xmath30 . in particular we can see both phenomena at the same time for the case of @xmath139 . if @xmath146 , then all behaviors are opposite .",
    "we can summarize our results ( for @xmath143 ) as follows :     @xmath165 : : :    all effects push the brans - dicke field to the strong coupling limit .",
    "as time goes on , the brans - dicke hair will be formed in the strong    coupling direction .",
    " @xmath30 : : :    the brans - dicke field is pushed to the strong coupling limit , but only    dynamically .",
    "as time goes on , the brans - dicke hair will disappear in    the stationary limit .",
    " @xmath159 : : :    the brans - dicke field is pushed to the strong coupling limit    dynamically . on the other hand , as time goes on , the brans - dicke hair    will be formed in the weak coupling direction .",
    " @xmath43 : : :    the brans - dicke field does not affected by gravitational collapse .",
    "however , as time goes on , the brans - dicke hair will be formed in the    weak coupling direction .",
    " @xmath166 : : :    all effects push the brans - dicke field to the weak coupling limit .    one final comment should be made regarding the no - hair theorem in the einstein frame . we know that for a quite general class of models , the no - hair theorem should be satisfied in the einstein frame ,",
    "hence , there should be no scalar hair in the stationary limit .",
    "if this is the case in the einstein frame , then there should be no hair in the jordan frame , too @xcite .",
    "however , our model is consistent with these general discussions .",
    "after we change the einstein frame , the matter sector lagrangian has a non - trivial coupling between the matter field and the brans - dicke field : so to speak , @xmath167 , unless @xmath30 .",
    "this violates the assumptions of @xcite and it explains why a non - trivial scalar hair appears after the gravitational collapse has finished .",
    "furthermore , we can consistently observe that there is no scalar hair after the gravitational collapses for the @xmath30 case .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated charged black holes of string - inspired gravity models .",
    "two parameters are important : the brans - dicke parameter @xmath6 and the coupling between the brans - dicke field and the gauge field @xmath8 .",
    "this model covers lots of string - inspired models : the dilaton gravity @xmath16 with type  iia ( @xmath30 ) , type  i ( @xmath38 ) , heterotic ( @xmath43 ) , some braneworld inspired models @xmath143 and @xmath0 inspired models @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , we investigated the ghost limit @xmath146 .",
    "we used numerical techniques with double - null formalism to numerically solve the dynamic equations .",
    "we have focused on the causal structures and responses of the brans - dicke field , especially reactions via charges . for usual non - ghost limit",
    "@xmath143 , the direction of the response of the brans - dicke field , whether biased to strong coupling limit or weak coupling limit , is determined by @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath43 , then there is no response of the brans - dicke field during the gravitational collapse ; if @xmath30 , then there is no response of the brans - dicke field via charges after a black hole is formed .",
    "this means that after the gravitational collapse , as long as @xmath163 , the brans - dicke field will be biased to the weak coupling limit .",
    "this is very crucial in order to understand the nature of charged black holes for @xmath163 .",
    "an important point is that in general such a black hole will have brans - dicke hair .",
    "another important point is that the brans - dicke field is biased to the weak coupling limit and this will _ screen _ the charge inside the horizon .",
    "therefore , this explains the absence of the cauchy horizon , while it exists for the @xmath30 case .",
    "however , we did not try to control the brans - dicke field using a potential and hence further points to be clarified , this issue will be studied in a future paper _ ii _ , which will focus on mass inflation and dependence on parameters and potentials .",
    "however , the current paper suggests that there are are many other parameters and issues which will be interesting to study .",
    "although not a string - inspired model per se , the @xmath146 and @xmath163 cases are also interesting in the sense that a charged matter collapse can induce inflation , while the outside still does not inflate .",
    "so , as long as the theory allows for the existence of ghosts , the formation of a ( at least one - way traversable ) wormhole does not require complicated initial conditions . of course , the existence of the ghost may be accompanied by complicated instabilities and this calls for further investigations . a detailed study of this issue is also postponed to a future paper .",
    "to see , not only outside , but also inside the black hole and to study the detailed relations between gravity and various field contents , probably the best way is to use the double - null formalism .",
    "the authors hope that this paper will be an important step to prepare for upcoming investigations of diverse and various interesting topics , including the interests of theoretical gravity , string theory , holography , astrophysical applications , as well as cosmology , by varying matter , dimensions , gravity model , and symmetry , etc .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly review mass inflation in einstein gravity .",
    "mass inflation is a typical phenomenon of a deep inside of a charged black hole .",
    "let us begin from a static charged black hole solution , so - called the reissner - nordstrom solution @xcite : @xmath168 where @xmath169 .",
    "this solution has two horizons : @xmath170 with asymptotic mass @xmath171 and charge @xmath172 ( if @xmath173 ) .",
    "we show that the inner horizon is unstable up to a small perturbation , in the sense that a local observer near the inner horizon who sees a small perturbation can experience an exponential growth of the energy density .    for an in - going matter pulse ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be approximated by @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 is so - called the luminosity function that should be proportional to @xmath176 with a certain constant @xmath177 for a realistic matter @xcite .",
    "now , when there is an out - going observer who sees the in - going matter pulse , the observer measures the energy density @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the null geodesic of the out - going observer .",
    "note that @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the surface gravity of the inner horizon and @xmath182 is the affine parameter of the observer @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy density becomes @xmath183 this is so - called mass inflation .",
    "first , this implies that the inner horizon of the reissner - nordstrom solution is unstable via a small perturbation @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we consider gravitational collapses , we can not trust the reissner - nordstrom solution for the internal causal structure and the internal structure is dramatically changed @xcite .",
    "this necessarily requires numerical simulations .",
    "secondly , as the local energy function exponentially increases , other curvature quantities also exponentially increases @xcite . in the end ,",
    "the inner horizon becomes a physical curvature singularity with a non - zero area , where the singularity is null for classical cases , while space - like with semi - classical back - reactions @xcite . in terms of double - null coordinates ,",
    "mass inflation is usually identified by the behavior of the metric function @xmath75 ( when we use the double - null metric @xmath184 ) ; @xmath75 exponentially decreases , i.e. , @xmath185 with a constant @xmath186 .",
    "this was repeatedly observed by numerical simulations @xcite . in the extremely small @xmath75 limit ,",
    "all curvature quantities ( ricci scalar , kretchmann scalar , etc . )",
    "behave like @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) and hence curvatures exponentially diverge .",
    "all of these descriptions are on mass inflation in einstein gravity . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a complicated coupling with charge , matter , and gravity , then these expectations can be modified and this is one important motivation of this paper .",
    "in this appendix , we demonstrate that 1 ) our numerical solutions are converging when including the effects of nontrivial parameters and scalar fields and 2 ) that the converged numerical solution is indeed a solution which satisfies the constraint equations .",
    "the results presented here are very similar to those presented in @xcite which is not surprising , since the code in that paper and this one are essentially identical .",
    "for this reason we refer to that paper and references therein ( especially , @xcite ) , for further details of the numerical schemes and other details related to the design of the code .",
    "the initial conditions and computational domain for the tests in this appendix are similar to those used for making figures  [ fig : charge_beta0 ] and [ fig : bd_beta0 ] for the @xmath189 , @xmath150 , @xmath135 case .",
    "this setup is clearly non - trivial and is thus a good test for the general convergence properties of our code .",
    "our computational domain for this convergence tests is , as for figure  [ fig : causal ] , in the range @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "next we demonstrate the convergence of the code by comparing a series of simulations with varying numerical resolution . for the tests in this appendix ,",
    "we do a total of six simulations , with each simulation changing the base resolution .",
    "to limit the number of plots , we concentrate on displaying convergence results along the line @xmath190 , which is well inside the apparent horizon and passes through a region with very complex behaviors ( cf .",
    "figures  [ fig : charge_beta0 ] and [ fig : bd_beta0 ] ) .",
    "thus , if we see convergence here , it is a fair indication that convergence requirements are satisfied throughout the whole of the computational domain .    along this line ( @xmath190 ) , we calculate the relative convergence between two simulations ( one with a numerical resolution twice that of the other ) relative to a simulation with very high resolution : @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes the dynamic variable @xmath193 at the @xmath194-th grid point of simulation with resolution @xmath195 and where @xmath196 denotes the dynamic variable of the same @xmath194-th point for a simulation with the highest numerical resolution done by us .",
    "obviously , this expression only makes sense for those @xmath194 points that coincide in all simulations .",
    "the first six plots in figure  [ fig : convergence ] show the relative convergence , @xmath197 , for the dynamic variables @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath4 , re  @xmath45 , i m  @xmath45 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the lines in the figures are marked by their numerical resolution measured in terms of the most coarse resolution @xmath198 , the high resolution simulation used to calculate expression equation  ( [ eq : xidef ] ) , has a numerical resolution of @xmath199 times the base resolution , i.e. , @xmath200 .    from these figures , it is clear that the dynamic variables are converging for simulations of increasing resolution .",
    "furthermore , since we plot the _ relative _ convergence of the dynamic variables , we see that the relative change between the two highest resolution simulations show that the variables change on the order of @xmath201 or less , which we considered a quite acceptable .",
    "it is , however , not enough to demonstrate that the simulations are converging , they must also converge to a ` _ _ physical _ _ '",
    "solution , i.e. , the residuals of the constraint equations ( equations  ( [ eq : e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2 ] ) ) must converge to zero . to demonstrate this , we calculate the relative convergence of the constraint equation residuals , ( relative to the einstein - tensor ) in a similar way to equation  ( [ eq : xidef ] ) : @xmath202 where @xmath203 denotes the residual of the constraint equation ( @xmath204 or @xmath205 ) , at the @xmath194-th point for simulation with resolution @xmath195 and where @xmath206 denotes the corresponding einstein - tensor component ( @xmath207 or @xmath208 respectively ) at the same point .",
    "the relative convergence of the residuals of the constraint equations are demonstrated in the bottom two plots of figure  [ fig : convergence ] , where it is seen that they converge towards zero for higher resolution simulations .",
    "this indicates that not only are the numerical solutions converging for simulations of higher resolution , but that they are indeed converging towards a physical solution .",
    "finally , it is emphasized that the results presented in this appendix are not the only convergence tests that we have performed , they are merely representative of typical convergence behavior . for all results presented in this paper , we have performed a large number of simulations with varying resolutions to ensure that the results had converged to their physical solution .    relative convergence of the dynamic variables and constraint equations along line of @xmath190 for simulation with parameters : @xmath189 , @xmath150 and @xmath135 .",

    "note that around the apparent horizon @xmath211 , @xmath212 and hence , for an out - going observer , if @xmath213 , then the @xmath136 horizon changes the sign of @xmath214 from @xmath215 to @xmath216 , while @xmath217 , changes the sign of @xmath214 from @xmath216 to @xmath215 .",
