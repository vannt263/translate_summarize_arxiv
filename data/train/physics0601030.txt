    "as it is well known , the behavior of the light reflected at the boundary between two dielectrics drastically depends on whether the associated electric field lies parallel ( @xmath0 polarization ) or perpendicular ( @xmath1 polarization ) to the plane of incidence .",
    "this is quantified by the fresnel formulas  @xcite , which also confirm that at a certain angle @xmath2 the @xmath0-polarized field drops to zero .",
    "this angle is commonly referred to as the brewster angle and , in spite of its simplicity , it is a crucial concept in the optics of reflection  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this notion is at the heart of a number of methods for optical thin - film characterization .",
    "these include brewster - angle microscopy  @xcite , which furnishes a direct visualization of the morphology of the film , or the abels brewster - angle method  @xcite for determining the refractive index .",
    "they are quite popular because are noncontact , easy to set up and simple to use .",
    "the basic idea can be concisely stated as follows : coated and bare regions of a substrate are illuminated with @xmath0-polarized light and the angle of incidence is scanned for a reflectance - match angle .",
    "visual observation is often used because it reveals local variations in film thickness and in homogeneity of refractive index .",
    "these techniques rely on the dependence of reflectance near the brewster angle on the refractive indices involved .",
    "of course , one could rightly argue that all the relevant information is contained in the fresnel formulas .",
    "however , given their nonlinear features , no physical insights on the behavior around @xmath2 can be easily inferred , nor an analysis of the error sources can be easily carried out , except by numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "some qualitative comments can be found scattered in the literature : for example , it is sometimes argued that the amplitude reflection coefficient for @xmath0 polarization is approximately linear around @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we think that a comprehensive study of the reflectance near the brewster angle behavior is missing and it is precisely the main goal of this paper .    to this end , we propose to look formally at the reflectance as a probability distribution and focus on its central moments , which leads us to introduce very natural measures of the width and the skewness of that peak through the second and third moments  @xcite .",
    "since all these calculations must be performed only in a neighborhood of @xmath2 , we replace the exact reflectance by a pad approximant  @xcite : apart from the elegance of this approach , it is sometimes mysterious how well this can work .",
    "in addition , we can then compute the relevant parameters in a closed way and deduce their variation with the refractive indices .",
    "this program is carried out in section  [ inter ] for a single interface and in section  [ layer ] for a homogeneous slab .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  [ con ] .",
    "let two homogeneous isotropic semi - infinite dielectric media , described by real refractive indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , be separated by a plane boundary .",
    "we assume an incident monochromatic , linearly polarized plane wave from medium 0 , which makes an angle @xmath5 with the normal to the interface and has amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "this wave splits into a reflected wave @xmath7 in medium 0 , and a transmitted wave @xmath8 in medium 1 that makes an angle @xmath9 with the normal .",
    "the angles of incidence @xmath5 and refraction @xmath9 are related by snell s law .",
    "the wave vectors of all waves lie in the plane of incidence . when the incident fields are @xmath0 or @xmath1 polarized , all plane waves excited by the incident ones have the same polarization , so both basic polarizations can be treated separately . by demanding that the tangential components of @xmath10 and @xmath11 should be continuous across the boundary , and assuming nonmagnetic media , the reflection and transmission amplitudes are given by  @xcite    [ rs ] r_s & = & = , + & & + [ rp ] r_p & = & = .",
    "these are the famous fresnel formulas , represented in fig .  1 and whose physical content is discussed in any optics textbook .",
    "the brewster angle occurs when @xmath12 , which immediately gives the condition @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the relative refractive index . without loss of generality ,",
    "in the rest of this section we assume @xmath15 and then @xmath16 .",
    "also , we deal exclusively with @xmath0 polarization and drop the corresponding subscript everywhere .    to treat the reflectance @xmath17 near the brewster angle it proves convenient to use @xmath18 which is the angle of incidence centered at @xmath2 . since we are interested only in a local study , we take into account only a small interval around @xmath2 ; that is , angles from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the length of this interval is largely an arbitrary matter : we shall take henceforth @xmath21 , although the analysis is largely independent of this choice .    to quantify the peak near the brewster angle",
    ", we treat the reflectance as a probability distribution in the interval @xmath22 $ ] and borrow some well - established concepts from statistics  @xcite . in this manner",
    "we define @xmath23 for a symmetric peak @xmath24 , while the fact that @xmath25 reveals an intrinsic asymmetry .",
    "the central moments are @xmath26 and , as it happens for @xmath27 , they are functions of the refractive index @xmath28 .",
    "the second moment is a measure of the width of the distribution , while the third moment can be immediately related with a lack of symmetry .",
    "more concretely , we take the width and the skewness of the brewster peak as    w & = & 2 , + & & + & = & .    of course , these parameters can be computed numerically by using the fresnel formulas . however , since we are working in a small neighborhood of @xmath2 , it seems more convenient to work with some local approximation to @xmath29 ( and therefore to @xmath30 ) . here , we resort to pad approximants ( to maintain the paper as self - contained as possible , in the appendix we briefly recall the essentials of such an approach ) .",
    "after some calculations , the approximations to the reflection coefficient @xmath29 turn out to be    [ padelmboun ] r^[1/0 ] & = & , + r^[2/0 ] & = & + & - & , + r^[1/1 ] & = & ,    whence one immediately gets the corresponding reflectances as @xmath31 } = |r^{[l / m]}|^2 $ ] , which have been plotted in fig .",
    "2 . as we can see",
    ", the term @xmath32}$ ] reproduces the exact reflectance only in a very small interval .",
    "the next polynomial approximation @xmath33}$ ] improves a little bit the situation , but fails again as soon we are , say @xmath34 away from @xmath2 . on the contrary , the diagonal pad @xmath35}$ ]",
    "fits remarkably well with the exact behavior .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath35}$ ] provides an excellent approximation and we use it in subsequent calculations .",
    "an additional and remarkable advantage of @xmath35}$ ] is that the central moments @xmath36 can be expressed in a closed analytical form . in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the width @xmath37 as a function of the refractive index @xmath28 ( lower curve ) .",
    "we have also computed @xmath37 by numerically integrating the fresnel formulas : no appreciable differences can be noticed .",
    "the width has a maximum that can be calculated by imposing @xmath38 , which immediately gives @xmath39 . beyond this value",
    ", @xmath37 decreases almost linearly with @xmath28 .",
    "however , for the range of indices plotted in the figure , this variation is smooth , with a total change in @xmath37 of around @xmath40 .    in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted the skewness @xmath41 in terms of @xmath28 .",
    "this parameter is always negative what , for a peak , means that the left tail is less pronounced than the right tail .",
    "there is again a maximum in the skewness that can be calculated by imposing @xmath42 .",
    "however , one can check that @xmath43 for all the values of @xmath28 , so that @xmath44 : this maximum coincides then with that of @xmath37 .",
    "apart from a scale factor , @xmath41 shows an aspect quite similar to that of @xmath37 .",
    "we focus our attention now on a homogeneous , isotropic dielectric slab of refractive index @xmath28 and thickness @xmath45 imbedded in air and illuminated with monochromatic light ( the case when the slab lies on a substrate can be dealt with much in the same way ) .",
    "a standard calculation gives the following amplitude reflection coefficient for the slab  @xcite @xmath46 } { 1- r^2   \\exp(- i 2 \\beta ) } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the fresnel reflection coefficient at the interface air - medium ( which again will be considered for @xmath0 polarization only ) and @xmath47 is the slab phase thickness @xmath48 here @xmath45 is the thickness , @xmath49 the wavelength in vacuo of the incident radiation and @xmath5 the angle of incidence .",
    "this coefficient @xmath50 presents a typical periodic variation with the slab phase thickness @xmath47 .",
    "apart from that dependence , it is obvious that @xmath51 when @xmath52 ; i. e. , precisely at the brewster angle for the interface air - medium .",
    "however , the form of this reflectance peak , calculated now as @xmath53 differs from the case of a single interface , since ( [ rlam ] ) is more involved than ( [ rp ] ) .",
    "although the analysis can be carried out for any value of @xmath45 such that @xmath54 , for definiteness and to avoid as much as possible any spurious detail , we take @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "5 we have plotted the exact form of the reflectance for this thickness , as a function of the local angle of incidence , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ locinc ] ) , for several values of @xmath28    instead of eq .",
    "( [ rlam ] ) , we use again a pad approximant of order @xmath56 $ ] , which can be written as @xmath57 } = \\frac{p_1 \\vartheta}{1 + q_1 \\vartheta}\\ ] ] where    p_1 & = & i e^-i , + & & + q_1 & = & - ,    and @xmath58 with this approximation , that still reproduces pretty well the exact reflectance , we have analytically obtained @xmath37 and @xmath41 for the slab .",
    "the results are plotted in the upper curves of figs .  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "for high values of @xmath28 , the reflectance peak for the slab essentially coincides with that for the interface .",
    "differences are only noticeable for small values of @xmath28 . in fact , the maximum of @xmath37 can be evaluated by imposing @xmath38 , whose numerical solution gives @xmath59 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath41 is quite similar , because here we have also that @xmath60 for all the values of @xmath28 .",
    "in summary , we have presented a simple and comprehensive treatment of the reflectance near the brewster angle . by combining the notions of width and skewness with pad approximants",
    ", we have fully characterized this reflectance peak .",
    "we hope that these results fill a gap for a full understanding of the brewster angle .",
    "we thank juan j. monzn for many inspiring discussions and for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "a pad approximant is a rational function ( of a specified order ) such that its power series expansion agrees with a given power series to the highest possible order . in other words , let us define @xmath61 } ( x ) = \\frac{p_l ( x)}{q_m ( x ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are polynomials of degrees @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively :          for @xmath70 .",
    "these conditions furnish @xmath71 equations for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the coefficients can be found by noticing that eqs .",
    "( [ proppad ] ) are equivalent to @xmath74 up to terms of order @xmath75 .",
    "this gives directly the following set of equations : @xmath76 solving this directly gives    @xmath61 } ( x ) = \\frac { \\left | \\begin{array}{cccc } f_{l - m+1 } & f_{l - m+2 } & \\ldots & f_{l+1 } \\\\",
