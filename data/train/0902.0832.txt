    ", studies of hyperon energies in nuclear matter naturally complement our knowledge of hypernuclei ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "for example , the eos of hypermatter is useful in the development of generalized mass formulas depending on density and hyperon fraction @xcite . from the experimental side ,",
    "additional data are very much needed , especially on @xmath1 hypernuclei , which would provide information on the @xmath2 interaction . concerning single hypernuclei ,",
    "analyses of data on @xmath0 binding energies constrain the depth of the single-@xmath0 potential to be 27 - 30 mev @xcite .",
    "the status of @xmath3 hypernuclei and the @xmath3-nucleus potential is more controversial ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "microscopic calculations of nuclear matter properties including hyperons have been reported earlier within the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock framework ( bhf ) ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , using the nijmegen @xcite nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) meson - exchange potential .",
    "extensive microscopic work on hyperonic nuclear matter , again within the non - relativistic bhf framework , has also been published by the barcelona group ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is one purpose of the present work to bring in the new aspect of dirac effects on the @xmath0 hyperon as well as the nucleon . by ",
    "dirac effects \" we mean that the single - baryon wavefunction is calculated self - consistently with the appropriate effective interaction .",
    "the importance of these effects on the nucleonic equation of state can not be overestimated @xcite .",
    "they can be seen both as relativistic effects and three - body forces originating from nucleon - antinucleon excitations , and provide an essential saturation mechanism missing from conventional approaches .",
    "our previous calculation @xcite of the binding energy of a @xmath0 impurity in nuclear matter showed that dirac effects on the @xmath0 hyperon yield a moderate reduction of the binding energy . in that calculation",
    ", we used the most recent nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) potential reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( thereafter referred to as ny05 ) , and observed that @xmath4-matrix predictions obtained with ny05 are significantly differerent from calculations using the previous ( energy independent ) version of the jlich ny potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we will use both potentials , for comparison .",
    "the bonn b potential @xcite is used throughout for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) part .",
    "previous calculations of the eos with hyperons have typically been conducted within a non - relativistic framework together with r - space local ny potentials .",
    "our approach uses non - local relativistic momentum - space ( nn and ny ) potentials and a relativistic many - body method , and is therefore fundamentally different .",
    "the baseline work for our eos s was developed in ref .",
    "the framework described there for isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter has been further expanded and adjusted to include other species of baryons in different concentrations .",
    "our latest eoss for the nn sector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe some technical aspects of the calculation .",
    "we then proceed to present and discuss our results ( section 3 ) .",
    "conclusions and future plans are summarized in section 4 .",
    "for a total density of baryons ( nucleons and @xmath0 s ) , @xmath5 , and some specified @xmath0 fraction , @xmath6 , the densities of each species are known and are related to their respective fermi momenta by @xmath7    for a nucleon and a @xmath0 with momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the total and relative momenta are @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 equal to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath15    clearly , for the case of two nucleons we have @xmath16 the single - nucleon and single-@xmath0 potentials are obtained as @xmath17 and @xmath18 i.e. , the @xmath1 interaction is neglected . in the equations above ,",
    "the various terms , @xmath19 , are the contributions to the potential of baryon @xmath20 from its interation with all baryons of type @xmath21 .",
    "they are given by @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 where the channel isospin @xmath25 can be 0 or 1 for the nn case and is equal to 1/2 for the @xmath26 case , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are the spin and isospin of the nucleon or @xmath0 .",
    "notice that @xmath29 an approximation often used in mean - field approaches .",
    "the average potential energies of nucleons and @xmath0 s are determined from @xmath30 and @xmath31 where the factors of 4 and 2 in eqs .  ( 11 ) and eq .",
    "( 12 ) , respectively , account for protons and neutrons in both spin states or @xmath0 s in both spin states .",
    "finally the average potential energy per baryon is obtained as @xmath32 from which , together with a similar expression for the kinetic energy , one obtains the average energy per baryon .    the n@xmath0 @xmath4-matrix is obtained from the bethe - goldstone equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the starting energy and the energy of the intermediate ny state , respectively , and @xmath36 is an energy - independent ny potential .    for two particles with masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 and fermi momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 , pauli blocking requires @xmath41 the above condition implies the restriction @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angle between the total ( @xmath44 ) and the relative ( @xmath45 ) momenta of the two particles , and @xmath46 .",
    "angle - averaging is then applied in the usual way .    in the present calculation",
    "we consider a non - vanishing density of @xmath0 s but do not allow for the presence of real @xmath3 s in the medium ( although both @xmath0 and @xmath3 are included in the coupled - channel calculation of the ny @xmath4-matrix , see eq .",
    "essentially we are considering a scenario where a small fraction of nucleons is replaced with @xmath0 s , as could be accomplished by an experiment aimed at producing multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "multistrange systems , such as those produced in heavy - ion collisions , may of course contain other hyperons on the outset . for small @xmath0 densities ,",
    "though , as those we consider here , the cascade ( @xmath47 ) and the @xmath3 hyperon are expected to decay quickly through the strong processes @xmath48 and @xmath49 . under these conditions , a mixture of nucleons and @xmath0 s can be considered ",
    "metastable \" , in the sense of being equilibrated over a time scale which is long relative to strong processes @xcite .",
    "( in fact , the strong reactions mentioned above would have to be pauli blocked in order to produce a metastable multistrange system @xcite . )",
    "we neglect the @xmath50 interaction , as very little is known about it .",
    "furthermore , non - local momentum - space @xmath51 potentials , appropriate for our dbhf framework , are not available at this time . for these reasons",
    ", we keep the @xmath0 concentration relatively low .",
    "the relation between the non - relativistic brueckner approach and the relativistic framework ( known as dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock , dbhf ) has been discussed for a long time . already in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how relativistic effects tie in with virtual excitations of pair terms . lately , these concepts have been revisited @xcite with similar conclusions . in short ,",
    "the dirac effect on the eos of nucleonic matter is an essential saturating , and strongly density dependent , mechanism , which effectively accounts for the class of three - body forces originating from virtual nucleon - antinucleon excitations .",
    "when hyperon degrees of freedom are included , for reasons of consistency , those should then be subjected to the same correction .",
    "we have incorporated dbhf effects in the @xmath0 matter calculation , which amounts to involving the @xmath0 single - particle dirac wave function in the self - consistent calculation through the @xmath0 effective mass , @xmath52 .",
    "similarly to what is done for nucleons in ref .",
    "@xcite , we fit the single - particle energy for @xmath0 s using the ansatz @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the scalar and vector potentials of the @xmath0 baryon , which we assume to be momentum independent .",
    "note the single - particle energy is the sum of the single - particle potential , for which we use the two - parameter ansatz , @xmath57 and the expectation value of the free energy operator in the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "because of the small hyperon concentrations considered here , the parameters of the single nucleon potential are taken from a separate calculation of symmetric nuclear matter @xcite performed at densities corresponding to the nucleon densities , @xmath58 in eq .",
    "this amounts to saying that , for low hyperon concentrations , the main correction to the single nucleon potential comes from the presence of the first term in eq.(5 ) .",
    "the parameters of the single @xmath0 potential are fitted , self - consistently with the @xmath26 @xmath4-matrix , at momenta close to its fermi surface , specifically @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "a problem with the jlich ny potential in conjunction with dbhf calculations is the use of the pseudoscalar coupling for the interactions of pseudoscalar mesons ( pions and kaons ) with nucleons and hyperons . for the reasons mentioned above ( that is , the close relationship between dirac effects and  z - diagram \" contributions )",
    ", this relativistic correction is known to become unreasonably large when applied to a vertex involving pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "on the other hand , the gradient ( pseudovector ) coupling ( also supported by chiral symmetry arguments ) largely suppresses antiparticle contributions . to resolve this problem",
    ", one can make use of the on - shell equivalence between the pseudoscalar and the pseudovector coupling , which amounts to relating the coupling constants as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the pseudoscalar coupling constant and @xmath63 the pseudovector one ; @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the masses of the pseudoscalar meson and the two baryons involved in the vertex , respectively",
    ". this procedure can be made plausible by writing down the appropriate one - boson - exchange amplitudes and observing that , redefining the coupling constants as above , we have ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the two - nucleon case ) @xmath67 where the ellipsis stands for off - shell contributions .",
    "thus , the pseudoscalar coupling can be interpreted as pseudovector coupling where the off - shell terms are ignored .",
    "this is what we apply in our dbhf calculations .    in the coupled channel calculation ,",
    "evaluation of @xmath68 involves the transition potentials @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( all with total channel isospin equal to 1/2 ) , plus the corresponding exchange diagrams . because in the present scenario the @xmath3 hyperon is not given an effective mass , dirac effects are applied only in @xmath72 .",
    "a diagram where not all of the baryon lines are dirac - modified may yield a dirac effect that is artificially skewed .    finally , a comment is in place concerning meson propagators . in standard dbhf calculations @xcite , the so - called thompson equation ( a relativistic three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation )",
    "is used for two - baryon scattering . in the thompson formalism ,",
    "static propagators are employed for meson exchange , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the mass of the exchanged meson and @xmath75 are the baryon momenta in their center - of - mass frame before and after scattering . the jlich ny potentials are based upon time - ordered perturbation theory @xcite and use a meson propagator given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 are baryon energies and @xmath80 is the starting energy of the two - baryon system . in order to eliminate the energy dependence , reuber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite replaced the original @xmath80 with @xmath81 where the @xmath82 s denote the baryon masses of the four legs in the one - meson exchange diagram . in any case , the jlich meson propagator involves the baryon masses .",
    "replacement of these free - space masses with in - medium values would create medium effects on meson propagation which we do not wish to include in our nuclear matter calculations .",
    "the reason for keeping free - space masses in the meson propagator is twofold .",
    "first , standard dbhf calculations do not include medium effects on meson propagation as they typically use eq .",
    "( 19 ) , which does not depend on baryon masses .",
    "second , medium effects on meson propagation constitute a separate class of effects that we are not concerned with in the present context and are typically not perceived as part of the dbhf approach .",
    "having taken the steps described above , we proceed to the dbhf calculations .",
    "the effect of such corrections on the binding energy of a @xmath0 impurity in otherwise pure nuclear matter was reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we will be showing results for both the ny05 potential @xcite and the previous version of the jlich ny potential , ny94 , specifically the model referred to as @xmath83 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .  1 we show the energy per particle as a function of density for different @xmath0 concentrations as obtained from dbhf calculations along with the ny94 potential",
    "as more nucleons are replaced with @xmath0 s , generally less binding energy per particle is generated .",
    "this is due to the weaker nature of the @xmath26 interaction relative to the nn one .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 fermi momentum grows rather quickly with @xmath84 , since only two @xmath0 s can occupy each state , rather than four , which implies a fast rise of the hyperon kinetic energy .",
    "( although , for small hyperon densities , there is at first some reduction of the kinetic energy , due to the fact that @xmath0 s have larger mass and can occupy lower energy levels . )",
    "we notice that the saturation density remains essentially unchanged with increasing hyperon concentrations . as density grows , though , larger @xmath0 concentrations start to yield increased attraction .",
    "one must keep in mind that , especially at the higher densities , the nn interaction become less and less attractive due to medium effects , in particular repulsive dirac effects .",
    "thus , removing nucleons from the system can actually amount to increased binding .",
    "moving now to fig .  2 , where the ny05 potential is adopted , we see a very different scenario .",
    "we recall that the ny05 model is considerably more attractive , yielding about 50 mev for the @xmath0 binding energy @xcite whereas a value close to 30 mev was found with ny94 @xcite .",
    "naturally , we expect these differences to reflect onto the respective eos predictions . here , increasing the hyperon population yields more binding , a trend opposite to the one seen in the previous figure . again , the final balance is the result of a combination of effects .",
    "the fact that the nn component is repulsive at the higher densities , together with the more attractive nature of the ny05 potential , determines here a net increase in attraction with decreasing _ nucleon _ density .",
    "however , the additional binding becomes smaller and smaller with increasing hyperon concentration , indicating that , at sufficiently large @xmath0 densities , the net balance may turn repulsive .",
    "notice also that in fig .",
    "2 the minimum moves towards higher densities , signifying that baryon pairs favor a smaller interparticle distance .    to summarize , one must keep in mind that the energy / particle is the result of a delicate balance of both the kinetic energies and the potential energies of the two baryon species , being weighed by the respective densities .",
    "thus , although the nn interaction is generally more attractive than the n@xmath0 one , the net effect of replacing nucleons with @xmath0 s will depend sensitively on the nature of the ny interaction that s being put into the system , as well as the  stiffness \" of the original , nucleonic , eos .",
    "this is further confirmed in fig .  3 , where we show predictions from conventional bhf calculations ( i.e. , no  dirac \" effects ) .",
    "as in the previous figures , the red curve is the nucleonic eos .",
    "the solid(dashed ) curves are the predictions with ny94(ny05 ) . clearly , the effects are opposite depending on the ny interaction .",
    "qualitatively , the trend seen in each group of curves ( solid or dash ) is approximately consistent with the one observed previously in the corresponding ( i.  e. same ny potential ) dbhf predictions .",
    "however , the  cross over \" of the curves seen in fig .",
    "1 at about twice saturation density is due to a large extent to the more repulsive nature of the nucleonic eos in the dbhf calculation ( see comments above ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the effect of hyperons on the eos is strongly dependent upon the baseline ( nucleonic ) eos as well as the ny potential model . with regard to the first issue",
    ", we stress the importance of starting from a realistic eos , such as the one predicted in dbhf calculations or obtained with the inclusion of three - body forces .",
    "the second observation confirms the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the large uncertainties originating from the bare ny potentials .",
    "unfortunately , the existing data do not set sufficient constrains on the potentials , as demonstrated by the fact that different potentials can fit the available scattering data equally accurately but produce very different scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "we have reported on dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock predictions of the energy per particle in symmetric nuclear matter as a function of the total baryon density and ( moderate ) @xmath0 concentrations .",
    "dirac effects are included on both the nn and the n@xmath0 potentials .",
    "our dbhf scheme , which requires the use of relativistic momentum - space nucleon - baryon potentials , represents a fundamentally different paradigm as compared to existing calculations .",
    "ultimately , the actual fraction of hyperons present in star matter must be determined by the equations of @xmath12 stability and charge neutrality for highly asymmetric matter containing neutrons , protons , hyperons , and leptons .",
    "unlike the straightforward calculation of lepton fractions in @xmath12-stable isospin - asymmetric nucleon matter , the case of nucleons and hyperons require a lot more effort due to their strongly interacting nature .",
    "one needs to know the chemical potentials of each species ( neutrons , protons , various hyperons ) ideally at any densities and baryon concentrations .",
    "those may then have to be fit with analytic functions ( not a trivial task , given the number of dependences ) , so that they can be inserted into the appropriate equations to determine the equilibrium fractions of each baryon type .",
    "this is deferred to another paper .",
    "we observed that the predicted energy / particle is extremely sensitive to the chosen ny interaction .",
    "the large uncertainties due to the model dependence discussed in this paper are likely to impact any conclusions on the properties of strange neutron stars , which therefore must be interpreted with caution .",
    "these include considerations of deconfinement and possible transition from hadronic to quark matter , which depend sensitively on the equation of state in the hadronic phase .",
