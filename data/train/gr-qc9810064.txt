    "one of the main problems of modern cosmology is to find a satisfactory explanation to both the small  scale inhomogeneity of matter distribution and the large  scale degree of isotropy measured in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one desires to construct a general model that explains both , antagonistic , properties of our universe . in order to find such a solution ,",
    "it is interesting to investigate if homogeneous , anisotropic ( bianchi ) models can predict the level of isotropy detected by the cobe satellite and , at the same time , reproduce the local character of our universe .",
    "there have been various attempts to solve this problem ( for instance , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but inflationary cosmologies are still the most appealing since they provide explanation to some other problems , as well . accordingly ,",
    "if at its outset the universe were neither homogeneous nor isotropic , then because of a de sitter stage , it will tend to homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "inflationary models , however , still assume some fine tuned initial conditions and most of them have assumed a frw symmetry from the outset : this is the first fine  tuning one invokes in doing cosmology , since from all possible set of initial conditions , a frw universe selects a very special set of homogeneous and isotropic space  time geometries .",
    "then , by considering more general space",
    " time symmetries the question arises , whether inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic cosmological models help to understand the naturalness of inflation . in general relativity ( gr ) within anisotropic , bianchi  type models it is claimed that a positive cosmological constant provides an effective means of isotropizing homogeneous universes @xcite .",
    "the idea behind is that of the cosmic no  hair conjecture which states that in the presence of a cosmological constant the universe evolves into a de sitter space - time @xcite , at least locally @xcite . the no ",
    "hair property ensures that all inhomogeneities will be smoothed out in a region of the event horizon .",
    "the conjecture has been proved for a number of models @xcite , where it was realized that is highly related to the homogenization and isotropization of cosmological models .",
    "the initial conditions for inflation have been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the situation is that inhomogeneous , anisotropic models with negative curvature fulfills the conjecture as well , but big initial inhomogeneities lead to the formation of black holes in some regions @xcite , however in other regions inflation is possible , achieving a physical scenario in which inflating regions are surrounded by black holes @xcite ; this resembles the chaotic scenario of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "in general , it is suggested that a patch of the universe should be at some level homogeneous to consider it as a right model where inflation can take place , otherwise inflation can be prevented .",
    "accordingly , before one regards inflation one should analyze the properties of the universe , and see if some set of initial conditions will bring our universe to a sufficient smooth patch to start the inflationary expansion .",
    "this has motivated us to analyze if homogeneous , anisotropic models with a non - minimal coupling tend to loose its hairs . most of the results above apply to gr with perfect fluids minimally coupled ( for non - perfect fluids see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and for non - minimally coupled fields see refs .",
    "@xcite , where the no  hair conjecture has been proved for some scalar tensor theories , including some particular potentials and various non - minimal couplings . by trying to tacle this problem , we have shown that bianchi type models ( i , v , and ix ) in the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory @xcite tend to isotropize as time goes on @xcite .",
    "these models show an asymptotic frw behavior , but only few with an inflationary stage . however , inflation turns out to be an important , desirable feature to solve the above  mentioned problems .",
    "thus , in order to obtain an inflationary model with graceful exit , one usually introduces a potential term .",
    "therefore , in the present investigation we consider an ig theory that includes a non - minimal coupling with gravity ( _ a la _ bd ) and a potential associated with the scalar field , which in our case is identified with a higgs field . within this theory",
    "our cosmological scenario begins with an anisotropic expansion of bianchi type i , v , or ix , but only type v evolution to a frw model is consistent with imposed restrictions . in this way",
    "one achieves a sufficient smooth patch in the universe preparing the ` system ' to be able to inflate , i.e. , all physical fields present isotropize .",
    "the isotropization mechanism occurs in a similar way as in the bd theory @xcite where no potential exists .",
    "however , in the present theory the isotropization process is inflationary , whereas in the bd theory it is not necessarily the case , see ref .",
    "the effective equivalence of both theories is possible because , during the time of isotropization , the potential term in the ig theory will not contribute significantly as a stress energy to the dynamical equations , in our scenario ] .",
    "afterwards , because of the higgs potential of the theory , during the ssb of the higgs field , a second inflationary era follows . finally , after inflation a frw behavior is dominant .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ igbdgr ] we present the ig theory , pointing out some differences among it , bd , and gr theories . in section [ anibh ]",
    "the cosmological field equations are analyzed in view of the isotropization of the solutions , employing some results for the bd theory that turn out to be valid for this theory , as well . in section [ physce ]",
    "we present the above - mentioned physical scenario .",
    "finally , the conclusions are written in section [ coniso ] .",
    "we have investigated two viable ig models of inflation , one using the su(5 ) higgs field @xcite and , the other , the su(2 ) higgs @xcite , both coupled non  minimally to gravity .",
    "the lagrangian for both theories has the same mathematical form , and therefore , the qualitative behavior of the cosmological models are very similar . in the present work , we consider the specific physical scenario using the su(5 ) higgs field  gravity theory , fully discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , however most of the conclusions are valid also for the su(2 ) higgs field  gravity model .",

    "gev@xmath14 . however , in cosmology fitting the dynamics of cluster of galaxies suggests ( in gr ) that @xmath15 @xcite , that is , @xmath16 gev@xmath14 ; this is the heart of the cosmological constant problem . ] because of the presence of mass terms in eq .",

    "@xcite ; this is important to mention because there are a number of results using conformal transformations among different theories demanding the same physics , but in our case such transformations are not conformally invariant .",

    "if there were any yukawa couplings , this equation would not be equal to zero ( this is actually the case for the standard model of particle physics , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , ig and bd theories are equal except for the potential and the meaning of covariant derivatives .",
    "this can be seen by identifying @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the bd field . indeed , bd and ig theories are related .",
    "the idea to induce gravity by a higgs field has been already discussed elsewhere @xcite , and the motivation for us is that the field coupled to the matter content of the universe , _ a la _ brans and dicke @xcite , is the same that produces their masses , i.e. , a higgs field .",
    "then , the identification of both scalar fields is very appealing , see refs .",
    "though this identification is quite simple , the resulting ig theory presented above is more elaborated than the bd theory .",
    "accordingly , in the ig theory the @xmath19field is a higgs field with its associated potential .",
    "then , a matter content appears explicitly with its corresponding energy scales .",
    "in fact , there are three energy scales to deal with : the planck , the higgs , and the @xmath29 boson masses .",
    "the higgs mass energy is given through eq .",
    "( [ eqh ] ) [ see also eq .",
    "( [ hig ] ) below ] , @xmath30 , and it determines the dynamical behavior of the @xmath19field once the ssb begins to occur .",
    "a second energy scale is given by the @xmath29 ( the same as the @xmath31 ) boson mass , @xmath32 gev .",
    "finally , the planck energy scale is given through @xmath33 .",
    "after the ssb @xmath34 implying that the coupling constant must be @xmath35 , which is very small because one is forcing to match two energies scales given by the planck and boson masses through the non - minimal coupling in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .",
    "in contrast to what happens in the ig theory , in the bd theory there is no potential nor is gr induced after a ssb process .",
    "therefore , the @xmath36field in bd should be nowadays a cosmic , scalar function , and to fit well the theory with the experimental data the coupling constant must have a great value @xcite , @xmath37 , making bd and gr theories very similar .    in section [ physce ] , we will present a cosmological scenario in the ig theory , yet employing some results found for the bd theory which turn out to be also valid for the ig theory . as pointed out above",
    ", both theories have the same mathematical form when the potential term plays no significant role in the field equations .",
    "therefore , in order to translate analytic bd results to the ig theory and to clarify when this situation is correct , we put the above equations in terms of the bd field @xmath27 , which in our case represents the excited higgs field .",

    "( [ lag ] ) ] .    the continuity equation ( energy  momentum conservation law ) reads @xmath44 and in the present particle physics theory , @xmath5 gut , all the fermions remain massless after the first symmetry  breaking and no baryonic matter is originated in this way .",
    "this is the reason to have eq .",
    "( [ eqh ] ) equal to zero , too .    the source term in eq .",
    "( [ hig ] ) is important for reheating , since the higgs field remains coupled to @xmath40 , i.e. , to gauge boson fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite is claimed that there are no couplings between the higgs field and other fermionic or bosonic fields , but in our induced gravity approach there indeed exist bosonic field s couplings .",

    "( [ hig ] ) vanishes , and if the second term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ eqtt ] ) vanishes , as well .",

    "we study in the following only the anisotropic character of the solutions , and not the influence of the potential of the theory .",
    "otherwise , the potential term will automatically produce an inflationary stage from its outset ( see footnote [ f2 ] ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and what we desire is to have a model in which inflation takes place only after the isotropization process has almost concluded , up to some extent at least . this would guarantee that anisotropic stresses decrease with time , as it is the case in gr @xcite .",
    "we want to investigate the dynamics before inflation occurs to see if the model dynamically tends to a frw model . if this were the case , any physical perturbation ( hairs )",
    "present will experience an isotropization mechanism resulting in the smoothing of any patch of the universe .",

    ", the universe dynamics governed by the @xmath36field will isotropize all these extra fields .",
    "thus , thinking in a chaotic scenario where the initial conditions for inflation imply that the region , and the inflaton field itself , should be sufficiently homogeneous and isotropic , then , after such an isotropization process it is more likely that inflation takes place successfully . therefore , an isotropization mechanism can be important in pre - inflationary dynamics .",
    "inflation is a nice feature to solve the problems of standard model of cosmology , but most realistic models of inflation @xcite are fine tuned .",
    "for instance , a fact that is usually omitted is that to achieve enough @xmath67foldings of expansion new inflationary models demand the initial inflaton field ( say , @xmath68 ) to have very small values , about @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the true vacuum value of the @xmath71field .",
    "this fact can be understood with the help of the slow rollover conditions : @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which in turn imply , respectively , that @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ". typically , gut theories have @xmath76gev , then the second condition implies very small initial values for @xmath68 , whereas the first condition is a severe impediment ( or inconsistency with realistic particle physics ) to have enough @xmath67foldings of expansion , and hence , to solve the horizon and flatness problems of cosmology .",
    "another fine  tunning aspect or , to say precisely , inconsistency relies on the fact that @xmath77 [ @xmath78 coming from a potential similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqph ] ) ] to fit well the temperature fluctuations measured by the cobe satellite @xcite .",
    "yet from particle physics one expects that @xmath79 ( in any case not that small as required above ! ) .",
    "further , such smallness of @xmath78 works in opposite sense as for producing a high reheating temperature ( @xmath80 ) after inflation , since typically @xmath81 .",
    "then , the baryon asymmetry could not be attained , unless very fine tuning initial conditions are chosen .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate models that achieve a successful inflationary stage when they do not start with standard , inflationary initial conditions .",
    "accordingly , our motivation is to study cosmological scenarios in scalar tensor theories with a particle physics content , and to consider more general initial conditions to understand some of the ac doc assumptions or problems of inflationary cosmologies .",
    "an important issue is naturally the study of cosmological isotropization processes .",

    "if @xmath1 were not that small , a power law solution ( @xmath161 ) would be valid . ] .",
    "it is curious that we initially aimed to have a model avoiding to begin with inflationary initial conditions , and because of the smallness of @xmath1 we got an even stronger ( than de sitter ) inflationary era caused by the higgs field itself ( kinetic + non  minimal coupling ) , but not by the potential of the theory . in this way , during this time the universe begins to loose its _ anisotropic _ hairs because the strong exponential expansion dilutes any perturbation present in a distance smaller than its event horizon and the no  hair conjecture is then dynamically fulfilled .    in gr the presence of a kinetic term associated to a field",

    "@xcite . here",
    ", we have the same behavior for @xmath28 , but this solution induces an exponential universe , regardless of the potential . in this case , one does not have a slow rollover dynamics , but the solution itself includes an exponential expansion with exit ( no graceful exit problem ) in a natural , evolutionary way tending to an effective frw model .",
    "the reason for this is that after some elapsed time the variable @xmath124 will be no more effectively a constant and the quadratic term in @xmath121 will dominate and , therefore , the solution behaves as shown in figure [ b5iii ] , that is , with @xmath163 for @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ phi ] shows the evolution of the physical higgs field .",
    "afterwards , at @xmath164 inflation due to the potential takes place .",
    "the initial conditions are such that when inflation is to start , the system is already almost isotropic .",
    "then , inflation ( due to the potential ) begins after the model is to some degree an open frw model .",
    "the dynamics of this stage is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figures [ b5i ] , [ b5ii ] , [ b5iii ] , and [ phi ] describe the dynamics dominated by perfect fluid+kinetic terms in early stages , precisely when the potential stress energy does not play a significant role in the evolution .",
    "but after some elapsed time ( at @xmath88 ) the potential enters into the ` game ' , because the density diminishes rapidly as @xmath165 with @xmath166 for radiation and @xmath167 for dust like matter ( boson fields ) , whereas the potential is only slowly variating .",
    "thus , from the different energy stresses in eqs .",
    "( [ a123 ] , [ h123 ] , [ psi ] ) the one which diminishes slower , as time elapses , is the potential term , in such a way that it will eventually be the major stress energy contribution to the dynamical equations .",
    "the potential dominance begins , see footnote [ f5 ] ) , see refs . @xcite . ] at the @xmath88 time such that @xmath168 in order to guarantee some degree of isotropization of physical processes present before inflation takes place .",
    "therefore , if any perturbation ( _ hairs _ ) is to be present before that time it must have experienced some degree of isotropization , the same as the scale factors .",
    "after inflation when the higgs field approaches its symmetry breaking value , @xmath169 , the potential diminishes , and begins the high oscillation period of the higgs field described by eq .",
    "( [ hig ] or [ psi ] ) .",
    "the higgs oscillations act on the scale factors dynamics with a characteristic frequency given by @xmath170 that we have taken equal to @xmath171 gev .",
    "this high oscillation period induces a frw model ( @xmath172 ) @xcite , as it can be observed in figure [ b5iiii ] .",
    "then , inflation , caused by the potential , acts as a transient attractor , then , graceful exiting .",
    "this result confirms the general theorems proved in refs .",
    "@xcite about the no  hair conjecture in scalar tensor theories .",
    "naturally , one can not expect this solution to be ever trapped in the de sitter attractor , since the higgs field evolves to its ssb minimum , which is the state of lowest energy .",
    "then , the no  hair conjecture fails during the high oscillation period of the higgs field , as one expects .",
    "( 6,5)(0,1 )    during inflation ( due to the potential ) perturbations of the higgs field exit the hubble horizon ( @xmath173 ) , and they will later re  enter to form the seeds of galaxy formation with a magnitude@xcite : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the time when the fluctuations of the scalar field leave @xmath173 during inflation and @xmath176 is the number of e - folds of inflation at that time .",
    "the gravitational wave ( @xmath177 ) perturbations considered normally should also be small @xcite , @xmath178 which also lies within the experimental limits .",
    "the spectral index of the scalar perturbations , @xmath179 , serves as a test for models of the very early universe , independently of the magnitude of the perturbations .",
    "it can be calculated using the slow roll approximation up to second order @xcite . for @xmath0 , however , one can just take the first order to be sufficiently accurate @xcite : @xmath180 for @xmath181 , it implies @xmath182 in accordance with the recent cobe dmr results @xcite .",
    "* bianchi ix *    for the bianchi ix model the constants @xmath183 explicit values are unknown , except for the value of @xmath112 of the isotropic model .",
    "to be physical this solution needs to have @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect to find isotropizing solutions only for @xmath185 , but our ig gravity requires @xmath186 and the scenario is untenable .",
    "within an ig theory we have analyzed bianchi i , v , and ix models .",
    "only the bianchi type v may isotropize by means of the non  minimal coupling of the theory , because the value of @xmath187 is crucial for its isotropization .",
    "these results , extracted from the analytic solutions in the bd theory @xcite , are here applied to the ig theory in an epoch when the potential stress energy is not significant for the evolution , that is , when both theories are mathematically equivalent .",
    "if this situation would have happened , initial anisotropies were washed out in a universe with bianchi v type initial conditions . on the other side ,",
    "if the potential dominates from the very beginning , inflation ( because of the potential ) occurs directly and it induces the same effect , as expected .    the isotropization mechanism in type v can be inflationary even before the potential plays a role or , otherwise , of the @xmath163 type .",
    "in the former case , from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , the models experience a strong period of exponential expansion , while the higgs field evolves as @xmath188 , achieving the isotropization of any hairs present ( also possibly due to some other fields ) .",
    "after the isotropization mechanism has been concluded , because of eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) , the solution turns away from an exponential behavior to become effectively a frw model , where @xmath189 for @xmath51 .",
    "afterwards , with the universe `` almost '' isotropic the potential begins to dominate the dynamical equations , and therefore inflation due to the potential occurs .",
    "later on , as the higgs field approaches its ground state value ( @xmath190 ) , inflation ends and an effective frw dynamics is dominant . thus , our scenario possesses two inflationary transient attractors , one produced by the non - minimal coupling , and the other by the higgs potential .",
    "the tests of inflation for this theory have been proved to be within the experimental limits in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we looked up for the conditions under which isotropization before inflation occurs in a theory , where the value of @xmath1 is strictly determined to be @xmath191 .",
    "otherwise , for arbitary @xmath1values , the mechanism of isotropization can also develop before inflation . here the bianchi model i tends to the flat frw solution , the bianchi model v to the open frw solution , and the bianchi model ix to the closed frw solution .",
