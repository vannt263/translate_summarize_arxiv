    "in @xcite we studied the problem of complete controllability of finite - level quantum systems with nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "we showed that many quantum systems of physical interest are indeed completely controllable but that there are nevertheless systems with certain symmetries that are not completely controllable .",
    "this paper is devoted to identifying the dynamical lie algebras for the latter systems .    as in the previous paper",
    ", we consider the case of a driven quantum system , for which the interaction with the control field is linear , i.e. , we assume that the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the internal system hamiltonian and @xmath8 represents the interaction of the system with the real control field @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hermitian . for a finite - level quantum system",
    "there always exists a complete orthonormal set of energy eigenstates @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and thus the internal hamiltonian can be expanded in terms of the energy eigenfunctions @xmath10 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an @xmath14 matrix with elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy levels of the system .",
    "the @xmath16 are real since @xmath7 is hermitian .",
    "we shall assume that the energy levels are ordered in a non - decreasing sequence , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the frequencies for transitions @xmath18 are non - negative @xmath19 in the following it will be convenient to deal with trace - zero operators . thus , if @xmath7 has non - zero trace then we define the trace - zero operator @xmath20 i_n,\\ ] ] which is equivalent to @xmath7 up to addition of a constant multiple of the identity matrix @xmath21 . expanding the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 with respect to the complete set of orthonormal energy eigenstates @xmath10 leads to @xmath22 where the transition dipole moments @xmath23 , which we assume real , satisfy @xmath24 . in this paper",
    "we shall only be concerned with quantum systems for which the interaction with the control field is determined by transitions between adjacent energy levels , as is typical in the dipole approximation .",
    "it will also be assumed that there are no ` self - interactions ' , i.e. , that the diagonal elements @xmath25 are zero for all @xmath26 . thus , letting @xmath27 for @xmath28 we have @xmath29",
    "the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 generate a lie algebra @xmath32 called the dynamical lie algebra of the control system .",
    "this lie algebra is important since it determines the lie group @xmath33 on which the control system evolves @xcite .",
    "precisely speaking , the trajectories of the system subject to any control field are confined to the exponential image of the lie algebra @xmath32 .",
    "knowledge of the dynamical lie algebra thus enables us to determine the degree of controllability of a quantum system @xcite , to identify reachable or non - reachable target states @xcite , and to determine whether a kinematical bound for an observable is dynamically accessible @xcite .",
    "the dynamical lie algebra @xmath32 generated by the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 defined in ( [ eq : hzero ] ) and ( [ eq : hone ] ) is a real lie algebra of @xmath14 skew - hermitian matrices , and the related lie algebra @xmath34 generated by @xmath35 and @xmath31 is a real lie algebra of traceless , skew - hermitian matrices .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is always a subalgebra of @xmath36 . since @xmath32 is isomorphic to @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 if @xmath40 , it suffices to determine @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from classical results that a pair of skew - hermitian matrices in @xmath36 almost always generates the full lie algebra @xmath36 ( see lemma 4 in @xcite , for example ) . for the type of quantum systems considered in this paper , explicit criteria ensuring @xmath41",

    "if @xmath54 then @xmath55 for some @xmath56 is required as well .    as has been shown in @xcite , many quantum systems of physical interest indeed satisfy these criteria .",
    "however , there are systems of physical interest that do not meet these criteria . for instance , if any of the dipole moments @xmath57 vanish then the system decomposes into independent subsystems and its dynamical lie algebra @xmath34 is a sum of subalgebras of @xmath36 @xcite . but",
    "even if all the @xmath57 are non - zero , the dynamical lie algebra of the system may be a proper subalgebra of @xmath36 , for example , if the transition frequencies @xmath58 and the transition dipole moments @xmath57 satisfy @xmath59 as is the case for a system with @xmath0 equally spaced energy levels and uniform dipole moments . in the following",
    "we show that the dynamical lie algebra @xmath34 of such a system is a subalgebra of @xmath5 if @xmath2 , and a subalgebra of @xmath3 if @xmath60 , and give criteria ensuring @xmath61 or @xmath62 , respectively . in [ app : d ] , we also briefly discuss why the lie algebra @xmath63 does not arise for the systems considered in this paper .",
