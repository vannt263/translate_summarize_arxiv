    "the discovery of an unexpected diminution in the observed energy fluxes coming from type ia supernovae @xcite has opened one of the most puzzling and deepest problems in cosmology today .",
    "these observations have been interpreted as solid evidence for an accelerating universe dominated by something called dark energy . although the cosmological constant seems to be the simplest explanation for the phenomenon ,",
    "several dynamical scenarios have been tried out since 1998 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . while some authors sustain the idea of the existence of a dark energy , others propose modifications of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian known as @xmath0 ( @xcite or @xcite for recent reviews ) as a way to obtain a late accelerating expansion .",
    "a great difficulty these theories have , from the point of view of the metric formalism , is that the resulting field equations are 4th order equations , which in many cases makes these hard to analyze . besides",
    ", the simplest cases of the kind @xmath1 have shown difficulties with , weak field tests chiba , olmo , gravitational instabilities @xcite and do not present a matter dominated era previous to the acceleration era @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the palatini variational approach for such @xmath0 theories leads to 2nd order field equations , and some authors have achieved to put observational constraints to these theories @xcite .",
    "however in many cases the equations are still hard to work with , as evidenced by the functional form of the modified friedmann equation for a generic @xmath0 .",
    "recently , models based on modified teleparallel gravity were presented as an alternative to inflationary models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show a cosmological solution for the acceleration of the universe by means of a sort of theories of modified gravity , namely @xmath2 , based on a modification of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) lagrangian @xcite where the torsion will be the responsible of the observed acceleration of the universe , and the field equations will always be 2nd order equations .",
    "teleparallelism @xcite uses as dynamical object a vierbein field @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point @xmath5 of the manifold : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "each vector @xmath8 can be described by its components @xmath9 , @xmath10 in a coordinate basis ; i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "notice that latin indexes refer to the tangent space , while greek indexes label coordinates on the manifold .",
    "the metric tensor is obtained from the dual vierbein as @xmath12 .",
    "differing from general relativity , which uses the torsionless levi - civita connection , teleparallelism uses the curvatureless weitzenbck connection @xcite , whose non - null torsion is @xmath13 this tensor encompasses all the information about the gravitational field .",
    "the tegr lagrangian is built with the torsion ( [ torsion2 ] ) , and its dynamical equations for the vierbein imply the einstein equations for the metric .",
    "the teleparallel lagrangian is @xcite , @xmath14 where : @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the contorsion tensor : @xmath17 which equals the difference between weitzenbck and levi - civita connections .    in this work",
    "the gravitational field will be driven by a lagrangian density that is a function of @xmath18 .",
    "thus the action reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the case @xmath21 corresponds to tegr .",
    "if matter couples to the metric in the standard form then the variation of the action with respect to the vierbein leads to the equations @xmath22 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the fact that equations ( [ ecsmovim ] ) are 2nd order makes them simpler than the dynamical equations resulting in @xmath0 theories .",
    "we will assume a flat homogeneous and isotropic frw universe , so @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cosmological scale factor . by replacing in ( torsion2 ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ k ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath27 @xmath28 being the hubble parameter @xmath29 . as a remarkable feature , the scale factor enters the invariant @xmath18 just through the hubble parameter .",
    "the substitution of the vierbein ( [ tetradasfrw ] ) in ( ecsmovim ) for @xmath30 yields @xmath31 besides , the equation @xmath32 is @xmath33-f(l_t)=16\\pi g\\:p\\ ] ] in eqs .",
    "( [ frwmod]-[ec1 - 1 ] ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the total density and pressure respectively .",
    "it can be easily derived that they accomplish the conservation equation @xmath36 whatever @xmath2 is .",
    "thus , if the state equation is @xmath37 then @xmath38 evolves as @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the cosmological redshift ) .",
    "we are interested in obtaining an accelerated expansion without dark energy but driven by torsion . for this we will try with a kind of @xmath41 theories : @xmath42being @xmath43 and @xmath44 real constants to be determined by observational constraints .",
    "although the functional form of ( [ ft ] ) is similar to those considered in @xmath0 literature , now the guideline towards modified gravity is @xmath28 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "this fact gives to these theories another interesting feature because @xmath28 is the most important cosmological variable .",
    "for later times the term @xmath46 is dominant , while in early times , when @xmath47 , general relativity is recovered . from ( [ frwmod ] ) along with ( [ ft ] ) , the modified friedmann equation results to be @xmath48(a functional dependence similar to the results other authors arrived , through different theoretical motivations such as @xcite ) .",
    "now , replacing @xmath49 , and calling @xmath50 the contributions of matter and radiation to the total energy density today , eq .",
    "( [ friedmodif ] ) becomes @xmath51where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the evaluation of this equation for @xmath55 allows to rephrase the constant @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath44 : @xmath58 . for @xmath59 ( then @xmath60 ) the gr spatially flat friedmann equation @xmath61 is retrieved",
    "the case @xmath62 recovers the gr dynamics with cosmological constant @xmath63 .",
    "notice the functional simplicity of ( [ friedmodif ] ) compared with its analogue in @xmath0 theories .",
    "compared with gr , @xmath44 is the sole new free parameter in ( [ friedmodif2 ] ) , since specifying the value of @xmath44 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) the value of @xmath66 ( in units of @xmath67 ) is automatically fixed through the relation ( [ friedmodif ] ) . in order to obtain @xmath68",
    "we solve numerically the equation ( [ friedmodif2 ] ) .    since the most solid evidence for the acceleration of the universe comes from measurements of luminosity distances for type ia supernovae , we will use the most recent compilation of 307 sne ia events ( the _ union _ sample ) @xcite , to put constraints in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "the predicted distance modulus for a supernova at redshift @xmath40 , for a given set of parameters * * p**=(@xmath44 , @xmath64 ) , is @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the apparent and absolute magnitudes respectively , and @xmath73 stands for the luminosity distance ( in units of megaparsecs ) , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is given by the numerical solution of ( [ friedmodif2 ] ) .",

    "we have considered a radiation component @xmath65=5 x @xmath87 .",
    "the cmb shift parameter is given by @xcite , @xmath88 we can use both parameters since our model presents matter domination at the decoupling time .",

    "an interesting point to be highlighted is that equation ( [ friedmodif ] ) reveals that a value of @xmath112 , as the one obtained by considering only snia data , implies that the effective dark torsion is of the phantom type @xcite .",
