    "given a discrete structure on a set of elements , a natural question is to be able to locate efficiently the elements using the structure .",
    "if the elements are the vertices of a graph , one can use the neighbourhoods of the elements to locate them . in this context ,",
    "karpovsky , chakrabarty and levitin  @xcite have introduced the notion of identifying codes in 1998 .",
    "an identifying code of a graph is a dominating set having the property that any two vertices of the graph have distinct neighbourhoods within the identifying code .",
    "hence any vertex of the graph is specified by its neighbourhood in the identifying code .",
    "initially , identifying codes have been introduced to model fault - diagnosis in multiprocessor systems but later other applications were discovered such as the design of emergency sensor networks in facilities  @xcite .",
    "they are related to other concepts in graphs like locating - dominating sets  @xcite and resolving sets  @xcite .",
    "the problem of computing an identifying code of minimal size is np - complete in general  @xcite but can be naturally expressed as an integer linear problem .",
    "also , one can ask how good the fractional relaxation of this problem can be .",
    "we focus on vertex - transitive graphs since for these graphs , we are able to compute the optimal size of a fractional identifying code .",
    "this value depends only on three parameters of the graph : the number and degree of vertices and the smallest size of the symmetric difference of two distinct closed neighbourhoods .",
    "moreover , the optimal cardinality of an integer identifying code is at most at a logarithmic factor ( in the number of vertices @xmath4 ) of the fractional optimal value .    identifying codes",
    "have already been studied in different classes of vertex - transitive graphs , especially in cycles  @xcite and hypercubes  @xcite . in these examples , the order of the size of an optimal identifying code seems to always match its fractional value .",
    "however , the smallest size of symmetric differences of closed neighbourhoods is small compared to the number of vertices : either it is constant ( for cycles ) or it has logarithmic order in the number of vertices ( for hypercubes ) .",
    "therefore we focus in this paper on vertex - transitive strongly regular graphs that are vertex - transitive graphs with the property that two adjacent ( respectively non - adjacent ) vertices always have the same number of common neighbours . in particular , the size of symmetric differences can only take two values and is of order at least @xmath5 if the graph is not a trivial strongly regular graph .",
    "another interest of considering identifying codes in strongly regular graphs is that they are strongly related to resolving sets .",
    "a resolving set is a set @xmath6 of vertices such that each vertex is uniquely specified by its distances to @xmath6 .",
    "the minimum size of a resolving set is called the metric dimension of the graph . if a graph has diameter @xmath7  as is the case for non - trivial strongly regular graphs  then a resolving set is the same as an identifying code except that the vertices of the resolving set are not identified .",
    "a consequence is that the optimal size of identifying codes and the metric dimension have the same order in strongly regular graphs .",
    "actually , babai  @xcite introduced a notion equivalent to resolving sets in order to improve the complexity of the isomorphism problem for strongly regular graphs .",
    "he established an upper bound of order @xmath8 on the metric dimension of strongly regular graphs  @xcite .",
    "he also gave a finer bound using the degree @xmath9 of vertices of order @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "thanks to this last bound , any family of strongly regular graphs for which @xmath4 is linear with @xmath9 have logarithmic metric dimension .",
    "this is for example the case of paley graphs that have also been studied by fijav and mohar  @xcite who gave a finer bound .",
    "bailey and cameron  @xcite proved that the metric dimension of some kneser and johnson graphs has order @xmath5 .",
    "values for small strongly regular graphs have been computed  @xcite .",
    "recently , bailey  @xcite used resolving sets in strongly regular graphs to compute the metric dimension of some distance - regular graphs .",
    "paley graphs give an example of an infinite family of graphs for which the optimal value of fractional identifying code is constant but the integer value is logarithmic , and so the gap between the two is also logarithmic .",
    "we consider another family of strongly regular graphs that have never been studied in the context of identifying codes nor resolving sets : the adjacency graphs of generalized quadrangles .",
    "these graphs are constructed using finite geometries .",
    "constructing identifying codes can be seen as a way to break the inherent symmetry of these graphs .",
    "we give constructions of identifying codes with size of optimal order .",
    "this order is of the form @xmath2 with @xmath11 and corresponds to the order of the fractional value .",
    "* outline . * in section  [ sec : bas ] , we give formal definitions and classic results useful for the rest of the paper . in section  [ sec : frac ] , we exhibit the linear program for identifying codes , compute the optimal value of the relaxation for vertex - transitive graphs and deduce a general bound . in section  [ sec : previous ] , we review known results for identifying codes in vertex - transitive graphs and compare them to our general bound . finally in section  [ sec : srg ] , we study strongly regular graphs and in particular adjacency graphs of generalized quadrangles .",
