    "open books have gained a prominent role in contact geometry and low dimensional topology ever since giroux established a striking correspondence between contact structures and open books on @xmath0manifolds @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to deduce contact geometric information from coarse topological invariants of supporting open books .",
    "the minimal genus for a supporting open book , called the _ support genus _ of a contact @xmath0manifold @xmath3 @xcite , is such an invariant .",
    "thanks to works of etnyre , wendl , and several others , quite a lot is now known about contact with support genus zero , as well as their symplectic and stein fillings ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is known that not all contact structures can be supported by planar open books @xcite",
    ". however , 15 years after giroux , it is still an open question whether there are contact structures which can not be supported by genus@xmath1 open books .",
    "naturally , one would like to see if there are any distinguishing properties for contact @xmath0manifolds that can be supported by genus@xmath1 open books , perhaps similar to those known to hold for planar ones .",
    "there are a few intimately related aspects we will consider in this note : to date , there are no known examples of planar open books ( resp .",
    "planar contact structures ) that can be filled by infinitely many allowable lefschetz fibrations ( resp .",
    "stein surfaces ) , whereas there are many examples of higher @xmath4 open books with such fillings ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "no genus@xmath5 or genus@xmath1 open book can be filled by allowable lefschetz fibrations with _ arbitrarily large _",
    "euler characteristic ( see , for example , @xcite ) , whereas many examples have been found in recent years again for @xmath4 open books @xcite .",
    "notably , the euler characteristic of fillings of a contact @xmath0manifold with support genus zero is also bounded @xcite , but this property is not known to extend to support genus one .",
    "( if it did , this would provide an obstruction for contact @xmath0manifolds with arbitrarily large sten fillings to admit genus@xmath1 open books . ) in this note , we will explore each of these types of fillings .",
    "we prove the following :    there are ( infinitely many ) contact @xmath0manifolds with support genus one , each one of which admits infinitely many homotopy inequivalent stein fillings , but do not admit arbitrarily large ones .",
    "these are all supported by genus@xmath1 open books , each bounding infinitely many distinct genus@xmath1 allowable lefschetz fibrations on their stein fillings with infinitely many distinct homology groups .",
    "many earlier examples of contact @xmath0manifolds with infinitely many stein fillings ( e.g. @xcite ) have used higher genera open books , which also admit arbitrarily large stein fillings by @xcite .",
    "examples of contact @xmath0manifolds with support genus one and admitting infinitely many stein fillings were given by yasui in @xcite , where logarithmic transforms were used to produce exotic fillings ( see remark  [ yasuiexotic ] ) .",
    "our theorem provides the first examples which illustrate that the two classes of contact @xmath0manifolds are different .",
    "in the course of proving the above theorem , we will observe that fillings of any given planar contact @xmath0manifold not only have restricted euler characteristics , but also they can have only finitely many _",
    "homology groups _",
    "( proposition  [ planarfillings ] ) .",
    "in contrast , we will produce infinitely many factorizations of genus@xmath1 mapping classes into only _",
    "four _ positive dehn twists , which induce homologically distinct allowable lefschetz fibrations ( lemma  [ keyexample ] ) .",
    "two ingredients in this simple construction are suitable _ partial conjugations _ which effectively change the homology ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the explicit monodromy of a genus@xmath1 open book with three binding components supporting the standard stein fillable contact structure on @xmath6 ( lemma  [ keyrelation ] and proposition  [ 3torusob ] ; also @xcite ) . the small topology of these fillings will then allow us to show that many of these contact @xmath0manifolds admit _ symplectic calabi - yau caps _ introduced in @xcite , so as to conclude that they can _ not _ admit arbitrarily large stein fillings ( theorem  [ mainthm1 ] ) .",
    "we moreover observe that there are contact @xmath0manifolds supported by planar _ spinal open books _ @xcite which also admit infinitely many stein fillings , but do not admit arbitrarily large ones ( remark  [ spinal ] ) .    the second part of our article concerns fillings of _ quasipositive links _ , which are closures of quasipositive braids . by the pioneering works of rudolph @xcite and boileau and orevkov @xcite ,",
    "these links are characterized as oriented boundaries of smooth pieces of complex analytic curves in the unit @xmath2ball which can be realized as _ braided surfaces_. an intimate connection between fillings of contact @xmath0manifolds and quasipositive braids is provided by loi and piergallini @xcite , who showed that every stein filling of a contact @xmath0manifold is a branched cover of the stein @xmath2ball along a braided surface .",
    "we will provide infinitely many complex curves in the @xmath2ball filling the same transverse links in the boundary @xmath0sphere :    there are ( infinitely many ) elements in the @xmath2strand braid group , each of which admits infinitely many quasipositive braid factorizations up to hurwitz equivalence .",
    "a particular family gives infinitely many complex analytic annuli in the @xmath2ball with different fundamental group complements , all filling the same transverse link .",
    "we will derive these examples from a refined construction of positive factorizations of elements in the mapping class group of a torus with two boundary components .",
    "these factorizations will commute with the hyperelliptic involution exchanging the two boundary circles , so they descend to quasipositive factorizations of certain ( theorem  [ mainthm2 ] ) . in turn , the quasipositive factorizations prescribe braided surfaces , which by the work of rudolph , can be made complex analytic .",
    "the frugality of our factorizations makes it possible to strike remarkably small topology among these examples , such as complex _",
    "annuli _ filling in the same @xmath7component transverse link .",
    "the _ infinite _ families we obtain in this paper drastically improve the existing literature on fillings of genus@xmath1 open books and @xmath2braids .",
    "our examples demonstrate that for each @xmath8 , there are elements in the mapping class group of a torus with @xmath9 boundary components which admit infinitely many distinct factorizations into positive dehn twists , distinguished by their homologies . for @xmath10 , examples admitting a few distinct factorizations were obtained by auroux in @xcite using calculations in @xmath11 , whereas examples of quasipositive factorizations of some @xmath0 and @xmath2braids yielding _ two _ distinct braided surfaces were obtained in @xcite ( see remarks  [ aurouxfact ] and  [ gengfact ] ) .",
    "moreover , recent work of orevkov @xcite shows that any @xmath0braid admits at most finitely many quasipositive factorizations up to hurwitz equivalence , and the same goes for positive factorizations of a mapping class on a torus with one boundary @xcite .",
    "hence our examples of infinite families of fillings are optimal in terms of the number of boundary components for genus@xmath1 mapping classes and the number of strands for braids .",

    "it is now a kirby calculus exercise , which we will leave the details of to the reader . sliding two of the @xmath105framed @xmath7handles over the third one we obtain two pairs of canceling @xmath1 and @xmath7handle pairs we can remove .",
    "the resulting diagram is easily seen to be the standard diagram for @xmath106 with two @xmath1handles and one @xmath7handle , whose boundary is @xmath6 . or instead",
    ", one can obtain a surgery diagram for the boundary after trading the @xmath1handles with @xmath5framed unknots in the first picture , and perform the similar link calculus to arrive at the surgery diagram for @xmath6 given on the right hand side of figure  2 .",

    "[ elliptic ] the star relation prescribes a genus@xmath1 elliptic fibration with three @xcite .",

    "this shows that @xmath117 has a finite number of possibilities .",
    "further , the collection of curves @xmath78 in @xmath22 gives a presentation of @xmath118 with @xmath15 generators and @xmath114 relations , each of the type @xmath119 each relator is given by writing the homology class of the curve @xmath24 in the presentation @xmath22 in the basis @xmath120 , where @xmath108 is the corresponding homology generator in @xmath118 for each boundary component @xmath89 , and more importantly where @xmath121 .",
    "therefore there are only finitely many possible relations in a presentation of @xmath118 for a stein filling @xmath58 of @xmath41 .",
    "the remainder of the proposition follows from work of wendl @xcite and niederkrger - wendl @xcite equating minimal strong symplectic fillings with positive factorizations for planar contact manifolds .",
