    "over the last 15 years there has been tremendous progress in controlling atomic gaseous quantum matter at ultralow temperatures in laboratory experiments . at the same time",
    "there have been spectacular advances in the theoretical understanding of ultracold matter .",
    "for example , quantum degenerate atomic samples have been loaded into optical lattice potentials , allowing the realization of strongly - correlated many - body systems and enabling the direct observation of quantum phase transitions with essentially full control over the parameter space [ 14 ] . also , quantum gas mixtures have been at the focus of experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "for example , fermionic spin mixtures have enabled ground - breaking experiments on the bec - bcs crossover ( for an overview , see ref .",
    "bose - bose and fermi - bose quantum gas mixtures have recently attracted further widespread attention as a starting point for efficient creation of high phase - space density samples of weakly - bound molecules @xcite created on feshbach resonances and , after molecular state transfer , the creation of ultracold and dense samples of deeply bound ground - state molecules [ 911 ] .",
    "such molecular samples promise myriad possibilities for new directions of research in fields such as ultracold chemistry , quantum information science , precision metrology , bose - einstein condensation , and quantum many - body physics [ 1217 ] ( for recent overview articles on the status of the field and on possible experiments , see refs .",

    "ultracold samples of homonuclear molecules such as cs@xmath0 would allow novel studies of few - body collisional physics [ 2428 ] , would enable bose - einstein condensation of ground state molecules @xcite , and would open up new terrain for high resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "heteronuclear molecules such as krb and rbcs , with sizable permanent electric dipole moments of the order of 1 debye in their rovibronic ground state @xcite , feature long - range and anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "therefore , ultracold samples of polar molecules open up completely new avenues for research . for example , at ultralow temperatures , scattering and reaction dynamics are expected to be dominated by dipolar effects [ 28 , 3339 ] .",
    "in fact , recent experiments on krb have reached this regime @xcite .",

    "the molecular population is rotated to the final molecular level via a dark state which has no contribution from lossy electronically excited levels .",
    "stirap is effected by a sequence of overlapping laser pulses , which adiabatically changes the character of the dark state from the initially populated molecular level to the target level . to satisfy adiabaticity , the product of the stirap transfer time and the rabi frequencies for the stirap transitions needs to be sufficiently high . for transfer from the extremely weakly bound molecular levels , populated by feshbach association , to the rovibronic ground state",

    "when compared to heteronuclear molecules , homonuclear molecules , such as cs@xmath0 , feature an additional symmetry with respect to exchange of the identical nuclei , the so - called @xmath29 @xmath30 symmetry , which imposes additional selection rules for optical transitions and hence restricts the excited state potentials that can be employed in the optical transfer .",
    "in addition , a resonant term in the interaction leads to a @xmath31 scaling of the excited state potentials as opposed to the @xmath32 scaling in the ground state , implying that ground and excited state potentials do not line up favorably for transfer from weakly to deeply bound levels .",
    "while adding some complexity to the system , the four - photon scheme allows acceptable , albeit low , fc factors for coherent state transfer . specifically , both excited state intermediate levels @xmath33 and @xmath34belong to the mixed singlet / triplet @xmath13 coupled system , as illustrated in fig.[icapfig2]a",

    "the lifetime of the molecular population in @xmath14 was on the order of 20 ms , limited by off - resonant excitation by the lattice light .",

    "the rectangular shape of the first brillouin zone can clearly be seen .",
    "we deduce that 92(3 ) % of the molecular population resides in the lowest lattice vibrational level . for comparison ,",
    "the lower left inset in fig.[icapfig3]b shows molecular population transferred to higher lattice vibrational levels by amplitude modulation of the lattice during hold time @xmath64 with a frequency that matches the energy spacing between two lattice vibrational levels . by applying lattice amplitude and phase modulation and varying the modulation frequency we can map out the energy structure of the lattice bands for the @xmath63-molecules and deduce their dynamical polarizability .",
    "we find that the polarizability of the @xmath63-molecules is 1.05 @xmath74 the polarizability of the feshbach molecules @xcite , such that the magic wavelength condition is well fulfilled .",

    "improved stirap efficiency : * transfer to the intermediate ground state level @xmath76 with improved stirap laser setup . a substantial increase in transfer efficiency as compared to the data in fig.[icapfig3]a",
    "is achieved by increasing the laser phase stability.,width=272 ]    our simulations , based on the time dependent solution of the 5-level quantum master equation including laser phase noise and loss out of the 5-level system due to spontaneous emission , show that the stirap transfer efficiency is currently limited by finite available laser power to drive the extremely weak transitions in the 4p - scheme and by phase fluctuations of the stirap lasers .",
    "in order to optimize sample purity and hence phase - space density for quantum - state resolved collisional studies and the preparation of a bec of ground state molecules , we have recently optimized both the short term phase coherence and the long term stability of our transfer lasers .",
    "for short term stability on the timescale of an individual stirap transfer process , a pound - drever - hall lock with a feedback bandwidth of several mhz suppresses fast noise .",
    "in addition , we have modified the diode laser external grating feedback setup to essentially increase the laser resonator length to reduce phase noise .",
    "these improvements are combined with a slow phase lock of all stirap lasers to a common reference laser via the optical frequency comb . for this , we have implemented a transfer oscillator scheme , which eliminates the correlated noise contributions from the optical frequency comb and allows the transfer of the phase information of the reference laser to distinct regions of the optical spectrum @xcite . testing the improved locking scheme on the fist stirap step to @xmath77 , we have been able to improve the single pass efficiency by a substantial amount from @xmath180% to @xmath190% , as evidenced in fig.[icapfig4 ] .",
    "this indicates that the limitations to transfer efficiency are mainly technical .",
    "additional technical improvements are expected to improve this efficiency further and a similar increase is expected for the second stirap transition .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to prepare with high fidelity a sample of rovibronic ground - state molecules at ultralow temperatures in the presence of an optical lattice .",
    "if the collisional properties of the ground state molecules turn out to be sufficiently favorable , the preparation of a bec of ground state molecules should be possible .",
    "the most important obstacle to bec formation would be an open channel for inelastic collisions in a dimer - dimer collision .",
    "however , it is known from ab - initio calculations that the channel for the formation of a trimer and an atom in a dimer - dimer collision is energetically closed for the alkali dimers @xcite .",
    "we believe that our results can be generalized to the case of heteronuclear diatomic molecules such as rbcs . we have dedicated a separate experimental apparatus to this molecule @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the molecule krb is not stable @xcite under the process krb + krb @xmath78 k@xmath0 + rb@xmath0 . in principle",
    ", we expect that at ultralow temperatures and in the lowest hyperfine sublevel of the rovibronic ground state of the rbcs molecule @xcite only molecular three - body collisions present a possible limitation to performing experiments with dipolar many - body systems .",
    "as before , to optimize the overall molecule production efficiency by minimizing collisional loss during the preparation procedure , we will implement the feshbach association process and the ground state transfer in the presence of the optical lattice with precisely one molecule per lattice site .",
    "evidently , the preparation of the initial two - atom mott - insulator states is more involved than for the case of cs@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the central question is how to generate a many - body state in the lattice for which the number of rb - cs pairs as precursors to rbcs molecules is maximized . in view of considerable cs - cs and in particular rb - cs three - body loss",

    "the two becs initially reside in two separate dipole traps .",
    "we will exploit the fact that the rb - cs interaction can be controlled near a rb - cs interspecies feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the central idea is to first freeze out the cs sample using the sf - mi phase transition in such a way that at first a state with precisely one cs atom per lattice site is generated . the rb sample , much more mobile as a result of a lower polarizability for the rb atoms ,",
    "is then brought to overlap with the cs sample while being still superfluid . for small repulsive or even weakly attractive rb - cs interaction one",
