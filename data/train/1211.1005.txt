    "major mergers are another possible process at work , but the major merger rate seems to be insufficient to explain the observed evolution . more frequent minor mergers are currently considered the most likely explanation for the evolution of galaxy sizes , since they reduce the effective stellar densities , strongly increasing the galaxy size while leaving the mass almost unaffected ( khochfar & silk 2006 , naab et al .",

    "two new aspects that have been recently highlighted may lead to a modification of the current paradigm of size evolution .",
    "the first one has been the detection of a significant fraction of superdense galaxies with radii and masses comparable to high - z galaxies in nearby galaxy clusters ( valentinuzzi et al .",
    "2010a , hereafter v10 ) and in clusters at intermediate redshift ( valentinuzzi et al .",
    "this may imply a strong environmental dependence of the distribution of massive and compact galaxies in the local universe , but no study so far has carried out a detailed comparison between clusters and field at low - z .",
    "the second aspect concerns the effects of galaxy selection in the high - z samples .",
    "several studies have found that smaller galaxies have older stellar populations . as a result , by selecting galaxies that are already passive , high - z studies might be preferentially selecting the most compact ones ( valentinuzzi et al .",

    "we show our results for the fraction , number density and properties of superdense galaxies in the field , comparing with clusters in  4 .",
    "the mass - size relation for different types of galaxies , different stellar population ages and as a function of environment is discussed in  5 .",
    "we conclude by comparing with previous works (  6 ) and summarizing our results (  7 ) .",

    ", 14% of all galaxies and 25% of sdgs in our spectroscopic pm2gc sample do not have an sdss spectrum .",

    "galaxies which have no neighbour or solely one with a projected mutual distance @xmath21 and a redshift within 1500@xmath22 are considered `` single '' galaxies or `` binary - system '' galaxies , respectively .    the pm2gc sample is complete for masses @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , corresponding to the mass of the faintest and reddest galaxy ( @xmath25 , b - v = 0.9 ) at our redshift upper limit ( z = 0.1 ) , as described in calvi et al . ( 2012 ) . in this paper , however , we consider only those 1057 galaxies with @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) to be consistent with the cluster work from valentinuzzi et al .",
    "surface profile fits were obtained for 94% of these galaxies as outlined below .",
    "hereafter , we will use the mass - limited sample with radii estimates consisting of 995 galaxies at z=0.03 - 0.11 .",
    "effective - radii , axial ratios and sersic indexes are measured on mgc b - band images with gasphot ( pignatelli & fasano et al .",
    "2006 , bindoni et al . in prep .",
    ") , an automated tool which performs a simultaneous fit of the major and minor axis light growth curves with a 2d flattened sersic - law , convolved by the appropriate , space - varying psf . in this way",
    "gasphot exploits the robustness of the 1d fitting technique , keeping at the same time the capability ( typical of the 2d approach ) of dealing with psf convolution in the innermost regions .",
    "gasphot has proved to be very efficient in recovering the best fitting parameters , and to give the appropriate weight to the external parts of the galaxies , where psf effects are negligible .",
    "indeed we tested gasphot on more than 15,000 simulated and real galaxies , obtaining robust upper limits for the errors of the global parameters of galaxies , even for non - sersic profiles and blended objects ( pignatelli & fasano 2006 ) . the @xmath28 error ( median difference between retrieved and input value ) is -0.004@xmath290.003 and -0.030@xmath290.024 for simulated @xmath30 and @xmath31 galaxies , respectively , and -0.057@xmath290.101 for real galaxies .",
    "gasphot was also tested against the widely used tools galfit ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) and gim2d ( marleau & simard 1998 ) .",
    "it was found ( pignatelli & fasano 2006 ) that the performances of these tools are quite similar for large and regular simulated galaxies , while gasphot has proved to be more robust for real galaxies with some kind of irregularity , which is a crucial feature when dealing with blind surface photometry of huge galaxy samples .",
    "the gasphot output effective radius @xmath32   value is calculated along the major - axis , and for the purposes of this paper is circularized with the usual formula : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the major- and minor - axis of the best - fit model , respectively .            besides our own size measurements , there are four other independent size estimates for pm2gc galaxies : gim2d sersic fits from the millennium galaxy catalogue data ( allen et al .",
    "2006 ) , new york university value added catalogue ( nyuvac ) radii ( blanton et al . 2005 ) , gim2d sersic fits from sloan dr7 data ( simard et al . 2011 ) , and dr7/sdss de vaucouleurs sizes accessed via the catalog archive server ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 , thakar et al .",
    "2008 ) , the last three being based on sloan @xmath18-band data .    figure  [ fig : re ] shows the comparison between gasphot and gim2d(mgc)+nyuvac+simard size estimates for the 618 galaxies in common among the four samples .",
    "the agreement is generally good , with a tendency for gasphot radii to be larger than the others .",
    "the median difference between pm2gc radii and gim2d / nyuvac / simard radii is 0.03@xmath290.04/0.03@xmath290.06/-0.01@xmath290.04dex for all galaxies and 0.01@xmath290.08/-0.12@xmath36/-0.06@xmath290.11dex for superdense galaxies ( sdgs ) as defined in  3 .",
    "therefore , for sdgs the sloan - based estimates tend to be slightly larger than the mgc - based estimates , by a factor 1.3 and 1.1 for the nyuvac and the simard catalogues , respectively .",
    "the effect is clearly very small , especially when using gim2d on sloan data .    since there are previous low - z studies that have used de vaucoulers dr7 radii ( taylor et al .",
    "2010 , trujillo et al .",
    "2011 ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig : re ] we also show the comparison between dr7 size estimates obtained for a de vaucoulers ( n=4 ) fit and both gasphot and nyuvac radii ( 764 in common among the three samples ) .",
    "the nyuvac estimates have been obtained from the same data ( sloan g - band imaging ) of the de vaucoulers radii . as could be expected , the agreement is good for @xmath37 , but de vaucoulers radii are much larger for lower @xmath38 values , where most of the galaxies and , as we will see , most of our sdgs are found .      ]",
    "galaxy stellar mass estimates were derived by calvi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using the bell & de jong ( 2001 ) relation which correlates the stellar mass - to - light ratio with the optical colours of the integrated stellar population , using the b - band photometry taken from the mgc , and the rest - frame b - v color computed from the sloan @xmath39 color corrected for galactic extinction ( see calvi et al .",
    "2011 for details ) .",
    "the typical uncertainty on stellar mass estimates is 0.2 - 0.3dex .",
    "figure  [ fig : masses ] shows that there is no systematic difference between our mass estimates and dr7 ones , and the scatter is @xmath40dex .",
    "the median mass difference ( @xmath41 ( dr7 ) ) is -0.01@xmath290.07dex and 0.02@xmath290.1dex for all and sdg galaxies , respectively .      to morphologically classify galaxies , we used morphot , an automatic tool designed to reproduce as closely as possible the visual classifications ( fasano et al .",
    "morphot adds to the classical cas ( concentration/ asymmetry / clumpiness ) parameters a set of additional indicators derived from digital imaging of galaxies and has been proved to give an uncertainty only slightly larger than the eyeball estimates ( fasano et al .",
    "morphot was applied to the b - band mgc images to identify ellipticals , lenticulars ( s0s ) and later - type galaxies .",
    "these are the three broad morphological classes we will use in this paper ( see calvi et al .",
    "2012 for details ) .",
    "it is well known that separating ellipticals from s0s could be sometimes challenging even for human experienced classifiers .",
    "the challenge is obviously enhanced when dealing with compact objects like sdgs .",
    "that being stated , the morphot ability of recognizing visually classified s0 galaxies on mgc - like imaging has been shown to be of the order of @xmath42% ( see figure 11 in fasano et al .",
    "2012 ; see also figures 6 and 16 therein ) , which is comparable to the level of agreement reached by different experienced visual classifiers .",
    "the mgc spectroscopic database of pm2gc galaxies consists of sdss , 2dfgrs and mgcz spectra ( driver et al .",
    "2005 ) , the latter taken with the same instrument and setup of the 2dfgrs .",
    "choosing always the highest quality spectrum available , we preferred to use sdss spectra when possible ( 858 cases , 86% of the sample ) , alternatively 2dfgrs spectra when available ( 93 cases ) and mgcz spectra in the remaining cases .",
    "sdss spectra are flux - calibrated , while we performed a relative flux calibration for all 2df spectra using the response curve provided by the 2df team ( http : www.mso.anu.edu.au2dfgrs ) and a refined , second order calibration using a curve derived by the ratio between the 2df spectra and the corresponding sdss spectra for objects with both spectra available , as described in cava et al .",

    ", we fitted the spectra with the spectro - photometric model fully described in fritz et al .",
    "all the main spectro - photometric features ( such as the continuum flux and shape , and the equivalent widths of emission and absorption lines ) are reproduced by summing the theoretical spectra of simple stellar population ( ssp ) of 12 different ages ( from @xmath43 to @xmath44 years ) .",
    "dust extinction is allowed to vary as a function of ssp age , in a screen uniformly distributed in front of the ssp stars .",

    "( 1984 ) library for young ssps , and in the uv and infrared by means of the kurucz theoretical library .",
    "nebular emission is included , modeled with values that are typical of hii regions : this significantly affects spectra of ssps younger than @xmath48 years .    from our spectral analysis",
    ", it is possible to derive an estimate of the average age of the stars in a galaxy . following the definition of cid - fernandes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we compute the luminosity  weighted ( lw ) age by weighting the age of each ssp composing the integrated spectrum with its bolometric flux .",
    "this provides an estimate of the average age of the stars weighted by the light we actually observe .",
    "a mass  weighted ( mw ) age is computed in a similar way : each ssp age is weighted with its mass value .",
    "the mass  weighted age is the `` true '' average age of the galaxy s stars . by construction , the mw age is always older than the lw age .",

    "the data , methods of analysis , galaxy mass ranges and selection criteria differ from one study to another , but all these works , with the exception of van der wel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that have used a visual morphological classification , have selected galaxies to be already passively evolving with old stellar populations at the redshift they are observed , based on sed spectral fitting , absence of emission lines , line index age dating and other spectrophotometric techniques .",
    "sdg candidates complying these criteria have been individually inspected , to check their size and mass estimates .",
    "a merging system has been excluded from the analysis . when the gasphot and gim2d estimates significantly disagreed , a galaxy - by - galaxy analysis performed with _",
    "iraf _ was used to decide which radius was the most accurate .",
    "most of these cases are galaxies with a nearby galaxy or star .",
    "there were three galaxies for which the dr7 mass estimate agreed with the mass obtained using sdss cas magnitudes but disagreed with the pm2gc mass .",
    "for these , the sdss cas mass was adopted .",
    "this left a total sample of 44 sdgs .",
    "the fraction of sdgs among pm2gc galaxies with masses @xmath55 is @xmath56% .",
    "the corresponding number density of sdgs within the pm2gc volume is @xmath57 .",
    "we note that if we used only literature information the fraction of sdgs would be only slightly lower , but still comparable within the statistical error , 3.7@xmath58% using gim2d radii and dr7 masses and 3.3@xmath58% for nyuvac radii and dr7 masses .",
    "we also note that the fraction of pm2gc galaxies and pm2gc sdgs with a size measurement from the nyuvac are 85% and 73% , and the fractions with dr7 masses are 86% and 75% , respectively .",
    "this supports the notion that the sdss sample might be indeed slightly biased against compact massive galaxies ( less complete for compact than non - compact galaxies ) , as discussed in detail by other authors ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fig : all ] that our sdg definition corresponds to galaxies with sizes more than 2@xmath51 smaller than the median mass - size relation .",
    "the region at radii below and densities above the solid straight line is the  zone of avoidance  where galaxies are rare in the atlas3d sample of 260 nearby early - type galaxies , a complete and statistically representative sample of the nearby early - type population ( cappellari et al .",
    "our sdgs are truly exceptionally dense objects , and outliers in the local mass - radius and mass - density relations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : distri2 ] we compare the distributions of galaxy mass , radius and density values of the pm2gc sdg sample with those of the high - z sdg data , together with the cluster low - z wings sample that will be discussed later .",
    "we do this to check that in the local universe we are selecting galaxies with a `` degree of compactness '' that is comparable to that of high - z galaxies . for masses ,",
    "we plot the simple distributions , while for radii and densities we plot the offset with respect to the high - z median mass - radius and mass - density relations obtained using all the high - z samples considered in this paper .",
    "the pm2gc , wings and high - z distributions largely overlap ( cf .",
    "fig.7 in taylor et al .",
    "however , the low - z and high - z distributions do not coincide , and they are not expected to , simply because the low - mass datasets are mass - limited galaxy samples , while the high - z histograms are the results of a collection of different surveys , with different mass ranges , selection criteria etc . as a result , the mass distributions at high- and low - z differ , with the high - z histogram being more populated at high masses than the local samples , and the consequent differences are visible also in the radii and density panels .",
    "nevertheless , the large overlap of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 distributions of low - z and high - z sdgs shows that we are indeed comparing local and distant samples of galaxies with a large overlap in degree of compactness and density .",
    "we note however that @xmath6 datapoints ( yellow histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : distri2 ] ) have more prominent low - radii and high - densities tails with respect to the @xmath61 distributions .",
    "this is mainly due to the van dokkum et al .",

    "( 2011 ) datapoints resemble the @xmath61 distribution .",
    "it is unclear whether the fact that @xmath6 galaxies seem to be extreme in their compactness is due to rapid evolution between @xmath8 and @xmath62 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2012 ) or selection effects ( saracco et al .",

    "<S> we search for massive and compact galaxies ( superdense galaxies , hereafter sdgs ) at @xmath0 in the padova - millennium galaxy and group catalogue , a spectroscopically complete sample representative of the local universe general field population . </S>",
    "<S> we find that compact galaxies with radii and mass densities comparable to high - z massive and passive galaxies represent 4.4% of all galaxies with stellar masses above @xmath1 , yielding a number density of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> most of them are s0s ( 70% ) or ellipticals ( 23% ) , are red and have intermediate - to - old stellar populations , with a median luminosity - weighted age of 5.4 gyr and a median mass - weighted age of 9.2 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the small radii and high stellar mass estimates . </S>",
    "<S> comparing with the wings sample of cluster galaxies at similar redshifts , the fraction of superdense galaxies is three times smaller in the field than in clusters , and cluster sdgs are on average 4 gyr older than field sdgs . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the existence of a universal trend of smaller radii for older luminosity - weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass . as a consequence , the median mass - size relation shifts towards smaller radii for galaxies with older stars , but </S>",
    "<S> the effect is much more pronounced in clusters than in the field . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , on top of the well known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass , the luminosity - weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixed mass , and , for a fixed mass and radius , on environment . </S>",
    "<S> this effect needs to be taken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizes from high- to low - z . </S>",
    "<S> our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that a significant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high - z have evolved into compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today . </S>",
    "<S> when stellar age and environmental effects are taken into account , the average amount of size evolution of individual galaxies between high- and low - z is mild , a factor @xmath3 . </S>"
