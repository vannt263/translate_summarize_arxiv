    "at the beginning of this century , which is sometimes called the century of physics , we were presented with two revolutionary physical theories : the theory of relativity and the quantum theory .",
    "the common feature of these theories ( and , perhaps , of the whole physics in this century ) is their _ counterintuitive _ character .",
    "it would be beyond the scope of this paper to analyze the intellectual background at the turn of the century that made scientists so much attracted by everything against intuition .",
    "no doubt , in the twenties century physics  the logical basis is getting farther and farther from the empirical data , and the mental way leading to theorems directly related to the empirical observations is getting more and more long and hard \" ( einstein , 1938 ) .",
    "i believe , however , that in quantum mechanics we swung to the other extreme by enforcing counterintuitive abstractions , instead of struggling for real explanations .",
    "the target of my critique is the _ quantum probability theory _ and _ quantum logic_. the story begins with von neumann s recognition , that quantum mechanics _ can be regarded _ as a kind of probability theory defined over the subspace lattice @xmath0 of a hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "this recognition was confirmed by the _ gleason theorem _ :    [ probmeasure ] a non negative real function @xmath2 on @xmath0 is called a probability measure if @xmath3 and if whenever @xmath4 are pairwise orthogonal subspaces , and @xmath5 , then @xmath6 .",
    "[ gleason ] if @xmath7 is a real or complex hilbert space of dimension greater than 2 , and @xmath2 is a probability measure on @xmath0 , then there exists a density operator @xmath8 on @xmath7 , such that @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "formally , the intersection and the ( closed ) linear union of subspaces play the role of _ conjunction _ and _ disjunction _ in an underlying _ event _ lattice of a _",
    "probability theory_. in spite of some difficulties , it is commonly accepted that , for example , a conjunction @xmath10 , represented by the intersection of the corresponding subspaces , @xmath11 , corresponds to an event , which is nothing else , but the _ joint occurrence _ of events @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , we have , as we will see it soon , many difficulties with such an interpretation !",
    "while everything is clear from the mathematical point of view , the _ physical _ meaning assigned to the elements of the subspace lattice and to the lattice operations is far from obvious .",
    "the quantum probability  quantum logic approach is based on the conviction that there are phenomena described by quantum mechanics which can not be accommodated in the classical kolmogorov theory of probability .",
    "the majority of authors are shearing this conviction : jauch ( 1968 ) , bub ( 1974 ) , putnam ( 1974 ) , piron ( 1976 ) , mittelstaedt ( 1978 ) , beltrametti and cassinelli ( 1981 ) , gudder ( 1988 ) , pitowsky ( 1989 ) , kmmerer and maassen ( 1996 ) and many others . due to feynmann ( 1951 )",
    "this opinion is quite common among the users of quantum mechanics but who do not care to much with foundational questions .",
    "there has been a serious critique against this approach .",
    "the first paper pointing out the pitfalls of quantum logic was published by strauss ( 1937 ) a year after the famous birkhoff and neumann ( 1936 ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning a few papers of the last years arguing against non - classical probabilities : ballentine ( 1989 ) , costantini ( 1992 ) , szab ( 1995a , b ) , gill ( 1996 ) .",
    "it seems to me that quantum probabilitists completely ignore the serious pitfalls pointed out by these authors .",
    "bell expressed quite a similar disappointment :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ why did such serious people take so seriously axioms which now seem so arbitrary ?",
    "i suspect that they were misled by the pernicious misuse of the word ` measurement ' in contemporary theory .",
    "this word very strongly suggests the ascertaining of some preexisting property of some thing , any instrument involved playing a purely passive role .",
    "quantum experiments are just not like that , as we learned especially from bohr .",
    "the results have to be regarded as the joint product of ` system ' and ` apparatus , ' the complete experimental set - up . but",
    "the misuse of the word ` measurement ' makes it easy to forget this and then to expect that the ` results of measurements ' should obey some simple logic in which the apparatus is not mentioned .",
    "the resulting difficulties soon show that any such logic is not ordinary logic .",
    "it is my impression that the whole vast subject of ` quantum logic ' has arisen in this way from the misuse of a word .",
    "i am convinced that the word ` measurement ' has now been so abused that the field would be significantly advanced by banning its use altogether , in favor for example of the word ` experiment . ' _",

    "[ nonsensical ] i will show that whenever we consider non - commuting element of @xmath0 nonsensical  probabilities \" can appear which can hardly be interpreted as relative frequencies of any events . in section  [ need ]",

    "these examples are usually meant to illustrate why we need to create a new , non - classical theory of probability . in both cases , however , it will be shown that no need to supersede the kolmogorov theory of probability . in section  [ howtojoin ]",
    "we will see how can quantum phenomena , in general , be accommodated in the classical kolmogorov theory of probability .",
    "sometimes quantum mechanics produces very strange values of  probabilities \" . let me give a simple example .      consider a system described in a 2-dimensional hilbert space @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be two orthogonal unit vectors .",
    "suppose that the system is in the pure state @xmath17 .",

    "the intersection is @xmath23 .",
    "the probabilities of the corresponding events are @xmath24    if @xmath25 is close to zero then , for example , @xmath26    it is , however , _",
    "impossible _ to interpret similar numbers as _ relative frequencies _ of occurrences of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "it is easy to see , that probabilities can not be interpreted as relative frequencies if the following inequality is violated : @xmath29    to better understand the significance of the above example it is necessary to make a few remarks :    * if @xmath19 and @xmath21 commute then inequality ( [ 1 ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "* at first sight one could think that the difficulties related with conjunctions occur only if the system is in a special state .",

    "* equation @xmath32 implies inequality ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , von neumann regarded ( [ neumann ] ) as a fundamental property of a probability measure , which should be required in the quantum case , too.(cf .",
    "rdei , forthcoming )      it is not surprising that the appearance of nonsensical probabilities is related with non - commutative projectors .",
    "i must , however , emphasize that the naturality of this fact does not justify at all the adherence to nonsensical probabilities .",
    "[ en ] let @xmath19 and @xmath21 be non - commuting elements of @xmath0 .",

    "according to the usual interpretation the double slit experiment shows that  _ the method of computing probabilities involving subatomic particles is different from that of classical probability theory _ \" ( gudder 1988 , p. 57 ) .",
    "therefore we must , as the usual conclusion says , 1 )  change probabilities for complex amplitudes ( feynmann ) or 2 )  give up the booleanan event lattice ( quantum logic ) and classical probability theory(quantum probability theory ) .",
    "_ contrary _ to these conclusions , let me ask :      there are two different ways in which we can correctly describe the double slit experiment within the framework of classical probability theory . in both cases ,",
    "it is the precise usage of notions  event \" and  disjunction \" what makes the classical probability theory satisfactory , while the formula ( [ doulenoneq ] ) is , as we will see it soon , based on the misuse of these notions .",
    "we must precisely distinguish the following events :    *  slit 1 is open and slit 2 is closed and the particle is detected at @xmath64 \" *  slit 1 is closed and slit 2 is open and the particle is detected at @xmath64 \" *  slit 1 is open and slit 2 is open and the particle is detected at @xmath64 \"    obviously , @xmath65 consequently we are not surprised that @xmath66 that is , formula ( [ doulenoneq ] ) is incorrect , consequently there is no violation of classical rules of probability calculation .",

    "consequently , it does not mean a violation of the kolmogorov axioms if @xmath67      we have seen in the previous subsection that the double slit experiment does not prove the nonapplicability of kolmogorov s classical theory of probability .",
