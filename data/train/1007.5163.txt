    "<S> we have studied the production of the @xmath0 charmonium state , @xmath1 , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the framework of non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) using heavy - quark symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nrqcd predicts a large production cross - section for this resonance at the lhc even after taking account the small branching ratio of @xmath1 into two photons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it will be possible to test nrqcd through its predictions for @xmath1 , with the statistics that will be achieved at the early stage of the lhc , running at a center of mass energy of 7 tev with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite is an effective theory that has been extensively used to study the production and decay of quarkonia . </S>",
    "<S> nrqcd is derived from the qcd lagrangian by neglecting all states of momenta much larger than the heavy quark mass , @xmath3 and to account for this exclusion by adding new interaction terms in the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> it is then possible to expand the quarkonium state in - terms of @xmath4 , the relative velocity of the heavy quarks in the bound state . in this expansion </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath5 pair in the intermediate state can be in either colour - singlet or colour - octet configurations denoted by @xmath6}]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the colour - octet @xmath5 state evolves non - perturbatively into a physical colour - singlet state by emission of one or more soft gluons . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for production of a quarkonium state @xmath7 can be factorised as : ( h)=_n=\\{,s , l , j } f_n^d_n-4 ^h_n(^2s+1l_j ) , [ factorizn ] where @xmath8 s are the short - distance coefficients and @xmath9 are operators of naive dimension @xmath10 , describing the long - distance effects . </S>",
    "<S> these non - perturbative matrix elements are guaranteed to be energy - independent due to the nrqcd factorization formula , so that they may be extracted at a given energy and used to predict quarkonium cross - sections at other energies . before the effective theory approach of nrqcd </S>",
    "<S> was developed , the colour - singlet model ( csm )  @xcite was used to analyze the production of quarkonia , where the @xmath11 state produced in the short - distance process was assumed to be a colour - singlet . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was pointed out in ref .  @xcite that contributions from the colour - octet operators are significant in describing the phenomenology of large-@xmath12 @xmath13-state charmonium production at the tevatron @xcite . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the complete set of short - distance coefficients in nrqcd needed to study @xmath14 and @xmath15 production was calculated and compared with the data from tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> these nrqcd calculations gave a good description of the shapes of the @xmath12 distributions of the charmonium resonances at the tevatron but the normalization of these distributions was not predicted in nrqcd i.e. the non - perturbative matrix elements which determined the normalization had to be obtained by a fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> independent tests of the effective theory approach were , therefore , necessary to determine the validity of the approach and , indeed , various proposals were made @xcite to test nrqcd . </S>",
    "<S> but several of these proposals are not for large-@xmath12 quarkonium production and the validity of nrqcd factorization at low-@xmath12 is suspect . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting test of nrqcd comes from the study of the polarization of @xmath14 s at large-@xmath12 @xcite which primarily comes from a fragmentation - like processes where a single gluon splits into a @xmath11 pair which inherits the transverse polarization of the gluon . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy - quark symmetry of nrqcd then comes into play in protecting this transverse polarization in the non - perturbative evolution of the @xmath11 pair into a @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the large-@xmath12 @xmath14 is , therefore , strongly transversely polarized . </S>",
    "<S> this is not true at even moderately low @xmath12 where the @xmath14 is essentially unpolarized . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 dependence of the polarization is , therefore , a very good test of the theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the cdf experiment has measured the @xmath12-dependence of the polarization and they find no evidence for any transverse polarization at large @xmath12 @xcite , which seems to indicate a dramatic failure of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> inspite of the successful prediction of the production cross - sections of the various charmonium resonances it may well be that the effective theory is missing out on some aspect of the physics of quarkonium formation . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it could be that the charm quark is too light to be treated in nrqcd . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> polarization measurements are usually fraught with problems and it may well be that the problem is elsewhere . finally , </S>",
    "<S> because the colour - singlet channel predicts unpolarized @xmath14 s , there have been attempts to increase up the colour - singlet contribution to the production processes by invoking reggeized gluons @xcite or enhanced effects of higher - order qcd corrections in the singlet channel @xcite . for reviews of the current status of these calculations and their experimental consequences , </S>",
    "<S> see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , it is worthwhile looking for other tests of nrqcd which successfully navigate between low-@xmath12 and polarization </S>",
    "<S> . the heavy - quark symmetry of nrqcd provides a set of relations between non - perturbative parameters of different resonances so a measurement of a given state yields information on the non - perturbative parameter of another state related to the former by heavy - quark symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has been exploited to study @xmath16 production at the tevatron @xcite and , more recently , at the lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly @xmath1 production at the tevatron has also been studied @xcite . in this paper , we study the production of @xmath1 at the lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> the fock space expansion of the physical @xmath1 , which is a @xmath0 ( @xmath17 ) state , is : |_c>=o(1 )    colour - singlet @xmath0 state contributes at @xmath18 . as the @xmath13-state production is itself down by factor of @xmath19 both the colour - octet @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels effectively contribute at the same order . </S>",
    "<S> the colour - octet state @xmath22}$ ] ( @xmath23}$ ] ) becomes a physical @xmath1 by emitting a gluon in an e1 ( m1 ) transition . </S>",
    "<S> keeping terms up - to @xmath24 the @xmath1 production cross section can be parameterized as : ( _ c)&= & + & & + + , where the coefficients , @xmath25 s , are the cross sections for the production of @xmath26 pair in the respective angular momentum and colour states . </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section for @xmath26 pair production with specific angular momentum and colour states at the lhc is given by : & & ( p p [ ^2s+1l^[1,8]_j ] x)= + & & dy dx_1  x_1g_a / p ( x_1 )  x_2g_b / p(x_2 ) ( abd ) , [ eq : diff ] where the summation is over the partons ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , the final state @xmath5 is in the @xmath29}_0 $ ] , @xmath30}_1 $ ] , @xmath31}_1 $ ] states and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the distributions of partons @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the protons and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the respective momentum they carry . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 is related with @xmath34 as : x_2= , where @xmath36  with   @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath40 is the mass of the resonance and @xmath41 is the rapidity at which the resonance is produced . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining coefficient @xmath44 $ ] has been calculated and used in  @xcite to analyze @xmath1 production at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we use heavy quark spin - symmetry to obtain the values of @xmath45 s from the experimentally predicted values @xmath46 s . using this symmetry the @xmath47 s </S>",
    "<S> are related as : & = & 1 3 ( 1 + o(v^2 ) ) , + & = & ( 1 + o(v^2 ) ) , + & = & ( 1 + o(v^2 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ ovalues ] we use the predicted value of the singlet matrix elements listed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( @xmath48 @xmath49 \\left| 0 \\right>=1.2 $ ] gev@xmath50 ) and the octet matrix elements extracted from the cdf @xmath14 data  @xcite ( i. e. @xmath51 @xmath52\\left| 0 \\right > } { m_c^2}+ \\frac{\\left < 0 \\right|{\\cal o}_8^{j/\\psi}[^1s_0]\\left| 0 \\right>}{3 } = ( 2.2\\pm0.5)\\times 10^{-2}$ ] gev@xmath50 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be noted that only a linear combination @xmath53 can be extracted from the cdf data as the shapes of @xmath54 and @xmath55 contributions to the @xmath14 @xmath12-distribution are almost identical . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for predicting the @xmath1 rate we assume that either @xmath54 or @xmath55 saturates the sum so that our predictions indicate the band within which we expect the experimental value of the @xmath1 production cross - section to lie . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , we consider the two extreme cases where in the first case , the maximum possible contribution is from the @xmath56}_1 $ ] channel and none from the @xmath57}_1 $ ] channel whereas in the second case the @xmath57}_1 $ ] contributes its maximum while the @xmath56}_1 $ ] channel does not contribute .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1 ] we have displayed the differential cross section @xmath58 as a function of @xmath12 at two different center - of - mass energies , viz . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 7 and 14 tev respectively , where @xmath60 is the @xmath61 branching ratio ( @xmath62 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have used cteq 5l lo parton densities @xcite evolved to a scale @xmath63 . in both ( a ) and ( b ) of fig . 1 , we have curves marked i and ii where i is the sum of the colour - singlet and the @xmath23}$ ] contributions and ii is , likewise , the sum of the colour - singlet and the @xmath22}$ ] contribution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also display the colour - singlet curve in both the figures , to bring out the fact that the octet contributions overwhelmingly dominate the cross - section . to account for the experimental threshold in @xmath12 for the photons which is about 10 gev </S>",
    "<S> , we use a lower-@xmath12 cut of 20 gev on the @xmath1 to calculate the integrated cross - sections . for the lhc running at @xmath64 tev , with an integrated luminosity ( @xmath65 ) of 100 pb@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the number of events in the @xmath66 channel from the singlet @xmath67}$ ] is about 40 while the number of events from @xmath23}$ ] is about @xmath68 when @xmath22}$ ] contribution is neglected , while the number of events from @xmath22}$ ] is about 37660 when @xmath23}$ ] contribution is absent . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of @xmath69 tev and @xmath70 100 pb@xmath2 , the respective numbers would be 100 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the minimum @xmath61 events at the lhc running at @xmath64 and 14 tev will be 37700 and @xmath72 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1 ] that the shapes of the @xmath23}$ ] and the @xmath22}$ ] contributions to the @xmath12-distribution is different and may allow the non - perturbative matrix elements @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be individually determined . </S>",
    "<S> we have noted earlier that the @xmath14 cross - section does not provide such a separation . </S>",
    "<S> but it is also pertinent to note that the integrated cross - sections are also very sensitive to the the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 and so the measurement of the integrated cross - section alone may provide this discriminatory ability .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-2 ] we have displayed the effect of increasing the @xmath12-cut on the magnitude of the integrated cross - section . as explained earlier , the cut on @xmath12 of the @xmath1 will be determined by the minimum @xmath12 threshold that the experiments use to trigger on the photons , for which the usual choice is 10 gev . in case </S>",
    "<S> the experiments use a larger cut on the @xmath12 of the photons in order to improve the quality of their signal , the @xmath12 cut on the @xmath1 will be correspondingly higher . </S>",
    "<S> we see , from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , that even when the cut on the minimum @xmath12 is as large as 50 gev , the cross - section is substantial .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tab : events ] minimum and maximum number of @xmath1 events expected at the lhc for an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -0.2 cm    we also have analyzed the effect on the cross - section of the variation of the qcd scale , the parton densities and the non - perturbative matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> table   [ tab : events ] shows the variation in the minimum and maximum number of @xmath1 events with scale @xmath73 , expected at the lhc running at @xmath64 and 14 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cross section decreases by about 25 - 30% changing the scale from @xmath63 to @xmath74 and it increases by 40 - 50% for the scale choice @xmath75 instead of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the cross section decreases by about 10 - 20% if we use mrst lo densities  @xcite instead of cteq5l lo  @xcite densities . since the heavy - quark symmetry is an approximate symmetry we can expect about 30% variation in the values of the non - perturbative matrix elements we have used . </S>",
    "<S> all through we have considered only the direct production of @xmath1 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> however , an additional contribution to @xmath1 signal comes from the decays of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated that this additional contribution to the signal coming from @xmath14 decays can change our predictions by about 1% as br(@xmath76 and the @xmath14 production cross section is expected to be of same order of @xmath1 production cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to remark that such an analysis may also be carried out for the bottomonium resonance @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding non - perturbative parameters in that case , however , are very poorly determined and suffer from large errors .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the heavy - quark symmetry of nrqcd allows us to make predictions for @xmath1 production at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the integrated cross - section and the @xmath12 distribution of @xmath1 at the lhc will provide a very good test of nrqcd . </S>",
    "<S> we show that nrqcd predicts a large cross - section for @xmath1 at the lhc even at @xmath78 tev and so this prediction is easily testable . </S>"
