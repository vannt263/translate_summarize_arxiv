    "the transistor can have a large gain since the target photons only generate a very small excitation probability for qubit 1 and a large number of photons can therefore be reflected without appreciably affecting a single photon control pulse at qubit 2 .",
    "the achievable gain grows with increasing phase coherence time @xmath40 of the qubits since a longer phase coherence time allows to use target pulses of larger temporal and thus smaller spectral width which result in a smaller probability for qubit 1 to be excited and hence a smaller back - action onto the control pulse .",

    "we furthermore assume that the target photons scatter independently of each other at qubit 1 .",
    "this assumption is very accurate for our setting since qubit 1 is mostly in its ground state and has a vanishingly small excitation probability .",
    "we note that the above estimate provides a lower bound for the gain of our transistor .",
    "indeed , the gain may be considerably larger in the complementary mode of operation , where the target photons are transmitted in the presence of a control photon but blocked in its absence , because the requirement that the control photon remains unperturbed is no longer necessary for that case .",
    "moreover , in the absence of the control photon , an arbitrarily large number of target photons can be transmitted without interacting with the qubits as they are sufficiently detuned from the transition frequency of qubit 1 .",
    "in this section we present explicit estimates for the performance of our device for the case where the pulses of the control and target photon have identical shapes .",

    "<S> yet to enable concatenation of multiple transistors , we choose @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the interaction of the target photon with qubit 1 should be as high as possible . </S>",

    "<S> a possible delay between both pulses can be detrimental to the contrast @xmath59 and on - off ratio @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> yet we find that the performance of the transistor is increasingly robust against such delays with increasing phase coherence time @xmath40 of the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> for example for @xmath85 a very good performance of the transistor is retained for delays up to @xmath86 , see supplemental material @xcite for details .    a conservative estimate for the effective gain of our transistor is provided by the maximal number of target photons that can be reflected due to the presence of a single control photon . </S>",
    "<S> since target photons only generate a very small excitation probability for qubit 1 and thus do not appreciably affect even `` single - photon '' control pulses , the effective gain can be high . </S>",
    "<S> it grows with increasing phase coherence time , @xmath40 , of the qubits and for example reaches 70 for @xmath85 , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , for the fully scalable case where both , control and target photons are inverting pulses with the same carrier frequency , @xmath87 , and pulse length , @xmath88 , we find that the contrast reaches @xmath89 for @xmath90 and a control photon that arrives @xmath91 ahead of the target photon , see @xcite . this strong influence of the control photon on the target photon despite their identical pulse shapes is enabled by the asymmetry of the device with a semi - infinite ( infinite ) transmission line for the control ( target ) photon and @xmath92 . </S>",
