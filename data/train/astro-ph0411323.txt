    "the globular cluster ( gc ) system of m31 has been the subject of intensive study , due to the similarity of m31 to the milky way , its proximity , and the large numbers of cataloged clusters . because the m31 gcs can be resolved into stars with @xmath4 ( hst ) imaging ( e.g. , ajhar et al .",
    "1996 ; rich et al . 1996 ; fusi pecci et al . 1996 ) , it is possible to explore how integrated colors depend on the stellar content of the gcs and to do so in a galaxy that overall resembles the milky way .",
    "the general properties of the m31 gc system are described in recent reviews by rich ( 2003 ) , jablonka ( 2002 ) , and barmby ( 2002 ) .",
    "a recent optical / infrared catalog is published in galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "previous ultraviolet ( uv ) missions obtained photometry for galactic gcs , beginning with the _ orbiting astronomical observatory _ ( oao2 ) , the _ astronomical netherlands satellite _ ( ans ) , the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) , and the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( uit ) ( dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 and references therein ) . the first uv imagery of the m31 gc system was obtained using the uit ( bohlin et al .",
    "however , the uit images from photographic film detected 43 gcs in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) , while only four clusters had solid far ultraviolet ( fuv ) detections .",
    "these early observations allowed bohlin et al . to compare the uv properties of a small sample of m31 gcs with those of galactic halo gcs and to conclude that the age range of the m31 gc system resembled closely that of the galactic gcs .",
    "however , a consistent and extensive set of uv photometry for the m31 gc system is an important next step in this effort .",
    "here we report on the first imagery of the m31 gc system using the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) satellite ( martin et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in old stellar populations such as gcs , because of the relative longevity , hot he - burning horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars and their progeny are likely dominant uv sources ( oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "other sources of uv light in old populations are more difficult to model : extreme blue hb stars , post - asymptotic giant - branch ( pagb ) stars , blue stragglers , and x - ray binaries .",
    "while metallicity is the dominant parameter controlling hb morphology in the oldest ( galactic halo - like ) stellar populations , a number of studies suggest that age differences between clusters are the most significant second parameter affecting hb morphology ( lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ) . population models also suggest that in a broad sense , fuv photometry may have the potential to constrain age spreads within a galaxy , and also between galaxies ( e.g. , yi 2003 ) .",
    "as our vision expands to consider more distant galaxies , the properties of the m31 and galactic gc systems play a significant role as templates because of the additional detailed information that we have about the clusters in these systems .",
    "galex imaged 15 slightly overlapping fields of m31 covering a total @xmath5 deg@xmath0 centered on m31 ; the mosaic covers most of the disk and halo of m31 ( bianchi et al . 2004 ; thilker et al .",
    "the observations were obtained from 2003 september through october .",
    "the exposure times range from 650 to 1700 seconds , with each observation being obtained during the shadow crossing of one orbit .",
    "the satellite and on orbit performance of galex are described in martin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and morrissey et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    using the daophotii / allstar package ( stetson 1987 ) , we performed aperture photometry and point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry for all detected objects in the galex m31 fields .",
    "although the psf - fitting was often successful , there is some variation of the psf within a field in these early images , and stellar images are often elongated , because of the as - yet imperfect removal of dithered pointing by image reduction pipeline .",
    "we consequently adopt aperture photometry for the final catalog . in order to deal with crowded fields ,",
    "we use a 4-pixel radius aperture and derive aperture corrections using isolated objects of moderate brightness .",
    "we found that the aperture corrections are stable at the 10% level ; our field - to - field variation across the m31 mosaic is also at the less than @xmath6 level .",
    "we expect this to improve in the final coadded data set .",
    "astrometry is obtained using objects for each field in common with the usno - a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "the final photometry is on the ab magnitude system ( oke 1990 ) .",
    "we adopt the catalog of barmby et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter b00 ) which gives positions for a large fraction of m31 gcs as well as optical magnitudes , reddening , and metallicity .",
    "our final catalog ( m. rich and s .- c .",
    "rey et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) based on the fully co - added images will also match the full bologna catalog ( galleti et al .",
    "2004 ) . for those clusters matching to less than @xmath7",
    ", we make subraster images ( figure 1 ) and verify the unique uv to optical match by visual inspection .",
    "we reject those clusters falling more than 0.55 deg from the field center ; the edge of the field has relatively poor positional accuracy and more severe image distortion . among the 435 cluster candidates of b00",
    ", we confirm 200 nuv and 94 fuv detections that have rms uv@xmath1optical positional agreement of less than @xmath8 .",
    "figure 2 shows the fraction of m31 gcs detected in the nuv and fuv bandpasses as a function of @xmath2 magnitude and @xmath9 color .",
    "of the 384 gcs with both @xmath2 and @xmath9 data in b00 , 190 ( about 50% ) and 89 ( about 23% ) gcs have been confirmed in nuv and fuv , respectively .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram and color histogram show that most of the confirmed gcs belong to blue clusters with @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to lack of uv flux , a variety of factors ( e.g. artifacts and uncertain identification ) may be responsible for the non - detection .",
    "our limiting magnitude for @xmath11 and @xmath12 is about 22 ab magnitude , which corresponds to 1 mag fainter than that of the uit observations .",
    "we detected seven ( nuv ) and five ( fuv ) of the gcs with x - ray emission in di stefano et al .",
    "while the detections range from 0.06 to 4.69@xmath13 we do not detect the two brightest x - ray clusters , bo375 and bo82 .    reddening corrections for individual clusters ( including foreground and internal to m31 ) are based on a list of @xmath14 kindly provided by p. barmby .",
    "we use the reddening law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) for @xmath15 = 8.90 and @xmath16 = 8.16 ( see also bianchi et al .",
    "in our all analyses , we used only m31 gcs with @xmath17 , which corresponds to the median value of the @xmath14 distribution of m31 gcs ( b00 ) , because uncertainty in the reddening and hence in the intrinsic colors increases for large values of @xmath14 ( barmby 2002 ) .",
    "how similar in broad - band colors are the m31 and galactic gcs ?",
    "figure 3 is the uv@xmath18 colors versus @xmath2 diagram for m31 gcs .",
    "we compare both our sample and earlier uv satellite photometry , with dereddened optical magnitudes of b00 .",
    "we convert magnitudes of the galactic and uit m31 gcs to those of the galex filter system using model spectral energy distributions for simple stellar populations ( yi 2003 ) .",
    "we place the galactic gcs on these plots using the m31 distance modulus of @xmath19 ( freedman & madore 1990 ) .",
    "the m31 and galactic gcs occupy the same locus in these plots , and we find no systematic difference between uit and galex photometry .",
    "bohlin et al . ( 1993 ) reported a deficiency of analogs to the blue galactic gcs with @xmath20 but our galex data do not support their claim .",
    "most galex m31 gcs populate @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where we expect to find relatively uv bright clusters with bluer hb morphology .",
    "we surmise that the red gcs with @xmath23 must have redder hb morphologies and are relatively uv faint , since these red clusters are probably metal - rich and uv@xmath18 colors are very sensitive to metallicity .    among their uit sample , bohlin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) report blue clusters with @xmath24 , which are much bluer than most m31 and galactic gcs .",
    "they suggest that these clusters are not old gcs but instead are young clusters ( see also burstein et al . 1984 ; bohlin et al .",
    "1988 ; cowley & burstein 1988 ) . b00 also note that their gc catalog may be contaminated by other young objects with @xmath25 and exclude 49 such objects from their analyses .",
    "eight blue clusters of bohlin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) are included in our list of confirmed gcs ( _ filled circles _ ) . since @xmath14 for these clusters is not available in b00 , we assume that they are only affected by the foreground galactic reddening of @xmath26 ( crampton et al . 1985 ) .",
    "the arrows indicate reddening vectors by an increase of @xmath26 . in our photometry , these clusters have bluer uv colors of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are consistent with the color limits of blue clusters suggested by bohlin et al .",
    "we will discuss the properties of these blue clusters in our forthcoming paper .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of our uv@xmath18 colors versus [ fe / h ] , as an analog of the hb type versus [ fe / h ] diagram ( lee et al .",
    "1994 ; as such , bluer colors are now on the right ) , for m31 and galactic gcs .",
    "the range in the uv@xmath18 colors ( compared to @xmath9 ) is striking .",
    "while the m31 gcs extend over a wide range of @xmath29 color , the fuv sample is biased to the blue and metal - poor gcs with no redder [ @xmath30 clusters due to their faint @xmath12 magnitudes .",
    "we also superpose our three model isochrones for different ages ( @xmath31 = -2 , 0 , and + 2 gyr ) , which are constructed from our evolutionary population synthesis models of gcs in the galex filter system ( see also lee , lee , & gibson 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 = 0 gyr line ( _ solid line _ ) corresponds to inner halo galactic gcs ( galactocentric radius @xmath32 8 kpc ) at 12 gyr . the @xmath31 = + 2 gyr ( _ long dashed line _ ) and -2 gyr ( _ short dashed line _ ) lines are for the models 2 gyr older and younger than the galactic gcs , respectively .",
    "these models include the treatment of the detailed systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity and the contribution from pagb stars .",
    "the models fit well the range in color of the clusters and their general locus on the age - metallicity plot .",
    "we find no metal - rich clusters with significant fuv flux , as is present in the two peculiar galactic gcs , ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 ( rich et al .",
    "these two clusters have hot hb stars that are seen in no other galactic gcs of comparable metallicity ( e.g. , 47 tuc ) that have only red hbs .",
    "the arrows represent the upper limit of the metal - rich clusters that were detected in nuv .",
    "there is a hint of dispersion at high metallicity in the @xmath29 versus [ fe / h ] plot ; if confirmed , this may reflect a milder version of the second parameter at high metallicity .",
    "many m31 gcs are resolved by hst , and for those we get hb morphology directly , which makes possible a comparison of the integrated properties of gcs with their actual resolved stellar populations .",
    "in order to see the uv flux variation with different metallicity and hb morphologies of gcs , we plot three different groups of gcs with known hb morphology from previous hst observations ( ajhar et al .",
    "1996 ; fusi pecci et al . 1996 ; rich et al . 1996 ; holland , fahlman , & richer 1997 ; rich 2003 ) : metal - poor blue hb ( bhb ) gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath33 -1.9 ( _ filled circles _ ; g64 and g351 ) , intermediate metallicity red hb ( rhb ) gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath33 -1.1 ( _ filled squares _ ; g1 and g322 ) , and metal - rich red clump gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath33 -0.6 ( filled triangles ; g58 , g319 , and g312 ) . the sensitivity of metallicity and hb morphology to the uv flux is evident in both uv bands , i.e. , the metal - poor bhb clusters show bluer uv@xmath18 colors than the metal - rich red clump clusters , confirming the effect of the hb morphology on the uv@xmath18 colors",
    ".    we also plot m2 and m72 , obtained from the galex all - sky imaging survey observations .",
    "the exposure times were 129 and 112 sec for m2 and m72 , respectively .",
    "the integrated @xmath11 and @xmath12 magnitudes were measured from the concentric large apetures ( 300@xmath34 and 120@xmath34 radius for m2 and m72 , respectively ) containing the total uv light of gcs .",
    "the error bar shows the magnitude variation due to the different aperture size ( 20 % variation of aperture radius ) .",
    "although m2 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath33 -1.58 ; _ pentagon _ ) and m72 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath33 -1.54 ; _ hexagon _ ) have similar metallicities ( lee et al .",
    "1994 ) , they have different hb morphologies , in the sense that m2 has bluer hb morphology .",
    "they show significantly different @xmath35 colors [ @xmath36 that are consistent with their different hb morphologies .    in the plot of @xmath29 color against [ fe / h ] , m31 and galactic gc data appear to follow the trend indicated by the isochrones , a general correlation between @xmath29 color and metallicity . on the other hand , comparison of the @xmath35 color with the models",
    "suggests the promise of gleaning age information ( yi 2003 ) , provided that other sources of a small part of the scatter in fig . 4 ( e.g. , extreme hb , pagb stars , and low mass x - ray binaries ; king et al .",
    "1993 ) can be quantified . in the @xmath35 color versus",
    "[ fe / h ] diagram , m31 and galactic gcs are well located in the age range ( @xmath37 gyr ) of model predictions and show no significantly different age distribution between two gc systems , indicating that the m31 and galactic gc systems show similar mean age and age spread , at least , for the oldest gcs .",
    "this is consistent with claims for age spread in the galactic and m31 gcs ( rosenberg et al .",
