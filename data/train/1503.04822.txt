    "we now prove a threshold for successful purification for the 5-qubit error correcting code used as an entanglement distillation scheme . instead of giving a lower bound on the fidelity , we give an upper bound on the infidelity , or the probability of measuring @xmath86 , @xmath87 or @xmath86 for a pair of qubits .    for @xmath86",
    "we have @xmath88 = \\frac{{\\operatorname{tr}\\left[b e^{l-1}\\right]}}{{\\operatorname{tr}\\left[e^l\\right ] } } , \\ ] ] where the @xmath69 acts on all other pairs of qubits .",
    "similar expressions hold for @xmath87 and @xmath89 by replacing @xmath90 with @xmath1 or @xmath91 , respectively",
    ". we will find an upper bound of this expression in terms of the channel norm of the associated observable transfer matrices @xmath90 , @xmath1 , and @xmath91 .",
    "we assume locally purifiable mpo s which allows us to make use of an isomorphism between the mpo matrices and completely positive maps .",
    "specifically , we define a norm @xmath32 in terms of a channel @xmath33 choi - isomorphic to @xmath18 , so that @xmath34 and we use the induced `` 1-to-1 '' schatten norm .",

    "we call @xmath92 the channel choi - isomorphic to the transfer matrix @xmath93 . our lemma [ lem : normbound ] of the appendices proves that , assuming @xmath94 is trace - preserving , we have @xmath95   \\leq { { \\| \\mathcal{b } \\|_{1{\\rightarrow}1 } } } \\frac{1+d^{5/2}{\\tau{\\left({\\mathcal{e}}\\right)}}^{l-1}}{1-d^{5/2}{\\tau{\\left({\\mathcal{e}}\\right)}}^{l}}.\\ ] ] proving convergence of the initial mpo in the state @xmath30 to the maximally entangled state @xmath16 is achieved by showing that the noise matrices vanish exponentially faster than the @xmath31 matrices .",
    "one step of the protocol takes 5 pairs as input and returns one pair as output , correcting all zero and one qubit errors and thus reducing the error probability to at least quadratic order in @xmath96 . as discussed before",
    ", the code applies without post - selection , which means that the state does not have to be renormalised . as the length of the chain @xmath97",
    "is divided by five in every step , the new transfer matrix @xmath98 is simply the fifth power of the previous transfer matrix @xmath99 .",
    "so if we start with a trace - preserving transfer channel , it remains trace - preserving .",
    "thus , the renormalisation factor , derived in lemma [ lem : tracebound ] is constant , @xmath100 and @xmath101 by sub - multiplicativity of the ergodicity , we have @xmath102 this already gives us an upper bound for the normalization for every step in the iteration just from the initial length of the chain and ergodicity .",
    "the second step is to upper bound @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we introduced , as a measure of the noise , the quantity @xmath106 defined in a gauge and scaling , where @xmath107 is trace - preserving .",
    "this gauge and scaling stays constant over the iteration .",
    "the complete update rules can be derived following the methodology of sec .",
    "[ secrecc ] .",
    "we obtain a closed form for the map acting on the coefficient matrices in each iteration , though we omit it here as each expression contains @xmath74 terms and is not very insightful .",
    "rather , we present just the leading terms here , @xmath108 furthermore , we do not need the explicit iteration rule but only the norm of it .",
    "each term is a product consisting of @xmath80 and some noise matrices .",
    "we can upper bound the channel norm by using sub - multiplicativity and sub - additivity and the definition of our noise measure , @xmath109 the norm of @xmath80 can be easily upper bounded using the properties of channels and channel norms @xmath110 .",
    "the ensuing iteration for the noise measure is thus @xmath111 clearly , for errors to reduce @xmath82 must be at least smaller than @xmath112 . in this regime , we have @xmath113 so we can be sure the iteration converges if @xmath114 . numerically , we find that @xmath115 .",
    "the speed of the convergence is double exponential in the number of rounds , @xmath116 making use of eq .",
    "( [ fidbound ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ enevolve ] ) , we find that infidelity is bounded by @xmath117 since @xmath118 , we have in generic cases that in the limit of an infinite chain @xmath119 and it converges whenever @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , which ends the proof .    it has hence been shown that we can formulate a threshold depending on the 1-to-1-norm of the three noise channels .",
    "this concludes our proof of a threshold for the five - qubit error correcting code .",
    "we now turn to the post - selected recurrence protocol .",
    "it turns out that the proof is significantly more sophisticated since we can not rely on the trace - preserving property of the transfer channel .",
    "this requires a refined approach that involves deriving a perturbation bound for the left perron vector of a quantum channel , using ideas of markov chain mixing .",
    "the recurrence protocol can be broken up into two steps performed locally by alice and also bob .",
    "so alice ( and also bob ) divide their qubits up into adjacent pairs within the mpo chain . for each pair",
    "the isometry @xmath123 is applied .",
    "this can be implemented using a local cnot , measurement , post - selection and disposing of the measured qubit .",
    "the second step consists of a hadamard rotation , again by both alice and bob .",
    "it is easy to verify that after the first step we again get an mpo with the same bond dimension ( see fig.[fig : mpo ] ) such that @xmath124 where the @xmath125 is the mpo operator in elements of the computational basis of 2 qubits , and so @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , this is direct analogous to the i.i.d case where the density matrix elements map as @xmath127 , though of course only in the computational basis .",
    "the phase noise is dealt with by the second step .",
    "the bilateral hadamard operation effectively swaps bit and phase flip noise so that both are dealt with . in the computational basis",
    "the bilateral hadamard operation is unwieldily so we switch to the bell basis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mpo2 ] ) . for the bell basis",
    "we use the following shorthand @xmath128 which only defines the mpo operators for the diagonal elements in the bell - basis , but we will see that they are decoupled from other elements and so it is sufficient to consider these alone . in this basis",
    "the recurrence procedure implements @xmath129 where each of the two steps are shown , and a subscript @xmath25 is introduced to denote the mpo after @xmath25 iterations .",
    "the brackets @xmath130 denote the anti - commutator . for matrices",
    "that are simply scalars , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 , we see @xmath133 but @xmath134 .",
    "this occurs because in a single round only one type of noise is decreased , and so to see an overall @xmath135 error reduction we must consider two rounds of iteration @xmath136 now treating the matrices as scalars , we see @xmath137 all go from size @xmath138 to @xmath139 or smaller .",
    "this is the intuition from the i.i.d .",
    "case and we next turn to making this rigorous by quantifying this size with appropriate matrix norms .      in the main text we presented a sketch of the proof of theorem  [ thm : recurrence ] .",
    "we first recap this sketch , filling in some details , and clearly stating required lemmas .",
    "numerous technical tools relating to norms and the ergodicity coefficient are covered in sec .",
    "[ norms ] .",

    "<S> [ thm : recurrence ] given a translationally invariant bell diagonal mpo with coefficient matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the iterative application of the recurrence protocol leads to convergence to uncorrelated pairs in the maximally entangled state @xmath47 for @xmath48    the convergence is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : taueps ] . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is presented in full length in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> to be self - contained , we will sketch it here , and provide significant intuition .    to prove convergence , we need to show that the noise matrices go down exponentially fast , while @xmath31 stays large . </S>",
    "<S> the first part can be shown by taking into account a double step of the protocol after which all norms of the noise matrices are at least of order @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be shown via sub - additivity and sub - multiplicativity of the 1-to-1 norm , @xmath50 however , to ensure the contribution of the dominant matrix stays large , our approach is to regauge so that @xmath51 is trace - preserving . </S>",
    "<S> a channel @xmath52 is trace - preserving if and only if its hilbert - schmidt adjoint , the dual channel @xmath53 ( the heisenberg representation of @xmath52 ) satisfies @xmath54 . when instead @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the largest such eigenvalue ) , then the perron  </S>",
    "<S> frobenius theorem ensures @xmath57 is hermitian . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge transformation @xmath58 and the re - scaling by @xmath59 will recover trace - preservation , provided @xmath57 is invertible . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation potentially increases the norm of the noise matrices . using sub - multiplicativity , we find that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the condition number of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to show that @xmath63 stays close to trace - preserving to keep the condition number small . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath64 the proof bears similarities to the perturbation of the steady state of a trace - preserving _ quantum markov chain _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which also depends on the ergodicity coefficient of the transition matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the basic intuition is that if @xmath52 is a rapidly mixing channel , with small @xmath65 , then @xmath66 is also rapidly mixing . before making </S>",
    "<S> our gauge transformation @xmath39 is a sum of @xmath67 and some small noise matrices . the more rapidly mixing a channel , the more its eigenstates are robust against the perturbative addition of noise matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we desire the dual eigenstate @xmath68 before the gauge to stay close to @xmath69 , which we expect provided for rapid mixing ( small @xmath65 ) and low noise ( small @xmath70 ) as we show rigorously in a spirit similar to the ideas of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .      for every error correcting code that encodes @xmath71 qubits into @xmath22 physical qubits </S>",
    "<S> , there exists an iterative @xmath72 one - way entanglement distillation protocol  @xcite . in these protocols , </S>",
    "<S> noise information is extracted by local measurements , but instead of post - selecting when errors are detected we attempt to correct them by determining the smallest weight error consistent with the measurement data . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage over the recurrence protocol is that this protocol is deterministic , and that one - way distillation schemes require much less classical communication . in particular , we consider one - way entanglement distillation using the 5-qubit code ( so a @xmath73 protocol ) , which is the smallest known code capable of correcting any single qubit error . </S>",
    "<S> we again find a closed form for the map acting on the coefficient matrices in each iteration , though we omit it here as each expression contains @xmath74 terms . </S>",
    "<S> we further introduce the transfer matrix @xmath75with corresponding channel @xmath76 , as it has useful properties over the course of the iterations in a deterministic protocol , and state the following theorem .    given a translationally invariant bell diagonal mpo with coefficient matrices @xmath45 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 , the iterative application of the 5-qubit error correcting code leads to convergence to uncorrelated pairs in the maximally entangled state @xmath47 for @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 is defined as above in the gauge where @xmath79 is trace - preserving .    </S>",
    "<S> again , the full proof is provided in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the post - selective case , we show that with a growing number of iterations @xmath25 , the contribution of the dominant matrix @xmath80 grows exponentially faster than the contribution of the noise matrices . in the deterministic case </S>",
    "<S> , we can use our gauge freedom to make @xmath76 trace - preserving . since we do not post - select </S>",
    "<S> , we do not need to renormalise in every round . in the 5-qubit error correction code , the transfer matrix is always mapped to its fifth power , @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we initially choose a gauge where the corresponding map @xmath79 is trace - preserving , the transfer matrix will keep this property over the course of the iteration . using combinatorical arguments </S>",
    "<S> , we then prove that for suitably small @xmath78 , @xmath82 converges to zero , entailing convergence in fidelity of the physical state .      to complement the rigorous and analytical results presented above , we have also performed numerical studies on randomly drawn matrices . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that a state within the distillable region is guaranteed to converge , but several steps in our proof make worst case assumptions and so we may also find convergence for many mpo states outside this region . in a worst case scenario , </S>",
    "<S> correlations are always pernicious . however , </S>",
    "<S> our numerics indicate that in many strongly correlated chains the correlations can also be beneficial and enable distillation at noise levels well above the rigorous threshold as well as in cases where the protocols do not converge for uncorrelated i.i.d .  states .     </S>",
    "<S> it should be clear that many physical hamiltonians reflecting interactions with memory channels in sequential preparation procedures are covered by our results . to present a paradigmatic example , we compare the performance of the recurrence protocol on ( i ) perfect memoryless i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> distributions of @xmath16 states with ( ii ) sequentially prepared states with implemented memory . for the preparation of the memory , we prepare uncorrelated werner states , which then undergo a unitary interaction @xmath83 on bob s side , where the hamiltonian @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 we further implement a de - phasing channel to make the memory forgetful . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss this example in further detail in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> we identify parameter regions where the correlated states remarkably outperform the uncorrelated i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> states regarding the speed of convergence . also , distillation is possible for a larger range of initial fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to use the unwanted correlations from the memory to enhance the distillation , see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : taueps ] .      in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a framework of renormalising entanglement in order to achieve entanglement distillation in the presence of natural correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we have proven that protocols known to work for i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> pairs above a threshold fidelity also give rise to feasible entanglement distillation . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified criteria to ensure convergence of correlated pairs described by an mpo to a number of independent maximally entangled pure states . </S>",
    "<S> on intuitive grounds , one might expect that if the mpo is only weakly correlated between the pairs and the reduced density matrix of a single pair is sufficiently close to a bell pair , the distillation protocols should behave similarly to the i.i.d .  case . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , convergence can be proven for threshold fidelities and conditions on the correlation between the pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the programme initiated here shows that correlations are not necessarily a disadvantage , and one does not have to aim at de - correlating pairs or resetting preparation procedures , steps that will take time and will in practice lead to further entanglement deterioration . </S>",
    "<S> this work shows that such correlations can be largely renormalised away , with no modification to the schemes applied . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this work triggers further studies on entanglement distillation and repeater protocols in the presence of realistic memory effects , as well as of further studies of renormalising matrix - product operators .      </S>",
