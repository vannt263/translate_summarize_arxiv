    "the use of metallic ferromagnetic contacts has been questioned for achieving considerable spin - polarized currents in combination with semiconductors , because of the different conductivities of metals and semiconductors @xcite . in order to achieve considerable spin - polarized currents in the semiconductor almost 100% intrinsic spinpolarization in the metallic ferromagnet",
    "is required , however at best 80% spinpolarization was achieved @xcite .",
    "therefore different other materials are examined experimentally as well as theoretically , as for example ferromagnetic semiconductors such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a very efficient spininjection experiment was performed by fiederling et al .",
    "@xcite in which a spin - polarized current was injected into a light emitting diode ( led ) structure through a beryllium zinc manganese selenide ( beznmnse)-contact . the degree of spinpolarization was determined by the measurement of the degree of the circular polarization of the emitted light .",
    "the efficiency of the spininjection was determined to be 90% .",
    "this is due to the large zeeman splitting of the conduction band in an applied magnetic field in this paramagnetic diluted magnetic semiconductor .",

    "the transmission probability @xmath5 in general represents a parameter to introduce an imbalance to the edge channels of the two dimensional electron system . in our case",
    "the aim is to achieve almost 100% spinpolarization in the znmnse - contacts .",
    "the introduced barrier and the corresponding transmission probability @xmath5 is a measure for the deviation from the fully spin - polarized case and reflects in our model the probability of the fully spin - polarized electrons in the majority level to be thermally activated to the minority spin level .",
    "this is described in more detail in section v.",

    "the influence of electron scattering between two neighboring edge channels , i.e. an equilibration of electrons between differently populated spin - split levels can be treated within the landauer - bttiker formalism by introducing a probability @xmath42 that an electron will remain in the same edge channel on the way between two neighboring contacts , separated by a distance @xmath43 . to obtain",

    "these values for the equilibration lengths are also supported by theoretical findings reported in ref .  , where the spin - flip process is mediated by spin - orbit interaction .",

    "the hall resistance decays exponentially with the distance @xmath43 of the znmnse - contacts from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , reflecting the equilibration of the two spin - split edge channels .",
    "the non - vanishing longitudinal resistance for complete spininjection ( @xmath39 ) with distance @xmath43 can be explained by the scattering of electrons between neighboring edge channels .",
    "electrons can be scattered from edge channel 1 into edge channel 2 and can therefore be backscattered , leading to a non - vanishing longitudinal resistance . for longer distances @xmath43 between the contacts complete equilibration of electrons is reached and the longitudinal resistance again vanishes .",
    "in order to describe the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistance of the system depicted in fig . 1 , equation ( 12 ) has to be extended to different filling factors @xmath6 . for this purpose",
    "the transmission- and reflection probabilities of equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , respectively , have to be re - calculated .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath5 of the znmnse - contacts does depend on the magnetic field .",
    "the aim is to achieve almost 100% spinpolarization in the znmnse - contacts , i.e. the minority spin level is above the fermi level in the contacts .",
    "this can be achieved by suitable doping of the znmnse - contacts . in this doping regime",
    "the majority and minority spin levels can be treated as a two level system , separated by approximately the zeeman energy @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is the effective g - factor which is described in refs .   and :",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the manganese content of the zn@xmath0mn@xmath1se - contacts is @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are phenomenological parameters , which depend on the mn - content @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath69 accounts for the fact that a fraction of the mn@xmath71-ions in the znmnse lattice will build pairs or even larger clusters which interact antiferromagnetically and thus decrease the effective magnetic moment .",
    "this fraction of mn@xmath71-ions increases with increasing mn - content in the znmnse - contacts .",
    "the remaining ions which are not in pairs or clusters are aligned to an external magnetic field according to a brillouin function @xmath72 with a temperature @xmath73 in the exponent which is higher than the actual sample temperature @xmath74 .",
    "the reason for this is a long range antiferromagnetic interaction between these ions which also increases with increasing mn concentration in the znmnse - contacts @xcite .",
    "considering the two level system of the majority and minority spin levels , where the minority spin level lies above the fermi level , the minority spin level can be thermally activated . using a boltzman approximation , where the ratio of the minority and the majority spin population is given by @xmath75 ,",
    "the transmission probability @xmath5 , which reflects the deviation from the full spinpolarization of the znmnse - contacts , can be written as @xmath76 the transmission probability @xmath5 of the minority spin through the znmnse - contact drops down to @xmath77 at a magnetic field of @xmath78 at 100mk for a manganese content of @xmath79 .",
    "this high degree of spinpolarization even at small magnetic fields is consistent with the experiments of ref .   and and",
    "may be explained by conduction in an impurity band , which is split by the zeeman energy into a two level system of spin up and spin down electrons in an applied magnetic field as discussed above .",
    "that is the reason for the high degree of spinpolarization in znmnse already at small magnetic fields .",
    "since it is possible to achieve full spinpolarization at a magnetic field of @xmath78 for suitable doping of the znmnse - contacts and @xmath5 is essentially zero for @xmath80 we assume @xmath39 for these magnetic fields in the following simulation , i.e. 100% spinpolarization of the znmnse - contacts .",
    "spin - flip scattering at the interface between znmnse and the 2deg and also on the way between the znmnse contact and the 2deg is neglected .",
    "the latter is justified , since long spin decoherence lengths have been found in gaas @xcite . when simulating the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistance @xmath28 one has to compute the filling factor @xmath6 of the 2deg for the applied magnetic field @xmath81 using @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the charge carrier density in the 2deg .",
    "the knowledge about the filling factor , i.e. knowing the number of edge channels , enables us to compute the transmission and reflection probabilities for different magnetic fields according to equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . from equation",
    "( 1 ) the hall resistance @xmath28 can now be deduced . in this model only scattering between neighboring spin - split edge channels is considered , neglecting scattering between different landau levels .",
    "this is justified since the zeeman - splitting in the gaas is much smaller than the landau splitting and thus the overlap of the wave functions of the spin - split levels is larger than that of the landau levels @xcite .",
    "we also neglect possible spin - flip scattering events at the interface between the znmnse - contacts and the 2deg . in our simulation of the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistance for a contact geometry according to fig .",
    "1 we use an equilibration length of @xmath84 which is a typical value reported in ref .  .",
    "in our model we assume this equilibration length to be the same for all filling factors , which is certainly not true since the overlap of the wave functions of spin - split levels increases with decreasing magnetic field , i.e. with increasing filling factors .",
    "this is due to the reduction of the zeeman - splitting in the gaas with decreasing magnetic field .",
    "we use this assumption , which is quite good for small filling factors , because of the lack of the knowledge of the equilibration length for filling factors higher than two .",
    "the temperature of the sample is considered to be @xmath85 , the charge carrier density is assumed to be @xmath86 and the mn - concentration of the znmnse - contacts is set to @xmath79 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the hall resistance @xmath28 is displayed versus the magnetic field for different distances @xmath43 between the znmnse - contacts . in the landauer - bttiker formalism",
    "the hall resistance arises from counting the current carrying spin - split landau levels , i.e. the current carrying spin - split edge channels at the fermi level in the 2deg .",
    "each of these edge channels contributes @xmath87 to the hall resistance .     as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath81 for different distances @xmath43 between the znmnse - contacts for an equilibration length of @xmath88 . with",
    "increasing distance @xmath43 of the znmnse - contacts the hall resistance @xmath28 decays exponentially to approach the value of the hall resistance for not spin - polarized contacts ( thin solid line ) .",
    "the reason that the hall resistance for odd filling factors does not decay to the value for the case of not spin - polarized contacts is the opposite sign of the g - factor in znmnse and gaas and the fact that the presented model does not include inter landau level scattering ( see text).,width=264 ]    the case of no spininjection is also displayed in fig . 4 for comparison ( thin solid line ) . without equilibration of electrons between the spin - split levels ( @xmath89 , bold solid line ) , the hall resistance would be higher than in the case of no spininjection . for a filling factor of @xmath2",
    "the hall resistance for no equilibration of spins ( @xmath40 ) is twice as high as in the case of no spininjection ( @xmath37 ) . with increasing distance @xmath43 between the znmnse - contacts",
    "the hall resistance decreases and exponentially approaches the value of the hall resistance for no spininjection in the case of even filling factors @xmath6 . for complete spininjection for @xmath2",
    "there is just one current carrying edge channel at the fermi level , namely the channel for the majority spin . with increasing distance @xmath43 of the znmnse - contacts ,",
    "spin - flip processes lead to a population of the second edge channel , i.e. the edge channel corresponding to the minority spin - type .",
    "therefore one ends up with two current carrying edge channels at the fermi level in the 2deg . for a filling factor of @xmath90 the electrons in the gaas",
    "have an opposite spin compared to the majority electrons in the znmnse - contact , because of the opposite sign of the g - factor of gaas and znmnse .",
    "therefore we expect no current injection from the znmnse - contact into the @xmath90 level of the 2deg and no hall voltage is expected to be measured for 100% spininjection .",
    "this effect is destroyed for not 100% spininjection ( @xmath91 ) . for odd filling factors",
    "@xmath6 the hall resistance in our model does not decay to the value of the case of no spininjection .",
    "this is also due to the opposite sign of the g - factor in znmnse and gaas . in the case of filling factor @xmath92 , for example ,",
    "two landau levels have an opposite spin compared to the majority electrons in the znmnse - contact .",
    "there is effectively just one level in the 2deg for the majority spin in the znmnse - contact and a second , spin - split level to which electrons can be equilibrated , when neglecting scattering between different landau levels .",
    "this means that there is just one current carrying channel for no equilibration and two of these channels , which contribute to ballistic transport , with different population for finite equilibration between spin - split levels .",
    "this is the reason why the hall plateau corresponding to filling factor @xmath92 is at the same level as the hall plateau for @xmath2 .",
    "if scattering between landau levels was included , the hall resistance would again decay to the value of the case of no spininjection , however , according to a probably longer equilibration length for this process , on a different length scale . a deviation from the case of full spininjection ( @xmath91 ) will cause the hall plateaus corresponding to different landau levels of opposite spin , for example @xmath92 and @xmath2 , not to align perfectly .",
    "the deviation will depend on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "+ an important point to note here is that spin accumulation effects and band bending are not considered in the presented model .",
    "these effects lead to a filling of the minority spin level in the znmnse - contacts and thus to an increase in the transmission probability @xmath5 for the minority spin - type .",
    "these effects are considered to be more pronounced at higher bias voltages . in our model",
    "we are in a regime with low bias , because a quasi equilibrium quantum hall measurement is assumed .",
    "nevertheless a small increase in @xmath5 might lead to a coupling of the minority spin - type in the znmnse - contacts to the @xmath90 level of the 2deg and a hall voltage of @xmath40 becomes measurable . furthermore",
    "the hall plateaus corresponding to different landau levels of opposite spin will not perfectly align anymore for @xmath91 ( see above ) .",
    "however , the filling of the minority spin level by spin accumulation and band bending can be prevented or kept small , by keeping the intrinsic spinpolarization of the znmnse - contacts high .",
    "this can be done by introducing a sufficiently high mn - concentration to the znmnse - contacts .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an experiment to probe spin - polarized currents in the quantum hall regime of znmnse - contacts coupled to a 2deg , where we expect a hall resistance twice as high as for conventional non spinaligning contacts for a filling factor of @xmath2 .",
    "znmnse - contacts are chosen , because of their large zeeman - splitting and therefore large internal spinpolarization in an applied magnetic field .",
    "furthermore the influence of the equilibration length between spin - split levels in the 2deg was discussed , with the conclusion that the distance of the contacts has to be considerably smaller than a minimal equilibration length of @xmath93 at temperatures below @xmath94 in order to observe the proposed effect . in our model coupling of the majority spin in the znmnse - contact to odd filling factors in the 2deg",
    "is strongly suppressed for full spininjection , because of the opposite sign of the g - factors of znmnse and gaas .",
    "the described model can also be applied to other spin - polarizing contacts , for example gamnas . since",
    "this ferromagnetic semiconductor is p - type , one has to inject spin - polarized holes into a two dimensional hole gas . in order to be applicable , our model has to be adjusted for equilibration lengths in a two dimensional hole gas .",
