    "the warkworth radio astronomical observatory for which a panorama photo is shown in figure [ fig : warkworth ] is located some 60 km north of the city of auckland , near the township of warkworth .",
    "specifications of the warkworth 12-m and 30-m antennas are provided in table [ t : wark ] .",
    "the 12-m radio telescope is equipped with an s / x dual - band dual - circular polarization feed at the secondary focus and an l - band feed at the prime focus .",
    "backend data digitizing is handled by a digital base band converter ( dbbc ) manufactured by the hat - lab , catania , italy .",
    "the 30-m radio telescope is currently equipped with a un - cooled c band dual - circular polarization receiver .",
    "the station frequency standard is a symmetricom active hydrogen maser mhm-2010 ( 75001 - 114 ) .",
    "mark 5b+ and mark 5c data recorders are used for data storage and streaming of recorded data off site .",
    "the observatory network is directly connected to the national network provided by research and education advanced network new zealand ltd ( reannz ) via a 10  gbps fibre link to the site @xcite .",
    "foundations have been laid for the future hosting of a gravimeter when in transit here in new zealand from antarctica .",
    "the site is just outside the 12-m antenna control facility so as to easily access utilities , and is also close to one of the linz ( land information new zealand ) gnss station hosted at the warkworth observatory . in march 2015 a site survey of the observatory",
    "will be undertaken with the assistance of linz .",
    "this will provide a useful check o fthe initial local tie survey of the 12-m antenna and gnss station conducted at the end of 2012 @xcite , and also provide a tie to the 30-m radio telescope for the first time .",
