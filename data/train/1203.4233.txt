    "many x - ray sources ( xrss ) are inside globular clusters ( gcs ; e.g. heinke 2011 ) , but only five of them unambiguosly host a black hole ( bh ; maccarone et al .",

    "2010 , hereafter i10 ; see king 2011 for an alternative explanation ) .",
    "these five objects were observed as luminous xrss ( @xmath6 ) with strong variability ( so that blending is excluded ; kalogera et al .",
    "the spectra of at least two of their host gcs are quite peculiar .",
    "one of them , rz  2109 ( in the elliptical ngc  4472 ; zepf et al . 2007 , 2008 , and steele et al .",
    "2011 ; hereafter z07 , z08 , s11 ) displays prominent and broad [ oiii]@xmath75007,4959 emission ( the fwhm of [ oiii]@xmath8 is @xmath9@xmath10 ; its flux is @xmath11 ; at @xmath12 it corresponds to @xmath13 ; see z08 ) , but no h line emission@xmath14 , [ nii]@xmath15 , [ sii]@xmath16 ) is detected , except perhaps [ oiii]@xmath17 . ] . the spectrum of the gc hosting the xrs cxoj033831.8 - 352604 ( in the elliptical ngc  1399 ; see i10 ) is somewhat similar in the absence of h and the presence of [ oiii ] lines ; but widths and luminosities are lower ( fwhm @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , and [ nii ] @xmath76583,6548 emission is comparable to [ oiii ] .",
    "these observations are hard to explain , because of the high [ oiii]/h@xmath20 ratio ( z08 estimate @xmath21 ; i10 finds a 3@xmath22 lower limit of 5 ; both are very uncertain ) and of the large broadening , implying motions much faster than gc velocity dispersions ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "optical lines are too wide for a planetary nebula , and too narrow for a supernova remnant .",
    "z08 suggest that the [ oiii ] emission from rz  2109 might come from a strong wind originating around the bh , photoionized by the xrs .",
    "such scenario strongly favours a bh with mass @xmath24 , rather than an intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) with mass in the 10@xmath25 - 10@xmath26m@xmath27 range .",
    "this was preferred to the hypothesis that the [ oiii]-emitting gas closely orbits ( @xmath28 ) an imbh , on the basis of considerations about the maximum possible emission from such a small volume .",
    "such argument is severely weakened if the orbiting gas is very metal - rich , e.g. as the result of the tidal disruption of a white dwarf ( wd ) by an imbh ( see i10 ) : according to porter ( 2010 ) , the cxoj033831.8 - 352604 data are compatible with this scenario , whereas in the case of rz  2109 the conflict remains ; however , clausen & eracleous ( 2011 ) showed that simulations of wd disruption can reproduce the [ oiii ] line profiles observed in rz  2109 . on the other hand ,",
    "maccarone & warner ( 2011 ) argued that the line emission of cxoj033831.8 - 352604 might be better explained with the photoionization ( by the xrs ) of the wind from an r coronae borealis star in the same gc .    in this paper",
    ", we examine a further possible scenario , and apply it to the case of rz  2109 : [ oiii ] lines might be associated with a recent nova eruption in the core of the gc .",
    "in particular , we discuss the case ( first mentioned by s11 ) where the [ oiii ] emission comes from the photoionization of the nova ejecta by the xrs .",
    "x - ray emission from novae is typically fainter ( @xmath29 , even though at least one nova was reported to reach @xmath30 - see henze et al .",
    "2010 ) and shorter ( decay times @xmath31 ) than what is observed for these sources .",
    "thus , we assume that the nova eruption is _ not _ associated to the xrs , i.e. that the co - existence of the two phenomena in the same gc is serendipitous .",
    "nova eruptions occur in binary systems where a wd accretes from a normal star ( e.g. gehrz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "nuclear reactions ignite explosively in the material accumulated on the wd surface , leading to a brief super - eddington phase during which the wd outer layers are ejected ( e.g. starrfield et al .",
    "1972 , prialnik 1986 ) .",
    "ejecta velocities are in the 1002500@xmath32 range , and their metal mass fractions can be as high as @xmath33 ( yaron et al .",
    "2005 , shara et al .",
    "2010 ; hereafter y05 , s10 ) .",
    "typical ejecta masses are in the @xmath34@xmath35 range ; but y05 and s10 showed that nova eruptions on slowly - accreting , low - temperature wds can eject up to @xmath36 of gas .",
    "ejecta mass estimates in x - ray detected novae ( pietsch et al . 2007 ) somewhat confirm theoretical expectations : ejecta masses of @xmath37 are likely in at least 2 out of 18 novae .",
    "wd - hosting binaries are common in gcs ( sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) ; thus , novae should be frequent in gcs .",
    "this disagrees with the low number of novae observed in gcs ; but the discrepancy might be explained by observational biases .",
    "we parametrize the nova rate in a gc as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the nova rate per unit stellar mass in elliptical galaxies ( della valle et al . 1994 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2005 ; henze et al .",
    "2009 ) , @xmath40 is the gc mass , and @xmath41 is the enhancement of the nova rate in gcs ( compared to ellipticals ) .",
    "we expect @xmath42 because of the over - abundance of wd - hosting binaries in gcs . on the other hand , observations of the m31 and m87 gc systems",
    "can put upper limits on nova occurrence rates : for m87 , shara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) infer @xmath43 , whereas for m31 we have an upper limit @xmath44 ( henze et al . 2009 ) : assuming @xmath45 , these rates imply @xmath46 .",
    "we use the photoionization code cloudy ( version 08.00 , see ferland et .",
    "al . 1998 ) to model the optical spectrum resulting from the photoionization of the nova ejecta by the xrs .",
    "we represent the nova ejecta as a slab of material with thickness @xmath47 , number density @xmath48 , filling factor @xmath49 , and metallicity @xmath50 , at a distance @xmath51 from the xrs , covering a fraction @xmath52 of the solid angle around it .",
    "we note that @xmath52 determines two different geometrical configurations :    1 .",
    "if @xmath52 is large ( @xmath53 ) , the xrs must be _ within _ the nova ejecta .",
    "in such case , we neglect the offset between the xrs and the centre of the ejecta shell , so that the radius of the ejecta shell is @xmath54 ; then , the time elapsed after the nova explosion is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath52 is small , we assume the xrs to be _ outside _ the ejecta , and estimate @xmath58 from simple geometry : @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 .",
    "the xrs spectrum was taken from m07 : we use a disk blackbody spectrum with @xmath61 and 0.210 kev luminosity @xmath62 .",
    "we note that m07 reported a large variation ( a drop by a factor of @xmath63 ) in the count rate during a single _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "such variation is consistent with an increase in the intervening column density , from @xmath64 ( consistent with the galactic value ) to @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we assume that the intrinsic x - ray spectrum does not change ; but we experiment with different @xmath65 values .",

    "z08 do not quote an error on this measurement : the equivalent width comparison performed by s11 suggests an uncertainty of 2030 per cent ; but the discrepancy with the z07 spectrum suggests a larger amount .",

    "we arbitrarily select four viable models ( see table  2 ) for a study of the time evolution of line emission .",
    "this was done by assuming that the nova shell keeps expanding with @xmath118 ( cfr .",
    "z08 , s11 ) , and properly scaling the relevant parameters ( @xmath119 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 if xrs is outside the expanding shell ; @xmath51 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise ) .",
    "as the evolution of the thickness @xmath47 of the nova shell is unclear , we consider two different cases : ( a ) @xmath120constant ( appropriate for small velocity dispersions within the ejecta ) , and ( b ) @xmath121 ( appropriate for a significant ejecta velocity dispersion ) .",
    "we calculated the properties of each of these four models at five times : three past epochs ( april 2005 , december 2007 , and march 2009 , i.e. the times of the last z07 observation , of the z08 observation , and of the last s11 observation , respectively ) , and two future ones ( december 2012 and december 2017 , i.e. 5 and 10 years after the z08 observation ) .",
    "the behaviour of the results are summarized in fig .  2 , where we show the time evolution of the ionization parameter , of the ionization state of oxygen , and of the intensities of five lines ( or groups of lines ) .",
    "such lines are representative of the main ionization stages and of the most abundant heavy elements in the ejecta , but are _ not _ always the most intense : an exhaustive list of possibly detectable optical and uv lines can be found in the appendix .    in 7 out of 8 models",
    "the ionization parameter increases with time , so that heavy elements ( such as oxygen ) move to higher ionization states .",
    "therefore , high - ionization lines ( such as the ovi lines around @xmath1221035 ) tend to grow stronger , whereas low - ionization lines ( e.g. [ nii]@xmath76548,6583 ) tend to weaken with time , and intermediate - ionization lines ( e.g. the civ doublet at @xmath71549,1551 ) grow to a peak , and then start to decline .    the case ( a ) of model c is the main exception : since it assumes that ( i ) the xrs is within the expanding shell , and ( ii ) the shell thickness is constant , the density evolution in the shell ( @xmath123 ) compensates the geometrical dilution of the ionizing flux , resulting in a constant ionization parameter . as a consequence ,",
    "the ionization state of oxygen ( and of all the other heavy elements ) remains practically constant , and line fluxes tend to decrease very slowly .    the four models were required to agree with the december 2007 observations , so their spectra for this epoch are dominated by the [ oiii ] doublet , with @xmath94 within 20 per cent from the z08 value . in addition ,",
    "[ neiii]@xmath124 and [ oiii]@xmath17 might be strong enough to be detectable : the latter was marginally detected by z08 ; as to [ neiii ] , we note that the z08 spectrum is very noisy at @xmath1254000 , and this line might be confused with other features in that region . all the models",
    "( except model d - see next subsection ) are in quite satisfactory agreement with the 2009 observation , too : this is simply because the 1.3 years interval from december 2007 to march 2009 is a relatively small fraction of @xmath126 .",
    "instead we find larger ( and more interesting ) differences if we look at the april 2005 spectrum : models a and c predict that the [ oiii ] emission was as strong ( a ) or stronger ( c ) than in 2007 , and require that the discrepancy among the fluxes reported by z07 and z08 derives from observational factors only .",
    "instead , models b and d provide a different explanation : their quite short @xmath117 imply large differences in @xmath58 : in 2005 @xmath58 was only 2/3 ( model b ) or 1/3 ( model d ) of its value in 2007 ; such a difference not only reduces the amount of energy intercepted by the ejecta , but at the same time lowers the ionization parameter , favouring low - ionization states and moving the emission from [ oiii ] to [ oii ] ( or even [ oi ] ) lines .",
    "the predictions for 2012 and 2017 offer an opportunity to test these models , with model d predicting that all anomalous emission lines should disappear before 2012 , model b predicting large declines , and models a and c predicting a slower , steady decline . as we already mentioned , such decline",
    "is mostly understood in terms of an increasing ionization parameter , so that the o@xmath127 abundance drops .",
    "it should be noted that all the above predictions suffer from a number of approximations :    1 .",
    "the structure of a nova shell is not uniform .",
    "there are large density fluctuations both at early times ( @xmath128 years after the eruption ; see e.g. the images of nova cygni 1992 in chochol et al .",
    "1997 ) and at late times ( @xmath129 years after the eruption ; see e.g. the images of t pyx in shara et al .",
    "2 .   the residual nuclear burning on the wd responsible for the nova eruption might produce a significant amount of uv / x - ray photons for a few years ( see henze et al .",
    "2010 ) : furthermore , when @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and even moderate wd luminosities ( say @xmath132 ) are enough for the wd emission to dominate over the one from the xrs",
    ". therefore , the predictions for model b in 2005 , for model d in 2007 , and especially for model d in 2005 might suffer from the fact that our models do not consider the wd emission .",
    "the cloudy calculations assume steady state , but models with a long ( @xmath1331 yr ) recombination timescale would require a time - dependent approach . for h recombination , @xmath134 ( where @xmath135 is the h recombination coefficient ) , so that models with @xmath136 might suffer from this problem ; however , the recombination timescales of highly ionized metals are shorter ( by factors of 210 ) than @xmath137 , and predictions about their lines should be reliable for @xmath138 .",
    "our geometry is extremely simple , and might suffer from assuming that the whole nova shell is at the same distance from the xrs : this is reasonable if the xrs is within the shell ( model c ) , or if @xmath139 , but there are a number of cases ( models a and b at the 2012 and 2017 epochs ; model d at all epochs except 2005 ) where @xmath140 ( so that the ionization parameter in the xrs - approaching part of the shell might be @xmath141 times higher than in the xrs - receding part ) , and the xrs is engulfed by the shell ; we try to adapt to the new situation by switching to a model with the xrs at the centre of the shell ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , but these two set of predictions should be considered extremely uncertain . ] .",
    "the timing of the evolution depends upon the exact value of @xmath144 : the adopted 1.5 value is reasonable ( s11 estimates @xmath145 for the broad component of the line profile - see the next subsection ) , but not unique : a lower(higher ) choice of @xmath146 would delay(fasten ) the predicted evolution ( for example , if @xmath147 , our predictions for december 2012 and december 2017 would apply to june 2015 and december 2022 , respectively ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant for model d : the [ oiii ] flux if fig .  2 and table  a4 evolves too rapidly ( the 2007 flux agrees with the observations , but both the 2005 and the 2009 fluxes are too low ) ; however",
    ", the model should not be discarded ( yet ) because these discrepancies can still be reconciled using a value of @xmath144 ( @xmath148 ) that is still in agreement with the s11 measurements .",
    "some of these issues might be resolved by adopting more complicated modelling ( e.g. assume a spectrum / temporal evolution for the wd emission , use some density distribution , adopt a more realistic geometry , etc . ) ; however , a more detailed modelling , while providing more reliable predictions , would also require us to introduce a number of additional parameters .",
    "this is not only a problem in terms of resources ( such as computing power ) , but would further complicate the interpretation of the results .",
    "s11 model the spectral profile of the [ oiii]@xmath149 complex as the superposition of the identical profiles of the two lines of the doublet , each one made of a central , relatively narrow ( fwhm@xmath150 ) gaussian peak , plus a much broader ( fwhm@xmath151 ) ` flat ' component ( possibly the result of a bipolar outflow ) ; notably , the latter component is not really flat : the red side is about 1.4 times brighter than the blue side . as noted by s11 ,",
    "this is consistent with a nova shell between the xrs and the observer ) isotropic component , plus a fast bipolar one ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "nova observations ( e.g. iijima & naito 2011 ) and theoretical models ( see e.g. the ejecta velocity plots in s10 ) support these hypotheses by finding / predicting complex profiles for nova emission lines . ] .",
    "if this is the case , the flux difference among the two sides suggests that in 2007 - 2008 @xmath58 was of the order of 10 per cent of the distance between the nova and the xrs : this would favor models with @xmath153 0.01 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath58 increases with time , the asymmetry between the red and blue sides should increase as well ( at least as long as the xrs is outside the nova shell ) .",
    "if the nova lies between us and the xrs , the ejecta might even intercept the line of sight to the xrs , increasing the value of @xmath65 .",
    "we checked whether such an increase can explain the fading of the xrs seen in the 2004 _ xmm _ observation ( see m2007 ) , and in the subsequent _ swift _ and _ chandra _ observations ( see maccarone et al .",
    "the effective x - ray extinction due to isotropic nova ejecta is @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a geometrical factor accounting for the number of times that the photons cross the shell ( 1 if the xrs is within the shell ; 2 if the xrs is outside the shell ) , and for the inclination of the photon direction with respect to the normal to the shell ( note that @xmath155 can be quite larger than 2 if the line of sight to the xrs is almost tangential to the ejecta shell ) .",
    "maccarone et al ( 2010 ) suggest that the weakness of the xrs in rz  2109 during the _ chandra _ 2010 observation might be explained by a large increase in the effective @xmath65 in front of the xrs .",
    "we used the web version of w3pimms ( http://heasarc.nasa.gov/tools/w3pimms.html ) to estimate that @xmath156 is necessary to explain the _ chandra _ 2010 observations .",
    "this is marginally consistent with our scenario : if we set @xmath157 , @xmath84 , @xmath158 , we can obtain such a high @xmath65 for @xmath159 . in turn",
    ", this implies that the nova eruption occurred in 20002004 ( for @xmath160 ) , which might be consistent with the timing of the z07 observations ( 20042005 ) .",
    "however , the available parameter space is very small : a slight change in the choice of @xmath155 , @xmath50 and @xmath106 can reduce the upper limit on @xmath161 , moving the nova occurrence to an epoch _ after _ the first z07 observation .",
    "therefore , we deem quite unlikely that the weakening of the xrs is ( entirely ) due to the additional absorption from the nova shell ; however , if this is the case , the xrs should re - brighten within a few years .",
    "we estimate the probability of having a nova shell with properties suitable to explain the rz  2109 observations within a distance @xmath162 from the xrs as @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath41 were introduced in sec . 2",
    ", @xmath165 is the number of stars in a gc , @xmath166 is the average stellar mass in a gc , @xmath167 is the number density of stars at the centre of a gc ( @xmath168@xmath169 ; see e.g. pryor & meylan 1993 ) , @xmath170 is the fraction of novae whose ejecta can produce the observed line emission ( a highly uncertain quantity ; since relatively massive ejecta are needed , we use 0.01 as a reference ) , and @xmath171 v_{\\rm ej,3}^{-1}$ ] acts as the visibility timescale for the [ oiii ] line emission .",
    "such a probability is of the same order of magnitude as that predicted in other scenarios such as the disruption of a wd by an imbh ( clausen & eracleous 2011 quote a disruption rate of @xmath172 from sigurdsson & rees 1997 ) , and it must be noted that the large uncertainty about several parameters in the above formula might lead to a substantial increase of @xmath173 .",
    "we note that , if the xrs is outside the nova shell , a further factor @xmath174 accounting for the possible beaming of the xrs radiation should be introduced into eq .",
    "( 2 ) : therefore , an observational confirmation of this scenario might disfavour the models of the xrs ( e.g. king 2011 ) that assume a beamed emission ( appropriate for this geometry ) should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath175 : if @xmath176 , no viable model of this kind would survive . ] .",
    "we used the photoionization code cloudy to check whether the peculiar emission spectra from xrs - hosting gcs ( especially rz  2109 ) can be explained as the result of the photoionization of a nova shell by the radiation emitted by the xrs .",
    "we found that this is definitely possible , but requires that the nova ejecta are relatively massive ( @xmath177 ) , and that the xrs - nova distance is quite small ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the combination of these two requirements is quite unlikely ; on the other hand , it can explain observations in a straightforward manner ( although the line profile needs further investigation ) . while not entirely satisfactory , this compares well with the two other proposed scenarios for rz  2109 : ( i ) the disruption of a wd by an imbh ( an event as unlikely as the one we discuss ) explains the line profile and the absence of h lines ( i10 , clausen & eracleous 2011 ) , but appears to be unable to produce the high [ oiii ] luminosity ( porter 2010 , s11 ) ; ( ii ) the ionization of material ejected from the xrs itself ,",
    "while not suffering from the `` unlikely coincidence '' problem , does not explain either the absence of h emission lines , nor some properties of the line profile ( asymmetry in the flat component , origin of the gaussian component ) .",
    "finally , we predict the future evolution of the line emission in the xrs+nova scenario , by looking at both optical and uv lines .",
    "we find that in most cases the nova shell tends to move towards a higher ionization state , so that the line flux should move from moderate - ionization lines such as [ oiii]@xmath8  to high - ionization lines ( e.g. the ovi lines in the 10321038wavelength range ) .",
    "such predictions might provide a crucial test for discriminating among the various hypotheses described above .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript , and for several very valuable suggestions ( e.g. about uv lines ) , and thank a.  wolter , l.  zampieri , a.  bressan , d.  fiacconi , s. hachinger , r. porter , and t. maccarone for useful discussions and comments .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services , and of tools provided by the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ; which is provided by nasa s goddard space flight center ) .",

    "in this appendix , we list the detailed predictions about line fluxes at earth , and about the properties of the nova ejecta ( e.g. the ionization state of c , n , o , and ne ) from the four models described in the text , evolved to five past or future epochs : april 2005 , december 2007 , march 2009 ( chosen to coincide with the times of past optical observations ) , december 2012 , and december 2017 .",
    "we report all the emission lines in the uv - optical range ( 913@xmath17810000 ) reaching a flux @xmath179 in at least one of the five considered epoch , plus lyman@xmath180 and h@xmath180 . for well - separated multiplets",
    "we list only the strongest line ( for example , in the case of the [ oiii]@xmath74959,5007  doublet we only list [ oiii]@xmath1225007 ) , whereas close multiplets are listed as a single line ( for example the [ oii]@xmath73726,3729  doublet is listed as [ oii]@xmath1223727 ) .",
    "all the fluxes are in units of @xmath181 , and were obtained assuming a distance @xmath182 .",
    "no reddening correction was applied .",
    "all the data columns - except the one referring to the z08 observation , which is taken as a reference point - report two set of data : the first was obtained assuming that the shell thickness @xmath183 remains constant at the value used for december 2007 ( implying that the density @xmath48 scales as @xmath184;assumption a ) , whereas the second was obtained assuming that @xmath47 increases linearly with time ( i.e. that @xmath185 remains constant at the value estimated for december 2007 ; in such case the density @xmath48 scales as @xmath186 ; assumption b ) .",
