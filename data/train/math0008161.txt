    "one of the main topological problems in smooth @xmath0-manifolds is to classify such @xmath0-manifolds by using numerical invariants .",
    "even though most classical invariants are not enough to distinguish smooth @xmath0-manifolds which are mutually homeomorphic , it is still of interest to know what combinations of topological invariants are realizable .",
    "similarly , one may consider the same problems in both the category of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds and the category of complex surfaces .",
    "we call these geography problems .",
    "let us describe some numerical invariants used in the geography question .",
    "note that most classical invariants for @xmath0-manifolds are encoded by the intersection form .",
    "this form is an integral unimodular symmetric bilinear pairing @xmath5 obtained by representing homology classes as smoothly embedded oriented surfaces and counting intersections with signs . by poincar duality",
    "it is equivalently defined as the cup product on the second cohomology classes . from @xmath6 one",
    "can obtain the following numerical invariants for a simply connected closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 :    * @xmath8 , called the euler characteristic of @xmath7 .",
    "* @xmath9 , called the signature of @xmath7 . *",
    "* type * of @xmath7 , which is * even * if @xmath10 , and * odd * otherwise .",
    "now we define two numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a simply connected closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 from these invariants :    * @xmath13 , which is an integer if there exists an almost complex structure on @xmath7 , and    * @xmath14 , which is equal to @xmath15 if there exists an almost complex structure on @xmath7",
    ".    then a pair @xmath16 of numbers determines the intersection form @xmath6 up to type , so that a pair @xmath17 determines the @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 up to homeomorphism and type due to m. freedman s classification theorem of simply connected topological @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "thus it is natural to ask whether a pair @xmath18 of numbers determines a smooth ( or symplectic ) @xmath0-manifold in the category of smooth ( or symplectic ) @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "explicitly , we may ask the following two questions : +   +   + these are the geography problems of @xmath0-manifolds in which we are interested . note that the questions above are meaningful in the category of irreducible @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "otherwise , one can easily get an answer for those questions through the connected sum of other @xmath0-manifolds . here",
    "we call a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 _ irreducible _ if it is not a connected sum of other smooth @xmath0-manifolds except for a homotopy @xmath0-sphere , i.e. if @xmath19 implies that one of @xmath20 is a homotopy @xmath0-sphere .    despite the fact that it was a fundamental problem in the category of @xmath0-manifolds , the geography problem for smooth @xmath0-manifolds and for symplectic @xmath0-manifolds",
    "had long been unsolvable until gauge theory was introduced .",
    "since the geography problem has almost the same answer even if we restrict ourselves to symplectic manifolds , from now on we only consider geography problems of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "since gauge theory was introduced by s. donaldson in 1982 , this area has rapidly been developed .",
    "in particular , as an application of the seiberg - witten theory to symplectic @xmath0-manifolds , many remarkable results about symplectic @xmath0-manifolds have been obtained .",
    "for example , c. taubes proved that every irreducible symplectic @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 with @xmath21 has a non - zero seiberg - witten invariant and satisfies @xmath22 ( @xcite ) . besides , geography problems for irreducible symplectic @xmath0-manifolds have been extensively studied by topologists such as r. fintushel , r. gompf , a. stipsicz , z. szab and the author , so that most existence problems for irreducible symplectic @xmath0-manifolds are settled ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but , when we restrict our concern to spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds , it is still mysterious which lattice points in the ( @xmath1)-plane are realized by simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "note that every spin symplectic @xmath0-manifold is automatically _",
    "irreducible _ because its seiberg - witten invariant is non - zero due to c. taubes theorem above , so that , if it were not irreducible , it would be a blow up of another manifold contradicting the spin hypothesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "since a spin structure on a manifold is a purely topological invariant ( @xcite ) , there is a topological restriction on for spin @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "that is , every spin symplectic @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 satisfies @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , if a @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 has a signature , then it also satisfies @xmath24 . hence the interesting questions are : which lattice points in the ( @xmath1)-plane satisfying @xmath25",
    "are realized as @xmath26 of simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds , and then , if there exists such a spin symplectic @xmath0-manifold corresponding to a given lattice point @xmath18 , are there many distinct symplectic structures on it ?",
    "one may also ask the same questions for lattice points lying in the positive signature region : @xmath27    in this paper , we give an answer for these geography problems .",
    "first we answer the existence question as follows : roughly , by taking a symplectic fiber sum along an embedded surfaces of self - intersection @xmath28 introduced by r. gompf ( @xcite ) , we construct a family of simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which cover all ` allowed ' lattice points in the wedge between the elliptic line ( @xmath29 ) and a line @xmath30 , which is parallel to the noether line . and then , by taking a symplectic fiber sum repeatedly along a torus embedded in both such @xmath0-manifolds constructed above and an appropriate spin symplectic @xmath0-manifold with positive signature , we are able to construct desired simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "we also investigate the uniqueness question for symplectic @xmath0-manifolds . in general",
    ", since the seiberg - witten invariant of a smooth @xmath0-manifold with @xmath31 is a diffeomorphic invariant , one can easily produce a family of smooth @xmath0-manifolds which are mutually homeomorphic , but which are not diffeomorphic by showing that they have different seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "one way to obtain such a family of smooth @xmath0-manifolds is to use _ a logarithmic transformation _ on a tubular neighborhood of a regular fiber lying in a cusp neighborhood ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another way to obtain such a family of smooth @xmath0-manifolds is to use _",
    "@xmath28-framed surgery _ on a knot @xmath32 embedded in @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that both techniques above can be performed symplectically in some cases .",
    "for example , if @xmath32 is a fibered knot in @xmath33 , r. fintushel and r. stern constructed a family of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which are all homotopy @xmath34 surfaces and which are pairwise non - diffeomorphic ( @xcite ) .",
    "since any two symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which are non - diffeomorphic are automatically non - symplectomorphic , their examples actually admit many distinct _",
    "symplectic _ structures .",
    "we are going to use this technique to conclude that all simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds obtained in the following main theorem admit infinitely many distinct symplectic structures .",
    "[ main ] there is a line @xmath35 with a slope @xmath36 in the @xmath37-plane such that any allowed lattice point satisfying @xmath38 in the first quadrant can be realized as @xmath26 of a simply connected spin non - complex symplectic @xmath0-manifold which admits infinitely many distinct symplectic structures . in particular , all allowed lattice points @xmath37 except finitely many lying in the region @xmath39 satisfy @xmath38 .",
    "park and z. szab got a similar result in  @xcite .",

    "+ finally we investigate exotic smooth structures on a connected sum @xmath0-manifold , denoted by @xmath3 , of an odd number of copies of a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath46 .",
    "we say that a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 admits an _ exotic _ smooth structure if it has more than one distinct smooth structure , i.e. there exists a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath47 which is homeomorphic to @xmath7 , but not diffeomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "it has long been an interesting question whether a connected sum @xmath0-manifold @xmath3 admits an exotic smooth structure or not . in this paper , as a corollary of theorem  [ main ] above , we have the following remarkable result .",

    "we start this section by briefly reviewing the geography problem of minimal complex surfaces .",
    "it is well known that every simply connected minimal complex surface is one of rational or ruled surfaces , elliptic surfaces and complex surfaces of general type . the geography problem for minimal complex surfaces of general type has been studied extensively by algebraic surface theorists .",

    "furthermore , if it satisfies @xmath58{12 } }         \\chi ^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ ] , then it is realized as @xmath26 of a simply connected minimal complex surface which is a genus two lefschetz fibration ( @xcite ) .",
    "* by modifying g. xiao s construction of non - spin complex surfaces which are hyperelliptic fibrations , u. persson , c. peters and g. xiao constructed infinitely many simply connected spin complex surfaces with positive signature which are fibrations over @xmath59 even though these are not hyperelliptic fibrations .",
    "roughly , these are constructed by using a triple sequence of double coverings @xmath60 branched at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , where branch - loci @xmath63 and @xmath64 are chosen suitably in @xmath65 so that @xmath66 is a simply connected spin singular complex with positive signature .",
    "after desingularization of @xmath66 and blowing down disjoint exceptional curves , they obtained a lefschetz fibration @xmath67 .",
    "note that it is not hyperelliptic because its generic fiber is a @xmath68-cover over @xmath59 ( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "now let us consider spin @xmath0-manifolds . recall that an oriented manifold is called _ spin _ if the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath69 of the manifold is zero .",
    "equivalently , the intersection form of the manifold is of even type in the simply connected case . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the spin condition gives a topological restriction on @xmath70 and @xmath71 for a spin @xmath0-manifold @xmath7 .",

    "lemma  [ lem - spin ] above tells us that only lattice points ( @xmath1 ) satisfying both @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be possibly realized as @xmath26 of spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds - we call these ` allowed ' lattice points . but",
    "it is still not fully known which allowed lattice points in the ( @xmath55)-plane are covered by simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds .",

    "_ every simply connected spin symplectic @xmath0-manifold in theorem  [ main-1 ] admits infinitely many distinct symplectic structures . _",
    "+ as a background for the proof of claim 1 , let us introduce r. fintushel and r. stern s technique ( see @xcite for details ) : suppose @xmath32 is a fibered knot in @xmath33 with a punctured surface @xmath230 of genus @xmath108 as a fiber .",
    "let @xmath231 be a @xmath119-manifold obtained by performing @xmath28-framed surgery on @xmath32 , and let @xmath232 be a meridional circle to @xmath32 .",
    "then the @xmath119-manifold @xmath231 can be considered as a fiber bundle over a circle @xmath232 with a closed riemann surface @xmath188 as a fiber , and there is a smoothly embedded torus @xmath233 of self - intersection @xmath28 in @xmath234 .",

    "since any two symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which have different seiberg - witten invariants are automatically non - symplectomorphic , we will apply theorem  [ fs-2 ] to prove claim 1 . for this",

    "+ in order to compute the sw - basic classes of spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds in theorem  [ main-1 ] , we use the following two product formulas for the seiberg - witten invariant of a fiber sum @xmath0-manifold .",
    "[ mms ] suppose @xmath7 and @xmath86 are smooth @xmath0-manifolds with which contain an embedded torus @xmath165 in a cusp neighborhood .",
    "then the seiberg - witten invariant of a fiber sum @xmath0-manifold @xmath258 is given by @xmath259    [ mst ] let @xmath7 and @xmath86 be closed oriented smooth @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath260 and @xmath261 which contain a smoothly embedded surface @xmath87 with genus @xmath262 representing a homology class of infinite order and of square zero .",

    "theorem  [ mms ] tells us the complete seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath258 obtained by a taking a fiber sum along a torus @xmath165 in a cusp neighborhood .",
    "on the other hand , theorem  [ mst ] implies that there exists at least one sw - basic class of @xmath96 obtained by taking a fiber sum along an embedded surface @xmath87 of genus @xmath273 under an appropriate condition . +   note that spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds @xmath47 , @xmath153 , @xmath7 and @xmath247 in the proof of theorem  [ main-1 ] are of the forms @xmath274      now let us try to find sw - basic classes of @xmath47 , @xmath153 , @xmath7 , and @xmath247 consecutively : first , since the manifold @xmath47 is a blow up of an algebraic surface @xmath143 of general type and @xmath143 has only one up to sign sw - basic class @xmath32 , the canonical class of @xmath143 , the sw - basic classes of @xmath47 are up to sign of the forms @xmath277 , where @xmath278 is a class represented by an exceptional curve in @xmath279 . secondly ,",
    "since @xmath153 is the @xmath0-manifold obtained by taking a fiber sum along @xmath280 and @xmath87 is a symplectically embedded surface in @xmath47 , it satisfies the hypotheses of theorem  [ mst ] above .",
    "hence , by applying theorem  [ mst ] or v. mu@xmath281oz result in  @xcite , it is easy to check that only a pair @xmath282 of sw - basic classes of @xmath283 induces the sw - basic class of @xmath153 , denoted by @xmath284 . next , since @xmath86 is also a minimal complex surface of general type , it has only one sw - basic class up to sign , say @xmath285 .",
    "then , by applying theorem  [ mst ] on a fiber sum manifold @xmath207 again , we obtain one sw - basic class of @xmath286 induced from @xmath287 , which is denoted by @xmath288 . by repeating",
    "the same procedures as above , we get one sw - basic class up to sign , say @xmath289 , of a fiber sum manifold @xmath7 .",
    "finally , let us compute sw - basic class of our manifold @xmath247 .",
    "since horikawa surfaces @xmath290 and @xmath162 have only one sw - basic class , say @xmath291 and @xmath292 , respectively , and since an elliptic surface @xmath174 has the following sw - basic classes @xmath293 where @xmath140 is a regular torus fiber in the nucleus @xmath294 , by applying theorem  [ mms ] repeatedly on a lagrangian torus @xmath165 embedded in brieskorn submanifolds of @xmath7 , @xmath290 , @xmath162 and @xmath153 , we obtain sw - basic classes up to sign of @xmath247 : @xmath295 note that all these manifolds , @xmath247 , have obviously more than one sw - basic class .",
    "this means that any such a manifold @xmath247 with @xmath296 can not be diffeomorphic to a complex surface of general type . in the case when @xmath217 , we already constructed a family of simply connected spin non - complex symplectic @xmath0-manifolds @xmath173 covering the elliptic line in the proof of proposition  [ main - pro ] .",
