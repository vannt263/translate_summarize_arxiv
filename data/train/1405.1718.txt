    "the @xmath4cdm model of cosmology continues to withstand all observational tests of modern precision cosmology , and its triumph can only be compared to the similarly impressive performance of the standard model ( sm ) of particles and fields . among the most nontrivial tests of the standard cosmological paradigm is the comparison of the big bang nucleosynethesis ( bbn ) predictions , ever sharpened by the independent cmb - based determination of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath5 , with observations .",
    "the latest most precise determination is from the planck collaboration , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "bbn respresents an early cosmological epoch ( @xmath7 s ) , when the process of expansion and cooling of the universe resulted in the creation of a few stable nuclei besides hydrogen .",
    "its main effect is the creation of the sizable amount of helium .",
    "the determination of the helium abundance and its extrapolation to the primordial value is in perfect agreement with bbn predictions , once all sources of systematic errors are taken into account ( see _ e.g. _ current review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "besides @xmath8he , the bbn produces other light elements , and of particular interest for cosmology is the amount of primordial deuterium , surviving from incomplete burning at the bbn times .",
    "the determination of primordial deuterium abundance is a thorny issue in cosmology , as observations are difficult and performed only in a handful of damped lyman-@xmath9 systems . for a while ,",
    "the scatter between different observations was significantly larger than the error bars would imply , which could have been an indication for the deuterium depletion .",
    "however , over the course of the last two years , significant advances in the determination of d / h have been made @xcite , and the recently re - analyzed data point to a remarkable result @xcite = ( 2.53 0.04)10 ^ -5 .",
    "[ cooke ] this result is in good agreement with the bbn predictions , see _",
    "e.g. _ recent evaluations in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has strong implications for many non - standard modifications of the cosmological model .    unlike deuterium , another trace element , @xmath0li , has been  problematic \" for over a decade .",
    "( for a detailed exposition of the problem , see _",
    "e.g. _ the dedicated reviews @xcite . )",
    "the problem stems from the discrepancy of the bbn prediction with the primordial value for @xmath0li / h extracted from the absorption spectra in the atmospheres of the old stars .",
    "the absence of scatter in @xmath0li / h , and its remarkable constancy as a function of metallicity was discovered more than thirty years ago by f.  spite and m.  spite @xcite . throughout the 90-s ,",
    "the spite plateau value was believed to be a fair representation of the primordial value , and was widely used for the extraction of @xmath5 . at the current value for @xmath5 , it is well - known that the dominant fraction of predicted @xmath0li comes initially in the form of @xmath0be , which later on undergoes the capture process and becomes @xmath0li .",
    "current bbn predictions   @xcite , @xmath10 are a factor of @xmath11 larger than the spite plateau value , @xmath12 @xcite , and @xmath13 @xcite , and many @xmath14 away from it . + the goal of our paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we would like to update the details of the neutron injection mechanism in one particular model based on neutron - mirror - neutron oscillation .",
    "earlier work by three of us on the subject @xcite has to be extended to include the thermal modification of the oscillation effects that will affect both the strength and the temporal pattern of the neutron injection due do the oscillation from the mirror world .",
    "it is often the case that the injection of extra neutrons in models with decaying or annihilating particles is accompanied by additional non - thermal effects , and in that sence nbbn with mirror matter is the ",
    "cleanest \" realization of extra - neutrons scenario , as non - thermal effects are absent .",
    "the second goal of our paper is to scan over the temporal patterns of the neutron injection of various types to determine whether this mechanism _ by itself _ is a sufficient reducer of @xmath0li / h that can also keep deuterium abundance consistent with observations .",
    "this second part can be viewed as an extension of the previous studies @xcite . + this paper is organized as follows . after discussing the different possible solutions to the lithium problem in section  [ sec2 ] , section  [ sec3 ] details the realistic pattern for the @xmath15 oscillations in the presence of mirror matter taking into account thermal effects . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we compare different temporal patterns of neutron injection to find out if any nbbn scenarios are consistent with both @xmath0li and d abundances .",
    "we reach our conclusion in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "at this point , it is entirely not clear what resolves the lithium problem , and several logical pathways towards the resolution have been pursued ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    1 .",
    "the amount of predicted @xmath0li is more sensitive than @xmath8he to the adopted values for the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "while the main reactions determining the abundance of @xmath0li are now known with sufficient accuracy , for a while there was a possibility that some subdominant channels could increase the burning of @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "after much scrutiny @xcite , such possibilities look increasingly unlikely .",
    "the stars are known to deplete heavier elements from their photosphere .",
    "the atomic diffusion at the bottom of the convective envelope ( finely counterbalanced by the turbulent mixing ) is often invoked as a possible mechanism for depleting lithium in pop ii stars @xcite .",
    "while certain amount of depletion will indeed happen for all stars , it is far from clear that it can occur uniformly for all stars along the spite plateau without destroying its uniformity . in recent years",
    ", further questions are raised by the discovery of the  meltdown \" of the spite plateau for the metallicities below @xmath16 @xcite , for which no convincing explanation is found so far .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that all lithium observations are made within stars that were born within or accreted to the milky way galaxy and its satellites , while the determination of @xmath5 is global .",
    "one can not exclude some rather exceptional cosmological models where the uniformity of matter distribution is sacrificed and _ e.g. _ local value for @xmath5 is a factor of 3 lower than globally , leading to an  accidental \" local lithium underabundance @xcite .",
    "4 .   finally",
    ", particle physics may come to rescue and provide a modification to the standard bbn scenario in such a way that the lithium abundance is modified . among most promising pathways",
    "are models with hadronic energy injection at the time of the bbn , or catalysis of certain nuclear reactions by the presence of negatively charged relics . for a review of possible options",
    "see _ e.g. _ @xcite .    to summarize this discussion :",
    "because of inherent doubts about the fidelity with which the spite plateau reproduces the primordial lithium abundance , it is admissible to think that the cosmological lithium problem may indeed be in a category of the ",
    "astrophysical puzzles \" rather than be an immediate make - or - break challenge to the standard cosmological paradigm .",
    "in this paper we give a further look into a problem of non - standard bbn with additional neutron injection ( nbbn ) by a beyond - sm source .",
    "it was recognized by reno and seckel in the 1980s that this class of scenarios will lead to the suppression of the freeze - out abundance of @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "this mechanism works by enhancing the conversion of beryllium to lithium , @xmath0be(@xmath17)@xmath0li , immediately after @xmath0be is created , followed by more efficient proton burning of @xmath0li , @xmath0li@xmath18)@xmath9 . after the cmb - based determination of @xmath5 and the emergence of the cosmological lithium problem ,",
    "this mechanism was further emphasized and investigated by jedamzik @xcite , with many concrete particle physics realizations of the scenario built over the years @xcite .",
    "it is also well known @xcite that nbbn will cause a rise in the abundance of d / h , and given new tight constraints , ( [ cooke ] ) , one may question if the neutron injection mechanism is still a valid agent for reducing the cosmological abundance of lithium .",
    "a mirror sector is constructed by assuming that the gauge group @xmath19 of the matter sector is doubled to the product @xmath20 . imposing a mirror parity under the exchange",
    "@xmath21 implies that the lagrangian of the two sectors , ordinary and mirror , are identical so that they have the same particles content such that ordinary ( resp .",
    "mirror ) matter fields belonging to @xmath19 ( resp .",

    "@xmath19 ) .",
    "they also have the same fundamental constants ( gauge and yukawa couplings , higgs vev ) .",
    "the latter point implies that the microphysics ( and in particular the nuclear sector ) is identical in both sectors .",
    "the two sectors are coupled through gravity , and can eventually interact via some couplings so that the general form of the matter lagrangian is @xmath23 such a sector was initially proposed by li and yang  @xcite in an attempt to restore global parity symmetry and was then widely investigated  @xcite . any _",
    "neutral _ ordinary particle , fundamental or composite , can be coupled to its mirror partner hence leading to the possibility of oscillation between ordinary and mirror particles .",
    "for instance a mixing term of the form @xmath24 will induce a photon - mirror photon oscillation , ordinary neutrinos can mix with mirror neutrinos and oscillate in sterile neutrinos  @xcite . among all the possible mixing terms , special attention has been drawn  @xcite to the mixing induced between neutrons and mirror neutrons . such a possibility is open as soon as @xmath25 contains a term @xmath26 ; see e.g. ref.@xcite for details .",
    "it was also pointed out  @xcite that a neutron ",
    "mirror neutron oscillation could be considerably faster than neutron decay , which would have interesting experimental and astrophysical implications .",
    "we begin by analyzing @xmath27 case for the oscillation between  our world \" neutron @xmath28 and the  mirror world \" neutron - like particle @xmath29 .",
    "we will assume an _ approximate _ mirror symmetry that sets the masses of @xmath28 and @xmath29 particles nearly equal , so that in @xmath30 relation , @xmath31 .",
    "we will allow for the interaction between the two sectors , that mixes the wave functions of normal and mirror neutrons , @xmath32 @xmath33 are the decay rates of @xmath34 . without loss of generality one can take the mixing parameter @xmath35 in the mixing matrix @xmath36 to be real and positive .",
    "there is a significant freedom in the choice of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath35 , limited only by the experiments with ultracold neutrons , and by theoretical considerations related to the compositeness of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the quark composition of @xmath28 , and presumably a similar quark@xmath38 composition of @xmath29 dictates that @xmath35 parameter is not  elementary \" , but in fact is a descendant of a higher - dimensional operator that connect normal and mirror sectors . the lowest dimension",
    "6-quark operator responsible for such mixing will be given by _",
    "mix = |_n _ n + ( h.c . ) where @xmath4 is roughly the high - energy scale where such operator is generated , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the three - quark currents that interpolate between vacuum and @xmath28 states : @xmath41 with an analogous expression for @xmath29 .",
    "it is fair to take @xmath4 at the weak scale and above ( given no signs of new physics at the lhc ) , @xmath42 gev .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath39 current is known from hadronic physics , @xmath43 . taking same matrix element in the mirror sector , we arrive at the following matching condition , m_12 = 410 ^ -4   gev^6 ^-5 m_12 210 ^ -7 ev .",
    "[ limit12 ] we conclude that mixing matrix elements below @xmath44 ev are in general compatible with the composite nature of nucleons and the absence of new physics below the weak scale .",
    "we next address the question of what experimental constraints on the combination of @xmath37 and @xmath35 the precision measurements with neutrons would impose .",
    "interestingly this issue had seen some lively debates , and is not as straightforward as it may sound .",
    "starting from the mass matrix @xmath36 , one can derive the zero - temperature probability for the @xmath46 oscillation , .p_nn",

    "@xcite quotes the limit on @xmath35 under strict mirror symmetry @xmath53 , @xmath54  ev . the point of contention in these limits is often in an extra assumption of no extra contributions to 11 and 22 elements of @xmath36 from the magnetic fields that an experimenter can control and mirror magnetic field ( that is beyond his / her control ) @xcite .    in what follows we are going to consider the following hierarchical pattern , [ hierarchy ] _",

    "@xcite , @xmath56 , which is derived without assuming @xmath57 . for the chosen hierarchy ( [ hierarchy ] ) this limit implies [ explimit ] 310 ^ -6 .",
    "notice that once ( [ limit12 ] ) and ( [ explimit ] ) are satisfied , in principle both @xmath35 and @xmath58 can be much larger than the inverse of the neutron lifetime in vacuum , and much larger than the hubble rate during the bbn , h = .",
    "here @xmath59 is the photon temperature in units of @xmath60 k , and at the bbn epoch relevant for @xmath0li+@xmath0be formation , @xmath61 is in the interval @xmath62hz or @xmath63 ev .",
    "the main point of this section is that under the conditions that exist in the early universe , the oscillation probabilities are changed rather drastically .",
    "the physical reason for that is that the hypothesized @xmath46 oscillation is a quantum phenomenon that requires coherence in the phase of the wave function to be preserved .",
    "however , rapid rescaterings of neutrons on electrons and positrons , photons and protons ( and presumably with similar processes in the mirror sector ) leads to a rapid  reset \" of the quantum phase .",
    "the neutron collision rate @xmath64 determines the coherence time interval , @xmath65 , and in the regime when @xmath64 is larger than any other dimensionful parameters , the time - average oscillation probability will scale as @xmath66 , and the _ rate _ for the neutron - mirror - neutron interconversion will be @xmath67 .",
    "these are very important modifications of the oscillation rate , and we address them below in a more quantitative manner .    first , for the reasons explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the temperature of the mirror world is smaller , as well as the number density of mirror baryons .",
    "this means that in the scattering processes the main contributions come from @xmath28 and not @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the decay rates for @xmath34 particles are subdominant to the rescattering rates , and thus can be neglected in the calculation of the oscillation probability .",
    "we then have the following modification of the @xmath15 mass matrix , [ moft ] m _ eff = (    cc m + m_eff ( t ) -_eff(t ) & m_12 + m_12 & 0    ) . in this formula",
    ", the temperature - dependent mass shift @xmath68 is induced by the real part of the neutron forward scattering amplitude , while the imaginary part , @xmath69 , by optical theorem is related to the total cross section . since @xmath35 is very small ,",
    "the process of @xmath46 oscillation is best described as the perturbation on top of the scattering processes that preserve number of neutrons .",
    "the oscillation rate is given by the rescattering rate mutiplied by the square of the _ effective _ mixing angle , and because of the thermal effects , @xmath70 , @xmath71 this treatment follows a well - established formalism for @xmath72 oscillations that can be found _",

    "the average is taken over the velocity distribution of particles in the bath .",
    "we will approximate @xmath69 by the sum of the two most important contributions : electromagnetic scattering on electrons and positrons and strong force scattering on protons .",

    "( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath81 .",
    "the plot of @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . as one can see , there is a kink in @xmath69 at @xmath82  kev , signalling the change from the scattering on electrons and positrons to the predominantly scattering on protons . because of the relatively large value of @xmath69 at early times ,",
    "the oscillation between normal and mirror world neutrons will be suppressed .",
    "next , we address the question of the effective mass shift @xmath68 due to scattering . to that purpose , one needs to calculate the neutron forward scattering amplitude without change of the spin direction .",
    "magnetic moment of the neutron does not contribute to the effect in the first order of perturbation theory , because it requires the spin flip .",
    "the scattering on protons then is the leading effect , and one can deduce that m_eff ( t ) - f(0)n_p , and @xmath83 can be taken directly from data on the @xmath77 scattering length . after working out the numerics , we conclude that the mass shift is not important for the problem under consideration .",
    "it is true that since the @xmath37 sign is not known a priori , there is a possibility of a cancellation between @xmath37 and @xmath84 in the rate formula ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "however , the emergent resonance is not sharp , being dominate by @xmath85 .",
    "this is the main reason why the mass shift effects can be neglected .",
    "finally , we present several representative cases for the @xmath15 oscillation rate in fig .",
    "2 , for different choices of @xmath37 and @xmath35 . of course , the most relevant parameter is the rate weighted by the hubble expansion rate .",
    "when @xmath86 , the oscillations are occuring efficiently , and if it is much smaller than one , the oscillation mechanism for changing neutron abundance can be neglected . as fig .",
    "2 clearly demonstrates , the actual behavior is very sensitive to the underlying choice of @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "only a sufficiently large value of @xmath35 can ensure @xmath86 , and in particular the choice of @xmath50 and @xmath87  ev ( border - line of the existing bounds in the exact mirror symmetry case ) , will lead to @xmath88 at all times when the neutron - mediated @xmath0be burning is possible .",
    "therefore , the only reasonable chance for reducing lithium abundance this way is to accept a small but non - zero value for @xmath37 .",
    "we now present our main results for nbbn focusing on 4 main mechanisms of neutron injection .",
    "while the previous section describes in details the implementation of the oscillation of neutron with mirror world neutrons , there are three other possibilities to inject neutrons during bbn .",

    "any large primordial downward fluctuation @xmath5 , isolated in space and coincident with a position of the milky way , may just achieve the required reduction of lithium-7 locally without affecting global determination of @xmath5 .",
    "while , because of inherent doubts about the fidelity with which the spite plateau reproduces the primordial lithium abundance , it is admissible to think that the cosmological lithium problem may indeed be in a category of the ",

    "<S> during big bang nucleosynthesis , any injection of extra neutrons around the time of the @xmath0be formation , i.e. at a temperature of order @xmath1  kev , can reduce the predicted freeze - out amount of @xmath0be + @xmath0li that otherwise remains in sharp contradiction with the spite plateau value inferred from the observations of pop ii stars . </S>",

    "<S> if the extra neutron supply is the sole non - standard mechanism operating during the bbn , the suppression of lithium abundance below li / h  @xmath2 always leads to the overproduction of deuterium , d / h  @xmath3 , well outside the error bars suggested by recent observations . </S>"
