    "however , in such materials , it is more convenient to calculate the upper critical magnetic induction @xmath25 , which arises from the complicated interplay of ferromagnetic and diamagnetic superconducting components in the single function @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the field - dependent magnetization .",
    "one can probe the bulk properties of the superconductivity by measuring the @xmath21 and differently oriented @xmath23 dependencies of @xmath25@xcite .",
    "ambient pressure measurements of the bulk probe @xmath25 and of local probes such as muon depolarization experiments of orthorhombic ucoge @xcite and urhge@xcite showed that the superconductivity exists completely within the ferromagnetic @xmath21 range and that the same electrons are responsible for the superconductivity and the ferromagnetism @xcite . in some non - ferromagnetic @xmath28-wave superconductors , such as the purported doped topological insulators , although @xmath29 , there can still be complications due to competing surface and bulk properties .",

    "p_-wave states can still be characterized in those materials by bulk measurements of @xmath30 for a variety of @xmath23 orientations .",
    "the orbital symmetry of the superconducting order parameter usually can be classified by its nodes both in the order parameter and in the resulting superconducting energy gap .",
    "for @xmath28-wave superconductors free of long - range ferromagnetism , one may have a nodeless gap , such as for the isotropic balian - werthamer ( bw ) state of @xmath31he @xcite , or a gap with either planar nodes ( polar state ) , or point nodes ( axial state ) , where it vanishes on the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "the basic order parameter symmetries of these three basic order parameters are depicted in fig .",
    "each of these states possesses unique @xmath21 and @xmath32 orientational dependencies of @xmath30 , which are useful in identifying the orbital symmetries experimentally .",
    "it was shown theoretically by scharnberg and klemm that for @xmath28-wave superconductors with an isotropic equal - spin pairing interaction of the form @xmath33 , which leads to an isotropic bw state for @xmath34 with an isotropic gap function as sketched in fig .",
    "1(a ) , @xmath30 is always given by that of the polar state , @xmath35@xcite , in which @xmath23 always points in an antinodal order parameter direction .",
    "this is analogous to the interaction of @xmath23 with spins through the rotationally - invariant heisenberg interaction with an isotropic @xmath36-tensor . to avoid confusion with the various order parameter states , we hereby designate @xmath37 .",
    "except for the @xmath28-wave chiral abm states@xcite , when @xmath23 lies along the antinodal direction , @xmath38 , even though the state symmetry may be very different than that of the polar state .",
    "@xmath39 has a much straighter @xmath21 dependence than any other @xmath28-wave or @xmath40-wave state in pure , three - dimensional materials with a spherical ( or ellipsoidal , as shown here ) fs@xcite .",
    "although one might question the notion of an isotropic @xmath28-wave pairing interaction in a layered superconductor@xcite , the apparent presence of a rather isotropic gap in the doped topological insulator , cu@xmath41bi@xmath42se@xmath43@xcite , led the de visser group to investigate @xmath30 both @xmath44 and @xmath45 to the bi@xmath42se@xmath43 layers , and they found good agreement with the appropriately scaled @xmath39 in both directions@xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    scharnberg and klemm also investigated the effects of two pairing states perpendicular to @xmath23 within the framework of the rotationally symmetric @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , there are two order parameter components , which are usually written as @xmath48 , both components of which nominally share the same @xmath20 .",
    "these are the two chiral manifestations of the anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) state of @xmath31he@xcite , in which only parallel - spin pairing with one spin state is involved .",
    "these abm states with @xmath34 have a gap function with a nodal point , as sketched in fig .",
    "scharnberg and klemm also investigated @xmath49 for the special case of @xmath23 along the nodal point direction normal to the pairing plane of these chiral abm states , and found that @xmath50 for either of these abm states exhibited a @xmath21 dependence that rose even more slowly with decreasing @xmath21 than did @xmath51 for a pure , isotropic @xmath40-wave superconductor on a spherical ( or ellipsoidal , as shown here ) fs in the absence of pauli - limiting effects@xcite .",
    "however , scharnberg and klemm then investigated the effects of the two combined chiral abm pairing states perpendicular to @xmath23 . in effect , they calculated @xmath49 for the two - component state containing an unequal amplitude mix of the two chiral abm states , @xmath52@xcite .",
    "the sk state is a chiral state except for the special cases when @xmath53 , for which it is non - chiral .",
    "for those special cases , one may write @xmath54 , which may be rewritten as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 . except for the overall constant phase @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 is therefore a real function of @xmath57 and hence non - chiral whenever @xmath60 .",
    "the magnetic analog of this degenerate , two - component state is the anisotropic xy model of spin - spin interactions , in which there is an easy plane normal to a hard axis for spin - spin interactions with @xmath23 in that plane , but the interactions within the easy plane can be either isotropic or anisotropic , depending upon the field direction .",
    "although they originally denoted this as the `` generalized abm state''@xcite , this state came to be known as the sk state@xcite . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the chiral sk state has @xmath61 .",
    "however , for @xmath62 , the sk state is non - chiral just below @xmath39@xcite .",
    "the precise form of @xmath63 and the interesting transition from chiral to non - chiral signatures in @xmath64 for the sk state at precise intermediate @xmath15 values will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "although not mentioned in the original paper@xcite , the sk and abm states might be favored in superconductors with uniaxial symmetry such as certain layered superconductors@xcite , for which @xmath65 could lock onto the layers , breaking the axial rotational degree of freedom of the antinodal plane .",
    "sr@xmath42ruo@xmath66 has often been mentioned as a likely candidate for either the single parallel - spin chiral abm state or the dual parallel - spin sk state , which is either chiral or non - chiral , depending upon the direction of @xmath23 , although many of the authors were apparently unaware of the proper designation of the latter state they described@xcite . for the abm state ,",
    "when @xmath23 is parallel to the antinodal plane , @xmath49 is given by the new form @xmath67@xcite .",
    "neither the abm nor the sk state appears to be consistent with the experiments of @xmath68 parallel to the layers of sr@xmath42ruo@xmath66@xcite , which show that @xmath68 is strongly pauli limited@xcite .",
    "recent scanning tunneling microscopy on that material were also inconsistent with gap nodes@xcite . regardless of whether sr@xmath42ruo@xmath66 or some other as yet undiscovered material will be the first manifestation of the sk or abm states , @xmath69 at an arbitrary angle @xmath15 with respect to the fixed nodal point direction of the sk or abm states with the normal state electrons on a general ellipsoidal fs will be presented elsewhere@xcite .    finally , the case of particular interest in this paper is that of an anisotropic @xmath28-wave pairing interaction with equal - spin pairing along only one direction , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) analog of @xmath46 , or @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this state , @xmath71 , has come to be known as the polar / cbs state , for a polar state of completely broken rotational symmetry , analogous to the ising interaction representing the dominant easy - axis component of the highly anisotropic 3d heisenberg spin - spin interaction . a sketch of the polar / cbs gap function is given in fig . 1(c ) .",
    "as for the abm or sk superconducting states in a crystal , the 1d pairing is fixed to the crystal lattice , but in this case , to one crystal axis direction only .",
    "the largest intrinsic anisotropy due solely to the order parameter arises between the field applied parallel and perpendicular to this single pairing direction .",
    "if the field is along the pairing or antinodal direction , as in the 3d case , one obtains @xmath39@xcite .",
    "however , when the field is applied in the planar nodal direction perpendicular to the pairing , then @xmath49 has a distinctly different form , @xmath63 , similar to but not identical to @xmath51 @xcite . summarizing the various cases evaluated prior to this work",
    ", we have for all @xmath21 with pairing on spherical fss@xcite , @xmath72    the angular dependence of either @xmath30 or @xmath73 for the 1d polar / cbs state case is important to aid experimentalists in determining its realization in materials such as urhge .",
    "these new results are the focus of this paper .",
    "since urhge , the existing material for which this polar / cbs state has been strongly supported by experiment @xcite , has an orthorhombic crystal structure @xcite , its fs can be approximated as a general ellipsoid .",
    "although the critical field data of ucoge are more suggestive of an sk or abm state at low @xmath23 values , its crystal structure is also orthorhombic @xcite . hence , we have derived the prescription for including general ellipsoidal fs anisotropies into microscopic calculations of @xmath74 for a general anisotropic pairing interaction @xmath75 , and with the magnetic induction @xmath76 in a general direction .",
    "the details of the derivation are presented in the appendix . in this paper",
    ", we used this procedure to calculate the full angular dependence of @xmath77 for the polar / cbs state of a ferromagnetic superconductor dominated by a single parallel - spin state , and our results are presented .",
    "in the extraordinary case of urhge , @xmath73 measurements on a sample with a residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) = 21 were fit to the scharnberg - klemm theory of the @xmath28-wave polar / cbs state along all three crystallographic directions , with equal spin pairing along the @xmath78-axis direction and weak ferromagnetism along the @xmath79-axis direction in the low - field regime , using the resistively measured slopes of @xmath14 along the @xmath78- , @xmath80- , and @xmath79-axis directions just below the ferromagnetic demagnetization jumps at @xmath20 as the only fitting parameters@xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath81 fit the predicted @xmath39 behavior , but @xmath82 and @xmath83 fit the qualitatively different @xmath63 curve@xcite , with a constant ratio @xmath84 consistent with @xmath21-independent fs anisotropy .",
    "@xmath85 in all three crystal directions violated the pauli limit @xmath86 t / k for a singlet - spin @xmath40-wave superconductor @xcite , indicating that urhge is very unlikely to be an @xmath40- or @xmath87-wave superconductor .",
    "consequently , these data provided strong evidence that the superconducting order parameter is likely to have the simplest parallel - spin @xmath28-wave orbital form @xmath88 consistent with ferromagnetism in the @xmath89 plane of an orthorhombic crystal , where the pair - spin vector @xmath90 , and the @xmath28-wave pairing interaction fixed to the crystal @xmath78-axis direction for all @xmath91 directions and the two possible parallel - spin states indicated by @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "subsequent measurements on a urhge sample with rrr = 50 @xcite observed an anomalous high @xmath94 reentrant superconducting phase@xcite , further supporting the idea of a @xmath28-wave parallel spin state .",
    "but the low - field regime @xmath95 within the @xmath96 plane was consistent with ordinary fs anisotropy , at least within the experimental resolution @xcite .",
    "at first sight , these results appear to be in contradiction with the earlier measurements of @xmath14 in urhge @xcite .",
    "note that these results are different than those obtained from hexagonal upt@xmath97 , which has antiferromagnetic domains with the magnetic ordering along the @xmath78-axis direction , and for @xmath98 , the resulting @xmath99 is consistent with that of the @xmath28-wave polar state@xcite . for @xmath100 , the @xmath101 measurements of shivaram _ et .",

    "in this paper , we calculate @xmath77 for a ferromagnetic superconductor with @xmath5 and @xmath28-wave polar / cbs symmetry .",
    "since all three low - field @xmath74 curves for the rrr = 21 crystal of urhge have different slopes at @xmath102 , the simplest possible fs to consider is an ellipsoidal one , with @xmath103 , having three different single particle effective masses @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , appropriate for orthorhombic symmetry .",
