    "the interplay between mechanical and electronic effects in carbon nanostructures has been studied for a long time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanics in those studies invariably enters within the context of continuum elasticity .",
    "one of the most interesting predictions of the theory is the creation of large , and roughly uniform pseudo - magnetic fields and deformation potentials under strain conformations having a three - fold symmetry @xcite .",
    "those theoretical predictions have been successfully verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , different theoretical approaches to strain engineering in graphene possess subtle points and apparent discrepancies @xcite , which may hinder progress in the field .",
    "this motivated us to develop an approach @xcite which does not suffer from limitations inherent to continuum elasticity .",
    "this new formulation accommodates numerical verifications to determine when arbitrary mechanical deformations preserve sublattice symmetry .",
    "contrary to the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , with this formulation one can also demonstrate in an explicit manner the absence of @xmath3point dependent gauge fields on a first - order theory ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite as well ) .",
    "the formalism takes as its only direct input _",
    "atomistic data as the data obtained from molecular dynamics runs .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present the method , making the derivation manifest .",
    "we illustrate the formalism by computing the gauge fields and the density of states in a graphene membrane under central load .",
    "the theory of strain - engineered electronic effects in graphene is semi - classical .",
    "one seeks to determine the effects of mechanical strain across a graphene membrane in terms of spatially - modulated pseudospin hamiltonians @xmath4 ; these pseudospin hamiltonians @xmath5 are low - energy expansions of a hamiltonian formally defined in reciprocal space . under `` long range '' mechanical strain",
    "( extending over many unit cells and preserving sublattice symmetry @xcite ) @xmath4 also become continuous and slowly - varying local functions of strain - derived gauges , so that @xmath6 . within this first - order approach ,",
    "the salient effect of strain is a local shift of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points in opposite directions , similar to a shift induced by a magnetic field @xcite . in the usual formulation of the theory @xcite , this dependency on position leads to a _ continuous _ dependence of strain - induced fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "such continuous fields are customarily superimposed to a discrete lattice , as in figure [ fig : f1 ]  @xcite .",
    "when expressed in terms of continuous functions , a pseudospin hamiltonian @xmath4 is defined down to arbitrarily small spatial scales and it spans a zero area . in reality , however , the pseudospin hamiltonian can only be defined per unit cell , so it should take a single value at an area of order @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the lattice constant in the absence of strain ) .",
    "this observation tells us already that the scale of the mechanical deformation with respect to a given unit cell is inherently lost in a description based on a continuum model . for this reason ,",
    "it is important to develop an approach which is directly related to the atomic lattice , as opposed to its idealization as a continuum medium . in the present paper we show that in following this program one gains a deeper understanding of the interrelation between the mechanics and the electronic structure of graphene .",
    "indeed , within this approach we are able to quantitatively analyze whether the proper phase conjugation of the pseudospin hamiltonian holds at each unit cell .",
    "the approach presented here will give ( for the first time ) the possibility to explicitly check on any given graphene membrane under arbitrary strain if mechanical strain varies smoothly on the scale of interatomic distances .",
    "consistency in the present formalism will also lead to the conclusion that in such scenario strain will not break the sublattice symmetry but the dirac cones at the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points will be shifted in the opposite directions @xcite .",
    "clearly , for a reciprocal space to exist one has to preserve crystal symmetry , so that when crystal symmetry is strongly perturbed , the reciprocal space representation starts to lack physical meaning , presenting a limitation to the semiclassical theory .",
    "the lack of sublattice symmetry observed on actual unit cells on this formulation beyond first - order continuum elasticity may not allow proper phase conjugation of pseudospin hamiltonians at unit cells undergoing very large mechanical deformations .",
    "nevertheless this check can not proceed and hence has never been discussed on a description of the theory within a continuum media , because by construction there is no direct reference to actual atoms on a continuum .    as it is well - known",
    ", it is also possible to determine the electronic properties directly from a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath11 in real space , without resorting to the semiclassical approximation and without imposing an _ a priori _ sublattice symmetry .",
    "that is , while the semiclassical @xmath12 is defined in reciprocal space ( thus assuming some reasonable preservation of crystalline order ) , the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath11 in real space is more general and can be used for membranes with arbitrary spatial distribution and magnitude of the strain .",
    "in addition , contrary to the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite , the purported existence of @xmath3point dependent gauge fields does not hold on a first - order formalism @xcite .",
    "what we find instead , is a shift in opposite directions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points upon strain  @xcite .",
    "the continuum theories of strain engineering in graphene , being semiclassical in nature , require sublattice symmetry to hold @xcite .",
