    "the statistical properties of fluctuations in geomagnetic indices and their relation to those in the solar wind , is a topic of considerable interest ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "scaling has been identified as a key property of magnetospheric energy release in the form of bursty bulk flows in the magnetotail @xcite ,  blobs \" in the aurora @xcite , non - gaussian fluctuations in geomagnetic indices @xcite and in single station magnetometer data @xcite .",
    "models include self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) and multi - fractal models @xcite related to those of turbulence@xcite .",
    "these measures of scaling and non - gaussian fluctuations in magnetospheric output need to be understood in the context of the system s driver , the solar wind , which is turbulent and thus also scaling .",
    "other work has focussed on comparing properties of input parameters such as @xmath3 and the indices ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) to establish whether they are directly related .",
    "however , these studies have not provided a consistent answer . while @xcite found that both the @xmath3 and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 indices exhibited nearly identical scaling of burst lifetime probability density functions ( pdfs ) , @xcite obtained quite different scalings for @xmath0 and the solar wind quantity @xmath7 using spreading exponent methods motivated by soc .",
    "@xcite used a pdf rescaling technique to characterize the fluctuation pdf of @xmath8 years @xmath3 data from wind and a @xmath4 year data set of @xmath0 indices with fluctuations over a few standard deviations .",
    "direct comparison of the pdf s functional form suggested close similarity to within statistical error .",
    "in this paper we use a larger @xmath6-year data set for the @xmath0 indices to obtain a more accurate statistical determination of the functional form of the pdf of fluctuations over a more extensive dynamic range , including characterization of extremal events up to @xmath6 standard deviations for the first time .",
    "we apply structure functions to characterize and compare both the low and higher order moments for all quantities . a @xmath8-year subset of the index data , corresponding to the same period in the solar cycle as that used to produce @xmath3 , is used to facilitate this comparison .",
    "we then verify these results by direct examination of the fluctuation pdf using the full @xmath6-year @xmath0 indices dataset .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 index data sets investigated here comprise over @xmath9 million , @xmath4 minute averaged samples from january @xmath10 to december @xmath11 inclusive .",
    "the @xmath3 data set is identical to that used in @xcite and extends from january @xmath12 to december @xmath13 inclusive .",
    "it includes intervals of slow and fast speed streams .",
    "@xmath3 is defined ( see @xcite ) in si units as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and was calculated from the wind spacecraft key parameter database @xcite .",
    "the indices and @xmath3 are from different time intervals and here we assume statistical stability over these long time intervals .",
    "= 0.45    = 0.45",
    "generalized structure functions ( gsf ) , or generalized variograms , can be defined in terms of an average over time of a differenced variable @xmath17 as @xmath18 @xcite . if @xmath19 exhibits scaling with respect to @xmath20 , then @xmath21 . a log - log plot of @xmath22 versus @xmath20",
    "should then reveal a straight line for each @xmath23 with gradients @xmath24 . if @xmath25 ( @xmath26 constant ) then the time series is self - similar with single scaling exponent @xmath26 .    in order to compare the scaling properties of the non - contemporaneous @xmath3 and @xmath0 indices time series , we select a @xmath8-year subinterval @xmath27 from the @xmath0 indices at the same phase in the solar cycle as the @xmath3 data .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the second order gsfs as measured by the standard deviations @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] of the fluctuation @xmath29 .",
    "a scaling region is apparent between @xmath30 and @xmath31  s where @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hurst exponent [ @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 goodness of fit analysis was performed to select the optimal power law region and gradient and results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the upper limits of the scale regions @xmath36 are in good agreement with values reported previously @xcite .",
    "any such single estimate of the @xmath33 , whilst establishing the region of @xmath20 over which there is scaling , does not fully characterize the properties of the time series . for example , a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) can be constructed to share the same @xmath33 value as @xmath0 , but the fbm series has gaussian distributed increments @xmath19 by definition @xcite whereas those of @xmath0 are non - gaussian @xcite . as discussed by @xcite the similar values arise because @xmath33 aggregates _ two _ sources of scaling in monofractal random walks : persistence ( the  joseph \" effect ) and heavy tails in the increments ( the  noah \" effect ) . in the",
    "above example the anomalous value of @xmath33 for fbm comes just from the joseph effect , whilst for @xmath0 the noah effect must be at work .",
    "furthermore , estimating @xmath33 by only one method may not distinguish a fractal time series from a discontinuous one @xcite .",
    "we thus turn next to the higher order @xmath23 values of @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows scaling exponents @xmath24 derived from raw gsfs with @xmath23 varying between @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the @xmath39 and @xmath0 indices fluctuations .",
    "these suggest the departure of higher orders from self - similarity , i.e. , @xmath24 departs from a straight line .",
    "the inset of this figure shows the origin of these @xmath24 values for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "only the first four orders exhibit clear linear behavior expected in the scaling region . for higher orders ,",
    "the value of @xmath42 very strongly depends on the assumed extent of the scaling region to which one fits a straight line . in principle , @xmath24 can be obtained for any @xmath23 .",
    "however , errors do not contribute uniformly over @xmath23 , for example , the largest fluctuations that affect large @xmath23 , are statistically poorly resolved , whereas the smallest fluctuations ( @xmath43 ) are dominated by instrument thresholds . for the latter reason we will exclude @xmath44 for @xmath45 as @xmath46 is not well determined through its definition .    conditioned gsfs quantify the impact of intermittency on fluctuations of different sizes by imposing a threshold @xmath47 on the event size @xcite . here",
    ", this threshold will be based on the standard deviation of the differenced time series for a given @xmath20 , @xmath48 .",
    "this procedure allows us to exclude rare extreme fluctuations with large statistical errors which , for large @xmath23 , could lead to a spurious departure from self - similar behavior .",
    "alternatively , conditioning with different thresholds estimates a maximum size for the fluctuations for which self - similarity is still valid .",
    "following conditioning , log - log plots of @xmath49 show good correspondence with straight line fits , shown for @xmath40 in the inset of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "this power law dependence holds between times already obtained from the @xmath35 analysis performed for @xmath50 .",
    "the main plot then shows @xmath24 obtained from the conditioned @xmath49 .",
    "all lines in the figure were fitted for moments between @xmath37 ( @xmath51 for @xmath3 ) and @xmath52 and then extended to the entire range of data .",
    "scaling exponents obtained from this technique were unchanged for thresholds @xmath53 between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "firstly , our analysis suggests that the statistics of the fluctuations for all four quantities are self - similar for times between @xmath5 and @xmath56 minutes and fluctuations of size @xmath57 .",
    "secondly , the scaling exponent @xmath26 in @xmath25 that characterize this self - similar behavior , are identical within errors for fluctuations in the ae indices but different to that in @xmath3 at the @xmath58 level .",
    "scaling of the gsfs can be related to scaling properties of the fluctuation pdfs @xcite using the generic , model - independent rescaling method ( e.g. @xcite ) based on the rescaling of the pdfs @xmath59 of @xmath29 on different time scales @xmath20 .",
    "if a time series exhibits statistical self - similarity , a single argument representation of the pdf can be found that is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath26 is the rescaling exponent .",
    "we now express @xmath22 using the fluctuations pdf , @xmath59 as follows : @xmath61 expressing the integral in ( [ strpdf1 ] ) in terms of rescaled variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 shows that the scaling exponent @xmath24 is a linear function of @xmath23 , @xmath64 , for a statistically self - similar process , as suggested here by figure [ fig3 ] .    the exponent @xmath26 is ideally obtained from the scaling of the peaks of the pdf @xmath65 .",
    "however , the finite accuracy of the measurement may discretize the amplitude leading to errors in the peak values . table [ tab1 ] gives all scaling exponents , obtained by different methods .",
    "these yield consistent values of @xmath26 , to within the errors",
    ". we will use @xmath26 from the scaling of @xmath50 versus @xmath20 .",
    "if the fluctuations are statistically self - similar , as suggested by our gsf analysis , then the unscaled pdfs @xmath59 should collapse onto a single curve @xmath66 .",
    "we applied pdf rescaling to the fluctuation pdfs of all quantities and obtained satisfactory collapse of the curves within the scaling regions .",
    "the @xmath67 test applied to all quantities revealed that , for the scaling regions given above , the collapsed curves lie within @xmath68 error band .    .scaling indices derived from @xmath65 , @xmath50 and gsf power laws . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    figure [ fig4 ] shows the re - scaled fluctuation pdfs for the indices alone for @xmath69 min .",
    "the @xmath19 variable has been normalized to the rescaled standard deviation @xmath70 of @xmath62 in each case to facilitate this comparison .",
    "the inset of this figure shows the comparison for @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath71 fluctuations and these pdfs are nearly identical .",
    "these results are consistent with conclusions of the gsf analysis at the @xmath58 level .",
    "= 0.45    = 0.45    figure [ fig5 ] shows the normalized pdfs @xmath66 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 min overlaid on a single plot .",
    "we can clearly distinguish between the pdfs of the @xmath45 and @xmath0 indices fluctuations .",
    "we obtain the same result repeating this comparison for several values of @xmath20 , within the scaling range @xmath36 .",
    "we have also verified that the functional form of the pdf are insensitive to the solar cycle within errors .",
    "the use of a larger , @xmath6 year data set for the indices has reduced statistical scatter and expanded the dynamic range of the considered fluctuations as compared to the analysis given in @xcite , and would lead us to draw the opposite conclusion , that on time scales less than @xmath75 hour the @xmath0 index amplitude fluctuations are not driven linearly by those of the solar wind . we would also conclude that the difference seen at the @xmath58 level in the scaling of the @xmath3 and the indices is significant , even though they agree at the @xmath76 level @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have addressed an open question of the possible connection between the scaling properties of fluctuations in the solar wind driver and those observed in global measures of magnetospheric dynamics .",
    "we applied two statistical methods , generalized structure functions and pdf rescaling , to study the scaling of fluctuations in the @xmath3 parameter and the magnetospheric indices @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that , statistically , fluctuations in all four quantities are approximately self - similar when their size is limited to @xmath77 .",
    "this self - similarity extends to @xmath78 hours .",
    "the scaling exponents of the @xmath0 indices are close to each other and are appreciably different to that of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "the fluctuation pdfs of the @xmath0 indices , unlike that of @xmath45 , are asymmetric",
    ". direct comparison of the pdfs for the fluctuations in the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath71 index indicates that they are nearly identical . whilst the low frequency behavior of the solar wind and the indices may be well correlated @xcite , here",
    "we have concluded that , on time scales smaller than @xmath4 hour the properties of the fluctuations in the solar wind and the indices differ in _ both _ amplitude and persistence . if the underlying physical origin of the auroral scaling is turbulence , then different scaling behavior implies a different type of turbulence , i.e. , different dimensionality / topology or different relevant physics @xcite .",
    "if the underlying physics is soc or similar @xcite then similar conclusions would still be drawn ( c.f .",
    "however , at this point we also can not rule out the possibility that the way in which the indices are constructed  burns \" information still present in the magnetometer data about the solar wind scaling , here possibly by changing either or both of the degree of persistence ( power spectral slope ) and the heavy - tailed property ( see @xcite for a related preliminary investigation ) .",
