    "the mechanism of galaxy formation , as currently understood , involves the cooling and condensation of baryons inside the gravitational potential well provided by the dark matter ( dm ) ; in spirals , a rotationally supported disk is formed , whose structure is governed by angular momentum acquired through tidal interactions during the precollapse phase .    under the assumption of specific angular momentum conservation , that holds when the baryons and the dm are initially well mixed , the dynamics of the dark halo is directly related to the disk scale length ( see fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "this tight connection between halo dynamics and disk geometry is quantified by the spin parameter @xmath0 ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "the general procedure for the computation of the angular momentum has been described in detail by mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) ; it relies on @xmath2 basic assumptions : ( i ) the mass of the galactic disk is a universal fraction of the halo s ; ( ii ) the total angular momentum of the disk is also a fixed fraction of the halo s ; ( iii ) the disk is thin and centrifugally supported , with an exponential surface density profile .",
    "the theory is applied to a navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ; nfw ) dm potential .    in the present work , we propose to determine the angular momentum and the spin parameter of disk galaxies by making use of the observed matter distribution in spirals , and of observed scaling relations between halo and disk properties . for this purpose ,",
    "we adopt a modified set of assumptions : we relax ( i ) , and use instead an empirical relation that links the disk mass to that of its dm halo ( shankar et al .",
    "2005 ) ; we retain ( ii ) and suppose total specific angular momentum conservation during the disk formation , i.e. , @xmath3 in terms of the disk and halo masses @xmath4 , @xmath5 and of the related total angular momenta @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; as to ( iii ) , we still assume that the disk is centrifugally supported , stable , and distributed according to an exponential surface density profile , but we also take into account the gaseous ( hi+he ) component .",
    "finally , we perform the computation for a burkert halo .    we adopt a flat cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath8 and hubble constant @xmath9 . given a halo with mass @xmath5",
    "we determine its radius as @xmath10 @xmath11^{1/3}$ ] ; here @xmath12 is the critical density , @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 are the density parameter and the density contrast at redshift @xmath15 ; @xmath16 holds at @xmath17 .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the stellar disk and halo mass distributions can be obtained straightforwardly by means of three observational scaling relations , linking the disk mass to the halo mass , to the halo central density , and to the disk scale length .",
    "the total mass of the stellar disk @xmath4 that resides in a halo of mass @xmath5 is given by the relation ( shankar et al .",
    "2005 ) : @xmath18 this holds for halo masses between @xmath19 and about @xmath20 , wide enough to include most of the spiral population , except dwarfs .",
    "this relation has been derived by the statistical comparison of the galactic halo mass function with the stellar mass function ; the related uncertainty is around @xmath21 , mainly due to the mass to light ratio used to derive the stellar mass function from the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "we model the stellar disk with a thin , exponential surface density profile of the form @xmath22 the characteristic scale - length @xmath23 is estimated through : @xmath24 this relation is inferred from dynamical mass determinations by persic et al .",
    "these scale lengths are consistent with the data by dale et al .",

    "( 1999 ) , and courteau et al .",

    ", we adopt a burkert distribution @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the core radius and @xmath27 the effective core density .",
    "correspondingly , the total halo mass inside the radius @xmath28 is given by @xmath29~ , \\label{mass}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 being the mass contained inside the radius @xmath26 .",
    "the density @xmath27 is determined from the disk mass through the relation obtained from the universal rotation curve ( burkert & salucci 2000 ) : @xmath31 for each given virial mass @xmath32 ( corresponding to a radius @xmath33 ) we find the density @xmath27 through eqs .",
    "( [ mvirmd ] ) and ( [ rhomd ] ) ; then we numerically compute the core radius @xmath26 by requiring that the mass @xmath34 inside @xmath33 given by r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) equals the virial mass @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting relation @xmath26 vs. @xmath32 is approximated within a few percents by the relation @xmath35 such values of @xmath26 obtained by assuming a mass model out to @xmath33 are consistent with those estimated by burkert & salucci ( 2000 ) from the decomposition of the inner rotation curves .",
    "the total circular velocity of the disk system is @xmath36 . for a thin , centrifugally supported disk",
    "the circular velocity is given by @xmath37 @xmath38 ; here @xmath39 and the quantity @xmath40 is a combination of the modified bessel functions that accounts for the disk asphericity .",
    "moreover , the halo circular velocity is simply @xmath41 , and it is useful to define @xmath42 . given the relations ( [ mvirmd ] ) , ( [ mdrd ] ) , ( [ rhomd ] ) and ( [ r0mh ] ) linking the basic quantities of the system , the shape and amplitude of the velocity profile depend only on the halo mass .",
    "note that the uncertainties on these relations combine to give a @xmath43 uncertainty on the determination of the velocity profile ( see tonini & salucci 2004 ) .    in order to check our mass model and empirical scaling relations ,",
    "we compute the i - band tully - fisher relation at @xmath44 .",
    "we obtain the b - band luminosity from the stellar disk mass through the relation @xmath45 by shankar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , then convert the related magnitude in i - band through the mean colour @xmath46 ( fukugita et al .",

    "( right ) we compare the result with the data by giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , finding an excellent agreement .",
    "we compute the angular momentum of the disk as @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath39 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath6 depends linearly both on the mass and on the radial extension of the disk , while the dm distribution enters the computation through the integrated velocity profile , encased into the shape factor @xmath50 ; the latter slowly varies ( by a factor @xmath51 at most ) throughout our range of halo masses .    in figure 1 ( left )",
    "we show the specific angular momentum of the disk vs. the total circular velocity at @xmath52 , computed as @xmath53 from eq .",
    "( [ jd ] ) . plotted for comparison is also the best - fit relation by navarro & steinmetz ( 2000 ) from their collection of data ; note that these authors adopted a flat rotation curve , so that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we derive the halo angular momentum by assuming the conservation of the total specific angular momentum between dm and baryons : @xmath56 an _ ansatz _ widely supported / adopted in the literature ( mo et al .",
    "1998 ; van den bosch et al . 2001 , 2002 ; burkert & d onghia 2004 ; peirani et al .",
    "note that small variations of @xmath6 are magnified by a factor @xmath57 in the value of @xmath7 , i.e. , the latter is rather sensitive to the radial extension of the baryons .",
    "we now consider , along with the stars , the gaseous component that envelops the disk of spiral galaxies .",
    "we derive the total mass of the gas component from the disk luminosity ( see above ) through the relation @xmath58~ \\label{mgas}\\ ] ] by persic & salucci ( 1999 ) , where we have included a factor @xmath59 to account for the he abundance .",
    "since the gas mass is on average much less than the halo mass , both the total mass and the rotation curve remain virtually unaltered ( @xmath60 ) by the presence of the gaseous component .",
    "however , the gas is much more diffuse than the stars , reaching out several disk scale lengths ( corbelli & salucci 2000 ; dame 1993 ) ; since most of the angular momentum comes from material at large radial distances ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2001 ) , we expect the gas to add a significant contribution to the total angular momentum ( eq .",
    "[ [ jd ] ] ) , especially in small spirals where the gas to baryon fraction is close to @xmath61 .",
    "the detailed density profile of the gas in spirals is still under debate in the literature .",
    "however , we are confident that the main factors entering the computation of the gas angular momentum @xmath62 are just the gas total mass @xmath63 and the radial extension of its distribution ; in other words , we expect that the details of the gas profile do not significantly affect the results . in order to check this statement",
    ", we considered @xmath2 different gas models , _",
    "i.e. _ ( i ) a disk - like distribution ( dl ) , with scale length @xmath64 ; ( ii ) a uniform distribution ( u ) out to a radius @xmath65 ; and ( iii ) an @xmath66-like gaussian distribution ( m33 ; corbelli & salucci 2000 ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 in the second equation is the heaviside step function . as fiducial values of the parameters , we adopt @xmath69 in the first expression , @xmath70 in the second one ( dame 1993 ) , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 in the last one ( corbelli & salucci 2000 ) .",
    "each profile has been normalized to the total gas mass @xmath63 as computed from eq .",
    "( [ mgas ] ) .    in parallel with eq .",
    "( [ jd ] ) , the gas angular momentum will be @xmath73 where the shape parameter @xmath74 encodes the specific gas distribution .",
    "on comparing its values for the three models we find differences of less than @xmath75 , and so confidently choose the gaussian profile as a baseline .",
    "we then compute the halo angular momentum as a function of the total baryonic one : @xmath76 the gas is dynamically affecting the system mainly through its different spatial distribution with respect to that of the stars , adding an angular momentum component that is significant at large radii compared to @xmath23 .",
    "note that we do not include a bulge component , since it would contribute a negligible angular momentum and a mass of @xmath77 at most ; in any case , this would slightly lower @xmath7 after eq .",
    "( [ tothaloangmom ] ) and , as will be evident in the next section , would lower the spin parameter and strengthen our conclusions .",
    "the spin parameter is a powerful tool to investigate galaxy formation , as it is strictly related to both the dynamics and the geometry of the system .",
    "we compute its values and distribution function based on the results of section 2 .",
    "the spin parameter is defined as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath80 is the total energy of the halo . the latter is computed as @xmath81 after the virial theorem , and having supposed that all the dm particles orbit on circular tracks .",
    "bullock et al . ( 2001 ) proposed the alternative definition @xmath82 where the second equality holds after eq .",
    "( [ tothaloangmom ] ) .",
    "we find that for burkert halos the ratio @xmath83 is between @xmath84 in the mass range @xmath85 . in figure 2 ( top panels ) we plot both @xmath0 and @xmath86 as a function of the halo mass .",
    "we highlight the difference in the value of the spin parameter when the gas component is included , especially in low mass halos .    to compute the probability distributions @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the spin parameters , we make use of the galactic halo mass function , i.e. , the number density of halos with mass @xmath5 containing a single baryonic core , as derived by shankar et al .",
    "a good fit is provided by the schechter function @xmath89 with parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 mpc@xmath93 ; note that within our range of halo masses , this is mostly contributed by spirals .",
    "for the computation of @xmath87 or @xmath88 , we randomly picked up a large sample of masses distributed according to @xmath94 , then compute @xmath0 or @xmath86 for each using eqs .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ lambdap ] ) , and eventually build up the statistical distributions . during this procedure",
    "we have convolved the relations ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ lambdap ] ) with a gaussian scatter of @xmath95 dex that takes into account the statistical uncertainties in the empirical scaling laws we adopt ; these are mostly due to the determination of @xmath23 through eq .",
    "( [ mdrd ] ) , for which we have determined the scatter by using the disk mass estimates of individual spirals reported in persic & salucci ( 1990 ) .    as shown in figure 2 ( bottom panels ) , we find a distribution peaked around a value of about @xmath1 for @xmath0 and about @xmath96 for @xmath86 , when the gas is considered .",
    "we stress that this value of @xmath86 is close to the result of the simulations by donghia & burkert ( 2004 ) , who on average find @xmath97 for spirals quietly evolving ( i.e. , experiencing no major mergers ) since @xmath98 , see their figure 4 .",
    "in addition , burkert & donghia ( 2005 ) argue that this value of @xmath86 provides a very good fit to the observed relation between the disk scale length and the maximum rotation velocity ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "we also stress that our most probable value for @xmath0 is in agreement with the results by gardner ( 2001 ) , vitvitska et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and peirani et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find a peak value of the distribution function at around @xmath1 for halos that evolved mainly through smooth accretion .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have computed the angular momentum , the spin parameter and the related distribution function for dm halos hosting a spiral galaxy .",
    "we have relied on observed scaling relations linking the properties of the baryons to those of their host halos , and have assumed the same total specific angular momentum for the dm and the baryons .",
    "our main findings are : ( i ) we show that including the gas component beside the stars has a remarkable impact on the total angular momentum ; ( ii ) by adopting for the dm the observationally supported burkert profile , we compute the total angular momentum of the disk and its relationship with the rotation velocity ; ( iii ) we obtain @xmath99 and @xmath100 as most - probable values of the spin parameters .    simulations based on the @xmath101cdm framework , performed by various authors ( bullock et al . 2001 ; donghia & burkert 2004 ) , have shown that the distribution of the spin parameter @xmath86 for the whole halo catalogue peaks at around @xmath102 , significantly higher than our empirical value .",
    "however , donghia & burkert ( 2004 ) highlight that if one restricts one s attention to halos that hosts spirals and have not experienced major mergers during the late stages of their evolution ( @xmath103 ) , the average spin parameter @xmath86 turns out to be around @xmath104 , very close to our observational result .",
    "moreover , gardner ( 2001 ) and peirani et al . ( 2004 ) showed that the spin parameter @xmath0 undergoes different evolutions in halos that have grown up mainly through major mergers or smooth accretion : in the former case @xmath0 takes on values around @xmath105 , while in the latter case @xmath0 has lower values around @xmath1 ."
