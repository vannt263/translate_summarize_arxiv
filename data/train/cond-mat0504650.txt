    "this well known model is given by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 creates an electron on site @xmath6 with spin @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a nearest neighbor of @xmath6 .",
    "this model contains both the movement of the electrons ( hopping ) ( @xmath9 , kinetic energy ) and the interactions of the electrons if they are on the same site ( @xmath10 , potential energy ) .",
    "the hubbard model is one of the simplest possible models of interacting electrons . in the large @xmath11 limit",
    ", the model reduces to the well known @xmath12 model @xmath13 and the now constrained fermion operators @xmath14 obey the constraint of no double occupancy at any site @xmath15 ( @xmath16 has expectation values 0 or 1 ) . in formal terms , the fock space is projected to this sector adhering to these constraints .",
    "an even simpler version is afforded by the so - called @xmath1 model given by @xmath17 wherein the @xmath18 spin symmetry of the original hubbard and @xmath12 models has been lifted .",
    "numerical calculations on such models with open and cylindrical boundary conditions have found non - uniform `` stripe '' patterns @xcite which have earlier been predicted by approximate solutions to the hubbard model @xcite , and derived , very convincingly , by the addition of the strong coulomb effects present in the cuprates @xcite . at the moment , there is no clear consensus as to whether these patterns display the genuine ground state of the bare hubbard ( or @xmath12 ) hamiltonian or amount to a finite - size artifact .",
    "attacking these models has proven not to be an easy task .",
    "the hilbert space of the model is too large for exact numerical solutions .",
    "monte carlo simulations suffer from the sign problem .",

    "as has been emphasized by @xcite , coulomb repulsions in the cuprates are poorly screened and universally promote the existence of stripes .",
    "notwithstanding , it would be of interest to attain rigorous results on whether various inhomogeneous electronic patterns can , in principle , be realized in the presence of short - range interactions and hopping alone in some models .",
    "the less ambitious goal of this article is not directly related to the very challenging endeavor of understanding such complicated systems ( albeit motivated by it ) .",
