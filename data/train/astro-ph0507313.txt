    "the rotation law in the infinite ( in axial direction ) taylor - couette flow is @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to the angular velocities @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the inner and the outer cylinders .",
    "the rotation laws with @xmath7 are called as located at the rayleigh line . with @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the radii of the cylinders",
    "the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the flow are defined . according to the rayleigh criterion",
    "the ideal flow is hydrodynamically stable when the specific angular momentum increases outwards , i.e. @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the viscosity , however , stabilizes the flow so that it becomes unstable only if the inner cylinder rotates sufficiently fast .    if the fluid is electrically conducting and an axial magnetic field is applied then after the old results the critical reynolds number ( for the inner rotating cylinder ) grows with growing magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig71c ] shows the theoretical results of chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) for narrow gaps and very small magnetic prandtl numbers , @xmath14 , together with the experimental data for mercury of donnelly & ozima ( 1960 ) .",
    "theory and observations are in nearly perfect agreement with no indication of any magnetic - induced instability .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number under laboratory conditions is really very small ( @xmath15 for liquid sodium ) .    within the small - gap approximation but with free pm kurzweg ( 1963 ) found that for _ weak _ magnetic fields and sufficiently large magnetic prandtl number the critical taylor number becomes _ smaller _ than in the hydrodynamic case ( fig .",
    "[ fig71b ] ) .",
    "if the field is not too strong it can basically play a destabilizing role .",
    "velikhov ( 1959 ) originally discovered this magnetic shear - flow instability which is now called ` magnetorotational instability ' ( mri ) .",
    "he found that for the ideal hydromagnetic taylor - couette flow the rayleigh criterion for stability changes to @xmath16 i.e. only flows with superrotation are still stable .",
    "he found a growth rate along the rayleigh line ( i.e. @xmath7 ) of @xmath17 and a critical wave number of k2 , [ veli ] with @xmath18 the alfvn velocity of the given axial field .",
    "only if @xmath18 is _ smaller _ than the shear @xmath19 the instability works which , therefore , is a weak - field instability .",
    "the hydrodynamic taylor - couette flow is stable if its angular momentum increases with radius , but the hydromagnetic taylor - couette flow is only stable if the angular velocity itself increases with radius .",
    "this remains true also for nonideal fluids .",
    "the mri reduces the critical reynolds number for weak magnetic field strengths for hydrodynamically unstable flow and it destabilizes the otherwise hydrodynamically stable flow for @xmath20 the mri exists , however , in hydrodynamically unstable situations ( @xmath21 ) only if pm is not very small ( fig .",
    "[ fig71b ] ) .    as we shall demonstrate the magnetic reynolds number rm = re  pm [ rm ] controls the instability .",
    "because of the high value of @xmath22 for liquid metals ( exceeding 1000  @xmath23/s ) , it is not easy to reach magnetic reynolds numbers of the required order of @xmath24 .",
    "this is the basic reason why the mri has not yet been observed experimentally in the laboratory .",
    "critical taylor number as a function of the magnetic prandtl number for strong and weak magnetic fields within the small - gap approximation . for weak fields and large magnetic prandtl numbers",

    "the reynolds number is usually defined as @xmath28 .",
    "the amplitude of the external magnetic field @xmath29 is expressed with the hartmann number @xmath30 .",
    "the values of the reynolds numbers above which the flow becomes unstable depend on the vertical wave number .",
    "they have a minimum at some wave number for fixed other parameters .",
    "this minimum value is called the critical reynolds number .",
    "figure  [ fig73a ] shows the neutral stability for axisymmetric modes for containers with both conducting and insulating walls with resting outer cylinder and for fluids of various magnetic prandtl number .",
    "@xmath31 is the classical hydrodynamic solution for resting outer cylinder and @xmath32 .",
    "there is a strong difference of the bifurcation lines for @xmath33 ( high conductivity ) and @xmath34 ( low conductivity ) . for fluids with low electrical conductivity the magnetic field only suppresses the instability so that all the critical reynolds numbers strongly exceed the value 68 .    for small magnetic prandtl number",
    "the stability lines hardly differ .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ fig73a ] the resulting critical reynolds numbers re are smaller than 68 .",
    "the magnetic fields with small hartmann numbers support the instability rather than to suppress it .",
    "this effect becomes more effective for increasing pm but it vanishes for stronger magnetic fields .",
    "the mri only exists for weak magnetic fields and high enough electrical conductivity and/or microscopic viscosity .",
    "now the outer cylinder may rotate so fast that the rotation law no longer fulfills the rayleigh criterion and a solution for @xmath35 does not exist .",
    "the nonmagnetic eigenvalue along the vertical axis moves to infinity but _ a minimum remains_. figure  [ fig73aa ] presents the results for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "in the presence of the hall effect there is even the possibility that differential rotation with @xmath41 increasing outwards ( i.e. @xmath42 ) becomes unstable .",
    "the hall effect destabilizes flows with @xmath43 for which so far no other instability is known .",
    "the dispersion relation derived from the equation system with an induction equation including hall effect leads to the instability condition @xmath44 with rb as the ratio of the ohmic time scale and the hall time scale .",

    "the flow with @xmath45 is unstable for positive rb .",
    "flows with @xmath46 are unstable for negative rb , i.e. if angular velocity and magnetic field have opposite directions . the fact that the hall effect destabilizes flows with the angular velocity increasing outwards was first described by balbus and terquem ( 2001 ) .",
    "figure  [ hall1 ] may only serve as an illustration .",
    "in particular for @xmath45 the situation is more complicated as simultaneously the mri is active .",
    "one finds more details in the original paper of rdiger & shalybkov ( 2004 ) about the overall impact of the hall effect on the taylor - couette flow .",
    "that the _ sign _ of the magnetic field has such an important influence on stability or instability of flows ( e.g. kepler flows ) must have important consequences for astrophysical applications .",
    "it is also important to know the nonaxisymmetric modes .",
    "after the cowling theorem only nonaxisymmetric modes can be maintained by a dynamo process .",
    "we have discussed the appearance of nonaxisymmetric modes for the magnetic taylor - couette flow with negative shear ( shalybkov , rdiger & schultz 2002 ) .",
    "the common result was that the lines of marginal stability for @xmath47 and @xmath48 have a very different behavior for different electrical boundary conditions .",
    "one finds crossovers of the stability lines for containers with conducting cylinder walls , and one never finds crossovers for containers with vacuum boundary conditions .",
    "the same happens for the hall instability for magnetic taylor - couette flows with @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ nonaxi ] the lines for both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes are given for conducting boundary conditions and for vacuum boundary conditions . indeed , a crossover of the lines only exists for conducting cylinder walls . as usual , in the minimum the @xmath47 mode dominates but for stronger magnetic fields the mode with @xmath48 dominates .",
    "the hydrodynamic taylor - couette flow stability is now discussed under the presence of vertical density stratifications .",
    "taylor - couette flows with a stable axial density stratification were often studied with the conclusion that a stable stratification stabilizes the flow .",
    "withjack & chen ( 1974 ) , however , reported new experiments with the rayleigh line at @xmath50 . for a slight negative density gradient disturbances of spiral form",
    "were observed for @xmath51 , i.e. clearly beyond the rayleigh line .",
    "recently , yavneh , mcwilliams & molemaker ( 2001 ) find that the sufficient condition for stability against nonaxisymmetric disturbances is the same as the condition for mri .",
    "their numerical results demonstrated that certain instabilities exist also for finite viscosity .",
    "one has to look for the basic state with prescribed velocity profile and given density vertical stratification @xmath52 .",
    "the initial system then can only exist if r^2 + g = 0 .",
    "[ cond1 ] is fulfilled . under the centrifugal force",
    "the purely vertical stratification at the beginning transforms to a mixed vertical and radial stratification .",
    "this behavior strongly complicates the problem .    in real experiments",
    "the initial vertical stratification is so small that @xmath53 . then after ( [ cond1 ] ) the radial stratification is also small .",
    "let us , therefore , consider the ` small - stratification case ' with @xmath54 with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the uniform background density and condition ( [ cond1 ] ) is fulfilled at zero order . if only the terms of the zero order are considered then the system takes the boussinesq form .",
    "@xmath57 is the vertical brunt - visl frequency @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the froude number .",
    "here we suppose @xmath60 so that the coefficients of the system only depend on the radial coordinate and a normal mode expansion @xmath61 is possible . as usual ,",
    "only those wave numbers are considered which belong to the smallest reynolds numbers .",
    "we have also checked the existence of the transition from stable to unstable state for some arbitrary points .",

    "the axisymmetric disturbances are unstable only for @xmath21 in accordance to the rayleigh condition .",
    "the new nonaxisymmetric disturbances are also unstable in the interval @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of the outer limit @xmath64 is a new and surprising finding .",
    "even more flat rotation laws with @xmath65 are still stable ( shalybkov & rdiger 2005 )",
    ".    for @xmath63 the vertical wave number only slightly depends on @xmath66 ( fig .",
