    "heavy quarks are sensitive probes of the medium produced in the collision as they are produced in the early times and may lose energy when traversing the medium . at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , a significant suppression of electrons from heavy quarks at mid - rapidity has been observed in central auau collisions , indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks@xcite . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the c.m .",
    "energy of pbpb collision is 5.5@xmath2tev per nucleon - nucleon collision , about 30 times larger than that at rhic and it is expected that heavy flavors will be abundantly produced , offering a good opportunity to characterize the medium formed in the collision .",
    "heavy quark decays are expected to dominate the lepton - pair continuum up to the mass of the @xmath3  @xcite and the transverse momentum spectra of single muons up to 30 gev@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the spectra could be altered by the energy loss of heavy quarks@xcite . at the same time",
    ", this high amount of energy in the center of mass enables the possibility to create the w bosons in the initial hard scattering .",
    "as the muons from w decay are not effected by the medium formed in the collision , it is interesting to see how much the energy loss of heavy quarks affects on the muon production by using the muons from w as a reference .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the effect of heavy quarks energy loss on the transverse momentum spectra of single muons in pbpb collisions at @xmath5 in the acceptance of alice muon spectrometer@xcite .",
    "first , by introducing the nuclear shadowing effect and @xmath6 broadening in the hvqmnr program@xcite , which provides a fully exclusive partonic differential cross section calculation including all the relevant partonic subprocesses , we calculate the kinematic distributions of heavy quarks per nucleon - nucleon collision in pbpb collisions at @xmath5 .",
    "then , to sample the energy loss of heavy quarks , we use the collision geometry and the bdmps quenching weights for massive case@xcite with a scaling of the transport coefficient as a function of the pseudo - rapidity .",
    "finally we give the results of the transverse momentum spectra of single muons within the acceptance of alice muon spectrometer .",
    "in the hvqmnr program , the heavy quark hard production cross section is calculated in pqcd according to the factorization theorem : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fractorization scale , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the parton distribution functions , the differential probabilities for the partons @xmath11 and @xmath12 to carry momentum fractions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of their respective protons @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the total partonic cross section @xmath17 of the process @xmath18 at parton - parton c.m .",
    "energy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the c.m .",
    "energy of the pp collision , is calculated as a perturbation series in @xmath21 , where the strong coupling constant is evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath22 .    in the present calculation ,",
    "cteq 4 m parton distributions@xcite are used and nuclear shadowing is taken into account by using the eks98 parameterization@xcite .",
    "the parameters of hvqmnr program are set as : for charm , @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 , for beauty , @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "calculations are performed up to next leading order ( nlo ) with the hvqmnr program .",
    "for modelling the energy loss of heavy quarks , we used the quenching weights in the multiple soft scattering approximation , which were derived in ref.@xcite in the framework of the bdmps formalism@xcite .",
    "the energy loss @xmath28 is sampled by implementing the collision geometry and the quenching weights as explained in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the transport coefficient @xmath29 mentioned in the ref.@xcite is only applied for the central rapidity region .",
    "the decreased medium density in the forward rapidity region should be taken into account .",
    "we assume the scaling @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pseudo - rapidity distribution of charge particles predicted in ref.@xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum of the quark in the medium is reduced to @xmath32 , while the rapidity is kept unchanged .",
    "heavy quarks that lose most of their energy due to medium effects are redistributed according to a thermal distribution@xcite , @xmath33 where we choose @xmath34@xcite .",
    "the hadronization of heavy quarks is assumed to follow the peterson fragmentation function@xcite , @xmath35 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the fraction of heavy quark momentum carried by the final state hadron .",
    "@xmath37 is a parameter for the fragmentation , @xmath38 for charm and @xmath39 for beauty are used here@xcite .",
    "heavy mesons produced after the fragmentation decay semileptonically . in the spectator model , the heavy quark in a meson is considered to be independent of the light quark and allowed to decay as a free particle with the simple v - a weak current@xcite .",
    "thus , we considered heavy quark three - body - decay(@xmath40 and @xmath41 ) into muons instead of heavy meson decays into muons .",
    "the decays are calculated in the rest frame of the heavy quark and then boosted back according to the heavy quark momentum to obtain the kinematic distributions of muons@xcite .",
    "fig . [ compare ] shows the transverse momentum distribution of single muons from heavy quarks in pp collisions at @xmath42tev obtained from pythia@xcite simulations(pythia has been tuned to reproduce the kinematic distribution of heavy quarks produced by the hvqmnr program with parameter setting described in section 2 ) and our fast simulation composed of the hvqmnr program , peterson fragmentation and the spectator model(mentioned in the section [ decay ] ) .",
    "@xmath6 broadening and nuclear shadowing are included . in fig .",
    "[ compare ] the left plot is without any cuts and the right one is within the acceptance of the alice muon spectrometer(@xmath43 ) .",
    "muons from the decay @xmath44 are not included .",
    "the fast simulation gives transverse momentum distributions of single muons from heavy quarks close to those obtained from pythia@xcite .    to see how much the transport coefficient @xmath1 scaling ( formula ( 2 ) ) affects the energy loss of heavy quarks , nuclear modification factors for different values of @xmath29 with / without @xmath1 scaling",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the left plot and right plot are for beauty and charm , respectively . from fig .",
    "[ qraa ] , we can get that the decreased energy density in the forward rapidity region makes very small effects on the energy loss of heavy quarks .",
    "[ ptmuonall ] presents the transverse momentum spectra of single muons in central(0 - 5% ) pbpb collisions at @xmath42tev within the acceptance of alice muon spectrometer(@xmath45 ) .",
    "the @xmath46 spectra of all muons and the muons from w are obtained from ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 spectra of the muons from heavy quarks are obtained by the fast simulation .",
    "the values of @xmath47 are set to be 25 , 100 gev@xmath48/fm@xcite . as the muons from w bosons are not effected by the medium formed in the collision , they can be used as a reference to quantify the effect of heavy quark energy loss on the single muon production . from fig .",
    "[ ptmuonall ] , we can see that when energy loss is applied to heavy quarks , the crossing points of the @xmath46 spectra of single muons from heavy quarks and from w are shifted to the lower @xmath46(when @xmath49/fm , for beauty , the crossing point is shifted from 23 to about 17 gev@xmath4 , for charm , it is shifted from 18 to about 12 gev@xmath4 ) .",
    "we obtain similar @xmath46 spectra of single muons from a fast simulation(composed of the hvqmnr program , peterson fragmentation and the spectator model ) and from pythia generator . accounting for the decrease of the medium density in the forward rapidity region , we assume a @xmath1 scaling to @xmath29 and we find that the decreased energy density in the forward rapidity region makes small effects on the energy loss of heavy quarks .",
    "the energy loss of heavy quarks causes the crossing points in @xmath46 spectra of single muons from heavy quarks and from w bosons shift to lower @xmath46 .",
