    "the coupled diffusions can be considered as modeling population growth in a random , quickly changing environment at each spatial location , and with migration between locations . consider a population of many small particles living on the sites of @xmath1 .",
    "there are three forces acting upon this system :    each particle at time @xmath14 and lattice site @xmath15 independently duplicates itself at rate @xmath16 ;    each particle at time @xmath14 and lattice site @xmath15 independently dies at rate @xmath17 ;    each particle at time @xmath14 and lattice site @xmath15 independently jumps to a neighboring site @xmath18 with rate @xmath19 and @xmath20 with rate @xmath21",

    "the delta function initial data translates into starting with all the particles clustered at the origin and then allowing them to spread over time .    as explained in @xcite , it is of physical interest for these models to understand the structure of regions in space  time in which the population size is significantly larger than expected .",

    "intermittency_. generally , one seeks to measure the effect of changing various parameters with respect to this phenomenon .",
    "of specific interest are the spatial dimension ( replacing @xmath1 by  @xmath27 ) , the strength of @xmath26 , and the type of environmental noise ( replacing space  time noise by spatially varying but constant in time noise , or noise which is itself built out of interacting particle systems ) ; see part  i of @xcite and @xcite for reviews of these various directions . in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourself to the one - dimensional , space  time independent case and offer a new approach to computing the moments of this model . section  [ sec12 ] below explains the relevance of the moments to the intermittency phenomenon .      closely related to the above branching diffusion representation , the feynman ",

    "we write @xmath35 for the expectation over the disorder .",
    "the polymer measure on paths @xmath36 is defined as the argument of the above expectation , normalized by @xmath28 .",
    "directed polymer models are important from a number of perspectives ; see and references therein .",
    "they were introduced to study the domain walls of ising models with impurities at high temperature and have been applied to other problems like vortices in superconductors , roughness of crack interfaces , burgers turbulence , and interfaces in competing bacterial colonies .",
    "they also provide a unified mathematical framework for studying a variety of different abstract and physical problems including some in stochastic optimization , bio - statistics , queuing theory and operations research , interacting particle systems and random growth models .",

    "yor @xcite .",
    "the primary interest in the study of directed polymers is to understand the free energy fluctuations [ i.e. , @xmath39 and the transversal path fluctuations of the polymer measure under the limit at @xmath14 and @xmath15 go to infinity . for the special @xmath37 and @xmath38 case , there has been significant progress in both of these directions coming from the work of .",

    "we , however , consider initial data in which @xmath54 , and hence the exponents will depend on the velocity @xmath49 nontrivially .",
    "a parabolic anderson model shows intermittency if the lypanov exponents are strictly ordered as @xmath55    the weak ordering of exponents is a consequence of jensen s inequality ( for the first inequality ) and hlder s inequality ( for all subsequent inequalities ) .",
    "a useful fact is recorded in the following ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem iii.1.2 ) :    [ inter ] if for any @xmath56 , @xmath57 then for all @xmath58 @xmath59    as explained in @xcite , intermittent random fields are distinguished by the formation of strong pronounced spatial structures such as sharp peaks which give the main contribution to the physical processes in such media .",
    "a popular example cited therein is the observation of zeldovich that the solar magnetic field is intermittent since more than 99@xmath60 of the magnetic energy concentrates on less than 1@xmath60 of the surface area .",
    "the above mathematical definition of intermittency is related to the presence of high peaks of @xmath28 that dominate large time moment asymptotics . in particular , fix @xmath61 such that @xmath62 ; then we know that @xmath63 as @xmath64 . writing @xmath65 \\\\ & & \\qquad   = \\mathbb{e } \\bigl [ z_{\\beta } \\bigl(t,\\lfloor \\nu t \\rfloor \\bigr)^{k+1}\\mathbf{1}_{z_{\\beta } ( t,\\lfloor\\nu t\\rfloor)<e^{\\alpha t } } \\bigr ] + \\mathbb{e } \\bigl [ z_{\\beta } \\bigl(t,\\lfloor\\nu t\\rfloor \\bigr)^{k+1 } \\mathbf{1}_{z_{\\beta}(t,\\lfloor\\nu t\\rfloor)>e^{\\alpha t } } \\bigr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe that the first term is , but the sum of the two is asymptotically @xmath66 , which is exponentially ( as @xmath14 grows ) larger than @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the event @xmath68 gives overwhelming contribution to the @xmath69st moment . on the other hand , @xmath70 \\geq e^{\\alpha k t } \\mathbb{p } \\bigl ( z_{\\beta } \\bigl(t,\\lfloor\\nu t \\rfloor \\bigr ) > e^{\\alpha t } \\bigr)\\ ] ] and hence , for large @xmath14 @xmath71 which is exponentially small .",
    "in the case of spatially translation invariant ergodic solutions @xmath28 , the consequences of intermittency may be interpreted via spatial averages over large balls at a fixed ( large ) time .",
    "thus one can talk about islands where the solution is at least @xmath72 ( as opposed to the typical value of @xmath73 ) whose spatial density is not more than @xmath74 .",
    "our results are for delta initial data @xmath75 and not stationary initial data .    in terms of the population model interpretation of @xmath28",
    ", the above discussion implies that knowledge of the lyaponov exponents translates into detailed information about the spatial frequency of large clusters of population growth in space .    in this direction ,",
    "the primary contribution of this paper is the precise calculation of the first two moment lyapunov exponents for the general @xmath40 model and the calculation of all moment lyapunov exponents for the special @xmath37 and @xmath38 case . from the above considerations , this provides detailed information about the intermittent structure of the corresponding population growth models .",
