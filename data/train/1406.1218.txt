    "<S> we used density functional and many - body perturbation theory to calculate the quasiparticle band structures and electronic transport parameters of p - type snse both for the low - temperature _ pnma _ and high - temperature _ cmcm _ phases . </S>",
    "<S> the _ pnma _ </S>",
    "<S> phase has an indirect band gap of 0.829 ev while the _ cmcm _ has a direct band gap of 0.464 ev . </S>",
    "<S> both phases exhibit multiple local band extrema within an energy range comparable to the thermal energy of carriers from the global extrema . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the electronic transport coefficients for single - crystal and polycrystalline materials to understand previous experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the dependence of the transport coefficients on doping concentration and temperature to identify doping conditions for optimal thermoelectric performance . </S>"
