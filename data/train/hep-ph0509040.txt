    "the unique and stable ` double heavy - flavored ' meson , @xmath5 , has been confirmed in experiment @xcite , and the observations are consistent with the theoretical expectations within theoretical uncertainties and experimental errors . in view of the prospects of @xmath5 production at fermilab tevatron ( run - ii ) and at lhc ,",
    "the @xmath5 physics is compelling .",
    "the future copious data require more accurate theoretical predictions , especially , that on the production ( at tevatron and lhc ) .",
    "the hadronic production of @xmath5 meson has been studied quite a lot @xcite already .",
    "it is remarkable that with special techniques the event generator bcvegpy @xcite for the production is in compliment to the pythia environment @xcite and powerful enough in generating event samples for most purposes , i.e. , with it one can enhance the event generating efficiency greatly in contrast to pythia itself . with newly upgraded version bcvegpy2.0 , not only the ground state of @xmath5 meson but also ` low laying ' excited states can be generated .    up to now , the predictions for the @xmath5 hadronic production are mainly based on the dominant gluon - gluon fusion mechanism in terms of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations in order of @xmath6 , i.e. , via the sub - process @xmath7 with @xmath8 in the configurations of @xmath9- or @xmath10-wave states .",
    "the less important mechanism via light quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath11 is studied in @xcite only for comparison .",
    "however , the approaches to the existent estimates , in fact , all are in the fixed flavor number ( ffn ) scheme @xcite only with certain extension - production , the active quark flavor numbers in the initial state is limited to @xmath12 ( i.e. the initial state does not contain the heavy quark components at all ) and accordingly in the production of @xmath0 , the pdfs , just cteq5f3@xcite , which corresponds to the 3-flavor scheme of ffn , should be used ; but in the existent estimates when extending to higher anergy and higher @xmath3 for the production , cteq6l ( or cteq4l ) etc @xcite , which is derived with @xmath13 as the pdfs , was used instead , thus here we call such approach as extended ffn scheme . ] .",
    "recently , as pointed out by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , in hadronic production of charmonium , the contribution from the sea charm quark via the subprocess @xmath14 may be greater than that from the gluon - gluon fusion via the subprocess @xmath15 for charmonium color - singlet production .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to examine the production by applying the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme @xcite and see how important are the heavy charm and bottom quark mechanisms in the hadronic production of @xmath0 meson not only to compare with the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism but also with the existent estimations . to be noted that here the heavy quark means the sea parton for the heavy flavor , which is different from what it means in ref .",
    "generally the mechanisms induced by the heavy quark components must be considered in the gm - vfn scheme , and they are suppressed in comparison with the light partons such as the light valance quarks , light sea quarks and gluons in pdfs . however , the suppression fact may be ` compensated ' by their lower order nature in perturbative qcd and a much ` greater ' phase space . naively , the sub - processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath18-body @xmath19-body processes in the order of @xmath20 , while the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess @xmath7 is @xmath18-body @xmath21-body process in the order of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we devote this work to estimate the production in terms of the gm - vfn scheme by taking into account the contributions from the ` heavy quark mechanisms ' and that from the light partons , especially , the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism together , not only estimating the total cross sections , but also studying their properties on transverse - momentum @xmath3 and rapidity @xmath23 distributions etc .    in gm - vfn scheme when we talk about the heavy quark components of pdfs and taking into account both of the heavy quark mechanisms and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism for the hadronic production , one has to solve the double counting problem : i.e. a full qcd evolved heavy quark charm / bottom distribution functions , according to the altarelli - parisi equations , includes all the terms proportional to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 the factorization scale and @xmath26 the heavy quark mass ) ; and some of them come from the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , i.e. , a few terms appear from the integration of the phase - space for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism .",
    "therefore , one needs to make proper subtractions to solve the double counting problem @xcite .",
    "one convenient way to do the ` subtraction ' is to adopt the gm - vfn scheme , in which the heavy - quark mass effects are treated in a consistent way both for the hard scattering amplitude and the pdfs @xcite .",
    "moreover , it will be necessary to use the dedicated pdfs with heavy - mass effects included , which are determined by global fitting utilizing massive hard - scattering cross - sections .",
    "for instance , for the present analysis , the cteq6hq @xcite is used .",
    "later on for convenience , we will call the ` heavy quark mechanisms ' which have been subtracted according to method in gm - vfn scheme as ` intrinsic ones ' accordingly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "the basic formulae for the ` intrinsic charm and bottom mechanisms ' in the gm - vfn scheme are presented for the hadronic production of @xmath9-wave @xmath27-quarkonium states , i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in sec.iii",
    ", we present the numerical results for the intrinsic mechanisms and make some comparisons about them . the final section is reserved for discussion and summary .",
    "to study the ` intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms ' for the hadronic @xmath0-production , we need to study the hadronic processes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . and , to make the intrinsic mechanisms and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism consistently coexist , we need to do the subtractions so as to avoid the double counting . for this purpose",
    "we adopt the proper way in gm - vfn scheme @xcite in this work .    according to pqcd factorization theorem , in the gm - vfn scheme @xcite , the cross - section for the hadronic production of @xmath33 ( including all of the mechanisms , even the light - quark annihilation one via the subprocesses @xmath34 )",

    "@xmath44 stands for the hadronic cross - section and @xmath45 stands for the corresponding subprocesses . for convenience",
    ", we have taken the renormalization scale @xmath46 for the subprocess and the factorization scale @xmath47 for factorizing the pdfs and the hard subprocess to be the same , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "in the square brackets , the subtraction term for @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 the quark distribution @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 stands for heavy quark @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) within an on - shell gluon up to order @xmath36 is connected to the familiar @xmath55 splitting function @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 with @xmath58 .    in eq.([pqcdf0 ] ) , the first term represents for the dominant gluon - gluon fusion mechanism ; the second one for the light quark and anti - quark annihilation mechanism ; the remainders for the so ` intrinsic charm / bottom mechanisms ' , in which the subtraction is introduced to avoid the double counting @xcite .",
    "the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism and the light quark and anti - quark annihilation mechanism have been considered in several previous papers@xcite , and for their investigation , now the @xmath5 meson generator bcvegpy @xcite may be employed conveniently . as for the ` intrinsic charm / bottom mechanisms ' , we need to calculate three kinds of subprocesses : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for the hadronic production via @xmath61 ,",
    "i.e. the fifth term in eq.([pqcdf0 ] ) when a @xmath3 cut ( not too tiny ) is put on ( as usually done in experiment ) , it makes no contributions to the @xmath0 production , because its hard subprocess is a @xmath62 process essentially .",
    "thus , we will not consider it in this paper , because the tevatron and lhc experiments always put on some cut for small @xmath3 .",

    "the corresponding diagrams for @xmath67 production are similar , and can be obtained by directly replacing @xmath5 with @xmath67 in fig.([fig ] ) . to be specific , according to eq.([pqcdf0 ] ) , the inclusive @xmath5 hadronic production via ` intrinsic charm / bottom mechanisms ' can be formulated as , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 for ` intrinsic ' charm mechanism and @xmath71 for ` intrinsic ' bottom mechanism . here , the heavy quark pdf @xmath49 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 , @xmath72 or @xmath54 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) , includes the subtraction term @xmath73 as is defined in eq.([subtraction ] ) in order to avoid the double counting . using subtraction method to avoid the double counting",
    "was pointed out in ref.@xcite and then as the gm - vfn scheme was developed in @xcite . in fig.([graphical ] ) , we take the ` intrinsic ' bottom process ( fig.([fig]a ) ) as an example to illustrate this approach graphically , which is similar to the case of hadronic production of heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath74 on the internal quark line in the subtraction terms mean that the heavy quark four momentum squared is on mass - shell and moving longitudinally , which is a good approximation when the quark is collinear to the gluon , and results in a factor of order @xmath36 distribution of a quark in a gluon , like in eq.([quark ] ) .    in eq.([pqcdf ] ) , @xmath75 stands for the usual 2-to-2 differential cross - section , @xmath76 here , @xmath77 , @xmath78 are the corresponding momenta of the initial two partons and @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the momenta of the final ones , respectively .",

    "we generate the amplitude and square it @xmath81 with the program package : feynman diagram calculation ( fdc)@xcite , which is a reduce and fortran package to perform feynman diagram calculation automatically and has been well - tested by various applications .",
    "the phase space integration is manipulated by the routines rambos @xcite and vegas @xcite , which can be found in bcvegpy @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results of the ` intrinsic charm and bottom mechanisms ' and then make a comparison with that of the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism .",
    "the combined results for both the ` intrinsic mechanisms ' and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism are consistently treated within the gm - vfn scheme .",
    "finally , we shall make a comparison of the present results with the existing results in the literature .",
    "in doing the numerical calculations , the values of the radial wave function of @xmath5 or @xmath67 at the origin is taken as what in refs .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath82 ; the masses of @xmath53 and @xmath83 quarks are taken as @xmath84 gev and @xmath85 gev , respectively ; the mass of the bound state is approximately taken to be the sum of the two heavy quark masses , i.e. @xmath86 gev ( to ensure the gauge invariance of the concerned amplitudes ) .",

    "cteq6hq is adopted here in the calculations , because it is an improved set of the parton distributions determined for the gm - vfn scheme that incorporates heavy flavor mass effects .",
    "to see the fact how the ` double counting ' is subtracted in gm - vfn scheme precisely , first of all we take lhc as an example to compute each term numerically according to eq.([pqcdf0 ] ) for heavy quarks and present them in fig.([fig5 ] ) . from the figure",

    "[ cutcross1 ] and [ cutcross2 ] the cross - sections obtained with gm - vfn scheme and ffn scheme ( with slight extension cteq6l to replace cteq5f3 ) for the hadronic production of @xmath0 are shown quantitatively . due to the fact that the gluon distribution of cteq6hq for gm - vfn scheme is always smaller than that of cteq6l , especially at small @xmath115 regions , so the cross - section for the gluon - gluon fusion under the gm - vfn scheme is smaller than that under the ffn scheme .",

    "as shown in tables ( [ cutcross1 ] ) and ( [ cutcross2 ] ) , we have found that the total cross sections of the ` intrinsic charm and the bottom mechanisms ' may be comparable to that of the gluon - gluon fusion process , especially the bottom quark interaction mechanism .",

    "the differential cross section of the @xmath5 transverse production rate due to the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism surpasses all that from the involved ` intrinsic charm and bottom mechanisms ' .",

    "while the value of @xmath3 becomes big , the results are almost the same for both schemes .",
    "this is because that when the magnitude of @xmath3 becomes big , the contributions from the ` intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms ' are greatly suppressed due to the subtraction terms in gm - vfn scheme and the dominant contribution tends to be the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism . for the most practical purposes and for the production at lhc and tevatron one does not need to care of the difference on the predictions of the gm - vfn scheme and the extended ffn scheme which were used in most references except those in the small region ( @xmath122 gev ) .    in conclusion , if one takes the gm - vfn scheme , the ` intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms ' in @xmath0 hadroproduction are important in small @xmath3 region in comparison with the dominant gluon - gluon fusion mechanism",
    "therefore , if @xmath3-cut of @xmath5 can be taken so small as @xmath123 gev , the contributions from the ` intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms ' may be seen by the difference from the predictions not only of the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism in gm - vfn scheme , but also of the mechanism in extended ffn scheme ( the predictions in most references ) .",
    "hence a detailed experimental study of the production in small @xmath3 region could gain some information on the ` intrinsic charm and bottom ' distributions inside the hadron , and will give a ` judgement ' about the gm - vfn scheme and the extended ffn scheme . according to the investigation here , the ` intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms ' can be used as a supplement to the usual gluon - gluon fusion mechanism in gm - vfn scheme , especially , when experiments can reach to very small @xmath3 region and indicate some deficiency for the production .",
    "probably some suitable fixed target experiments , in which the detector may cover almost all solid angles ( almost without @xmath3 cut ) , can test the ` intrinsic charm and bottom mechanisms ' in the future .    *",
