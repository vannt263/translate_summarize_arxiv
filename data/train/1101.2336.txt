    "emission observed from black hole binaries ( bhbs ) is variable on both long and short timescales . on the longest timescales , changes in mass accretion rate drive changes in spectral state . at the lowest luminosities ,",
    "the system is typically seen in the low / hard state , where the spectrum is dominated by a hard ( photon index @xmath1 ) power law tail , peaking at 100  kev .",
    "as the source brightens , there is an increasing contribution from the disc at low energies and the tail softens towards @xmath2 ( intermediate state ) .",
    "the tail can then either remain strong as the source flux increases , giving the very high state ( @xmath3 ) or it can carry only a very small fraction of the luminosity , giving the high / soft state ( @xmath4 ) ( e.g. see reviews by remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 , hereafter dgk07 ) .    much of this long term spectral evolution can be successfully described by the truncated disc model ( dgk07 ) . here , the assumption is that the cool , geometrically thin , optically thick disc is truncated at some radius , @xmath5 , which is much larger than the last stable orbit , @xmath6 at the lowest luminosities .",
    "the inner accretion flow extends from @xmath5 to an innermost radius , @xmath7 , forming some sort of hot , geometrically thick , optically thin ( optical depth @xmath8 ) flow , similar to an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf , narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "decreasing the truncation radius of the thin disc with increasing luminosity ( and therefore average mass accretion rate ) leads to a stronger disc component and greater illumination of the hot flow by the cool disc photons and hence to a softer comptonised tail .",
    "this spectral evolution has a natural end when @xmath9 , marking the transition to the disc dominated soft states seen at higher luminosities .",
    "there is also rapid variability on timescales of 100 - 0.1s which is almost exclusively linked to the comptonised tail ( e.g. churazov et al 2001 ) .",
    "this is as expected as the disc emission can only vary on a viscous timescale of @xmath10  s i.e. 500  s at the last stable orbit for fiducial thin disc parameters of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a power spectral analysis of the rapid variability shows that it is generally composed of a broadband noise continuum , with a low frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( lf qpo ) superimposed on this .",
    "the broadband noise can be very roughly characterized as a twice broken power law , with @xmath13 at the lowest frequencies , breaking to @xmath14 above the low frequency break @xmath15 , and then breaking again to @xmath16 above a high frequency break at @xmath17 .",
    "the low frequency break is tightly correlated with the spectral state of the source , with @xmath18  hz for the dimmest low / hard states , and increasing to @xmath19  hz as the source softens through the bright low / hard states into the intermediate state .",
    "the lf qpo properties are also tightly correlated with this power spectral and energy spectral evolution , with qpo frequency @xmath20 increasing from 0.1 - 10  hz , as the coherence , power and harmonic content of this feature also increase ( e.g. van der klis et al 2004 ) .",
    "again , this can be interpreted qualitatively in the truncated disc picture if the low frequency break and qpo are somehow associated with the truncation radius .",
    "as the disc extends further inwards , the spectrum softens , and all frequencies associated with this radius increase ( e.g. dgk07 ) .",
    "however , to go beyond this into a quantitative description requires a specific model for both the broadband noise and qpo .",
    "this is problematic , despite both having been known for many decades ( e.g. van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "there are multiple potential models for the lf qpo in the literature which fall into 2 main categories : those associated with a geometrical misalignment of the accretion flow and black hole spin ( stella & vietri 1998 ; fragile , mathews & wilson 2001 ; schnittman 2005 ; schnittman et al 2006 ; ingram , done & fragile 2009 , hereafter idf09 ) , and those associated with wave modes of the accretion flow ( wagoner et al 2001 ; titarchuk & oscherovich 1999 ; cabanac et al 2008 ) .",
    "most of these concentrate on matching the qpo frequency , but the spectrum of the qpo gives additional constraints .",
    "this is similar to that of the spectrum of the broadband variability , showing that they both arise predominantly from the comptonising region rather than the disc ( e.g gilfanov et al 2003 ; sobolewska & zycki 2006 ) , favoring models in which the modulation arises directly from the comptonised emission e.g. idf09 , where the qpo is set by lense - thirring ( vertical ) precession of the entire hot inner flow interior to the disc truncation radius at @xmath5 , or by a mode of the hot inner flow ( cabernac et al 2008 ) .",
    "the physical origin for the viscosity of the flow is the magneto - rotational instability ( mri : balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "this is inherently variable , with large fluctuations in all quantities , both spatially and temporally ( krolik & hawley 2002 ) , making it a natural origin for the broad band noise ( noble & krolik 2009 ; ingram & done 2010 ; dexter & fragile 2011 ) .",
    "however , these fluctuations also effectively shred any coherent wave modes in the flow ( see e.g. reynolds & miller 2009 ; henisey et al 2009 ) .",
    "this effectively rules out trapped wave propagation as the origin of the lf qpo , leaving lense - thirring precession as the most likely candidate .",
    "precession of the entire hot flow from @xmath5 to @xmath7 can match the observed lf qpo frequency in both bhbs ( idf09 ) _ and _ neutron stars ( ns ; ingram & done 2010 ) , and provides a clear mechanism to match the spectrum as this is a modulation of the comptonising region .",
    "thus the entire power spectrum can be explained by mri fluctuations in a hot flow , which is also precessing around the black hole .",
    "however , the power spectrum does not represent all the information contained in the variability , as it uses only fourier amplitudes , not phases .",
    "this is important as the light curves contain additional correlations which give a linear rms - flux relation ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ) .",
    "short segments of a longer light curve have a mean , @xmath21 , and variance , @xmath22 , which are related such that @xmath23 ( after binning : uttley & mchardy 2001 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the flux on these timescales having a log - normal distribution ( negoro et al 2000 ) , and rules out simple models of the variability where the light curve is made from adding together multiple , uncorrelated events ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ; see also dgk07 ) .",
    "instead , this can be produced if the light curve is made from a multiplicative process , rather than an additive one .",
    "again , the mri in the hot flow gives a physical interpretation to this .",
    "the mri at large radii produces intrinsic fluctuations in the density of the flow .",
    "these fluctuations propagate down to smaller radii on a viscous timescale , so all higher frequency fluctuations are smoothed out .",
    "these smoothed and lagged fluctuations in mass accretion rate modulate the mri fluctuations produced by the next radius , and so on , down to the smallest radii in the flow ( luybarski 1997 : hereafter l97 ) .",
    "this naturally produces a light curve which has an rms - flux relation / log - normal flux distribution ( kotov et al 2001 : hereafter k01 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 : hereafter au06 ; also see misra & zdziarski 2008 ) .",
    "here we use these ideas to build a model for the entire power spectrum , where the broadband noise arises from propagation of mri fluctuations through the hot flow from @xmath5 to @xmath7 and the lf qpo arises from lense - thirring precession _ of the same hot flow_. we fit this model to a sequence of power spectra of xte j1550 - 564 observed during a transition from low / hard to intermediate state , and show that these give a good _ quantitative _ fit for @xmath5 moving from @xmath24 , as also required to explain the sequence in energy spectra during this transition .",
    "this gives very strong support to the underlying truncated disc geometry , and for lense - thirring precession as the physical origin for the lf qpo .",
    "we first introduce the simplified toy model considered in idf09 and ingram & done ( 2010 ) , whereby the low frequency break , @xmath15 , occurs at the viscous frequency of the truncation radius and the qpo frequency , @xmath25 , is the precession frequency of the flow . using the shakura sunyaev ( 1973 ) viscosity prescription , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath28 the flow semi - thickness , @xmath29 the keplerian frequency and @xmath30 is the infall velocity .",
    "the lense - thirring precession frequency is then a weighted average of the point particle precession frequency at each radius in the hot flow , so @xmath31 ( liu & melia 2002 ) where @xmath7 is the innermost point of the flow ( i.e. the surface density is negligible interior to this ) , @xmath32 is the surface density and @xmath33\\ ] ] is the point particle lense - thirring precession frequency for a dimensionless spin parameter @xmath34 ( merloni et al 1999 ) . here",
    ", @xmath35 is dimensionless , expressed in units of @xmath36 . solving this assuming a power law form for surface density in the hot flow @xmath37 between an inner and outer radius for the hot flow @xmath38 and @xmath5 ( fragile et al 2007 , idf09 ) gives @xmath39 } { r_o^{5/2-\\zeta}r_i^{1/2+\\zeta } [ 1-(r_i / r_o)^{5/2-\\zeta}]}\\frac{c}{r_g}.\\ ] ]    hence this model predicts the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath15 which can be compared to the multiple observations of these frequencies in both black holes and neutron stars ( e.g. wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; klein - wolt & van der klis 2008 ) .",
    "the observed relation is continuous , implying that these frequencies show the same behavior in both sources , i.e. that neither can depend strongly on any property of the neutron star surface but are instead set by the accretion flow itself .",
    "we re - plot this data in figure [ fig : wkplot ] , normalizing the frequencies by mass for a fiducial mass of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for neutron stars ( red triangles ) and black holes ( black circles ) , respectively .",
    "this shows even more clearly that the two different types of object show the same observed relation between these frequencies as they now occupy the same range .",
    "the blue lines show the prediction of the toy model , where the hot flow has constant @xmath42 and @xmath43 , surface density constant with radius ( i.e. @xmath44 : fragile et al 2007 ) between @xmath5 and @xmath38 , where @xmath38 is given by the bending wave radius .",
    "warps in a large scale height flow are communicated via bending waves which have wavelength @xmath45 and so are smooth at large @xmath35 and oscillatory at small @xmath35 .",
    "the bending wave radius ( @xmath46 ; fragile et al 2007 ; 2009 ; fragile 2009 ; idf09 ) marks the transition between the two regimes .",
    "we show @xmath47 ( dot - dashed ) , @xmath48 ( dashed ) and @xmath49 ( solid ) .",
    "while this very simple model predicts frequencies which are fairly close to the observations , it is clear that the gradient of this model in log space is different from that observed .",
    "plainly the assumptions above are very simplistic .",
    "global analytic models of the hot flow with a standard @xmath27 viscosity do not have @xmath50 as they depart from the self - similar solutions at @xmath51 due to the requirement that the flow becomes supersonic ( narayan , kato & honma 1997 ; gammie & popham 1998 ) .",
    "full numerical simulations also show that @xmath27 is not constant ( e.g. fragile et al 2007 ; 2009 ) .",
    "ingram & done ( 2010 ) also suggest that @xmath52 can change in neutron stars as the material piles up onto a boundary layer . however , the similarity between the mass scaled frequencies seen in neutron stars and black holes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wkplot ] make this now seem unlikely to be an important effect as it would not affect the black holes .    here",
    "then we simply assume that @xmath53 is a power law function of radius , so that @xmath54 .",
    "we choose values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 which allow us to match the data in figure [ fig : wkplot ] .",
    "we see good agreement with the observations for @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( green lines ) , again for @xmath47 ( dot - dashed ) , @xmath48 ( dashed ) and @xmath49 ( solid ) .",
    "we use this specific prescription for the viscous frequency in the following section .",
    "we consider a model where local fluctuations in the mass accretion rate of the flow propagate down towards the central object ( e.g. l97 ; k01 ) .",
    "our method mainly follows that of au06 , with a few small differences .",
    "we split the flow into annuli , characterized by a radius @xmath59 and width @xmath60 , with logarithmic spacing so @xmath61 is a constant for all annuli from @xmath5 to @xmath38 . as @xmath62 in our prescription , constant @xmath61 also implies constant @xmath63 which au06 show is the feature required to produce a linear sigma - flux relation .",
    "mri fluctuations throughout the flow generate variability in all quantities .",
    "fluctuations in mass accretion rate will most likely be damped by the response of the flow on timescales shorter than the local viscous timescale .",
    "we therefore assume that the generated power spectrum of mass accretion rate fluctuations at radius @xmath59 is given by a zero centred lorentzian cutting off at the viscous frequency @xmath64 where @xmath65 as discussed at the end of section [ sec : mod ] and a tilde denotes a fourier transform .",
    "we start at the outermost annulus , so @xmath66 , and generate the time dependent fluctuations in mass accretion rate , @xmath67 , from equation [ eqn : poff ] using the method of timmer & koenig ( 1995 ) .",
    "we normalize each @xmath68 to have a mean of unity and fractional variability @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the fractional variability per decade in radial extent and @xmath71 is the number of annuli per decade in radial extent .",
    "thus the mass accretion rate across the first annulus is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mean mass accretion rate .",
    "this then propagates inward to the second annulus , travelling a distance @xmath74 , which takes a time @xmath75 .",
    "when it arrives at @xmath76 , it has been filtered by the response of the flow which we take from psaltis & norman ( 2000 ) to get @xmath77 ^ 2 } } .",
    "\\label{eqn : pandn}\\ ] ] the mass accretion rate at the @xmath78 annulus is then given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "however , equation [ eqn : pandn ] only filters out fluctuations on much shorter timescales ( by a factor @xmath81 ) than the typical timescales generated in the annulus ( equation [ eqn : poff ] ) and so we can say @xmath82 to a very good approximation . the mass accretion rate at the @xmath78 annulus is therefore given by @xmath83 until the @xmath84 annulus which is @xmath38 .    to transform this into a light curve",
    "requires an emissivity , @xmath85 such that the luminosity from each annulus is given by @xmath86 where we assume the emissivity @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a boundary condition . for a newtonian thin disc , @xmath89",
    "and we have the stress free inner boundary @xmath90 but we note that the large scale magnetic fields present in the large scale height flow can give a stressed inner boundary condition @xmath91 ( agol & krolik 2000 ; beckwith hawley & krolik 2008 ) .",
    "we also allow @xmath92 to be a free parameter as the emission need not exactly follow the radial dependence of gravitational energy release as long as the _ total _ energy release is gravitational .",
    "a different emissivity for different energy bands gives a way for the model to predict frequency dependent time lags between hard and soft x - ray bands ( k01 ; au06 ) .",
    "this will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "@xmath93    figure [ fig : broadband]a shows 20  s of the resulting light curve for a fiducial set of input parameters for a black hole mass of @xmath94 and a spin of @xmath48 .",
    "we assume @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath98 with a stressed inner boundary condition ( see section [ sec : mod ] ) . we calculate the light curve with @xmath99 time points , corresponding to @xmath100  s ( a typical length for an rxte observation ) of data on a time binning of @xmath101  s , and 30 radial bins .",
    "figure [ fig : broadband]b ( red ) shows the psd of this light curve , while the black and green points show the effect of changing the number of radial bins to 10 and 100 , respectively .",
    "clearly , the high frequency power is not well resolved with only 10 radial bins , while the difference between 30 and 100 is very small . hence",
    "in all that follows , we use 30 radial bins for each simulation .",
    "the psd shows the same characteristic broadband noise features as are seen in the power spectra of black hole binaries , namely band limited noise , with low and high frequency breaks , peaking between 0.1 - 10  hz .",
    "figure [ fig : broadband]c shows the rms - flux relation for the fiducial light curve , derived from splitting this into 4s segments . as with the data ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ) , we see a large scatter before binning ( gray points ) but , after binning ( red crosses ) , we retrieve a linear flux - rms relation ( au06 ) .",
    "the major prediction of the truncated disc / hot inner flow model is that the spectral softening as the source brightens from a low / hard through to intermediate states is caused by the truncation radius of the thin disc moving inwards ( e.g. dgk07 ; gierlinski , done & page 2008 ) .",
    "this radius also sets the outer edge of the hot flow , so this predicts that @xmath5 decreases also .",
    "figure [ fig : fvar ] shows the predicted psd for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , as required to match the energy spectral evolution ( and low frequency qpo : idf09 ) , with all other parameters held constant at the fiducial model values described above .",
    "the model _ predicts _ that decreasing the outer radius of the hot flow leads to less low frequency power , while the high frequency power remains constant .",
    "this is precisely what is seen in the psd of the data ( dgk07 ; gierlinski , nikolajuk & czerny 2008 ) .",
    "this is the first physical model of the power spectral behavior which naturally reproduces the observations .",
    "the low frequency break is close to the frequency of the viscous timescale at @xmath5 , as proposed by e.g. by churazov et al ( 2001 ) ; gilfanov & areief ( 2005 ) ; dgk07 ; ingram & done ( 2010 ) .",
    "however , the high frequency break is _ not _ at the viscous frequency at @xmath38 .",
    "we explore the origin of the high frequency break below .",
    "= 6.5 cm      @xmath105    figure [ fig : cor]a shows a model where the variability at each radius is a lorentzian at the local viscous frequency ( see equation [ eqn : poff ] ) , but with no propagation so there is no causal connection between annuli .",
    "we show the psd of the resulting @xmath68 functions from 5 of the 30 individual radial annuli , from @xmath5 to @xmath38 as the gray lines on figure [ fig : cor]a .",
    "these peak , as expected , at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the total variability ( red ) is an emissivity weighted sum of these fluctuations , but since they are uncorrelated , the effect of this is to strongly dilute the total variability seen .",
    "this total psd does have @xmath108hz as our emissivity weighting strongly favors the smallest radii , but @xmath109 ( @xmath110hz and @xmath111hz respectively ) .",
    "in fact , to achieve @xmath14 as observed , we would have to assume a completely flat emissivity profile , which seems very unlikely .",
    "more fundamentally , such uncorrelated fluctuations _ can not _ reproduce a linear rms - flux relation .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to a model where fluctuations propagate down in radius .",
    "the resulting psd from the same set of radii are shown in figure [ fig : cor]b , where the power in each annulus increases strongly with radius as the mri power generated in each annulus is modulated by the propagating fluctuations from all radii prior to it .",
    "the red line shows the resulting emissivity weighted power spectrum from the total flow assuming that time lags between radii are negligible .",
    "this preserves the maximum correlation between variability at different annuli i.e. gives the least dilution between fluctuations in different annuli .",
    "this is very different to that in figure [ fig : cor]a , both in normalization and shape .",
    "the normalization is dramatically enhanced because the long timescale fluctuations are correlated together , so at low frequencies the power from different radii add together as they are in phase .",
    "this gives @xmath112hz as the correlated variability weighting to larger radii is stronger than the emissivity weighting to smaller radii .",
    "however , at the fastest timescales , the power is mainly generated at the smallest radii , so it does not correlate with any other fluctuations generated at larger radii , so is not enhanced in the same way .",
    "the blue line shows how time delays dramatically change the high frequency break as the propagation time prevents the mass accretion rate from two consecutive annuli from being correlated on time scales shorter than @xmath113 .",
    "this reduces the correlation between the fastest timescale variability , strongly suppressing high frequency power .",
    "thus in the propagating fluctuation model , the low frequency break is @xmath114 but @xmath115 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    we use an emissivity to translate the fluctuations in mass accretion rate to a luminosity .",
    "this emissivity is in two parts , firstly a power law dependence in radius , and secondly a boundary condition .",
    "our fiducial model parameters have @xmath98 and a stressed boundary condition , @xmath91 .",
    "this emissivity peaks at @xmath38 , so fluctuations from the very smallest radii are given most weight .",
    "figure [ fig : boundary ] compares this ( black line ) with results using the same power law radial dependence , but with a stress ",
    "free inner boundary condition ( red line ) , @xmath116 .",
    "this emissivity goes to zero at the innermost radius , so the highest frequency fluctuations are strongly suppressed .",
    "however , this also has a more subtle effect on the region between the two breaks , as there is a gradual decrease in weighting of fluctuations below @xmath117 , and a stronger weighting to the fluctuations at larger radii , giving the tilt between @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "this effect is similar to that of changing the radial dependence of the emissivity .",
    "the green line shows @xmath89 with a stress - free boundary condition , showing an even stronger tilt to the psd between @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( green ) .",
    "however , it is also similar to changing the inner radius of the flow .",
    "the blue line in figure [ fig : boundary ] shows the resulting psd from @xmath89 and a stress - free inner boundary condition with @xmath118 .",
    "thus there are degeneracies between the two parts to the emissivity and the inner radius , making it unlikely that they can all be uniquely constrained by the observed psd .",
    "it is clear from this analysis that while the low frequency break is fairly strongly linked to the viscous timescale of the outer radius of the hot flow ( as assumed in section [ sec : mod ] ) , the high frequency break is rather more complex , depending on propagation correlations , emissivity , boundary condition and inner radius in addition to the viscous timescale .",
    "this makes it difficult to directly associate the high frequency break with any physical parameter of the models .",
    "instead , we now use the additional information from the qpo to remove some of the degeneracies inherent in this model for the broadband noise .",
    "[ sec : qpo ]    for our fiducial model , we used the observed relation between the low frequency break and lf qpo to set the radial dependence of the viscous timescale , assuming that the low frequency break was set by the viscous timescale at @xmath5 and that the qpo was lense - thirring precession of the entire hot flow from @xmath5 to @xmath38 ( section [ sec : mod ] ) .",
    "this assumed that the surface density of the hot flow , @xmath119 between @xmath5 and @xmath38 , with @xmath44 .",
    "however , the broadband noise model described above _ calculates _ a self - consistent surface density as mass conservation implies @xmath120 ( frank , king & raine 1992 ) where @xmath30 is now expressed in units of @xmath121 , @xmath122 in units of @xmath73 , @xmath32 in units of @xmath123 and @xmath35 in units of @xmath124 . using our velocity prescription",
    ", we can then easily show @xmath125 this means that , for the time averaged surface density , @xmath126 giving extra physical motivation for the parameters used in section [ sec : mod ] ( @xmath44 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : surfaced ] shows @xmath128 plotted at a number of different times ( @xmath129 ) along with the corresponding @xmath130 function .",
    "@xmath130 is quite clearly more variable at small @xmath35 .",
    "this is because we have assumed the variability _ generated _ in each logarithmic annulus to be the same but annuli at smaller radii include also the fluctuations that have propagated down from large @xmath35 and so the _ emitted _ variability is greater ( see figure [ fig : cor]b ) .",
    "we do not see a drop off in surface density at the bending wave radius like that seen in simulations ( e.g. fragile 2009 ) because we assume that the infall velocity can be given by a power law .",
    "it is clear that , for the surface density drop off at a given point , the infall velocity must accelerate at that point . in a future paper",
    ", we will investigate this model with a more advanced velocity prescription .",
    "@xmath131    therefore the broadband noise model above , set by @xmath38 , @xmath5 and @xmath70 _ predicts _ the qpo frequency at any point in time .",
    "the fluctuations in surface density with time _ predict _ that the qpo frequency changes , i.e. it is quasi ",
    "periodic rather than truly periodic .",
    "however , the precession frequency will not respond instantaneously to these changes , as their effect is only communicated across the entire hot flow by bending waves .",
    "these travel at the sound speed , faster by a factor @xmath132 than the viscous timescale across the region , so we calculate the qpo frequency every @xmath133  s rather than at every point .",
    "we then average these values to get the predicted qpo frequency , @xmath25 , and use the dispersion around this to set the _",
    "_ variance of these qpo frequencies , @xmath134 .",
    "[ fig : qvsqpo ] shows @xmath135 as a function of @xmath25 as @xmath5 varies from 30010 in the fiducial model . this decrease in @xmath5 not only leads to an increase in qpo frequency , but also to a decrease in the qpo width , or equivalently , an increase in its coherence / quality factor @xmath136 .",
    "this correlation is well known in qpo data from bhb ( e.g. belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ; rao et al 2010 ) .",
    "our model provides the first physical explanation for this effect as the smaller the radial extent , the higher the qpo frequency , but also the smaller the fluctuation power , giving smaller jitter in frequency .",
    "the red squares in fig [ fig : qvsqpo ] show the _ observed _ frequency and width of the qpo from data from the 1998 rise to outburst of the bhb xte j1550 - 564 ( see section 7 ) .",

    ". however , other effects such as the on - time of the qpo ( see lachowicz & done 2010 ) can decrease the coherence of the signal , so here we simply use the data to determine the qpo width ( parametrized as a quality factor @xmath136 ) after using the broadband noise surface density to determine the qpo frequency , @xmath25 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    @xmath137    = 6.5 cm    the model also predicts another correlation , one between the qpo frequency and flux on short timescales .",

    "after binning ( red crosses ) , there is a clear linear relation between the two .",
    "this happens because both the qpo frequency and the luminosity depend on the mass accretion rate fluctuations .",
    "a perturbation in mass accretion rate at large @xmath35 will lead to a perturbation in the surface density .",
    "this will reduce the precession frequency but will have little effect on the luminosity because the emissivity is quite steeply weighted towards small @xmath35 . later on ,",
    "this perturbation will have propagated inwards to small @xmath35 where it has the effect of increasing the precession frequency , but now also has much more of an effect on the luminosity .",
    "heil et al ( 2011 ) have recently discovered this correlation in data from the 1998 rise to outburst of xte j1550 - 564 ( the same data as we will be considering in section [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "they also find that the gradient of this relation is steeper for observations with a higher qpo frequency .",
    "this is also predicted by the model as illustrated in the bottom plot of figure [ fig : lvsqpo ] where we have measured the gradient of the @xmath25-@xmath139 relation and the average qpo frequency for @xmath140 different @xmath5 values .",
    "there is clearly a very strong correlation as is seen in the data .",
    "this is because an _ absolute _ change in precession frequency depends on a _ fractional _ change in mass accretion rate whereas an _",
    "absolute _ change in luminosity depends on an _ absolute _ change in mass accretion rate . the same absolute change in mass accretion rate at a given radius and time constitutes a larger _ fractional _ change for small @xmath5 than for high @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the luminosity will experience exactly the same change in both instances but the precession frequency will undergo a larger change when @xmath5 is smaller . the fact that these are _ predicted _ properties of the model constitutes strong support for its validity .    in the following section",
    ", we will fit the psd from our model to data . for this",
    ", we will need to predict a _ shape _ for the qpo light curve as well as a frequency .",
    "the data show that the qpo has a power spectrum which can be represented by a lorentzian at the fundamental frequency , @xmath25 , together with its second and third harmonic and sub - harmonic i.e. at @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( e.g. belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ) .",
    "our model for the qpo in terms of lense - thirring precession _ predicts _ the shape of the modulation of the emission from the hot flow via variation of projected area , self - occultation and seed photons ( idf09 ) .",
    "we will explore this further in a later paper ( ingram , done & @xmath144ycki in prep ) , but here we simply assume that all the harmonics have the same quality factor , @xmath145 , and allow the power in each harmonic to be a free parameter .",
    "we then generate a qpo light curve , @xmath146 , using these narrow lorenzians as input to the timmer & koenig ( 1995 ) algorithm , and add this to the light curve already created for the broadband noise .",
    "we show an example of the final predicted psd in figure [ fig : qpoandbb ] , using the fiducial model parameters with @xmath102 ( black ) , @xmath103 ( red ) and @xmath104 ( green ) .",
    "for clarity , we have set the normalization of all the harmonics other than the fundamental to @xmath147 , set the width of the qpo using the model prediction of @xmath135 , and set its rms power @xmath148 .",
    "these psd show all the main features seen in the data during spectral transitions of bhb ( gierlinski , nikolajuk & czerny 2008 ) .",
    "we now have a model which can produce both the broad band noise and qpo self consistently from the same changing geometry as required by the corresponding evolution of the energy spectra , namely a changing outer radius of the hot flow ( set by the changing inner radius of the thin disc ) .",
    "this model gives the major correlation between the low frequency break and low frequency qpo .",
    "the propagating fluctuations naturally give the rms - flux relation , while the qpo model also gives a framework in which to understand the increase in coherence of the qpo with frequency , and even the short timescale correlation of the qpo frequency with flux .",
    "plainly , the next step is to use this model to fit real data .",
    "we use rxte data from the 1998 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 ( remillard et al 2002 ; sobczak et al 2000 ; rao et al 2010 ; wilson & done 2001 ) .",
    "we look at 5 specific observations with observational ids : 30188 - 06 - 03 - 00 , 30188 - 06 - 01 - 00 , 30188 - 06 - 01 - 03 , 30188 - 06 - 05 - 00 and 30188 - 06 - 11 - 00 ; hereafter observations 1 - 5 respectively .",
    "we only consider energy channels 36 - 71 ( corresponding to 10 - 20  kev ) in order to avoid disc contamination .    in all our results",
    "so far we have shown power spectra produced by averaging the logarithm of the periodogram as papadakis & lawrence ( 1993 ) show that , for a red noise variability process , the error estimate converges to gaussian with only @xmath149 samples , rather than the @xmath150 required for averaging the linear power estimates .",
    "our simulations average over @xmath151 samples of the psd but the number of segments from the real data can not be chosen as they are simply set by the length of the available data .",
    "these give @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively , implying that the errors on the psd from the data are only approximately gaussian .",
    "a further complication is that the error distribution of the periodogram is dependent on the shape of the underlying power spectrum ( e.g. mueller , madejski & done 2004 ; mueller & madejski 2009 ) meaning that even @xmath154 may not be enough to give gaussian errors in this particular case .",
    "nonetheless , we choose to use @xmath155 minimization for simplicity , but we then do _ a posteriore _ checks on the goodness of fit using the rejection probability method of uttley et al ( 2002 ) and markewicz et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "this entails first calculating @xmath156)^2}{(\\overline{\\delta p_{sim}(f)})^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the logarithmically smoothed simulated periodogram , with error @xmath158 , to be compared to @xmath159 raw observed periodograms , @xmath160 .",
    "we then re - simulate many ( 512 ) light curves and calculate many different values of @xmath161)^2}{(\\overline{\\delta p_{sim}(f)})^2}.\\ ] ] the rejection probability , @xmath162 , is given by the percentile of @xmath163 values which are lower than the one @xmath164 value .",
    "for example , if 128 of the @xmath163 values were smaller than the one @xmath164 value , the rejection probability is @xmath165 .",
    "this means there is a @xmath165 chance that the the observed light curve was generated by a different underlying variability process than the model .",
    "one aspect of using real data is that there are uncertainties associated with each point on the light curve .",
    "since we use the logarithmically averaged psd we need the power to be positive definite so we can not do white noise subtraction of the data psd .",
    "instead we add white noise to the simulation , and compare this with the total ( including noise ) power spectrum of the real data ( see also uttley et al 2002 ) .",
    "we incorporate our model for the power spectrum into xspec , using the local model functionality .",
    "our model outputs the logarithmically averaged total ( white noise included ) periodogram as a function of fourier frequency rather than the more familiar flux as a function of energy .",
    "we then fit this to the similarly logarithmically averaged total power spectra from the real data .",
    "the model parameters are the physical parameters governing the behavior of the flow .",
    "the most fundamental of these is the relation governing the viscous frequency at any radius .",
    "we have parametrized this as a power law function of the keplarian frequency at each radius , @xmath166 , but the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are unknown , so are free in the fits , as is @xmath70 , the intrinsic level of the mri fluctuations in mass accretion rate .",
    "then there are the geometric parameters @xmath5 and @xmath38 , where @xmath38 also couples to the emissivity , both in terms of the index @xmath92 and the boundary condition ( either stressed or stress free ) .",
    "the combination of @xmath5 , @xmath38 and the surface density profile fixes the qpo frequency , but we leave its width ( parametrized as a quality factor , q ) and normalization as free parameters .",
    "we also allow the normalization of the second , third and subharmonic to be free parameters , but fix these to have the same q as that of the fundamental .",
    "the final free parameter is the normalization of the simulated white noise level , @xmath167 , which we then subtract from both data and model in order to plot results .",
    "the truncated disc model predicts that @xmath5 is the major parameter which changes across this transition , where @xmath38 remains fixed .",
    "hence we fit all 5 power spectra simultaneously in xspec , with @xmath38 tied across all 5 datasets . because of the correlation between @xmath38 and both parts of the emissivity ( see section [ sec : boundary ] ) , we choose to compare results with some of these parameters fixed at different values .",
    "@xmath168    @xmath169    in this section we fit our model to the @xmath170 observations considered assuming a stressed inner boundary condition . figure [ fig : r - gammas ] displays the best fit models and data with the inner radius and emissivity index required to be constant across the @xmath170 observations .",
    "these appear by eye to be good fits , and this is confirmed by their rejection probabilities of @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 for observations 15 , respectively .",
    "we find the inner radius to be @xmath176 which , although low , is greater than the horizon of the black hole ( @xmath177 for our chosen @xmath48 ) .",
    "the truncation radius moves from @xmath178 .",
    "however , the fit requires that the power law index governing the viscous frequency , @xmath56 , increases across the observations , from @xmath179 .",
    "we will discuss the significance of this in section [ sec : para ] .      in the previous section , we recovered an inner radius fairly close to the horizon ( @xmath176 ) for fits with a stressed boundary condition .",
    "this assumption implies a causal connection to material closer in which , given the proximity of the emission to the horizon , may not be physical .",
    "hence the stress free inner boundary condition may be more physically appropriate .",
    "we repeat the fits assuming this , with results shown in figure [ fig : r - gammasf ] .",
    "we recover an even lower inner radius ( @xmath180 ) , and similar values for the truncation radius ( @xmath181 ) and power law index governing the viscous frequency ( @xmath182 ) . by eye",
    ", these again appear to be excellent fits ; in fact they look nearly identical to figure [ fig : r - gammas ] and have only a marginally higher @xmath155 value .",
    "however , these have rejection probabilities of @xmath183 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 for observations @xmath187 respectively , so they are all statistically unacceptable .",
    "a rejection probability of @xmath183 means that all of the 512 simulated psds had @xmath163 smaller than the one ` observed ' @xmath164 , making it extremely unlikely that the observed data is part of the simulated distribution .",
    "this discrepancy between @xmath155 and rejection probability points to the complex nature of the statistics of the periodogram .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in the appendix , but here we simply note that these results do _ not necessarily _ mean that there is no good fit for the stress free version of the model : they just mean that the real best fit parameters do not give the lowest @xmath155 .",
    "the previous fits with a stressed boundary condition also may not be the best fit in terms of rejection probability , the difference is that with the stressed boundary condition the minimum @xmath155 solution was also a statistically acceptable fit on rejection probability .",
    "we will explore this in more detail in a future paper ( ingram & done , in preparation )    however , as the fits appear to be good by eye , it seems very likely that there should be a set of parameters very close to the ones that minimize @xmath155 that give much lower rejection probabilities .",
    "although the statistical complexities of the periodogram currently limit the model fitting to data , the parameters we derive are still most likely very close to the actual best fit parameters , and all four fits in the previous section came out with similar results for @xmath5 and the viscous frequency radial dependence . while the change in @xmath5 is predicted from the truncated disc / hot inner flow geometry proposed to model the correlated spectral changes , the change in viscous frequency radial dependence is not .",
    "there are two ( at least ) scenarios in which this could occur .",
    "firstly , this could indicate that the viscous frequency is well approximated by a power law but that the form of this changes as the truncation radius moves inwards ( as assumed in ingram & done 2010 for the neutron star power spectra ) .",
    "there is currently no theoretical model in which this occurs .",
    "a more attractive ( to us ) possibility is that a power law is a poor approximation for the viscous frequency and , as the truncation radius moves , the power law that best approximates the true shape of the viscous frequency with radius changes .",
    "this would imply that there is a stationary function @xmath188 ( and by extension @xmath189 ) which would allow this model to fit all 5 observations with only a change in @xmath5 .",
    "we note that exactly this behavior is predicted in global simulations of an adaf as the flow has to accelerate strongly to pass through a sonic point ( e.g. narayan , kato & honma 1997 ; gammie & popham 1998 ) .",
    "these models give an in - fall velocity @xmath189 which is well approximated by a quadratic in log space ( see fig 1 in gammie & popham 1998 ) .",
    "this will also allow the model to display a drop off in surface density in agreement with simulations as discussed in section [ sec : qpo ] .",
    "approximating such a velocity law by a power law of index @xmath56 will result in @xmath56 increasing as the radial extent of the flow decreases , similar to the observed trend .",
    "we will explicitly fit such models in a later paper ( ingram & done in preparation ) .",
    "the truncated disc / hot inner flow model designed to describe the spectral evolution of bhb can also give a self consistent geometry in which to model the correlated evolution of the power spectrum .",
    "propagating fluctuations through a hot flow which extends from and outer to inner radius , @xmath190 , can produce the band limited noise characteristic of the continuum power spectrum , as well as producing the rms - flux relation ( l97 ; k01 ; au06 ) .",
    "lense thirring precession of this _ same _ hot flow can produce the qpo , with frequency set by the _",
    "same _ parameters of @xmath5 and @xmath38 , together with the surface density of the flow ( idf09 ) .",
    "the surface density is itself given self consistently by mass conservation from the propagating fluctuations .",
    "this predicts that the surface density fluctuates , so predicts that the qpo frequency will vary on short timescales ( i.e. that it is a quasi rather than true period ) .",
    "these fluctuations set an upper limit to the coherence of the qpo , and this increases ( i.e. width decreases ) as @xmath5 decreases .",
    "this is due to the decrease in fluctuation power due to the smaller range of radii from which to pick up variability .",
    "all these features are well known properties of the data ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; dgk07 ) : this model gives the first quantitative description of their origin .",
    "the fluctuations also predict that the flux and qpo frequency are correlated on short timescales , as a perturbation in the surface density at large radii leads to a longer qpo frequency but has little effect on the luminosity .",
    "as this propagates down , it weights the mass distribution to smaller radii , increasing the qpo frequency but also increasingly contributing to the luminosity due to the centrally peaked emissivity .",
    "this behavior has also recently been observed ( heil et al 2011 ) .",
    "the model also gives a framework in which to interpret some otherwise very puzzling aspects of the energy dependence of the variability seen in bhb .",
    "the extended emission region can be inhomogeneous , with different parts of the flow producing a different spectrum .",
    "the outermost parts of the flow are closest to the cool disc , so will intercept more seed photons and have a softer spectrum than that produced in the more photon - starved inner part of the flow ( kawabata & mineshige 2010 ; makishima et al 2008 ; takahashi et al 2008 ) .",
    "this implies that a larger fraction of the lower energy compton scattered photons come from larger radii in the flow than the higher energy ones .",
    "the higher frequency variability is preferentially produced at the smallest radii , where the spectrum is hardest .",
    "the flow at these small radii is also furthest from the cool disc , so has little reflection spectrum superimposed on the compton continuum .",
    "thus the model predicts that the fastest variability has the hardest spectrum and smallest reflected fraction , while slower variability has a softer spectrum and larger reflected fraction .",
    "this trend is also observed in the data ( revnivtsev et al 1999 ) , and is very difficult to interpret in any other geometric picture as the inner disc edge can not change in radius on even the longest timescale ( few seconds ) over which this relation is seen .    similarly , the propagating fluctuations model means that a fluctuation starts at larger radii and then accretes down to smaller radii .",
    "thus the fluctuation first affects the region producing a softer spectrum , then propagates down to smaller radii which produce the harder spectrum , so the hard band lags the soft band .",
    "the size of this lag depends on the frequency of fluctuations considered .",
    "slow fluctuations ( low frequencies ) are produced at the outermost radius , so have the longest propagation time down to the innermost radius .",
    "high frequencies are produced only close to the inner radius , so only have a short distance to travel and hence have shorter lags .",
    "this gives rise to the frequency dependent time lags seen in the spectrum ( miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ; revnivtsev et al 2001 ; k01 ; au06 ) . in future work",
    ", we will quantitatively test these ideas against real data by incorporating a radial dependence of the emitted spectrum in our model , as well as putting in the more complex form for the radial dependence of the viscous frequency predicted from global adaf models and use improved fit statistics ( ingram & done , in preparation ) .",
    "we will also calculate the light curve shape predicted by lense - thirring precession of a hot inner flow , where the comptonised emission is modulated by the difference in projected area of the ( translucent ) hot flow , self occultation and variation in seed photons from the different projected area of the disc ( ingram , done & zycki in prep ) .",
    "this predicts non - sinusoidal variability in the light curve i.e. this predicts the harmonic structure of the qpo .    while the many successes of the model are clearly evident , it is also clear that it is still far from complete .",
    "the most obvious outstanding issues are of the interaction of the hot flow with the truncated disc .",
    "the mechanism by which the cool disc truncates is not well established , though evaporation powered by thermal conduction between the two different temperature fluids almost certainly plays some role in this ( liu et al 1997 ; rozanska & czerny 2000 ; mayer & pringle 2007 ) .",
    "whatever the mechanism , it seems physically unlikely that this will give a smooth transition between a cool thin disc and the hot flow .",
    "any inhomogeneities will probably also be amplified by the difference in velocity between the disc and flow ( discs are close to keplarian , while the hot flow is strongly sub keplarian ) so there will be a shearing turbulent layer formed between them .",
    "recent results show that there is variability associated with the truncated disc at a few 10s of seconds in the low / hard state of the bright bhbs gx339 - 4 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( wilkinson & uttley 2009 ) , suggesting that there is considerable complexity in the disc truncation ( see also chiang et al 2010 ) .",
    "full numerical simulations of the mri in a composite truncated disc / hot inner flow geometry are probably required in order to show the effect of these",
    ". however , such simulations are way beyond current computer capabilities .",
    "a more tractable issue is the effect of relativity on the propagating fluctuations .",
    "near the black hole , light bending and time dilation should be important and consequently future versions of this model need to take these effects into account .",
    "the final goal should of course be the creation of a fully relativistic model which can produce a fourier resolved spectrum with both energy and time dependence such that we can test it against observations such as the psd , the energy spectrum , the lag spectrum , the cross spectrum etc .",
    "this is of course very ambitious but it is the only way we can genuinely achieve a full theoretical understanding of what drives mass accretion and emission in bhbs .",

    "here , we attempt to address some of the statistical problems encountered in section [ sec : data ] by focusing in on observation 4 as it is a particularly striking example .",
    "the fit for the stressed version of the model ( hereafter case 1 ) is plotted in the 4th panel from the top in figure [ fig : r - gammas ] and the fit for the stress free version ( hereafter case 2 ) is plotted in the 4th panel from top in figure [ fig : r - gammasf ] . by eye ,",
    "these fits both look excellent and are very difficult to tell apart .",
    "however , the rejection probability is @xmath174 for case 1 and @xmath185 for case 2 ! this is extremely confusing , especially considering that case 2 actually has a slightly lower @xmath155 ( @xmath191 compared to @xmath192 ) than case 1",
    "! we will also discuss the obvious over fitting implied by such low @xmath155 values later on in this section .        in an attempt to understand this discrepancy",
    ", we look a little closer at these two examples .",
    "it turns out that @xmath164 for case 2 is larger than in case 1 ( @xmath195 for case 2 ; @xmath196 for case 1 ) .",
    "although this sheds a little light on the mystery , it does nt explain such a huge descrepancy in rejection propbability .",
    "however , the @xmath163 values are all much smaller for case 2 meaning that the simulated values agree with each other much better than they do with the observed values , making it extremely unlikely that the observed points lie on the distribution of simulated points . in an attempt to see this difference",
    ", we plot all of the raw periodogram points for both cases in figure [ fig : scatter ] .",
    "the black and red points are observed and simulated respectively with case 1 on the top and case 2 on the bottom .",
    "we see that the two plots are indistinguishable .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dis2 ] , we have looked at 3 specific frequencies : @xmath197hz ( black ) , @xmath198hz ( green ) and @xmath199hz ( blue ) and created a histogram to see the distribution of periodogram values .",
    "note , the three distributions have been normalised to have a mean of @xmath147 and a standard deviation of @xmath200 for clarity . again",
    ", case 1 is on the top .",
    "although there are departures from gaussian behaviour in all of these distributions , it is clear that the distributions for case 2 are far more centrally peaked than those of case 1 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath163 being smaller in general for case 2 .",
    "there are also hints of baises which may account for the apparent over fitting implied by such small @xmath155 values .    in our analysis , we calculated the logarithmically smoothed periodogram over @xmath151 realisations in order to calculate and minimise @xmath155 .",
    "we did this because papadakis & lawrence ( 1993 ) show that the logarithmically smoothed periodogram can have a gaussian distribution if it is smoothed over more than @xmath154 realisations , in comparision to the smoothed periodogram ( i.e. no logarithms ) where you would need more than @xmath201 realisations .",
    "this implies that our logarithmically smoothed periodograms have a gaussian error distribution , therefore making @xmath155 an appropriate fit statistic . however , there are two problems with this , both arising because the error distribution depends on the underlying power spectrum .",
    "papadakis & lawrence ( 1993 ) were looking at red noise which is a significantly different variability process than that considered here .",
    "therefore , just because 20 realisations are enough for them , does nt mean it is enough for us .",
    "more significantly , the same authors show that the logarithmically smoothed periodogram may give a baised estimate of a power spectrum with a high curvature .",
    "since , we are simulating qpos , we are in this very regeim which could explain the hint of bais displayed in figure [ fig : dis2 ] .    for these reasons , in a future paper ( ingram & done in prep )",
    "we will use smoothed periodograms ( no logarithms ) and attempt to find a way around the resulting non - gaussian errors . to do this",
    ", we will consider statistical methods more general than @xmath155 but less computationally intensive than minimising the rejection probability .",
    "hopefully this will allows us to overcome these statistical problems ."
