    "<S> squeezing is a nonlinear gaussian operation that is the key component in construction of other nonlinear gaussian gates . in our implementation of the squeezing gate </S>",
    "<S> , the amount and the orientation of the squeezing can be controlled by an external driving signal with 1 mhz operational bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this opens a brand new area of dynamic gaussian processing . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the gate can be immediately employed as the feed - forward needed for the deterministic implementation of the quantum cubic gate , which is a key piece of universal quantum information processing .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum information processing with continuous variable systems ( cv ) has many tools . </S>",
    "<S> they could be divided into two broad categories  gaussian and non - gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian tools comprise of gaussian quantum states that can be represented by a gaussian wigner function , of gaussian measurements that project on gaussian states , and of gaussian operations that transform gaussian states into different gaussian states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - gaussian tools category then includes everything else . </S>",
    "<S> the non - gaussian category is much broader and much more powerful . </S>",
    "<S> there are many quantum information protocols that can not be implemented with gaussian tools alone , quantum computation @xcite , entanglement distillation @xcite , and error correction @xcite are just the three most prominent examples .    as a consequence , there is an understandable thirst for all matters non - gaussian . in quantum optics , which is the experimental platform of choice </S>",
    "<S> when it comes to tests of cv paradigms @xcite , the non - gaussian features need to come from interactions with discrete variable physical systems @xcite , or from discrete measurements @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . these two general approaches also differ with respect to quantum systems for which they can be applied . while the interaction with discrete variable systems is best realized by a standing wave mode in a resonator , the discrete projective measurements work better with traveling light . and here comes another distinction . </S>",
    "<S> the traveling modes of light are much more suitable for implementation of gaussian operations . </S>",
    "<S> this is significant , because the non - gaussian resources are useful only when the gaussian tools are refined enough to operate without a hitch . to present a specific example , consider the issue of universal quantum information processing . in cv </S>",
    "<S> world this means the ability to implement a unitary operation with an arbitrary hamiltonian @xcite . for this </S>",
    "<S> we need to have access to the cubic operation  a quantum operation with hamiltonian composed of third power of quadrature operators  _ as well as _ the complete range of gaussian operations .    </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian states , operations , and measurements are the foundations on which the cv quantum information processing is built . </S>",
    "<S> homodyne detection , squeezed states and gaussian linear operations in the form of displacement and passive linear optics are already staples of the contemporary experimental practice . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement induced paradigm @xcite , which employs the passive linear optics together with squeezed states and linear feed - forward , then in turn allowed implementation of the gaussian nonlinear operations such as squeezing @xcite , quantum non - demolition interaction @xcite , and others @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these past implementations have one thing in common . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity was static . </S>",
    "<S> this is not too big of a problem for the contemporary proof - of - principle experiments that are built to implement a single specific task . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to move towards universal and _ fast _ information processing , we need operations with bandwidth higher than what is allowed by ` manual ' change of optical elements . </S>",
    "<S> the most immediate examples are the proposed experimental implementation of the cubic gate @xcite and the experimental preparation of the cubic state @xcite , both of which can be considered to be the important first step towards universal quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> these applications require a nonlinear feed - forward  a squeezing operation whose strength and direction depend on measurement results . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present the experimental realization of such the operation for a mode of traveling light . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that the operation can be used as a part of a larger information processing network , for example as a feed - forward in the implementation of a cubic phase gate @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the implemented operation is a time - dependent nonlinear gaussian operation with an effective hamiltonian @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this operation is in each instant applied to a different input quantum state @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the strength of the quadratic operation , and @xmath3 is the quadrature operator of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the operation transforms the pair of quadrature operators as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , which can be decomposed into a sequence of a phase shift , a squeezing , and another phase shift ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we employ a streamlined experimental configuration that implements the desired transformation up to a constant local squeezing , that could be effectively compensated by the existing methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is depicted in figure  [ dsgschematic.eps](a ) and in the ideal case it works in the following way : after we combine the input state @xmath1 with the @xmath6-eigenstate @xmath7 at a balanced beamsplitter , we measure the quadrature @xmath8 of one of the modes by controlling the phase of the local oscillator ( lo ) of homodyne detection ( hd ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 depends on the external driving signal as @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the measured value @xmath11 to apply @xmath12-displacement to the unmeasured mode with electronic gain of @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> this is exactly the desired form . in reality </S>",
    "<S> , we need to approximate the @xmath6-eigenstate @xmath7 with a squeezed vacuum state that can be for our purposes completely characterized by its @xmath6-quadrature variance @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> eventually we can derive the actual input - output relations to be    @xmath17                + \\frac{\\kappa(t)}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\hat{x}_\\text{s}(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ nffio ]    where @xmath18 denotes the @xmath6-quadrature of the squeezed vacuum state and vanishes in the limit of infinite squeezing represented by @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> the input - output relations can be verified by applying the operation to a set of coherent states with differing amplitudes . in our experiment , we have chosen our input to consist of @xmath6-displaced coherent states , whose amplitudes were changed in time . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to analyze the dynamic behavior with respect to both the gate parameter and the input state . in practical scenarios </S>",
    "<S> we can assume that the control signal is changing more slowly than the input state . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath20 is nonzero in the time interval , the state is displaced in the @xmath23-direction proportionally to its initial displacement in the @xmath22-direction , and it is also squeezed . the amount and the direction of the squeezing both depend on the value of @xmath20 .        </S>",

    "<S> ( this technique was previously employed in the experiment of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) on the other hand , the ancillary squeezed state is prepared by an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) . </S>",
    "<S> this opo is a bow - tie - shaped cavity of 300 mm in length , containing a periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath25 crystal to obtain second - order nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> the opo is pumped by a beam with the wavelength of 430 nm and the power of 120 mw , which is generated by another bow - tie - shaped cavity ( shg ) containing a knbo@xmath26 crystal . </S>",
    "<S> bandwidth of the opo is 12.5 mhz in terms of half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) so that our setup sufficiently covers bandwidth of the input coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> the typical squeezing level from dc to 10 mhz was @xmath273.1 db . after the state preparations , we couple the input and the squeezed vacuum at a balanced beamsplitter ( 50:50 ) , measuring one port of the outputs by a homodyne detector ( hd1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the phase @xmath21 of the local oscillator ( lo1 ) is controlled by an eom to follow the signal @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> the maximal antisqueezing starts from about 3 db where the control signal vanishes , and it reaches about 7 db with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> for the maximal squeezing , it starts from about @xmath271.3 db and reaches about @xmath271.8 db . </S>",
    "<S> while these values are reduced from those of the ideal case due to the finite squeezing of the ancillary states , they still show dependency on the control signal and well agree with theoretical predictions ( dashed curves ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally demonstrated a squeezing operation whose squeezing level and squeezing direction can be continuously adjusted with an operational bandwidth of 1 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamic squeezing gate can allow implementation of an arbitrary dynamic gaussian gate @xcite and it significantly expands the possibilities of teleportation - based quantum operations . on a more immediate time scale , the squeezing gate is now ready to serve as the feed - forward part of the cubic phase gate @xcite . </S>",
