    "radio surveys are a cornerstone of modern astronomy . counts of extragalactic radio sources per steradian per unit flux density provide fundamental constraints on galaxy evolution , as they implicitly encapsulate both the underlying redshift and luminosity distributions of source populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in total intensity",
    ", the 1.4  ghz source counts are observed to flatten below 1  mjy , though the extent of this flattening is controversial because the results from deep surveys exhibit a large degree of scatter .",
    "to illustrate , see the compilation of surveys in fig .  3 from @xcite where there is a factor of 2 variation in the counts below 1  mjy .",
    "some studies have attributed the large scatter in the faint counts to cosmic variance , namely to intrinsic differences between survey fields caused by source clustering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , significant differences in the counts for fields observed by separate studies , such as the lockman hole @xcite , indicate that calibration and data processing errors may be largely responsible for the scatter .",
    "issues to consider include corrections for bandwidth smearing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , eddington bias ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resolution bias ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and non - instrumental factors such as source clustering in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the present conclusion in the literature is that the scatter in the sub - millijansky counts is likely to be significantly affected by data processing differences between surveys .",
    "this conclusion motivates the need for studies that describe data reduction and analysis procedures in detail , so as to facilitate robust comparisons with other works and encourage future improvements .    to date",
    ", very few surveys dedicated to extragalactic polarized radio sources have been conducted , primarily because of correlator limitations that have required polarization capabilities to be sacrificed for spectral resolution .",
    "polarization surveys at 1.4  ghz include the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observed with the very large array , which encompasses 82% of the sky at resolution full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) 45  to a root mean square ( rms ) sensitivity in polarization of 0.29  mjy  beam@xmath2 , surveys of the european large area",

    "a summary of polarization surveys at other radio wavelengths is presented by @xcite . by cross - matching",
    "polarized 1.4  ghz sources with mid - infrared counterparts , @xcite identified the population of polarized millijansky sources as being extragalactic radio sources powered by agns .",
    "@xcite found that the polarized emission from these sources was likely to originate in extended radio lobes .",
    "and @xcite found an anti - correlation between the fractional linear polarization and total intensity flux densities of nvss sources ; faint sources were more highly polarized .",
    "this finding was supported for elais - n1 sources by @xcite and @xcite , and for atlbs sources by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found that the euclidean - normalised differential number - counts of polarized sources flattened at linearly polarized flux densities @xmath7  @xmath8  1  mjy to levels greater than those predicted by @xcite ; the latter predicted polarized source counts to @xmath1jy levels by convolving total intensity source counts with a fractional polarization distribution modelled on nvss data .",
    "@xcite were unable to reproduce the observed flattening in a population modelling study .",
    "the observed flattening suggests the emergence of systematic changes in polarized source properties with decreasing flux density , such as higher ordering of magnetic fields in fainter sources , or perhaps the emergence of an unexpected faint population . to examine the emerging fractional polarization anti - correlation and source count flattening trends in more detail , deeper and higher angular resolution observations of the 1.4  ghz polarized sky are required .    in this work we present reprocessed and new 1.4  ghz observations of the _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdf - s ; galactic coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; * ? ? ? * ) and elais - south 1 ( elais - s1 ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) regions , obtained as part of the australia telescope large area survey ( atlas ) project with the atca .",
    "we collectively refer to these previous atlas papers as data release 1 ( dr1 ) and denote the present work data release 2 ( dr2 ) . given that dr1 did not include polarization analysis of the atlas data , we have chosen to reprocess the original observations to ensure consistent and improved data reduction and analysis between both the total intensity and polarization data and the two independent atlas regions . in preparation for atlas dr2 , we have developed new tools to ensure accurate calculation of the statistical significance of flux density measurements in linear polarization @xcite and to ensure accurate measurement of these flux densities using the blobcat source extractor @xcite .",
    "the motivations for atlas dr2 are to ( i ) present a detailed description of our data reduction and analysis procedures to inform future deep surveys such as those being developed for ska pathfinder facilities around the world ( see summary of facilities described by and @xcite ) , ( ii ) compute differential number counts for total intensity and linearly polarized objects ( total intensity counts were not included in dr1 ) , and ( iii ) investigate the nature of faint polarized sources and consider possible explanations for the fractional polarization trend seen in previous studies .",
    "clearly , biases introduced at an early stage of data reduction have the potential to propagate through to the final data in a non - linear fashion , affecting the ability for that data to be used for unplanned and novel experiments in the future ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper ( paper i ) we focus on point ( i ) from above , regarding data reduction and the development of new techniques to produce high fidelity data suitable for investigating points ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "results and discussion regarding points ( ii ) and ( iii ) will be presented in paper ii @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in   [ ch4:secobs ]",
    "we describe our atlas radio data and ancillary mid - infrared and optical data . in   [ ch4:secdat ] we outline our radio data reduction and post - processing procedures to obtain mosaicked images of total intensity , linear polarization ( using rotation measure synthesis ) , and additionally circular polarization for the two atlas regions . in   [ ch4:secinst ]",
    "we describe instrumental effects of time - average smearing , bandwidth smearing , and polarization leakage , our methods to account for them in our atlas data , and the effective survey area boundaries . in   [ ch4:secext ] we detail how radio components were detected and extracted in total intensity , linear polarization , and circular polarization , and how their flux densities were corrected to account for subtle noise - induced systematics . in   [ ch4:secclass ] we describe our implementation of two cross - identification and classification schemes : the first to group components into sources , to associate these sources with infrared sources , and to classify them according to their multiwavelength properties ; and the second to associate linearly polarized components or polarization upper limits with total intensity counterparts and to classify these associations based on their polarized morphologies . in   [ ch4:seccnc ] we describe in detail corrections required to calculate total intensity and linear polarization differential number - counts , including a new fully analytic method to account for resolution bias . in   [ ch5:secres ]",
