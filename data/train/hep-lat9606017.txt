    "the action for the electroweak sector of the standard model has su(2)@xmath6u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "if we consider the su(2 ) part and take the limit in which gauge degrees of freedom are frozen , the resulting action is the o(4 ) non linear @xmath7 model , which has been extensively studied because its spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern is related to the one exhibited by su(2 ) in four dimensions .    the regularized version of the o(4 ) @xmath7 model on the lattice leads to an interacting continuum limit for @xmath8 @xcite , while for @xmath9 the theory is described by free bosonic fields @xcite .",
    "at the upper critical dimension , @xmath10 , deviations from mean field theory ( mft ) are expected .",
    "the mft predictions for the scaling of thermodynamic quantities are corrected by multiplicative logarithmic terms @xcite .",
    "perturbatively the infrared fixed point of the callan - symanzik function @xmath11 moves to the origin as the dimension becomes four @xcite , also the fixed point is now a double zero ( in contrast with the @xmath8 case ) which is responsible for the occurrence of such logarithmic corrections .",
    "the existence of these corrections imply the triviality of the theory @xcite .",
    "triviality seems to persist when gauge fields are included @xcite .",
    "the common feature of all these approaches to the so - called triviality problem @xcite , is that the self - interactions of the scalar field in the broken phase are weak , and they can be reasonably studied within the context of perturbation theory .",
    "it is generally believed that the perturbative and the strong coupling regime belong to the same universality class .",
    "however , for the non - perturbative strong coupling regime a rigorous proof is still lacking and we have to rely on numerical simulations @xcite    the existence of a strongly interacting higgs sector , with a complicated dynamics , rendering useless perturbation theory , is a possibility not to be discarded a priori . a large amount of work",
    "have been done actually in order to know whether or not non - perturbative effects could change the physics of the electro - weak symmetry breaking sector ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this sense , concerning the universality class of the rp@xmath12 models , the role of non - perturbative effects needs to be clarified @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetism ( af ) has been considered in a great variety of models in order to find properties not present in the purely ferromagnetic ( fm ) systems @xcite in the context of high @xmath13 superconductivity , af seems to play an essential role .",
    "the transition from paramagnetic to non purely fm ordered phases has been studied in two dimensional models @xcite .    in four dimensions , in diluted systems recently new critical exponents have been obtained @xcite . also in @xmath14 a previous study of the af ising model @xcite shows the existence of an af phase non trivially equivalent to the standard fm one .",
    "however no new critical behavior was evidenced in this work .",
    "also in four dimensions , competing interactions have been considered in order to study the multicritical point of the yukawa models . at this multicritical point",
    "four phases meet ( fm , af , ferrimagnetic and pm ) .",
    "the question of whether or not it would be possible to define a non - trivial continuum limit at this point remains still an open problem @xcite .",
    "it is not clear the role that af can play in the formulation of qft , nevertheless it is worthwhile a careful study of this kind of models since they are known to have very rich phase diagrams , and presumably new universality classes could appear in which alternative formulations of continuum qft should be possible .",
    "however , when defining a theory with af couplings one has to be aware of the fact that higher order derivatives tends to violate reflection positivity @xcite .",
    "a possibility is to perform an appropriate tuning of the couplings in order to cancel the contributions coming from unphysical ( negative norm ) states .",
    "the inclusion of gauge fields can change the situation @xcite , but it is worthwhile as a probe to see what happens in this limit when negative couplings are included , postponing for a future study the effect of gauge fields .",
    "in this work we study how the existence of opposite couplings influence the vacuum of the theory , specifically , whether or not the ground state ( @xmath15 ) is frustrated ( the energy can not be minimized simultaneously for all couplings ) or even disordered ( non zero vacuum entropy ) .",
    "our starting point is the non - linear @xmath7 model , with action :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a 4-component vector with fixed modulus @xmath18 .",
    "the naive way to introduce af in the non - linear @xmath7 model is to consider a negative coupling . in this case",
    "the state with minimal energy for large @xmath19 is a staggered vacuum . on a hypercubic lattice , if we denote the coordinates of site @xmath20 as @xmath21 , making the transformation @xmath22 the system with negative @xmath19",
    "is mapped onto the positive @xmath19 one , both regions being exactly equivalent .    therefore to consider true af we must take into account either different geometries or more couplings , in order to break the symmetry under the transformation ( [ mapping ] ) . in four dimensions",
    "the simplest option is to add more couplings , we have chosen to add a coupling between points at a distance of @xmath23 lattice units .    following this",
    "we will consider a system of spins \\{@xmath24 } taking values in the hyper - sphere @xmath25 and placed in the nodes of a cubic lattice .",
    "the interaction is defined by the action @xmath26    the transformation ( [ mapping ] ) maps the semi - plane @xmath27 onto the @xmath28 , and therefore only the region with @xmath29 will be considered . on the line @xmath3 the system decouples in two @xmath4 independent sublattices .",
    "when @xmath30 the model is known to present a continuous transition between a disordered phase , where o(4 ) symmetry is exact , to an ordered phase where the o(4 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken to o(3 ) .",
    "this transition is second order , being the critical exponents those of mft : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "the critical coupling for this case can be studied analytically by an expansion in powers of the coordination number ( @xmath36 ) , being @xmath37 @xcite .    from a mean field analysis",
    ", we observe that for @xmath38 the behavior of the system will not change qualitatively from the @xmath30 case but with higher coordination number .",
    "in fact , taking into account that the energy ( for non - frustrated systems ) is approximately proportional to the coordination number , there will be a transition phase line whose approximate equation is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the quotient between the number of second and first neighbors .",
    "this line can be thought as a prolongation of the critical point at @xmath30 so the transitions on this line are expected to be second order with mft exponents .",
    "this is also the behavior of the two couplings ising model in this region @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 , the presence of two couplings with opposite sign makes frustration to appear , and very different vacua are possible .",
    "we define the energy associated to each coupling : @xmath41 @xmath42    in terms of these energies , the action reads @xmath43    it is useful to define the energies per bound as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the lattice volume . with this normalization @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 belong to the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "we have computed the configurations which minimize the energy for several asymptotic values of the parameters .",
    "we have only considered configurations with periodicity two .",
    "more complex structures have not been observed in our simulations .",
    "considering only the @xmath49 case , we have found the following regions :    1 .",
    "paramagnetic ( pm ) phase or disordered phase , for small absolute values of @xmath50 .",
    "2 .   ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase .",
    "it appears when @xmath51 is large and positive .",
    "+ when the fluctuations go to zero , the vacuum takes the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an arbitrary element of the hyper - sphere .",
    "+ concerning the definition of the order parameter let us remark that because of tunneling phenomena in finite lattice we are forced to use pseudo - order parameters for practical purposes .",
    "such quantities behave as true order parameters only in the thermodynamical limit . in the fm phase , we define the standard ( normalized ) magnetization as + @xmath54 + and we use as pseudo - order parameter the square root of the norm of the magnetization vector @xmath55 this quantity has the drawback of being non - zero in the symmetric phase but it presents corrections to the bulk behavior order @xmath56 .",
    "3 .   hyper - plane antiferromagnetic phase ( hpaf ) .",
    "it corresponds to large @xmath0 , with @xmath1 in a narrow interval ( @xmath57 $ ] in the mean field approximation ) . in this region",
    "the vacuum correspond to spins aligned in three directions but anti - aligned in the fourth ( @xmath58 ) . + in absence of fluctuations the associated vacuum would be @xmath59 , where @xmath58 can be any direction , and @xmath60 any vector on s@xmath61 .",
    "+ we define an _ ad hoc _ order parameter for this phase as @xmath62 + @xmath63 will be different from zero only in the hpaf phase , where the system becomes antiferromagnetic on the @xmath58 direction . from the four order parameters ( one for every possible value of @xmath58 ) only one of them will be different from zero in the hpaf phase .",
    "so , we define as the pseudo order parameter : @xmath64 4 .",
    "plane anti - ferromagnetic ( paf ) phase for @xmath1 large and negative . in this region",
    "the ground state is a configuration with spins aligned in two directions and anti - aligned in the remaining two .",
    "it is characterized with by one of the six combinations of two different directions ( @xmath65 ) , and an arbitrary spin @xmath53 : @xmath66 . for the paf region",
    "we first define @xmath67 + and the quantity we measure is @xmath68    in order to avoid undesirable ( frustrating ) boundary effects for ordered phases , we work with even lattice side @xmath69 as periodic boundary conditions are imposed .    from this data",
    "we can compute the derivatives of any observable with respect to the couplings as the connected correlation function with the energies @xmath70    an efficient method to determine @xmath71 for a second order transition is to measure the binder cumulant @xcite for various lattice size and to locate the cross point in the space of @xmath19 .    for o(@xmath72 ) models",
    "@xmath73 takes the form @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is an order parameter for the transition .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the slope of @xmath73 at @xmath71 increases with @xmath69 .",
    "the value of the binder cumulant is closely related with the triviality of the theory since the renormalized coupling ( in the massless thermodynamical limit ) at zero momentum can be written as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the correlation length in the size @xmath69 lattice .    from this point of view triviality",
    "is equivalent to have a vanishing @xmath80 in the thermodynamical limit . in this context",
    "it is clear that we can use the value of @xmath80 to classify the universality class . out of the upper critical dimension",
    ", @xmath81 is a constant at @xmath71 since @xmath82 , and we could use the binder cumulant for the same purpose @xcite . at the upper critical dimension , @xmath79 presents logarithmic corrections and @xmath81 is no longer a constant at @xmath71 . for the fm o(4 ) model in @xmath10 ( upper critical dimension ) we have perturbatively @xmath83 @xcite . in order to have a non trivial theory ,",
    "the binder cumulant should behave as a positive power of @xmath84 , but from its definition @xcite we see that @xmath85 .",
    "this is just another way of stating the perturbative triviality of the fm o(4 ) model .      in the @xmath87 case the system decouples in two independent lattices , each one constituted by the first neighbors of the other .",
    "so we consider two lattices with @xmath4 geometry .",
    "there are several reasons to choose the point @xmath88 for a careful study of the pm - paf transition .",
    "the region with @xmath89 evolve painfully with our local algorithms ; for small @xmath0 we expect very large correlation in mc time because the interaction between both sublattices is very small , and the response of one lattice to changes in the other is very slow .",
    "we also remark that the presence of two almost decoupled lattices is rather unphysical .",
    "we also have the experience from a previous work for the ising model @xcite that the correlation length at its first order transition is smaller in the @xmath4 lattice , that means , we can find asymptotic critical behavior in smaller lattices .",
    "however we should point out that the results in the @xmath4 lattice can not be easily extrapolated to a neighborhood of the @xmath0 axis .",
    "certainly , the geometry of the model is very modified when @xmath90 , and perhaps continuity arguments present problems .",
    "nevertheless , we have run also the case @xmath91 , and as occurs in the ising model we have not found qualitative differences .    in the following when we refer to the size of the lattice @xmath69 on the @xmath4 lattice we mean a lattice with @xmath92 sites .",
    "we have to find the configurations that maximize @xmath93 in order to define appropriate order parameters for the phase transition .",
    "the system has a very complex structure .",
    "as starting point we have studied numerically the vacuum with @xmath94 . for this values we have found in the simulation :    1 .",
    "the vacuum has periodicity two . to check this ,",
    "we have defined : @xmath95 where @xmath96 stands for the @xmath97 vertex of each @xmath98 hypercube belonging to the @xmath4 lattice , and with @xmath99 we denote the @xmath98 hypercubes themselves .",
    "+ from these vectors we can define the 8 magnetizations associated to the elementary cell , @xmath100 + we have checked that all @xmath101 tends to 1 for the ordered phase in the thermodynamical limit , so we conclude that the ordered vacua have periodicity two .",
    "+ let us remark for the sake of completeness that all order parameters we have defined can be written as an appropriate linear combination of the @xmath102 .",
    "2 .   in the elementary cell , @xmath103 @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "so , in this section we will restrict the study of the vacuum structure to the four sites ( @xmath106 ) belonging to the cube in the hyper - plane @xmath107 .",
    "we have measured the energy per bound associated to the second neighbors coupling .",
    "we check that in the thermodynamical limit @xmath108 .",
    "4 .   if we choose the symmetry breaking direction by keeping fix one vector , ( eg .",
    "@xmath109 ) we find : @xmath110    the vacuum structure is not completely fixed by these three conditions since different symmetry breaking patterns are possible .",
    "for instance , a configuration @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , with * @xmath115 * a 3-component unitary vector with the constraint @xmath116 , breaks o(4 ) , but an o(2 ) symmetry remains ( for the different * @xmath115 * ) .    to determine which is the vacuum in presence of fluctuations , we consider four independent fields in a @xmath98 cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "let us first consider an o(@xmath117 ) group .",
    "we can study the four vectors as a mechanical system of mass - less links of length unity , rotating in a plane around the same point , whose extremes are attached with a spring of natural length zero .",
    "the energy for the system is :    @xmath118    we consider the fluctuation matrix , @xmath119 in order to find the normal modes .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath120 take the form :    @xmath121    in the fm case the minimum correspond to @xmath122 , for all @xmath123 .",
    "there is a single zero mode , and a three times degenerated non - zero mode with eigenvalue @xmath124 .    for the af ( maximum energy ) case",
    ", the maximum energy is found , up to permutations , at @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath130 freedom that corresponds to the global o(2 ) symmetry , there is a degeneration of the vacuum in the @xmath131 angle and this zero mode is double @xmath129 .",
    "the other two eigenvalues are @xmath132 , so , an additional zero mode appears when @xmath31 , obtaining in this case a three fold degenerated zero mode corresponding to : @xmath133 .",
    "the o(4 ) case is qualitatively similar .",
    "we have 12 degrees of freedom . of all configurations that minimize the energy , that with a largest degeneration ( 9-times ) consist of 2 spins aligned and 2 anti - aligned that correspond to a paf vacuum .",
    "we consider this degeneration as the main difference with the fm sector , and could be relevant to obtain different critical exponents .    in presence of fluctuations",
    "the configurations with largest degeneration are favored by phase space considerations , so we expect that the real vacuum is a paf one",

    "we remark that usually the main source of statistical error in the measures of magnetic exponents is the error in the determination of the coupling where to measure .",
    "however , using eq .",
    "( [ quotient ] ) we can take into account the correlation between the measures of the observable and the measure of the coupling where the cross occurs .",
    "this allows to reduce the statistical error in an order of magnitude .",
    "it is well known that @xmath10 is the upper critical dimension of the fm o(4 ) model . as we have already pointed out logarithmic corrections to the mean",
    "field predictions are expected .",

    "for the magnetic exponents , the situation is more involved . in principle",
    ", one can think that they disagree from mft due to logarithmic corrections .",
    "we have no perturbative predictions about the form in which these corrections would affect @xmath79 for the af case .",
    "however , one expects that such corrections slightly modify the critical exponents , as occurs in the fm case . it could be possible that logarithmic corrections modify largely the previous critical exponents and drift them to the fm ones . to sort this out ,",
    "we have considered the possibility of a behavior fm like , so that @xmath207 . in the lower part of table [ table_expo ]",
    "we quote the values of the critical exponents for the paf phase transition when logarithmic corrections are included ( formula ( [ quolog ] ) ) .",
    "we see how in effect the magnetic critical exponents are too far from the classical ones for being the result of a logarithmic correction to the mft predictions .",
    "it is interesting to compare this situation with that in the rp@xmath208 model in @xmath14 @xcite where small deviations from mft exponents can be explained as logarithmic corrections .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of the four dimensional o(4 ) model with first and second neighbors couplings . for @xmath2",
    "we find a region non - trivially related with the fm one , in which the system is af ordered in some plane .",
    "the phase transition between the disordered region and this paf region seems to be second order .",
    "we also compute the critical exponents on this line at @xmath87 ( @xmath4 lattice ) by means of fss techniques .",
    "we found that up to @xmath153 the exponents are in disagreement with the mean field predictions .",
    "specifically , from our @xmath209 estimation ( or @xmath171 using hyper - scaling relation ) the exponent @xmath210 associated with the anomalous dimension of the field is @xmath211 .",
    "this fact itself would imply the non - triviality of the theory because green functions would not factorize anymore .",
    "one can not discard that the observed behavior were transitory .",
    "however , the stability of our measure of @xmath209 for lattice sizes ranging from @xmath158 to @xmath153 , which are more than a hundred of standard deviations apart the mf value , makes very unlikely this hypothesis . actually , it would be possible to obtain triviality also with a logarithmic exponent in equation ( [ quolog ] ) different from 1/4 .",
    "we can fix the critical exponents to its mf value and compute this parameter from the numerical data .",
    "the results obtained shown a non asymptotic behavior , with values ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 for the lattices used .",
    "a logarithmic fit is not satisfactory because of the non - asymptoticity and the large value of the logarithmic exponent , but larger lattices sizes are needed in order to get a more conclusive answer .",
    "the behavior of the specific heat does not show any first order signature , but we have been not able to obtain a reliable estimation of the @xmath131 exponent .",
    "we have also measured the binder cumulant at the critical point , finding that it stays almost constant when increasing the lattice size .",
    "if this is not a transient effect , and logarithmic corrections are finally ruled out , it would correspond a nonzero value of the renormalized constant in the thermodynamical limit .",
