    "planets are not alone . for example , most of the planets in the solar system have surrounding satellites or moons ; not only some asteroids , but also many of the kuiper belt objects ( e.g. , pluto and charon ) are in binaries ; and recent observations have also revealed miscellaneous exoplanetary worlds , including multi - planetary systems ( e.g. , kepler-11 , hd 10180 , gliese 581 ; @xcite ) . although the existence of exomoons or binary exoplanets have not been detected , various detection methods have been proposed , such as through transit light curves , transit timing and duration variations , direct imaging , microlensing , or doppler spectroscopy of the host planet ( e.g. , @xcite ; and references therein ) . in this paper , we investigate possible observational signatures that a binary exoplanet system ( if any ) or an exoplanet plus one moon system would have on the rossiter - mclaughlin ( r - m ) effect @xcite and how the orbital configurations of the system could be revealed through the signatures . for simplicity ,",
    "below we also call the one exoplanet plus one moon system as a binary planet , although the two components have very different masses . existence of binary planets and statistics on their dynamical configurations should shed new light on the formation and evolution of planetary systems and the search for a habitable world .    when a planet transits in front of a rotating star , it blocks part of the light emitted from the stellar surface , and the blocked region shifts with the transiting of the planet . as different parts of the stellar surface may have different line - of - sight velocities to the observer , the shifting of the blocked region results in either blueshift or redshift of observed stellar spectral lines and further the deviation of the inferred radial velocity of the stellar motion ( i.e. , the r - m effect )",
    ". the deviation of the stellar radial velocity provides a way to measure the misalignment between the stellar spin and the planetary orbital angular momentum , and recent measurements of the r - m effects have found that some exoplanets are on highly inclined orbits relative to the spin of the star ( e.g. , retrograde or polar orbits ; @xcite ) . for the similar reasons ,",
    "if the transiting planet is a binary , the binary with different physical properties and orbital configurations ( e.g. , radii , inclination ) may block the stellar surface in different ways , and hence the shift of stellar spectral lines and the deviation of its radial velocity curve may have different signatures from those expected from the transit of one single planet .",
    "the gravitation from a binary planet is also different from that from one single planet with the same total mass , but the resulted deviation in the dynamical motion of the star is generally small within each transit duration ( see justification in section  [ subsec : observation ] below ) . in this paper , we isolate and illustrate the effects on the observed stellar radial velocity due to the different light blocking ways .",
    "most of the modeling of the r - m effect for planetary systems were developed for a single planet rotating around a star .",
    "the r - m effect for exomoon systems was numerically modeled by @xcite , where the exomoon has a much smaller mass and radius than its host planet and the moon effects are modeled as a small perturbation added to the effect caused by a single planet .",
    "their modeling includes the fitting to the numerous dynamical parameters of the systems , including instantaneously and fast evolving ones . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis and investigation on the r - m effect for a binary planet system , where the satellite mass is not limited to be small but can be comparable to the host planet mass . we include the effects from the dynamical evolution of the binary planet system during multiple transits and their different dynamical configurations .",
    "our detailed treatments average out the effects from some instantaneously changing dynamical angles and include the evolutionary patterns of those relatively fast changing ones , so that we can focus on the effects from different inner orbital inclinations of the binary planet relative to its orbit rotating around the central star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "geometry ] , we describe the geometric configuration of the system to be studied in this paper ( i.e. , a binary planet transiting in front of a star ) and related dynamical approximations . in section  [ sec : rm ] , we investigate how the r - m effect is affected by a binary planet and how the different orbital configurations could be inferred from the deviation of the stellar radial velocity curves , together with the transit of the stellar light curves .",
    "we explore the parameter space of binary planets that are likely to be revealed in observations .",
    "we also extend the results to hierarchical triple star systems in which a binary star ( e.g. , a compact stellar remnant plus a brown dwarf or planet ) is transiting in front of a tertiary star gravitationally bound to the system .",

    "b.   if the angle @xmath34 is about in the range from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , the kozai mechanism affects the evolution of the orbital parameters of the inner binary , in which the angle @xmath34 and the eccentricity @xmath29 exchange at a period @xmath61 due to angular momentum transfer and the conservation of the quantity @xmath62 ( see an example shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ftheta ] below ) . during the oscillation",
    ", the eccentricity of the inner binary can be induced to high values close to 1 , and thus the inner binary is likely to be destroyed by collision of its two components .",
    "if there exist other moons in the system , one component of the binary is also likely to be ejected from the system or collide with one of the moons .",
    "the jovian system is such an example influenced by the kozai mechanism , and almost all the inclinations of their moons are out of the angle range . here",
    "we ignore other effects from the planet ( e.g. , tides , the general relativistic effect ) , which would limit the influence of the kozai mechanism .",

    "when a binary planet transits in front of a star ( see a schematic diagram in fig .  [ fig : transit ] ) , the stellar light curves may be imprinted with signatures of the binary planet .",

    "we use a full three - body simulation to obtain the dynamical motion of the system .",
    "the dynamical motion of the binary planet relative to the star determines the shifting of the blocked region during the transit .",
    "the following phases during the transit are illustrated in figures  [ fig : transit ] and [ fig : example ] .",
    "* ingress phase : at the beginning of the transit , at least one component of the binary planet starts to block the stellar light , but the projected areas of the two components have not been fully enclosed by the projected stellar surface ( e.g. , the `` ac '' part in fig .  [",

    "* complete transit phase of the binary planet : both the projected areas of the two components have been fully enclosed by the projected stellar surface ( e.g. , the `` ce '' part in fig .

    "the @xmath69 can be roughly taken as a condition for the occurrence of this phase during the transit .",
    "if the binary planet has a sufficiently large @xmath31 , it is likely that during the transit , their orbital evolution leads to the evolution of their projected areas from non - overlap to overlap , and to non - overlap again , for which a `` bulge '' ( the `` dd@xmath70 '' part in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) are shown in the light curve .",
    "* egress phase : at least one component of the binary planet has transited to the other end of the projected stellar surface and its projected area is not fully enclosed by the projected stellar surface again ( e.g. , the `` ef '' part in fig .",

    "the transit of a binary is different from that of a single body .",
    "as illustrated above , the binary may enter or exit the transit one by one , or the projected areas of the two components may overlap , so that some special features can be shown in the transit light curve ( e.g. , some step changes or `` bulges '' ) . some properties of the binary planet ( e.g. , radii of its two components , and its angular velocity and semimajor axis if its @xmath31 is sufficiently fast ; @xcite ) can be extracted from the features . in addition , the transit duration variation and the transit timing variation measured from the light curves have also been proposed to obtain the exomoon mass and the semimajor axis of the moon s orbit @xcite .",
    "below we illustrate that the orbital configuration of the binary planet can be further constrained by the evolution curve of the observational stellar radial velocity .",
    "note that the velocity in figure  [ fig : example ] ( similarly in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] below ) is expressed in a dimensionless quantity , where the stellar parameters involved in the normalization could be non - trivial to estimate in realistic systems and would be done through other independent methods and abundant knowledge in stellar astrophysics .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", a binary planet may leave signature on the observational radial velocity of the star , as well as on its light curve . the apparent stellar radial velocity anomaly due to the blocking of the stellar light",
    "is given by v_*=-k [ eq : deltav ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath71 is the line - of - sight component of the spin angular velocity and may be observationally constrained from the stellar spectrum .",
    "applying equation ( [ eq : deltav ] ) to the example shown in figure  [ fig : example]a , we obtain the evolution curve of its corresponding radial velocity anomaly in figure  [ fig : example]b ( see also fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "below we demonstrate how the dynamical configuration of the binary planet is incorporated into the evolution curve of the stellar radial velocity anomaly . for simplicity , we consider the complete transit phase of the binary planet . and we analyze the case in which the projected areas of the two planets do not overlap , and the non - overlap is likely to be true during most of the transit time especially if @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",

    "this r - m effect due to the transit of a single planet has been used to extract those angles of some realistic exoplanetary systems . together with some assumption or observational evidence on the possible distribution of the inclination of the stellar spin @xmath16 , the orbital inclination of the planet relative to the stellar spin ( i.e. , the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath15 ) can be further statistically constrained ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "as seen from the equations above , not only the planet areas / sizes are involved in the r - m effect as for a single planet , but their masses or mass densities are also involved in the effect for a binary planet due to the relative motion of the two components of the binary , as the hidden areas of the stellar surface are affected by the relative positions of the binary components and the relative distance of each component from the center of mass of the binary ( cf . , eqs .",

    "the involvement of the extra ( mass density ) dimension in the study is useful especially considering that recent kepler observations have revealed the mass density of planets do span a large range .",
    "in addition , the r - m effect for the transit of a single planet is related with the orbital semimajor axis , but the semimajor axis @xmath21 of the outer binary is involved in the effect for a binary planet as shown in equation ( [ eq : deltavb1 ] ) because the transit time @xmath57 is affected by @xmath21 and a longer transit time leads to a larger change of the relative position of the binary components and further a larger deviation in the stellar radial velocity .    as seen from equation ( [ eq : fdeltavb ] ) ,",

    "it is easy to generalize the analysis above to include the light emission from the binary .",
    "if the transiting binary is a compact object ( e.g. , white dwarf or neutron star ) plus a planet / brown dwarf , the factor @xmath180 is up to 1 , and the @xmath181 can be much larger than that of binary planet system .",

    "as seen from the figure , the radial velocity anomaly caused by the rotational motion of the planet / brown dwarf around the compact object is much more significantly displayed either through the bulge / hill / trough features during the ingress / egress phase ( for panel a ) or in the sine - like curve during the complete transit phase .",
    "the values of @xmath87 can be comparable to @xmath85 .",
    "it is plausible to expect that the features of these curves are very useful to infer the dynamical configurations of the systems , as illustrated for binary planets above .",
    "a more detailed discussion on extracting the configurations is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "the properties of binary planets ( e.g. , mass , size , and semimajor axis ) can be constrained through their signatures on the transit light curves and stellar radial velocity curves .",
    "our analysis of the r - m effect for a binary planet during its complete transit phase show that effect is composed of two parts .",
    "the first part is the conventional one similar to the r - m effect from the transit of a single planet with the combined masses and projected areas of the binary components ( eq .  [ eq : deltavo1 ] ) ; and the second part is caused by the orbital rotation of the binary components , which may add a sine- or linear - mode deviation to the stellar radial velocity curve ( eq .",
    "[ eq : deltavb ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the discussion on the second part , and we find both the evolution of the orbital rotating phases and the precession of the binary orbital plane may lead to different amplitudes of the deviations in different transit events of the same system . the resulted distribution and dispersion of the deviations in multiple transit events",
    "can be used to extract the orbital configuration of the binary planet or even the inclination of its orbital plane relative to the plane of its center of mass rotating around the star ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ) .",
    "the second part of the r - m effect is more likely to be revealed if the binary components have different masses and mass densities , especially if the heavy one has a high mass density and the light one has a low density .",
    "for example , our calculations show that the signature can be up to several or several ten @xmath0 with the mass ratio @xmath183 up to @xmath184 , if the mass density ratio @xmath185 .",
    "a small and rocky exomoon with @xmath166 would cause a low @xmath127 less than @xmath0 .",
    "a strong signature may be caused if at least one of the components of the binary planet is a giant planet .",
    "note that stellar noises produced by oscillations , granulation phenomena , and activities could contribute to the change of stellar radial velocities with an amplitude up to @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but they have their own variation periods and patterns to be distinguished from the effect of binary planets , and some statistical methods can be developed to extract smaller signals from the noises .",
    "a long observation time would cover multiple transits of a binary planet , and a better statistics on the distribution of the deviation in the r - m effect could be potentially obtained . to trace the evolution of the geometric configuration of the system ,",
    "we need at least one period of the orbital angular momentum of the inner binary precessing around that of the outer binary .",
    "the precession period is roughly about @xmath106 times the orbital period of the outer binary . for the parameter space shown in figures  [ fig : deltavb1 ] and [ fig : deltavb2 ] , @xmath106 is generally less than @xmath186 ( cf . ,",
    "the @xmath149 curve , which can also be taken as a reference line for @xmath187 ) .",
    "the misalignment between the plane of the binary planet and its rotating plane around the star is one of fundamental parameters of the dynamical system .",
    "a large misalignment is likely to cause a large dispersion or different distribution of the deviations in the r - m effect .",
    "recent measurements have discovered that the orbit of a planet may be highly inclined to the stellar spin .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of those misaligned orbits , e.g. , kozai capture , planet - planet scattering , resonance capture by planet migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the different configurations / inclinations of binary planets ( see @xmath34 defined in table  [ tab : para ] ) , if detected in future , should be also useful in constraining formation mechanisms of binary planets or exomoons , and shed new light on our understanding the diversity of planetary systems .",
    "for example , different moon formation mechanisms may lead to their different kinematic distributions .",
    "moons formed from the disk material surrounding a planet are predicted to have prograde orbits , while those formed from gravitational capture / impacts / exchange interactions can have either prograde or retrograde orbits ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "it is also likely that the orbit of a moon could be affected by the later evolution of the system ( e.g. , by the later inner / outer migration of the outer / inner planets ) .",
    "regarding a binary planet system with comparable component masses , the study of their formation theory is starting ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and one of the most exciting steps would be to discover a realistic system in observations in the near future .    to discover binary planets and exomoons",
    "becomes promising and practical with future developments in instruments , which also lay the foundation for finding the signatures discussed in this paper .",
    "for example , planned ground - based surveys such as the _ large synoptic survey telescope _ may detect thousands to tens of thousands of planetary transit candidates ; and the space missions , _ planetary transits and oscillations of stars _ and _ transiting exoplanet survey satellite _",
    ", aim to find transiting planets around relatively bright stars , making it easier to confirm discoveries using follow - up radial velocity measurements .",
    "hopefully follow - up observations could provide some binary planet or exomoon candidates .",
    "the astro - comb technique is aiming to achieve a precision as high as @xmath159 in astronomical radial velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "@xcite also proposed a systematic search for exomoons around transiting exoplanet candidates observed by the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "we studied the basic signatures of binary planets that are likely to be revealed in the r - m effect . to understand the roles of the crucial parameters played in the signatures",
    ", we have made some approximations in our study , which could be improved or adapted to realistic systems in future work , for example , the study could be extended to a general case in which the center of mass of the binary planet is on an eccentric orbit .",
    "the study would become complicated if an exoplanet has multiple moons . in this case",
    ", the small moons would contribute little to the deviation in the r - m effect , and the one with a relatively large radius and located at a relatively far distance from the primary planet would imprint the most significant effect .",
    "the limb - darkening effect can reduce the amplitude of the r - m effect by 20 - 40 percent @xcite , and also affect the shape of the radial velocity anomaly ( for both the linear and the sine cases studied in this paper ) .",
    "this effect could be corrected with the aid of the observational transit light curves in reality . a statistical method to map",
    "the reconstruction of relevant parameters of a binary planet system is beyond the scope of this paper , but would need to be explored in details in future .    after extending the results to a hierarchical triple star system containing a dark binary and a tertiary star , the deviation in the r - m effect would be large enough to be detected especially if the dark binary is composed of a compact object and a brown dwarf / planet , which may put further constraints on the geometrical configuration of triple star systems and provide insights on their formation and evolution .",
