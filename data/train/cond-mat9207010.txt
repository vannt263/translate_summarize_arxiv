    "chaotic billiards have attracted much interest in recent years in the contexts of both classical chaos @xcite and quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a classical particle in various billiard geometries has been studied extensively and the mechanisms that produce chaos in such systems have been examined and classified . in particular , it was shown that for a class of billiard geometries that includes the stadium billiard the dynamics is ergodic @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanics of billiards which are chaotic in the classical limit has been studied .",
    "the statistical properties of energy spectra and the wave functions have been analyzed in an effort to characterize the quantum mechanical properties of such systems . among the remarkable phenomena that have been observed are the correspondence between the classical behavior and the distribution of nearest neighbor energy level spacings and the appearance of `` scars '' in the wave functions .",
    "unstable periodic orbits provide a useful and systematic framework for calculations both in the classical and the semiclassical regimes . in classical chaos",
    "these orbits can be used to calculate fractal dimensions , entropies and lyapunov exponents in a systematic fashion @xcite . in the semiclassical regime",
    "they can be applied to the calculation of the energy levels and wave functions using the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite .",
    "these studies provide important insights into the quantum mechanics of classically chaotic systems .",
    "they are also relevant to experiments on billiard shaped microwave cavities @xcite , to mesoscopic systems in the ballistic regime @xcite and to a variety of scattering problems @xcite .",
    "a systematic method for the calculation of unstable periodic orbits in discrete dissipative maps has been proposed recently and applied to the hnon map @xcite and the dissipative standard map @xcite . in this method one",
    "first identifies a symbolic dynamics for the system such that each periodic orbit is associated with a unique symbol sequence .",
    "then the periodic orbits can be calculated systematically by picking each symbol sequence and calculating the orbit associated with it .",
    "this way all the periodic orbits up to a given order can be obtained to a very good accuracy .    in this paper we extend the method and apply it to the calculation of unstable periodic orbits in the stadium billiard .",
    "we identify a useful symbolic dynamics for the stadium and verify its uniqueness numerically , using the results to calculate the topological entropy and the average lyapunov exponent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the method for calculation of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "we test the method in section iii and apply it to the calculation of average lyapunov exponent and the topological entropy .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section iv . in the appendix we provide a list of the geometrical pruning rules .",
    "in this section we describe the numerical technique for the calculation of unstable periodic orbits in chaotic billiards . we apply it to the stadium billiard and calculate all periodic orbits up to order 11 and selected orbits up to order 200 .",
    "these results allow us to perform a systematic calculation of the average lyapunov exponent and the topological entropy .",
    "consider the dynamics of a classical particle in the stadium billiard where the potential is zero inside and infinity outside .",
    "the trajectory of the particle is a straight path which is broken and reflected whenever the particle hits a boundary .",
    "it can be described by a map which gives the functional relation between the position and orientation of two successive bounces of the particle from the walls . a periodic orbit in the stadium billiard is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in general ,",
    "a periodic orbit of order @xmath1 can be described by a sequence of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 specifies the boundary segment that the particle hits and @xmath5 specifies the position on that particular segment .",
    "the symbol @xmath4 can take one of four values 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 as shown in fig . 1 . on a straight boundary @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the half length of the straight edge ) , while on a circular boundary @xmath8 represents an angle .",
    "note that @xmath9 is the only parameter that determines the shape of the stadium . in the analysis that follows we find it useful to continue the straight boundaries to infinity from both sides and to complete the circles ( thin lines in fig .",
    "1 ) .    we will first try to obtain the symbolic dynamics of the stadium billiard .",
    "let us examine the set of symbol sequences @xmath10 to see whether they provide a unique identification of the periodic orbits .",
    "we find that this symbolic representation is unique with one exception : in case of two or more successive bounces from one semicircle there is a degeneracy between the upward and downward trajectories ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , namely there may be two periodic orbits with the same symbol sequence . to remove this degeneracy we introduce the symbols @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 which replace the symbols 1 and 3 respectively , such that the arrows identify the direction of the motion ( note that for a single bounce from a semicircle there is no such degeneracy .",
    "therefore , in this case only one symbol is needed for each semicircle and we choose @xmath11 and @xmath13 for the semicircles on the left and right hand sides respectively ) .",
    "we now have six symbols : @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 , that provide a unique symbolic dynamics , namely that each periodic orbit corresponds to a unique symbol sequence . in order to perform a systematic study of all the periodic orbits of a given order @xmath1",
    "it is convenient to represent the symbol sequences as numbers in base 6 .",
    "we thus replace the symbols @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 by 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 respectively .",
    "we have obtained strong numerical evidence that this symbolic representation is unique , namely each symbol sequence can not represent more than one orbit @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some of these sequences do not represent periodic orbits of the stadium billiard and should thus be pruned .",
    "there are two types of pruning rules : ( a ) _ geometric _ pruning rules , that prune sequences that can not , in principle , represent any orbit no matter what the value of @xmath7 is ( the simplest example is a sequence that has two or more successive bounces from a straight edge ) ( see appendix a ) ; ( b ) _ dynamical _ pruning rules , that prune periodic orbits which can exist in principle but do not exist for a given value of the parameter @xmath7 , because they can not satisfy the reflection condition on the boundaries of the stadium .",
    "we will now describe the computational technique for the calculation of the periodic orbits .",
    "it is based on the idea that a periodic orbit of order @xmath1 can be obtained from a variational function of @xmath1 variables .",
    "we visualize the periodic orbits as a set of interacting atoms sitting on the boundaries of the stadium .",
    "one can write a variational function which is minimized when the reflection condition between the incoming and outgoing directions is satisfied at each point .",
    "the variational function is @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the angle between the incoming ( outgoing ) direction and the tangent at the reflection point .",
    "we will now introduce an artificial dynamics that converges to the minimum of this variational function and thus allows us to find the periodic orbits .",
    "we apply the following procedure : ( a ) choose a symbol sequence @xmath10 , @xmath20 that is not forbidden by the geometric pruning rules ; ( b ) choose an initial condition @xmath21 where each atom sits on the correct boundary section defined by the symbol sequence , but in an arbitrary position ; ( c ) introduce an artificial dynamics that converges to the desired periodic orbit identified by @xmath10 .",
    "the artificial dynamics takes the following form : @xmath22 where the right hand side represents the force applied on the nth atom and all these equations are iterated simultaneously .",
    "the prefactor is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant ( typically @xmath25 ) and the signs are chosen such that on a straight edge the atoms move to the direction of the smaller angle , while on a semicircle they move to the direction of the larger angle ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in both cases",
    "the smaller angle then increases and the larger angle decreases until they become equal , so the reflection condition is satisfied and the periodic orbit is obtained @xcite .",
    "note that this dynamics preserves the topological structure of the orbits , i.e. , the symbol sequence never changes .",
    "we find that for any symbol sequence which is not forbidden by the geometric pruning rules this artificial dynamics converges to a fixed point . in case that all the reflection points lie on boundary segments of the original stadium",
    "then the resulting configuration is a periodic orbit of the stadium billiard .",
    "however , for some choices of @xmath10 the resulting orbit has one or more atoms on boundary segments which do not belong to the original stadium ( thin lines in fig .",
    "these sequences do not represent periodic orbits of the stadium and are thus dynamically pruned .    in practice",
    "we solve eqs .",
    "( [ artdyn ] ) until all forces become smaller than a test value @xmath26 ( typically @xmath27 ) .",
    "the procedure converges for all initial conditions . since",
    "only the final configuration is of interest it is possible to choose a fourth order runge - kutta method with a relatively large step size ( @xmath28 ) to solve the equations .",
    "to examine the technique we have calculated all the periodic orbits up to order @xmath0 and selected orbits up to order 200 @xcite .",
    "an important test is the uniqueness of the symbolic dynamics .",
    "the symbolic dynamics is unique if : ( a ) each periodic orbit corresponds to one and only one symbol sequence ; and ( b ) each symbol sequence corresponds to at most one periodic orbit .",
    "the symbolic dynamics we introduce for the stadium guarantees property ( a ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the symbol sequence is determined by the sequence of boundary segments on which the atoms sit .",
    "this sequence is determined in the initial conditions and does not change during the iterations of the artificial dynamics ( note that in other systems such as the hnon map this property is not guaranteed as in principle the same periodic orbit can be obtained for two different symbol sequences ) . to examine property ( b ) we repeated the calculation of periodic orbits with different sets of initial conditions . in all cases we found for",
    "any choice @xmath10 the artificial dynamics ( 2 ) converges to a unique orbit independent of the initial conditions .",
    "therefore we have strong numerical evidence for the uniqueness of our symbolic dynamics .",
    "using our data up to @xmath0 we then calculated the topological entropy , which is the limit of @xmath29 as @xmath30 ( see table 1 ) . here",
    "@xmath31 is the total number of points which belong to periodic orbits of order p @xcite .",
    "note that time reversal orbits need to be included ( see fig .",
    "the topological entropy as a function of p is shown in fig .",
    "5 . to calculate the lyapunov number for a periodic orbit we use the monodromy matrix method",
    ". for each path",
    ", we define the the infinitesimal angular deviation @xmath32 , and the normal deviation @xmath33 which are canonically conjugate variables",
    ". then the lyapunov number of a periodic orbit of order p is obtained from the matrix @xmath34 , where @xmath35 takes the form    @xmath36    for a point on a straight edge , and    @xmath37    for a point on a semicircle . here",
    "@xmath38 is the path length from atom @xmath39 to atom @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the radius of the circle ( we use @xmath44 ) .",
    "the lyapunov number @xmath45 is then the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath46 and the corresponding lyapunov exponent is @xmath47 .",
    "the periodic orbits can then be used to calculate average properties of the chaotic dynamics .",
    "the motion of a particle in the stadium can be considered as a continuous motion , for which the pointwise lyapunov exponent is @xmath48 where l is the length of the orbit .",
    "it can also be considered as a discrete map of the form @xmath49 that relates the coordinates of consecutive bounces from the boundaries . in this case",
    "the pointwise lyapunov exponent is @xmath50 , where @xmath1 is the number of boundary hits .",
    "considering the motion as a discrete map we can use the periodic orbits to calculate the average discrete lyapunov exponent given by the limit as @xmath30 of @xcite : @xmath51 here the sum goes through all the fixed points of @xmath52 .",
    "these include all the points that belong to periodic orbits of order p and its divisors . the lyapunov exponents @xmath53 are the lyapunov exponents of the periodic orbits of order @xmath1 including repetitions of shorter orbits .",
    "the average continuous lyapunov exponent is calculated in similar fashion and is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the length of the orbit .",
    "the average discrete and continuous lyapunov exponents as a function of p are shown in fig .",
    "we find that the convergence as a function of @xmath1 is slow .",
    "there are oscillations between even and odd @xmath1 such that the average lyapunov exponents are larger for odd @xmath1 and smaller for even @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that better convergence can be obtained by using the average of @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 ) between pairs of consecutive even and odd values of @xmath1 .",
    "we then find that @xmath58 in agreement with previous results @xcite which are based on the iteration of an ensemble of long trajectories with random initial conditions .",
    "in summary , we have developed a numerical technique for the calculation of unstable periodic orbits in the stadium billiard which provides a complete classification of all periodic orbits and allows us to calculate any particular orbit to a very good accuracy . using this technique we found all the periodic orbits up to order 11 and used them to calculate quantities that characterize the dynamics such as the topological entropy and the average lyapunov exponent .",
    "we have also conducted preliminary studies with the gutzwiller trace formula that will be reported in a future publication .",
    "we are currently considering a generalization of the method to the case where magnetic field is present and the orbits consist of circular segments .",
    "we believe that similar concepts can be developed for other billiard geometries of interest and scattering problems .",
    "such techniques will be useful to study the dynamics of electrons in mesoscopic systems in the ballistic limit @xcite and to a variety of scattering problems @xcite .",
    "we thank s. fishman , c. jayaprakash and w. wenzel for helpful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge support from the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "dmr-8451911 , an ibm post - doctoral fellowship ( mk ) and the department of energy at the ohio state university where this work was initiated .",
    "this work was conducted using the computational resources of the ohio supercomputer center at the ohio state university and the northeast parallel architectures center ( npac ) at syracuse university .",
    "we thank the referees who reviewed a previous version of this paper for useful suggestions . while revising the paper we received a preprint from hansen @xcite using our symbolic dynamics to calculate pruning fronts .    in this appendix",
    "we present the geometrical pruning rules , namely the pruning rules that hold for all values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "these rules that result from the geometry of the stadium billiard were found by inspection and are easy to verify .",
    "the following symbol sequences are disallowed due to geometrical pruning rules :      \\(2 ) sequences that contain an isolated 4 or an isolated 5 . for the sake of uniqueness a single bounce from a circular boundary is represented by 1 or 3 , and therefore 4 and 5 appear at least in pairs ( ... 44 ... or ... 55 ... ) .",
    "\\(3 ) each periodic orbit ( except for the sequence @xmath62 that represents a continuous family of period two orbits that bounce between the straight boundaries ) should hit each one of the circular boundaries at least once . therefore , each sequence should include ( at least once ) the symbol 1 ( or 4 ) , and the symbol 3 ( or 5 ) , otherwise it should be pruned .",
    "\\(4 ) an orbit can not hit a circular boundary , then a straight boundary and then go back to the same circular boundary .",
    "therefore , symbol sequences that contain the following segments must be pruned : ... 101 ... , ... 104 ... , ... 401 ... , ... 404 ... , ... 121 ... , ... 124 ... , ... 421 ... , ... 424 ... , ( for the circular boundary on the left ) , and ...",
    "303 ... , ... 305 ... , ... 503 ... , ... 505 ... , ... 323 ... , ... 325 ... , ... 523 ... , ... 525 ... ( for the circular boundary on the right ) .",
    "\\(6 ) an orbit that hits a circular boundary and then follows by successive hits of the straight boundaries must then hit the second circular boundary before it can return to the first one ( this is a generalization of pruning rule no 4 ) .",
    "therefore , sequences such as ... 102021 ... , ... 1020204 ... , as well as ...",
    "3202023 ... , and ...",
    "50205 ... are geometrically pruned .",
    "we believe that the list presented above contains the complete set of geometrical pruning rules . any symbol sequence that falls into one or more of these six categories will not have a periodic orbit associated with it no matter what the parameter @xmath7 is .",
    "we have no proof that this list is complete .",
    "note that the main use of these rules is to save time by not trying to calculate orbits that do not exist .",
    "if this list is incomplete , then the extra orbits will be pruned anyway using the dynamical pruning rules , so in any case it does not affect any of our results .    ya .",
