    "the past decade has witnessed a great deal of activity devoted to complex networks by the scientific community , since many systems in the real world can be described and characterized by complex networks  @xcite .",
    "prompted by the computerization of data acquisition and the increased computing power of computers , researchers have done a lot of empirical studies on diverse real networked systems , unveiling the presence of some generic properties of various natural and manmade networks : power - law degree distribution @xmath0 with characteristic exponent @xmath1 in the range between 2 and 3  @xcite , small - world effect including large clustering coefficient and small average path length ( apl )  @xcite , and degree correlations  @xcite .",
    "these findings are important for our understanding of the real - life systems , since they strongly affect almost all aspects of various dynamical processes taking place on networks  @xcite .    in order to reproduce or explain the above - mentioned striking common features of real - life systems , there has been a concerted effort in the last few years within the physical circle and elsewhere to develop network models to uncover and understand the complexity of real systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the seminal watts - strogatz s ( ws ) small - world network model  @xcite and barabsi - albert s ( ba ) scale - free network model  @xcite , a huge variety of models and mechanisms have been proposed to mimic real - world systems , including initial attractiveness  @xcite , aging and cost  @xcite , fitness model  @xcite , duplication  @xcite , weight or traffic driven evolution  @xcite , accelerating growth  @xcite , coevolution  @xcite , visibility graph  @xcite , to name but a few . for reviews ,",
    "see refs .  @xcite .",
    "although significant progress has been made in the field of network modeling and has led to a significant improvement in our understanding of complex systems , it is still a fundamental task and of current interest to construct models mimicking real networks and reproducing their generic properties from different angles .",
    "most previous network models concentrated on topological aspects and ignored the geographical effects . in these work",
    ", the node position has no special signification , which is reasonable for some networks that can be considered as lying in an abstract space , such as scientific collaboration network  @xcite , metabolic network  @xcite and so forth .",
    "however , a plethora of real networks have well - defined node positions , including the internet  @xcite , power grid  @xcite , airline networks  @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "this class of networks is often referred to as geographical or spatial networks , which is a promising kind of networks , since its geography has a pivotal influence on the dynamics running on the networks , such as robustness  @xcite , cascading breakdown  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , disease spreading  @xcite , among others .",
    "in addition to the geography , some real - world geographical networks are also planar .",
    "typical examples are street networks  @xcite , electronic circuit networks  @xcite , ant - trail networks  @xcite , and neural networks  @xcite .",
    "recently several models  @xcite have been presented that take the the geographical position into consideration .",
    "however , models for spatial planar networks are much less , with the exception of space - filling networks  apollonian networks  @xcite that have received a great amount of attention  @xcite .    in the paper , inspired by the disk packing and the construction method of apollonian networks  @xcite , we propose a spatial planar network , where nodes ( located at the center of disks ) correspond to the disks and edges represent contact relation . the suggested network belongs to a deterministically growing class of self - similar graphs .",
    "on the basis of the recursive construction and self - similar structure of the network , we determine analytically many relevant topological properties , such as degree distribution , clustering coefficient , average path length , as well as degree correlations .",
    "the obtained results show that the network is simultaneously scale - free , small - world , and disassortative , as observed in a variety of real networks . except for the fact that all nodes of the network have separate spatial positions that encode the network structure ,",
    "we also show that the network is not only planar , but also maximally planar .",
    "note that although apollonian networks are also derived from a recursive disk packing , a main subject of the current paper is to compare the topological features of the presented network and apollonian networks , with an aim to address the effect of the way of disk packings ( thus the spatial constrains of nodes ) on the network structure , which is important to the theory of complex networks .",
    "the first two generations for the construction of the disk packing . ]",
    "before defining the network , we first introduce a disk packing  @xcite , which is a variation of the celebrated apollonian packing  @xcite .",
    "the introduced disk packing , shown in figure  [ packing ] , is constructed as follows .",
    "we start with three mutually touching disks , the interstice of which is a curvilinear triangle , and we denote this initial configuration by generation @xmath2 .",
    "then in the first generation @xmath3 , three smaller mutually touching disks are added to fill the interstice of the initial configuration , each of which touches two adjacent sides of the initial curvilinear triangle , giving rise to seven new smaller curvilinear triangles . for subsequent generations",
    "we indefinitely repeat the packing process for all the new curvilinear triangles . in the limit of infinite @xmath4 generations ,",
    "we obtain a disk packing .",
    "the above - mentioned disk packing can be used as a basis for a network , which is the research object of current paper .",
    "the translation from the disk packing to network generation is quite straightforward .",
    "let the nodes ( vertices ) of the network correspond to the disks and make two nodes connected if the corresponding disks are in contact .",
    "alternatively , one can also connect the centers of the touching disks by lines to obtain the network .",
    "figure  [ net ] shows the network corresponding to the disk packing in figure  [ packing ] .",
    "illustration of the network corresponding to the disk packing shown in figure  [ packing ] . ]    in the construction process of the disk packing , for each interstice at arbitrary generation , once we add three disks to fill it , seven new interstices are created that will be filled in the next iteration . when building the network , it is equivalent to say that for each group of three new nodes added , seven new triangles are generated in the network , into each of which a group of three nodes will be inserted in the next iteration . according to this",
    ", we can introduce an iterative algorithm to create the network , denoted by @xmath5 after @xmath4 generation evolutions .    the iterative algorithm for the network",
    "is as follows : for @xmath2 , @xmath6 consists of three nodes forming a triangle .",
    "then , we add three nodes into the original triangle .",
    "these three new nodes are linked to each other shaping a new triangle , and both ends of each edge of the new triangle are connected to a node of the original triangle .",
    "thus we get @xmath7 , see figure  [ iterative ] . for @xmath8 , @xmath5",
    "is obtained from @xmath9 . for each of the existing triangles of @xmath9 that has never generated nodes before , we call it an active triangle .",
    "we replace each of the existing active triangles of @xmath9 by the connected cluster on the right hand side of figure  [ iterative ] to obtain @xmath5 .",
    "the growing process is repeated until the network reaches a desired order ( node number of network ) .",
    "figure  [ net ] shows the network growing process for the first two steps .",
    "next we compute the order and size ( number of all edges ) of the network @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the number of nodes , edges and active triangles created at step @xmath4 , respectively . by construction",
    "( see also figure  [ iterative ] ) , each active triangle in @xmath9 will be replaced by seven active triangles in @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is not difficult to find the following relation : @xmath13 . since @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 .",
    "note that each active triangle in @xmath9 will lead to an addition of three new nodes and nine new edges at step @xmath4 , then one can easily obtain the following relations : @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for arbitrary @xmath18 . from these results , we can compute the order and size of the network . the total number of vertices @xmath19 and edges @xmath20 present at step @xmath4 is @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "so for large @xmath4 , the average degree @xmath23 is approximately @xmath24 , which shows the network is sparse as most real systems .    from equations .",
    "( [ nt ] ) and  ( [ et ] ) , we have @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , by the very construction of the network , it is obvious that arbitrary two edges in the network never cross each other .",
    "thus our network is a maximal planar network ( or graph )  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we study the statistical properties of the network , in terms of degree distribution , clustering coefficient , average path length , and degree correlations .",
    "when a new node @xmath26 is added to the graph at step @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , it has a degree of @xmath29 . let @xmath30 be the number of active triangles at step @xmath4 that will create new nodes connected to node @xmath26 at step @xmath31 . then at step @xmath27 , @xmath32 . from the iterative generation process of the network , one can see that at any step each two new neighbors of @xmath26 generate three new active triangles involving @xmath26 , and one of its existing active triangle is deactivated simultaneously .",
    "we define @xmath33 as the degree of node @xmath26 at time @xmath4 , then the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath30 satisfies : @xmath34 now we compute @xmath30 . by construction , @xmath35 . considering the initial condition @xmath32 , we can derive @xmath36 . then at time @xmath4 , the degree of vertex @xmath26 becomes @xmath37    it should be mentioned that the initial three vertices created at step 0 have a little different evolution process from other ones .",
    "we can easily obtain : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , at step @xmath4 , the degree of the initial three nodes is less than that of those three nodes born at step 1 but larger than that for those nodes emerging at other steps .",
    "equation  ( [ ki ] ) shows that the degree spectrum of the network is discrete .",
    "it follows that the cumulative degree distribution  @xcite is given by @xmath40 which is valid for all @xmath41 .    substituting for @xmath27 ( @xmath41 ) in this expression using @xmath42 gives @xmath43 when @xmath4 is large enough , one can obtain @xmath44 so the degree distribution follows a power law form with the exponent @xmath45 .",
    "the clustering coefficient  @xcite @xmath46 of node @xmath26 is defined as the ratio between the number of edges @xmath47 that actually exist among the @xmath48 neighbors of node @xmath26 and its maximum possible value , @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of @xmath51 over all nodes in the network .    for our network ,",
    "the analytical expression of clustering coefficient @xmath52 for a single node with degree @xmath53 can be derived exactly .",
    "when a node enters the system , both @xmath54 and @xmath47 are 4 . in the following iterations , each of its active triangles increases both @xmath55 and @xmath56 by 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 for all nodes at all steps .",
    "so one can see that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the degree of a node and its clustering . for a node of degree @xmath53",
    ", we have @xmath58}{k(k-1)}=\\frac{4}{k}-\\frac{1}{k-1}.\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath53 , @xmath52 is inversely proportional to degree @xmath53 .",
    "the same scaling of @xmath59 has also been observed in several real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "semilogarithmic plot of average clustering coefficient @xmath60 versus network order @xmath61 . ]",
    "using equation ( [ ck ] ) , we can obtain the clustering @xmath60 of the network at step @xmath4 : @xmath62,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all the nodes and @xmath63 is the degree of the nodes created at step @xmath64 , which is given by equation  ( [ ki ] ) . in the infinite network order limit",
    "( @xmath65 ) , equation  ( [ acc ] ) converges to a nonzero value @xmath66 , as shown in figure  [ clustering ] .",
    "therefore , the average clustering coefficient of the network is very high .",
    "we represent all the shortest path lengths of network @xmath67 as a matrix in which the entry @xmath68 is the distance between node @xmath26 and @xmath69 that is the length of a shortest path joining @xmath26 and @xmath69 .",
    "a measure of the typical separation between two nodes in @xmath67 is given by the average path length ( also called average distance ) @xmath70 defined as the mean of distances over all pairs of nodes : @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the sum of the distances between two nodes over all couples .",
    "note that in equation  ( [ total01 ] ) , for a pair of nodes @xmath26 and @xmath69 ( @xmath73 ) , we only count @xmath68 or @xmath74 , not both .     may be obtained by joining seven copies of @xmath5 denoted as @xmath75 @xmath76 , which are connected to one another at the six edge nodes , i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . ]",
    "we continue by exhibiting the procedure of determining the total distance and present the recurrence formula , which allows us to obtain @xmath83 of the @xmath31 generation from @xmath84 of the @xmath4 generation .",
    "the network @xmath67 under consideration has a self - similar structure that allows one to calculate @xmath84 analytically  @xcite . as shown in figure  [ copy ] , network @xmath85 may be constructed by joining at six edge nodes ( i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) seven copies of @xmath67 that are labeled as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "according to the second construction method , the total distance @xmath83 satisfies the recursion relation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the sum over all shortest path length whose endpoints are not in the same @xmath75 branch .",
    "the last term -9 on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ total02 ] ) compensates for the overcounting of certain paths : the shortest path @xmath92 between @xmath77 and @xmath80 , with length 1 , is included in both @xmath86 and @xmath87 ; similarly , the shortest paths @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 are all computed twice . to determine @xmath101 ,",
    "all that is left is to calculate @xmath91 .      in order to compute @xmath91",
    ", we classify the nodes in @xmath85 into two categories : the six edge nodes ( such as @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 in figure  [ copy ] ) are called connecting nodes , while the other nodes are named non - connecting nodes .",
    "thus @xmath91 , named the crossing distance , can be obtained by summing the following path length that are not included in the distance of node pairs in @xmath102 : length of the shortest paths between non - connecting nodes , length of the shortest paths between connecting and non - connecting nodes , and length of the shortest paths between connecting nodes ( i.e. , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath97 ) .",
    "denote @xmath105 as the sum of all shortest paths between non - connecting nodes , whose end - points are in @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "that is to say , @xmath105 rules out the paths with end - point at the connecting nodes belonging to @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "for example , each path contributed to @xmath108 does not end at node @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 . on the other hand ,",
    "let @xmath109 be the set of non - connecting nodes in @xmath85 , which belong to @xmath102 .",
    "then the total sum @xmath91 is given by @xmath110    by symmetry , equation  ( [ cross01 ] ) can be simplified as @xmath111 having @xmath91 in terms of the quantities of @xmath108 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , the next step is to explicitly determine these quantities .      to calculate the crossing distance @xmath108 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , we classify interior nodes in network @xmath85 into seven different parts according to their shortest path lengths to each of the three peripheral nodes ( i.e. @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",

    "after some algebraic manipulations , we can rewrite equation  ( [ knn1 ] ) in term of @xmath53 to obtain @xmath205    for @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) , we have @xmath208 + 2\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{8t\\times3^{t}}{3^{t+1}+3}+2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , for large @xmath4 and @xmath53 , @xmath197 is approximately a power law function of @xmath53 as @xmath209 with @xmath210 , which shows that the network is disassortative .",
    "note that @xmath197 of the internet exhibits a similar power - law scaling with exponent @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "in summary , motivated by the disk packing and apollonian networks , we have presented a model for spatial planar networks introducing the influence of geography encoded in the disk packing . according to the construction",
    ", we have studied analytically the main structural features of the network .",
    "we have shown that the network has a power law distribution with exponent @xmath45 , it has a large clustering coefficient 0.603 , its apl scales logarithmically with the number of network nodes , and it is disassortative with the average degree of the nearest neighbors for nodes having degree @xmath53 being roughly a power - law function of @xmath53 with exponent -0.229 .",
    "note that although both the network considered here and the apollonian network  @xcite are translated from disk packings , and both networks have qualitatively similar topologies , their structural characteristics are quantitatively different .",
    "for example , the exponent of degree distribution is @xmath212 for our network , while for apollonian network it is @xmath213 ; the average clustering coefficients for our network and apollonian network are 0.603 and 0.828 , respectively . in addition , the average path length  @xcite and the degree correlations  @xcite for both networks are also of quantitative difference .",
    "these disparities of the two networks show that the ways of disk packing lead to different spatial constrains of network nodes , which in turn have a significant impact on network properties and thus dynamics running on networks , such as cascading failing  @xcite , random walks  @xcite , and so on .",
    "thus , we can conclude that for spatial networks the positions , where nodes are geographically located , matter greatly and should be incorporated when modeling such networks .",
    "ignoring the geography will lead to miss some important attributes and properties of the systems .",
