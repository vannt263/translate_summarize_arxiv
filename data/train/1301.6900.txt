    "human social activity in the form of person - to - person interactions has been studied and analysed in many contexts , both for online  @xcite and off - line behaviour  @xcite . however ,",
    "sometimes social interactions give rise to relations not anymore between individuals but rather between entities like companies  @xcite , associations  @xcite or even countries  @xcite .",
    "often these relations are associated with economic exchanges  @xcite , sports rivalry  @xcite or even cooperation  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study one type of such relations expressed in the form of _ _ sister city partnerships__. the concept of sister cities refers to a partnership between two cities or towns with the aim of cultural and economical exchange .",
    "sometimes these partnerships are also generated as a platform to support democratic processes .",
    "most partnerships connect cities in different countries , however also intra - country city partnerships exist .",
    "we extracted the network of sister cites as reported on the english wikipedia , as far as we know the most extensive but certainly not complete collection of this kind of relationships .",
    "the resulting social network , an example of social self organisation , is analysed in its initial form and aggregated per country .",
    "although there exist studies that analyse networks of cities ( e.g. networks generated via aggregating individual phone call interactions  @xcite ) to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that institutional relations between cities are analysed .",
    "the dataset used in this study was constructed ( using an automated parser and a manual cleaning process ) from the listings of sister cities on the english wikipedia .",
    "we found 15  225 pairs of sister cities , which form an undirected _ city network _ of 11  618 nodes . using the ` google maps api ` we were able to geo - locate 11  483 of these cities .",
    "we furthermore construct an aggregated undirected and weighted _ country network _ , where two countries @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected if a city of country @xmath0 is twinned with a city of country @xmath1 .",
    "the number of these international connections is the edge weight .",
    "the country network consists of 207 countries and 2  933 links .",
    "some countries have self - connections ( i.e. city partnerships within the same country ) .",
    "germany has the largest number of such self links as a result of many sister city relations between the formerly separated east and west germany .    .",
    "network properties : number of nodes @xmath2 and edges @xmath3 , average clustering coefficient @xmath4 , % of nodes in the giant component gc , average path - length @xmath5 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to understand mixing preferences between cities , we follow the methodology of  @xcite and calculate an assortativity measure based on the z - score of a comparison between the original sister city network and 100 randomised equivalents . for degree - assortativity ,",
    "randomised networks are constructed by reshuffling the connections and preserving the degree ; in the other cases , the network structure is preserved while the values of node properties are reshuffled .",
    "table  [ tab : und_asso ] gives an overview of the results .",
    "we find that the city network is highly assortative indicating a clear preference for connections between cities with similar degree .",
    "we also analyse assortativity scores for other variables and find that cities from countries with similar gross domestic product ( gdp ) per capita , human development index or even similar indexes of political stability are more likely to twin . only for the nominal gdp neutral mixing is observed .",
    "we discuss now city and country rankings based on centrality measures . for the sister city network we show the top 20 cities ranked by degree ( table  [ tab : top_degree ] , left ) .",
    "saint petersburg , often referred to as the geographic and cultural border of the west and east , is the most connected and also most central sister city .",
    "there are also cities , such as buenos aires , beijing , rio de janeiro and madrid , which have large degrees but exhibit lower betweenness ranks .",
    "in particular , the spanish and the chinese capitals have significantly lower values of betweenness , which could be caused by the fact that other important cities in these countries ( e.g. barcelona or shanghai ) act as primary international connectors .    in table  [ tab : top_degree ] ( right ) we present rankings for the country network . in this case",
    "the usa lead the rankings in the two centrality measures we report .",
    "the top ranks are nearly exclusively occupied by group of eight ( g8 ) countries suggesting a relation between economic power and sister city connections .",
    "in figure  [ fig : country_network_global ] we depict the country network .",
    "node size corresponds to the weighted degree , and the width of a connection to the number of city partnerships between the connected countries .",
    "the figure shows the central position of countries like the usa , france , uk and china in this network .",
    "the colours of the nodes correspond to the outcome of node clustering with the louvain method .",
    "we find 4 clusters .",
    "the largest one ( in violet ) includes the usa , spain and most south american , asian , and african countries .",
    "the second largest ( in green ) is composed of eastern - european and balkan countries : turkey , russia , and poland are the most linked among them .",
    "the third cluster ( in red ) consists of central and western - european countries and some of their former colonies .",
    "it is dominated by germany , uk , france and the netherlands .",
    "finally , the smallest cluster ( in cyan ) mainly consists of nordic countries .",
    "the clustering suggests cultural or geographical proximity being a factor in city partnerships . in the next section",
    "we will investigate this further .",
    "to test the extent to which geographical proximity is a important factor for city partnership we analyse the distribution of geographical distances between all pairs of sister cities .",
    "figure  [ fig : city_distances_distribution ] depicts this distribution as a histogram ( blue bars in the left sub - figures ) or as a cumulative distribution ( blue line in the right sub - figure ) .",
    "the figure also shows the overall distance distribution between all geo - located sister cities ( green bars and red line ) .",
    "we observe that there is nearly no difference ( apart from some random fluctuations ) between these two distributions .",
    "the fluctuations get cancelled out in the cumulative distributions where the two curves are nearly overlapping . only for very short distances",
    "the likelihood of city partnership with close sites is a bit larger than random .",
    "this can also be observed in the very small difference between the average distance of two randomly chosen sister cities ( @xmath6  km ) and two connected sister cities ( @xmath7  km ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : city_network_global ] visualises the distances between sister cities overlaid over a world map .",
    "we have analysed the practice of establishing sister city connections from a network analysis point of view . although there is no guarantee that our study covers all existing sister city relations , we are confident that the results obtained give reliable insights into the emerging network structures and country preferences    we have found that sister city relationships reflect certain predilections in and between different cultural clusters , and lead to degree - assortative network structures comparable to other types of small - world social networks .",
    "we also observe assortative mixing with respect to economic or political country indexes",
    ".    the most noteworthy result may be that the geographical distance has only a negligible influence when a city selects a sister city .",
    "this is different from what is observed for person - to - person social relationships ( see for example  @xcite ) where the probability of a social connection decays with the geographical distance between the peers .",
    "it may , thus , represent the first evidence in real - world social relationships ( albeit in its institutional form ) for the death of distance , predicted originally as a consequence of decrease of the price of human communication  @xcite .",
