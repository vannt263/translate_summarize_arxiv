    "many interesting classical games have been converted into quantum domain such as quantum prisoners dilemma [ 8 - 10 ] , the battle of the sexes [ 7 , 12 ] , the monty hall problem [ 13 , 14 ] , the rock - scissors - paper [ 15 ] and many others [ 16 - 19 ] . james et al . [",
    "20 ] have analyzed the quantum penny flip game using geometric algebra .",
    "recently , almeida et al .",
    "[ 21 ] have suggested that quantum correlations provide no advantage over classical correlations in a multipartite nonlocal game .",
    "noise effects in different quantum games have been investigated by many authors [ 5 , 7 , 10 , 18 , 22 ] with interesting results . in ref.[18 ,",
    "22 ] the authors have studied noise effects in quantum magic squares game . it is shown that the probability of success can be used to determine the characteristics of quantum channels .",
    "implementation of decoherence and quantum memory has also been extended to the novel field of quantum information theory [ 23 , 24 ] .",
    "the minority game has received much attention as a model of a population of agents repeatedly buying and selling in a market [ 25 , 26 ] .",
    "first quantum version of a four player quantum minority game ( qmg ) was examined by benjamin and hayden [ 27 ] , and later generalized to @xmath1-players [ 28 ] .",
    "flitney et al . have extended its consideration towards the implementation of decoherence [ 29 ] .",
    "quantum channels with memory [ 30 - 32 ] provides a natural theoretical framework for the study of any noisy quantum communication system where correlation time is longer than the time between consecutive uses of the channel .",
    "a more general model of a quantum channel with memory was introduced by bowen and mancini [ 33 ] and also studied by kretschmann and werner [ 34 ] .    here , in this work , we study the four - player quantum minority game influenced by different memory channels , such as amplitude damping , depolarizing , bit - flip , phase - flip and bit - phase - flip channels , parameterized by the decoherence parameter @xmath2  and memory parameter @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] represent the lower and upper limits of decoherence parameter and memory parameter respectively .",
    "it is seen that the players payoffs heavily depends on the memory of the channel .",
    "a similar behaviour of depolarizing and bit - phase flip channels is seen for maximum correlations .",
    "it is also seen that amplitude damping channel influences the game more heavily as compared to the other channels .",
    "the nash equilibrium payoff is substantially enhanced due to the presence of quantum memory .",
    "hence , memory controls the payoff reduction due to decoherence .",
    "since noise is a major hurdle in the path of efficient information transmission from one party to the other .",
    "this noise causes a distortion of the information sent through the channel .",
    "information transmission is said to be reliable if the probability of error , in decoding the output of the channel , vanishes asymptotically in the number of uses of the channel .",
    "a basic question of information theory is whether there is any advantage in using entangled states as input states . that is , whether or not encoding the classical data into entangled rather than separable states increases the mutual information . for the case",
    "when multiple uses of the channel are not correlated , there is no advantage in using entangled states .",
    "correlated noise , also referred as memory in the literature , acts on consecutive uses of the channels . however , in general , one may want to encode classical data into entangled strings or consecutive uses of the channel may be correlated to each other .",
    "hence , we are dealing with a strongly correlated quantum system , the correlation of which results from the memory of the channel itself .",
    "the initial game state consists of one qubit for each player , prepared in an entangled ghz state by an entangling operator @xmath6 acting on @xmath7 .",
    "pure quantum strategies are local unitary operators acting on a player s qubit . after all players have executed their moves the game state undergoes a positive operator valued measurement and the payoffs are determined from the classical payoff matrix . in the eisert protocol this is achieved by applying  @xmath8  to the game state and then making a measurement in the computational basis state . here",
    "we describe the four - player minority game in the presence of quantum memory using the eisert scheme in the following manner@xmath9to produce the final state @xmath10 upon which a measurement is taken . here",
    "@xmath11  represents the kth player move .",
    "it is important to mention here that for the sake of simplicity , we have considered @xmath12 and @xmath13 in our calculations .",
    "the function @xmath14 represents a completely positive map which can be completely described in kraus operator formalism as studied by macchiavello and palma [ 30 ] a pauli channel with partial memory .",
    "the two qubit kraus operators for such a channel are given by@xmath15}\\sigma _",

    "in order to remove correlations , one can wait until the channel has relaxed to its original state before sending the next qubit , however this lowers the rate of information transfer .",
    "thus it is necessary to consider the performance of the channel for arbitrary values of @xmath3 to reach a compromise between various factors which determine the final rate of information transfer .",
    "thus in passing through the channel any two consecutive qubits undergo random independent ( uncorrelated ) errors with probability ( @xmath26 and identical ( correlated ) errors with probability @xmath3",
    ". this should be the case if the channel has a memory depending on its relaxation time and if we stream the qubits through it .",
