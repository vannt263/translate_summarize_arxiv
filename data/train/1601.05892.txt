    "the @xmath1 monopole transition has been regarded as a physical quantity which is related to the matter properties of heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition , recently it has been discussed that it is closely related to the structures of light nuclei , especially for their cluster structure @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 monopole excitation induces the breathing mode of nuclei . however changing nuclear density requires highly excitation energy because of the saturation property of nuclear systems . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is composed of strongly bound subsystems called clusters , the relative interaction between cluster is weak , and it is possible to change the relative distances ( nuclear sizes ) without giving high excitation energies .",
    "@xmath2 clusters are very stable and they are good candidates .",
    "the monopole excitation is expected to induce @xmath2 cluster excitation ( excitation from the ground state to states with @xmath2 cluster structure ) in low excitation energy region .",
    "indeed , strong monopole transition and the relation to @xmath2 clustering have been discussed in @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 _ etc _ @xcite .",
    "now we focus on the case that the counterpart of the @xmath2 cluster has more complex structure .",
    "there have been numerous works showing that the low - lying states of @xmath0 , including the @xmath4 state , have @xmath5 structure @xcite .",
    "also in this nucleus , the @xmath1 strength distribution has been observed @xcite .",
    "if we compare the results with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculation based on the mean - field theory @xcite , the agreement in high excitation energy region is good ; however it is not in low excitation energy region .",
    "there some of the strong peaks observed are missing in the calculation .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 transitions from the @xmath12 to the @xmath4 and @xmath13 states are observed to be @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite , and they correspond to about 3% and 8% of the energy weighted sum rule @xcite .",
    "based on the cluster approaches , these @xmath1 transitions to low - lying states are theoretically explained in the frameworks of @xmath5 orthogonality condition model ( ocm ) @xcite , @xmath16 ocm @xcite and @xmath17 ( antisymmetrized molecular dynamics : amd ) @xmath18 generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite .",
    "et al_. pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that there are two reasons for the @xmath1 transition from the ground state to low - lying cluster states .",
    "one is the duality ; simple shell model wave function automatically contains the clustering degree of freedom",
    ". if we take the zero limit for the relative distance between @xmath17 and @xmath2 , the wave function agrees with the closed @xmath3 shell configuration of the shell model .",
    "thus there is certain path from the ground state to the @xmath5 cluster configuration .",
    "this is explained by the so - called bayman - bohr theorem @xcite .",
    "the other is ground state correlation .",
    "the ground state slightly deviates from the shell model limit and contains more @xmath5 cluster configurations when the wave functions corresponding to this path are superposed .",
    "this effect enhances the transition from the ground state to the @xmath5 cluster states .",
    "however , the discussion of bayman - bohr theorem is based on the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator type wave function ( or @xmath19 cluster model wave function with some limit of relative distances ) and it is not trivial whether the same logic holds or not when the @xmath20-coupling shell model wave functions are introduced .",
    "the ground state is rather safe ; the closed @xmath3 shell configuration , which plays a dominant role in the ground state , can be equally described by the four @xmath2 cluster model and @xmath20-coupling shell model . on the contrary",
    ", there appears non - negligible difference in the wave function of @xmath5 states when the @xmath20-coupling @xmath7c is introduced . in our previous analysis for @xmath17",
    ", we discussed that the ground state of @xmath17 is an intermediate state between three @xmath2 cluster state and the subclosure configuration of @xmath6 in the @xmath20-coupling shell model , and there the contribution of the spin - orbit force is quite strong @xcite . in @xmath21o , both wave functions of the ground and excited states contributes to the monopole transition matrix elements , and it is worthwhile to investigate whether the inclusion of shell model like wave functions for the @xmath7c cluster part changes the story of monopole transition strengths in the low energy regions or not .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the behavior of the @xmath1 transition matrix elements from the ground state when the @xmath20-coupling shell model @xmath7c is mixed with three @xmath2 in the excited states of @xmath0 .",
    "we take notice on the @xmath1 transition matrix elements as a function of the strength of the spin - orbit force in the hamiltonian . with increasing the spin - orbit strength ,",
    "the @xmath2 breaking components become more important , and @xmath20-coupling shell model @xmath7c strongly mixes in the @xmath7c+@xmath2 cluster states .",
    "although the @xmath1 operator itself does not have the spin dependence , the @xmath1 transition matrix elements turns out to be sensitive to this change .    as a theoretical framework ,",
    "we use antisymmetrized quasi cluster model ( aqcm ) @xcite .",
    "aqcm is the method , which can describe @xmath20-coupling shell model wave function by extending cluster model .",
    "the remarkable advantage of aqcm is that the number of the parameters required to characterize the transition from cluster state to @xmath20-coupling shell state is quite small .",
    "in addition to the distance parameters used in traditional cluster models , aqcm needs only one new parameter @xmath22 , which describes the dissolution of @xmath2 clusters and change into @xmath20-coupling shell state ; the clusters with finite @xmath22 value are called `` quasi clusters '' . in @xmath17 ,",
    "et al_. were successful to describe the change of three @xmath2 cluster state into the @xmath6 subclosure configuration of the @xmath20-coupling shell model with only two parameters , namely distance parameter @xmath23 and dissolution parameter @xmath22 @xcite . in this work",

    "all the @xmath72 states listed here have the value close to zero . with increasing @xmath71 , the basis states with",
    "finite @xmath22 start contributing to each state , and the intrinsic spin increases in all the states listed here .",
    "however the increase is much smaller in the ground state due to the closed shell structure of the @xmath3 shell ; the state has the value of 0.3 at @xmath125 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the value for the second @xmath72 state is 1.8 , where the subclosure configuration of the @xmath6 shell for the @xmath7c cluster part is important .",
    "the intrinsic spin structure of these two states are completely different .",
    "this is the reason for the suppression of the @xmath1 transition probability between these states .",
    "although the @xmath1 operator itself does not have the spin dependence , the matrix element is sensitive to the difference of intrinsic spin structures of the two states .      in our model",
    ", we considered only triangular pyramid structures , _",
    "i.e. _ we did not consider the effect of rotation of three @xmath2 clusters forming @xmath17 with respect to the last @xmath2 cluster .",
    "the definition of the coordinate system in this work may lead to the overestimation of the @xmath1 transition strength .",
    "taking into account other orientations of @xmath17 as in the previous study @xcite is expected to help in better reproduction of the experimental value .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig.monopolels ] , the @xmath1 transition matrix elements from the first to the second @xmath72 states is around 8.3 @xmath93  @xmath94 at @xmath71 = 0 mev .",
    "this value is reduced when other orientations of @xmath7c are introduced .",
    "if we prepare @xmath126 ( four @xmath2 ) wave functions with other orientations of @xmath7c with respect to the forth @xmath2 and diagonalize the hamiltonian , the value decreases to 6.9 @xmath93  @xmath94 . in our analyses we needed rather large value of @xmath127",
    "2500 mev to reproduce the experimental @xmath1 value from the ground to the second @xmath72 state ; however this result indicates that we could reproduce it with a bit smaller @xmath71 value when this orientation effect is taken into account .",
    "in this study , for @xmath0 , the @xmath72 energy levels and the @xmath1 transition matrix elements from the ground state have been investigated in the framework of aqcm .",
    "the @xmath1 transition strength has been known as a quantity which characterizes the cluster structure of low - lying excited states , and here we focused on the dependence on the strength of the spin - orbit force , @xmath71 .",
    "the ground state is compact four @xmath2 state and almost independent of @xmath71 . on the contrary ,",
    "as pointed out by many previous works , cluster structure is important in the @xmath4 state , and this is obtained also in our model .",
    "in addition , in the present study we discussed the change of the wave function of the @xmath17 cluster part . with increasing @xmath71 ,",
    "the level repulsion occurs and the @xmath17 cluster part change from three @xmath2 s , which are not affected by the spin - orbit force , to the @xmath6 subclosure of the @xmath20-coupling shell model , and the excitation energy of the @xmath8 state drastically decreases .",
    "the @xmath1 transition matrix elements from the ground state to the excited states are strongly dependent on the level repulsions . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the @xmath1 transition matrix element from the ground state to the second @xmath72 state is around 8 @xmath93  @xmath94 , which is much larger than the observed one ( @xmath128 ) . in the region of @xmath96",
    ", it starts decreasing and becomes comparable to the experimental one slightly above @xmath129 . on the other hand , the value from the ground state to the third @xmath72 state is around 2 @xmath93  @xmath94 at @xmath124 mev and this is too small compared with the experimental value of @xmath98 .",
    "the value increases and becomes comparable to the experimental one around @xmath81 mev .",
    "the decrease of the transition matrix element to the second @xmath72 and the increase to the third @xmath72 state is due to the level repulsion between the second and third states .",
    "the wave functions of these states are interchanged .",
    "experimentally the transition matrix element to the third @xmath72 state is slightly larger than one for the second @xmath72 state , and this is realized with the @xmath71 value slightly above 2000 mev . in this model ,",
    "only triangular pyramid structure of @xmath21o has been considered ; however taking into account other orientations of @xmath17 part with respect to @xmath2 is expected to help in further reproduction of the experimental transition matrix elements .",
    "the expectation value of the square of the intrinsic spin was also analyzed . at @xmath124 mev ,",
    "the ground and second @xmath72 states have the value close to zero . with increasing @xmath71 , the basis states with finite @xmath22 start contributing to each state , and the intrinsic spin increases ; however the increase is much smaller in the ground state due to the closed shell structure of the @xmath3 shell ( the value is 0.3 at @xmath125 mev ) . on the other hand , at @xmath125 mev ,",
    "the value for the second @xmath72 state is 1.8 , where the subclosure configuration of the @xmath6 shell for the @xmath7c cluster part is important .",
    "the intrinsic spin structure of these two states are completely different .",
    "this is the reason for the suppression of the @xmath1 transition probability between these states .",
    "although the @xmath1 operator itself does not have the spin dependence , the matrix element is sensitive to the difference of intrinsic spin structures of the two states .    in the traditional microscopic @xmath2 cluster models ,",
    "there has been a long standing problem that the calculated excitation energy of @xmath8 is higher than the experiments by more than @xmath83 , since the spin - orbit force is missing .",
    "now this is considerably improved by introducing the dissolution of @xmath2 clusters . however , taking into account other effect , such as three - body force effect @xcite , would be promising in order to fully solve the problem .    in this study",
    "we found an important correlation between the strength of the spin - orbit force and @xmath1 transition to low - lying excited states .",
    "the @xmath1 transition is sensitive to the persistence of @xmath19 correlation in the excited states and can be its measure .",
    "similar investigations for other light nuclei are on going .",
