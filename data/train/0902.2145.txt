    "the cdf collaboration has recently published a study of a significant sample of multi - muon events with unexpected properties @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration performed a similar search without finding similar events  @xcite . while it is still possible that these events will be in the end accounted for in terms of standard physics and detector effects , yet a small but significant fraction of them has characteristics which are peculiar enough to deserve attention .",
    "this has in fact prompted a phenomenological conjecture @xcite that tries to explain them in terms of new physics : the pair production of a relatively light standard model singlet , @xmath0 , each with a cascade decay into a final state made of 8 tau leptons .",
    "an intriguing feature of this _ explanation _ is that it describes well the sign - coded multiplicity distribution of the additional muons , from two on , found in a cone gev and @xmath5 .",
    "additional muons with @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 , which are often present in these events , are grouped into two _ cones _ of opening angle 36.8@xmath8 around the directions of the trigger ( also called _ primary _ ) muons .",
    "muons which happen to lie outside of these cones are ignored . ] around the direction of a primary muon . in this interpretation , such a distribution",
    "is simply related , given the detector efficiencies in muon identification , to the @xmath9 decay probability . on the other hand , the apparent difficulty in exhibiting a plausible production mechanism of the @xmath0-pair casts doubts on the significance of the proposal and , even more importantly , prevents a decisive comparison of the model with the data . in spite of its uncertainties and ambiguities ,",
    "this situation motivates us to try to go further .",
    "a main problem one faces right at the beginning is how to select , from the overwhelming number of background events , those ones that may represent the signal .",
    "secondly , a proper understanding of the event properties that involve hadronic tracks requires a detection simulation that we can not do . to get around these problems",
    "we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we first concentrate our attention on a sub - class of about 4000 events that contain at least two muons ( i.e.  one primary and at least one additional ) in each of the two cones .",
    "these events have also been highlighted in @xcite and found to have several properties especially difficult to understand in terms of known physics .",
    "we assume that these events constitute _ the signal _ and we seek for a production mechanism of the @xmath0-pair that can account for the measured properties of the muons contained in them . out of all possibilities ,",
    "discussed in section 2 , somewhat surprisingly one single effective operator of dimension 5 fits the invariant mass distribution of all muons in this sample for a definite value of its scale .",
    "the operator is of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a first generation quark",
    ".    encouraged by this result , which fixes the production mechanism , we analyze in section 3 a few other measured features of the multi - muon events : the @xmath12 multiplicity , impact parameter and invariant mass of muons in one cone . given our definition of the signal , the background can be clearly identified .",
    "we show that it should be possible , with the data at hand , to fit the tail of the muon impact parameter distribution by adopting the chain decay model proposed in @xcite , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are two other sm singlets and @xmath15 decays into a tau pair with a lifetime around 30 picoseconds .",
    "our main purpose is to make possible a close comparison of the model with the data so as to allow a decisive test . to this end",
    "we discuss in section 4 a few quantitative predictions of the model that should be compared with the data .",
    "the @xmath0-pair production cross section needed to explain _ the signal _ is about 200 pb , in turn requiring a scale of the effective operator that describes it of about 100 gev . to make it acceptable",
    ", we find it necessary to _ deconstruct _ the effective operator in terms of renormalizable interactions , with new particles mediating the communication between the quarks in the proton and the _ hidden _ sector that contains @xmath0 .",
    "these new particles and interactions must not lead to any unseen structure in the multi - muon data and must be consistent with known experimental constraints . given the size of the cross section and the low effective scale involved , this proves nontrivial to achieve .",
    "nevertheless we illustrate in section 5 two minimal models that can pass the test , to the best that we can tell .",
    "one involves a scalar exchange in the @xmath16-channel and another a fermion exchanged in the @xmath17-channel . in both cases the couplings to the singlet @xmath0 saturate perturbation theory .",
    "we also briefly comment on the problems that one may face in turning them into complete satisfactory extensions of the sm .",
    "if this interpretation of the cdf events will resist a further scrutiny along the lines we are proposing , the existence of the light scalar sector suggests a connection with recent astro - particle data . in section 6 we consider a hidden - sector dark matter model where dm annihilations into @xmath0 s that decay into @xmath18 s can provide the positron excess claimed in @xmath19 cosmic rays by pamela  @xcite , while giving in the @xmath20 spectrum a feature somewhat smoother than the peak claimed by atic  @xcite .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "as mentioned , we first concentrate our attention on the events with two cones containing at least two muons each , which we call _ signal _ events as their features are peculiar enough that they should be minimally polluted by known backgrounds and could therefore be a quasi - pure sample of a beyond the sm signal .",
    "for an integrated luminosity of 2.1 @xmath21 there are about four thousand such events  @xcite .",
    "if they have to arise from @xmath22 , this requires a significant @xmath23 cross section , above 100 pb .",
    "furthermore the invariant mass distribution of all muons contained in these events , fig .",
    "35a of @xcite , which we aim to explain , does not show any special feature other than a threshold rise and an extended tail . in view of this",
    "we are led to consider an effective operator bilinear in @xmath0 and with two gluons or a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "there are three such operators of dimension less or equal to 6 is a complex field . ] : @xmath24 where @xmath11 is a quark field , either @xmath25 or @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the gluon field .",
    "we will normalize our plots below assuming that @xmath28 couples only to @xmath25 , while @xmath29 couples to both @xmath25 and @xmath26 with equal strength .    with the amplitude corresponding to each of these operators",

    "furthermore , the invariant mass of the trigger muon pair must be between 5 and 80 gev ; the relative azimuthal angle for the opposite sign trigger muon pair must be below @xmath35 radians .",

    "[ fig - o ] shows how well each of these three production models can account for the experimental distribution of the invariant mass of all muons contained in the two signal cones , shown in fig .",
    "35a of @xcite .",
    "the hardness of the observed distribution motivated us to consider production via effective non - renormalizable operators .",
    "the single relevant parameter here is the effective scale attached to each individual operator .",
    "we find it remarkable that a single operator , @xmath28 , can fit the full distribution . for definiteness",
    "we take @xmath39 only , which requires @xmath40gev ( fixed in this case to reproduce the total number of events ) . on the other hand @xmath29 and @xmath41",
    "can separately reproduce only the tail and the low - mass region close to threshold , respectively .",
    "the dashed red line in fig .",
    "[ fig - o]a shows the spectrum shape which results if @xmath42 are decay products of a narrow 300 gev scalar resonance : @xmath43 ( in arbitrary normalization ) .",
    "the purpose of including this spectrum , clearly unable to reproduce the experimental data , is twofold .",
    "first , this case was considered in @xcite , and our simulations agree .",
    "second , since the @xmath44 gev @xmath45-exchange gives a spectrum peaked around @xmath46 gev , we can deduce that muons carry on average around @xmath47 of the total @xmath42 invariant mass .",
    "in particular , events at the tail of the experimental spectrum , @xmath48 gev , should correspond to @xmath49 tev@xmath50",
    "concentrating on the @xmath0-production described by @xmath28 with @xmath51 fixed at 85 gev , we here try to reproduce a few other significant properties of the muons in the cdf events of  @xcite : 1 ) the already mentioned sign - coded multiplicity distribution ; 2 ) the invariant mass of the muons in a single cone ; 3 ) the muon impact parameter distribution .",
    "notice that data of  @xcite about 1 ) and 3 ) also contain events outside the sub - sample discussed in section [ production ] that we view as signal events ; thereby we allow for the presence of a background .      for reasons of graphical illustration ,",
    "the sign - coded muon multiplicity @xmath52 is defined for each of the two @xmath53 cones around the trigger muons by the formula@xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 is the number of additional muons in the cone having opposite ( same ) sign as the trigger muon .",
    "thus e.g. @xmath57 corresponds to cones without additional muons . in table 1 and",
    "[ fig - mult ] we compare the data with our simulation .",
    "the shape of this distribution is largely independent of the production mechanism , and indeed our fig .",
    "[ fig - mult ] is quite similar to fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "since we have fixed the production mechanism ( the @xmath59 operator ) , we can simulate not only the shape but also the absolute normalization ( @xmath60 ) , while in fig .",
    "1 of @xcite normalization has been fixed arbitrarily .",
    "we see in particular that we can reproduce essentially all events ( within errors ) with 3 or more muons in a cone : only a relatively small systematic excess of not understood backgrounds is here possibly needed to fully account for the event rates .",
    "however , only about a third of events with 2 muons in a cone is reproduced . since we fixed the normalization by using the events with two or more muons in",
    "_ both _ cones , this shows that events with only 2 muons in one cone and 1 muon in the other are still significantly contaminated by backgrounds .",
    "the fraction of events without additional muons that we are able to reproduce is negligible .",
    "almost all of these events must be background . indeed according to @xcite",
    "at least 50% of events without additional muons can be due to in - flight decays of kaons and hyperons producing real muons or pion punchthroughs .",
    "notice that the above agreement of simulation with experiment , in bins with @xmath61 muons , relies on the precise value of @xmath62 , thereby indirectly supporting the @xmath18 interpretation .",

    "the number of events with 3 muons in a cone ( including sign - coding ) , relative to the events with at least two muons in both cones , is largely independent of @xmath63 .",

    "indeed we see some excess of events around this value of @xmath80 ( which could become statistically significant with more statistics ) , but , at the same time , we do not forget an important source of dimuon pairs  @xmath85 mesons  present in the @xmath86 gev mass region . from the model - building point of view",

    "such a tail can be explained if the tracks originate from decays of a long - lived particle .",

    "[ fig - impact ] we compare one of the several published impact parameter distributions ( impact parameters of primary muons of all cones containing exactly 2 muons ) with our simulation .",
    "we assume that @xmath92 decays are prompt , while @xmath93 has a long lifetime . as discussed in @xcite , this assumption",
    "is forced on us by another piece of experimental data which we do not discuss here : no significant correlation between the impact parameters of different muonic tracks in the same cone .",

    "note that ` naive ' decay exponent would give a 20 ps lifetime ; the fact that the naive ultra - relativistic estimate underestimates the true lifetime by 30% in this particular case has already been noticed in @xcite on the basis of a toy simulations .",
    "we also see that the large number of events at small @xmath26 are not reproduced by our signal model .",
    "most of these events must be due to qcd contributions , e.g.  sequential @xmath94 quark decays which had been subtracted in the distributions considered previously but not in fig .",

    "all data are extracted from  @xcite , so that we follow their definitions .",
    "now that a concrete proposal for the @xmath0-production via the @xmath28 operator has emerged , what other possible tests could provide further checks of the model ?",
    "many such tests can be done using information about hadrons present in the multi - muon events .",
    "however , any study with hadrons would require detector simulation , especially because the relevant experimental information @xcite involves hadronic _ tracks _ rather than , say , isolated jets .",
    "in this section we discuss 3 further experimental tests which involve only muons and which might be relatively easier to implement .",
    "the corresponding experimental distributions are not yet available .",
    "these tests are : 1 ) dimuon displaced vertices ; 2 ) muon track alignment ; 3 ) deviation from back - to - backness in the cm  frame of the hard process .",

    "all our predictions below are computed using our simplified simulation of the triggering and reconstruction process , see footnote 1 . in order to perform a precise comparison with the data",
    ", the predictions should be recomputed using the full simulation of the detector , available only to the experimental collaborations .",
    "if the model is right , a fraction of events must contain a displaced secondary vertex with two muon tracks originating from it .",
    "such a vertex occurs when both taus in @xmath93 decay into a muon . according to our simulation , for @xmath95",
    "fb@xmath96 there will be about 2000 such secondary vertices , for @xmath15 lifetime of 30 ps almost all of them within the cdf inner silicon vertex detector ( @xmath97 cm radius ) .",
    "taking into account excellent tracking capabilities of the cdf detector , a significant fraction of these vertices should be identifiable .",
    "a useful experimental quantity to describe the secondary vertex distribution is called @xmath98 , the distance between the secondary and primary event vertices projected onto the transverse momentum of the two - track system . in fig .",
    "[ fig - lxy ] we give our simulated distribution for @xmath98 when the secondary vertex is determined by two muon tracks .",
    "as discussed in section [ other ] , @xmath99 can not be much above @xmath100 gev .",
    "on the other hand we must have @xmath101 otherwise the decay of @xmath15 will proceed via off - shell taus with a typical lifetime much bigger than the needed 30 ps .",
    "one consequence of such restricted kinematics is that the four @xmath15 are non - relativistic in the rest frame of the parent @xmath102 with typical kinetic energy@xmath103 as noticed in @xcite , this leads to @xmath15 decay vertices collinearly aligned along the @xmath0 momentum .",
    "indeed , their typical separation @xmath104 in the orthogonal direction is @xmath105    since we are here concerned only with muon tracks , the @xmath15 decay vertices can not be reconstructed in most cases .",
    "however , a nontrivial experimental measure of their collinear alignment can be defined purely in terms of muonic tracks , for events with at least 3 muons in a cone",

    "the distribution of @xmath0 s in rapidity does not contain much information , being mostly shaped by the experimental cuts and by the parton distributions .",
    "more interesting is the distribution of the relative azimuthal angle @xmath117 ( i.e.  the relative angle between @xmath116 and @xmath118 in the plane transverse to the beam ) , since the deviation from the back - to - back configuration ( @xmath119 ) can be due only to qcd radiation in our model . in our model",

    "once these issues are settled , such distribution can discriminate from other production mechanisms or possible backgrounds .",

    ", @xmath160tev requires therefore @xmath161 , i.e. a collection of pretty strong couplings .    the lagrangian ( [ lf ] ) generates also several 4-quark interactions at one loop , potentially relevant for the dijet physics .",
    "the typical scale of these operators will be @xmath162tev@xmath163 which , as previously discussed , should be compatible with current limits .",
    "the formulation of a full proper extension of the sm that incorporates in a consistent way both the hidden and the mediation sectors , in one of the two versions above , would obviously be premature at this stage and , as such , is outside the scope of this work .",
    "here we briefly mention some of the problem one would have to face .",
    "they are of at least three kinds :    1 .",
    "flavor problems ; 2 .",
    "naturalness problems associated with the lightness of @xmath0 ( and the other hidden particles ) ; 3 .   in the scalar - exchange case , a naturalness problem associated with the need of a vanishingly small vacuum expectation value of @xmath129 .",
    "the flavor problems are associated with the presence of the effective 4-quark interactions already discussed in connection with possible dijet signals . even in the 2/3-charge sector the limits on the effective scale of these interactions , if not properly aligned in flavor space , are severe .",
    "one at least technically acceptable way out may consist in assuming that all the yukawa interactions in @xmath164 , eq .",
    "( [ lh ] ) , or @xmath165 , eq . ( [ lf ] ) , _ and _ in the sm be flavor diagonal _ except _ for the usual yukawa coupling of the _ down _ quarks , which would therefore be the only source of flavor breaking .",
    "the issue of the naturally small masses of the hidden sector scalars has a lot to do with their nature and their possible internal structure , about which little is known .",
    "nevertheless it may be in any case nontrivial to accommodate in a natural picture their large yukawa couplings as in ( [ lh ] ) or in ( [ lf ] ) .    finally , from ( [ lh ] ) a non vanishing vacuum expectation value of @xmath129 gives rise to contribution to the up quark mass , @xmath166 , which needs to be kept under control . in turn , since @xmath167 can not be too small , this is a severe limit on the mixing squared mass term @xmath168 in the scalar potential .",
    "seen another way , the operator @xmath28 leads to a radiative contribution to the up quark mass from a @xmath0 loop .",
    "this radiative correction could be removed , without affecting the multi muon signal , by replacing @xmath169 in @xmath28 and making proper adjustments in the deconstructed versions .",

    "let us assume that the proposed interpretation of the cdf events is correct : a hidden sector with particles of mass of order 10 gev , that decay into @xmath18 s and coupled to the standard model trough new states @xmath171 or @xmath129 with mass in the tev region .",
    "here we suppose that this tev sector is augmented by a stable neutral state @xmath172 that is the dark matter . to connect to the multi - muon data",
    ", we also assume that @xmath172 is also strongly coupled to the hidden sector by the yukawa interactions @xmath173 for fermionic @xmath172 , or the quartic couplings @xmath174 for scalar @xmath172 , so that the dominant dark matter annihilation channels are @xmath175 if this annihilation cross section is large enough , the @xmath19 from @xmath18 decay are able to explain the excess positron cosmic ray signal reported by pamela  @xcite , for @xmath176 tev , for dominant annihilations to @xmath177 respectively . the predicted spectrum for the positron excess is shown in fig .",
    "[ figdm ] , that applies equally well to annihilation via @xmath0 or @xmath178 or @xmath15 for @xmath179 tev , respectively .",
    "since the kinematics is such that the @xmath18 are produced non - relativistically in the rest frame of the decaying hidden sector scalar , the positron spectrum is similar in the three cases .",
    "a smoother spectrum arises if instead dm has more than one annihilation channel with comparable branching ratios .",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein for a discussion of the expected astrophysical backgrounds and uncertainties ) .",
    "the connection with the cdf multi - muon data is that the signals involve @xmath18 decays . as a consequence",
    "there is no associated @xmath180 excess , compatibly with pamela observations  @xcite .",
    "future experiments measuring the positron excess at energies beyond 100 gev should find that the excess persists smoothly to higher energies , with a turnover behavior , shown in fig .",
    "[ figdm ] , that is not as sharp as when annihilations occur directly to electrons or muons .    to obtain the pamela positron excess",
    ", the @xmath181 annihilation cross section must be larger than that required for a thermal freeze - out abundance of @xmath172 by a boost factor @xmath182 independent of whether the annihilation yields 2,4,or 8 @xmath183 pairs .",
    "a contribution to this boost factor arises from a sommerfeld enhancement factor , from a ladder of @xmath0 exchanges between the initial annihilating @xmath172 states , and is significant since @xmath184 . if @xmath172 is a fermion the yukawa coupling @xmath185 leads to this ladder , while for @xmath172 a scalar a new trilinear scalar coupling must be added , @xmath185 . for the case of the yukawa coupling , @xmath186 , the desired thermal freeze - out abundance results if @xmath187 . for @xmath188 in the range of 1 to 10 tev",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement factor is approximately given by @xmath189 comparing with ( [ eq : b ] ) , this is only a factor 5 below the required boost factor .",
    "hence if local clumpiness of the halo provide the extra @xmath190 enhancement , our theory is able to yield the pamela positron excess even with dark matter produced thermally .",
    "such a local clumpiness is helpful in reducing tensions with limits on gamma  @xcite and neutrino fluxes .    in fig .",
    "[ figdm ] we fixed the dm mass @xmath188 trying to reproduce the peak suggested by the atic  @xcite observations of the @xmath20 spectrum below 1 tev .",
    "however , the spectral feature produced via @xmath18 decays ( as suggested by the cdf anomaly ) is less pronounced than that arising from dm annihilations to electrons or muons , so that higher statistics data will test the hypothesis of annihilations via @xmath18 pairs .",
    "spectrum compatible with the model prediction in figure  [ figdm]b . ]",
    "we explored the possibilities for a new - physics interpretation of the cdf multi - muon events , adopting the phenomenological conjecture of @xcite which links the muons to the pair production of two hidden sector scalars , each decaying into 8 @xmath18 leptons . within this conjecture",
    "we addressed the major puzzle left unexplained so far : a plausible production mechanism which could explain the total muon invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the hardness of this spectrum suggests to explore higher - dimension local operators connecting two quarks or gluons to a pair of @xmath0 s , and our systematic search revealed that one such operator , namely the dimension-5 @xmath191 , reproduces the measured distribution for @xmath192 gev .",
    "encouraged by this discovery , and by the ability to reproduce several other experimental distributions , we proceeded to discuss the next crucial question : is it at all conceivable that such a low scale can be generated in a more complete theory without producing any other unseen effect ?",
    "we presented the two minimal ways of solving this problem , either by exchanging an @xmath16-channel new heavy scalar , or by exchanging a @xmath17-channel new heavy quark . in both cases 4-quark operators",
    "are unavoidably generated along with @xmath28 , with a scale of the order a tev . while the comparison with the existing tevatron limits from dijet studies is nontrivial",
    ", our preliminary analysis shows that in both cases no obvious contradiction exists .",
    "furthermore we found that the effects due to momentum dependence of the exchanged particle propagators may not disturb the agreement of the effective - operator limit with the total invariant mass distribution .",
    "we think that all this offers a definite and consistent framework which can be subject to stringent tests by further comparison with the data .",
    "in fact , since the production mechanism is now largely fixed , it should be possible for the experimentalists to pronounce a final word on this model .",
    "we propose possible tests involving muons only ; more tests involving hadronic tracks can be imagined .",
    "if we assume that the proposed interpretation of the cdf events is correct , further work in many different directions can and must be done .",
    "here we have not resisted from drawing a possible connection between the cdf data and the putative dark matter signals seen in pamela and/or atic . assuming that dark matter is a hidden sector particle that annihilates into the @xmath0-scalars decaying into @xmath18 leptons , we explored its indirect signals : one can reproduce the pamela @xmath19 excess and , at higher energies , a feature in the @xmath20 spectrum milder than the one hinted at by the atic data .",
    "we are especially grateful to paolo giromini for many discussions and invaluable clarifications about the multi - muon cdf data .",
