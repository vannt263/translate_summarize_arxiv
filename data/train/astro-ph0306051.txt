    "the brane model is one of the most interesting cosmological scenario proposed in recent times @xcite . for a review of brane",
    "cosmology , see references @xcite .",
    "in its most simple formulation , a five dimensional space - time is considered where a three - brane configuration is settled out . the ordinary matter and fields",
    "are restricted to `` live '' on the brane . only gravity and a cosmological constant term are allowed to `` live '' in the entire four dimensional space , called the _",
    "bulk_. one fundamental aspect of this construction is the fact that the fifth dimension may be compact but not small : this allows to solve the hierarchy problem , explaining why the planck mass in our usual four dimensional space - time takes the huge value @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , the planck mass @xmath3 is related with the five dimensional fundamental mass scale @xmath4 through the relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the characteristic dimension of the fifth dimension .",
    "hence , the bulk gravitational coupling can have values compatible with other physical coupling constants provided the scale @xmath6 is very large , inducing at same time a huge value for the planck mass on the brane . in a very fashion variation of this model ,",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite had considered a five dimensional anti - desitter model ( a negative cosmological constant living in the bulk ) , where gravity has the usual features on the brane even if the fifth dimension is infinite .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of brane cosmology is the presence of a quadratic matter term as source of the einstein equations which describes the gravitational dynamics on the brane .",
    "this quadratic term comes from the matching conditions of the five dimensional einstein equations in presence of a brane , together with the assumption that ordinary matter is restricted to `` live '' on the brane . besides this quadratic term",
    ", there is a dark radiation term ( which may contribute with negative values for the source terms ) as well as a cosmological constant , if a cosmological term is allowed in the bulk .",
    "hence , the dynamics for our universe is very different from that predicted by the traditional standard cosmological model . due to the quadratic character of the new ordinary source term , its effect is in principle important during the very early universe : the contribution of the quadratic term decreases very rapidly as the universe expands .",
    "many cosmological consequences may be extracted from this primordial scenario , and the brane cosmology became the object of intensive studies in these last times . here",
    ", we will address one important point concerning the brane scenario : the primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "in fact , the presence of a quadratic matter term and of a dark radiation term may have many consequences for the abundance of the primordial light elements , like deuterium and helium .",
    "such problem has already been treated in references @xcite . however , in reference @xcite mainly the question of the influence of dark energy has been investigate ; in reference @xcite , on the other hand , a balance between the contribution of the quadratic term and dark energy is required in order that the traditional scenario for nucleosynthesis is not substantially affected .",
    "these authors have kept the main features of primordial nucleosynthesis process , like the energy scales . in reference",
    "@xcite it has been concluded that large negative values for the dark radiation are allowed .    in the present work we will take two main different considerations .",
    "first , we will emphasize the role of the quadratic term in the source of the einstein equations .",
    "this quadratic term changes drastically the temperature curve , and the characteristic energy scales under which the nucleosynthesis takes place becomes completely different with respect to the standard model .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the observed value for the helium abundance implies that the nucleosynthesis is effective between @xmath7 , in contrast with the usual values @xmath8 .",
    "the fundamental mass scale which leads to values for the helium abundance compatible with observational data is of the order of @xmath9 . in this case , the dark radiation and cosmological constant may indeed be neglected at least in what concerns nucleosynthesis . in some sense ,",
    "the analysis performed here is more restrictive than those made in references @xcite since these authors have determined a lower bound for the fundamental mass scale .",
    "however , we must stress that a more general analysis taking into account the contribution of all terms in the brane model , which asks for a substantial modification of the semi - analytical method , may lead to higher values for the fundamental mass scale .",
    "the other aspect that distinguish the present work from the previous ones concerns the employment of the semi - analytical analysis for the helium synthesis which has been developed in reference @xcite .",
    "this semi - analytical analysis , which avoids the use of large numerical codes , is possible if the fermi - dirac statistic is ignored .",
    "even if such statistics seems to be very relevant in the evaluation of the transmutation process that occurs in the primordial nucleosynthesis , it does not affect sensibly the final results : the semi - analytical method leads to a value of the helium abundance only some per cents different from that obtained when the fermi - dirac statistic is taken into account . a very important advantage of using such semi - analytical method concerns the fact that the main physical steps in the computation of the helium abundance may be emphasized .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we sketch the main features of brane cosmology . in section 3",
    ", the semi - analytical method is exposed in its general lines .",
    "its application to the brane cosmology is presented in section 4 , while in section 5 the conclusions are presented .",
    "the brane model to be considered here is the simplest one , which keeps the main features of more complicated models .",
    "this model is constructed in a five - dimensional space - time , where the fifth coordinate is not compact .",
    "this marks a strinking difference with respect to the usual kaluza - klein models . in this model , our usual world",
    "is constrained to a three - brane , where ordinary matter and fields `` live '' .",
    "gravity , on the other side , is defined in the entire five - dimensional space - time .",
    "the field equations read @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the cosmological constant which also `` lives '' in the whole space - time and @xmath13 is the gravitational coupling in five - dimensions .",
    "the five - dimensional space - time is called _ bulk_. the metric describing this configuration is @xmath14 the energy - momentum tensor takes the form @xmath15 where the delta function assures that ordinary matter is confined on the brane which is located at @xmath16 .",
    "the presence of the brane implies the need to impose match conditions through the extrinsic curvature . using the field equations and considering these match conditions",
    ", we end up with the following equation driving the dynamics of the scale factor and matter on the brane : @xmath17 the subscript @xmath18 indicating that all the quantities are evaluated on the brane .",
    "this subscript will be ignored henceforth .",
    "as usual , @xmath19 denotes the curvature of the spatial section , and @xmath20 is an integration constant generally called _ dark radiation _ , since it appears in the equation of motion similarly to a radiation term .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath20 may take any sign .",
    "an important characteristic of brane cosmology is the fact that the matter term appears quadratically in the equation of motion . in what follows",
    ", we neglect the curvature , fixing @xmath21 .",
    "the standard friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology is characterized by a linear matter term , in opposition to equation ( [ em1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is possible in brane cosmology to generate such linear term .",
    "this can be achieved by redefining the matter term as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "hence , ( [ em1 ] ) becomes @xmath24 if we make the identification @xmath25 , the ordinary matter term is reproduced besides the quadratic one . at same time",
    ", a new cosmological term appears .",
    "the total cosmological term may be set equal zero by fine tuning their values .",
    "this is possible mainly in the context of the randall - sundrum model , where an anti - desitter space - time is considered .",
    "since we are dealing with a primordial cosmological model , the matter content of the universe is dominated by radiation .",
    "hence , @xmath26 . in the computation that will be performed later , we will ignore the dark radiation , the linear term for the matter density and cosmological constant terms .",
    "these simplification will be justified a posteriori , since these terms will come out to be smaller than the quadratic matter density one for the energy scales relevant for the nucleosynthesis analysis .",
    "hence , our fundamental equation to be analysed is @xmath27 where we have used the fact that @xmath28 @xmath29 being the effective number of degrees of freedom of the massless particles . since ,",
    "at the moment of the nucleosynthesis there are photons , electron - positron pairs and three types of neutrinos - antineutrinos , @xmath30 .",
    "the gravitational coupling parameter has been redefined as @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 defines the fundamental mass scale of brane cosmology .",
    "the use of the equation ( [ fe ] ) distinguishes strongly the present approach from previous ones . in references",
    "@xcite , it has been used instead of ( [ fe ] ) , the equation @xmath32 the main conclusion was that a large contribution of dark radiation is allowed if @xmath33 .",
    "but , there is one point which must be commented . in those references",
    ", the authors have kept the nucleosynthesis energy scales between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "they established the observational limits on the dark radiation term and on the quadratic term by requiring that these energy scales are not substantially affected by the presence of these new terms . in this way",
    ", the prediction for helium abundance ( as well as for deuterium and lithium ) of the standard model , which agrees remarkably well with the observations , is not affected .    here",
    ", the emphasis will be different",
    ". we will use ( [ fe ] ) and will leave the dynamics of the universe dictates the new range of energy where the nucleosynthesis takes place . in this way , observational limits will be established for the term @xmath4 in equation ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "the main reason for using ( [ fe ] ) comes from the following fact .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of helium depends crucially on the reactions converting free neutrons into proton and on the decay of free neutrons .",
    "the last effect continues until the energy of the universe drops much below the deuterium bindind energy , @xmath36 .",
    "typically the decay of free neutrons continue until about @xmath37 , since the large ratio of photons to baryons assure that even in this energy scale there are enough photons able to dissociate the formed deuterium .",
    "below this energy , deuterium is not dissociated anymore and they can combine to form the helium .",
    "this fact depends only on the statistic of the deuterium immersed in a photonic gas , depending very little on the dynamics of the universe",
    ". however , the reactions converting neutrons to protons are effective until the moment the reaction rate is equal to the rate of the expansion of the universe , when the number of free neutrons due only to this effect is frozen .",
    "the equality between the reaction rate @xmath38 and the rate of the expansion of the universe implies @xmath39 since , in the model dictated by equation ( [ fe ] ) , @xmath40 and the reaction rate for the conversion of neutrons into protons is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fermi constant of the weak interactions , we find that the frozen temperature is given by @xmath43 in opposition with the standard case where @xmath44 we will treat @xmath4 as a free parameter , used to fit the observed helium abundance .",
    "the final results will justify the fact that the quadratic term in fact dominates the right hand side of the einstein equations .",
    "but , before computing this , let us first describe the semi - analytical method to be used .",
    "during the thermal history of the universe , a quark - hadron transition occurs at a temperature higher than @xmath45 .",
    "the primordial nucleosynthesis begins after this phase transition .",
    "initially , the quantity of neutrons and protons is equal .",
    "as the universe expands , the temperature drops , and reactions involving the neutrons , protons , neutrinos and electrons convert neutrons into protons . at same time , since the neutrons are free , and unstable , they also decay into protons .",
    "the reactions converting neutrons into protons ends when its rate is equal to the rate of the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , the decay of free neutrons continues until the energy is low enough in order the neutrons to be captured forming deuterium , from which the helium is formed .",
    "the quantity of helium produced in this process depends essentially on the quantity of neutrons that has survived up to the moment they are captured to form deuterium .",
    "the detailed analysis of all these process is quite involved , requiring the use of numerical codes to evaluate the different transmutation process .",
    "however , semi - analytical expressions can be worked out if the fermi - dirac statistic is neglected .",
    "this has been done in reference @xcite , leading to values for the helium abundance with an error of some percents compared with the precise numerical calculation .",
    "precision is slightly lost by using this semi - analytical analysis , but on the other hand , the physical meaning of the computation becomes more transparent .",
    "we will summarize the main steps and the relevant quantities . for details ,",
    "the reader is invited to address himself to the reference @xcite .",
    "we will consider first the standard cosmological model , deep in the radiative phase .",
    "the ratio of neutrons with respect to the total baryon number as function of the temperature is @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the numbers of neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "the main equation controlling this quantity is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the rates of conversion of protons into neutrons and neutrons into protons respectively . the main process concerned are @xmath52 as an example , the first one is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a coupling constant , the @xmath55 s denote the momenta of each particle involved in the process , @xmath56 the energy and the @xmath57 s represent the fermi - dirac statistic factor . the last process in equation ( [ trans ] ) represents the neutron decay and it is not considered in a first evaluation .",
    "later , the final results will be corrected taking it into account .    in reference",
    "@xcite the evaluation of the first two rates in equation ( [ trans ] ) is simplified by approaching the fermi - dirac statistics by the maxwell - boltzmann one .",
    "this is justified by the fact the temperatures concerned at the moment these process take place are smaller than the energies of the particles . after a lengthy evaluation of all process",
    ", we end up with the following expression for the neutron abundance factor : @xmath58\\ ] ] with the following definitions : @xmath59 \\quad , \\\\ b & = & a\\biggr[\\frac{45}{4\\pi^3n}\\biggl]^{1/2}\\frac{m_p}{\\tau\\delta m^2 } \\quad , \\quad a = 4a\\tau(\\delta m)^5 \\quad , \\quad y = \\frac{\\delta m}{t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the mass difference between neutrons and protons , @xmath61 is a pure number and @xmath62 is the neutron lifetime .",
    "the fraction of neutrons to baryons at the end of all those process , @xmath63 , is obtained by making @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 .",
    "the fact that the integration is performed until @xmath67 , is not important since equation ( [ frac ] ) has yet saturated at @xmath68 , that is , @xmath37 , the temperature for which the neutrons were already captured forming deuterium , and the nucleosynthesis process has finished .    as stated before ,",
    "initially the neutron decay is neglected . to correct the final results due to it we must evaluate the time where the capture process forming the deuterium occurs . this time is obtained , in principle , by evaluating the capture process until a temperature of the order of the deuterium binding energy @xmath69 .",
    "however , lower energies ( of order of @xmath70 ) must be considered due to the fact that the enormous number of photons implies that deuterium dissociation continues to occur even when @xmath71 . in peforming",
    "this analysis , we must take into account the evolution of the universe , which in this case is reflected by the equation @xmath72^{1/2}\\ ] ] since during the radiative phase @xmath73 , @xmath74 being the photon temperature , which is approximately equal to the neutrino temperature at the relevant temperature scales considered in this computation .",
    "moreover , the energy density is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76    the equation ( [ oe ] ) allows to establish a relation between temperature and time .",
    "in doing this we can convert the expression for the neutron decay in terms of the temperature .",
    "the final results imply that time is related with temperature by @xmath77^{1/2}\\biggr[\\frac{11}{4}\\biggl]^{2/3 } \\frac{m_p}{t_{\\gamma0}^2 } + t_0 \\quad .\\ ] ] the constant @xmath78 is @xmath79t_1 \\quad , \\quad t_1 = \\biggr[\\frac{45}{16\\pi^3n_{eff}}\\biggl]^{1/2}\\frac{m_p}{t_{\\gamma0}^2 } \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the photon temperature when the neutron capture is accomplished .",
    "the time of capture is obtained through some statistic considerations , and its expression is given by solving the equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "the final abundance is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the time when the neutrons are captured into deuterium .",
    "the final helium abundance by weight ratio is @xmath85 the complete computation yields @xmath86 .",
    "a more precise computation , using numerical code , gives @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "all the computation of the helium abundance in a brane cosmology definite by equation ( [ fe ] ) is the same as before .",
    "the main changes concerns the computation of the function ( [ oe1 ] ) and the relation ( [ oe2 ] ) due to the employment of equation ( [ fe ] ) instead of the traditional friedmann equation . due to the different dynamics of the universe , driven now by equation ( [ fe ] ) ,",
    "the function ( [ oe1 ] ) is now replaced by @xmath88 where @xmath89 , all other quantities remaining the same .",
    "an important feature of expression ( [ ne1 ] ) is that it does not saturate as in the standard case , due to the presence of the linear and logarithmic terms .",
    "hence , the integration must be performed until the capture time of neutrons into deuterium , and not until @xmath90 .",
    "the behavior of the function ( [ ne1 ] ) , compared with the corresponding function for the standard model , is displayed in figure ( [ figa ] ) .     for the standard model and for the brane model until the capture time . ]",
    "note that the transmutation of neutrons and protons in the brane cosmology remains effective longer after the frozen temperature since the ratio between the expansion of the universe and the reaction rate of weak interactions scales , in the brane model , with @xmath91 , while in the standard model this ratio scales as @xmath92 .    on the other hand , the capture time is also modified by the dynamics of the universe , since relation ( [ oe ] )",
    "is no longer valid , being replaced by @xmath93 this leads to the following new expression for the capture time : @xmath94 where @xmath95 with @xmath96 being the fine structure constant and @xmath97 the proton mass .",
    "all the computations depend on the value of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the results are displayed in table @xmath98 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 : helium abundance in terms of the mass scale value .    from the table @xmath98 ,",
    "it is possible to verify that until a value @xmath99 the value of the five dimensional coupling parameter is so high that it drives a so fast expansion that no transmutation occurs .",
    "hence , the nucleosynthesis period finishes with the same quantity of neutrons it begins , that is , @xmath100 .",
    "all neutrons and protons are used to produce helium , what explains the result @xmath101 . on the other hand , for values of @xmath102 , the expansion is so slow , that no neutrons are left : the number of helium produced is zero .",
    "the values for the five dimensional coupling parameter such that the observational limits for the helium abundance are satisfied imply @xmath103 , giving a very good agreement with the observed value , which is @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "now , we can justify the approximations fixed before .",
    "first notice that the frozen temperature for the best values of the mass scale is now @xmath105 , that near the quark - hadron phase transition temperature .",
    "this is not in principle a problem if this phase transition occurs really a little before that energy .",
    "let us consider now the equation ( [ em2 ] ) .",
    "with those best values for @xmath4 , and making the identification @xmath106 we have at the temperature of @xmath107 , the following values for each term : @xmath108 hence , under these conditions , the two last term in the right hand side of equation ( [ em2 ] ) can indeed be neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "the nucleosynthesis process ends when the energy is about @xmath109 . at this energy , the terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ em2 ] )",
    "read @xmath110 this assures that the quadratic term really dominates over the linear and the constant term during all the nucleosynthesis period , justifying a posteriori our first approximation . concerning the dark radiation term",
    ", we may consider that it can also be ignored during the nucleosynthesis period since its energy density today must not exceed too much the radiation density today .",
    "it scales like the ordinary radiation density ; hence , its value at the nucleosynthesis period must be at most of the order of the linear matter term , much smaller than the quadratic term at least until @xmath37 .",
    "notice however , that the constant term leads to a vacuum energy today of the order @xmath111 , much higher than the observed value @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "even if this cosmological term does not spoil the nucleosynthesis process , it is not compatible with the later evolution of the universe .",
    "the model must be supplemented with a mechanism to circumvent this problem through a dynamical process or a fine tuning .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the primordial production of helium using a semi - analytical approach in the context of brane cosmology .",
    "the main point in this computation was to consider the predominant role of the quadratic matter density in brane cosmology , since this term dominates at very high energy scales .",
    "in doing so , we ignored the contribution of dark radiation .",
    "this assumption was justified a posteriori , since dark radiation and the ordinary linear radiation term are really a subdominant component to energy scales down to @xmath37 , if the fundamental mass scale is such that @xmath113 .    the main difference with respect to previous work on the subject concerns the computation method and the energy scales where the primordial nucleosynthesis occurs . in what concerns the computation method ,",
    "we have opted for a semi - analytical method developed in reference @xcite , which slightly sacrifies the precision but furnishes a more physical insight . concerning the energy scales for the nucleosynthesis ,",
    "we allow them to vary . in references",
    "@xcite , the authors kept the energy scales as the same as in the standard cosmological model , that is @xmath8 .",
    "then , they constrained the dark radiation term and the quadratic matter density term such that the predicted helium abundance remains inside the observational limit . here , on the other hand , the energy scales for the primordial nucleosynthesis were kept free , and we determine them , and at same time the fundamental mass scale , in such a way that the observational data can be reproduced .",
    "the main results can be resumed as follows .",
    "if the mass scale is to small , there is no time for the transmutation of neutrons into protons and all baryons finish to form helium ; no or almost no hydrogen is left .",
    "this , of course , contradicts observations .",
    "however , if the mass scale is too high , essentially all neutrons are transmuted into protons and no helium is produced , contradicting again the observations .",
    "there is an optimal value for the mass scale , where the observational abundance of helium can be produced . for this optimal value ,",
    "the frozen temperature for the transmutation of neutrons into protons is of the order of @xmath105 , while the neutrons capture time inside deuterium remains essentially the same as in the standard scenario , i.e , @xmath37 .",
    "the value for the mass scale is @xmath9 .",
    "these results are quite reasonable . with these values , the initial hypothesis that the contribution of dark radiation , the linear matter density term and of the cosmological constant are negligible are perfectly justified",
    ". however , there are two main difficulties arising from this analysis .",
    "first , the frozen temperature is dangerously near the typical temperature for the quark - hadron phase transition , which is not modified by the change in the dynamics exactly because it is a phase transition .",
    "but , there are yet many discussions on the exact value of the temperature at which this phase transition occurs @xcite .",
    "second , the value of the cosmological constant , even if unimportant for the nucleosynthesis process , is too high in view of current observational limits on the vacuum energy .",
    "some fine tuning is necessary in order to avoid problems in this sense . but this seems to be a common feature of many brane models .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that the analysis performed here is somehow a simplification of the problem : a more complete analysis should taken into account the contribution of all terms , constraining the mass scale in presence of the linear density term and dark energy . but this approach asks for important modifications of the semi - analytical method employed here . in any case , we have shown that a scenario where the quadratic term dominates during nucleosynthesis is possible , provided that the relevant energy scales are modified .    in our point of view , the main contribution of this analysis concerns the value predicted for the mass scale .",
    "it is somehow below other limits . in reference",
    "@xcite for example , the authors have determined a bound such that @xmath114 .",
    "our results are marginally consistent with this bound and , moreover , they set the fundamental mass scale of branes near the terrestrial accelerators energy limit , and very near the scales of other fundamental interactions . if we had taken into account the other contributions , we could obtain a higher value for the mass scale . in view of a more general analysis , the result found here for the mass scale",
    "may be seen as lower bound .",
