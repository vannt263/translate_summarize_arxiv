    "relativistic jets are the most extreme expression of the power that can be generated by supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies .",
    "their bolometric luminosity can reach values up to @xmath8  erg  s@xmath6 , peaking in the @xmath2-ray ( mev - tev ) energy band . to date , two classes of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are known to generate these structures : blazars and radio galaxies , both hosted in giant elliptical galaxies ( blandford & rees 1978 ) . the first class is composed of agns with the jet viewed at small angles and , therefore , the effects of the special relativity play a dominant role in shaping the emission of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "in the second class  radio galaxies  the jets are viewed at larger angles and therefore the doppler boosting is less intense .",
    "the recent discovery of variable @xmath2-ray emission from 4 nls1s confirmed the presence of a third class of agns with relativistic jets ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , b , c , foschini et al .",
    "2010a ) , which was already suggested by the detection of variable radio emission with flat or inverted spectrum ( e.g. grupe et al . 2000 , komossa et al .",
    "2006 , doi et al .",
    "2006 , yuan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this finding poses intriguing questions about jet systems and how these structures are generated .",
    "one of these sources , pmn  j0948@xmath00022 ( @xmath9 ) is classified as a typical nls1 , i.e. fwhm(h@xmath10)@xmath11  km  s@xmath6 , [ oiii]/h@xmath12 , with the presence of the feii bump ( see pogge 2000 for a review on the characteristics of nls1s ) .",
    "however , it displays also strong , compact and variable radio emission , with inverted spectrum , suggesting the presence of a relativistic jet ( zhou et al .",

    "2010a ) . a multiwavelength ( mw ) campaign performed in 2009  march - july displayed coordinated variability at all frequencies , thus confirming that the source detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat is indeed the high - energy counterpart of pmn  j0948@xmath00022 ( abdo et al .",
    "2009c , hereafter `` mw campaign 2009 '' ) .",
    "however , the variability observed in 2009 was much smaller in amplitude ( more than a factor 2 at @xmath2 rays ) with respect to the 2010 campaign .",
    "the main differences between nls1s and the other agns with jets are the optical spectrum and the radio morphology , which is quite compact and without extended structures ( doi et al .",

    "in addition , nls1s are generally hosted in spiral galaxies ( deo et al .",
    "2006 , zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is at odds with the current observational paradigm linking very powerful jets with ellipticals ( cf , e.g. , marscher 2009 ; see also bttcher & dermer 2002 ) . obviously , to make a proper comparison we would need either a direct imaging of the host galaxies of the four @xmath2-nls1s or the morphologies of a similar sample in term of redshift and magnitude distribution .",
    "our sources have redshifts between 0.061 and 0.585 , while the work by deo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is dedicated to a sample with @xmath13 and zhou et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studies the morphology of nls1s with @xmath14 , so there is only a partial overlap .",
    "at least one of the four nls1s detected at @xmath2 rays is definitely hosted by a spiral galaxy ( 1h  0323@xmath0342 , see zhou et al .",
    "2007 , antn et al .",
    "2008 ) , while for the others there are no high - resolution observations available .",
    "therefore , some halo of doubt remains .    despite these uncertainties  worth studying  there are other novelties introduced by the @xmath2-ray detection of nls1s .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the four @xmath2-nls1s point to agns with masses of the central black hole in the range of @xmath15 and high accretion rates ( up to 90% of the eddington value ) .",
    "these values are common for nls1s ( e.g. boller et al .",
    "1996 , grupe 2004 , collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) , but not for blazars or radio galaxies .    another piece of the puzzle is given by the search for the parent population .",
    "indeed , if @xmath2-nls1s seem to be similar to blazars , i.e. with the relativistic jet viewed at small angles , there should be a parent population with the jet viewed at large angles ( as in the case of blazars vs radio galaxies ) . the first source of this type  pks  0558@xmath3504 ( @xmath16 )  has been recently found by gliozzi et al .",
    "therefore , it seems that nls1s could be a set of low mass systems `` parallel '' to blazars and radio galaxies .",
    "a key unknown in this research field was the power released by jets of @xmath2-nls1s . during the early observations and the 2009 mw campaign the maximum measured luminosity of pmn  j0948@xmath00022 , the most powerful of these nls1s , was @xmath17  erg  s@xmath6 ( 0.1@xmath3100  gev ) . on the other hand , it is known that blazars can reach greater luminosities ( see , for example , ghisellini et al .",

    "specifically , when studying the evolution from 2009  may ( mw campaign 2009 ) to 2010  september , we noted a drop in the polarized flux density in the third epoch , coupled with a swing of the electric vector polarization angle ( evpa ) of about 90@xmath67 , which is maintained in the last epoch , even with a much greater polarized flux density ( a factor @xmath68 ) . a similar behavior has been observed  for example  before the 2008  august outburst at @xmath2 rays of the flat - spectrum radio quasar pks  1502@xmath0106 ( @xmath69 , abdo et al .",

    "it would be possible to obtain the same compton dominance with a lower magnetic field , but with greater injected power ( see below ) .",

    "the region emitting the optical - to-@xmath2-ray flux is too compact to be responsible for the radio emission ( its synchrotron flux is self - absorbed ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the variability analysis : the timescales at @xmath2 rays are short , of the order of days or even less than one day , thus requiring a very compact source .",

    ", the figure shows that the nls1 has a more extreme compton dominance : although its radio - to - x - ray luminosity is smaller than that of 3c  273 , the @xmath2-ray power is greater .",
    "if we renormalize the two seds by taking as reference the peak due to the accretion disk emission , then it is necessary to multiply the values of pmn  j0948@xmath00022 by a factor @xmath68 , which in turn is roughly similar to the ratio of the masses of the central black holes ( @xmath86 for pmn  j0948@xmath00022 and @xmath101 for 3c  273 ) . by shifting upward the sed of pmn  j0948@xmath00022 by this value ,",
    "the differences in the radio - to - x - ray emission become negligible , while those at @xmath2 rays are emphasized . at these energies ,",
    "the differences can be explained with the different doppler factor as a consequence of the different viewing angle ( smaller in the case of this nls1 ) .",
    "the basic findings of the present work can be summarized as follows :    * the source reached an observed luminosity of @xmath7  erg  s@xmath6 at @xmath2 rays ( 0.1@xmath3100  gev ) , with day - scale variability and some `` harder when brighter '' spectral behavior .",
    "this is the first time that such a power is measured from a nls1 .",
    "it confirms , beyond any reasonable doubt , that nls1s can host relativistic jets as powerful as those in blazars and radio galaxies , despite the relatively low mass ( @xmath86 ) and the rich environment due to a high accretion rate ( 50% the eddington rate ) . *",
    "the coordinated variability observed at all the available frequencies confirms the typical behavior of relativistic jets , as already shown during the mw campaign 2009 .",
    "particularly , the radio emission peaked about two months after the outburst at @xmath2 rays , although the radio spectral index was already inverted a couple of weeks before the peak in the gev band .",
    "the optical flux changed about one magnitude ( r filter ) during the months before the outburst . *",
    "the morphology at 15  ghz still shows a very compact source ( @xmath102  pc size ) , despite of the great power released at @xmath2 rays .",
    "comparison with previous observations in 2009 shows that the evpa changed @xmath103 at some time between 2009 july and december and this new value is maintained in 2010 .",
    "the linear polarization fraction exceeds 3% , a value greater than that measured in 2009 ( @xmath55% ) . * the comparison with the sed of a typical blazar with a strong accretion disk ( 3c  273 ) shows that the compton dominance is more extreme in the nls1 .",
    "the disagreement of the two seds can be accounted by the differences in mass of the central black hole and doppler factor of the two jets .",
