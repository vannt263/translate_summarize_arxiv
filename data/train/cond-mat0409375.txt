    "statistical analysis of a wide range of physical and other processes have shown the presence of non - gaussian distributions .",
    "they include temperature fluctuations in hard turbulence  @xcite , diffusion in inhomogeneous media  @xcite , and price variations in financial markets  @xcite .",
    "one common characteristic in these distributions is the presence of exponential or power - law tails , signifying a more frequent occurrence of large deviations than expected from a collection of independent , identically distributed events  @xcite .",
    "the width of the distributions have also been shown to scale as the time interval during which the fluctuations occur . based on these properties",
    ", it has been proposed that levy distributions be used to describe fluctuations in the underlying processes  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative explanation for the non - gaussian distributions , namely a non - uniform diffusion rate  @xcite .",
    "the discussion here is based on fluctuations in financial markets .",
    "consider a stock whose price at time @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 .",
    "most financial market analyses are conducted in terms of the  return \" of stock , @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is a reference price .",
    "studies have shown that successive fluctuations in return are uncorrelated  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical analysis assume further that successive events are statistically independent  @xcite .",
    "the traditional theoretical model uses a simple discrete random walk in the logarithm of price to describe the dynamics of an asset in a market .",
    "this model results in a normal , or gaussian distribution of price returns  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "empirical data clearly show that the price return distribution of real markets deviates significantly from a gaussian , especially far from the mean  @xcite .",
    "( for recent reviews see @xcite . )",
    "in particular , some detailed studies  @xcite have found that the tails of the distribution have an asymptotic power law decay , typically with exponents larger than 2 , while others  @xcite have found that the tails of the distribution are better described by an exponential decay .",
    "it has been conjectured that the non - normality observed in real financial markets can be explained by assuming that although successive events may be uncorrelated , the rate of trading depends on the price of the stock  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is assumed that there is a ",
    "consensus \" value @xmath4 of the return , at which point the stochastic fluctuations are minimum , and the level of the fluctuations increase as the return moves away from @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , the rate of transactions depend on the return .",
    "in particular , a large change in price is likely to be followed by large fluctuations .    here",
    ", we explore the implications of the conjecture by studying variations of the traditional model . like the traditional model",
    ", we use an uncorrelated random walk to represent the dynamics of price returns .",
    "however , unlike the former , where the rate of trading is independent of price , our model assumes a rate which increases the deviation of the stock price from @xmath5 . it will be demonstrated that this modification in the dynamics can reproduce the range of non - gaussian behavior of the price return distributions observed empirically in real markets .    if an uncorrelated random walk models fluctuations of price returns , then the continuous dynamics is a diffusive process . in models considered here ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 is assumed to depend on the time elapsed @xmath0 and the return @xmath7 .",
    "it is assumed further that the dependence on @xmath7 is a function of its deviation from the consensus return @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , exact analytical results are presented for the distribution of price returns , valid for an arbitrary functional form of the diffusion coefficient , when @xmath9 is fixed in time .",
    "the analytical solutions for the distributions are obtained by solving the fokker - planck equation for the corresponding diffusive process .",
    "then , two specific functional forms for @xmath6 are considered .",
    "the first form is a piecewise linear function of @xmath10 . while the second is a quadratic function of @xmath11 .",
    "the form of the distributions are obtained analytically .",
    "results from simulations of the corresponding discrete random walks are also presented and shown to be consistent with the analytical forms .",
    "subsequently , we provide results from computations for a model with time dependent consensus value . in conclusion , we summarize the results and discuss their importance for understanding the behavior of real markets .",
    "to obtain an analytical expression for the price return distribution @xmath12 of the diffusive processes we are considering , note that it satisfies the fokker - planck equation  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the diffusion coefficient  @xcite , and @xmath15 is a ( time - dependent ) drift rate  @xcite . for simplicity , we assume @xmath16 for the rest of this analysis . however , the case of non - zero @xmath15 can also be treated using a simple coordinate transformation @xmath17 .    a normalizable solution to eq .

    "note also that the results from the simulation are again consistent with the analytical solutions .",
    "as before , the return distribution also becomes a gaussian in this case when @xmath36 vanishes .",

    "however , the fit is good over a range that shrinks as @xmath36 decreases .",
    "this is expected since the distribution becomes gaussian in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to point out that as @xmath36 is decreased from @xmath54 to @xmath55 the exponent observed in the tail varies from 2 to @xmath54 .",
    "thus , these results reproduce the empirical observations of real markets that find fat tailed price return distributions with exponents ranging from 2 upward .",
    "exponents as large as 7.5 have been reported ,  @xcite , but at these values the results have large error bars .",

    "as has already been mentioned , the price of the stock will fluctuate about the consensus value @xmath9 .",
    "however , contrary to what has thus far been considered , there is no reason to expect that the consensus value should stay fixed .",
    "in fact , it is plausible that with every trade @xmath5 will shift by a small amount toward the value of the current price @xmath1 , or equivalently , that the consensus value of returns @xmath4 will shift toward the value of the current return @xmath7 .",
    "of course , the diffusion constant will change with the consensus value changes to @xmath64 in order to keep its minimum at @xmath65 .    in this section ,",
    "results of random walk simulations which utilize the non - constant diffusion coefficients considered in the previous section , and which allow for the consensus value to change , are presented .",
    "a very simple dynamics for the value the consensus return @xmath66 is considered ; the change in the value at each time step , @xmath67 , is assumed to be proportional to the difference in the current return value and its current value , @xmath68 , \\label{shift}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a constant that we will assume to be small .",
    "there are two essential differences between the simulations discussed in section iii and those in this section .",
    "first , as mentioned above the diffusion constant used is @xmath64 instead of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the time between steps becomes @xmath70 .",
    "second , the value of @xmath66 is varied dynamically using eq.([shift ] ) .",
    "the simulations again begin with the consensus price of the stock equal to its initial value @xmath71 , and therefore the initial value of the consensus return vanishes @xmath72 .",

    "of course , @xmath7 will also fluctuate about the origin . when the value of @xmath7 is near the origin , it is often the case that @xmath73 .",
    "this causes the peak in the distribution of returns @xmath12 to smear out .      to understand the effects of a dynamic consensus value @xmath66 on the distribution of price returns ,",
    "first consider the case of piecewise linear diffusion @xmath64 . as discussed earlier ,",
    "if @xmath74 and @xmath66 is static , this form of the diffusion coefficient will result in an exponential return distribution .",
    "[ figure4 ] and  [ figure6 ] present the results of simulations with dynamic @xmath66 .",
    "as expected from the argument in the previous paragraph , the effect of the dynamics of @xmath66 is to smooth out the peak in @xmath12 .",
