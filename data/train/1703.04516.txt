    "in recent years , twisted commutative algebras ( tca s ) have played an important role in the nascent field of representation stability .",
    "the best known example is the twisted commutative algebra @xmath4 freely generated by a single indeterminate of degree one .",
    "modules over this tca are equivalent to the @xmath3-modules of church  ellenberg ",
    "farb @xcite , and have received a great deal of attention . in @xcite , we studied the module theory of this tca , and established a number of fundamental structural results . the purpose of this paper is to extend these results to tca s freely generated by any number of degree one generators .",
    "this is , we believe , an important step in the development of tca theory , and connects to a number of concrete applications .",
    "let @xmath5 be the tca @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ; this is the tca freely generated by @xmath1 elements of degree  1 .",
    "we identify @xmath5 with the polynomial ring @xmath8 in variables @xmath9 , equipped with its natural @xmath10-action ; @xmath5-modules are required to admit a compatible polynomial @xmath10-action .",
    "( see  [ s : tca ] for complete definitions . )",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand the structure of the module category @xmath11 as best we can .    as a first step",
    ", we introduce the prime spectrum of a tca .",
    "this is defined similarly to the spectrum of a commutative ring , but ( as far as we are concerned in this paper ) is just a topological space .",
    "the spectrum of a tca gives a coarse view of its module category , so determining the spectrum is a good first step in analyzing the structure of modules .",
    "we explicitly determine the spectrum of @xmath5 .",
    "to state our result , we must make a definition .",
    "the * total grassmannian * of @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 , is the following topological space .",
    "as a set , it is the disjoint union of the topological spaces @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "( here we are using the topological space underlying the scheme @xmath14 parametrizing rank @xmath16 quotients of @xmath12 . ) a set @xmath17 is closed if each @xmath18 is closed and moreover @xmath19 is downwards closed in the sense that if a quotient @xmath20 belongs to @xmath19 ( meaning the closed point of @xmath14 it corresponds to belongs to @xmath19 ) then any quotient of @xmath21 also belongs to @xmath19 . we prove :    [ thm : spec ] the spectrum of @xmath5 is canonically homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "in the course of proving this theorem , we classify the irreducible closed subsets of @xmath13 : each is the closure of a unique irreducible closed subset of @xmath14 , for some @xmath16 .",
    "this provides a wealth of interesting prime ideals in @xmath5 : for example , when @xmath22 the space @xmath23 is @xmath24 , and so each irreducible planar curve gives a prime ideal of @xmath5 .",
    "this shows that for @xmath25 there is interesting geometry contained in @xmath5 , contrary to the more rigid structure when @xmath26 .    in joint work with rohit nagpal ( which he kindly allowed us to include in this paper ) ,",
    "we show :    the space @xmath13 has krull dimension @xmath27 .    from this ,",
    "we deduce :    the category @xmath11 has krull  gabriel dimension @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the @xmath16th determinantal ideal .",
    "if we think of the variables @xmath29 as the entries of a @xmath30 matrix , then @xmath31 is generated by the @xmath32 minors of this matrix .",
    "alternatively , in terms of representation theory , @xmath31 is generated by the representation @xmath33 occurring in the cauchy decomposition of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the full subcategory of @xmath11 spanned by modules supported on ( i.e. , locally annihilated by ) @xmath31 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath35 is the category of modules whose support in @xmath13 is contained in @xmath36 .",
    "these categories give a filtration of @xmath11 : @xmath37 we call this the * rank stratification*. let @xmath38 be the serre quotient category .",
    "intuitively , @xmath39 is the piece of @xmath11 corresponding to @xmath40 .",
    "our approach to studying @xmath11 is to first understand the structure of the pieces @xmath39 , and then understand how these pieces fit together to build @xmath11 .",
    "every object of @xmath39 is locally annihilated by a power of @xmath31 .",
    "we concentrate on the subcategory @xmath41 $ ] consisting of objects annihilated by @xmath31 .",
    "the following theorem completely describes this category :    let @xmath42 be the tautological bundle on @xmath14 and let @xmath43 be the tca @xmath44 on @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath41 $ ] is equivalent to @xmath45 , the category of @xmath43-modules locally annihilated by a power of @xmath46 .",
    "every finitely generated object of @xmath39 admits a finite length filtration with graded pieces in @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "thus , for many purposes , the above theorem is sufficient for understanding @xmath39 .",
    "for example , it immediately implies :    the grothendieck group of @xmath39 is canonically isomorphic to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ring of symmetric functions , and thus is free of rank @xmath49 over @xmath48 .",
    "we now describe how @xmath11 is built from its graded pieces . for this",
    "we introduce two functors .",
    "let @xmath50 be an @xmath5-module .",
    "we define @xmath51 to be the maximal submodule of @xmath50 supported on @xmath31 , and we define @xmath52 to be the universal module to which @xmath50 maps that has no non - zero submodule supported on @xmath31 .",
    "we call @xmath52 the * saturation * of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "the functor @xmath53 can be identified with the composition @xmath54 where the first functor is the localization functor and the second is the section functor ( i.e. , the right adjoint to localization ) .",
    "the functors @xmath55 and @xmath53 are left - exact , and we consider their right derived functors .",
    "we refer to @xmath56 as * local cohomology * with respect to the ideal @xmath31 .",
    "the most important result in this paper is the following finiteness theorem :    [ thm : fin ] let @xmath50 be a finitely generated @xmath5-module .",
    "then @xmath57 and @xmath58 are finitely generated for all @xmath59 and vanish for @xmath60 .",
    "this result has a number of important corollaries .",
    "write @xmath61 for the bounded derived category with finitely generated cohomology groups .",
    "write @xmath62 to indicate that the triangulated category @xmath63 admits a semi - orthogonal decomposition into subcategories @xmath64 .",
    "we have a semi - orthogonal decomposition : @xmath65    here @xmath66 is identified with a subcategory of @xmath67 via the functor @xmath68 .",
    "we note that without finiteness conditions , such a decomposition follows almost formally ; to get the decomposition with finiteness conditions imposed requires the theorem .",
    "the functor @xmath69 is essentially the projection onto the subcategory @xmath70 , while the functor @xmath71 is the projection onto @xmath72 .",
    "( this point of view explains the subscripts on these functors . )",
    "we introduce the functor @xmath73 , which projects onto @xmath74 .",
    "we have a canonical isomorphism @xmath75 the projection onto the @xmath16th factor is given by @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , @xmath77 is free of rank @xmath78 as a @xmath48-module .    finally , we prove a structure theorem for @xmath67 that refines the above corollary . for an integer @xmath15 ,",
    "let @xmath79 denote the set of partitions @xmath80 contained in the @xmath81 rectangle ( i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "for @xmath84 , put @xmath85 where @xmath42 is the tautological bundle on @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath86 is the quotient of @xmath87 by the ideal spanned by those copies of @xmath88 where @xmath89 has more than @xmath16 parts .",
    "the classes @xmath90 $ ] with @xmath84 form a @xmath91-basis for @xmath92 , while the classes @xmath93 $ ] form a @xmath48-basis for @xmath77 .",
    "our structure theorem is :    [ thm : struc ] the objects @xmath94 , with @xmath89 arbitrary and @xmath84 , generate @xmath67 , in the sense of triangulated categories .",
    "thus every object of @xmath67 admits a finite filtration where the graded pieces are shifts of modules of this form .",
    "in fact , our results are more precise than this : for instance , we show that the @xmath95 s all appear in a certain order , with the @xmath96 s first , then the @xmath97 s , and so on",
    ". see remark  [ rmk : proof - thm : struc ] for a proof .    when @xmath26 , we showed in @xcite that every object @xmath50 of @xmath98 fits into an exact triangle @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a finite length complex of finitely generated torsion modules and @xmath101 is a finite length complex of finitely generated projective modules .",
    "a finitely generated torsion module admits a finite filtration where the graded pieces have the form @xmath102 , while a finitely generated projective module admits a finite filtration where the graded pieces have the form @xmath103 .",
    "( we note that @xmath104 and @xmath105 . )",
    "thus theorem  [ thm : struc ] is essentially a generalization of the structure theorem from @xcite .",
    "we prove several other results about the structure of @xmath11 .",
    "we mention a few here :    * the extremal pieces of the rank stratification @xmath106 and @xmath107 are equivalent . *",
    "projective @xmath5-modules are injective . *",
    "finitely generated @xmath5-modules have finite injective dimension .    lest the reader extrapolate too far , we offer two warnings : ( a ) for @xmath26 , every finitely generated @xmath5-modules injects into a finitely generated injective @xmath5-module .",
    "this is no longer true for @xmath25 .",
    "( b ) we believe that @xmath39 and @xmath108 are inequivalent for @xmath109 , though we do not have a rigorous proof of this .",
    "koszul duality gives an equivalence between the derived category of @xmath110 modules and the derived category of @xmath111 modules ( assuming some finiteness ) .",
    "the category of polynomial representations of @xmath10 has a transpose functor , which induces an equivalence between @xmath111 modules and @xmath112 modules .",
    "we call the resulting equivalence @xmath113 the * fourier transform*. ( here the `` dfg '' subscript means the @xmath10-multiplicity space of each cohomology sheaf is coherent . )",
    "our main result on it is :    [ thm : ft ] the fourier transform induces an equivalence between @xmath67 and @xmath114 .",
    "this theorem can be unpackaged into a much more concrete statement .",
    "let @xmath50 be an @xmath5-module , and let @xmath115 be its minimal projective resolution .",
    "write @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is a representation of @xmath10 , and let @xmath118 be the degree @xmath119 piece of @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath120 is called the @xmath119th * linear strand * of the resolution . up to a duality and transpose",
    ", @xmath121 is @xmath122 .",
    "thus the above theorem implies that if @xmath50 is a finitely generated @xmath5-module then its resolution has only finitely many non - zero linear strands , and each linear strand ( after applying duality and transpose ) admits the structure of a finitely generated @xmath123-module . thus theorem",
    "[ thm : ft ] is a strong statement about the structure of projective resolutions of @xmath5-modules . in particular",
    ", it implies :    a finitely generated @xmath5-module has finite regularity .",
    "we also prove a duality theorem for local cohomology and saturation with respect to the fourier transform .",
    "we just mention the following version of this result here :    we have @xmath124 .    in other words ,",
    "the fourier transform reverses the rank stratification of @xmath11 .",
    "the results of this paper are of a foundational nature .",
    "we have additional , more concrete results , that build on this foundation ; for reasons of length , we have deferred them to companion papers .",
    "we summarize the main results here .    the first group of results concerns hilbert series . in @xcite ,",
    "the second author introduced a notion of hilbert series for twisted commutative algebras and their modules , and proved a rationality result for the tca s considered in this paper . in @xcite",
    ", we introduced an `` enhanced '' hilbert series that records much more information , and proved a rationality result in the @xmath26 case . using the tools of this paper ,",
    "we have greatly extended this theory .",
    "we can now prove a rationality result for the enhanced hilbert series for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we understand how the pieces of the hilbert series match up with the structure of the category @xmath11 .",
    "we have similar results on the far more subtle poincar series as well .",
    "the second group of results concerns depth and local cohomology .",
    "suppose that @xmath50 is an @xmath5-module .",
    "we can then consider the local cohomology group @xmath57 defined in this paper and , treating it as a polynomial functor , evaluate on @xmath125 .",
    "alternatively , we can take the local cohomology of the @xmath126-module @xmath127 with respect to the ideal @xmath128 .",
    "we show that these two constructions are canonically isomorphic for @xmath129 when @xmath50 is finitely generated .",
    "in particular , this shows that the local cohomology of @xmath127 with respect to determinantal ideals is finitely generated for @xmath129 , and exhibits representation stability in the sense of church  farb @xcite .",
    "we also study the depth of @xmath127 with respect to @xmath128 and show that , for @xmath129 , it has the form @xmath130 for integers @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , we show that if @xmath133 then @xmath134 , and if @xmath135 then the first non - zero local cohomology @xmath57 occurs for @xmath136 .",
    "the third group of results concerns regularity . in @xcite , church and ellenberg",
    "show that the regularity of an @xmath3-module can be controlled in terms of its presentation .",
    "we generalize this result to arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "our theorem states that the regularity of a finitely generated @xmath5-module @xmath137 can be controlled in terms of @xmath138 for @xmath59 up to approximately @xmath139 . as a corollary",
    ", we find that the regularity of the @xmath126-module @xmath127 stabilizes as @xmath140 at a predictable value of @xmath119 ( approximately @xmath139 plus the number of rows in @xmath50 ) .",
    "the second author used the tca s appearing in this paper to study @xmath141-modules , which served as the primary tool in his study of syzygies of the segre embeddings and related varieties @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the category of @xmath5-modules is equivalent to the category of @xmath142-modules , where @xmath142 is the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are injections together with a @xmath1-coloring on the complement of the image .",

    "@xmath5 has been intensively studied in the literature from combinatorial and algebraic perspectives , and we refer the reader to @xcite for some background and additional references .",
    "the homological aspects of this ring were shown to be closely related to the representation theory of the general linear lie superalgebra in @xcite , and this motivates the study of resolutions of its equivariant ideals .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further information and calculations .",
    "our results imply that one can expect certain patterns and universal bounds to appear as the size of the matrix increases .",
