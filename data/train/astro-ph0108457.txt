    "strong magnetic fields of neutron stars , typically of order @xmath3 g ( bhattacharya , & srinivasan 1995 ) are considered crucial to the radio pulsar activity but equilibrium arguments concerning ns magnetic field pressure and ram pressure balance lead to magnetic field strength estimates for heavily accreting ns sources ( for example x - ray bursters ) of @xmath4 g. in these sources no persistent pulsations have been found despite careful searches ( wood et al .",
    "1991 ; vaughan et al . 1994 ) .",
    "different scenarios of magnetic field evolution lead to different estimates of magnetic field strength and decay .",
    "thus , it is desirable to find a direct way of measuring or estimating the neutron star s magnetic field in these binary systems .",
    "any model used to make such estimates should have minimum assumptions about observed data and model relationships to produce accurate results . _ our model , described herein , has only one parameter that can be adjusted for agreement , the magnetic moment .",
    "all other parameters are strongly constrained by observations . _",
    "it develops a new probe of the magnetic field strength and geometry , based on radial magnetoacoustic oscillations .",
    "titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) , hereafter tlm98 , considered the possibility of dynamical adjustments of a keplerian disk to the innermost sub - keplerian boundary conditions to explain most observed qpos in bright low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "they concluded that an isothermal transition sub - keplerian layer between the ns surface and its last keplerian orbit forms as a result of this adjustment .",
    "the tlm98 model is general treatment applicable to both ns and black hole ( bh ) systems .",
    "the primary problem in both ns and bh systems is understanding how the flow changes from pure keplerian to sub - keplerian as a radius decreases to small values .",
    "the tlm98 authors suggested that the discontinuities and abrupt transitions in their solution result from derivatives of quantities such as angular velocities ( weak shocks ) .",
    "subsequently , titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 hereafter , to99 ) identified the transition layer ( tl ) model s corresponding tl viscous frequency @xmath5 and diffusion or break frequency @xmath6 for 4u 1728 - 34 , and predicted values for @xmath7 related to diffusion in the boundary layer .",
    "tlm98 argued that a shock should occur where the keplerian disk adjusts to sub - keplerian flow .",
    "they interpreted the low frequencies as acoustic oscillations and expected them to provide reliable estimates of radial velocities that would be very close to the acoustic velocities .",
    "sco x-1 s derived acoustic velocities ( titarchuk et al .",
    "2001 hereafter tbgf ) translated to a tl plasma temperature , assuming only thermal motion , of about 19 kev",
    ". however photon spectral fitting by tbgf yielded a tl temperature of 2.8 kev .",
    "tbgf attributed this discrepancy to a dominant contribution to the plasma matter energy density from the magnetic field . _",
    "the viscous qpos provide information identifiable with a magnetoacoustic ( ma ) oscillation effect that can be modeled_.    in this _ letter _ , we develop a general formalism for ma radial oscillations in the tl . in  2 , we describe the data sources used to test our ma oscillation model .",
    "the formulation of the problem and derivation of ma frequencies are described in  3 .",
    "we show the results of the ma oscillation interpretation for the to99 qpo viscous frequencies and the best - fit normalization parameters of magnetic field strengths for a number of qpo sources are present in  4 .",
    "our summary and conclusions follow in  5 .",
    "the model can only be applied to qpos in which the full tlm has been worked out and in which the qpos identified with oscillations of a bounded medium have been seen .",
    "all observations referenced herein were made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer s ( rxte ) .",
    "sco x-1 data were obtained during august 3 and 22 , 1997 , february 27 and 28 , 1998 , and june 10 - 13 , 1999 .",
    "data were extracted from research archives for gx 340 + 0 and 4u 1728 - 34 for observations on november 14 , 1998 and february 28 , 1999 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we use the results from observations of 4u 1728 - 32 between february 15-march 1 , 1996 by ford & van der klis ( 1998 )",
    "in the references cited above , the treatment of a magnetic field in a fluid disk has specified neither the multipole order that characterizes the field nor the strength of the field .",
    "we derive the frequency of the qpo associated with ma oscillations and the correlation of the ma frequency with the keplerian frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the ma frequency is derived as the eigenfrequency of the boundary - value problem resulting from a mhd treatment of the interaction of the disk with the magnetic field .",
    "the problem is solved for two limiting boundary conditions encompassing realistic possibilities .",
    "the solution yields a velocity identified as a mixture of the sound speed and the alfvn velocity , becoming either at the appropriate limits .",
    "our treatment does not specify how the eigenfrequency is excited or damped .",
    "however , it makes clear that the qpo is a readily stimulated resonant frequency .    in order to derive the ma oscillation frequencies in the isothermal transition layer",
    ", we consider layer perturbations such that the density @xmath9 , the velocity @xmath10 and @xmath11 . by combining the continuity equation , equation of motion , and an ideal gas equation",
    ", we obtain an equation for ma oscillations ( alfvn 1942 ) @xmath12=f({\\bf v_0 , \\partial v_0/\\partial r , b_0 } , \\rho_0 ) \\label{eq : alven}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the square of the sound velocity ( assumed constant with respect to radius ) and @xmath14 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "to determine the eigenfrequencies of ma oscillations in the tl , we set equation ( [ eq : alven ] ) to zero and introduce a cylindrical coordinate system in the tl with a radial axis in the disk plane , z - axis perpendicular to the plane , and azimuthal axis along the circle in the disk plane [ see fig . 1 in titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov ( 1999 ) , hereafter tok , for the transition layer geometry ] .",
    "the magnetic field acts along a direction in space that is the same throughout the tl , intersecting the disk everywhere at the same angle @xmath15 .",
    "practical ranges for @xmath15 are from a few to @xmath16 degrees ( titarchuk & osherovich 2001 ) . the model used for",
    "all three sources ( see  4 ) assumes that @xmath17 exactly , which reinstates axial symmetry and makes the problem mathematically tractable .",
    "the simplified problem is spatially one dimensional in the radial direction , and oscillations represented by the eigenfunctions are radial fluid movements .",
    "we consider the radial oscillations in the tl for which we should assume that @xmath18 , i.e. , the mean magnetic field strength @xmath19 is perpendicular to the disk and @xmath20 is along the radial direction in the disk .",
    "we wish to explore how solutions for flow in the tl are affected by boundary conditions and b field geometry , for acoustic and magnetic oscillations . under these assumptions ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : alven ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath21 combining this equation with the two boundary conditions of the tl , the neutron star surface @xmath22 and the outer boundary , @xmath23 , defined by the keplerian qpo frequency , allows us to analyze the eigenfrequencies of the ma oscillations in the tl under both the stiff @xmath24 and the free @xmath25 boundary conditions .    in the two extreme cases , either @xmath26 or @xmath27 equation ( [ eq : new_alven ] ) can be examined analytically under the appropriate boundary conditions . introducing a new function @xmath28 in the case of @xmath26 and , @xmath29 , in the case of @xmath27",

    "@xmath39 is the magnetic field strength at a radius @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the tl mean density .",
    "first , we need to find a solution of the eigenvalue problem for equation ( [ eq : partial_alven ] ) under the stiff boundary conditions by obtaining a particular nontrivial solution using the separation variables method , such that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an eigenfunction satisfying @xmath44 and boundary conditions @xmath45 .",

    "the observed low frequency correlation of the khz qpos strongly confine the theoretical dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath8 , which is mostly determined by the magnetic frequency dependence on @xmath8 ( see dashed lines in figure 1 ) and very sensitive to the pole order ( dipole , quadrupole , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "the correction to acoustic oscillations [ the first term in formulas ( 17 - 18 ) ] only slightly changes the theoretical shape of the low frequencies of @xmath8 .",
