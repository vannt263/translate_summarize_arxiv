    "demixing of binary or multicomponent mixtures is a very common phenomenon observed in a broad range of molecular fluids @xcite , polymer solutions and blends @xcite , or colloidal dispersions @xcite .",
    "phase separation is generally associated with differences in the attractive interactions between particles of different chemical species . in polymer solutions these differences",
    "are usually embodied in the flory @xmath0-parameter @xcite , which controls the competition between the entropy of mixing and the total interaction energy , at least within a mean - field picture . on the other hand , in multi - component colloidal systems like binary dispersions involving colloidal particles of very different sizes , or mixtures of colloidal particles and non - adsorbing",
    "polymer , phase separation can be driven by purely repulsive , excluded volume interactions . by mapping the initial multi - component system onto",
    "an _ effective _ one - component system involving only the bigger colloidal particles , the largely entropy - driven demixing can be understood in terms of _ attractive _ depletion interactions induced between the large particles by the smaller species ( the `` depletant '' ) @xcite",
    ". it should however be kept in mind that the initial bare interactions are purely repulsive , albeit strongly non - additive , as in the highly simplified asakura - oosawa model for colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite . in the case of fully additive hard sphere mixtures ,",
    "phase separation has been predicted for sufficiently large size ratios @xcite , but it is now generally believed that the fluid - fluid demixing is metastable , and preempted by freezing @xcite . a significant degree of positive non - additivity of the core radii @xmath1 ( whereby @xmath2 , with @xmath3 ) is required to observe a stable demixing transition in the fluid phase @xcite .",
    "effective interactions between the centres of mass of fractal objects , like linear polymer coils @xcite , star polymers @xcite or dendrimers @xcite , obtained by averaging over individual monomer degrees of freedom , are now known to be very `` soft '' .",
    "more specifically the effective pair potential diverges only logarithmically for overlapping star polymers @xcite , while remaining finite , of the order of @xmath4 , for linear polymers in good solvent @xcite .",
    "this observation has stimulated the investigation of simple models , like finite repulsive step potentials @xcite , or the gaussian core potential @xcite , which was first introduced by stillinger , in a somewhat different context @xcite , namely @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy scale , while @xmath7 determines the range of the effective potential .",
    "it is worth stressing that the `` gaussian core '' model is unrelated to the `` gaussian molecule '' model , which was extensively studied by michael fisher and collaborators @xcite . in the latter model",
    "it is the mayer @xmath8-function , rather than the pair potential , which has a gaussian shape .",
    "simple , penetrable particle models are also widely used in highly coarse - grained simulations of large - scale phenomena within the so - called `` dissipative particle dynamics '' ( dpd ) method @xcite . in dpd",
    ", effective interactions between penetrable fluid `` particles '' are frequently modelled by a simple parabolic potential @xcite : @xmath9 it has recently been realized that binary mixtures of particles with penetrable cores , which interact via generalizations of the gaussian and parabolic potentials and , involving different energy scales @xmath6 and radii @xmath7 for the various species , may phase - separate over appropriate ranges of these parameters .",
    "spinodal instability was first shown to occur for the gaussian core model within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite and binodals as well as interfacial properties were then calculated within the same approximation @xcite .",
    "similarly gibbs ensemble monte carlo simulations have very recently shown that binary systems of soft particles interacting via the parabolic potential phase separate beyond a critical degree of enhanced repulsion between particles of different species , in agreement with flory - like mean field considerations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we systematically extend our earlier results for the gaussian core model @xcite and investigate the range of validity of the rpa by detailed calculations of the pair structure , thermodynamics , and the resulting phase coexistence curve within the much more accurate hypernetted chain ( hnc ) approximation .",
    "the break - down of the rpa is quantified in the physically relevant regime where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which would correspond to the cross - over from dilute to semi - dilute regimes of the underlying binary polymer solution .",
    "the rpa continues to provide reliable first estimates at higher densities .",
    "the model under consideration is the binary gaussian core model ( gcm ) already introduced in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it consists of @xmath12 particles of `` radius '' @xmath13 and @xmath14 particles of `` radius '' @xmath15 in a volume @xmath16 .",
    "the total number density is @xmath17 , while the concentrations of the two species are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the pair potentials are @xmath20 which introduce three length and three energy parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath21 is chosen as unit of length , the system is entirely specified by the 5 dimensionless parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . for a fixed set of dimensionless parameters",
    "the reduced helmholtz free energy per particle , @xmath31 , is a function only of the intensive variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; this may be split into the ideal gas , ideal mixing and excess ( non - ideal ) contributions :    [ eq:4 ] @xmath34    where @xmath35 is an irrelevant de broglie thermal wavelength .",
    "the equation of state @xmath36 , and the chemical potentials @xmath37 follow from the standard thermodynamic relations :    [ eq:5 ] @xmath38    and may likewise be split into ideal and excess contributions . within rpa and hnc",
    ", these excess contributions may be easily expressed in terms of the usual total and direct correlation functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are related by the familiar ornstein - zernike ( oz ) relations @xcite ; these may be used to express the fourier transforms ( ft ) @xmath41 of the total correlation functions in terms of the ft @xmath42 of the direct correlation functions :    [ eq:6 ] @xmath43,\\\\      \\hat{h}_{12}(k ) & = \\frac{1}{\\delta(k ) } \\hat{c}_{12}(k),\\\\      \\hat{h}_{22}(k ) & = \\frac{1}{\\delta(k ) }      \\left[\\hat{c}_{22}(k)(1-\\rho_1 \\hat{c}_{11}(k ) ) + \\rho_1        \\hat{c}_{12}^2(k)\\right ] ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 and @xmath45[1-\\rho_2 \\hat{c}_{22}(k ) ] - \\rho_1 \\rho_2    \\hat{c}_{12}^2(k).\\ ] ] these oz relations must be supplemented by closure relations .",
    "the rpa amounts to simply identifying the @xmath40 with their asymptotic ( large @xmath46 ) behaviour : @xmath47 substitution of the ft s of into the relations and yields explicit expressions for the @xmath41 , which may be transformed back to obtain the @xmath48 .",
    "detailed analytical expressions are given in appendix [ sec : solut - viri - route ] in the special case of mixtures with equal core radii @xmath49 .",
    "the hnc closure relations are @xcite :    [ eq:9 ] @xmath50    an iterative procedure must be used to solve the coupled equations and numerically .",
    "convergence is easily achieved for the binary gcm model over most of the potential parameter space .",
    "in fact the hnc approximation becomes exact in the high density limit ( @xmath51 ) , and is extremely accurate for densities @xmath52 , as shown earlier in the one - component case @xcite .",
    "pair structure data will be examined in greater detail in section 5 .",
    "knowledge of the pair correlation functions allows direct access to thermodynamics , via the compressibility or virial routes @xcite .",
    "being approximate , the rpa and hnc closures are not thermodynamically consistent , i.  e.  the two routes lead to different answers . in the case of the gcm",
    "the two theories become strictly thermodynamically consistent only in the high density limit , @xcite .    within the rpa ,",
    "the compressibility route is equivalent to a simple mean - field ansatz for the free energy @xcite .",
    "this leads immediately to the following analytic expression for the excess part of the reduced free energy @xcite :    [ eq:10 ] @xmath53    where @xmath54 . in the special case of the gcm : @xmath55    the pressure and chemical potentials @xmath56 follow directly from eqns .",
    "( the superscript c refers to the compressibility route ) :    [ eq:12 ] @xmath57    the virial route is considerably more arduous .",
    "the pressure follows from the virial theorem : @xmath58 in the case of the symmetric mixture ( @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ) the rpa pair correlation functions obtained in appendix a may be used to yield the following expression ( the superscript v referring to the virial route ) : @xmath61 where the functions @xmath62 and the roots @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined in appendix [ sec : solut - viri - route ] ( eqns .   and ) . the resulting reduced free energy per particle is obtained by integrating the equation of state with respect to density : @xmath65,\\ ] ] where the polylogarithm @xmath66 is defined in equation .",
    "unfortunately this expression becomes singular for densities larger than the spinodal densities obtained by the compressibility route .",
    "this mathematical artifact discussed in appendix [ sec : solut - viri - route ] does not allow us to use expressions and to construct a phase diagram .",
    "the lack of thermodynamic consistency of the rpa is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] , which compares the compressibility and virial equations of state as a function of density , for a symmetric mixture ; the virial pressures are always lower than their compressibility counterparts , and closer to the nearly exact hnc results , to which we now turn .",
    "the hnc approximation is very nearly thermodynamically consistent in practice , at least for temperatures and densities relevant for polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "hence we have calculated thermodynamic properties within the more convenient virial route with the pressure given by the standard relation , while the chemical potentials may also be directly expressed in terms of the direct and total correlation functions , according to @xcite : @xmath67 - \\rho_\\mu \\hat{c}_{\\nu        \\mu}(k=0)\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that these expressions hold only within the hnc approximation , and are consistent with the virial route .",
    "as mentioned earlier , suitably reduced equilibrium properties of the binary gcm depend on the five dimensionless combinations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . the compressibility version of the rpa thermodynamics ( or equivalently , the mean field approximation ) allows a considerable reduction of this parameter space . from the expressions - it is clear that the radii @xmath1 and energies @xmath73 enter only in the combinations @xmath74 defined in eqn . .",
    "in terms of the reduced density @xmath75 and pressure @xmath76 , the thermodynamic behaviour of the mixture is uniquely determined by the dimensionless ratios @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this remarkable reduction of parameter space holds only for the thermodynamics , but not for the correlation functions , which depend explicitly on the five parameters of the gcm potentials .",
    "the scale invariance of the thermodynamics is broken by the rpa virial route , as is immediately evident form the explicit expressions and ( valid for a symmetric mixture ) ; the same is true within the hnc approximation .",
    "however deviations from rpa - c ( mean - field ) scale invariance are expected to be small in the high density , high temperature regime , where rpa is increasingly accurate , so that the considerable reduction in the number of relevant potential parameters ( from 5 to 2 ) is expected to carry over , at least approximately , to the phase diagrams calculated with rpa - v or hnc thermodynamics , which will be presented in the next section .",
    "the phase behaviour of the binary gcm may be deduced from the knowledge of the reduced free energy per particle @xmath8 as a function of the variables @xmath79 and @xmath33 and from its thermodynamic derivatives ( the pressure and the chemical potentials ) . for suitable values of the potential parameters @xmath73 and @xmath80 ,",
    "the binary gcm becomes unstable against demixing at sufficiently high densities . in terms of the free energy per particle , @xmath81",
    ", the standard thermodynamic stability conditions of a binary mixture read @xcite :    [ eq:17 ] @xmath82    the first condition ensures mechanical stability , while the second inequality guarantees stability against demixing at constant volume ; the third inequality ensures stability of the mixture at constant pressure .",
    "note that the stability at constant pressure is the more restrictive condition .",
    "the subsequent discussion is restricted to demixing at constant pressure .",
    "the vanishing of the l.  h.  s.  of equation , corresponding to the case where the third inequality turns into an equality , signals the occurrence of spinodal instability . within the mean - field ( rpa - c ) approximation , the equation for the spinodal",
    "is easily calculated to be @xcite @xmath83 where :    [ eq:19 ] @xmath84    it is easily inferred from that a spinodal instability occurs whenever @xmath85 .",
    "this region is visualized in figure  [ fig:2 ] in a plot of the minimum energy ratio @xmath86 required for spinodal instability , as a function of the size ratio @xmath87 .",
    "the radius @xmath88 is taken to be given by the combination rule : @xmath89 as suggested by renormalization group ( rg ) calculations @xcite and by direct simulation @xcite of mixtures of self - avoiding polymer coils .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] also shows the values of the ratio @xmath90 , as calculated for two self - avoiding walk polymers by rg techniques @xcite , plotted as a function of the ratio of their radii of gyration .",
    "the figure suggests that phase separation of real polymers would only be observed for ratios of gyration radii larger than 10 , i.  e.  for mixtures of very long and very short polymers .",
    "however , the rg results are probably not trustworthy for such asymmetric mixtures , and the rg potentials are strictly valid only in the infinite dilution limit .    the spinodal line in the @xmath91-plane is easily calculated from to be : @xmath92 ^ 2 + 4 x ( 1-x ) \\delta v}}{2    x ( 1-x ) \\delta v}\\ ] ] the critical concentration is determined by the condition : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the pressure calculated from , at the spinodal density given by .",
    "the corresponding critical density @xmath95 , calculated by substituting the critical concentration determined by is plotted in figure  [ fig:3 ] versus the ratio @xmath78 , for several ratios @xmath96 .",
    "the binodal or phase coexistence curves in the @xmath97 plane are determined by the usual conditions of equality of the chemical potentials of both species and of the pressures in the two phases , using expressions - .",
    "the resulting equations must in general be solved numerically to yield the binodal curves .",
    "the complete phase diagram can however be calculated analytically within the rpa - c approximation , in the symmetric case , where @xmath60 . due to the symmetry of the problem",
    ", all thermodynamic quantities must be invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this simplification allows the fully analytic treatment detailed in appendix b. the resulting spinodal and binodal are shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] in the case where @xmath100 .",
    "the same figure also shows the hnc binodals , for several values of @xmath70 ( remember that within rpa - c all these binodals coincide ) .",
    "as expected the hnc results break the scale invariance of rpa - c and shift the binodal curves upward , to higher densities .",
    "the hnc and rpa - c critical densities differ by almost a factor of 2 for @xmath101 , pointing to the limitations of the mean - field ( rpa - c ) description .",
    "an example of a phase diagram in an asymmetric mixture , with potential parameters already used in earlier rpa calculations @xcite , is shown in figure  [ fig:5a ] in the @xmath97 plane and in figure  [ fig:5b ] in the @xmath91 plane .",
    "the spinodal and binodal curves are now asymmetric , and the difference between rpa - c and hnc results is again significant , with the hnc binodal being pushed to higher densities .",
    "phase separation in binary mixtures of particles interacting via the closely related parabolic core potentials has been observed in the gibbs ensemble monte carlo simulations of wijmans et al .",
    "they considered the symmetric case where all @xmath1 are equal , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we have calculated the binodal in the @xmath104 plane under the same conditions as the mc simulations , i.  e.  for @xmath105 , in the rpa and hnc approximations .",
    "the results are compared to the mc data in figure [ fig:6a ] . in view of the fact that the amplitude of the parabolic repulsion is @xmath106 , which makes it more hard - core like",
    ", the agreement may be considered to be rather satisfactory . as in the gcm case ,",
    "the hnc coexistence - curve lies well above its rpa counterpart ; it is closer to the simulation data .",
    "the pair correlation functions @xmath48 of the gcm mixture can be calculated by combining the oz relations with either the rpa closure or the hnc closure . in the symmetric case , characterized by a single gaussian range parameter @xmath59 , analytic expressions , in the form of infinite series ,",
    "can be obtained for the rpa closure , as shown in appendix a. in the asymmetric case , solutions for the @xmath48 are readily obtained by numerical fourier transformation of equations and , using the straightforward fourier transforms of the @xmath40 given by .",
    "the hnc closure requires an iterative solution of the coupled oz and closure equations .",
    "this was achieved using the standard picard method , and well - converged solutions were generally obtained in a few iterations .",
    "convergence was found to be slower in the vicinity of phase coexistence , and to break down rapidly inside the phase coexistence region corresponding to metastable mixtures .",
    "concentration fluctuations build up in that region , as signalled by a @xmath107 peak of growing amplitude in the @xmath41 , or equivalently in the corresponding partial structure factors @xmath108 the concentration - concentration structure factor : @xmath109 satisfies the long wavelength limit @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the gibbs free energy .",
    "the cross - over from metastable to unstable mixture corresponds to the vanishing of @xmath112 , so that @xmath113 is expected to diverge along a spinodal line .",
    "this is indeed the case with the rpa closure , but the hnc closure ceases to converge before a spinodal line is reached , a well - known shortcoming of the hnc closure @xcite . such a break - down is typical of the inadequacy of fluid integral equations to describe critical behaviour @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of hnc in the stable one - phase region for the pair correlation function @xmath114 , already documented in the one - component gcm @xcite , is tested under more severe conditions ( namely @xmath115 ) in figure  [ fig:6 ] against recent monte carlo data @xcite for the parabolic core potential .",
    "the agreement is seen to be excellent .",
    "this suggests that the hnc closure would be very useful to generate pair structure in coarse - grained dpd fluids at a moderate computational cost .",
    "examples of pair correlation functions and partial structure factors for several states of gcm mixtures are shown in figures  [ fig:7]-[fig:9 ] .",
    "the most striking feature is the amount of structure observed both in @xmath46 and in @xmath116-space , even within the rpa , compared to the previously studied one - component case @xcite .",
    "the peak in the structure factors at @xmath117 as the spinodal is approached is expected , as explained earlier .",
    "more surprising perhaps is the appearance of peaks in the pair correlation functions as @xmath118 , or at finite @xmath46 .",
    "peaks at @xmath119 are of course precluded in the presence of hard cores , but are quite significant in the present penetrable core model and point to a novel physical mechanism to trigger phase separation , namely the clustering of the minority species , as observed e.  g.  in figure [ fig:9 ] for the symmetric case .",
    "the clustering can be explained by a simple `` energetic '' argument : the particles of the majority species tend to maximise their mutual distances .",
    "if the repulsion between unlike particles is stronger than between like ones , particles of the minority species prefer to cluster in the voids left by the majority species , rather than overlap with particles of the latter .",
    "this mechanism drives phase separation .",
    "the two - component extension of the gaussian core model leads to non - trivial phase behaviour , which we have investigated within rpa and hnc theories .",
    "the former is partially analytic , while the latter requires only a modest numerical effort to calculate partial pair correlation functions and the resulting thermodynamic properties . while the pair structure shows some unexpected features , the most interesting prediction is the occurrence of phase separation induced by purely repulsive pair interactions .",
    "as expected for this model of penetrable particles , phase separation is driven by an enhanced repulsion between unlike particles compared to the like - particle interaction .",
    "a special feature of the gcm mixtures is that at high densities of both species , the mixture behaves like a `` mean field fluid '' , i.   e.  the rpa becomes asymptotically exact @xcite .",
    "this means that at finite densities , the rpa makes semi - quantitavely valid predictions for the phase behaviour , and allows a rapid exploration of potential parameter space to search for likely conditions for phase separation .",
    "the nature of the link between the behaviour of the binary gcm and that of a binary polymer solution must still be worked out in detail , mainly because the effective interactions between the centres of mass of the polymer coils are state - dependent @xcite . for a one - component system at lower densities , the structure is not very sensitive to the state - dependence @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect the binary gcm to make qualitatively correct predictions for the structure of binary polymer solutions in the dilute and beginning of the semi - dilute regimes .",
    "the link to the phase - behaviour is less clear .",
    "because the gcm uses a fixed potential , it is mainly relevant to behaviour in the dilute regime .",
    "while polymers in a melt are known to phase - separate rather easily @xcite , in the dilute regime for good solvents they are not expected to phase - separate @xcite .",
    "this appears to be confirmed by the results shown in fig 2 .",
    "however , it may be that for poorer solvent , or for stronger polymer incompatibilities , a regime where the polymers phase - separate at low densities could open up .",
    "if this is the case , then the binary gcm would be a useful coarse - grained model with which one could rapidly explore the qualitative phase behaviour of this regime .",
    "another open question relates to the critical behaviour of the binary gcm in the immediate vicinity of the critical consolute point .",
    "the rpa clearly predicts mean field exponents.as regards the exact exponents , it is not obvious whether the correct critical behaviour of the model necessarily belongs to the ising universality class , since there is no clear correspondence between gcm mixtures and standard lattice models , due to the penetrability of the particles . the question of the correct universality class , a subject dear to the heart of michael fisher , must be considered as open .",
    "r. finken is indebted to the oppenheimer fund for their support .",
    "a. a. louis would like to thank the isaac newton trust , cambridge , for funding .",
    "we consider the gcm where the potentials have equal range @xmath120 , and the heights of the repulsion potentials of like particles are the same for both species @xmath121 . without loss of generality we can set @xmath122 .",
    "then we have @xmath123 with @xmath124 if we introduce the abbreviation @xmath125 and set @xmath126 , the oz equations reduce to ( using equation ):",
