    "since february 2002 , the rhessi ( reuven ramaty high - energy spectroscopic imager ) satellite carries out x - ray and @xmath0-ray observations of flares and other forms of solar magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "in particular , the 3    25  kev spectral band is of great relevance . it is comprehensive of the thermal and non - thermal domain of the bremsstrahlung , giving us information about the energy deposition of the particles accelerated in the impulsive phase .",
    "the low - energy non - thermal electrons are especially crucial in small events and in microflares . besides",
    ", a broadened emission line feature at around 6.7  kev , mainly due to fe ions , and a weaker line feature at around 8  kev due to fe and ni ions are observable and can give information on electron distributions different from the ones obtained from the bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "the x - ray band 3    25  kev is observed by rhessi with unprecedented spectral resolution ( 1  kev ) and imaging capability ( 2.3@xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , when both attenuators are out , rhessi has a much larger effective area than any earlier instrument , providing information on low - level energy releases with much higher sensitivity .",
    "these rhessi characteristics allow extensive studies of microflares related to both imaging and spectra ( among others : , , , , ) .",
    "images at low energy of these small events are generally reconstructed using the _",
    "clean _ algorithm available in rhessi software ( , ) .",
    "in fact , in this process of image reconstructions , _ clean _ , together with _ pixon _ @xcite and _ forward - fit _",
    "@xcite , converge to the best solutions for a simple source morphology and the photometric accuracy seems to be uniform in different energy ranges higher than 10  kev @xcite .",
    "it may be of interest to test the photometric accuracy and the consistency of the image reconstruction algorithms for more complex sources and lower energies .",
    "it seems quite established that at the peak time of a flare the observed spectra up to @xmath2  kev can be fitted with a single thermal model ( t @xmath2  mk ) of the photon spectrum . at higher energies",
    "a good fit can be obtained adding a non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission with energy cutoff below 10  kev and a power - law index @xmath0 between 5 and 8 , meaning that the spectra of small flares are usually softer than the ones of large flares .",
    "obtained a good fit of a microflare spectrum at the maximum phase also adding a second thermal component with higher temperature ( t@xmath3  mk ) , but they reject this interpretation because this hotter component is no more present during the cooling and then the behaviour of the photons higher than 10  kev is more consistent with the standard flare scenario of precipitating non - thermal electrons . during the decay phase instead , the spectra can be fitted either with a thermal component only @xcite or with a non - thermal component with an index @xmath4 ( , ) .",
    "therefore it is very important to study the behaviour of the spectra of small flares during their evolution in order to investigate if the hardness of the spectrum changes with time , as can be observed in larger flares that show a direct correlation between the hard x - ray flux and the spectral hardness ( , , ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a study on the morphological and spectral properties of two small flares ( goes class c2 and c1 ) in the energy range 3    25  kev .",
    "in particular we compare the image reconstruction algorithms to carefully check the characteristics of these two events at these low energies , when both attenuators are out , and we investigate how their x - ray spectrum evolves with time .",
    "an observing campaign coordinated between ground and space based instruments was planned to observe flare events , sampling the solar atmosphere from the chromosphere to the corona .",
    "monochromatic images at several wavelengths , in the continuum and within the h@xmath5 line have been acquired by means of the tunable universal birefringent filter ( ubf ) and the zeiss filter at the dunn solar tower of the national solar observatory ( nso ) / sacramento peak .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) is of about 150@xmath1@xmath6150@xmath1  with a spatial scale of 0.5@xmath1@xmath60.5@xmath1  and a temporal cadence of few seconds .",
    "spectra have been acquired with the horizontal spectrograph in 3 chromospheric lines ( ca  ii  k , he  i  d3 and h@xmath0 ) , with a temporal cadence of 4  s. simultaneously , spectroheliograms of the same region were obtained in transition region and coronal lines with the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) aboard soho @xcite . during this campaign we observed the region noaa ar 10061 ( n10w20 ) on 2002",
    "august 11 from 14:00 to 19:00 ut . two homologous flares ( goes class c2 and c1 ) developed in this region around 14:40  ut and",
    "16:25  ut . in this paper we mainly concentrate on the diagnostic provided by rhessi in conjunction with h@xmath5 data .",
    "the flare dynamics , using also spectra from nso and cds , will be analyzed in a later paper .",
    "the image of the whole active region at 14:41:47  ut ( figure [ ima : hasta ] ) , acquired with the hasta telescope ( san juan , argentina ) in the blue wing of h@xmath5 line , shows the two ribbons developed during the first flare .",
    "unfortunately the fov of the ubf ( indicated in figure  [ ima : hasta ] by the white box ) includes only the western ribbon of the flare .    in figure  [ ima : ubf ]",
    "we show the high resolution images obtained with ubf in the h@xmath5 line center during the two flares .    , approximately at the peak time of the first flare ( west at right , north at top ) .",
    "two bright ribbons are clearly visible .",
    "the white box ( 150@xmath1@xmath6 150@xmath1 ) , that includes only one ribbon , indicates the fov of the ubf / national solar observatory .",

    "the white line indicates the apparent magnetic neutral line obtained from mdi / soho data . at 14:41:48 , the time of the maximum of the first flare , only one ribbon is within the fov",
    "( see figure  [ ima : hasta ] ) . at 16:31:09",
    "ut , the peak time of the second flare , the ribbons follow the underlying filament and appear very close to each other.,width=453 ]    both flares have the characteristics of eruptive two - ribbon flares and are indeed triggered by the eruption of different portions of the same filament .",
    "however they exhibit very different morphologies .",
    "the upper panels show that the upper eastern part of the filament disappears at 14:14:57  ut .",
    "the emission maximum of the western ribbon is reached at 14:41:48  ut when two extended parallel ribbons developed in ne - sw direction ( see figure  [ ima : hasta ] ) , at the two sides of the filament .",
    "mdi / soho @xcite full disk magnetogram taken at 14:27:34  ut is used to determine the position of the apparent magnetic neutral line and the alignment , done using mdi and ubf continuum , is estimated to be within 1@xmath1 .",
    "the neutral line follows very well the filament and the ribbon positions hint at a system of large coronal loops ( @xmath7  km ) in east - west direction .",
    "bottom panels show that at 16:00:16  ut the emission from the first episode has almost disappeared and the whole filament is visible . at 16:31",
    "ut very compact ribbons develop nearby the central part of the filament , suggesting the presence of stressed and lower loops . at 17:13:31  ut",
    "the filament structure is again in the pre - flare conditions .",
    "figure [ crv : all ] shows the light curves of the two events observed in soft x - rays at 1    8   by goes , in the energy bins 3    6 and 12",
    "  25  kev by rhessi and in h@xmath5 line center by ubf .",
    "we notice that goes recorded a c1 flare at about 15:50  ut which did not occur in the observed active region , and that goes and ubf light curves are very similar for the two studied flaring episodes .",
    "rhessi was in its night during the impulsive phase of the first event and acquired data only during its decay phase .",
    "for the second event rhessi exited from its night just after the very first spike at 16:25:54  ut , well visible in the h@xmath5 curve , missing the beginning of the impulsive phase .",
    "the significant increase of the counts in the time interval 14:56  ut - 15:12  ut , at energies higher than 10  kev , is due to charged particle precipitation event and then the data in this time interval can not be considered .",
    "rhessi had both thin and thick attenuators out for the whole time interval .",
    "in rhessi software 5 different algorithms have been implemented to reconstruct images from the ` back projection ' map , which contains sidelobes due to the modulation pattern of the collimators",
    ". carried out a comparative study on the accuracy of the algorithms between 10 and 60  kev for a strong flare with two resolved sources .",
    "we did analyze the efficiency and the accuracy of different algorithms in the energy range 3    25  kev when both thin and thick attenuators are out and for two different source morphologies , i.e. : an extended and a compact flare .",
    "this energy range is crucial for the understanding of small flares and it might present different problems because of instrumental performances .",
    "the minimum fov to include all features of this complex - source flare is 128@xmath1@xmath8128@xmath1  ( larger black box in figure  [ ima : hasta ] ) , centered on the point with solar coordinates ( 340,80 ) , which seems to be the center of the x - ray emission .",
    "we reconstructed the images with a pixel size of 2@xmath1@xmath6 2@xmath1considering a time interval @xmath9  s which is short enough to give a low flux gradient at the considered time .",
    "we set off the time variability option ( see later ) .",
    "the choice of collimators that contributed usefully to the definition of images has been accurate even if there is a certain arbitrariness .",
    "collimator 2 can not be employed for imaging below 20  kev due to a failure during the early phases of the mission @xcite .",
    "we made separate back - projection images for each other collimator and discarded those which show no obvious source . at the end",
    ", we decided to use collimators 5    8 ( fwhm of the lower grid = 20.4@xmath1 ) .",
    "collimator 9 ( fwhm of 186@xmath1 ) is excluded , as its low resolution does not add any new features , given the field of 128@xmath1 .",
    "collimator 7 is also excluded in the 3    6 kev range because its energy threshold is 7  kev and its resolution is 3  kev .",
    "the reduced number of detectors used ( only 3 over 9 in the 3    6 kev range ) could raise concerns on the results of this comparative analysis .",
    "however , we will show in the next sections that the source parameters are not strongly affected by the number of detectors used in the reconstruction process .",
    "we compare the results obtained using four imaging algorithms available in the rhessi data analysis software ( _ pixon , forward - fit , mem - sato , clean _ ) .",
    "we tried also the _ mem - vis _ algorithm but we could not obtain the convergence for this method . due to the complexity of the source , to obtain a good reconstructed image with _ forward - fit _ we had to use 4 elliptical gaussians .",
    "we considered the three energy ranges 3    6 , 6    12 and 12  ",
    "25 kev , but we had to exclude from our analysis the latter range , because the pileup effect is important for this flare ( see sect .",
    "[ spe : pile ] ) .",
    "no correction for pileup is currently available for imaging , because the magnitude of the pileup varies on the same short timescales as the modulation , thus an exact correction for pileup would require an a priori knowledge of the image at all energies ( hurford , private communication ) .    in figure  [ imag : exten ] we show the contours of the images obtained with the different algorithms in the 3    6 and 6    12 kev range at 14:50:30  ut ( all rhessi times refer to the center of the adopted integration interval ) .",
    "the other selected times provide very similar results and are not presented here .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected , the choice of background for this very weak flare heavily affects the parameters of the cold thermal spectrum : the em obtained subtracting the night background is approximately twice the em obtained with the post - flare background while the temperature is on the average 0.5  mk lower . on the contrary",
    "the fitting parameters that characterize the power - law or the hot components are not substantially altered by the background as was also found by . in table",
    "[ fit_compact ] we give the parameters obtained for the 3 models taking into account the post - flare background spectra ( see sec .",
    "[ spe : cho_back ] ) . in the rise and peak phases of the flare",
    "the non - thermal spectrum has a @xmath0 of about 7 while in the decay phase @xmath0 increases up to 10 , as in the decay phase of the other flare .",
    "the high value of @xmath0 reached when the emission decreases , indicates a softening of the emission with respect to the peak phase . if we assume a double thermal model , the hot component is always present during the flare and has a temperature t @xmath10 20  mk ( compared to 10  mk of the cold one ) and an em two orders of magnitude lower than that of the cold component .",
    "the temperature we found is anyway quite lower than the 35  mk indicated for the so called `` superhot '' component first identified by and afterward defined as the component giving rise to the fe  xxvi emission lines observed in large flares with bcs on yohkoh ( see e.g. ) .",
    "an important result is that , for both flares , only towards the end of the decay phase the best fit can be obtained with a thermal photon spectrum while during the flare the best fit can be obtained , with comparable @xmath11 values , adding either a non - thermal component or a hot thermal component .",
    "the two models are equivalent on this statistical base and it is difficult to select the best model to interpret the observations .",
    "we try to use the fe line feature at 6.7  kev , well visible in our observed spectra , to choose between these two models .",
    "computed synthetic spectra using the chianti code and found that this feature becomes visible above the continuum only when t @xmath12  mk ( with an em @xmath13  @xmath14 ) .",
    "its equivalent width gives the best temperature diagnostic reaching a value of 3  kev for temperature t @xmath10 20  mk .",
    "we measured the equivalent width of this line in the count spectra and we found a value always @xmath15  kev that indicates a thermal plasma with t  @xmath16  mk .",
    "we hence believe that the observed spectra could be better interpreted adding a non - thermal spectrum to a thermal one .    from the fit parameters we can compute the thermal and the non - thermal contribution to the flare energy budget , assuming that the accelerated electrons lose their energy primarily through coulomb collisions in the thick target approximation @xcite :    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , t and _ em _ the temperature and the emission measure of the thermal part , v the volume of the source , @xmath20 the standard beta function , _ a _ the normalization factor of the photon spectrum , @xmath21 the energy cutoff , and @xmath22 t the time interval .",
    "t , _ em _ , @xmath0 and _ a _ are derived from the fitting .",
    "we estimated _ v _ from the flare size ( see @xmath23 in table  [ tab : comp ] ) .",
    "for the extended flare we have observations only during the decay phase and we find @xmath24  erg and @xmath25  erg . for the compact flare",
    "we find that both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are approximately constant during the flare with @xmath28  erg and @xmath29  erg .",
    "thus , the non - thermal energy is higher than the thermal energy by about a factor 10 not only in the rise and peak phases of the second flare but also during the decay phase of both flares .",
    "the high value of the @xmath0 index in this phase , that indicates a softening of the emission , balances the low value of the normalization factor of the photon spectrum _ a_.",
    "this means that the non - thermal electron energy is the energy supply for the heating of the thermal plasma .",
    "this result can thus be considered an a posteriori support to the non - thermal model choice .",
    "we use rhessi data and ground based observations to study two small flares ( goes class c1 and c2 ) developed in the same active region with different characteristics : the first is a two - ribbon extended flare implying high coronal loops while the other is a compact two ribbon implying low - lying loops .",
    "this is reflected in rhessi imaging at different energies that outline the loop morphology in the two cases .",
    "we analyzed the accuracy of different algorithms implemented in the rhessi software to reconstruct the image of the emitting sources , for energies ( between 3 and 12 kev ) that are particularly important when studying microflares .",
    "we found that all tested algorithms give similar results for the peak positions and the total flux on the considered fov , as found by for higher energies .",
    "the peak flux values and the linear sizes differ at most by a factor 2 .",
    "_ clean _ gives always the lowest peak and the largest size ( does not deconvolve from the psf of the instrument ) while the other algorithms give very similar results .",
    "_ clean _ can give additional problems even if the flare structure is simple .",
    "in fact for our compact flare it shows very high negative residuals out of the main source and then does not conserve the total flux over the fov .",
    "the available option to correct for residual map does not help to solve the problem .",
    "_ mem - sato _ always gives the highest value for h / c , i.e. tends to spread more photons out of the source than the other methods , as found by .",
    "_ pixon _ and _ forward - fit _ do converge to similar results .",
    "both algorithms have the option to detect and remove the unmodulated flux present in rhessi data . _",
    "forward - fit _ finds a unmodulated component that slightly changes the source parameters for both flares , while in the case of extended complex flare , _ pixon _ finds a component that strongly changes the source parameters . on the other hand , _ forward - fit _ is not able to reproduce the real complexity of the source , hence we used",
    "_ pixon _ ( without background correction ) to reconstruct the images of the two flares during their evolution .",
    "in fact , while the reliability of _ pixon _ is not surprising , the most relevant result of our study is that each other method can meet significant problems , and special care is always required employing them . in any case , we outline the importance of comparing different algorithms when analyzing events in order to establish whether the reconstructed features are real or not .",
    "we studied the spectral characteristics of our flares by fitting the count spectra with 3 different models of photon spectrum : a single isothermal spectrum , an isothermal plus a non - thermal spectrum and a third one with two isothermal components .",
    "the photon spectrum seems to depend on the flare phase .",
    "the single thermal model is adequate to fit the observations only during the very final decay phase . during the flare , instead",
    ", the single thermal model provides @xmath11 values a factor of 10 higher than the one obtained with the other two models .",
    "the non - thermal and the double thermal fits are comparable , and the choice between them can not rely on statistics .",
    "the measured equivalent width of the fe line feature at 6.7  kev is low compared to that expected for a plasma at 20  mk .",
    "although further investigation is necessary , this may suggest that the hot thermal component is not relevant to the total emission .",
    "for the non - thermal spectrum we determined the energy cutoff value at 7  kev as the one that gives the lowest @xmath11 in the fitting .",
    "for the rise and peak phase we found a photon spectral index of 7    8 , quite high for standard flares , but not so uncommon in microflares ( , ) , while during the decay phase @xmath0 increases up to 10 , indicating a softening of the emission with respect to the peak phase .",
    "with such a steep spectrum and a low energy cutoff the non - thermal energy contribution to the energy budget of the flare is always higher than the thermal one and perhaps the non - thermal electrons provide the energy for heating the thermal plasma through collisional loss .",
    "as a `` by - product '' of our spectral study , we found that the pileup effect , usually observed during large flares , must be taken into account also for weak flares and that the correction enabled in the rhessi software can give serious problems for the recovering of the spectra in the 3    25  kev energy range .",
    "we want to stress that the presence of pileup also affects the image reconstruction process , yielding unreliable images , because the photon energies are uncertain .",
