    "traditionally , the electron self - energy is often determined via diagram expansion methods.@xcite diagrams to low order in the interaction strength can be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "it may also be possible to sum certain classes of diagrams to infinite order .",
    "for instance , the lowest order diagram in the screened coulomb interaction , the gw method,@xcite gives reasonable results for moderately correlated systems , such as free - electron - like metals and semiconductors.@xcite even in the case of a strongly correlated system like nio certain aspects are described reasonably well , but , still , important parts of the physics are believed to be missing.@xcite including the next order terms in such an expansion can even lead to wrong analytical behavior.@xcite improving further in this respect , would require the consideration of the contributions to the electron self - energy of different channels simultaneously , as it is done in flex,@xcite functional renormalization group,@xcite or the parquet approximation.@xcite despite the ever increasing numerical workload of these schemes , they often do not improve upon the gw for the description of crucial aspects of correlated systems .",
    "for instance , they also fail to capture the physics of the mott - hubbard metal insulator transition , whose nature is intrinsically non - perturbative .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "completely different _ and _ non - perturbative methods , such as self - consistently embedded impurity / cluster algorithms like the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite , dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite and cellular dmft ( cdmft)@xcite have been introduced , and are now widely used . in such methods , a cluster with a finite number ( @xmath0 ) of atoms",
    "is embedded in a self - consistent host of noninteracting electrons .",
    "the cluster problem can be solved by diagonalization algorithms but for most cases quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are more efficient , e.g. , in its hirsch - fye@xcite or continuous time ( ct)@xcite version . in this approach",
    "the only essential approximation is the limitation to a finite cluster and the convergence of the results with @xmath0 can be checked systematically@xcite . in cases where the monte - carlo sign problem is not serious , these methods can provide very reliable results for the electron self - energy . in the last years , also calculations of two - particle vertex functions@xcite became possible .",
    "this technical progress has a very high impact , because two - particle vertex functions are a crucial ingredient for calculating@xcite momentum- and frequency - dependent response functions in dmft and dca , and also represent the building blocks for all multiscale extensions of dmft@xcite and dca,@xcite aiming at including spatial correlations on all length scales.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is , however , not to obtain new result for the self - energy with these novel schemes .",
    "in fact , at least within dmft and dca , the self - energy can be directly computed without the time consuming calculation of the two - particle vertices .",
    "our aims , here , are different : ( i ) to develop methods that improve our physical interpretation of the self - energy results in strongly correlated systems , and ( ii ) to understand how the correlated physics is actually captured by diagrammatic approaches beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "we do this by applying a parquet - based diagrammatic decomposition to the self - energy .",
    "specifically , we use the dmft and dca results for this parquet decomposition , thus avoiding _ any _ perturbative approximation for the vertex .",
    "we apply the method to the hubbard model on cubic ( three dimensional , @xmath1 ) and square ( two - dimensional , @xmath2 ) lattices . in these cases , quite a bit is already known about the physics , which , to some extent , allows for a check of our methodology .",
    "we recall briefly here , that in the parquet schemes two - particle diagrams are classified according to whether they are two - particle reducible ( 2pr ) in a certain channel , i.e. , whether a diagram can be split in two parts by only cutting two green s functions , or are fully irreducible at the two - particle level ( 2pi ) .",
    "diagrams reducible in a particular channel can then be related to specific physical processes .",
    "specifically , we obtain three classes of reducible diagrams , longitudinal ( @xmath3 ) and transverse ( @xmath4 ) particle - hole diagrams and particle - particle ( @xmath5 ) diagrams .",
    "because of the electronic spin , the particle - hole diagrams can be rearranged , more physically , in terms of spin ( magnetic ) and charge ( density ) contributions , while for @xmath5 the @xmath6 term ( essential for the singlet pairing ) will be explicitly kept .    in this work , we compute explicitly the parquet equations , bethe - salpeter equations and the equation of motion ( eom ) which relate the vertices in the different channels to each other and to the self - energy , by using the 2pr and 2pi vertices of the dmft and dca calculations .",
    "hence , apart from statistical errors , we get an `` exact '' diagrammatic expansion of the self - energy of our dmft ( @xmath7 ) or dca ( @xmath8 ) clusters .",
    "since , within the parquet formalism , the physical processes are automatically associated to the different scattering channels , our calculations can be exploited to extract an unbiased physical interpretation of our dmft and dca self - energies and to investigate the structure of the feynman diagrammatics beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "we note here that , from the merely conceptual point of view , the parquet decomposition is the most `` natural '' route to disentangle the physical information encoded in self - energies and correlated spectral functions .",
    "the parquet procedure can be compared , e.g. , to the recently introduced fluctuation diagnostics@xcite approach , which also aims at extracting the underlying physics of a given self - energy : in the fluctuation diagnostics the quantitative information about the role played by the different physical processes is extracted by studying the different representations ( e.g. , charge , spin , or particle - particle ) , in which the eom for the self - energy , and specifically the full two - particle scattering amplitude , can be written .",
    "hence , in this respect , the parquet decomposition provides a more direct procedure , because it does not require any further change of representation for the momentum , frequency , spin variables , and can be readily analyzed at once , provided that the vertex functions have been calculated in an channel - unbiased way .",
    "however , as we will discuss in this work , the parquet decomposition presents also disadvantages w.r.t .",
    "the fluctuation diagnostics , because ( i ) it requires working with 2pi vertices , which makes the procedure somewhat harder from a numerical point of view , and ( ii ) it faces intrinsic instabilities for increasing interaction values .    by applying this procedure to the 2d hubbard model at intermediate values of @xmath9 ( of the order of half the bandwidth ) ,",
    "we find large contributions from spin - fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with a common belief that @xmath10 spin fluctuations are very important for the physics , as well as with the fluctuation diagnostics results.@xcite for the 3d hubbard model similar physics was first proposed by berk - schrieffer.@xcite later spin fluctuations have been proposed to be important for the 2d hubbard model and similar models by many groups.@xcite we note , however , that the contributions of the other channels to the parquet decomposition are not small by themselves .",
    "rather , the other ( non - spin ) channel contributions to @xmath11 appear to play the role of `` screening '' the electronic scattering originated by the purely spin - processes .",
    "the latter would lead , otherwise , to a significant overestimation of the electronic scattering rate . at larger values of @xmath9",
    "the parquet decomposition starts displaying strong oscillation at low - frequencies in all its term , _ but _ the spin contribution .",
    "physically , this might be an indication that the spin fluctuations also predominate in the non - perturbative regime , where , however , the parquet distinction among the remaining ( secondary ) channels loses its physical meaning .",
    "the reason for this can be traced back to the occurrence of singularities in the generalized susceptibilities of these ( secondary ) channels .",
    "such singularities are reflected in the corresponding divergencies of the two - particle _ irreducible _ vertex functions , recently discovered in the dmft solution of the hubbard and falicov - kimball models@xcite .",
    "here we extend the study of their origin and generalize earlier results @xcite to dca .",
    "we discuss the relation of these singularities to the resonance valence bond rvb@xcite character of the ground - state , the pseudogap and the suppression of charge fluctuations for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "our results are relevant also beyond the specific problem of the physical interpretation of the self - energy .",
    "in fact , the parquet decomposition can be also used to develop new quantum many - body schemes . wherein some simple approximation might be introduced for the irreducible diagrams that are considered to be particularly fundamental .",
    "the parquet equations are then used to calculate the reducible diagrams . in our results , however , for strongly correlated systems the contribution to the self - energy from the irreducible diagrams diverges for certain values of @xmath9 both in dmft and dca .",
    "this makes the derivation of good approximations for these diagrams for strongly correlated systems rather challenging .",
    "it remains , however , an interesting question if the parquet decomposition can be modified in such a way that these problems are avoided .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following . in sec .",

    "[ fig:2.1 ] , and it can be interpreted , physically , as the scattering rate amplitude between two added / removed electrons . within the parquet formalism",
    "all diagrams contributing to @xmath26 are divided in two classes : either they can be split in two parts by cutting two internal green s function lines ( two particle reducibility : 2pr ) , or they can not ( two - particle irreducibility : 2pi ) .",
    "moreover , because we are considering two - particle processes , whose diagrams have ( altogether ) four external lines , a finer classification can be performed for the 2pr diagrams . as exemplified by the diagrams on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:2.1 ] , we can further distinguish among the cases , where , in the cutting - procedure , ( i ) lines 1 and 3 are separated from 2 and 4 , which corresponds to particle - particle ( @xmath5 ) reducibility , ( ii ) lines 1 and 2 are separated from 3 and 4 , i.e. , longitudinal particle - hole ( @xmath3 ) reducibility , and , eventually , ( iii ) lines 1 and 4 are separated from lines 2 and 3 , i.e. transverse particle - hole ( @xmath4 ) reducibility .",

    "[ fig:2.2 ] .",

    "this hamiltonian constitutes an important testbed case for applying the idea of a parquet decomposition , since eq .",

    "this choice corresponds to a rather strong correlation regime , as it is clearly seen even in a purely dmft context.@xcite in this work , however , we will also consider smaller values of @xmath9 , of the order of half bandwidth , corresponding to a regime of more moderate correlations .",
    "in this section we study the parquet decomposition of an electron self - energy computed by dmft and dca . in these non - perturbative methods a cluster with @xmath0 sites",

    "we start by applying the parquet decomposition to the easier case of the dmft self - energy . in particular",
    ", we will focus on one of the most studied cases in dmft , the half - filled hubbard model in @xmath1 , where dmft describes a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition at a finite @xmath61 .",
    "the specific parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard ] ) have been chosen in this case as follows : @xmath62 ( half - filling ) and @xmath63 ev@xmath64 .",
    "the results of the parquet decomposition of the dmft self - energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1 ] in the weak - to - intermediate coupling regime @xmath65 ev .",
    "the plots show the imaginary part of the dmft self - energy ( solid black line ) as a function of the matsubara frequencies i@xmath19 and for two different values of @xmath9 ( we recall that @xmath44 does not depend on momentum in dmft , and that in a particle - hole symmetric case , as the one we consider here , it does not have any real part beyond the constant hartree term ) .    by computing the dmft generalized local ( @xmath7 ) susceptibility of the associated impurity problem , and proceeding as described in the previous section",
    ", we could actually decompose i m @xmath66 into the four contributions from terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.9bis ] ) , depicted by different colors / symbols in the plots . before analyzing their specific behaviors , we note that their sum ( gray dashed line ) _ does _ reproduce precisely the value of i m @xmath44 directly computed in the dmft algorithm . since all the four terms of eq .",
    "[ eq:2.9bis ] are calculated independently from the parquet - decomposed equation of motion , this result represents indeed a stringent test of the numerical stability and the algorithmic correctness of our parquet decomposition procedure .",
    "given the number of steps involved in the algorithm , illustrated in the previous section , the fulfillment of such a self - consistency test is particularly significant , and , indeed , it has been verified for all the parquet decomposition calculations presented in this work .    by considering the most weak - coupling data first ( @xmath67ev , left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1 ] ) , we note that the 2pi contribution ( @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.9bis ] ) , plum - colored open squares in the figure ) lies almost on top of the `` exact '' dmft self - energy . at weak - coupling",
    "this is not particularly surprising , because @xmath69 , while all the 2pr contributions are at least @xmath70 .",
    "hence , when the 2pi vertex is inserted into the equation of motion , @xmath71 simply reduces to the usual second - order perturbative diagram . in this situation ( i.e. , i m @xmath72 )",
    ", it is interesting to observe that the other sub - leading contributions ( spin , particle - particle scattering and charge channel ) are not fully negligible .",
    "rather , they almost exactly compensate each other : the extra increase of the scattering rate [ i.e. : -im @xmath73 due to the spin - channel is compensated ( or `` screened '' ) almost perfectly by the charge- and the particle - particle channel .    not surprisingly , the validity of this cancellation is gradually lost by increasing @xmath9 . at @xmath74 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1 ] ) , which is still much lower than @xmath75 , one observes that the 2pi contribution no longer provides so accurate values for i m @xmath76 . at the same time , the contributions of all scattering channels increase : the low - frequency behavior of the spin channel now would provide -taken on its own- a scattering rate even larger than the true one of dmft . consistently , a correspondingly larger compensation of the charge and the particle - scattering channels contribution is observed . at higher frequency , these changes w.r.t . the previous case",
    "are mitigated , matching the intrinsic perturbative nature of the high - frequency / high - t expansions@xcite .",
    "the situation described above , which suggests an important role of spin fluctuations , partially screened by charge and particle - particle scattering processes , displays important changes at intermediate - to - strong coupling @xmath9 .",
    "this is well exemplified by the data reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.2 ] ( left panel ) . despite the dmft self - energy still displays a low - frequency metallic bending ( @xmath77 is on the metallic side of the dmft mit ) , in the low - frequency region one observes the appearance of a huge oscillatory behavior in the parquet decomposition of @xmath44 : all contributions to i m @xmath44 , _ but _ the spin term ( s. below ) , are way larger than the self - energy itself and fluctuate so strongly in frequency , that several changes of sign are observed .",
    "this makes it obviously very hard to define any kind of hierarchy for the impact of the corresponding scattering channels on the final self - energy result .",
    "hence , at these intermediate - to - strong values of @xmath9 the parquet decomposition procedure appears to be no longer able to fully disentangle the physics underlying a given ( here : dmft ) self - energy . at the same time",
    ", we should stress that the strong oscillations visible in the parquet decomposition of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.2 ] can _ not _ be ascribed to numerical accuracy issues .",
    "in fact , one observes , that , also in this problematic case , the self - consistency test works as well as for the other data sets : the total sum of such oscillating contributions , still reproduces the i m @xmath76 from dmft in the whole frequency range considered .",
    "the reason of such behavior has to be traced back , instead , to the divergencies of the 2pi vertices recently reported in dmft work.@xcite while the relation with such divergencies will be extensively discussed in sec .",
    "iv , it is worth stressing already here , that there is only one contribution to @xmath76 , which never displays wild oscillation , even for intermediate - to - strong @xmath9 : the spin channel .",
    "this means that even when the parquet decomposition displays a strong oscillatory behavior , a bethe - salpeter decomposition in this specific ( spin ) channel will always remain well - behaved and meaningful .",
    "this is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.2 ] ( right panel ) , where all the contributions to @xmath76 , but @xmath78 , ( i.e. , formally : all the contributions 2pi in the spin channel ) are summed together : here no oscillation is visible .",
    "the results of such bethe - salpeter decomposition of @xmath76 in the spin channel suggests then again an interpretation of a physics dominated by this scattering channel , though -this time- in the non - perturbative regime : strong ( local ) spin fluctuations , originated by the progressive formation of localized magnetic moments , are responsible for the major part of the electronic self - energy and scattering rate .",
    "their effect is , as before , partly reduced , or screened , by the scattering processes in the other channels ( opposite sign contribution to i m @xmath44 ) .",
    "differently as before , however , the specific role of the `` secondary '' channels can no longer be disentangled via our parquet decomposition .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the numerical results for the parquet decomposition of self - energy data computed in dca .",
    "different from dmft , the dca self - energy provides a more accurate description of finite dimensional systems , as it is also explicitly dependent on the momenta of the discretized brillouin zone ( i.e. , a cluster of @xmath0 patches in momentum space ) of the dca .",
    "we will present here parquet decomposition results for the self - energy of the two - dimensional hubbard model with hopping parameter @xmath53 for different values of the density @xmath79 and of the interaction @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we will mostly focus on the self - energy at the so called anti - nodal point , @xmath80 , because it usually displays the strongest correlation effects for this model and also because the vector @xmath80 is always present in both clusters we used ( @xmath81 ) in our dca calculation .",
    "we note , however , that the results of the parquet decomposition for the other relevant momenta of this system , i.e. the nodal one @xmath82 , ( for @xmath83 where it is available ) , are qualitatively similar .    as for the dmft case , we start by considering a couple of significant cases at fixed density ( here @xmath84 , corresponding to the typical @xmath85% of hole doping of the optimally doped high - t@xmath86 cuprates ) , and perform the parquet decomposition for different @xmath9 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.3 ] we show the calculations performed at a moderate @xmath87ev ( interaction equal to the semibandwidth ) . as",
    "one sees the results are qualitatively similar to the dmft one at intermediate coupling ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1 ] ) , which one could indeed interpret in terms of predominant spin - scattering processes , partially screened by the other channels .",
    "however , also in dca , extracting such information from the parquet decomposition becomes rather problematic for larger values of @xmath9 . at @xmath88",
    "ev ( interaction equal to the bandwidth : fig .",
    "[ fig:3.3 ] right panel ) , the parquet decomposition appears dominated by contributions from the 2pi and the @xmath5 channel : these become an order of magnitude larger than the spin - channel contribution and of the total dca self - energy .",
    "this finding , in turn , indicates the occurrence of large cancellation effects in the parquet - decomposed basis , making quite hard any further physical interpretation .",
    "it is also instructive to look at the effect of a change in the level of hole - doping on the parquet decomposition calculations .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.4 ] : in the left panel of the figure results for the highly doped case @xmath89 ( @xmath90% hole doping ) are shown . despite the large value of the interaction @xmath91 ev ,",
    "this parquet decomposition looks qualitatively similar to the one at moderate coupling of the less doped case fig .",
    "[ fig:3.3 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "conversely , at half - filling ( @xmath62 , right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.4 ] ) , although we chose a lower value of @xmath92 ev , the parquet decomposition displays the very same large oscillations among different channel contributions observed in the dmft data ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3.2 ] , left panel ) .",
    "hence , our parquet decomposition procedure applied to the dca results allows us to extend the considerations drawn from the dmft analysis of the previous section : for a large enough value of @xmath9 and moderate or no doping , the parquet decomposition of the self - energy becomes rather problematic , as some channel contributions ( supposed to be secondary ) become abruptly quite large , or even strongly oscillating , with large cancellation between different terms .",
    "the inclusion of non - local correlations within the dca allows us to demonstrate that this is _ not _ a special aspect of the peculiar , purely local , dmft physics , but it survives also in presence of non - local correlations . actually , as we will discuss in the next sections , the non - local correlations do _ favor _ the occurrence of singularities in the parquet decomposition , which is observed for dca in a correspondingly larger parameter region ( at lower @xmath9 and hole - doping ) than in dmft .    in this perspective",
    ", it is interesting to investigate , whether the singularities in the parquet decomposition , with their intrinsically non - perturbative nature , already occur in a parameter region where the dca self - energy displays a strong momentum differentiation , with pseudogap features . as discussed in ref .",
    ", such a case is achieved in a @xmath83 dca calculation for , e.g. , : @xmath93 ( @xmath94% hole doping ) , @xmath95 ev , @xmath96 ev@xmath97 ( with the additional inclusion of a realistic next - to - nearest hopping term @xmath98 ev ) . in the left panels of the fig .",
    "[ fig:3.5 ] the dca self - energy for the anti - nodal and the nodal momentum is shown , together with its corresponding parquet decomposition .",
    "we note , as it was also stated in ref .",
    ", that the positive ( i.e. , non fermi - liquid ) slope of im@xmath99 in the lowest frequency region for @xmath100 indicates a pseudogap spectral weight suppression at the antinode .",
    "the parquet decomposition of the two self - energies is , however , very similar : the strong oscillations of the various channels clearly demonstrate that in the parameter region where a pseudogap behavior is found in dca , the parquet decomposition displays already strong oscillations .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that , similarly as we discussed in the previous section , also in this case , the spin channel contribution of the parquet decomposition is the only one displaying a well - behaved shape , with values of the order of the self - energy and no frequency oscillations .",
    "consequently , also for the dca self - energy in the pseudogap regime , a bethe - salpeter decomposition in the spin - channel of the self - energy remains valid ( see right panel of fig .  [ fig:3.5 ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this might be interpreted as an hallmark of the predominance of the spin - scattering processes in a non - perturbative regime , where a well - behaved parquet decomposition is no longer possible . in this perspective , the physical interpretation would match very well the conclusions derived about the origin for the pseudogap self - energy of dca by means of the recently introduced fluctuation diagnostics method@xcite . at present , hence , the post processing of a given numerical self - energy provided by the fluctuation diagnostics procedure appear the most performant , because -differently from the parquet decomposition- it remains applicable , without any change , also to non - perturbative cases .",
    "after discussing our parquet decomposition calculations , their proposed physical interpretation , and their limitation in applicability , it is natural to wonder , where such limitations arise from .",
    "this analysis is , in fact , very important also _ beyond _ the calculations presented in this work , because the parquet equations represent the base - camp of several novel quantum many body schemes aiming at the the description of strongly correlated electron beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "as we anticipated before , the reason for the occurrence of strong low - frequency oscillations in the parquet decomposition can be traced to the _ divergence _ of the 2pi irreducible vertex functions observed by increasing @xmath9,@xcite or -equivalently- to the occurrence of _ singularities _ in the generalized @xmath3 charge ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath102 and/or singlet ) ( @xmath103 ) susceptibilities .",
    "the investigation of the exact relation between the peculiar behavior of the parquet decomposition by increasing @xmath9 and the singularities of the corresponding generalized susceptibility matrix will be explicitly addressed below .",
    "in this section , we aim at clarifying _ why _ some contributions of the parquet decomposition start displaying singularities and strong oscillatory behaviors upon increasing @xmath9 . from a general perspective , since the singularities observed in the previous section _ always _",
    "affect @xmath71 , the contribution stemming from the 2pi vertex , a clear relation must exist with corresponding divergencies of the 2pi vertices .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of divergences in the 2pi vertices of the hubbard and falicov - kimball model has been recently demonstrated by means of analytic and dmft calculations.@xcite in particular , we recall that such singularities show up simultaneously in the fully 2pi vertex @xmath29 as well as in the irreducible vertices @xmath104 in the charge ( @xmath105 ) and particle - particle channel(@xmath106 ) , while the full vertex @xmath26 and the self - energy remain always well - behaved",
    ". evidently , this perfectly matches the problematic channels of our parquet decompositions .    as discussed in ref .",

    "in fact , when an eigenvalue goes through zero , the irreducible vertex functions change qualitatively .",
    "in particular , one observes that second order perturbation theory breaks down , failing to reproduce even the sign of the vertex - functions at low frequencies . in this sense",
    "the system is then in the truly strong - coupling limit . in ref .",

    "when the frequency transfer @xmath18 is zero , we showed that the lowest eigenvalue of this matrix becomes negative as @xmath9 is increased .",

    ", we will analyze in more details such divergencies , by extending the previous dmft ( @xmath7 ) results@xcite to dca ( @xmath111 ) , and by investigating in details how singularities develop in the generalized susceptibility matrices and how they affect the parquet decompositions of the self - energy .      for the sake of clarity we start by analyzing the generalized charge susceptibility in the @xmath7 ( dmft ) case , focusing on the most - correlated case of half - filling . in particular we will mainly study the most singular case of @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , @xmath112 represents the largest contribution to the parquet decomposition for the values of @xmath113 studied here , and , thus , its behavior is particularly significant .",
    "the case @xmath114 , nonetheless , will be also discussed briefly afterwards .",
    "for a very small value of @xmath9 , where no problem in the parquet decomposition is observed , we can approximate the generalized charge susceptibility with the non interacting one , i.e. , with a product of two green s functions @xmath115 .",
    "in addition we can use noninteracting green s functions .",
    "the corresponding diagonal elements are given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the number of @xmath118-points and @xmath119 is the corresponding single - particle energy eigenvalue .",
    "off - diagonal elements will obviously appear at finite @xmath9 , remaining however much smaller than the diagonal ones in the perturbative regime .",
    "if we now consider the limit of very large @xmath19 , the diagonal elements behave as @xmath120 and , hence , also become very small . in the numerical calculations , we limit the range of @xmath121 to some maximum value @xmath122 . hence , in the perturbative regime",
    ", the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath101 will correspond roughly to the value of the diagonal element for @xmath123 , and its eigenvector will have weight for @xmath124 .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased , however , the off - diagonal elements @xmath125 become gradually more important until , at a certain point , ( e.g. , at @xmath126 ev for the temperature we considered ) this picture changes radically : the off - diagonal component of @xmath127 for small frequencies become comparable or larger than the corresponding diagonal ones . as a consequence ( see appendix [ app:2by2 ] ) , the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath127 crosses zero and , for large interaction , a negative eigenvalue appears .",
    "in contrast to the small @xmath9 case , the corresponding vector has most of its weight for @xmath128 : for these parameters the total weight of two elements for @xmath128 is about @xmath129 .",
    "this indicates that a crossing of energy levels has occurred between a lowest eigenvector having most of the weight at large frequencies to the one having most of the weight for small frequencies.@xcite    in this situation , the most significant piece of information can be extracted by restricting the analysis to the matrix elements for @xmath130 , i.e. , to a @xmath131 matrix in frequency space .",
    "then the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath101 is @xmath132 .",
    "it provides a good approximation after the level crossing has occurred , i.e. , where the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath101 has become negative .",

    "the diagonal element decreases and the off - diagonal element increases as @xmath9 is increased .",
    "approximately as they cross , the lowest eigenvalue goes negative ( the minor deviation of @xmath135u reflects the corresponding small difference between @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) .",
    "as the lowest eigenvalue @xmath137 of @xmath138 goes through zero , @xmath139 becomes infinite .",
    "for the cases we have studied , the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of the @xmath131 matrix have the same sign when this happens .",
    "consequently , for the corresponding ( singular ) eigenvector , the elements for @xmath128 then have opposite signs .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5.3 ] ) that the diagonal and off - diagonal parts , @xmath140 and @xmath141 also have opposite signs . inserting @xmath139 in the expression needed for the parquet decomposition",

    "however , as one can easily infer from the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig:5.1 ] ) , at larger values of @xmath9 , the sign of the diagonal matrix element changes , and then the ( now non - singular ) contributions add constructively .",
    "hence , when a second eigenvalue of @xmath138 crosses zero , no cancellation will occur and the singularity will show up in the corresponding terms of the parquet decomposition of @xmath66 .    in particular , from ref .",

    "in particular , table  [ table:5.1 ] shows some of these matrix elements for , e.g. , @xmath149 ev .",

    "the lowest eigenvalue of this matrix is defined as @xmath157 .",

    "similarly to the @xmath7 case the components of the eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue ( @xmath181 ) have different signs for @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "then , the eigenvector corresponding to the second lowest eigenvalue , which vanishes at a larger @xmath184 , will have the two component @xmath128 with the same sign .",
    "eventually , combining all the eigenvector signs , we obtain that the lowest eigenvalue is associated to an eigenvector with opposite sign components , while the second lowest is not .",
    "this evidently depends on the specific signs in table  [ table:5.1 ] .",
    "hence , similar to the @xmath7 case , also for @xmath111 , the singularities occurring in @xmath101 will be actually responsible for the blowing up of the parquet decomposition ( see appendix [ appendix ] ) , with the significant exception of the first one encountered from weak - coupling .",
    "if one considered also the generalized susceptibility in the particle - particle channel @xmath185 , we would find an analogous trend .",

    "the signs of the corresponding singular eigenvector components do not compensate , which yield to the strong low - frequency oscillations of the @xmath145 data , presented in the previous section .",
    "moreover , in the same parameter regime ( @xmath189 ) , also the singularities of the lowest real eigenvalue of @xmath101 for @xmath190 or for @xmath155 crossing zero do not cancel , leaving the spin channel as the _ only _ contribution of the parquet decomposition unaffected by singularities .    in summary , we find that the singularities in the generalized susceptibilities are actually reflected in a blowing up of the parquet decomposition in the corresponding channel(s ) . due to the possible occurrence of compensating signs in the frequency components of the singular eigenvector of @xmath25 , however , the correspondence is not complete .",
    "in fact , we find that the parquet decomposition remains well - behaved in _ all _ channels even beyond the value of @xmath9 , where the first singularity appears in the bethe - salpeter equation for the charge channel ( i.e. , at @xmath191 for @xmath192 ev@xmath64 in dca with @xmath111 ) , because of the compensating signs of the singular eigenvector . however , this is no longer the case for larger values of @xmath9 , where the singular parts of @xmath139 and/ or @xmath193 add up in the parquet decomposition of the self - energy , making a separate ( parquet ) treatment of the corresponding scattering channels quite problematic .",
    "more specifically , in this regime , the absolute contribution from the totally irreducible diagrams to the self - energy at low - frequencies tends to be very large , and to a substantial extent , to be canceled by a very large particle - particle contribution . beyond this",
    "compensations , it is also interesting to note that in fig .  [ fig:3.3 ] a sign - crossing is observed between the anomalous low frequency contributions of the irreducible and the @xmath5 channel to the self - energy and their more conventionally behaved counter - parts at high - frequency . hence , since the high - frequency behavior of the self - energy can be related to the lowest order perturbation theory , the sign crossings of the @xmath5 and fully irreducible contribution at intermediate frequency represent an evident manifestation of the break - down of the perturbative description .    in order to go beyond this mostly formal interpretation of the singularities in the generalized susceptibilities ( and of their effects on the parquet decomposition ) , in the next subsection we will improve our understanding of the underlying physics by a comparison with simplified model cases , where such singularities also appear .",
    "to improve our physical insight on the occurrence of the singularities , we start by considering one of the most basic case , where they appear , i.e. , a simple two - level ( impurity ) model : this model has a coulomb interaction @xmath9 on the ( @xmath7 ) cluster site and no interaction on the bath site @xmath194 and an intersite hopping @xmath195 .",

    "we have calculated the two - particle vertex function in dmft and dca for the hubbard model .",
    "the vertex function was then exploited to perform a parquet decomposition of the dca self - energy .",
    "the purpose of such decomposition was similar as for the recently introduced fluctuation diagnostic approach,@xcite i.e. , to improve our understanding of the physical origin of the numerical results for the self - energy . in comparison to the latter approach , the parquet decomposition allows -in",
    "principle- for a more direct formulation , which does not require any representation change in the equation of motion for the self - energy .",
    "however , as we discussed in this work , as opposed to the fluctuation diagnostics procedure , its usage poses also important new challenges .    while the parquet decomposition works relatively smoothly in the perturbative regime and allows one to evaluate quantitatively the role played by the different channels , for larger values of @xmath9 and moderate doping ,",
    "some of its terms start to display very large oscillations at small frequencies .",
    "this renders it impossible to disentangle the role of the channels affected by such oscillations .",
    "we should note , however , that in all cases considered we could always find , even at strong coupling , at least _",
    "one _ well - behaved term in the parquet decomposition ( which was the spin contribution , @xmath78 , for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 hubbard model close to / at half - filling ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as a specific indication emerging from the parquet decomposition of a predominance of that well - behave channel .",
    "in this way the predictions of the parquet decomposition of @xmath44 provide a qualitatively similar outcome@xcite to those of the fluctuation diagnostics . unlike the former , the latter approach , appears not to be affected at all by entering in non - perturbative regime .    beyond the physical insight in the self - energy , our results are also relevant for the future developments of forefront methods in quantum many body physics .",
    "in fact , several recently proposed computational schemes have been based on the parquet decomposition , introducing approximations for the totally irreducible diagrams , and then calculating the reducible diagrams via the parquet equations.@xcite the results above , however , show that the contribution from the irreducible diagrams becomes highly complicated for strongly correlated systems , even diverging for certain values of @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests that all schemes based on the parquet decomposition above might encounter unforeseen problems in the intermediate - to - strong correlated regime .",
    "however , we should recall that the generalized susceptibilities in matsubara space are not directly measurable quantities .",
    "hence , one may wonder , whether alternatives to the conventional parquet decomposition for classifying the feynman diagrams could be found , in order to improve the description of electronic correlations in the intermediate coupling regimes and avoid the singularities .",
    "in the specific context of our dmft and dca analysis , we have demonstrated that the singularities of some terms of the parquet decomposition of the self - energy is directly related to the divergencies of @xmath139 and @xmath193 at intermediate @xmath9 values . in particular",
    ", we showed that the divergence of @xmath139 is related to the suppression of charge fluctuations .",
    "this represents an early , non - perturbative , manifestation of the mott - hubbard physics .",
    "the relation of such singularities to a rvb state and to the formation of a pseudogap has also been investigated for the case of the @xmath111 dca clusters , making progress towards a theoretical understanding of the highly non - trivial physics of strong electron correlations in two - dimensions .",

    "[ sec:4 ] and the corresponding evolution of the singular eigenvalue of @xmath238 .",
    "specifically , in order to analyze the role played by the lowest eigenvalue of the generalized susceptibility , we express the inverse of @xmath238 in the basis of the eigenvalues ( @xmath229 ) and the eigenvectors ( @xmath230 ) of @xmath238 : @xmath239 an approximate expression , @xmath240 , can then be obtained by restricting the sum to the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath238 .",
    "we now illustrate the usefulness of the representation eq .",
    "[ eq:5.3 ] by applying it first to the case of dmft ( @xmath7 ) . in fig .",

    "the contribution for @xmath128 is approximately zero , because the corresponding ( weak - coupling ) eigenvector has almost no weight for these frequencies .",
    "@xmath237 becomes large already for @xmath9 slightly smaller than @xmath242 , where the approximate eigenvalue is small but positive . here",
    ", a low - lying `` resonance '' gives a large contribution .",
    "when the resonance goes through zero and becomes a `` bound state '' ( negative eigenvalue ) for the matrix of the generalized susceptibility , the sign of @xmath237 ( and hence also that of @xmath243 ) changes . for @xmath244 , @xmath240 provides a quite good approximation of @xmath237 , showing that the large values of @xmath237 are mainly due to this `` bound - state '' .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased further , the lowest eigenvalue gets more negative , and the matrix elements of @xmath237 are reduced .",
    "the basic character of @xmath238 , however , remains qualitatively different compared with smaller values of @xmath9 .",
    "this analysis can also be extended to the case of dca .",

    "[ sec:4 ] for the corresponding definitions ) .",
    "this leads to a large contribution to @xmath237 for @xmath9 close to 1.05 .",

    "( [ eq:5.3 ] ) ] . at the same time",
    "@xmath240 becomes a rather good approximation to @xmath237 .",
    "increasing @xmath9 further , a second resonance forms , as is also seen by the small value of the second lowest eigenvalue in the @xmath248 space .",
    "this leads to very large values of @xmath237 for @xmath249 , which are missed by @xmath240 . for @xmath250 this resonance",
    "is converted to a negative eigenvalue , signs of matrix elements of @xmath237 change , and @xmath240 again becomes a good approximation of @xmath237 .",
    "the following generic matrix is related to the discussion in the main text :            when the first eigenvalue vanishes ( @xmath258 ) the first term of the matrix @xmath259 diverges , while the sum over all its matrix elements stays finite , because the sum over the matrix elements in the first term exactly vanishes due to the antisymmetry of the corresponding eigenvector .",
