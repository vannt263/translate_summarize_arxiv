    "in spite of the quantitative success of the standard model , the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking remains unclear .",
    "only a few years ago , bosonic technicolor models provided a relatively unconventional approach to solving this problem  @xcite : electroweak symmetry was broken dynamically by a fermion condensate triggered by new strong forces , while a fundamental scalar field was responsible for transmitting these effects to the fermions through ordinary yukawa couplings .",
    "these models did not require a conventional extended technicolor sector , and hence were freed from the associated flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problems .",
    "unfortunately , precision electroweak constraints rule out bosonic technicolor models at least in models where the strong dynamics is qcd - like and the s - parameter can be reliably estimated  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we point out that a very similar scenario , bosonic topcolor , also provides a very simple low - energy effective theory , but one that is not in conflict with electroweak constraints . in this scenario , electroweak symmetry is partly broken by new strong dynamics that affects fields of the third generation , as in conventional topcolor scenarios  @xcite , while a weakly - coupled scalar doublet transmits the symmetry breaking to the fermions via yukawa couplings .",
    "since this scenario involves both a fundamental ( @xmath2 ) and a composite ( @xmath3 ) higgs field that both contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking , the usual problematic relation  @xcite between the dynamical top quark mass and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is not obtained .",
    "the result is a viable two higgs doublet model of type iii , which we will show survives the bounds from flavor changing neutral current processes and may provide interesting flavor - changing signals as well .",
    "the possibility of topcolor models involving fundamental scalars has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers , however , the fundamental higgs field was strongly coupled , and the authors considered whether the fundamental field itself could trigger the formation of a @xmath4 condensate . here",
    "we introduce @xmath2 as a weakly - coupled field and investigate the phenomenological consequences .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a philosophical objection to the original bosonic technicolor scenarios , and the bosonic topcolor models described here , is that strong dynamics was originally intended to eliminate the need for a fundamental higgs field altogether , as well as the associated problem with quadratic divergences .",
    "recent theoretical developments relating to the possibility of low - scale quantum gravity  @xcite renders these objections hollow : the presence of a low string scale eliminates the conventional desert so that nonsupersymmetric low - energy theories with fundamental scalars are not unnatural .",
    "moreover , in this setting there are new origins for the strong dynamics , namely the exchange of a nonperturbatively large number of gluon kaluza - klein excitations  @xcite .",
    "while we will not consider an explicit extra - dimensional embedding of the scenario described here , it seems that these considerations make the investigation of models with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and fundamental scalar fields well motivated .    in the next section",
    "we will present a simple realization of the bosonic topcolor idea following the nambu - jona - lasinio approach  @xcite .",
    "our first model is non - generic in the sense that we do not specify the most general set of higher - dimension operators that could appear in an arbitrary high - energy theory .",
    "however , it does provide a very convenient framework for parameterizing and exploring the basic phenomenological features of the scenario . after considering the phenomenological bounds",
    ", we will describe how to study the same type of scenario in a more general effective field theory approach . while we will not consider every phenomenological detail in this letter , we hope to obtain an accurate overall picture of the allowed parameter space .",
    "finally , we will discuss flavor changing signals for the model , notably a potential contribution to @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing that can be as large as the current experimental bound .",
    "we then summarize our conclusions .",
    "our high - energy theory is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 the field @xmath2 is a fundamental scalar doublet , and @xmath8 characterizes the scale at which new physics is present that generates the nonrenormalizable interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : njl ] ) . in light of our introductory remarks",
    ", we will assume henceforth that @xmath9  tev .",
    "in this minimal scenario we assume that the right - handed top , and left - handed top - bottom doublet @xmath10 experience the new strong interactions . immediately beneath the scale @xmath8",
    "we may rewrite eqs .",

    ", @xmath12 and one recovers eqs .",

    "@xmath14 , quantum corrections induce a kinetic term for @xmath3 , so that it becomes a dynamical field , a composite higgs doublet in the low - energy theory . in order to study the quantum corrections to eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) it is convenient for us to define the column vector @xmath15 then the kinetic term at the scale @xmath16 may be written @xmath17 , with @xmath18 in general , @xmath19 must be diagonalized and rescaled so that the kinetic terms assume the canonical form . however , in most of the parameter space that we consider later in this paper @xmath20 is small enough that the off - diagonal elements of @xmath19 are numerically irrelevant ; thus we use the simpler approximate form parameterized by @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) .",
    "properly normalized kinetic terms are then obtained via the substitution @xmath22 .",
    "quantum corrections also induce quartic self interactions , and mixing in the @xmath23 mass matrix .",
    "we retain the largest self - coupling , @xmath24 with coefficient @xmath25 ; the @xmath23 mass matrix is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",

    "( [ lagrangian ] ) can be fine - tuned against these radiative corrections ( as in the standard model ) so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are well beneath the cutoff scale @xmath8 . on the other hand",
    ", there is no tree - level @xmath31 mass mixing term given the way we defined our high - energy theory in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h])-([eq : njl ] ) . however , since we are considering the situation where the scale @xmath8 is relatively low ( @xmath32  tev ) and where the coupling @xmath20 is small ( see figs .  1 and 2 )",
    ", the off - diagonal elements will also be much smaller than the cut off .",
    "for the case where such tree - level mass mixing is present at the scale @xmath8 , the reader should refer to section  3 .",
    "electroweak symmetry will be broken in this model if @xmath3 and/or @xmath2 acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "there are several ways this can happen depending on the values of the different parameters in the model .",
    "we are principally interested in the case where @xmath33 , so that electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the strong dynamics and the vev of @xmath2 can be interpreted as a subsidiary effect .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study the scalar potential , @xmath34 rather than search directly for minima in a five - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) we extremize the potential and solve for @xmath40 and @xmath41 in terms of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 vevs .",
    "it is much more manageable to study the remaining constrained three - dimensional parameter space and determine which points correspond to stable local minima .",

    "since we focus on small values of @xmath20 in this letter , the top quark mass is mostly dynamical , originating from the first term in eq .",
