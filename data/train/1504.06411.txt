    "the general treatment that concerns how the driving forces affect the nature of phase transitions has not been established yet . to identify and classify various types of phase transitions peculiar to out of equilibrium systems",
    "can give valuable insights for developing non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "this peculiar type of phase transition has attracted considerable research attention .",
    "however , the possibility that a driving force causes the kt transition has not been clearly discussed or established .",
    "consequently , the question arises as to whether there is a system that does not exhibit the kt transition in equilibrium , while it does exhibit the transition in the presence of a driving force . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such a system has not been reported thus far . in this paper , we consider three - dimensional o(@xmath0 ) spin models driven with a uniform velocity over a random field as examples of such systems .",
    "this `` non - equilibrium kt transition '' may define a novel type of universality class , wherein the interplay between disorder and driving plays a crucial role .",
    "the dynamics of an ordered system driven by an external force over a random substrate have been a topic of intensive research in statistical physics . a rich variety of complex phenomena results from the interplay between elasticity , quenched disorder and driving .",

    "while the vortex lattice systems that exhibit the first - order phase transition in the absence of the disorder are well studied , very few studies have focused on a driven system over a random substrate that exhibits a second - order phase transition in the absence of disorder .    in this paper , we consider the nature of the dynamical reordering transition of three - dimensional o(@xmath0 ) spin models when they are driven with a uniform velocity over a random field .",

    "<S> we investigate three - dimensional o(@xmath0 ) spin models driven with a uniform velocity over a random field . within a spin - wave approximation </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that in the strong driving regime the model with @xmath1 exhibits a quasi - long - range order in which the spatial correlation function decays in a power - law form . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the cases that @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we numerically demonstrate a non - equilibrium phase transition between the quasi - long - range order phase and the disordered phase , which turns out to resemble the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the two - dimensional pure xy model in equilibrium . </S>"
