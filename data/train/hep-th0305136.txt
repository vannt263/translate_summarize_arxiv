    "topological landau - ginzburg models are an important class of 2d topological field theories ( 2d tfts ) . when coupled to topological gravity , they give soluble examples of noncritical string backgrounds .",
    "they are also closely related to topological sigma - models describing superstring propagation in calabi - yau manifolds ( the so - called cy / lg correspondence ) .    c.  vafa showed how to compute topological correlators in landau - ginzburg ( lg ) models on riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the answer is given by a simple closed formula .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize the results of ref .",

    ", they have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to get a simple formula for topological correlators ,",
    "one first needs a simple description of topological d - branes .",
    "recently such a description was proposed by m.  kontsevich ( unpublished ) . according to this proposal , topological d - branes are cdg modules over a certain cdg algebra which depends on the superpotential @xmath0 of the landau - ginzburg model .",
    "spaces of open strings stretched between d - branes are identified with the space of morphisms in the derived category of cdg modules .",
    "the ope algebra of boundary operators is encoded in the composition law of morphisms .",
    "it should be noted that the language of derived categories is very suited to the discussion of topological d - branes and has been used in the context of open string field theory ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we have given a physical derivation of kontsevich s conjecture .",
    "we also performed some explicit computations in the case when the lg model is massive .",
    "the derivation is reviewed in section  [ cdg ] below , with some improvements in exposition .",
    "the main physical idea is to represent topological d - branes as bound states of branes and anti - branes of maximal dimension .",
    "kontsevich s conjecture concerning the boundary ope follows from the analysis of the world - sheet action for the lg model with boundaries in the presence of both branes and anti - branes .",
    "> from the physical viewpoint , computing the boundary ope is only part of the problem .",
    "one would also like to know the topological metric on the space of open strings . together with the boundary ope ,",
    "this provides complete information about topological boundary correlators on a disk .",
    "more generally , one may consider disk correlators involving both bulk and boundary insertions .",
    "even more generally , one may consider correlators on a riemann surface with arbitrary number of boundaries and handles , and arbitrary insertions of bulk and boundary operators . in this paper",

    "> from the mathematical viewpoint , an interesting result of this paper is a simple explicit formula for the topological open - string metric , i.e. for a non - degenerate pairing between vector spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary b - branes ( i.e. cdg modules ) , and @xmath1 is the space of morphisms from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in the derived category of cdg modules .",
    "the non - degeneracy of the pairing follows from the properties of the path integral defining topological lg models , or equivalently , from the axioms of 2d tft with boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the pairing is natural , in an obvious sense . in particular , the algebra of endomorphisms of any b - brane is naturally a graded frobenius algebra .",
    "unlike in the closed - string case , this algebra is not supercommutative , in general .    to appreciate better the significance of the open - string metric , recall that in the case of b - branes on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath5 this metric is given by the usual pairing between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are objects of the bounded derived category of @xmath5 .",
    "the pairing is non - degenerate as a consequence of the serre duality theorem . on a general compact complex manifold serre duality",
    "tells us that there is a non - degenerate pairing between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the canonical line bundle .",
    "guided by this example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of a serre functor on a triangulated category .",
    "basically , a serre functor @xmath10 on a triangulated category @xmath11 is an autoequivalence of @xmath11 such that there exists a natural non - degenerate pairing between @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "a serre functor on @xmath11 , if it exists , is unique . using this terminology",
    ", one can say that all categories of topological branes have a trivial serre functor .",
    "this is interesting , because such categories are hard to come by .",
    "for example , the category of b - branes in a landau - ginzburg model must have a trivial serre functor , and our result for the open - string metric gives an explicit formula for the corresponding pairing .",
    "the non - degeneracy of this pairing is far from obvious , and it would be interesting to find a direct mathematical proof of this fact .",
    "in this section we review the physical derivation of the boundary ope algebra in the topologically twisted lg model .",
    "let @xmath13 , and @xmath0 be a holomorphic function on @xmath5 ( the superpotential ) .",
    "the worldsheet bulk lagrangian density is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath14 for definiteness , we have chosen the standard flat kahler metric on @xmath5 .",
    "if the worldsheet @xmath15 has no boundary , the action is invariant up to a total derivative under the @xmath16 worldsheet supersymmetry .",
    "what will be important to us is the type - b @xmath17 susy transformation @xmath18 our conventions are the same as in ref .",
    "the presence of worldsheet boundaries breaks @xmath17 susy in general .",
    "for instance , a brane wrapped on the whole target space @xmath5 is well known to be non - supersymmetric .",
    "however it is not unreasonable to expect that all supersymmetric d - branes ( in our case , b - branes ) can be obtained by the process of tachyon condensation on top - dimensional brane - anti - brane systems .",
    "in fact this is the basic assumption that we will make in this paper . as we shall see , the requirement of type - b @xmath17 susy invariance after tachyon condensation naturally gives rise to the mathematical structure of boundary ope algebra mentioned above .",
    "more specifically , we want to add a boundary term to the action for the tachyon and gauge fields associated with a brane - anti - brane system which wrap the whole space @xmath5 , such that the type - b supersymmetry can be restored .",
    "to this end , we first modify the bulk lagrangian density by a total derivative @xmath19 this does not change the physics in the bulk , although it makes easier to write down the boundary action . taking the standard neumann boundary conditions for all bulk fields , the modified bulk action , @xmath20 , has the following variation under type - b susy : @xmath21 on the other hand",
    ", the modified bulk action is invariant under an @xmath22 subalgebra : @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the boundary term we should add to recover @xmath17 invariance must be @xmath22-supersymmetric by itself .",
    "let the brane - anti - brane system be described by a pair of hermitian vector bundles @xmath24 with unitary connections .",
    "we may regard @xmath25 as a @xmath26-graded vector bundle . since @xmath13 , these bundles are necessarily trivial . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath27 and @xmath28 have rank one .",
    "the generalization to higher rank is discussed below .",
    "the boundary degrees of freedom are described by a boundary fermion @xmath29 , which is taken to be a section of @xmath30 .",
    "this field couples to a boundary tachyon @xmath31 , which is a section of the bundle @xmath32 , and the gauge field @xmath3 which is a connection on the line bundle @xmath30 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath3 is the difference of gauge fields on the brane and the anti - brane .",
    "the boundary action also depends on the sum of the two gauge fields , which we denote @xmath33 .",
    "the field @xmath33 is a connection on the line bundle @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath22-supersymmetric boundary action has the standard form @xcite @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are superfield completions : @xmath39 expressing in terms of components after integrating out the massive field @xmath40 , one gets @xmath41 \\label{eq : sb}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the covariant derivative associated with the connection @xmath3 , @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 is defined similarly , but with @xmath46 replaced with @xmath47 .",
    "now we require that the total action @xmath48 preserves the type - b @xmath17 supersymmetry .",
    "the variations of @xmath31 and @xmath3 are determined by variations of the bulk fields @xmath49 .",
    "the only field whose @xmath17 variation is not known is the boundary fermion @xmath29 .",
    "however we know that its variation can not involve @xmath50 since such a term destroys @xmath17 invariance .",
    "gauge invariance then dictates the following general form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an unknown function , and @xmath53 are a pair of sections on @xmath30 which do not depend on @xmath29 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath17 invariance implies @xmath54 , which in turn is satisfied if and only if @xmath55 in other words , @xmath17 invariance requires that the connection @xmath3 defines a holomorphic structure on the line bundle @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , @xmath17 invariance requires that the curvature of @xmath33 be of type @xmath56 .",
    "thus both @xmath27 and @xmath28 must be holomorphic line bundles .    to have @xmath17 invariance one must further demand that all @xmath29-dependent ( resp .",
    "@xmath57-dependent ) terms in @xmath58 cancel each other .",
    "it can be shown that this amounts to two conditions on @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "first , they must be purely bosonic , i.e. they depend only on @xmath61 and not on @xmath62 .",
    "second , they must satisfy the following equations @xmath63 these two equations have covariant solutions if and only if @xmath31 takes the following form @xmath64 together with the identification @xmath65 one can also show that these conditions are sufficient for cancellation of @xmath29-dependent and @xmath50-dependent terms in @xmath58 .",
    "the final requirement of @xmath66 invariance comes from demanding that the remaining terms in @xmath58 , which now do not involve @xmath29 at all , exactly cancel the bulk variation @xmath67 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the variation of @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 which cancels the bulk variation if and only if @xmath70    if the bundles @xmath27 and @xmath28 have rank higher than one , there is an additional complication .",
    "namely , the integrand in the string path integral is no longer an exponential of a local action : there is also a non - local factor @xmath71 where dots denote terms depending on the fermions and the boundary tachyon . in order to figure out the conditions imposed by @xmath17 susy",
    ", it is desirable to have a local action .",
    "this can be achieved by representing the path - ordered exponential by a path - integral over auxiliary degrees of freedom living on the boundary of the worldsheet .",
    "in fact , there are several way to do this ; for example , the boundary degrees of freedom can be bosonic or fermionic .",
    "the action for all these fields , and their transformation properties under @xmath17 susy will be described elsewhere .",
    "the results are the following .",
    "first of all , both @xmath27 and @xmath28 must be holomorphic vector bundles .",
    "second , the boundary tachyon , which is still a section of @xmath32 , must have the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a holomorphic section of @xmath32 , and @xmath74 is a holomorphic section of @xmath30 .",
    "finally , @xmath73 and @xmath74 must satisfy @xmath75 this implies , among other things , that @xmath27 and @xmath28 must have the same rank .    in the b - twisted model , the anti - holomorphic fermions @xmath76 and @xmath77 become 0-forms on the world - sheet , while the holomorphic components @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 combine into a 1-form @xmath80 .",
    "the brst transformation is obtained from type - b @xmath66 variation by setting @xmath81 .",
    "the brst charge @xmath82 is the sum of the bulk and boundary contributions .",
    "the bulk contribution is standard .",
    "the boundary part @xmath83 must generate the correct transformation @xmath84 because the connection defines a holomorphic structure on @xmath32 , one can locally trivialize the connection to @xmath85 . since @xmath5 is affine , one can actually take @xmath86 globally .",
    "the boundary brst charge in this gauge is given by @xmath87 since @xmath86 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are simply holomorphic matrix - valued functions of @xmath49 .",
    "one may check explicitly that the brst invariance is restored after adding the boundary contribution .",
    "the bulk brst charge is known to be given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "the bulk charge is not nilpotent but satisfies @xmath90 the total brst charge squares to zero by virtue of @xmath91 , as well as @xmath92 , which comes from the fact that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are holomorphic .",
    "physical states in the topological theory must be annihilated by the total brst charge .",
    "since we are working with a topological theory , the zero - mode approximation is adequate .",
    "the zero - mode hilbert space consists of sections of @xmath93 .",
    "the operators @xmath29 and @xmath57 are realized by the block matrices @xmath94 the boundary part of the brst operator is therefore identified with @xmath95 while the bulk part reduces to the standard dolbeault operator @xmath96 a section @xmath61 of @xmath93 is brst - invariant with the bulk fields @xmath49 . ] if and only if @xmath61 is holomorphic and super - commutes with @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath61 is a super - commutator of @xmath83 and a holomorphic section @xmath97 , then it is brst trivial .",

    "cdg algebras appear when we replace flat connections with arbitrary connections . in this example",
    "@xmath4 is simply the curvature 2-form of the connection .",
    "this is the origin of the term `` cdg algebra '' ( cdg means `` curved differential graded '' ) .",

    "second , if the algebra @xmath3 is super - commutative , then the pair @xmath117 is a dg - algebra , but dg modules over this dg - algebra are not the same as cdg - modules over the cdg - algebra @xmath104 , unless @xmath113 . indeed , in the former case we have the condition @xmath118 , while in the latter case we have @xmath119 .",
    "third , if @xmath120 , but @xmath115 , then @xmath110 is simply an odd endomorphism of the module @xmath109 ( i.e. @xmath121 for all @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) satisfying @xmath124 .",

    "it is given by @xmath146,\\ ] ] where the brackets denote the supercommutator .",
    "note that @xmath147 because of the super - jacobi identity and the fact that @xmath148 to summarize , if @xmath109 is a cdg module , then @xmath131 is a dg algebra .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case @xmath149 , @xmath150 , this dg algebra is precisely the algebra of boundary operators in the zero - mode approximation .",
    "the differential @xmath101 is identified with the boundary part of the brst operator .",
    "thus the space of physical states is simply the cohomology of @xmath101 , and the boundary ope structure is simply the algebra structure on the cohomology of @xmath101 .",
    "one can easily generalize this to the case when strings begin on one brane and end on another one . in this case",
    "we have a pair of cdg modules @xmath109 and @xmath151 , and the space of morphisms between them is a graded vector space @xmath152 equipped with a differential @xmath101 defined as follows : @xmath153 this vector space is identified with the space of operators which change the boundary conditions ( in the zero - mode approximation ) .",
    "the cohomology corresponding to the differential @xmath101 is identified with the brst cohomology ( i.e. the space of physical boundary changing operators modulo brst trivial ones ) .",
    "if we have three different branes , say , @xmath154 , and @xmath9 , we can compose morphisms from @xmath109 to @xmath151 and from @xmath151 to @xmath9 to obtain morphisms from @xmath109 to @xmath9 .",
    "this composition descends to the cohomology of @xmath101 , as one can easily see , and corresponds to composition of boundary - changing operators .",

    "consider also a category whose objects are free cdg modules over @xmath149 , whose morphisms are cohomology classes of the differential @xmath101 , and where composition is the obvious one .",
    "the above discussion can be restated by saying that these two categories are equivalent .",
    "the second category coincides with the derived category of cdg modules over the cdg algebra @xmath155 .",

    "the main physical assumption in the derivation is that any b - brane can be obtained as a bound state of branes and anti - branes of maximal dimension ( d - branes wrapping the whole target space ) .",
    "> from the mathematical point of view , there is the following subtlety : the derived category is not simply a category , but has some extra structure ( the shift functor and the so - called distinguished triangles ) . this structure makes the derived category into a triangulated category .",
    "ideally , one would like to show that triangulated structures also agree .",
    "one can easily see that the shift functor on the derived category corresponds to the functor on the b - brane category which exchanges branes and anti - branes , i.e. exchanges @xmath73 and @xmath74 in eq .",

    "such compactification are described by landau - ginzburg orbifolds ( gepner models ) , and one could hope that the methods of this paper could be used to determine the _ exact _ superpotential for both open and closed - sector moduli . to achieve this goal , one must generalize the formalism to orbifolds . let us sketch how this could be done .",
    "suppose that a finite group @xmath300 acts on @xmath99 while preserving both the complex structure and the superpotential @xmath0 .",
