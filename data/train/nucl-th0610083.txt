    "the study of particle abundances has been a major source of information concerning heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in fact , the agreement of the particle ratios with simple predictions of statistical models is a key argument for early thermalization of the formed system @xcite . up to now",
    "the numerous studies of the particle ratios koch:1985hk , cleymans:1992zc , sollfrank:1993wn , braun - munzinger:1994xr , braun - munzinger:1995bp , gazdzicki:1998vd , yen:1998pa , cleymans:1998fq , becattini:2000jw , rafelski:2000by , braun - munzinger:2001ip , michalec:2001um , magestro:2001jz , becattini:2003wp , braun - munzinger:2003zd , torrieri:2003nh , cleymans:2004pp , rafelski:2004dp , becattini:2005pt were falling into two basic categories : the so - called @xmath6 studies at low energies ( sis , ags ) and the studies at mid - rapidity for approximately boost - invariant systems at highest energies ( rhic ) .",
    "the @xmath6 studies involve three - momentum integrals of the statistical distribution functions , with the multiplicity of species @xmath7 given by @xmath8 , thus providing information on volume - averaged thermal parameters of the system in a very simple way .",
    "the inclusion of resonance decays brown:1991en , sollfrank:1990qz , bolz:1992hc , crucial for the success of the approach , is also straightforward , since the detection of the products with full angular coverage is insensitive to the decay kinematics or flow effects ; once the resonance has decayed , its products are registered . the other simple situation arises when the system is nearly boost - invariant . to a sufficiently good accuracy",
    "this is the case at mid - rapidity for the rhic energies , where the particle yields @xmath9 change only by a few percent in the rapidity window @xmath10 .",
    "the assumption of the boost - invariance of the fireball leads again to very simple formulas .",
    "although the particles detected at mid - rapidity are collected from various parts of the fireball , not only from the very central region , their ratios are the same as in the @xmath6 calculation .",
    "this is because for @xmath11 we have from the boost invariance @xcite @xmath12 this obvious general formula finds an explicit manifestation in specific boost - invariant models .",
    "the result also holds when resonance decays are included , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a derivation in the framework of the cooper - frye @xcite formalism .",
    "( transverse coordinate @xmath13 ) .",
    "particles emitted with the same value of pseudorapidity @xmath14 originate from different regions of the fireball indicated by the gray blobs ( they also are emitted at different times ) . the thermal conditions and flow ( indicated by arrows ) in these regions",
    "are different .",
    "the solid lines indicate tracks of primordial particles , while the dashed lines show products of resonance decays .",
    "the dashed ellipse indicates the relevant region for a give @xmath14 , which spans about two units of the spatial rapidity @xmath0 . ]",
    "when the system is not boost invariant the above simplifications no longer hold .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fireball ] .",
    "particles detected at a given pseudorapidity @xmath14 ( parallel lines in the figure ) originate from different pieces of the fireball ( gray blobs ) .",
    "thermal conditions ( temperature , chemical potentials , flow ) change from piece to piece , which must be properly included .",
    "in addition , the effects of the longitudinal flow ( indicated by arrows ) must be incorporated , and the kinematics of resonance decays ( dashed lines ) becomes relevant .",
    "although the resulting formalism for particle spectra remains conceptually simple and is based on the standard cooper - frye treatment , the calculation is no longer semi - analytic and a full - fledged simulation is necessary to accomplish the goal .    in the analysis of this paper we use therminator  the thermal heavy ion generator @xcite , to generate the monte carlo events in a suitably modified single - freeze - out model of ref .",
    "the extension to the boost - non - invariant case consists of two basic elements .",
    "the first one ( geometric ) is the choice of the shape of the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath15 and collective expansion .",
    "the other one incorporates the dependence of the thermal parameters on the position within the hypersurface @xmath15 .",
    "specifically , in our treatment the transverse size and the chemical potentials depend on the spatial rapidity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the longitudinal and time coordinates on the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "although the boost - non - invariant model has quite a few parameters , as listed at the end of sect .",
    "[ model ] , they can be fitted independently to various combinations of the data , leaving little freedom .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 dependence of the baryon and strange chemical potentials is fixed with the ratios of protons to antiprotons and @xmath19 to @xmath20 . the result in the range of the brahms data",
    "is the expected growth of the baryon and strange chemical potentials with @xmath21 .",
    "the value of the baryon chemical potential @xmath22 at @xmath2 , which is the relevant region for particles detected at the brahms forward rapidity , @xmath3 , is about @xmath4 .",
    "this value is in the range of the values of the thermal fits for the highest sps energy , thus we confirm the recent findings by roehrich @xcite that the thermal conditions at rhic at forward rapidities , @xmath3 , correspond to the sps conditions at mid - rapidity .",
    "details of our procedure of determining the dependence of thermal parameters on @xmath0 are explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "our strategy , as usual , is to fix the features of the fireball with the well - measured spectra of particles : pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons .",
    "the strange chemical potential obtained from the fit to the @xmath5 ratio is such that the local strangeness density on the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath15 is compatible with zero .",
    "the experimental @xcite rapidity spectra of net protons , @xmath23 , are reproduced qualitatively in the model , displaying the correct shape but overshooting the data at larger rapidities by about 50% .",
    "the chosen geometry of the fireball incorporates a decreasing transverse size as @xmath21 is increased , which simultaneously results in a decreasing transverse flow .",
    "this choice is verified in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] by reproducing the spectra @xmath24 at a fixed @xmath25 of pions and kaons at @xmath26 from the brahms collaboration @xcite .",
    "these transverse - momentum spectra exhibit slopes which become steeper with rapidity .",
    "as a result of our study , we obtain the `` topography '' of the fireball , which can be the ground for other more detailed studies , discussed in the conclusion .",
    "the single - freeze - out model is described in detail in refs .",

    "we review the main assumptions and the formalism of describing the expansion and particle decays .    1 .   at a certain stage of evolution of the fireball the thermal equilibrium between hadrons",
    "is reached .",
    "most probably , hadrons are `` born '' already in such an equilibrated state .",

    "the values of these parameters depend on the position within the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   in the boost - non - invariant model",
    "the shape of the fireball is nontrivial in the longitudinal direction . in this paper",
    "we retain the azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the velocity field of the collective expansion is chosen in the form of the hubble flow @xcite , providing the longitudinal and transverse flow to the system . again , in the boost - non - invariant model the functional form of the velocity field may depend on the longitudinal position .",
    "the evolution after freeze - out includes decays of resonances which may proceed in cascades .",
    "all resonances from the particle data tables hagiwara:2002fs are incorporated .",
    "elastic rescattering among particles after the chemical freeze - out is ignored and the model may be viewed as an approximation to a more detailed evolution , taking into account different time scales for various hadronic processes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the single freeze - out concept complies to the _ explosive scenario _ at rhic @xcite .",
    "moreover , the approach reproduces very efficiently the particle abundances , the transverse - momentum spectra , including particles with strangeness @xcite , produces very reasonable results for the resonance production @xcite , the charge balance functions in rapidity @xcite , the elliptic flow @xcite , the hbt radii @xcite , and the transverse energy @xcite . recently with the help of rqmd @xcite it was found ( cf .",
    "16 and 17 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the elastic rescattering effects are not significant for the mid - rapidity @xmath31 spectra of pions .",
    "one can understand this as follows : resonance decays `` cool '' the spectra broniowski:2001we . as the result , the original @xmath32 spectra from the chemical freeze - out look , after feeding from resonances , approximately as @xmath33 spectra , which would be obtained at the the lower temperature of the thermal freeze - out .",
    "thus elastic rescattering becomes innocuous .",
    "certainly , more studies are desirable here , in particular an `` afterburner '' performing elastic rescattering could be run on top of our simulation .",
    "it would help to achieve a more accurate collision picture , with the elastic rescattering processes taken fully into account .",
    "popular choices of the freeze - out hypersurface and the collective velocity field are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we modify in a very simple way the original boost - invariant single - freeze - out model of ref .",
    "broniowski:2001we , broniowski:2001uk , broniowski:2002nf by making the transverse size of the fireball dependent on the spatial rapidity .",
    "we use the freeze - out hypersurface parameterized as @xmath34 the parameter @xmath0 is the _ spatial rapidity _ , while @xmath35 is related to the transverse radius as @xmath36 the four - velocity field is chosen to follow the hubble law@xmath37 we note that the longitudinal flow is @xmath38 ( as in the one - dimensional bjorken model @xcite ) , while the transverse flow ( at @xmath39 ) has the form @xmath40 .",
    "the new element of the parameterization of this paper , which implements the departure from boost invariance , is the selection of boundaries for the fireball . in the boost invariant model @xmath13",
    "was limited by the space - independent parameter @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "now we take @xmath43 the interpretation of this formula is clear : as we depart from the center by increasing @xmath21 , we simultaneously reduce @xmath35 , or @xmath41 . the rate of this reduction is controlled by a new model parameter , @xmath44 . since in our model",
    "the flow is linked to the position via eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , we also have less transverse flow as we increase @xmath21",
    ". this feature will show in the @xmath31 spectra presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we may also use more conveniently the parameter @xmath45 thus the geometry and expansion of the fireball is described by three parameters : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath44 .    with the standard parameterization of the particle four - momentum in terms of rapidity @xmath25 and the transverse mass @xmath48 ,",

    "the cooper - frye @xcite formalism then yields the following expression for the momentum density of a given species of primordial particles : @xmath53 where @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pu ] ) is taken at @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the statistical distribution function ( with @xmath57 for fermions and @xmath58 for bosons ) , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 denoting the baryon number , strangeness , and the third component of isospin of the particle .",
    "thus we admit the dependence of chemical potentials on the spatial rapidity .",
    "this is of course necessary if we wish to describe in the framework of a statistical model the increasing density of net protons as we move from mid - rapidity towards the fragmentation region .",
    "the temperature @xmath28 also in general depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the best model - building strategy here would be to use the universal cleymans - redlich chemical freeze - out curve @xcite in the @xmath22-@xmath28 space ( for a recent status see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . that way the functional dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath0 induces unambiguously the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath0 . in this work",
    ", however , we apply the model for not too large values of the rapidity , @xmath64 , and it will turn out that the obtained values for @xmath22 are less than @xmath65 .",
    "the universal freeze - out curve gives from @xmath66 to @xmath67 a practically constant value of @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , at sps ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) one has michalec:2001um @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , with the value of @xmath28 equal within errors to the rhic value of 165  mev .",
    "for this reason in the present analysis we fix the freeze - out temperature at a constant ( independent of the spatial rapidity ) value , @xmath74 if modeling were made for larger values of the rapidity and/or lower collision energies , the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath0 should be incorporated according to the prescription based on the universal freeze - out curve .",
    "eventually , we expect that when the fragmentation region is approached , @xmath28 becomes very small and @xmath22 reaches the value of the order of 1  gev .",
    "another qualitative argument for the approximate constancy of @xmath28 at moderate values of @xmath21 may be inferred directly from the brahms data . from the measured rapidity spectra ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bry ] ) , obviously , the yields of pions and kaons decrease with @xmath25 .",
    "thus , one needs to decrease the size of the emitting source , decrease the freeze - out temperature , or both .",
    "the decrease of temperature affects more strongly the particles with larger masses , since the thermal factor is approximately @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , if we introduced variation of the temperature with the spatial rapidity , it would result in a faster drop with @xmath25 of the pion yields compared to the kaons .",
    "certainly the data excludes this situation , since the ratio of @xmath76 to @xmath77 is within a few percent independent of @xmath25 in the brahms rapidity coverage .",
    "therefore we must keep @xmath28 constant ( within a few percent ) , and the remaining possibility is the decrease of the source size with @xmath21 .",
    "resonance decays complicate the above qualitative argument , but with the help of a numerical simulation we confirm it .",
    "another way of providing the drop of yields with rapidity is to incorporate the @xmath27 non - equilibrium factors @xcite dependent on @xmath0 , which may dilute the system as @xmath21 increases .",

    "+    at this point we have accomplished the goal of fixing the `` fireball topography '' : we have the geometry / flow as well as thermal parameters dependent on the variable @xmath0 .",
    "next , we may proceed as in the case of the boost - invariant model used at mid - rapidity , and compute many observables in addition to those already used up to fix the model parameters .",
    "these observables include one - body observables , such as spectra of various particles , including hyperons , mesonic resonances , _ etc .",
    "_ , as well as two - body observables related to correlations : hbt radii , balance functions in rapidity , or event - by - event fluctuations . here we only present a sample prediction for rapidity spectra of hyperons , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hyper ] .",
    "an interesting feature is the very small splitting of @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which results from the fact that @xmath141 , cf .",

    "the paper contains results of the single - freeze - out thermal model for rapidity - dependent spectra in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we have used therminator to run the simulations and the brahms data for @xmath26 @xmath142 collisions to fix the model parameters .",
    "such a simulation is necessary when the system is not boost - invariant .",
    "it allows for an exact incorporation of the space - time dependence of thermal parameters , precise inclusion of resonance decays , as well as incorporation of experimental cuts .",
    "the extension of the original boost - invariant single - freeze - out model includes a modification of the shape of the fireball , which here becomes narrower as the magnitude of the spatial rapidity @xmath0 increases , as well as admits the dependence of the thermal parameters on @xmath0 . as a result of a fit to the brahms data we have obtained the dependence of the freeze - out chemical potentials on @xmath0 .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is taken constant in the considered range of rapidities . with this extension",
    "we are able to properly describe the double @xmath24 spectra from the experiment .",
    "we also make predictions for other particles , in particular for hyperons .",
    "a code incorporating the elastic collisions neglected in the single - freeze - out approach could be used as an `` afterburner '' starting from our freeze - out condition . that way a more accurate collision picture could be achieved . as we have already mentioned , a recent study of ref .",
    "@xcite revealed that for the mid - rapidity @xmath31-spectra the elastic rescattering is not very important .",
    "certainly , the scheme of this paper can be used for other collisions where departures from the boost invariance are significant , in particular for the rich sps data .",
    "as we have said , the modeling involves the choice of the parameterization for the shape of the fireball and the velocity field of flow , where in fact we have quite a lot of freedom , as well as the dependence of the thermal parameters at freeze - out on the space - time position .",
    "accurate data for numerous observables as functions of the rapidity , not only abundances and spectra but also the correlation data ( hbt radii , balance functions ) , would greatly help to constrain the freedom and acquire insight into the space - time evolution picture of boost - non - invariant systems formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "most importantly , the knowledge of the dependence of @xmath143 on @xmath25 would put constraints on the shape of the fireball .",
    "1 .   naive extraction of the baryon and strange chemical potentials from ratios of @xmath144 and @xmath5 works surprisingly well , as shown in the comparison to the full calculation in fig .",
    "[ fig : muy ] .",
    "the baryon and strange chemical potentials grow with @xmath35 , reaching at @xmath3 values close to those of the highest sps energies of @xmath145 .",
    "this agrees with the recent conclusions of roehrich @xcite .",
    "3 .   at mid - rapidity",
    "the values of the chemical potentials are even lower than derived from the previous thermal fits to the data for @xmath146 , with our values taking @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the reason for this effect is that the particle with @xmath146 originate from a region @xmath149 , and on the average the effective values of chemical potentials are larger compared to the values at the very origin ( cf .",
    "[ fig : muy ] ) .",
    "the local strangeness density of the fireball is compatible with zero at all values of @xmath0 .",
    "although this feature is natural in particle production mechanisms , here it has been obtained independently just from fitting the chemical potentials to data .",
    "the ratio of the baryon to strange chemical potentials varies very weakly with rapidity , ranging from @xmath150 at midrapidity to @xmath151 at larger rapidities .",
    "the @xmath152 spectra of pions and kaons are well reproduced , supporting our hypothesis for the shape of the fireball in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the rapidity shape of the spectra of protons and antiprotons measured by brahms @xcite is described properly , while the model predict too large normalization , overproducing these particles by about 50% .",
    "this suggests a lower value of @xmath28 by a few percent , or presence of non - equilibrium factors .",
    "we also note that the feature of an increasing yield of the net protons with rapidity is obtained naturally , explaining the shape of the rapidity dependence on purely statistical grounds ."
