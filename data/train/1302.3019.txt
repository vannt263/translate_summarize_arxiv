    "galaxy morphology is a subject of significant recent turmoil , both theoretically and observationally .",
    "the early - type disk galaxies have an important role in this debate . in the current paradigm of galaxy formation",
    "@xcite morphology at high redshifts is a transient property changing between spirals and ellipticals , e.g disks are renovated after each merger event , unless the gas in the halo becomes too hot for participating in the disk re - building anymore .",
    "after the merger dominated era , intrinsic secular dynamical evolution is expected to play an increasing role .",
    "a different view is taken by @xcite who suggested that most stars in bulges and disks form in situ from hot and cold gas falling in from the halo . in that case",
    "no correlation is expected between the stellar population ages and the epochs of the formation of structures in galaxies .    even within the standard picture of galaxy evolution",
    "there is an active debate of how important secular evolution is in the formation of structures of local galaxies , when did the secular processes start to dominate , and what are the driving forces of that evolution .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that even up to 50@xmath2 of the spiral galaxy disks might have been formed via disk rebuilding soon after the most recent merger event . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamical evolution can be largely driven by bars @xcite , without invoking any significant gas accretion .",
    "one important problem in the present - day cosmological simulations is that disk galaxies with excessive @xmath3 flux - ratios and too large values of the srsic index are created @xcite , unless the galaxies have extremely quiescent merger and gas accretion histories @xcite .",
    "disk - like bulges ( low srsic index ) are created also in cosmological simulations by starbursts at high redshifts , but those bulges are still very massive compared to typically observed bulges @xcite . in non - cosmological simulations , where it is possible to study a controlled range of various parameters , the problem of massive bulges can be avoided if the galaxies evolve in very dense environments @xcite , or if two gas rich pure disk galaxies are made to merge @xcite . however , a large majority of the s0s in the local universe have low @xmath3 flux - ratios ; moreover their srsic indexes are close to 1 - 2 indicating that the bulges are fairly exponential @xcite . in cosmological simulations disks",
    "are easily destroyed by infalling satellites @xcite , or by accretion of misaligned gas @xcite , which is challenging when explaining the observed large - scale lenses in many s0 galaxies .",
    "lower @xmath3 flux - ratios and longer lasting disk structures are expected if galaxy evolution after z@xmath01 was mostly quiescent . in that case",
    "the s0s could be largely red and dead ( or at most partly re - rejuvenated ) former spirals in which the gas does not participate in the disk re - building anymore .",
    "strong support for this comes from the recently suggested scenario , in which the s0s form a parallel sequence with the spirals in the hubble diagram @xcite , renovating the old idea of @xcite . in that scenario both the early and late - type spirals evolve directly into s0s forming s0a , s0b and s0c types .",
    "this makes it possible to understand the observed small @xmath3 flux - ratios in some s0s , and also why the properties of the bulges and disks are so similar in the s0s and spirals @xcite .",
    "motivated by the fact that as much as 70@xmath2 of the s0s live in galaxy groups @xcite @xcite suggested that the transformation from spirals into s0s could occur via minor mergers , leading to the observed parallel sequence , provided that the bulges were originally very small disk - like components .",
    "bars might also be a driving force in the transformation process , though that has not been studied in detail yet .",
    "understanding the formation of bars , lenses and rings is important , and it is not yet clear what exactly they mean for galaxy dynamics and evolution ( see review by buta 2013 ) .",
    "the least well - understood are the lenses , which are morphological components with a shallow brightness gradient interior to a sharp edge .",
    "one formation process suggested for the lenses in the s0s is that they formed via bar dissolution , finally ending up to nearly axisymmetric structures @xcite .",
    "however , this can not be the whole story , because more than one type of lenses ( nuclear , inner and outer ) exist , and often multiple lenses are found in the same galaxies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , lenses can form via disk instability in a similar manner as bars @xcite , or via truncated star formation in the distant past @xcite . however , none of the above processes are capable of explaining multiple lenses in s0s , of which a pictorial example is ngc 1411 @xcite .",
    "recently a new lens - type , a _ barlens _ , was recognized by @xcite , identified as a distinct rounder component in the inner part of a bar .",
    "if barlenses form part of the bar , this opens a new angle for understanding bars and lenses in galaxy evolution , which will be discussed in this study .    in order to study possible manifestations of secular evolution in galaxy morphology ,",
    "statistics of the structural components are compiled , and the dimensions of the structures are studied for a sample of @xmath0 200 early - type disk galaxies , mainly s0s .",
    "we find that bars are important drivers of secular evolution in galaxies .",
    "in particular , a new explanation for the formation of inner lenses in the non - barred galaxies is suggested .",
    "as a database we use the near - ir s0 galaxy survey ( laurikainen et al . 2011 ; hereafter nirs0s atlas ) , which is a magnitude ( m@xmath4@xmath512.5 mag ) and inclination ( less than 65@xmath6 ) limited sample of @xmath0 200 early - type disk galaxies , including 160 s0+s0/a galaxies , 33 sa spirals , and 12 late - type ellipticalsm@xmath4@xmath712.7 , which strictly speaking do not belong to the magnitude - limited sample . however , none of the results reported below would change if they are omitted from the statistics . ] .",
    "the @xmath8-band images typically reach a surface brightnesses of 23.5 mag arcsec@xmath9 in azimuthally averaged profiles , being 2 - 3 magnitudes deeper than the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) images . in this study",
    "we use the new morphological classifications of the nirs0s atlas , where also the measurements of the dimensions of the structures are given .",
    "the morphological classification is based on the de vaucouleurs revised hubble - sandage system , but is more detailed than that .",
    "it includes the stage ( s0@xmath10 , s0@xmath6 , s0@xmath11 , sa ) , family ( sa , sab , sb ) , variety ( r , rs , s ) , outer - ring or pseudo - ring ( r , r ) , possible spindle shape , and the presence of peculiarity .",
    "lenses ( nuclear , inner , outer ) are systematically coded , in a similar manner as in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the classification distinguishes ansae and x - shaped bars from regularly shaped bar morphologies .",
    "also , due to the sub - arcsecond pixel resolution , it was possible to classify central structures like nuclear bars , rings and lenses in a systematic manner .",
    "the nirs0s atlas includes also identification of weak bars in the residual images , after subtracting the bulge model , obtained from the structural decompositions . alternatively ,",
    "weak structures were detected in unsharp mask images ( a smoothed image subtracted from the original image ) .",
    "these faint structures , together with the identification of an exponential outer surface brightness profiles form part of the photometric classification given in the nirs0s atlas , which classification is generally used in this study .",
    "examples of the atlas galaxies are shown in figure 1 .",
    "included in the analysis are also the photometric properties of bulges , obtained for the same galaxies by @xcite , based on two - dimensional multi - component structural decompositions . in the decompositions analytical functions ( srsic , ferrers , exponential ) were fitted , in addition to the bulges and disks , also to bars ( including nuclear bars ) , lenses and ovals .      _",
    "l , l , nl _    by lenses we mean flat light distributions in the disks , with fairly sharp outer edges . such structures form part of the original galaxy classification @xcite , though no coding for the lenses was used at that time .",
    "nuclear , inner and outer lenses are denoted by nl , l , and l , respectively . in barred galaxies",
    "the inner lenses have sizes roughly similar to bars , whereas in non - barred galaxies the relative size compared to the galaxy size defines the subtype .",
    "outer lenses are clearly larger than the inner lenses , and nuclear lenses are small central structures with similar sizes as the nuclear rings .    _ bl _    barlenses are lens - like structures embedded in the bars . in distinction to bulges they have much flatter light distributions , whereas in distinction to nuclear lenses they are much larger , typically covering 50@xmath2 of the bar size .",
    "barlenses can be aligned with the main bar , or be slightly twisted from the major axis orientation of the bar .    _",
    "r , r , nr _",
    "rings are structures in which both the inner and outer regions have well defined edges",
    ". the rings can be full rings or non - complete pseudorings , of which both can further have their subtypes ( see buta 1995 ) .",
    "sometimes an inner ring is seen mainly because of dark space around the sides of the bar .    _",
    "rl , rl , nrl _",
    "ringlenses are intermediate types between rings and lenses .",
    "they have no well defined inner edges , but the surface brightness increases towards the outer regions , until the light distribution drops , in a similar manner as in rings .",
    "ringlenses are divided into nuclear , inner and outer structures ( nrl , rl , rl ) in a similar manner as rings .",
    "ringlenses have also similar subtypes as rings .      in the nirs0s atlas",
    "the sizes of the structures are given in the sky plane ( tables 5 and 6 in the atlas ) .",
    "the classified features were first inspected visually in the images . if a feature was a clear ring or ringlens , the cursor was used with iraf routine tvmark to outline the ridge - line . if the feature was a lens the outer edge was mapped instead .",
    "after that an ellipse - fitting program was used to fit the points , which gave the center coordinates , the position angle of the major axis , the major axis radius , and the axis ratio of the component . for bars the edge of the bar defined its size .    in this study",
    "the size measurements given in the nirs0s atlas were converted to the plane of the galactic disk using the orientation parameters obtained from the apparent major axis position angle and the minor - to - major axis ratio , based on fitting ellipses to the outer isophotes .",
    "for the orientation parameters our deep optical ( b , v ) images were used when available , otherwise the @xmath8-band nirs0s images were used .",
    "fractions of bars , lenses and rings are calculated as a function of hubble type , and are given also in different bulge - to - total ( @xmath3 ) flux - ratio and in absolute magnitude bins in @xmath12-band .",
    "tables 1 - 3 give the values for all galaxies in nirs0s , whereas in tables 4 - 6 the values for the barred galaxies are given . in tables 1 and 4 the hubble type bin @xmath134@xmath5t@xmath7@xmath133.5 is not shown , because these galaxies very seldom have any sub - structures . in the lowest galaxy luminosity bin ( tables 3 and 6 )",
    "the galaxy numbers are shown , but no percentages are given .",
    "the percentages in the tables are calculated with respect to the total number of galaxies in each bin .",
    "the fractions in tables 1 - 6 were calculated also including only the s0-s0/a galaxies ( thus excluding sa galaxies ) , but are not shown in the tables , as there were no significant changes .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the fraction among @xmath16 galaxies . in the tables",
    "res means that included in the analysis are also the weak structures visible only in the residual or unsharp mask images . in all the following the sub - types rl or rl are included in the categories rl and rl , respectively .",
    "the absolute magnitudes were calculated using the extended @xmath12-band apparent magnitudes taken from 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "the distances are from the catalog of nearby galaxies by @xcite , which uses h@xmath17 = 75 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 . a correction for galactic extinction",
    "was made using the values given in ned , based on the maps of @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the @xmath3 values are corrected for galactic and internal extinction using different corrections for the bulge and the disk @xcite . by bulge we mean the flux fitted by the srsic function , and by the disk all the remaining flux , which includes , not only the exponential disk , but also the bars , ovals and lenses .",
    "the bar fraction ( sb+sab ) we find among the s0@xmath11 galaxies ( t=@xmath131 ) is as high as for spirals ( t=1 ) , e.g. @xmath0 80@xmath2 have bars .",
    "it gradually drops towards the earlier type systems , being 50@xmath198@xmath2 among the s0@xmath6s ( t=@xmath132 ) , and 35@xmath197@xmath2 among the s0@xmath10 types ( t=@xmath133 ) ( table 1 ) .",
    "the tendency is the same separately for strong ( b ) and weak ( ab ) bars ( see fig .",
    "the tendency of lower bar fractions among the s0 galaxies , compared to spirals , has been previously shown by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using near - ir images for 360 galaxies at z@xmath00 , and by nair @xmath1 abraham ( 2010a ; using 14000 optical images ) at z=0.01 - 0.1 .",
    "the obtained bar fractions among the s0s and spirals were 46@xmath2 vs @xmath065@xmath2 at z=0 , and 12@xmath2 vs 22@xmath2 at z=0.01 - 0.1 , respectively . in both studies",
    "the classification and the identification of bars were done visually .",
    "the large differences in the bar fractions are mainly because nair @xmath1 abraham detected only strong bars , whereas we include also weak bars into the statistics .",
    "a fairly low bar fraction among the s0s has been found also by @xcite at z=0.01 - 0.04 , the fractions being 29@xmath2 and 55@xmath2 for the s0s and spirals , respectively .",
    "however , in their study the hubble type was based on the concentration parameter ( see conselice et al . 2000 ) .",
    "taking into account the large range of @xmath3flux - ratio within one hubble type ( see laurikainen et al .",
    "2010 ) the bar fractions obtained by aguerri et al . and laurikainen et al . are not directly comparable : in aguerri et al .",
    "the implicit association of high @xmath3 for the s0s causes a bias towards the early - type s0s , which have higher @xmath3 flux - ratios and a lower fraction of bars .",
    "the bar fraction depends on the @xmath3 flux - ratio and the luminosity of the galaxy ( tables 2 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "it is clearly higher in fainter galaxies , the fractions being 73@xmath195@xmath2 and 39@xmath195@xmath2 in the galaxy luminosity bins of @xmath1322@xmath20m@xmath21@xmath22@xmath1324 and @xmath1324@xmath20m@xmath21@xmath22@xmath1326 , respectively .",
    "this is the case also separately for strong ( b ) and weak ( ab ) bars , and when only the s0-s0/a galaxies are considered . the fraction of strong bars increases towards a lower @xmath3 flux - ratio ( fig .",
    "the srsic index @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "2c ) is also interesting , since the bulges in the strongly barred galaxies are more exponential than those in weakly barred or in non - barred galaxies .",
    "although all the family classes cover a similar wide range of @xmath23-values , the peak values are shifted with respect to each other : @xmath24@xmath01.75 , 2.25 , and 2.75 for b , ab , and a families , respectively .",
    "the ks - test shows that the distributions of sa and sb galaxies in figures 2b and 2c are different ( p=0.1@xmath2 and 3.4@xmath2 , respectively ) .    compared to non - barred galaxies , lower @xmath3 flux - ratios in barred early - type spirals have been previously found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a similar result was obtained also by @xcite for disk galaxies , without specifying the morphological type . for the s0s somewhat different results",
    "have been obtained depending on the exact sample used @xcite .",
    "based on the results of the current study , this can be understood , because the relative fraction of strong and weak bars varies in these s0 galaxy samples : including a large fraction of weak bars any difference in @xmath3 flux - ratio between barred and non - barred galaxies is easily diluted ( like in laurikainen et al .",
    "bar fractions in the lower luminosity spirals , e.g. in very late - type spirals , have been studied by @xcite : they found that the galaxies with smaller @xmath3 flux - ratios have a larger fraction of bars .",
    "it is worth noting that the bars in the lower luminosity galaxies are not necessarily similar to those in the bright galaxies .      in the nirs0s atlas barlenses",
    "were identified as lens - like structures inside the bar , and they were suggested to form part of the bar itself .",
    "we found that the occurrence of a barlens does not depend on the hubble type ( fig .",
    "3a ) , or on the galaxy luminosity .",
    "the fractions of barlenses in the two absolute magnitude bins are 34@xmath196@xmath2 and 25@xmath196@xmath2 , respectively ( table 6 ) . in table 7",
    "the fractions of the structure components in barred s0-s0/a galaxies with barlenses are compared with those without a barlens .",
    "the clearest difference is that even 52@xmath199@xmath2 of the barlens galaxies have ansae in the main bars , whereas among the galaxies without any barlens only 24@xmath196@xmath2 of bars have ansae .",
    "another noticeable characteristic is that in the barlens galaxies multiple lenses are rare : only 24@xmath198@xmath2 of them have multiple lenses , compared to 56@xmath197@xmath2 in barred galaxies without a barlens .",
    "the occurrence of a barlens is strongly connected to the properties of the bulges so that their fraction increases towards the lower @xmath3 flux - ratios ( fig .",
    "3b ) , and lower values of the srsic index ( fig .",
    "these characteristics are partly related to the fact that barlenses are more common among the strongly barred galaxies ( 62@xmath199@xmath2 and 38@xmath199@xmath2 among the b and ab families , respectively ; see table 9 ) , which also have fairly low @xmath3 flux - ratios and small values of the srsic index .",
    "lenses are common features in the early - type disk galaxies ( see also laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2009 , 2011 ; nair @xmath1 abraham 2010b ) , and are crucial for identifying the s0s .",
    "lenses are found to be distributed over all hubble types in nirs0s , but the fully developed lenses ( l , l ) are more frequent among the early - type s0s ( t=@xmath133 ) . for barred galaxies this",
    "is shown in figure 4a ( table 4 ) : among the hubble type t=@xmath133 , even 59@xmath1912@xmath2 of the barred s0s have an outer lens , and 41@xmath1912@xmath2 have an inner lens .",
    "on the other hand , the fraction of nuclear lenses ( @xmath025@xmath2 ) is nearly constant as a function of hubble type , until it drops at t=@xmath133 .",
    "a significant fraction of the inner rings and ringlenses appear at hubble type t=@xmath131 , after which the fraction gradually drops towards the later types ( fig .",
    "outer rings also appear in the s0s , but they are even more common in the early - type spirals .",
    "rings are generally thought to be resonance structures of bars @xcite , or linked to resonances via bar - driven manifolds @xcite .",
    "they indeed appear mainly in barred galaxies , the fractions of outer , inner and nuclear rings being 14@xmath2 , 17@xmath2 and 12@xmath2 , respectively , in contrast to the ring - fractions of 1 - 7@xmath2 among the non - barred galaxies ( table 8) .",
    "using optical images the ring fractions might be even higher because many rings are known to be active star forming regions ( see buta @xmath1 combes 1996 ; grouchy et al .",
    "2010 ; comern et al .",
    "it is worth noting that although nuclear lenses appear in all hubble types , nuclear rings are more concentrated in late - type s0s ( t=@xmath131 ) , in a similar manner as inner rings .      as rings and ring - lenses",
    "are assumed to be related phenomena , also their parent galaxy properties are expected to be similar .",
    "indeed , we find that the distributions of the @xmath3 flux - ratios are similar ( fig . 4e , f ) .",
    "however , the galaxies with full lenses have higher @xmath3-flux ratios , being typically larger than 0.3 ( fig .",
    "4d ) . again",
    ", the tendencies are similar among the inner and outer rings , and among the inner and outer ringlenses . in the highest @xmath3-bin",
    "there are more inner ( l ) than outer lenses ( l ) , which might be partly because the shallow outer lenses are more difficult to detect .",
    "the appearance of rings , ringlenses and lenses is not very sensitive to galaxy luminosity .",
    "however , while lumping together the outer lenses ( l ) and ringlenses ( rl ) they appear more frequently among the fainter galaxies ( 32@xmath195@xmath2 vs. 19@xmath194@xmath2 in the two galaxy luminosity bins , respectively ; table 3 , ) . also , the inner rings ( r , rs ) appear more frequently among the fainter galaxies ( 20@xmath194@xmath2 vs. 3@xmath192@xmath2 , in the two bins , respectively ) .",
    "the tendencies are similar if only the barred galaxies are considered ( table 6 ) .    in conclusion , rings and ringlenses are common in the early - type spirals and in the late - type s0s , whereas the fully developed lenses are more common in the early - type s0s .",
    "there is no strong dependence of the type of structure on galaxy luminosity .",
    "however , the galaxies with full lenses typically have higher @xmath3 flux - ratios than the galaxies with rings or ringlenses .",
    "on the other hand , the occurrence of nuclear lenses does not depend on the hubble type or on the properties of the bulge .",
    "multiple bars have been previously detected in @xmath030@xmath2 of the barred galaxies and in @xmath020@xmath2 of all early - type disk galaxies , by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the sample of erwin @xmath1 sparke consists of 30 barred s0-s0/a galaxies , of which 10 have double bars . in order to detect also the weak bars they used color images and applied the unsharp mask techniques .",
    "the double bar catalog by @xcite is larger , including 38 multiple barred s0+s0/a galaxies collected from the literature .",
    "however , as noticed by erwin the catalog is most probably biased towards peculiar and strongly barred galaxies , since it is randomly collected from different sources .",
    "these results are discussed also in the recent review by @xcite .",
    "the fractions of double bars in the early - type disk galaxies have been studied also by @xcite for a sub - sample of 127 galaxies in nirs0s largely confirming the previous results .    among the s0-s0/a galaxies we detect 35 multiple bars , which makes 20@xmath193@xmath2 of all , and 30@xmath195@xmath2 of the barred s0+s0/a galaxies , fully confirming the previous results .",
    "however , it is worth noting that , compared to @xcite , the total number of double bars in nirs0s is @xmath0 three times larger .",
    "the nirs0s double bar sample is comparable in size with that of the double bar catalog by @xcite , but has the advantage of being magnitude - limited and therefore more complete in a statistical sense .",
    "both in the present study and in @xcite unsharp masks were used to identify the faint nuclear bars . alternatively , we applied also a decomposition approach for detecting the weak bars in the residual images , after subtracting the bulge model from the original image .",
    "these methods of detecting multiple bars are important , because even 40@xmath2 of all nuclear bars are weak or overshadowed by massive bulges in the direct images .",
    "@xcite also showed that the fractions of double bars are similar in s0 , s0/a , and sa galaxies , which we confirm .",
    "we further show that there are no systematic differences in the multiple bar fractions between the different sub - types of the s0s ( fig .",
    "5a ) . in figures 5b ,",
    "c we also show that the occurrence of a nuclear bar is not strongly connected to the properties of the bulges : they appear in the whole range of @xmath3 flux - ratios .",
    "the srsic index is peaked at @xmath23@xmath02.25 .",
    "we detect also seven nuclear bars in galaxies without any main bar , e.g. the bars have similar sizes as typical nuclear bars in barred galaxies . in table 10 the hubble types , the bins of the @xmath3 flux - ratios and the galaxy luminosity bins for these galaxies are shown .",
    "it is worth noting that 5/7 of them have very early hubble types , and appear in the bin of the more luminous galaxies in our sample .",
    "multiple lenses have been identified in the early - type disk galaxies a long time ago @xcite and have also been discussed in detail for some individual galaxies by @xcite .",
    "one of the most spectacular cases is ngc 1411 , which has a series of lenses @xcite . in figure 5",
    "the fractions of multiple lenses are shown , as a function of hubble type , and as a function of the properties of the bulges .",
    "barlenses are excluded here , because they are assumed to form part of the bar .",
    "the following cases are shown : ( 1 ) multiple lens systems consisting of only fully developed lenses ( multi - lens ) , ( 2 ) systems in which one of the lenses has some ring - like characteristics ( multi - rile ) , and ( 3 ) cases in which both lenses have ring - like characteristics ( multi - rl ) .",
    "we find that although multiple bars appear in all hubble types in a similar manner , the fully developed multiple lenses are more frequent among the early - type s0s ( t=@xmath133 , @xmath132 ) .",
    "however , including also ringlenses , they are more uniformly distributed among all hubble types .",
    "also , while multiple bars cover a large variety of @xmath3 flux - ratios , multiple lenses are more common in galaxies with @xmath3 @xmath20 0.3 .",
    "furthermore , the srsic index in multiple - lens galaxies is peaked at larger values , @xmath23@xmath02.75 , as compared to @xmath23@xmath02.25 for the galaxies with multiple bars .",
    "for the barred galaxies this is shown in figure 5 ( tables 4 and 5 ) .    in the nirs0s atlas",
    "multiple lenses were found in 25@xmath193@xmath2 of the s0-s0/a galaxies ( the above categories 1 and 2 combined ) .",
    "focusing only on fully developed lenses ( category 1 ) the fraction is reduced to 11@xmath193@xmath2 .",
    "even 61@xmath2 of all multiple lenses ( all 3 above categories combined ) appear in barred galaxies .",
    "of the fully developed lenses the fraction is somewhat lower , 42@xmath2 of them being barred .",
    "an important new result of this study is that nuclear bars appear preferentially in galaxies with weak main bars .",
    "namely , we found that even 44@xmath198@xmath2 of the galaxies with weak bars ( ab ) , and only 24@xmath196@xmath2 with strong ( b ) bars have nuclear bars ( table 9 ) .",
    "these numbers include the faint nuclear bars detected only in the residual images .",
    "notice that @xcite found equal nuclear bar fractions among the strongly and weakly barred systems .",
    "possible reasons for this difference , compared to our result , are that the sample by erwin @xmath1 sparke is smaller ( 10 double barred galaxies ) and might be biased towards peculiar strongly barred galaxies that have a smaller number of multiple bars . also , for one half of the galaxies optical images were used in their study and therefore some of the weak nuclear bars",
    "might have also been hidden by dust .",
    "most probably the larger sample by @xcite is missing galaxies with weak main bars , and therefore is not suitable to study the effect .",
    "the barlens is an other structure component for which the frequencies are different among the strongly and weakly barred galaxies : the fractions are 62@xmath199@xmath2 vs. 38@xmath199@xmath2 among the b and ab families , respectively .",
    "the differences in the fractions of all the other structures components between the b and ab families are only marginal .",
    "it is also interesting that although the fractions of the structure components in the non - barred galaxies ( a ) are typically very small ( 3 - 10@xmath2 ) , even 21@xmath2 of them have inner lenses ( l ) .",
    "in fact , the fraction of the inner lenses is found to be constant among all the family classes ( see table 9 ) .",
    "the dimensions of the structure components are studied using the measurements given in the nirs0s atlas ( tables 5 and 6 ) , after converting them to the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "no internal extinction corrections were applied to the lengths . in the atlas",
    "two additional length estimations are provided for many of the bars , based on the radial profiles of the ellipticities , but as only the visual length estimation is available for all bars , it is used in this study .",
    "the main bars were found to have a mean size ( = semi - major axis length ) of @xmath0 4 kpc , in agreement with the previous studies ( see for example erwin 2005 , 2011 ) .",
    "no difference was found in the main bar sizes between single and multiple bar galaxies , the mean sizes being 4.1@xmath190.4 kpc and 4.4@xmath190.4 kpc , respectively ( see table 11 ) .",
    "this differs from @xcite who found smaller bars in galaxies with single bars , with typical sizes of @xmath02.5 kpc .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is that some single bars in the nirs0s atlas were classified as nuclear bars , based on their small sizes in respect of the galaxy diameter .",
    "some of such small bars in the sample by erwin might have been considered as main bars .",
    "the sizes of nuclear bars in our sample cover the range of 0.1 - 1.5 kpc , ( with the mean of 0.7@xmath190.4 kpc ) , comparable with that obtained by @xcite who give a size range of 0.1 - 1.2 kpc .",
    "nuclear bars in galaxies that do not have any main bar , have the sizes of 0.3 - 0.9 kpc , well within the range of typical sizes of nuclear bars .",
    "the dimensions of the inner rings ( r ) , lenses ( l ) and ringlenses ( rl ) have been previously studied by @xcite for a sample of 120 disk systems , including 41 s0-s0/a galaxies .",
    "these early - type systems form part of the nirs0s atlas , thus allowing us to compare our measurements with those obtained by kormendy . in both studies",
    "the lengths were measured in a similar manner . in cases",
    "where the assigned hubble type differed between the two studies , we adopted the one given in nirs0s atlas ( the classification by kormendy was based on the second reference catalogue of bright galaxies by de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs @xmath1 corwin 1976 ) .",
    "kormendy ( 1979 ) normalized the sizes of the structures to the bar size , without deprojecting the images to the disk plane , and the major or minor axis length of the ring / lens was chosen depending on which one was closer to the bar size .",
    "this guaranteed that the relative lens / bar size was correctly estimated regardless of the viewing angle .",
    "the comparison to kormendy ( 1979 ) is shown in figure 6a , where the length of the structure is normalized to the bar size .",
    "it appears that in the overlapping sub - sample of nirs0s the lengths of the rings , lenses and ring - lenses are very similar in the two studies .",
    "the peak values are _",
    "length_(r , rl , l)/_length_(bar ) @xmath01 for all structures , e.g. they typically all end up to the bar radius .",
    "this similarity in the lengths of bars and inner lenses was used by @xcite to suggest that lenses are formed from bars , e.g. there is a process which makes some bars to evolve rapidly into a nearly axisymmetric state .",
    "kormendy excluded three outliers , ngc 936 , ngc 4262 and ngc 3412 , having _ length_/ _ length_(bar)@xmath201.3 . for the first two galaxies the lens was considered to be an outer lens by him , and for ngc 3412 his barlength measurement was uncertain . in our measurements",
    "there is one outlier , ngc 4612 , but in this galaxy the lens is truly larger than the bar .",
    "as this galaxy has also an outer ringlens , the structure we assign as an inner lens can not be a misclassified outer lens .",
    "however , it is worth noting that although our length measurements are in a good agreement with those of @xcite the structures classified as lenses ( l ) by kormendy ( 67@xmath199@xmath2 are lenses ) are largely ringlenses ( rl ) or rings ( r ) in our classification ( only 18@xmath198@xmath2 are lenses ) .",
    "it seems that we have interpreted the broad dispersed rings as real rings or ringlenses , whereas kormendy has interpreted them as lenses . in total",
    "the sample by kormendy has only a few galaxies having structures that we call as lenses . in his study kormendy",
    "used red and blue palomar sky survey ( poss ) copy plates .",
    "next we look at the normalized sizes of the structures in the complete nirs0s .",
    "the following peak values were found : _",
    "length_(r , rl , l)/_length_(bar)=0.9 , 1.1 and 1.3 for rl , r and l , respectively ( see fig .",
    "6b ; our bins are 0.2 units wide ) , indicating that in fact only the rings and ringlenses end at the bar radius , whereas the fully developed lenses are clearly larger than the bar .",
    "using the ks - test the difference for the lenses and rings is found to be statistically significant : the probability that their distributions are drawn from the same population is only p=0.07@xmath2 .",
    "for the distributions of ringlenses and lenses the difference is not statistically significant ( p=4.4@xmath2 ) , nor for the distributions of rings and ringlenses ( p=86@xmath2 ) .",
    "although the size difference between the rings and lenses might be partly due to the different ways of measuring the structures ( edge of the structure for bars and lenses , and the ridge - line for rings and ringlenses ) , it does not wash out the conclusion that the lenses are on average slightly larger than the bar .",
    "all structures have also small tails towards larger normalized lengths .",
    "some galaxies were eliminated in the figure for the following reasons : a ) the bar is subtle , peculiar , or has an unfavorable orientation in the sky ( ngc 1537 , ngc 4203 , ngc 3489 , ngc 6012 and ngc 6438 ) .",

    "the galaxy ic 5328 , which in the nirs0s atlas was interpreted to have a lens ( _ length_(l)/_length_(bar)=0.35 ) , was excluded because the small lens is in fact a barlens .",
    "one can ask whether the fairly large inner lenses ( _ length_(l)/_length_(bar)@xmath01.3 - 1.5 ) are actually outer lenses .",
    "the answer is that most probably not , because proper outer lenses typically have dimensions of the outer rings , or are even larger . for the outer rings the normalized lengths peak at _ length_(r)/_length_(bar)=2.2 , which is in a good agreement with the mean value of 2.21@xmath190.12 obtained by @xcite and buta ( 1995 ) in the b - band . for the outer ringlenses ( rl ) and outer lenses ( l ) the variations in the lengths are large , the distributions lacking any clear peaks . in those non - barred galaxies in which a series of lenses are detected",
    ", the terminology of inner and outer lenses is merely academic .      in order to compare the dimensions of rings and lenses in barred and non - barred galaxies ,",
    "the lengths were normalized to the galaxy size , r@xmath25 .",

    "1991 ) . in barred galaxies",
    "the bar defines the lens type : the inner lens is located at , or near to the bar radius , whereas the outer lens has typically twice the size of the bar , in a similar manner as the inner and outer rings @xcite .",
    "however , in the non - barred galaxies the smaller lens is simply called the inner lens and the larger one is the outer lens .",
    "if only one lens is present , its size relative to the galaxy size defines the inner / outer characteristic .",
    "an alternative would be to use some limit in kiloparsecs , based on a typical bar size in galaxies .",
    "however , taking into account that the relative bar size varies a lot from one galaxy to an other , this is not necessarily a better approach .",
    "the number histograms of the lens dimensions in the barred and non - barred galaxies are compared in figure 7 where , for better statistics , lenses and ringlenses are grouped together .",
    "the comparison is made first by lumping together the inner and outer structures , which shows that the lenses in the non - barred galaxies are in general clearly smaller ( fig .",
    "this might be partly because more outer lenses are detected in barred galaxies , but that does not explain all of the size difference .",
    "this becomes clear when comparing the inner structures ( for which better statistics is available ) separately for barred and non - barred galaxies ( figs .",
    "7b , c ) : while the peak value for the non - barred galaxies is 0.2 , for barred galaxies it is 0.4 ( the mean values are 0.28@xmath190.03 and 0.41@xmath190.03 , respectively ) .",

    "7c ) is very similar to that for barlenses in _ barred galaxies _ ( the mean value is 0.20@xmath190.01 ) .",
    "this is a puzzle that needs to be explained .      in the following the relative dimensions of lenses in multiple systems",
    "are compared in barred and non - barred galaxies .",
    "we are particularly interested in the inner and outer lenses , excluding the nuclear lenses , which leads to the total number of 17 galaxies .",
    "this number includes the cases in which the multiple systems are a combination of full ( l , l ) and intermediate type ( rl , rl ) lenses .",
    "there is a tendency showing that the mean ratio of the outer to inner lenses is larger for the non - barred galaxies , e.g. , @xmath7_length_(l , rl)/_length_(l , rl)@xmath20 = 2.5@xmath190.2 ( n=8 ) , as compared to 1.9@xmath190.2 ( n=8 ) for the barred galaxies ( see table 11 ) .",
    "we can also look at the length ratio separately for those multi - lens systems , in which both lenses are fully developed , which gives @xmath7 _ length_(l)/_length_(l)@xmath20=2.85@xmath190.19 ( n=4 ) .",
    "taking into account the small number statistics the dispersions ( what is given is the standard deviation of the mean , equal to std/@xmath30 ) are fairly small .",
    "for ngc 1574 the length ratio is @xmath05 .",
    "this galaxy was excluded because the dimension of the outer lens was hard to define accurately .",
    "the average length ratio 1.9 obtained for multiple lenses in barred galaxies is similar to that obtained by us for the outer to inner rings , e.g. _",
    "length_(r)/ _ length_(r)@xmath02.0 ( calculated from the peak values of the length distributions for the inner and outer rings , both normalized to barlength ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the previous measurements by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the rings .",
    "distributions of the galaxy luminosities for the barred and non - barred galaxies in the @xmath12-band are shown in figure 8 .",
    "clearly , there is no upper limit in galaxy luminosity ( mass ) for bar formation . in @xcite",
    "such a cutoff limit was reported to appear at m@xmath31=@xmath1322 mag , corresponding to m@xmath21=@xmath1325 mag . also , barred and",
    "non - barred galaxies cover nearly the same range of total galaxy luminosities .",
    "however , there is a tendency of increasing mean galaxy luminosity from strongly barred ( b ) towards weakly barred ( ab ) , and non - barred ( a ) galaxies .",
    "the mean absolute magnitudes in the @xmath12-band are ( the uncertainties are standard deviations of the mean ) :    @xmath7m@xmath21@xmath20 ( a ) = @xmath1324.11@xmath190.15 @xmath7m@xmath21@xmath20 ( ab ) = @xmath1323.78@xmath190.12 @xmath7m@xmath21@xmath20 ( b ) = @xmath1323.52@xmath190.14 .",
    "it thus appears that the non - barred galaxies are on average 0.6 mag brighter than the strongly barred systems . for the nirs0s atlas",
    "the luminosity difference between the barred and non - barred galaxies was indicated also by @xcite . the difference in the mean galaxy luminosities between the barred ( b+ab ) and non - barred (",
    "a ) s0s was shown also by @xcite .",
    "as for the main bars , also for the nuclear bars there is no cutoff magnitude limit for the bar formation ( fig . 8)",
    "also , the galaxy luminosity distributions are similar for the barred galaxies in general , and separately for the galaxies with nuclear bars .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that galaxy mass uniquely determines the bar size , and also the sizes of all the other components associated with the bar , e.g. , the inner and outer lenses , and the inner and outer rings .",
    "he tested this idea showing a correlation between the @xmath26-band galaxy brightness and the length of the structure .",
    "the correlations for all the structure components were found to be tight within one hubble type bin .",
    "later type galaxies were systematically shifted towards larger galaxy brightnesses , which was interpreted to follow from their disks having a larger amount of recent star formation . in this study",
    "we can re - investigate this issue in the near - ir , which is much less affected by star formation .",
    "we also extend the study to non - barred galaxies and to different sub - types of the s0s .",
    "we confirm the previous result of @xcite in a sense that a clear correlation exists between the absolute galaxy magnitude and the length of the bar ( fig .",
    "overall the s0s occupy roughly the same region as the early - type spirals ( t=1 ) .",
    "however , for a given barlength , the early - type s0s ( t=@xmath133 , @xmath132 ) are brighter than the late - type s0s ( t=@xmath131 ) , opposite to the trend found by kormendy in the optical region . for spirals and for s0 galaxy sub - types",
    "the following relations are found :    t=1 : m@xmath21 = @xmath134.0 log d - 21.6 ,    t=@xmath131 : m@xmath21 = @xmath139.1 log d - 18.0 , t=@xmath133 : m@xmath21 = @xmath133.4 log d - 22.9    where d stands for bar length in kpc . combining t=@xmath133 , @xmath132 the coefficients of correlation are @xmath133.6 and @xmath1322.5 , and for t=@xmath131,0 they are @xmath134.6 and @xmath1321.6 .",
    "for each morphological type the slope is different from that obtained by @xcite between the galaxy luminosity and its diameter , implying that the surface brightness of the bar is not constant .",
    "compared to the holmberg relation ( dn / dlogd=@xmath135 ) the correlation is shallower for t=@xmath131 and steeper for t=@xmath133 .",
    "it is worth noting that although the correlation for t=@xmath131 is tight , it does not fall between the regression line of the earlier and later hubble types .",
    "this might be related to the fact that the bar length ( normalized to galaxy size ) maximum appears at t=@xmath131 ( see fig .",
    "5 in laurikainen et al . 2007 ) , e.g. all bars in these hubble types are long , independent of the galaxy luminosity . but still , the physical meaning of this behavior is unclear .      as for bars , also for the inner rings , ringlenses , and lenses",
    "correlations exist between the size of the structure and the galaxy luminosity .",
    "the dispersions are large , but they are reduced while plotting the different hubble types separately ( fig .",
    "there is no obvious difference in the behavior of rings ( r ) , ringlenses ( rl ) and lenses ( l ) ( fig .",
    "however , while comparing the sizes among the barred and non - barred galaxies ( fig .",
    "10c ) it appears that the inner structures are smaller for the brightest non - barred galaxies .",
    "similar tendencies as for the inner structures were found also for the outer rings ( r ) , ringlenses ( rl ) and lenses ( l ) ( fig .",
    "10d , e , f ) .",
    "we conclude that although the sizes of bars , rings , and lenses depend on the galaxy luminosity , the luminosity does not uniquely define their sizes . in barred galaxies",
    "the size of the structure depends also on the hubble type ( smaller in the early - type s0s ) , and in non - barred galaxies the lenses are smaller in the most luminous galaxies .",
    "secular galaxy evolution is actively debated both from the observational and the theoretical points of view .",
    "large galaxy surveys are under progress , focusing on this topic via galaxy morphology at different redshifts , largely based on automatic analysis approaches .",
    "however , it is also important to study the nearby galaxies , for which more detailed analysis can be made . bars are expected to be important driving forces of secular evolution .",
    "they are efficient drivers of gas to the central regions of the galaxies @xcite , possibly adding mass to the bulge , or even creating nuclear bars @xcite .",
    "bars can drive spiral arms ( salo et al .",
    "2010 and references there ) , or they can be in the dynamical interaction with the halos @xcite as well as with the bulges @xcite , leading to re - distribution of stellar matter in galaxies . in the following possible manifestations of secular evolution in the morphology of the s0 galaxies are discussed .",
    "the fact that the bulges in s0s are on average fairly exponential ( @xmath7n@xmath20@xmath0 2 ) is consistent with the idea that many of them are ( or contain ) pseudobulges ( or in terminology of athanassoula 2005 , disky bulges ) triggered by bars .",
    "however , the result that the @xmath3 flux - ratio is smaller in the strongly barred s0s ( compared to weakly barred or non - barred s0s ) , is seemingly in contrast with bar induced bulge growth , because strong bars are expected to be more efficient drivers of gas to the central regions of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is an alternative point of view .",
    "galaxies that have relatively small ( non - classical ) bulges have slowly rising rotation curves , provided that their dark matter halo is not too centrally concentrated or cuspy ) . in that case",
    "no inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) barrier is expected for inward moving trailing perturbation wave packets , which can thus reflect from the galaxy center as fresh leading packets ( toomre 1981 ; salo @xmath1 laurikainen 2000 ; see also review by athanassoula 1984 ) .",
    "if the disk is reactive ( low value of toomre @xmath32 parameter ) this may lead to an efficient swing amplification cycle @xcite , and a strong secular bar growth ( athanassoula 2012 ) .",
    "because of its strength , such a bar will eventually lead to a growth of a relatively massive pseudo - bulge , but since the galaxy will have no classical bulge its @xmath3 flux - ratio will remain small . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies which initially have a massive ( or classical ) bulge have a more steeply rising rotation curves , implying an ilr for all small to intermediate large pattern speeds , likely to inhibit bar formation or allow only weak bars to grow .",
    "therefore it is possible that the bulges we observe in strongly barred galaxies were induced by bars , whereas the bulges in weakly barred systems were largely formed at the epoch prior to bar formation . in this context",
    "the recent observations by @xcite are interesting , because they have shown that the bulges in barred early - type galaxies are more metal rich and more @xmath33 enhanced than the bulges of their non - barred counterparts .",
    "this indicates that the bulges of typical barred galaxies were formed later than the bulges of non - barred galaxies , possibly in a rapid starburst .",
    "disk - like pseudobulges form also in cosmological simulations due to massive starbursts at high redshifts , without invoking any secular evolution @xcite .",
    "these bulges can be maintained up to the redshift zero , in case that the galaxies have not had any subsequent merger events with mass ratios larger than 0.1",
    ". however , such simulated bulges are generally more massive than the observed bulges , both in spirals and in s0s @xcite .",
    "there are two main types of n - body simulations producing long - lived nuclear bars : those in which the initial conditions of the simulations include a specific inner component , be it a disk or a pseudo - bulge , whose instability could form an inner bar @xcite . or , those in which the nuclear bar forms spontaneously from standard initial conditions @xcite .",
    "it is , however , still an open question , as well as one that needs to be observationally tested , what physical conditions in galaxies are necessary in order to create long - lasting double bars .",
    "double bars appear in 20@xmath2 of the disk galaxies ( laine et al .",
    "2002 ; erwin @xmath1 sparke ; laurikainen et al .",
    "2009 ; this study ) , and therefore are hard to understand merely as transient features in galaxies , as suggested based on the early simulations by friedli @xmath1 martinet ( 1993 ) and englmeier @xmath1 shlosman ( 2004 ) . in this study",
    "we have additionally shown that nuclear bars appear more frequently among the weakly barred ( ab ) than among the strongly ( b ) barred galaxies ( 44@xmath2 and 24@xmath2 , among the ab and b families , respectively ) . from the point of view of our observations",
    "the theoretical models by @xcite are the most interesting . in their models both the nuclear and the main bar",
    "are supported by loops , equivalent to periodic orbits , but for the case of double rather than single bars ( the terminology of loops is from @xcite ) .",
    "maciejewski @xmath1 athanassoula found that the most stable models are those in which the main bar is not too massive , and/or the ellipticity of the bar is not very high ( their models 16 and 17 ) , thus diminishing the fraction of phase - space with chaotic orbits .",
    "this kind of bars are very much like the ab family of bars , which in the present study are found to have a large number of nuclear bars .",
    "an important question is also why do we see nuclear sized bars in galaxies without any main bar .",
    "such galaxies in our sample are : ngc 484 , ngc 1553 , ngc 2902 , ngc 3169 , ngc 3998 , ngc 4694 and ngc 5333 , including the faint bars detected only in the residual images .",
    "characteristic for these galaxies is that they are often luminous and have quite large @xmath3 flux - ratios ( @xmath34=0.44@xmath190.06 ) and relatively large values of the srsic index ( @xmath35=2.6@xmath190.2 ) .",
    "the values are similar or even larger than those in the early - type s0s ( for t=@xmath133 @xmath34=0.39 and @xmath35=2.2 ) , and significantly larger than for the late - type s0s ( see laurikainen et al .",
    "2010 : for t=@xmath131 @xmath34=0.28 , and @xmath35=2.1 ) .",
    "a possible reason why the nuclear sized bars in the non - barred galaxies are so small might be related to the impact of the massive bulges to the rotation curves , which not only makes it harder to create bars ( as discussed in section 6.1 ) , but also makes the bars smaller .",
    "this is because of their higher bar pattern speeds ( must exceed the maximum of @xmath36 - @xmath37/2 ) , which implies shorter co - rotation distances , and therefore also shorter bars .      in his pioneering paper @xcite suggested that lenses in barred galaxies form when the stars in bars are gradually spilled out , forming more axisymmetric structures surrounding the bar . in this picture",
    "the inner lenses are expected to have similar dimensions as the bars .",
    "the similarity of the lengths of bars and bar - related inner structures was shown by kormendy in the optical region for a large range of hubble types , including the s0s .",
    "he also concluded that the galaxy mass ( luminosity ) uniquely defines the sizes of bars and of all the structures related to bars .",
    "however , in this study we found that the fully developed lenses are on average a factor of 1.3 larger than the bar .",
    "we also showed that in the near - ir the galaxy luminosity does not uniquely define the sizes of bars and the bar related structures : the size depends also on galaxy morphology ( smaller in the early - type s0s with t=@xmath133 , @xmath132 ) .",
    "therefore , our observations do not give any clear support to the mechanism suggested by @xcite .",
    "lenses in barred galaxies form also in the simulation models by @xcite , most likely via disk instability in a similar manner as bars .",
    "as the main difference between bars and lenses is in the ellipticity , in her models the lens formation can be accounted for by a larger amount of random motions initially present in the disk , e.g. , the disk is dynamically hot .",
    "if both cool and hot components are present , a bar and a lens can appear in the same galaxy , with the same orientations and lengths .",
    "thus the factor of 1.3 difference in the observed sizes of bars and inner lenses can be a problem also in her models .",
    "lenses in some barred galaxies might also be resonance - related structures , formed by dynamical heating from rings , which are gradually transformed into lenses via a ringlens phase @xcite .",
    "it is easy to find pictorial examples of such possible evolution ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , but we have also other observational evidence supporting this hypothesis .",
    "we showed that the mean ratio for the lengths of the outer ( l , rl ) and inner ( l , rl ) lenses is @xmath01.9 , which is very close to that obtained for the outer and inner rings ( ratio@xmath02.0 ) @xcite . in the linear resonance theory",
    "the predicted length ratio for the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) and the corotation radius ( cr ) is _",
    "length_(olr)/_length_(cr)= 1 + @xmath38/2 @xmath0 1.7 , for a flat rotation curve .",
    "according to typical slopes of the rotation curves of sa - sb galaxies the predicted range is between 1.7 - 2.3 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the rings and ringlenses appear in the same hubble types ( see fig .",
    "12 ) is consistent with this picture .",
    "however , the fully developed lenses are clearly more common in the early - type s0s , and have a larger length difference between the outer and inner components than in case of the rings .",
    "this implies that not all lenses can be formed via a ringlens phase .      in the scenario by @xcite",
    "the lenses in the non - barred galaxies are the end products of the transformation process , e.g. all the stars of the bar have been eventually spilled out into a lens .",
    "other suggestions for the formation of lenses in the non - barred galaxies are those given by @xcite and @xcite . in the models by athanassoula it would mean that the galaxy is dynamically too hot for creating bars , but still cool enough for lens formation .",
    "@xcite showed first observational evidence that lenses in the non - barred galaxies are dynamically distinct from the outer disks .",
    "as the lenses were redder than the disks , he suggested that the primary components formed relatively early in the universe by truncated star formation .",
    "lenses may also form via ringlenses or by winding of the spiral arms in the local universe @xcite . however",
    ", none of these scenarios can readily explain the formation of multiple lenses , or in particular why the inner lenses in the non - barred s0s are as small as those found in this study .",
    "we find the normalized sizes of the inner lenses in the non - barred galaxies to be surprisingly similar to the sizes of barlenses in the barred galaxies : the sizes of both structures peak at _",
    "length_/r@xmath25=0.2 r@xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "this allows to speculate that the inner lenses in the non - barred s0s might actually be former barlenses in galaxies in which the outer bar component has disappeared , possibly during the bar evolution .",
    "the typical dimensions of these structures are illustrated in figure 13 , comparing in the same scale a barred galaxy with a barlens ( ngc 1452 ) , and a non - barred galaxy with an inner lens ( ngc 524 ) .",
    "this hypothetical partial bar destruction phase could be related to a sequence of ansae morphology : from pointy to more and more azimuthally dispersed appearance .",
    "although there is no theoretical explanation for this ( see the review by athanassoula 2012 ) , it is possible to find tentative examples of galaxies , in which such a process might be under progress .",
    "for example , in ngc 1079 it looks like the ansae had already started to disperse into the surrounding inner ring ( see fig . 11 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist also barred galaxies with barlenses in which the ansae under - fill the inner ring ( ngc 7098 ) .",
    "ngc 524 is one of the brightest galaxies in nirs0s , having both nuclear , inner and outer lenses .",

    "ngc 524 has been recently studied spectroscopically by @xcite covering a radial extent of @xmath030  .",
    "within this region , in our morphological classification ( nirs0s atlas ) we detect the small bulge at r@xmath710  , and the inner lens at r@xmath025  .",
    "the nuclear lens inside the bulge has a dimension of r@xmath06.5  .",
    "the outer lens at r@xmath057  was not covered by katkov et al .",

    "similar old stellar populations of the bulges and disks in some other s0s have been detected by @xcite , and for bars in s0s and spirals by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that the ages of the stellar populations of bars and lenses are so similar ( at least in the galaxies studied so far ) , is consistent with the idea that the inner lenses in the non - barred galaxies are partially destroyed bars , e.g. are former barlenses",
    ". however , the observed stellar populations would be consistent also with the alternative suggestions by athanassoula ( 1983 ) , bosma ( 1983 ) , and kormendy ( 1979 ) .",
    "such a dichotomy for the s0s was suggested by @xcite , using the galaxy magnitude m@xmath21=@xmath1324.5 as a dividing line .",
    "the suggestion was based on the argument that the luminous and less luminous galaxies have opposite trends in the scaling relation between the scale length of the disk ( h@xmath39 ) and the effective radius of the bulge ( r@xmath40 ) .",
    "however , in nirs0s , using a few magnitudes deeper images and a much larger sample of s0s , such a dichotomy was not found @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that in barway et al .",
    "the galaxies in both luminosity bins have srsic indexes larger than 3.2 , indicating that the bulges in none of the two groups are pseudobulges in terms of having small srsic indexes . in barway",
    "2-component bulge - disk decompositions were made , while we used a multi - component approach , allowing also fitting of bars and lenses .    however ,",
    "the galaxy luminosity difference of 0.6 mag between the strongly barred and non - barred galaxies observed in this study ( see also van den bergh 2012 , and barway et al .",
    "2009 ) is real . in van den bergh ( 2012 , calculated for nirs0s galaxies )",
    "it was partly attributed to large uncertainties in galaxy classifications between sandage , de vaucouleurs , and us . however",
    ", a comparison of nirs0s classifications with those in a revised shapley ames catalog of bright galaxies ( rsa ) and rc3 shows that the hubble stage in nirs0s generally agrees with that given by sandage , because in both studies special attention was payed to identification of lenses ( which were largely ignored by de vaucouleurs ) . on the other hand , bar classifications in the nirs0s atlas",
    "are more consistent with those given in rc3 : the galaxies classified as ab by us and by de vaucouleurs are typically non - barred in rsa ( the weak ab bar category is lacking in rsa ) .",
    "therefore we do nt see any major classification problem in nirs0s .",
    "it is clear that the bright non - barred s0s can not be merely stripped spirals in which the star formation has been ceased .",
    "aguerri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and @xcite showed that dry intermediate and minor mergers can induce bulge growth so that a galaxy with s0c morphological type can develop into s0b , and s0b into s0a , without significantly increasing the srsic index of the bulge .",
    "this is consistent with the observed @xmath3 flux - ratios in s0s , including some very small values , forming part of the parallel sequence of s0s and spirals ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2010 ; kormendy @xmath1 bender 2012 ) .",
    "however , bulges in the s0@xmath10 galaxies ( @xmath7b / t@xmath20@xmath00.39 ) are on average more massive than in the early - type spirals which is difficult to account for by minor mergers alone , particularly because the galaxies in nirs0s appear mostly outside dense galaxy clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "if these galaxies were formed by major mergers , the fairly small srsic indexes ( @xmath7n@xmath20@xmath02.2 , see laurikainen et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the large number of lenses in the very early - type s0s ( among t=@xmath133 even 30@xmath2 have inner and outer lenses ) would be difficult to explain .",
    "alternatively , the most luminous non - barred galaxies were formed first , and also evolved more rapidly @xcite .    it is worth noticing that in the current study fairly bright galaxies have been discussed .",
    "it is still possible that the lower luminosity s0s , near the borderline to the dwarf early - type galaxies ( des ) , were formed in a different manner ( see barazza et al .",
    "2008 ; kannappan et al .",
    "the structures of des , based on multi - component decompositions , has been recently studied by janz et al .",

    "we use the morphological classifications and the measurements of the dimensions of bars , rings , ringlenses and lenses , given in the nirs0s atlas @xcite , after first converting them to the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "the dust corrected properties of the bulges are taken from @xcite , based on two - dimensional multi - component structural decompositions . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first statistical study of the multiple structure components of the s0s particularly focusing on lenses .",
    "0.35 cm our main conclusions are the following : 0.4 cm    _ ( 1 ) lenses in barred galaxies : _    inner lenses ( l ) in barred s0s are found to be on average a factor of 1.3 larger than the bars ( fig .",
    "this is not consistent with the formative processes of lenses suggested by kormendy ( 1979 ) and athanassoula ( 1983 ) , which favor similar dimensions for bars and lenses . on the other hand , inner rings ( r ) and ringlenses ( rl )",
    "have similar sizes as bars . in barred multiple - lens systems",
    "we find observational evidence of the resonant nature of the lenses : _",
    "length_(l , rl)/_length_(l , rl)=1.9@xmath190.2 , which is similar to the outer and inner rings ( _ length_(r)/_length_(r)@xmath02 ) , generally associated to known resonances of the rotating bar , or linked to resonances via bar - driven manifolds .",
    "0.4 cm    _ ( 2 ) inner lenses in the non - barred s0s : barlenses in former barred galaxies , in which the outer bar component has been destroyed ? _ the normalized sizes of the inner lenses ( l ) in the non - barred galaxies are found to have similar sizes as barlenses ( bl ) in barred galaxies , peaked at _",

    "0.4 cm    _ ( 3 ) inner lenses in the family classes : _ the fractions are found to be nearly constant , being 21@xmath194@xmath2 , 21@xmath195@xmath2 and 16@xmath194@xmath2 in a , ab and b families , respectively . in the non - barred galaxies the fraction of inner lenses is enhanced in respect of all the other structure components .    0.4 cm _ ( 4 ) main bars : _",
    "the bar fraction gradually drops from the sa - s0/a galaxies ( 80@xmath2 have bars ) towards the s0@xmath10 types ( 35@xmath2 have bars ) . the @xmath3 flux - ratio is smaller in the strongly barred ( b ) than in the weakly barred ( ab ) or non - barred ( a ) s0s .",
    "bulges in the strongly barred s0s are interpreted to be triggered by bars , whereas in the weakly barred systems they are suggested to have formed in cumulative accretion events prior to the bar formation .",
    "0.25 cm    the mean semi - major axis length of the main bars is @xmath04 kpc , with no difference in size between the single and double - barred galaxies ( 4.1@xmath190.4 kpc vs. 4.4@xmath190.4 kpc , respectively ) .",
    "the mean size of the nuclear bars is 0.7@xmath190.4 kpc ( 0.1 - 1.5 kpc ) .",
    "the sizes of nuclear bars in non - barred galaxies were found to cover the range 0.3 - 0.9 kpc .    0.4 cm _ ( 5 ) barlenses , manifestations of evolved bars : _",
    "barlenses are typically embedded in the inner parts of those bars that have ansae at the two ends of the bar ( ansae exist in 52@xmath199@xmath2 vs. 24@xmath196@xmath2 of barred galaxies with and without barlenses , respectively ) , and which ansae in the simulation models ( athanassoula @xmath1 misioritis 2002 ) are associated with evolved bars .",
    "the frequency of barlenses does not depend on the galaxy brightness ( 31@xmath195@xmath2 vs. 32@xmath197@xmath2 in the two galaxy luminosity bins , respectively ) . also , multiple lenses are rare in the galaxies with barlenses ( 24@xmath192@xmath2 vs. 56@xmath196@xmath2 in barred galaxies with and without barlenses , respectively ) .    0.4 cm _ ( 6 ) nuclear bars : _ contrary to the previous results we find that nuclear bars appear more frequently in the weakly barred ( ab ) than in strongly barred ( b ) galaxies ( 44@xmath198@xmath2 vs. 24@xmath196@xmath2 among the ab and b galaxies , respectively ) , which is consistent with the theoretical models by maciejewski @xmath1 athanassoula ( 2008 ) .",
    "contrary to the main bars , nuclear bars ( + nuclear lenses ) appear in a similar manner in all hubble types in nirs0s ( until the fraction drops at t=@xmath133 ) .",
    "0.3 cm    nuclear sized single bars are detected in seven non - barred galaxies .",
    "the small sizes of the bars are explained due to the large bulges of these galaxies : they might have prevented the formation of larger bars , due to the high @xmath36 - @xmath37/2 barrier for the bar pattern speed , placing the co - rotation fairly close to the galaxy center . 0.4",
    "cm    _ ( 7 ) does the formation of the structure depend on the galaxy luminosity : _ the family classes a , ab and b cover the same galaxy luminosity range , but the mean luminosity gradually decreases from a -@xmath20 ab -@xmath20 b , so that the non - barred galaxies are on average 0.6 magnitudes more luminous than the strongly barred galaxies",
    ". however , there is no upper limit in galaxy luminosity for bar formation .",
    "also , galaxy luminosity does not uniquely define the sizes of bars , or the structures related to bars .",
    "we acknowledge the significant observing time allocated to this project during 2003 - 2009 , based on observations made with several telescopes .",
