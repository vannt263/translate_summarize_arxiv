    "the physical motivation of the present work is to set the framework for a semiclassical approach to describing the mechanism of monopole catalysis of baryon number decay , proposed by rubakov  @xcite and callan  @xcite .",
    "here we are led by the work of callan and witten  @xcite , where the baryon is described as the soliton of the skyrme  @xcite model , in the backgroud of the @xmath1 maxwell field of a monopole in the dirac gauge . in the present work ,",
    "the baryon is again described by a skyrmion , which in this case interacts with the full @xmath0 non - abelian higgs model ( the georgi - glashow model ) so that the skyrmion we consider is gauged with the full @xmath0 group and interacts with the t  hooft - polyakov monopole  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this model as monopole - skyrmion model ( msm ) .",
    "the most important difference between the present work and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is that here we have _ two _ distinct topological charges - the first being the baryon number of the skyrmion and the second , the monopole charge .",
    "the energy of our composite system therefore has a topological lower bound consisting of a combination of these two charges of rather different geometric natures , the baryon charge being a _ degree _ which can not be expressed as a total divergence while the monople charge is a _ flux _ by virtue of being descended from the second chern - pontryagin class .",
    "the most important feature of describing the interaction of the skyrmion with the gauge field in our monopole - skyrmion model is the presrciption of gauging the skyrme field with the diagonal @xmath2 .",
    "this prescription was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the gauged skyrme model , where no higgs field and higgs potential are present , and the resulting solutions were studied in ref .",
    "most importantly , this gauging permits a lower bound on the energy of the gauged skyrmion unlike in the case when the usual gauging is from the left , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite where there is no lower bound . in this paper , we shall refer to the models arising from the gauging prescription used in @xcite as gauged skyrme models ( gsm ) . since the topological lower bounds for the gsms were presented in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , and because all that we need to know here is that these exist , we do not discuss them further here .",
    "now the presence of a topological lower bound is not a sufficient condition for the existence of a topologically stable soliton . to illustrate this we refer to the graph of the energy versus skyrme coupling constant in fig .  1 for the gsm studied in  @xcite .",
    "without being mathematically rigorous one can suppose that the branches @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to solutions , which form local minima of the energy functional , whereas the connecting branch @xmath5 correspond to solutions , which form sattlepoints .    the bifurcation structure in fig .",
    "1 is quite different from that appearing in models where the skyrme field is gauged as in @xcite without a topological lower bound .",
    "the corresponding graph to fig . 1 in that case is given in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite featuring only two branches as opposed to the three in fig . 1 . of these two branches",
    "@xcite only one corresponds to stable solutions , as expected from the work of refs .",
    ". thus a butterfly pattern of bifurcations with two stable branches seems to be typical of of gsms with topological lower bounds .",
    "we will find in our study of the monopole - skyrme model , that the butterfly of fig . 1 persits for some range of the parameters in the model .",
    "having already presented the lower bound on the energy of monopole - skyrme model in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not repeat it here and proceed straight away to the study the solutions numerically , with a view to exposing some of their qualitative features that may be of some physical interest .",
    "the model we employ here is a slightly modified version of the one in ref .",
    "it features a particular interaction term between the higgs field and the chiral field in such a way that it also fixes the asymptotic values of the chiral field subject to the finite energy condition , and assuring integral baryon number . in section 2",
    "we present the model , discuss its spectrum , and discuss some some scaling properties which will become pivotal in the subsequent numerical analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we subject the system to spherical symmetry and give the classical equations to be integrated , the detailed numerical results of which we give in section 4 . in section 5 we analyse the normal modes of the radial fluctuations around the solutions to the msm , characterised by those values of the parameters for which the solutions display butterfly bifurcations , and verify that indeed the branches corresponding to @xmath5 are unstable . a summary and discussions of our results are given in section 6 .",

    "this confirms the interpretation as a monopole inside a baryon .",
    "note , that the function @xmath181 possesses an additional local maximum at a larger distance from the origin than the global maximum and a minimum with vanishing magnitude between the both maxima .",
    "we found that half the baryonic charge stems from the area below the first peak and half from the area below the second peak .",

    "let us next discuss the charge densities for @xmath144 . in this case",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "6 that the peaks of @xmath179 and @xmath181 are roughly at the same location",
    ". however , at a large distance from these peaks the function @xmath179 possesses a second local maximum .",
    "we found , that the magnetic charge stems mainly from this second local maximum , whereas the contribution from the global maximum is marginal .",
    "this behaviour becomes plausible if we consider the profile of the gauge field function @xmath99 in fig .",
    "for small values of @xmath93 the function @xmath99 is close to one .",
    "consequently , the magnetic charge density is small . for larger values of @xmath93",
    "the function @xmath99 develops a local minimum , this leads to the first peak of @xmath179 .",
    "when @xmath99 approaches again the value one , the function @xmath179 again becomes very small . at large distances",
    "the function @xmath99 decays to its asymptotic value .",
    "this leads to the second maximum of @xmath179 .",
    "however , the magnetic charge density also depends on the higgs field function @xmath95 , and one would expect that the charge density has to be small if @xmath95 is small , i.  e. in the region where the gauge field function possesses its local minimum , see figs .  4a and 4b .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "note , that for @xmath144 the normalization constants of the function @xmath181 is several orders of magnitude larger then the normalization constant of the function @xmath179 .",
    "thus , the monopole charge density at the first peak is indeed very small compared to the baryon charge density .    in analogy to the interpretation of a monopole inside a baryon for large values of @xmath69",
    ", one could interpret the solutions for small values of @xmath69 as a baryon inside a monopole .",
    "however , the gauge field is nontrivial at the location of the baryon and the higgs field is not in the vacuum in this region .",
    "thus the baryon would reside in a nearly symmetric phase .",
    "one may speculate , that this scenario might be interesting in respect to the decay of the baryon .      in most calculations we fixed the parameter @xmath188 .",
    "in view of the discussion in section 2 this needs some clarification .",
    "the interaction term of the chiral matrix with the higgs field was introduced into the model basically for ideological reasons as it fixes the value of chiral function at infinity , @xmath53 = 0 ( say ) .",
    "then we assumed that in the limit @xmath189 the asymptotic value of the chiral function is stil fixed , and that the field configurations behave smoothly .",
    "indeed , we found from our numerical analysis that this is the case and that the assumption is justified .",
    "let us now discuss the case where @xmath19 is finite . as long as @xmath19 is small ,",
    "the dependence of the solutions on the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath18 does not change considerably .",
    "in particular the bifurcation pattern for small values of @xmath69 as shown in figs .  3 persists for small @xmath19 .",
    "the reason is simply that @xmath19 enters the differential equations only as a factor of the higgs field function @xmath95 . in the limit @xmath70 the higgs field function vanishes and",
    "consequently the equations do not depend on @xmath19 in this limit . to discuss the more general case of finite @xmath69",
    "let us assume that for some parameters @xmath190 solutions on the branches @xmath126 , @xmath125 and @xmath127 coexist and form a butterfly in the @xmath191 diagram for @xmath188 .",
    "then the butterfly will persist for small values of @xmath19 . as @xmath19 increases",
    ", the butterfly shrinks in size and disappears at a critical value of @xmath19 , e.  g. @xmath192 for fixed @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "thus , the bifurcation pattern is similar to fig .  3 , if we replace @xmath18 by @xmath69 , @xmath69 by @xmath19 and interchange the role of @xmath126 and @xmath125 .",
    "we now consider the case where @xmath19 becomes very large at fixed parameters @xmath190 . in the limit @xmath195",
    "the potential ( [ vpot ] ) becomes a constraint , which for the spherically symmetric ansatz ( [ phi_an ] ) , ( [ u_an ] ) becomes @xmath196 note , that this constraint can neither be solved by a vanishing higgs field function , @xmath197 , because this violates the boundary condition @xmath198 , nor by a constant chiral function , @xmath199 or @xmath200 , because this violates boundary conditions at the origin or at infinity .",
    "however , there is a third possibility .",
    "if the higgs field function vanishes on the interval @xmath201 $ ] and the chiral function vanishes on the interval @xmath202 $ ] then the function @xmath203 vanishes everywhere .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the field configurations for @xmath204 and for @xmath188 for comparison for fixed parameters @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath143 on the branch @xmath126 .",
    "we observe that the higgs field function @xmath95 is indeed almost zero on the interval @xmath201 $ ] , with @xmath205 , while the chiral function @xmath96 changes continuously from @xmath206 to @xmath207 . on the interval",
    "@xmath202 $ ] the chiral function is almost zero and the higgs field function changes continuously form @xmath208 to its asymptotic value @xmath209 .",
    "the figure suggests that in the limit @xmath210 the derivatives of the functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 will be finite but non - continuous at @xmath211 , whereas the gauge field function remains twice differentiable at @xmath211 .    taking into account the behaviour of the functions for large @xmath19 , we observe from the differential equation for the chiral function @xmath96 ( [ deqs0 ] ) , that the @xmath212 interaction term will be almost zero for @xmath213 . assuming that @xmath95 increases linearly at @xmath211 , we find for large @xmath19 that for @xmath214 the chiral function decays exponentially with the exponent @xmath215 .",
    "hence , we find the following scenario . for @xmath213",
    "the interaction of the higgs field with the chiral field vanishes , whereas for @xmath214 the chiral field becomes increasingly massive .",
    "consequently , the baryon is trapped inside the monopole . on the other hand , because the magnetic charge density is proportional to the higgs field , there will be ( almost ) vanishing monopole density for @xmath213 for large @xmath19 and the monopole is expelled from the baryon .",

    "( [ deqs0 ] ) we determine the eigenvalues of the fluctuation matrix around that solution .",
    "the existence of a negative eigenvalue of a normalizable fluctuation mode indicates that a deformation of the solutions in the direction of this mode lowers its energy .",
