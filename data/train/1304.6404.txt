    "since simulations of high - redshift galaxies suggest that when lyc escapes , it does so through essentially dust - free channels , we will limit the discussion to radiation - bounded nebulae with holes ( fig .",
    "[ dust_geometry]a and c ) . for both of these geometries ,",
    "the effects of small amounts of optical attenuation ( @xmath70 mag ) on positions of galaxies in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram are illustrated in fig ..  [ dust_corrections ] , assuming the @xcite average lmc attenuation law to capture the transport of radiation through dusty regions .    at low @xmath0 , a foreground dust screen ( attenuation vector represented by solid arrow )",
    "has a pronounced effect on @xmath2 but almost no effect on ew(h@xmath2 ) , since the stellar continuum emerging through the screen still dominates the rest - frame uv , while the unattenuated continuum that escapes through the holes remains subdominant at wavelengths close to h@xmath2 . at high @xmath0 ,",
    "the reverse is true : @xmath2 is largely unaffected by dust since the unattenuated stellar uv continuum escaping through the holes dominates over the dust - attenuated continuum , and ew(h@xmath2 ) is lowered due to the increasing importance of stellar h@xmath2 continuum emerging through the holes .",
    "hence , the attenuation vector changes direction and amplitude depending on where in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram one started off .    if the dust is spatially mixed with the ionized gas ( fig .",
    "[ dust_geometry]c ) , the stellar non - ionizing continuum will still suffer @xmath70 mag of attenuation , but the balmer line ratios will reflect a value smaller than this , since part of the attenuation happened prior to photoionization . at fixed @xmath0 , the nebula will also appear fainter due to lyc extinction . here , we model this case by assuming that the star light entering the hii region is attenuated by @xmath76 mag before it has a chance to ionize the gas ( lowering the number of lyc photons that enter the gas by a factor of @xmath77 ) , and apply a further @xmath76 mag correction outside the hii region ( giving a total of @xmath70 mag , as before ) . other ratios of stellar to nebular attenuation can certainly be considered , but this serves to exemplify the ew(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath2 trends . the resulting lyc depletion factor is somewhat lower than suggested by @xcite and @xcite for local hii regions , but similar to that derived by @xcite for low - redshift starburst galaxies .",
    "our procedure gives rise to the dashed attenuation arrows in fig .",
    "[ dust_corrections ] . as in the case of the outer dust screen ,",
    "the @xmath2 slope is reddened more at low @xmath0 than at high @xmath0 , but the overall reduction in nebular emission ( due to lyc extinction ) increases the relative impact of stellar h@xmath2 continuum on the emerging sed and decreases ew(h@xmath2 ) substantially at all @xmath0 .    at fixed @xmath78 ,",
    "the two types of attenuation vectors discussed above have slightly different directions and amplitudes .",
    "moreover , a measurement of the h@xmath2/h@xmath47 balmer decrement will tend to underestimate the overall attenuation whenever lyc photons are lost due to dust extinction , as in the case where ionized gas and dust are mixed . for a given h@xmath2/h@xmath47 ratio , there will therefore be lingering uncertainties in how to correct the position in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram unless the amount of lyc extinction can be assessed .",
    "for example , consider an object observed to lie close to the @xmath56 yr marker on the orange line ( @xmath63 ) in fig .",
    "[ dust_corrections ] . to correct the position of this object for dust effects",
    ", one needs to pick the right attenuation vector , and to move the object in the opposite direction in the diagram .",
    "if the balmer line ratios suggest @xmath70 mag , a correction assuming an outer dust screen would place the object on the green line ( implying @xmath79 ) , whereas a correction assuming mixed gas and dust would still place it on the orange line ( i.e. @xmath63 ) .",
    "these uncertainties are not easy to overcome from observations in the rest - frame uv / optical alone , but supporting observations in the rest - frame mid / far - ir could improve the situation ( as further discussed in sect .",
    "[ ir ] ) .",
    "the possibility that the effective attenuation law may have a more pronounced effect on emission lines than on the far - uv / optical continuum represents yet another complication .",
    "this phenomenon is observed in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is most readily interpreted as due to temporal evolution in the opacity of star - forming regions  the youngest star clusters ( that contribute most of the lyc photons and the nebular emission ) tend to be more strongly affected by dust than the slightly older star clusters , which contribute substantially to the far - uv / optical stellar continuum ) . in principle , this effect could mimic lyc leakage in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram by causing a substantial reduction in ew(h@xmath2 ) but only a modest reddening of @xmath2 .",
    "however , we find that the @xcite attenuation scheme  in which the nebular emission experiences a dust optical depth a factor of @xmath77 times than that of the stars  results in an attenuation vector no more extreme than those already included in fig .  [ dust_corrections ] . in order for a @xmath42 galaxy to be misclassified as an @xmath4 object , one requires both a higher ratio of nebular to stellar dust opacity  as in some of the more extreme objects discussed by @xcite  and substantial nebular attenuation ( @xmath80 mag , as revealed by e.g. the h@xmath81h@xmath47 emission line ratio ) .",

    "<S> the fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath0 ) that escape from @xmath1 galaxies is an important parameter when assessing the role of these objects in the reionization of the universe , but the opacity of the intergalactic medium precludes a direct measurement of @xmath0 for individual galaxies at these epochs . </S>",
    "<S> we argue , that since @xmath0 regulates the impact of nebular emission on the spectra of galaxies , it should nonetheless be possible to indirectly probe @xmath0 well into the reionization epoch . as a first step , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that by combining measurements of the rest - frame uv slope @xmath2 with the equivalent width of the @xmath3 emission line , galaxies with very high lyman continuum escape fractions ( @xmath4 ) should be identifiable up to @xmath5 through spectroscopy with the upcoming james webb space telescope ( jwst ) . by targeting strongly lensed galaxies behind low - redshift galaxy clusters , jwst spectra of sufficiently good quality </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained for @xmath6 galaxies at @xmath7 and for @xmath8 galaxies at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> dust - obscured star formation may complicate the analysis , but supporting observations with alma or the planned spica mission may provide useful constraints on the dust properties of these galaxies . </S>"
