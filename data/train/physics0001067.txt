    "the majority of cooling methods are based on a friction of particles in external electromagnetic fields or in media when the liouville s theorem does not work . only stochastic method of cooling",

    "a friction originating from a media or in the process of emission ( scattering ) of photons by charged particles in external fields leads , under definite conditions , to a damping of amplitudes of both betatron and phase oscillations of these particles when they are captured in buckets of storage rings , i.e. there occurs a three - dimensional cooling of particle beams . in this case particles of a beam loose theirs momentum . at that the friction force is parallel to the particle velocity , and",
    "therefore the momentum losses include both the transverse and longitudinal ones .",
    "longitudinal momentum losses are compensated by a radio frequency accelerating system of the storage ring .",
    "meanwhile the longitudinal momentum of a particle tends to a certain equilibrium .",
    "this is because the rate of the momentum loss of the particle is higher / less than the equilibrium value when this momentum is higher / less than the equilibrium value .",
    "the transverse vertical momentum of particles disappears irreversibly .",
    "such a way the compression of phase - space density for a given ensemble of particles takes place .",
    "the transverse radial and longitudinal particle oscillations are dispersion coupled through energy losses @xcite .",
    "their damping rates can be corrected or redistributed by insertion devices placed at straight sections of storage rings to introduce an additional friction of particles , and by a correction of the ring lattice parameters .",
    "the damping rates of both transverse and longitudinal oscillations can be redistributed by coupling transverse and longitudinal particle oscillations near betatron and synchro - betatron resonances @xcite .    in the case of emission of particles in a laser wave",
    "the radiation friction force appears together with the laser wave pressure force .",
    "friction force is determined by self - fields of the accelerated particles and the pressure force is determined by the electromagnetic fields of the laser wave ( average value of the vector product of the particle velocity and the magnetic field strength of the laser wave which is not equal to zero when the self - force is taken into account ) @xcite .",
    "the total averaged force can be directed both in the same direction , or in the transverse and the opposite directions relative to the average particle velocity .",
    "it depends on the direction of the particle velocity relative to the wave propagation .",

    "both the radiation friction force and the pressure force are directed opposite to the particle velocity .",
    "the process of cooling of particle beams based on friction forces has a classical nature and can be described in the framework of classical electrodynamics .",
    "however , such data as atomic and nuclear levels , oscillator strengths , degeneracy parameter , and so on , which determine the corresponding laser wavelengths , cross - sections of particle interactions and friction forces should be used from quantum mechanics . at the same time",
    ", the excitation of longitudinal and transverse oscillations of particles in storage rings has a quantum nature . in this case the quasi - classical description of excitation of these oscillations can be used @xcite .    in the ordinary three - dimensional cooling ,",
    "the particle beams are cooled under conditions when all particles interact with the external fields or media independent of their energy and amplitudes of betatron oscillations .",
    "insertion devices / targets in this case ( wigglers , laser beams , material media ) overlap the particle beam and are motionless . in this case",
    "the difference in the rates of energy losses of particles of the beam having maximum and minimum energies is not high . that is why the cooling time of the particle beam determined by this difference is high and equal to the time interval , at which particle energy losses in the target are equal to about the two - fold initial energy of the particle . at",

    "cooling of particle beams can be enhanced . in this case the damping time of the particle beams in the longitudinal phase space can be reduced essentially ( in the energy of particle over the energy spread of the particle beam ratio ) if we will use selective interactions of particles of the beam and targets . for this purpose",
    "we have to choose such targets which interact with particles having definite energies or amplitudes of betatron oscillations and do not interact with another particles of the same beam .",
    "for example , target can interact with particles of the energy higher then minimum energy of the beam and do not interact with particles of minimum and lesser energy . in this case",
    "the rate of the energy loss of particles is not increased but the difference in the rates of losses of particles of the beam having maximum and minimum energies will be increased essentially and all particles will be gathered at the minimum energy in a short time ( equal to the time interval , at which a particle looses the energy equal to the initial energy spread of the particle beam ) .    in this paper",

    "both the laser beam and the particle beam are focused to a waist at the center of the straight section of the storage ring . in limits of this region",

    "experiments @xcite confirm this observation .",
    "the same idea is in the three - dimensional scheme of the ionizing cooling of muon beams through dispersion coupling in the wedge - shaped material target .",
    "it was discussed in the paper of d.v.neuffer @xcite . ] .",

    "after that the one dimensional cooling can be used again to decrease the longitudinal emittance of the being cooled ion beam .",
    "the three - dimensional laser cooling of ion beams can be realized by a monochromatic laser beam with accelerating fields of radio frequency cavities as well .",
    "the nature of the transverse cooling by the monochromatic laser beam in the three - dimensional method of cooling does not differ from the case of the broadband laser cooling .",
    "a difference is in conditions of interaction of ion and laser beams . in the case of a broadband laser beam",
    "all ions interact with the laser beam independent of their energies and amplitudes of betatron oscillations . in the case of a monochromatic laser beam",
    "every ion interacts with the laser beam only a part of time , when it passes the ion resonance energy in the process of phase oscillations in a bucket of a storage ring .",
    "that is why it has greater damping time at the same saturation parameter as in the case the broadband laser and the same cooling configuration ( at that the power of the broadband laser is higher ) .",
    "smaller value of the transverse damping time is the advantage of the broadband laser cooling in the case of a three - dimensional laser cooling of ion beams .",
    "experimentally , the version of longitudinal cooling of a bunched non - relativistic beam of @xmath60 ions ( kinetic energy @xmath61 100 kev ) was observed first in the storage ring astrid @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic laser beam co - propagated with the ion beam ( conditions of the ion acceleration ) at scanning of its frequency and using the accelerating system of the storage ring . at such cooling , some degree of the radiative transverse cooling could be observed .",
    "a three - dimensional cooling of electron and proton beams based on the backward compton scattering of laser photons in the dispersion - free straight sections of the storage rings can be used @xcite . in this case",
    "we can use the expressions ( 2.1 ) - ( 2.3 ) if we replace the values @xmath62 , @xmath63 and accept @xmath64 and power @xmath65 of scattered radiation on the energy @xmath66 .",

    "the powers emitted by electron and ion are : @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , ion of higher energy scatter laser photons of lesser energy ! ) . because of this difference we will have correct result for the case of cooling of electron beams if we will choose @xmath64 in ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) @xcite . ] .",
    "the method is identical to that suggested in papers @xcite-@xcite where magnetic wigglers were used instead of laser beams . in this case",
    "the excitation of radial betatron oscillations will take place only through the emission of photons of synchrotron radiation from bending magnets of the ring where the dispersion function differ from zero . at the same time",
    ", the rate of the betatron oscillation damping will be determined by total power emitted both in the form of synchrotron radiation and compton scattering of laser photons .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation emitted by electrons in the process of compton scattering can lead to a significant shortening of damping time and hence equilibrium emittance of stored beams if the power of scattered radiation will be much higher than the power of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the method of the radiative cooling considered in this section is not optimal . the damping time and the emittance of particle beams",
    "can be shortened significantly by using a selective interaction of particles and laser beams .",
    "below we shall consider one- and two - dimensional enhanced cooling schemes based on selective interactions of particle beams and targets .",
    "in the case of ordinary longitudinal cooling all particles of a beam loose their energy in storage rings such a way that the ratio of a difference in rates of the energy loss of particles having maximum and minimum energies is small . the small difference in rates in comparison with the rates of",
    "the energy loss of particles leads to a small relative velocity of bringing closer of their energies .",
    "that is why the damping time of longitudinal emittance of the particle beam is high .",
    "it is determined by about two - fold loss of the initial particle energy in the external fields or targets under conditions of recovering of the energy in the radio frequency system of the storage ring .",
    "introduction of special damping magnets ( wigglers ) or wedge - shaped targets can lead to decreasing of damping time of particles in the longitudinal phase space .",
    "but such insertion devices simultaneously , according to robinson s damping criterion , lead to increase of damping time of the particles in the transverse radial phase space or to untidamping @xcite .",
    "this is because of the robinson s theorem is valid for the case of linear systems , when target overlap the particle beam completely and when longitudinal and transverse betatron oscillations are dispersion coupled .",
    "the damping time of the particle beam in the longitudinal phase space can be reduced essentially ( in the energy over the energy spread ratio ) if we will use selective interactions of a particle beam and a target when only a part of particles of the beam interact with the target . in this case",
    "we have to choose such targets and conditions of interaction , when targets interact with particles having definite energies or amplitudes of betatron oscillation and do not interact with another particles of the same beam .",
    "for example , we can switch on interaction between target and particles of the beam having maximum energy first , extend in time continuously the interaction with particles of lesser energy and switch off the interaction at the energy equal to minimum energy of particles in the beam .",
    "then we can repeat this manipulation and gather all particles of the beam at minimal energy .",
    "such a way we will realize the cooling of a particle beam in the longitudinal plane . in this case the rate of the energy loss by a particle must depend mainly on the position of its instantaneous orbit and must not depend on the deviation of the particle from this orbit because of the betatron oscillations .",
    "the damping time of the particle beam will be determined by the condition in which a particle having maximum energy will loose the energy equal to the energy spread of the being cooled beam .    the selectivity can be achieved in different ways . among them note a method based on a resonant and energy threshold interaction ( @xmath0 pair production , interaction of ions with a broadband laser beam having sharp frequency edges ) , a time dependent degree of overlapping in the radial direction of a being cooled particle beam and a moving target .",
    "we can see a similarity between enhanced longitudinal and stochastic cooling of particle beams in the individual manipulations in turns with parts of particle beams which are differ by definite parameters ( energies , amplitudes of betatron oscillations ) in the first case and individual particles in the second case .",
    "however this is only similarity .",
    "the reason of the enhanced cooling is in a friction and the selective interaction of particles and transversely moving target ( the degree of overlapping of the target and particle beam depends on time , particles of the energy lesser then minimum one does not interact with the target , the duration of interaction is proportional to the energy deviation of the particle from the minimum initial energy of particles in the beam ) .",
    "the enhancing effect is possible only in the case when the cooled beam occupies a small lauer in the phase space .",
    "it is proportional to the ratio of the minimum energy of the beam to its energy spread .",
    "the enhanced cooling would be absent when the particles of the beam where distributed in the range of energies from zero to maximum one .",
    "below we will discuss some possible enhanced schemes of cooling .",
    "a typical version of one - dimensional laser cooling of ion beams is based on the resonant interaction of unbunched ion beam and homogeneous monochromatic laser beam overlapping the ion one in the transverse direction .",
    "the initial frequency of the laser beam ( photon energy ) in this version of cooling is chosen so that photons interact first with the most high energy ions . then the frequency is scanning ( frequency chirp ) in the high frequency direction , and ions of a lower energy begin to interact with the laser beam and decrease their energy .",
    "the scanning of the laser frequency is stopped when all ions are gathered at the minimum energy of ions in the beam .    the resonance ion energy @xmath71 , where @xmath72/2(\\omega _ { tr}/\\omega _ l)$ ] is the resonance relativistic factor .",
    "the initial resonance energy is above the equilibrium energy of the storage ring , and is higher than that corresponding to the maximum ion energy in the beam .",
    "minimum ion energy must be higher than the equilibrium one as well ( the accelerating rf electric field strength will be switched on after cooling ) .",
    "the rate of scanning must correspond to the condition @xmath73 , where @xmath65 corresponds to the power of radiation scattered by an ion at resonance conditions .",
    "the cooling time is equal to the time interval , at which the particle with maximum initial energy emits the electromagnetic radiation energy equal to the initial energy spread @xmath74 of the ion beam , and the energy spread of the cooled beam is determined by either the average energy of the scattered photons @xmath75 or the natural line width of the laser beam :      this time is @xmath77 times lower than that in the case of the three - dimensional cooling .",
    "this is the consequence of the selective resonance interaction of photon and ion beams in the one - dimensional method when ions of the energy higher than minimum initial energy of the beam interact with the laser beam .",
    "the considered method is one of the possible one - dimensional ion cooling methods gev / nucleon ) storage rings . ] .",
    "the first similar method was used for cooling of non - relativistic ion beams @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "relativistic version of such a method was developed in @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional laser cooling of bunched ion beams by monochromatic laser beam is possible with accelerating fields of radiofrequency cavities ( see section 2.1 ) @xcite .",
    "the broadband laser beam with a sharp low frequency edge can be used as well . in this case",
    "the edge frequency must have such a value that only ions with energies above the equilibrium one can be excited @xcite . to gather the cooled ion beam into short bunches the radiofrequency accelerating cavity",
    "should be switched on adiabatically .",
    "one - dimensional laser cooling is highly efficient in the longitudinal direction , but rather difficult in the transverse direction unless a special longitudinal - radial coupling mechanism is applied ( synchro - betatron resonance @xcite , dispersion coupling @xcite ) .",
    "moreover this is the resonance method of cooling .",
    "it can be applied to cooling of only complicated ions . in papers @xcite-@xcite",
    "a three - dimensional radiative ion cooling method is proposed and considered above .",
    "nevertheless , the quest for new more efficient enhanced three - dimensional cooling methods remains vital for cooling of electrons , protons , muons and both not fully stripped and fully stripped high current ion beams .",
    "below we will discuss a two - dimensional method of cooling when alternative targets and selective interactions are used .",
    "we consider the process of change of amplitudes of betatron oscillations @xmath78 and positions of instantaneous orbits @xmath79 in the process of the energy loss of particles in targets when the rf accelerating system of the storage ring is switched off @xcite .",
    "the internal target @xmath80 at the first stage and external target @xmath81 of constant thickness at the second one will be moved in the transverse directions in turn ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "they can be located in different positions along the way of the particle beam in the storage ring .",
    "every stage of cooling can be used in combination with another schemes of enhanced cooling or with schemes of the emittance exchange in the longitudinal and transverse planes .",
    "the velocity of a particle instantaneous orbit @xmath82 depends on the distance @xmath83 between the target and the instantaneous orbit , and on the amplitude of particle oscillations .",
    "when the instantaneous orbit of a particle enters the target at the depth higher than the amplitude of the particle oscillations then its velocity @xmath84 is maximum one by the value and negative .",
    "the velocity @xmath85 is given by the material target thickness or the intensity and the length of the interaction region of the laser target .    in the general case particles do not interact with the target every turn .",
    "that is why the velocity @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the probability of a particle to cross the target .",
    "the probability @xmath88 is determined by the ratio of the period of betatron oscillations of a particle to a part of the period which is determined by conditions : 1 ) the deviation of the particle from the instantaneous orbit is greater than the distance between the orbit and the target ( @xmath89 ) , 2 ) the deviation is directed to the target .",
    "it can be presented in the form @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , labels 1 , 2 correspond to first and second targets used at first and second stages of cooling accordingly .    in the approximation",
    "when random processes of excitation of betatron oscillations of particles in a target of a storage ring can be neglected the behavior of the amplitudes of betatron oscillations of these particles is determined by the equation @xmath94 or @xmath95 ( see appendix a ) , where @xmath96 is the particle deviation from the instantaneous orbit averaged through the range of phases @xmath97 of betatron oscillations where the particle cross the target . the value @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , signs @xmath100 and @xmath101 are related to the first and second stages of cooling .",
    "thus the cooling processes at the first and second stages are determined by the system of equations        these equations are valid both for one and for a set of thin foils of the same total thickness , located at different azimuths and at definite depths of storage rings .",
    "this system of equations permits to investigate the main processes connected with cooling of particle beams .",
    "let the initial instantaneous particle orbits be distributed in a region @xmath108 and initial amplitudes of particle radial betatron oscillations @xmath109 be distributed in a region @xmath110 relative to their instantaneous orbits , where @xmath111 is the location of the middle instantaneous orbit of particles of the beam ; @xmath112 , the mean - root square deviation of instantaneous orbits from the middle one .",

    ", an internal target @xmath80 ( laser beam or a material medium target ) is located at the orbit region ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , where @xmath123 is the target width ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the internal edge of the target has the form of a flat sharp boundary . at the initial step the target overlaps only a part of the particle beam so that particles with largest initial amplitudes of betatron oscillations interact with the target .",
    "the interaction takes place only at the moment when the particle deviation caused by betatron oscillations is directed toward the target and has approximately the maximum initial amplitude @xmath124 .    in this case immediately after the interaction and loss of energy the position of a particle and the direction of its momentum remain the same , but the instantaneous orbit is displaced inward in the direction of the target .",
    "the radial coordinate of the instantaneous orbit and the amplitude of betatron oscillations are decreased to the same value owing to the dispersion coupling .",
    "after every interaction the position of the instantaneous orbit will approach the target more and more and the amplitude of betatron oscillations is coming smaller until it will reach some small value when the instantaneous orbit will reach the edge of the target . up to this moment the instantaneous orbit go in the direction to the target , but the particle depth of dipping do not move forward deeper into the target .    at the moment when the instantaneous orbit of the particle enter the target the amplitude of the particle betatron oscillations",
    "is much decreased .",
    "the instantaneous orbit will continue its movement in the target with constant velocity @xmath84 if the target is homogeneous one , has constant thickness and when its depth of dipping in the target is greater then the amplitude of particle betatron oscillations .",

    ", the latter must be removed or the particle beam must be returned to the initial position for a short time . after this , all particles will have small amplitudes of betatron oscillations and increased energy spread .    here",
