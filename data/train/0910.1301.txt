    "the monge  ampre equation ( mae ) @xmath0 is encountered in many areas of numerical analysis and physics , ranging from image processing @xcite to cosmology @xcite . here",
    "the subscripts @xmath1 denote derivatives in the respective spatial variables ; @xmath2 is the hessian of @xmath3 , i.e. , the matrix comprised of second derivatives of @xmath3 . existence and regularity of its solutions was considered in @xcite .",
    "various strategies were proposed for its numerical solution .",
    "a provably convergent method for solving the dirichlet problem for the two - dimensional mae in bounded convex domains was presented in @xcite .",
    "it is directly linked to the geometric interpretation of the equation that had given an opportunity to demonstrate existence of weak solutions @xcite .",
    "however , the actual numerical examples in @xcite have just up to 25 grid points , which is clearly insufficient to establish the practical feasibility of the method .",
    "grid required about 15 minutes of a pentium 4 processor .",
    "this problem of geometric optics can be recast as the monge  kantorovich mass transfer problem , reducing to a pde of the mae type , see @xcite . ]",
    "the mae can be recast as a minimisation problem ; application of algorithms for saddle - point optimisation to a two - dimensional mae was considered in @xcite , and least - squares minimisation was advocated in @xcite .",
    "efficient methods for solution of the discrete optimal transportation problem were developed for application to cosmological problems @xcite .",
    "it may be perceived that discrete methods correspond well to the physics of mass transportation in the universe  after all , galaxies , as observed by astronomers , are clearly well - localised , discrete objects ! this argument , however , becomes less persuading , when one recalls that visible matter constitutes only a very small fraction of different , `` dark '' kinds of matter , whose density distribution is supposed to be continuous ( as opposed to a nearly discrete distribution in clusters of the visible matter ) .    in another group of methods",
    "the mae is treated as a generic nonlinear partial differential equation .",
    "application of galerkin s and finite element methods to a regularised mae was considered in @xcite .",
    "a pseudospectral newton s algorithm was reported to perform well for a mae in @xmath4 with a smooth r.h.s .",
    "however , when we implemented this algorithm for a three - dimensional mae , we found that it failed to converge , unless the r.h.s .",
    "was a smooth slowly varying function .",
    "this is consistent with the observation @xcite that newton s method , applied to equations equivalent to the mae , is useful to improve an approximate solution only if the approximation is accurate enough , and easily fails otherwise .",
    "two methods for numerical solution of a dirichlet problem for an elliptic mae in a two - dimensional convex region @xmath5 are examined in @xcite .",
    "the first one employs a finite - difference discretisation of the equation ; it is advocated for application to the mae with a possibly singular solution .",
    "the second one is an iterative method for the mae in the form of a fixed point problem @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 denotes the inverse laplacian ) ; it is claimed to perform better , when the solution is regular ( i.e. , belongs to the sobolev space @xmath8 ) .",

    "the nature of the problem solved in @xcite required only a modest accuracy of solutions , discrepancies the order of @xmath9 being acceptable .",
    "examples of computations of such moderately accurate solutions illustrating the scalability of the algorithm with respect to the employed spatial resolution were provided _",
    "_    in sections 2 - 4 we derive three alternative forms of : the `` second - order divergence '' form , the fourier integral form and the `` convolution '' form , which , to the best of our knowledge , were never presented in the literature before .",

    "the methods and results of their test applications are presented in section 6 ; the monge - ampre problem of the cosmological type , which we use to test our algorithms , is presented in section 5 , after a short statement of the cosmological reconstruction problem . in the concluding",
    "remarks we briefly discuss some open questions .",
    "we note that the mae s of various kinds are considered in the literature . for the mae arising in the mass transportation problem , typically the r.h.s .  of depends on the gradient of the unknown function ( this form of the equation can be found in the original memoir by ampre @xcite ) . in the theory of pde s ,",
    "usually one considers the mae with a known r.h.s .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "the mae of this kind arises in the reconstruction of the early universe ( see discussion at the beginning of section 5 ) . since this cosmological problem is the main original motivation for our work , we restrict our discussion to the case of the `` mathematician s '' mae .",
    "however , a straightforward reformulation of our algorithms makes them applicable for the case of the r.h.s .  depending on the unknown function .",
    "the divergence form of the mae , in which the l.h.s .  of the equation is represented as a sum of the _ first _ derivatives of certain quantities , is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we derive a representation of the l.h.s .  of the mae as a sum of _ second _ derivatives , which we call the second - order divergence form of the mae .",
    "consider a fourier integral solution @xmath10 to the mae in @xmath11 .",
    "substituting the integral into and using the identity for @xmath12 matrices @xmath13 where each of the indices @xmath14 takes the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the unit antisymmetric tensor of rank @xmath17 , we find @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 here @xmath24 denotes a @xmath12 matrix comprised of @xmath17 columnar vectors @xmath25 .",

    "`` second - order divergence '' form _ of in @xmath11 : @xmath27 equivalence of and is now easily established directly : using the standard rule for differentiation of the products in the l.h.s .  of , we render it as a sum of products of derivatives of @xmath3 .",
    "third - order derivatives enter such a product only in pairs of the form @xmath28 , and hence all products involving third - order derivatives cancel out due to antisymmetry of the tensors @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , all terms involving fourth - order derivatives cancel out .",
    "consequently , each term in the l.h.s .  of gives",
    "rise to a single term @xmath30 , and hence the sum is the determinant of the hessian of @xmath3 , as required .",
    "this form has an interesting consequence .",
    "suppose , for the sake of simplicity , that a space - periodic solution @xmath31 is sought .",
    "let @xmath32 be a smooth function with a finite support ( in this context such @xmath32 are called test functions ) .",
    "multiplying the mae by @xmath32 and _ twice _ integrating by parts each term in the sum , we obtain by virtue of @xmath33 as usual in the theory of partial differential equations , a weak solution to , @xmath3 , can be defined as a function satisfying the integral identity for any test function @xmath32 .",
    "( other definitions of weak solutions to the mae are natural : generalised solutions obtained by geometric constructions @xcite and the so - called viscosity solutions @xcite ; the two definitions are equivalent @xcite . )",
    "commonly ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , only _",
    "one _ integration by parts is performed in this integral identity .",
    "our form is advantageous in that a lesser regularity of the weak solution is required for to be well - defined .",
    "the following argument illustrates this for @xmath34 : for any @xmath3 from the sobolev space @xmath35 the integrals in the l.h.s .  of are well - defined ( because by the sobolev embedding theorem this implies @xmath36 and hence @xmath37 ) .",
    "by contrast , integrals in the similar identity obtained by just a single integration by parts are _ not _ well - defined for @xmath38 .",
    "( note that a viscosity solution for fully nonlinear second - order equations is only required to be continuous @xcite . )",
    "in the monge  ampre  kantorovich approach to the cosmological reconstruction problems @xcite , the mae arises for the potential of the inverse lagrangian map , in which the function @xmath39 is a ratio between matter density at the current epoch and at the much earlier epoch of matter - radiation decoupling ( at the earlier epoch , the distribution is very close to uniform ) ; thus , @xmath40 .    here",
    ", we consider a problem in which the spatial mean of @xmath39 is positive .",
    "note that for odd @xmath17 , if @xmath41 , the change of the unknown function @xmath42 reverses the sign of @xmath39 and @xmath43 admits the desirable sign ( here @xmath44 denotes space averaging : @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the volume of the ball @xmath47 of radius @xmath48 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 and @xmath39 have the same spatial periodicity ; integration of over a periodicity cell @xmath49 then yields @xmath50 which is incompatible with @xmath51 .",
    "thus we assume henceforth @xmath52 where @xmath53 has the periodicity of @xmath39 and a zero spatial mean ( this being just a normalisation ) , and @xmath54 is a constant",
    ". substitution of into and integration over a periodicity cell yields @xmath55 to derive this , note that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the kronecker symbol , and hence the derivatives of @xmath53 in the l.h.s .  of are present only in @xmath58 and a linear combination of minors of smaller sizes of the hessian of @xmath53 . by the algebraic transformation presented in the previous section",
    "each such minor can be converted into a sum of second derivatives of products of @xmath53 with its second derivatives .",
    "thus the spatial mean of the l.h.s .  of over any periodicity cell , and hence the mean defined by , does not involve @xmath53 and is equal to @xmath59 .    in a more general formulation ,",
    "we seek a solution satisfying and @xmath60 , assuming that @xmath39 and @xmath53 can be represented as fourier integrals : @xmath61 @xmath62 ( if the problem , defined by , and , is considered for space - periodic @xmath39 and @xmath53 , integrals in wave vectors in what follows are replaced by the respective fourier sums . )",
    "eq .   is equivalent to @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes a unit vector in the direction of @xmath66 .",
    "our immediate goal is to derive a similar expression for the terms in of lower orders in @xmath53 .",
    "the term of order @xmath67 is @xmath68 ( here the sum @xmath69 is over all subsets @xmath70 of cardinality @xmath67 ) @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the sum of squares of all minors of rank @xmath67 , @xmath76 obtained by crossing out rows of numbers @xmath77 from the @xmath78 matrix @xmath79 comprised of @xmath67 columnar vectors @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the problem is reduced after the substitution to the system of integral equations , which we call the _ fourier integral form _ of the problem and : @xmath81 @xmath82 which is now stated in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath83 of the laplacian of the unknown function @xmath53 .",
    "equations are valid for all @xmath84 ; the respective equation for @xmath85 is .    if the r.h.s .",

    "is reduced to a single term for @xmath88 in the sum @xmath89 .      in this subsection",
    "we establish bounds @xmath91 provided all vectors @xmath92 have a unit norm .",
    "these bounds will play a crucial rle for our numerical algorithm .",
    "addition to a column @xmath92 of any linear combination of columns @xmath93 for @xmath94 does not change the value of any minor @xmath95 . using the gram ",

    "hence @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the angle between @xmath92 and the subspace spanned by @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , @xmath107    we denote @xmath108 and @xmath109 the transpose of @xmath110 .",
    "the identity @xcite @xmath111 ( which does not require orthogonality of @xmath112 ) can be easily proved using the formula @xmath113 we enlarge the set @xmath112 by vectors @xmath97 for @xmath114 to a complete orthonormal basis in @xmath11 .",

    "_    @xmath137 . under the same conditions , the following inequalities are satisfied for all @xmath136 : @xmath138 @xmath139 where it is denoted @xmath140 furthermore , if @xmath141 then iterations converge to a solution to , which is unique in the ball .",
    "the proof is elementary : inequalities  stem from the bounds . by the contraction mapping principle , inequalities ",
    "imply convergence of iterations in the norms of @xmath142 and @xmath143 in the space of fourier coefficients , yielding a solution satisfying .",
    "evidently , equations and , where equality is assumed instead of the inequalities , have positive solutions for any @xmath17 .",
    "( for instance , @xmath144 for @xmath145 . )",
    "if for the chosen values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 holds true , @xmath146 and the inequality is strict , then all conditions of the theorem become satisfied for a slightly smaller value of  @xmath129 .",
    "note that in view of @xmath147 and hence implies @xmath40 everywhere .",
    "consequently , our theorem is mostly of interest as a statement about convergence of iterations .",
    "existence of weak solutions was proved by geometric methods in @xcite for the mae with an arbitrary positive r.h.s .  in a compact convex domain .",
    "although our theorem is significantly weaker because of the strong restrictions on the r.h.s . , we have proved it for a non - compact domain  the entire space .",
    "following the same algebraic ideas , the mae can be partially `` integrated '' .",
    "we again use the fourier transform of @xmath53 : @xmath148 let @xmath149 where @xmath150 @xmath151 that these conditions can be enforced , is elementary for @xmath84 ; the case @xmath85 is not problematic , because @xmath152 .",
    "then @xmath153 is a real - valued function .",
    "( for a given @xmath53 it is not uniquely defined . )",
    "let us render the term of order @xmath67 in @xmath53 in the l.h.s .  of in the terms of @xmath154 employing the expression , , and the `` identity '' @xmath155 ( as usual understood in the sense of generalised functions )",

    "therefore , the problem is equivalent , after the substitution and , to @xmath165 we call this integral equation the _ `` convolution '' form _ of the mae .",
    "since it does not involve second - order derivatives , it may prove useful for development of an iterative algorithm for numerical solution of the problem defined by , and , which involves suitable transformations of the spatial variable .",
    "if the r.h.s .",
    "of is zero - mean , the mae also admits the convolution form , where @xmath166 , the l.h.s .  is reduced to a single term for @xmath88 in the sum @xmath167 , and @xmath168 in the definition of @xmath169 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath3 .",
    "one important area of application of the mae is the reconstruction of the dynamical history of the universe from present observations of the spatial distribution of masses ( galaxies , clusters , including their dark - matter components ) .",
    "let us briefly recall the background .",
    "peebles was the first to propose that , from the sole knowledge of the current positions of galaxies ( from the local group which includes our own galaxy ) without knowledge of their ( proper ) velocities , reconstruction of the full dynamical history is a meaningful goal @xcite .",
    "indeed , the very strong constraint on the distribution of masses at the epoch of decoupling  which has to be almost uniform  makes reconstruction a possibly well - posed two - point boundary problem that can then be solved by variational techniques .",
    "in fact , using convexity techniques , a theorem of uniqueness of reconstruction was proved in @xcite , using the euler  poisson equations , which describes the dynamics of matter on sufficiently large scales ( of the order of a few million light years ) . in practice , reconstruction on such scales was done so far via the monge  ampre  kantorovich ( mak ) method @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which assumes that the lagrangian map from initial to current mass locations is the gradient of a convex potential .",
    "this holds exactly for the zeldovich approximation @xcite ( in which the equation for the velocity of matter reduces to the inviscid burgers equation with a zero r.h.s . , and",
    "hence the peculiar velocities remain constant along trajectories of point masses ) and also for its refinement , the first - order lagrangian perturbation approximation @xcite .",
    "it is then easy , using mass conservation , to derive a mae for the potential of the inverse lagrangian map ( the latter is the legendre  fenchel transform of the potential of the direct map ) . by a theorem of brenier @xcite",
    "the mae becomes a monge  kantorovich mass transportation problem with quadratic cost which , after discretisation , can be solved by optimisation techniques ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the r.h.s .  of the mae is equal to the ratio of densities at the present and initial positions .",
    "thus , if the initial density was not uniformly distributed , we would have to solve the mae with the r.h.s .",
    "depending on the gradient of the unknown potential . however , at the epoch of decoupling ( about 380 thousand years after the big bang ) the density of matter was close to uniform , which implies a significant simplification of the mae to be solved : its r.h.s .",
    "is known .    here",
    "we explore for the first time the possibility of directly solving the three - dimensional mae without discretisation on a toy model with a cosmological flavour .",
    "we assume that the dimension of space is @xmath145 , and the r.h.s .  of the mae has the following structure : @xmath170 the function describes mass distribution for @xmath171 `` objects '' , which are `` localised '' , if the value of the parameter @xmath172 is small compared to the distance between objects . in the cosmological context galaxies or clusters of galaxies",
    "can be regarded as such objects ; then @xmath173 describes the _ total _ distribution of mass of both visible matter and dark matter , in which the galaxies are embedded .",
    "although observations attest , that the distribution of visible matter in galaxies is clearly discontinuous , it is astrophysically sound to expect that the distribution of all types of matter is smooth due to the prevailing smoothness of the dark matter .",
    "we assume that objects have density distributions with a gaussian shape : @xmath174 the @xmath175-th object of mass @xmath176 is located at @xmath177 . all @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath177 are independent of the small parameter @xmath180 .",
    "we will be seeking a solution with a space - periodic @xmath53 to the monge  ampre problem , where a space - periodic r.h.s .",
    "@xmath181 is the sum of `` clones '' of over all periodicity cells . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the total mass is normalised : @xmath182 thus implies @xmath166 in .",
    "it is instructive to consider particular solutions to this monge  ampre problem .      in spherical coordinates",
    "centred at @xmath177 , becomes , for spherically symmetric @xmath3 and @xmath39 , @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "this equation has an obvious solution @xmath185 whose first derivatives are uniformly bounded : @xmath186 the second derivatives are @xmath187 : @xmath188 this estimate follows from the following inequalities : + @xmath189 @xmath190 ; + @xmath189 for @xmath191 , @xmath192 is uniformly bounded and @xmath193 for some positive constant @xmath194 and @xmath195 ; + @xmath189 for @xmath196 , @xmath197 is uniformly bounded and @xmath198 for some constant @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath201 is larger than a positive constant , @xmath202 , and hence all second derivatives of @xmath3 are uniformly bounded outside any sphere of a fixed radius .",
    "the properties of the solution discussed in this subsection are implied just by a fast decay of @xmath39 at infinity and the spherical symmetry of the r.h.s . ; the assumption that the profile is gaussian is unnecessary .",
    "a solution for @xmath203 objects can be expected to admit a power series expansion @xmath204 where ( by analogy with ) each @xmath205 and its first derivatives are @xmath206 , and the second derivatives are @xmath187",
    ".    naively one could expect interaction of localised objects to be asymptotically unimportant , and hence to obtain in the leading order the sum of individual one - object solutions : @xmath207 here @xmath208 is the one - object solution for the @xmath175-th object .",
    "let us inspect , to what extent such a conjecture might be true .",
    "consider a neighbourhood of an object @xmath209 . in the leading order , the l.h.s .",
    "of is @xmath210 .",
    "substitution of into the determinant yields a sum of triple products of second derivatives of various @xmath211 .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , for @xmath212 each second derivative of @xmath211 is @xmath206 in this neighbourhood ( the distance between the objects @xmath175 and @xmath209 is a fixed positive constant ) .",
    "thus , only triple products of second derivatives of @xmath213 contribute terms of the leading order , @xmath214 , the one of the l.h.s .",
    "these products constitute @xmath215 and thus match the term @xmath216 in the r.h.s .",
    "nonlinear interaction of pairs of solutions for individual objects is at a lower order , @xmath217 , and that of triplets of one - object solutions - still weaker , @xmath187 .",
    "hence , after the finite sum is substituted into the mae , the highest order terms do cancel out , and in this respect the naive conjecture is confirmed .",
    "nevertheless , the one - cell solution does not represent the leading order term of the solution to the problem at hand . to see this",
    ", note that at large distances exhibits a linear growth in @xmath218 , and not a quadratic one , as the form of the solution requires .",
    "furthermore , after subtraction of the quadratic profile @xmath219 , the remaining part @xmath53 must be space - periodic , which is clearly not the case for .",
    "we can not use to construct a global solution conformant with this periodicity requirement by the procedure , used to obtain the periodic r.h.s .",
    "@xmath181 from the individual density profiles , because the sum of periodically distributed `` clones '' of one - cell solutions is infinite .",
    "moreover , for such hypothetical space - periodic sum there would be infinitely many pairwise interactions between objects yielding products of the order @xmath217 ; hence , even if the sum of such products is finite , it will not necessarily remain @xmath217 .",
    "we observe that the pairwise interaction does not become weaker when the distance between the interacting objects grows .",
    "thus , even in the high - contrast limit the solution that we are seeking does not reduce to individual interactions between objects ; their interaction is essentially collective , which makes it hard to predict the structure of the solution .",
    "in this section we present two iterative algorithms for numerical solution of the space - periodic monge  ampre problem .",
    "one version ( aicdm ) , employing numerical improvement of convexity and discrepancy minimisation stabilising the iterative process , is suitable for computation of solutions for everywhere positive right - hand sides @xmath39 ( see subsection 6.4 ) .",
    "another one ( acpdm ) , involving continuation in parameter and discrepancy minimisation , does not require this condition to be satisfied ( see subsection 6.2 ) .",
    "they both rely on the basic algorithm for iterative solution of a fixed point problem for the mae ( see subsection 6.1 ) .",
    "test applications of the two algorithms are considered in subsections 6.3 and 6.4 .",
    "we assume @xmath220 , however , reformulation of acpdm for the case of a zero - mean space - periodic r.h.s .",
    "is straightforward .",
    "if the amplitude of fluctuation of @xmath39 is small compared to the mean ,  more precisely , if is satisfied ,  the theorem ( see subsection 3.3 ) establishes existence of a solution to , that is a perturbation of @xmath221 . if , in addition , holds true , the theorem guarantees that iterations defined by converge to the laplacian of the perturbation ; this offers an algorithm for numerical solution of the mae .",
    "if either of the conditions or are violated ( which is the practically interesting case ) , iterations do not necessarily converge .",
    "different algorithms are necessary , taking this into account .",
    "suppose the kernels @xmath90 in are frozen and take constant values @xmath222 , respectively .",
    "then the new system of equations can be easily solved , since it is the fourier form of the polynomial equation @xmath223 in the physical space .",
    "this observation suggests the following algorithm .",
    "we express in the terms of @xmath224 as @xmath225 where @xmath226 and implement iterations @xmath227 in the physical space .",
    "the applicability of this algorithm depends crucially on the choice of the coefficients @xmath222 . in view of the positivity and the bounds for the kernels , we impose @xmath228 furthermore",
    ", it seems practical to set @xmath229 because for @xmath230 the linear in @xmath53 term is treated exactly , @xmath231 and the median values of @xmath90 for @xmath232 minimise the ranges of the kernels @xmath233 in . since for the coefficients",
    "@xmath234 the l.h.s .  of `` captures '' the nonlinear behaviour of the l.h.s .  of , the algorithm has chances to converge .",
    "however , for the extreme values of @xmath90 the values of the kernels in are as large as the respective medians , and therefore convergence of iterations , is not guaranteed .",
    "at least two strategies can be proposed for setting the value of @xmath235 ( which is a free parameter in the sense that is not required to be satisfied for @xmath85 ) : + @xmath128 . at each iteration @xmath235",
