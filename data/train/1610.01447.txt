    "supersolid , a homogeneous coexistence of superfluidity and crystalline order , has been the central focus for researchers for a number of decades , since its theoretical prediction @xcite . in 2004 kim and",
    "chan@xcite claimed the experimental discovery of supersolidity in @xmath4he , however the results are still controversial .",
    "recent experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices@xcite have provoked interest in examining these systems as potential candidates for realizing this new state of matter . for quite sometime , although there existed many theoretical predictions of supersolids in bosonic systems with various kinds of interactions @xcite , supersolid state was produced experimentally only recently@xcite .",
    "an interesting class of materials are the valence disproportionated materials , where the same ion can show two different oxidation states@xcite",
    ". one important member of this class is @xmath5 where the @xmath6 ion , with the electronic configuration @xmath74f^{14}5d^{10}6s^2 6p^3}$ ] , displays @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) valence states , skipping the intermediate @xmath12 valence state .",
    "pure @xmath5 is an insulator with alternate @xmath9 and @xmath11 ions forming a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) , which can be thought of as a system with hcbs occupying alternate sites .",
    "furthermore , coexistence of superconductivity and cdw has also been reported in potassium - doped barium bismuthate ( @xmath13)@xcite . more interestingly , @xmath5 assumes perovskite structure with a @xmath14 octahedra , having the @xmath6 at the center of the 6 surrounding @xmath15 atoms .",
    "since two adjacent octahedra share one oxygen atom , the breathing mode becomes cooperative in nature .",
    "moreover , the evidence of strong electron - phonon interaction for pure @xmath5 is clear from the observation of @xmath16 change in the @xmath17 bond length@xcite .",
    "because only the @xmath18 electrons are responsible for the transport properties , @xmath5 can be described as a one - band 3d cooperative breathing mode ( cbm ) model .",
    "understanding charge stripes in high-@xmath19 cuprate superconductors is still an open question , although there are some theoretical suggestions @xcite .",
    "the compound @xmath20 ( lsno ) is not a superconductor , but is isostructural with the cuprate superconductor @xmath21 ( lsco ) and shows striped phase at @xmath22 hole doping .",
    "therefore , the striped phase in lsno has been of immense interest to the researchers for quite some time with the hope that the understanding of lsno striped phase will offer insights to the nature of the high-@xmath19 cuprate superconductors .",
    "in contrast to the stripes in cuprates , which can be described by purely electronic model @xcite , the diagonal stripes in nickelates need the involvement of jahn - teller ( jt ) interactions to be described properly @xcite . since only one type of orbital ( i.e. , either @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) is occupied at a particular electron filling - fraction , the relevant physics of lsno is essentially dominated by two - dimensional cbm .",
    "the main motivation behind this paper is to understand what kind of interaction terms are responsible for various kinds of cdw , as well as the coexistence ( competition ) of ( between ) cdw and superfluidity .",
    "inspired by the above - mentioned real systems , we study a system of hcbs governed by 2d cbm .",
    "though , instead of electrons , we consider hcbs as the constituent particles of the system , our study does shed some light on the charge ordering of electrons as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ eff_hamiltonian ] , we derive an effective hamiltonian of the system using a perturbative treatment . next , in sec .",
    "[ numerical_calc ] we briefly describe the numerical procedure , as well as the quantities used in our study .",
    "then , we discuss the results in sec .",
    "[ results ] , followed by a comparison with experimental observations in sec . [ comparison ] .",
    "finally , in sec . [ conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional model of hcbs depicted in fig .",
    "[ 2d_cbm_fig ] .",
    "the hcbs interact with the in - plane ( xy ) oxygen atoms via cbm , whereas the nature of the interaction is non - cooperative in the case of the out - of - plane oxygen atoms in the z - direction .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xmath25 , where the hopping term @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the destruction(creation ) operator of a hcb at the hopping site @xmath29 .",
    "the second term @xmath30 in the hamiltonian , which represents the hcb - phonon interaction , has the form @xmath31,\\label{hcb - ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",
    "the terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the displacement of the oxygen atom that is next to the @xmath29-th hopping site and in the positive x- and y - directions , respectively ; here , @xmath35 is the mass of oxygen atom .",
    "the relative displacement of the two out - of - plane oxygens next to the @xmath29-th site couples to the hcb at @xmath29-th site and is denoted by @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the reduced mass of the oxygen pairs . the expressions @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the first and second term of eq .",
    "( [ hcb - ph ] ) take care of the cooperative hcb - phonon interaction along x- and y - directions , respectively . in the third term , note that we have only @xmath40 because of the non - cooperative nature of the hcb - phonon interaction along the z - direction .",
    "furthermore , the last term in the hamiltonian ( i.e. , the lattice term @xmath41 ) , representing simple harmonic oscillators , is of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 .    to produce an effective polaronic hamiltonian , we need to modify the usual lang - firsov transformation@xcite so as to take into account the cooperative nature of the distortions along x- and y - directions and non - cooperative nature in the z - direction .",
    "this involves the following canonical transformation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is given by @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the non - adiabatic regime ( @xmath47 ) and strong coupling limit ( large @xmath48 ) , the transformed hamiltonian can be written as @xmath49 , where the unperturbed hamiltonian is given by @xmath50 and the perturbation being @xmath51,\\label{perturbed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath53.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 is the polaronic energy and @xmath55 represents the nearest - neighbor repulsion for the hcbs .",
    "the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath56 , relevant for perturbation theory are @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the ground state with no phonons .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies of such states are given by @xmath59 .",
    "similar to the case of 1d cbm model @xcite , we also have @xmath60 , which yields the first order perturbation term @xmath61 . considering the case @xmath62",
    ", we perform second order perturbation theory similar to that in 1d cbm model @xcite and obtain the effective hamiltonian to be @xmath63 one can easily see that the first term in @xmath64 is @xmath65 whereas the simplification of the second term ( which we call @xmath66 ) requires quite a bit of algebra .",
    "we extend the derivation of the effective hamiltonian for the 1d cbm case @xcite to our two - dimensional case as well .",
    "the small parameter here is given by @xmath67^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] whose derivation is similar to that in ref . .",
    "for the second term @xmath66 in @xmath64 , we now obtain the following terms :      the nn repulsion term comes from a process where a particle jumps to a neighboring site and comes back . in 2d , this term further consists of two parts : @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] . using @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and following a procedure explained in appendix a , we get the expression for this process to be @xmath72 , \\label{nn_repulsion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 . based on eq.([g_napprox ] ) we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "we first make an important point while considering a process of a particle hopping to a neighboring site and coming back . in 2d , excluding the originating site , we must take into account the occupancy information about all the three remaining nn sites of the intermediate site of hopping the process . for example , consider a process where a hcb at site @xmath29 hops to its neighboring site @xmath75 and comes back . for this process",
    ", we need to keep in mind the occupancy of the sites @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which are the three relevant neighboring sites of the intermediate site @xmath75 . depending on whether these sites are occupied or empty",
    ", the coefficient of the process will be modified accordingly .",
    "essentially there are four cases : 1 ) all the three nn sites are empty ; 2 ) any one of the three neighboring sites is occupied ; 3 ) any two of the nn sites are occupied ; and 4 ) all the thee neighboring sites are occupied .",
    "considering all the cases above , we end up with the following terms in @xmath79 .",
    "the first term is the nnn repulsion along the diagonals of the square lattice and is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 being the magnetization of the system .",
    "we find the second term to be the nnn repulsion along x- and y - axes of the square lattice and is given by @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the next term in @xmath66 is the hopping of the hcbs to the nnn sites . just like the nnn repulsion ,",
    "the nnn hopping of the hcbs can also be divided into two types of processes : nnn hopping along the diagonals and nnnn hopping along the x- and y - axes .",
    "while calculating the coefficient of the nnn hopping , we have to keep in mind the fact that the hcb passes through an intermediate site while hopping to its nnn site .",
    "so the coefficient must depend on the occupancy of the two neighboring sites of the intermediate site .",
    "for example if a hcb at site @xmath29 is hopping to its right - upper diagonal site , i.e. , @xmath77 , it can follow any one of the two possible paths : a ) first going along x - axis to the @xmath75-th site and then along y - axis to the @xmath77-th site and b ) the interchanged process , i.e. , hopping along the y - axis first to the @xmath85-th site followed by a hop along the x - axis to the @xmath77-th site .",
    "for the first path , the coefficient of the hopping depends on whether the two sites @xmath76 and @xmath78 , which are nn of the intermediate site @xmath75 , are occupied or empty . on the other hand , for the second path , the hopping coefficient depends on the occupancy of the two neighboring sites of the intermediate site @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . to calculate the nnn hopping coefficient",
    ", first we forget about the intermediate site and calculate the coefficient without its effect .",
    "finally we modify the coefficient according to the occupancy of the neighboring sites of the intermediate site .",
    "so , without considering the occupancy of the neighbors of the intermediate site , the nnn hopping along diagonals is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 .",
    "for large @xmath91 values , using the approximate value @xmath92 , we see that @xmath89 reduces to @xmath93 .",
    "now , taking the neighbors of the intermediate site into account , the nnn hopping term along the diagonals of the square lattice modifies to @xmath94 where @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 .",
    "next we consider the hopping of the hcbs to the nnnn sites along the x- and y - axes of the square lattice .",
    "similar to the previous case , the coefficient of the hopping in this case , depends on the occupancy of the two neighboring sites of the intermediate site .",
    "for example , if a hcb is hopping from site @xmath29 to its nnnn site @xmath76 , it has to pass through the intermediate site @xmath75 .",
    "so , the coefficient for this process depends on whether the neighboring sites of site @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are occupied or empty .",
    "taking into account all the possibilities of the occupancy of these two sites , we get the nnnn hopping term along x- and y - axes to be @xmath97 with @xmath98 .    finally , taking all the terms present in @xmath66 into account , @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) reduces to @xmath99 where @xmath100 and all the other terms , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , being the same as defined earlier .",
    "to study the phase diagram of our effective hamiltonian of hcbs , we use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation employing the stochastic - series - expansion ( sse ) technique .",
    "the first step required for sse is to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of spin-1/2 operators . identifying the relations between the operators for hcbs and those for spin-1/2 particles as @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we recast our effective hamiltonian for hcbs as an extended xxz spin-1/2 hamiltonian , given by @xmath106\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum_{<<i , j>>}\\left[-\\frac{j_{2xy}}{2}\\left(s_i^+s_j^-+{\\rm h.c.}\\right)+j_{2z } s_i^z s_j^z\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum_{<<<i , j>>>}\\left[-\\frac{j_{3xy}}{2}\\left(s_i^+s_j^-+{\\rm h.c.}\\right)+j_{3z } s_i^z s_j^z\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & -h_0\\sum_i s_i^z.\\label{h_sse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",

    ", we can actually tune the magnetization of the system and study the behavior of the system at various fillings .",

    "we vary the magnetization from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , which means varying the particle density from half - filled to fully - filled . due to particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian",
    ", the physics at a filling - fraction @xmath153 is the same as that at @xmath154 .",
