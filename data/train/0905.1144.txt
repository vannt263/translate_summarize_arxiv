    "interactions between photons via electron - positron pair production can have a substantial effect on the observed spectra of extragalactic gamma - ray sources .",
    "this process , which can occur when the required threshold energy of twice the electron mass is present in the centre - of - mass frame , removes gamma rays en route to the observer @xcite , and provides a link between high - energy astrophysics and the extragalactic background light ( ebl )  the integrated luminosity of the universe at uv , optical , and ir frequencies .",
    "attempts to measure the present - day ebl through absolute photometry in the optical and ir portion of the spectrum are hampered by the bright foregrounds of the milky way and zodiacal light from dust in the solar system , as well as calibration uncertainties .",
    "measurements in the near- and far - ir are available from the dirbe and firas experiment on the _ cobe _ satellite (; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a tentative determination of the optical ebl was made in @xcite with revision in @xcite .",
    "number counts of observed galaxies provide a robust lower limit to the ebl , but the degree to which these measurements converge can be controversial .",
    "the analysis of the integrated galaxy counts in seven optical and near - ir bands by @xcite showed that flux from direct starlight converged to a fairly low level , below that claimed in the several dirbe detections of near - ir flux .",
    "recent experiments such as the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) satellite , _ iso _ , and _",
    "spitzer _ have provided counts data in a variety of non - optical wavelengths , placing lower limits on the local ebl at most wavelengths of interest .",
    "a more thorough discussion of current ebl constraints can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a number of techniques have been employed to build cosmological models of the emission of light from galaxies at uv to far - ir wavelengths .",
    "these include interpolation and extrapolation of cosmological observables such as star formation rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "another method evolves backward in time the local galaxy population , usually by assuming that the luminosity density changes with redshift as a power law at all wavelengths @xcite . a third class of techniques models the galaxy population forward in time , beginning with cosmological initial conditions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to build a suite of models of the evolving background light produced by stars and quasars , with a focus on the optical - uv background out to high redshift .",
    "a preliminary report on this work appeared in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the reprocessing of ionizing radiation by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) using the radiative transfer code cuba , and use the observed ionization state of the igm to constrain our models .",
    "the contribution of starlight to the ebl is predicted by recent semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation , described in @xcite .",
    "these have been used by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to make predictions for the evolving ebl .",
    "most previous modeling attempts , including our recent work with this new sam , have focused on observational data in the optical and ir .",
    "these are the wavelengths most relevant to observations of relatively nearby ( @xmath0 ) blazars with ground - based instruments , which until recently have typically featured energy thresholds above @xmath1 gev . with the recent launch of _ fermi _ with its large area telescope ( lat ) sensitivity range of 20 mev to 300 gev , as well as the advent of new ground - based experiments such as magic - ii with energy thresholds @xmath2 gev , it is now important to make theoretical predictions of the uv background at ionizing and non - ionizing wavelengths out to high redshift .",
    "this paper is an attempt to specifically target absorption in this region of the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "understanding the absorption that occurs for gamma rays observed between 1 and 100 gev is an uncertain undertaking due to the lack of sensitive observations of the ebl at the corresponding uv wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the declining opacities for gamma rays in this region means that sources are likely to be visible out to large redshift .",
    "evolution of the background must be taken into account when calculating absorption for all but the nearest blazars , and at high redshifts the ebl can have a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) much different than observed locally .",
    "the most distant object with confirmed redshift that has been detected at vhe energies is currently the flat - spectrum radio quasar 3c279 @xcite at @xmath3 .",
    "this object was observed at energies between 90 and 500 gev , with a steep spectrum that was likely due in part to ebl absorption . in the 10 to 100 gev energy decade that is now being probed by _",
    "fermi _ and upgraded ground experiments , the characteristic redshift at which the ebl becomes optically thick to pair - production is expected to increase to redshifts of several .",
    "a small number of calculations have been performed that specifically addressed the question of the gamma - ray absorption by the uv background . in , two different models of star - formation , based on different assumptions about the b - band normalization , were used to predict gamma - ray opacities from 10 to 200 gev , with propagation of ionizing photons through the igm taken into account .",
    "this work suggested that the universe becomes optically thick at a few tens of gev for gamma rays emitted at @xmath4 .",
    "a second work which focused on the uv background , @xcite , argued that the absorption by ionizing photons was negligible , and that @xmath5 gev observed gamma rays would only be significantly attenuated at higher redshifts , where they would interact with photons below the lyman limit .",
    "ly@xmath6 photons were found to be a significant component of the uv flux .",
    "this paper also explored the possibility of using _ fermi _ to detect an evolving blazar attenuation edge , which would probe high - redshift star - formation .",
    "finally , the background model of targeted absorption of 10500 gev gamma rays , and used an estimate of high - redshift star - formation based on evolution seen in damped ly@xmath6 systems . this work also included a uv contribution from quasars .    at energies below the lyman limit ,",
    "lower bounds on galaxy emissivity exist from number counts by _ galex _ @xcite and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , as well as balloon - based experiments @xcite .",
    "such experiments are subject to systematic errors in completeness and photometric measurement of apparent magnitude , and can only test the background out to moderate redshift . at higher redshifts",
    "we no longer have measurements that directly connect to the ebl , such as direct number counts and absolute photometry , and uncertainties and possible biases in cosmological measurements such as luminosity functions and star - formation rate density become increasingly problematic .",
    "measurements of the ionization state of the igm can provide constraints on ionizing flux . at redshifts higher than the ` breakthrough redshift ' @xmath7 ,",
    "the universe is optically thick to lyman continuum photons , and ionizing fields become local , with a mean free path that decreases rapidly at larger redshifts @xcite , while below this redshift the mean free path becomes longer than the horizon length .",
    "studies of the opacity of ly@xmath6 and other redshifted absorption lines place constraints on the emission of uv photons by probing the neutral fraction , and therefore the balance between photoionizations and recombinations @xcite . as these lines are affected by the local radiation , they provide information about sources existing at approximately the redshift of the absorber .",
    "two methods of determining the ionization state of the igm include the proximity effect , in which one searches for the decrease in ly@xmath6 emissions near an agn @xcite , and flux decrement analysis , which utilizes hydrodynamic simulations to model the distribution of ly@xmath6 absorption along the line of sight to an agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the line - of - sight proximity effect utilizes the decrease in absorption lines in the vicinity of a quasar , compared to farther away along the line of sight , due to increased ionization fraction . as the quasar has a known uv luminosity ,",
    "the deficit of absorption in this region can be used to estimate the background ; a larger change indicates a lower background flux .",
    "as quasars do not reside in typical cosmological environments , a number of potential biases exist .",
    "quasars tend to be found in overdense environments , which can lead to overestimates of the background flux by as much as a factor of 3 .",
    "time variation in luminosity on the time - scale of photoionization , typically @xmath8 years , will also tend to bias results towards a high background , as quasars tend to be selected in their brightest phases @xcite .",
    "it is also now recognized that using broad emission lines such as ly@xmath6 tends to lead to underestimated redshifts and therefore higher quasar luminosity @xcite .",
    "this may have been a problem in many determinations of the proximity effect .",
    "the assumed cosmological model also affects the resulting background inferred by these measurements .",
    "the second method mentioned , the less - direct flux decrement technique @xcite , is not without its own potential biases ; it relies on correct cosmological parameters and knowledge of the quasar s unabsorbed continuum level , a problem at high redshift where absorption is strong .",
    "newer attempts to correct for the biases in proximity effects measurements , such as @xcite , have found lower values for the ionizing background flux that are more consistent with the flux decrement technique .",
    "observations of the ly@xmath6 forest can also provide clues about the types of sources producing the ionizing background , which in our model include star - forming galaxies and quasars .",
    "the quasar luminosity function ( lf ) has been measured by large - scale surveys such as the two - degree field ( 2df ) @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , and data are also available at a variety of frequencies from experiments such as _ xmm _ , _ chandra _ , and _ spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is known to be fully ionized below a redshift of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "photons above the lyman limit are responsible for reionizing the universe and maintaining it in a highly ionized state .",
    "the relative contributions of star - forming galaxies and agn to this process are not fully understood , but there is evidence that quasars are a sub - dominant component at this epoch .",
    "the decline of the quasar luminosity function observed beyond redshift three constrains the quasar contribution to the ionizing background to be @xmath10 @xcite , unless there is an unexpected steep upturn in the quasar luminosity function at low luminosities .",
    "a new approach by utilizing semi - analytic modeling sets limits on the quasar contribution to ionizing radiation of 1.4 to 14.5 per cent at @xmath11 , and studies of the soft x - ray background also constrain this fraction to be subdominant @xcite .",
    "increased quasar emission is believed to be responsible for he ii reionization , which as tracked by he ii ly@xmath6 absorption takes place at a lower redshift than hydrogen , z @xmath9 3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the shape of the ionizing background therefore evolves in redshift , with a hardening of the spectrum that is indicative of an increased contribution from quasars .",
    "the degree to which agn dominate the uv background at the time of he reionization is a debated issue , with some suggestions that stars and agn provide roughly equal contributions to the background at z @xmath9 3 @xcite .",
    "one of the major sources of uncertainty in this transition lies in the unresolvable faint end of the agn luminosity function .",
    "the ratio between hydrogen and helium ionization fractions , particularly h i ( 13.6 ev ) and he ii ( 54.4 ev ) , can be used to measure the slope of the total uv spectrum in this regime .",
    "the decrease in the optical depth of he ii indicates that the harder radiation from quasars increases with time between z = 5 and 3 @xcite .    aside from quasars ,",
    "the known dominant sources of uv radiation are short - lived massive stars , mainly of o- and b - type , which closely trace the star formation rate density .",
    "estimating the ionizing contribution from star - forming galaxies directly is complicated by the fact that only a small fraction @xmath12 of this radiation escapes from galaxies due to neutral gas and dust in the interstellar medium , as we will discuss in section 2.4 .    because of the uncertain nature and evolution of sources of ionizing radiation , in this paper we consider four models that attempt to span a realistic range of assumptions . in section 2",
    "we discuss the inputs to our model , including a short description of our semi - analytic models , assumed quasar luminosity density , and radiative transfer code . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce our four uv background models and present results , including the evolving background radiation and comparisons with ly@xmath6 forest measurements .",
    "the main results of the paper , gamma - ray opacities , are presented in section 4 , with a discussion following in section 5 .",
    "our four models are summarized in table [ tab : models ] , and their successes and failures in accounting for the data are summarized in table [ tab : modelsum ] .",
    "to calculate the evolving uv background we have used predictions of the uv luminosity density from galaxies , as provided by recent semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation , combined with estimates of quasar emissivity .",
    "the combined emissivities from galaxies and quasars are integrated over redshift to find the evolving background flux .",
    "photons from these sources at energies above the lyman limit can be absorbed and reradiated by the igm ; we calculate the effect of these processes using the cuba radiative transfer code . in this section",
    "we discuss the semi - analytic models and radiative transfer code used in calculating the background , and show some general results .",
    "the semi - analytic models used in calculating the ebl in this work are described in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s08 ) , and are based on the models described in and @xcite , with several new updates and capabilities ; we provide a very brief summary in the following paragraphs .",
    "interested readers should also see @xcite and @xcite , which focused on the optical and ir ebl resulting from galaxies in this model .",
    "the backbone of the semi - analytic models are dark matter `` merger trees '' , which describe the cosmological assembly history of dark matter haloes as they build up over time through mergers and accretion of diffuse material .",
    "these merger trees may either be constructed via monte carlo techniques based on the extended press - schechter theory ( as in this work ) , or extracted from n - body simulations .",
    "we compute the rate at which gas can cool via atomic processes and be accreted onto the central galaxy within the potential well of each of these collapsed and virialized dm haloes .",
    "cold gas is then converted into stars in both a `` quiescent '' and starburst modes .",
    "the `` quiescent '' mode takes place in isolated discs and is modeled according to an empirical prescription based on the schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite . the starburst mode is triggered during mergers , with gas being rapidly converted into stars on time - scales determined from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers .",
    "feedback from supernovae and massive stars can reheat cold gas and expel it from the galaxy .",
    "chemical evolution is modeled using a simple instantaneous recycling approximation with the effective yield treated as a free parameter .",
    "the most recent models also treat the growth of supermassive black holes within galactic nuclei and the impact of the released energy on galaxies and their environment .",
    "seed black holes , perhaps originating from the remants of very massive pop iii stars , are planted in the top - level haloes in the merger trees , and can grow by two accretion mechanisms .",
    "galaxy mergers trigger rapid ( eddington limited ) `` bright mode '' accretion and correspond observationally to classical x - ray or optically luminous quasars and agn .",
    "bright mode agn activity drives winds that can expel cold gas from the galaxy .",
    "accretion of hot gas from the hot halo feeds low - level ( bondi ) `` radio mode '' accretion , which is associated with the production of giant radio jets .",
    "these jets are assumed to be capable of heating the surrounding hot gas halo , offsetting or even quenching cooling flows .",
    "although the radio mode feedback in particular has been shown to play a key role in reproducing important galaxy properties in these models , such as galaxy colour bimodality and luminosity functions , the predictions for observable properties of quasars and agn in these models has not yet been thoroughly tested . therefore , in this work , we instead add in the contribution to the background radiation due to quasars empirically .",
    "the star formation and chemical enrichment histories for each galaxy are convolved with stellar population models to produce synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "we make use of the models with a chabrier stellar initial mass function .",
    "our models include a simple estimate of the attenuation of starlight due to dust , based on a two - component model similar to that proposed by .",
    "one component is the diffuse `` cirrus '' dust in the disc and another is associated with the dense ` birth clouds ' surrounding young star forming regions .",
    "the @xmath13-band , face - on extinction optical depth of the diffuse dust is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a free parameter , @xmath16 is the metallicity of the cold gas , @xmath17 is the mass of the cold gas in the disc , and @xmath18 is the radius of the cold gas disc . to compute the actual extinction",
    "we assign each galaxy a random inclination and use a standard ` slab ' model .",
    "additionally , stars younger than @xmath19 yr are enshrouded in a cloud of dust with optical depth @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "finally , to extend the extinction correction to other wavebands , we assume a galactic attenuation curve @xcite for the diffuse dust component and a power - law extinction curve @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , for the birth clouds .",
    "the free parameters are adjusted to reproduce the observed ratios of far - uv to far - ir luminosity in nearby galaxies .",
    "we consider two different choices of parameters for our semi - analytic models , which differ primarily in the assumed cosmological parameters .",
    "the free parameters that control galaxy formation in each model are then tuned to match local galaxy observations , as described in s08 ( the actual values of the parameters for both models are also given in s08 , table 2 ) .",
    "the ` fiducial ' model adopts a concordance cosmology with @xmath24 = 0.3 , @xmath25 = 0.7 , @xmath26 = 0.70 , and @xmath27 = 0.90 .",
    "our ` low ' model adopts the best fit values from wmap3 for these parameters , with @xmath24 = 0.2383 , @xmath25 = 0.7617 , @xmath26 = 0.732 , and @xmath27 = 0.761 .",
    "the most relevant difference in this work is the value of the power spectrum normalization @xmath27 .",
    "the lower normalization of the primordial power spectrum in the ` low ' model leads to delayed structure formation and decreased luminosity densities at high redshifts ( see s08 ) . adopting the best - fitting parameters from the more recent analysis of wmap5 , which favored @xmath28 @xcite , gives nearly identical results to our wmap3 ( low ) models .",
    "the predictions for attenuated and unattenuated emissivity from our fiducial semi - analytic model are shown for several redshifts in fig .",
    "[ fig : starsed ] .",
    "predictions from the ` low ' model are qualitatively similar , although because of the delayed star formation , galaxies tend to have higher gas surface densities , and therefore higher dust opacities and larger attenuation values are predicted .    in our companion ebl paper ( @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite ) , we compare the predictions of our sams with a broad range of data , including local luminosity functions , optical and ir luminosity density , and number counts in a variety of bands from the uv to far - ir . in a planned future paper we will make a careful comparison of these models with the galaxy population at high redshift . here",
    "we show just a few representative results demonstrating that our models are doing reasonably well at reproducing the uv properties of local and distant galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : countsuv ] we compare our model predictions with galaxy number counts in two uv bands , using data from the _ galex _ satellite and other experiments .",
    "this provides a test of the low - redshift normalization of our model in the uv range .",
    "_ galex _ has surveyed the sky these bands and provided data down to magnitude @xmath29 @xcite . at fainter magnitudes",
    ", there are measurements from the stis instrument on the _ hst _",
    "@xcite , albeit with large uncertainty due to poor statistics .",
    "populations of brighter objects have also been probed by the foca balloon - borne uv telescope , and counts from this instrument at 2000   have typically yielded higher numbers than _ galex _ after wavelength correction , possibly due to differences in calibration .",
    "our models show good agreement with the data at 2310  , but are a bit higher than the _ galex _ observations at 1530  , though they are not in disagreement with the foca data .",
    "recent data from a variety of instruments has constrained the uv luminosity density out to high redshift . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldevo1500 ] we have compared the uv emissivity in galaxies from our models against data at a rest frame emission wavelength of approximately 1500  .",
    "we find that data from the _",
    "galex_-vvds , goods , and deep _ hst _ acs imaging all agree reasonably well with the uv evolution of our fiducial model .",
    "the star - formation rate density ( sfrd ) as a function of redshift in the ` fiducial ' and ` low ' models are shown in fig .   [ fig : sfr ] , compared with observational estimates of star formation density at various redshifts , all of which has been converted to a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) . at @xmath30 , both of our models are in good agreement with the observational compilation of @xcite , while at @xmath31 they tend to skirt the lower envelope of observational values . however , there are still large discrepancies between sfr estimates from different indicators and different data sets at these redshifts , in part due to the increased fraction of star formation in heavily obscured systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the correction for dust obscuration is uncertain . at @xmath32 , the sfrd in the ` low ' model",
    "declines fairly steeply , while in the fiducial model the sfrd remains nearly constant from @xmath33 and then declines more gradually . as discussed above and in s08",
    ", this is because of the lower normalization of the power spectrum and reduced small scale power in this model , which delays the formation of structure .    above redshift four ,",
    "observational estimates of global star - formation rates diverge , and different measurements can disagree by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "studies of uv luminosity functions of dropout galaxies by bouwens and collaborators @xcite find relatively low values for the global sfr , with a monotonic decrease above redshift four .",
    "higher rates have been found by other authors , including those who have derived star - formation history from detections of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest a much higher rate of star formation which does not decrease significantly until @xmath34",
    ". this may be due in part to the fact that the bouwens et al .",
    "data points that we report here were obtained by integrating the uv luminosity function down to a luminosity corresponding to 0.04 times the observed value of @xmath35 at redshift three .",
    "other authors make different choices for the lower limit of integration , and the relatively steep slope of the uv lf at these redshifts implies that this can make a significant difference .",
    "the sam predictions shown include the star formation in all galaxies ( down to the mass resolution of the simulation ) .",
    "our ` low ' semi - analytic model , based on the lower determination of @xmath27 in wmap3 , produces a star - formation rate that is lower than most of the data points at mid and high redshift , and reproduces the rapid fall - off in star formation indicated by the bouwens points . our ` fiducial ' model , based on wmap1 , does a better job of matching the higher star - formation rates seen in other dropout analyses , as well as the data from gamma - ray bursts .",
    "although not shown here , another way to constrain the star formation history of the universe is via the build - up of stellar mass in the form of long - lived stars .",
    "as shown in s08 , the fiducial model predicts a stellar mass density that is higher than observational estimates by a factor of two at @xmath36 and a factor of three at @xmath37 , while the ` low ' ( wmap3 ) model produces good agreement with the stellar mass assembly history .",
    "as discussed in s08 , this discrepancy between the observed stellar mass assembly history and the star formation history has been pointed out in a number of recent papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one possible explanation is that the stellar imf was more top - heavy in the past ( so that more uv photons were produced per total unit mass of star formation ) . however , it is also still possible that the discrepancy is simply due to observational uncertainties in the estimates of star formation rates and/or stellar masses .",
    "in addition to the star - formation histories predicted self - consistently in our fiducial and low semi - analytic models , we consider an additional ad hoc ` high - peaked fiducial ' form for the sf history above @xmath38 .",
    "this is not a semi - analytic model ; it is simply a functional form that was chosen to be consistent with the highest observational determinations of the star - formation rate .",
    "we then utilize the same redshift - dependent dust extinction factors as the fiducial model .",
    "we include this case to illustrate the predictions for gamma - ray attenuation for an extreme model with the maximum plausible uv background at high redshift .",
    "however , we note that as the fiducial model already produces an integrated stellar mass density in excess of that observed at high redshift , the high - peaked model is strongly disfavoured by these observations .      ionizing photons from galaxies and quasars which escape into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are processed by neutral hydrogen and neutral and singly - ionized helium which resides in ly@xmath6 forest clouds ( lac ) and thicker lyman - limit systems ( lls ) , defined here as having column densities @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "this has a strong effect on the spectrum and intensity of the average background field .",
    "the propagation of ionizing flux through the igm in our models is calculated using an updated version of the cuba code .",
    "an earlier version of cuba is described in and is based on the theory of . here",
    "we briefly summarize some of the main ideas and formalism from these papers .",
    "the effect of residual neutral gas on the ionizing radiation field can be described in general terms by the radiative transfer equation :    @xmath41    here @xmath42 is the intensity of the radiation field for frequency @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the emissivity , @xmath45 is the cosmological scale factor , @xmath46 is the speed of light , and @xmath47 is the continuum absorption coefficient .",
    "this equation accounts for both the redshifting of photons to lower energies , and absorption by neutral gas .",
    "quasars and star - forming galaxies contribute to @xmath44 in our model , along with the diffuse reemission of absorption systems .",
    "lyman absorbers are taken to have a distribution that can be described in terms of power laws in column density and redshift @xmath48 with parameters @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51    used in these models .",
    "a distribution with slope -1.5 in column density has been shown to describe absorbers over a wide range in @xmath52 @xcite , and the slopes for redshift evolution are based on observational determinations @xcite . the effective optical depth from the ly@xmath6 forest absorption in this distribution",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauhi ] .",
    "note that our ly@xmath6 optical depth does not follow the upturn seen at @xmath53 , where a rapid rise in absorption may signal that our assumption of a uniform uv background is no longer valid .",
    "it should be noted that the exact form of the column distribution function is not critical , as it is the integrated value of this parameter from which we derive the effective optical depth and therefore the average background .",
    "the effective depth is dominated by clouds with opacity near unity .",
    "using a power - law form simplifies the integration process , and speeds up our computation with little loss in accuracy .",
    "we do caution readers that the choice of distribution function can have a large effect on he ii absorption , and in turn on the background above 54.4 ev which we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : eblhistuv ] .",
    "the background at these energies is not expected to affect our gamma - ray attenuation significantly because the photon density at these high energies is so low .",
    "lyman systems reradiate a fraction of the absorbed light via recombination radiation .",
    "our code accounts for the contribution of h i recombinations to the uv flux via free - bound , ly@xmath6 , and two - photon continuum emission . for the latter two ,",
    "only the non - ionizing background is affected .",
    "the total proper volume emissivity from igm clouds from radiation released for a particular mode can be quantified as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the fraction of recombinations leading to the particular mode , which has probability @xmath56 of creating a photon of energy @xmath43 . in the case of lyman-@xmath6 emission",
    "this is simply a delta function at the line energy , and for the continuum distributions descriptions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the remaining functions contain the details of emission and absorption from absorption systems    @xmath57    @xmath58    the first of these quantities is the rate of ionizations by the background field @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 encodes the information about the optical depth for photons of a given energy , and thus the probability of being absorbed .",
    "equation [ eq : xi ] is the integral over absorption systems , multiplied by @xmath61 , which is the probability of a photon of given energy escaping from a cloud after emission .",
    "the code does not include the contribution from sawtooth modulation due to h i and he ii lyman resonances .",
    "we do not include radiation from recombinations to he i , as neutral helium is small in number density compared to both h i and he ii ( though that may not be the case at redshifts on the verge of reionization ) .",
    "as shown in , thermal collisional effects can provide a sizable fraction ( 20 to 30 per cent ) of the h i emission by ly@xmath6 and two - photon processes ; these are not accounted for in our code .",
    "collisions between he ii atoms are never significant , as there is insufficient thermal energy to excite these modes .",
    "the fraction of ionizing photons produced that escape from galaxies into the igm is a free parameter in our model .",
    "this parameter is poorly constrained , with observations and simulations giving widely different and sometimes conflicting results . in the literature",
    ", the escape fraction may be defined in a couple ways .",
    "the absolute escape fraction is simply the fraction of radiation at wavelengths just shortward of 912    which escapes the dust and neutral hydrogen in a galaxy .",
    "this definition is most relevant for the purposes of modeling the ionizing background .",
    "what is actually measured in observations is the relative escape fraction , where the ionizing flux is compared to a non - ionizing wavelength , often 1500  .",
    "as described below , we use a relative definition which separates the amounts of attenuation due to dust and h i ( equation [ eq : fesc ] ) . ionizing radiation from quasars is not attenuated in escaping the host galaxy in our model .    direct detection of escaping uv radiation",
    "has only been successful in a handful of individual cases .",
    "as two of these detections have been for galaxies at z@xmath93 with large escape fractions measured @xcite , the fact that many low redshift attempts to find ionizing radiation have failed with low upper bounds may suggest evolution in this quantity between redshifts one and three .",
    "rather firm upper limits on escape fraction from direct detection efforts exist for lower redshift galaxies ( see the compilation in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported ionizing flux from 29 stacked galaxies at @xmath62 , at a level indicating little or no attenuation .",
    "however , this result suffered from a selection bias , as the lyman ",
    "break galaxies used were chosen from the bluest quartile of the population .",
    "while observations have mainly determined upper limits on the ionizing escape fractions , some authors have used the ionization state of the igm to derive lower limits .",
    "ionization rates inferred from ly@xmath6 forest data and reasonable extrapolations of source number to faint luminosity can require a high escape fraction .",
    "values of @xmath63 per cent above redshift 5 were found to be needed in . have found that constraints on the escape fraction from @xmath64 z @xmath65 from n - body simulations require a global minimum of 5 per cent to match ly@xmath6 data , with a higher fraction needed in the event that star formation in galaxies in smaller haloes is suppressed .",
    "recently , detailed adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) n - body hydrodynamical simulations of high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath66 z @xmath67 ) by @xcite have found low escape fractions of 13 per cent , without strong evolution in redshift or dependence on galaxy properties .",
    "this work found that most escaping ionizing radiation originated from stars in a thin shell at the outside of the h i disc .",
    "smaller galaxies have less escaping radiation due to the fact that their h i discs are thicker relative to the distribution of young stars .",
    "dust is found to have little effect on the escape of lyman - continuum radiation , as the unobscured minority of stars that provide most of the escaping ionizing radiation have essentially no attenuation due to dust , while stars that have translucent ( @xmath68 ) optical depths due to dust are generally completely obscured by hi .",
    "another analysis has been undertaken using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code by and has found evolving escape fractions , with @xmath69 to 10 per cent at @xmath70 decreasing to 1 to 2 per cent at @xmath71 .",
    "this simulation did not include the effects of dust .",
    "our semi - analytic models predict the emissivity from star - forming galaxies down to a minimum rest - frame wavelength of 100  .",
    "lyman - continuum photons are attenuated by a factor @xmath72 ; this determines the absorption of photons shortward of 912   and is a non - evolving input to our radiative transfer code .",
    "this parameter is defined as the following ratio of intrinsic and observable luminosities at 912 and 1500 @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the absolute attenuation factor from both dust and h i for ionizing photons near the lyman limit , and @xmath75 is the factor from dust alone at 1500  . as dust absorption is an evolving effect included in the semi - analytic model , total absorption @xmath74 for ionizing photons escaping from galaxies must be interpreted as the product of  and the average @xmath75 for a particular redshift in the model .",
    "the average value of @xmath75 in our model is higher at high redshift , and is higher in the low model than in the fiducial model at high redshift .",
    "typical values of @xmath76 , as seen in the difference between attenuated and unattenuated curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : starsed ] , vary from about 6.8 at @xmath37 to 11.2 at @xmath77 for our fiducial model , and 9.7 to 14.2 in the low model . as noted in @xcite , taking the total absorption to be a product of the dust and h i factors may not be physically realistic , as the two components are may not be distributed in the same way within the galaxy , however it is sufficient for the purpose of calculating emissivities , as we are dealing only with global quantities .",
    "quasar input to our model is accomplished using an assumed uv luminosity density , which determines the output at all energies via a fixed spectral form .",
    "we have used the quasar luminosity functions at 912    determined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hrh07 ) which are based on a large observational data set and spectral and obscurational modeling .",
    "this work found that , with the appropriate corrections for obscuration , a single bolometric function could match data in each band .",
    "both the bright- and faint - end slopes of the lf are argued to become more shallow at higher redshift , indicating a increasing contribution from bright , unobscured agn , which dominate the total agn luminosity above redshift @xmath78 .",
    "another approach to modeling the quasar contribution to the background was presented in .",
    "this work estimated the evolution of the unobserved faint - end of the quasar luminosity function at high redshift using observational constraints on the ionizing background .",
    "they found very different results depending on whether they used constraints on the ionizing background from the quasar proximity effect or from the lyman-@xmath6 flux decrement method . assuming the broken power law universal quasar spectrum we present below",
    ", the hrh07 luminosity density evolution at 912   is similar to model ` a ' of sb03 , which produced the lowest fluxes and was found to be consistent with the flux decrement data when combined with a substantial contribution from star - forming galaxies .",
    "the highest derived flux , arising in model ` c ' , was sufficient to produce ionizing photons at the level suggested by proximity effect measurements . while we recognize that it is probable that many of these proximity effect measurements overestimate the background due to aforementioned biases , we will use the sb03 model ` c ' for the purposes of creating and analyzing an extremely quasar - dominated background model .",

    "our fiducial model with the hrh07 qso lf ( first entry in table [ tab : models ] ) provides a reasonable match to the level of ionizing flux inferred from ly@xmath6 forest measurements when an h i escape fraction of 0.1 is assumed ; this corresponds to a total @xmath74 of 1 to 1.5 per cent when combined with the dust absorption values predicted by our semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "the ` low ' model for the sfr density , with the lower cdm power spectrum normalization of wmap3 , requires a larger escape fraction to match ionization rate data , especially the higher redshift points @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is required . both of these models fail reproduce the nearly constant ionization rate between @xmath101 seen in some flux decrement analyses .",
    "the high - peaked model , which has a star - formation rate that increases until redshift 5 , does produce a somewhat flatter ionization rate , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the large amount of high - redshift star - formation in this model is not supported by estimates of stellar mass buildup , and should be considered a somewhat extreme scenario .",
    "another mechanism for producing a flatter ionization rate history is an evolving escape fraction that increases with redshift , a possibility that we do not explore here but which has been seen in some simulations , and as already mentioned may be suggested by observations which have detected lyman continuum radiation from distant ( @xmath102 ) galaxies @xcite , but not closer sources @xcite .",
    "this would have only a weak effect on the opacities we have calculated , as most attenuation of gamma rays is due to the non - ionizing uv background , which would have a much larger number density than the ionizing background even for a high escape fraction .",
    "our results suggest that observations of sufficient numbers of high - energy gamma - ray sources out to high redshift could provide a probe of the uv background at these epochs that is independent of any other observational test .",
    "pair - production with target background photons produces a spectral cutoff at energies that are dependent upon redshift and assumed cosmological model . with enough detections of blazars and/or gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) at different confirmed redshifts in the 10 to 100 gev energy decade , it should be possible to detect an evolving cutoff in energy , and distinguish between the different background levels proposed in this work .",
    "the exact number of blazars that will be detected at gev energies over the coming years is uncertain and dependent upon the poorly - understood emission processes and number density evolution of these sources .",
    "however , even conservative estimates indicate that a large number of sources will be detectable by the _ fermi _  spacecraft , which was launched in june 2008 and is currently in all - sky survey mode .",
    "the egret experiment on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "( _ cgro _ ) detected more than 60 high - confidence blazars at energies of @xmath103 mev out to redshift 2.28 , mostly of the flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) type @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation of these results suggests that _ fermi _ will see @xmath104 blazars extending to higher redshift @xcite .",
    "an analysis of two different realizations of the blazar luminosity function by @xcite suggested that _ fermi _ could detect thousands of blazars , and would potentially be able to measure attenuation at distances as great as @xmath77 .",
    "the 3-month _ fermi _ lat survey has already reported 106 agn sources at high confidence @xcite .",
    "in addition to analyzing blazar spectra in survey and pointed observations , _ fermi _ will also act as a finder for new and upcoming ground - based experiments such as h.e.s.s .- ii and magic - ii which will be capable of resolving most of the energy ranges of interest . in survey mode ,",
    "_ fermi _ will also act as an alert system for flaring sources .",
    "none of our models predicts significant attenuation at 10 gev or below for any redshift . this is true even for our extremely quasar - dominated model , where the opacity of a 10 gev observed gamma ray is never higher than @xmath105 .",
    "as the ionizing flux in this model is higher than allowed by most measurements of the ly@xmath6 forest , it is unlikely that any cosmological model could produce significant gamma - ray opacity due to a large contribution of ionizing photons to the background .",
    "the high - peaked star formation model produces the most absorption in the 10100 gev energy range for @xmath106 , but despite having a very high uv output only has a moderate impact on the calculated optical depths relative to the fiducial model .",
    "it is useful to compare the absorption predicted by our models with the calculations of other authors who have used different methods , in the cases where their results include our energy and redshift regime of interest . in many instances ,",
    "our predicted attenuation is less than what has been previously proposed .    the background model of @xcite",
    "is based upon extrapolated luminosity functions determined from a large compilation of multiwavelength data , including deep acs imaging of distant galaxies , and treats separately the evolutionary histories of spiral , elliptical , and star - bursting galaxy populations .",
    "while their ebl agrees well with our fiducial model at z=0 and z=1 @xcite , their absorption @xmath107 in the 10100 gev energy decade is at least a factor of two greater at @xmath10824 than any of our models .",
    "the most recent models of stecker and collaborators @xcite are based on a ` backwards evolution ' model in which galaxies emission seds are determined by their brightness in one band , taken to be 60 @xmath109 .",
    "the luminosity of the galaxy population at this wavelength is assumed to brighten with redshift as a power law in ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "one disadvantage of this method is that it attempts to describe luminosity evolution over several orders of magnitude in wavelength from a single broken power law , which can not take into account the complexity of galaxy evolution .",
    "gamma - ray opacities in this work are much higher than our predictions , with the universe optically thick ( @xmath111 ) to 10 gev gamma rays above @xmath112 , and for @xmath113 gev above @xmath36 .",
    "this level of absorption holds very different implications for experiments such as _ fermi_. at high redshifts , absorption cutoff spectral features would be visible between about 5 and 20 gev , with no signal from higher energies due to optical thickness from the background .",
    "the galaxy seds in these models have no emission above lyman energies , and therefore all attenuation at these very low energies is the result of near - threshold interactions with non - ionizing uv photons .",
    "the redshift - dependent optical and uv seds used are based on the population synthesis models of .",
    "this model does not include uv dust extinction , which as we have found in this work can reduce far - uv emissivity by a factor of @xmath910 at higher redshifts .",
    "the recent observation by _ fermi _ of high - energy emission from grb 080916c at z=4.35 @xcite provides a valuable first test of these predictions for gev absorption .",
    "the highest energy photon seen by the lat was 13.2 gev , with over 10 photons seen above 1 gev @xcite . in all of our models ,",
    "the gamma - ray optical depth is much less than 1 for this energy and redshift , and similar values are found in the star - formation models of @xcite .",
    "the models of stecker and collaborators predict a much higher opacity , @xmath114 to 4.5 , for the 13 gev photon . including the 1@xmath115 error on redshift and photon energy in finding maximal and minimal values",
    ", the corresponding transmission probability could be as high as 8.2 per cent for their ` baseline ' model , or as low as 0.5 per cent for the ` fast evolution ' model ( stecker , private communication ) .",
    "while it is difficult to draw conclusions from a single event , more bursts seen with gev emission equal or greater to grb 080916c could strongly disfavor such a large background flux , and observations of slightly higher energy photons ( @xmath116 gev ) from similar redshifts could provide a test of our models .",
    "we expect our approach to be reasonably accurate at predicting the ionizing and non - ionizing background fields out to redshift @xmath117 , where h i gunn - peterson troughs appear in observed quasar spectra @xcite . at higher redshifts , during the epoch of reionization , the concept of a uniform background for ionizing photons is no longer valid , as photons above the lyman limit are confined to the vicinity of their sources . in our lyman absorption model ( equation [ eq : lyforest ] ) , the sudden increase seen in h i opacity at redshift six is not represented , and our model would therefore be expected to overproduce the ionizing background above this redshift . a similar limitation exists in our treatment of he opacities above the redshift of he reionization @xmath118",
    "however , these factors alone are unlikely to have a significant effect on calculated opacities .",
    "we have made the assumption of a universal stellar imf in this work , and have not included a separate population of metal - free ( population - iii ) stars or other early source types such as miniquasars @xcite .",
    "these types of unobserved sources could have very different spectra than standard stellar populations , and could produce large contributions to the ionizing and non - ionizing uv backgrounds . because of redshift effects , gamma rays with low ( @xmath119 gev ) observed energies for very high - redshift sources could have significant interactions with the freely - propagating non - ionizing background .",
    "it is therefore possible that opacities at reionization redshifts could be much higher than we propose here due to unseen uv production mechanisms .",
    "while models for gamma - ray blazars do not typically predict sources at these high redshifts , grbs are known to exist above redshift six @xcite , and long - duration grbs could potentially be seen as far out as star - formation occurs .",
    "the egret experiment , operating from 30 mev up to @xmath930 gev , was able to view a small number of photons from grbs , and the detection of high - energy emission from grb 080916c by the _ fermi _ lat demonstrates the ability of this instrument to detect gev photons from these events .",
    "though predictions are highly uncertain , it is possible that grbs could produce significant numbers of photons well above 10 gev through inverse - compton or hadronic processes .",
    "calculations of the background flux from some possible reionization scenarios and source types at @xmath120 may therefore be a worthwhile undertaking .",
    "it has been suggested by a number of authors that the discrepancy between observed stellar mass density and instantaneous star - formation rate density ( see section  [ sec : sfr ] ) could be explained by an imf that evolves with redshift or is more top - heavy in rapidly star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an imf with shallower high - end slope has been suggested as a source of early reionization @xcite . altering the high - mass end of the imf will change the spectrum produced by galaxies and also the attenuation by dust , although as probes of star - formation generally involve the same high - mass stars that produce the uv background , there is some degree of degeneracy between these two quantities when the assumed imf is changed .",
