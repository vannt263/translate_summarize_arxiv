    "@xcite supercurrents in ti jj devices have recently been observed .",
    "@xcite unusual behavior , including a smaller than expected critical current normal resistance product , as well as an anomalous fraunhofer diffraction pattern , has been interpreted as evidence for 1d majorana fermions along the channel between the superconductors .",
    "@xcite however , the connection between these observations and majorana fermions is indirect .",
    "a difficulty with critical current measurements is that the predicted majorana behavior is only manifest when the phase difference @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 . in order to isolate the properties of the gapless majorana mode ,",
    "it is necessary to control the phase .",
    "moreover , the supercurrent carried by the junction includes contributions from gapped states .",
    "the gapless mode leads to only a weak singularity in the current phase relation at @xmath2 .",
    "another possible experiment would be to use a ring geometry and to tunnel into the junction region from another contact .",
    "similar experiments on 1d sns junctions revealed the expected collapse of the minigap in the normal region for @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite such experiments on a ti jj device could demonstrate the closing of the gap , but they would not distinguish an even and odd number of gapless channels .",
    "the unique feature of the 1d majorana mode is that as the phase is tuned through @xmath1 , the system _ must _ pass through a state where the majorana mode is transmitted perfectly along the channel - even in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "this leads to a quantized thermal conductance that in principle probes the central charge @xmath4 associated with the majorana mode , but would be difficult to measure .     through the ring .",
    "measurement of the current and low - frequency noise provides a signature sensitive to majorana fermion modes on the junction .",
    ", width=288 ]    in this paper we show that measurement of current and low - frequency current noise injected from the normal surface states at the _ ends _ of a ti jj give rise to a unique signature that is sensitive to the perfectly transmitted gapless majorana mode at @xmath3 .",
    "our setup , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , consists of a superconducting ring on the surface of a topological insulator with a linear channel .",
    "the phase difference across the junction is controlled by the magnetic flux through the ring , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite in addition , we introduce electrical contacts to the normal ti surfaces inside and outside the ring , as well as to the superconductor .",
    "this three - terminal geometry allows the average currents @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and the correlations @xmath9 to be measured as a function of the voltages @xmath10 relative to the grounded superconductor .",
    "we find that for a long junction at low temperature the linear conductance exhibits sharp steps when @xmath0 passes through odd multiples of @xmath1 .",
    "this singular behavior is a direct consequence of the gapless majorana mode at @xmath3 .",
    "when the electrical contacts consist of only a single transmitting channel , the magnitude of these steps is @xmath11 . in the more realistic situation where there are multiple channels in the leads",
    "the singular behavior is still present , though the size of the step is reduced .",
    "in addition , we find signatures for the majorana mode in the diagonal and cross correlations of the current noise .",
    "the cross correlation @xmath12 exhibits a narrow peak when @xmath13 due to the majorana mode . in the single channel limit",
    ", the height of the peak in the zero temperature limit is universal . for many channels ,",
    "the peak height is suppressed . the magnitude and sign of the peak , however , is predicted to be related to the size of the steps measured in the average current .",
    "finally , we predict the diagonal noise correlation @xmath14 also exhibits a sharp peak at @xmath3 . unlike the singular behavior of the average conductance and the cross correlation , however , the size of the peak is _ not _ suppressed when there are many channels , and provides a more robust signature of the majorana mode .",
    "our results are related to earlier work concerning resonant transmission through 0d majorana bound states .",
    "@xcite in particular , law , lee and ng  @xcite showed that tunneling into a majorana bound state at @xmath15 leads to a zero - bias resonant conductance @xmath11 associated with perfect andreev reflection of a single channel . in our geometry there are no discrete majorana zero modes . however , when the magnetic flux , rounded to the nearest integer multiple of @xmath16 is odd , there is effectively a majorana zero mode inside the ring , but it is strongly coupled to the continuum of states in the surface region coupled to the lead . in this regard ,",
    "the linear jj exhibits a behavior similar to the topological transition in a 1d topological superconductor  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the transition between the topological and non - topological phase , which occurs at @xmath3 is controlled by the magnetic flux .",
    "noise correlations associated with tunneling into majorana bound states have also been studied , and the noise correlations for @xmath3 resembles the noise correlations that have been studied for coupling to _ chiral _ majorana fermion modes associated with magnet - superconductor interfaces on the surface of a ti .",
    "an important difference between the present work and these earlier works , however , is that in our geometry , the superconducting phase @xmath0 , controlled by the magnetic flux through the ring , provides an accessible knob for controlling the coupling between the counterpropagating chiral majorana modes .",
    "this makes it possible to tune through the quantum critical point at @xmath3 that separates topological and non - topological phases .",
    "an advantage of the present approach is that the singular behavior of the current and noise near @xmath2 provides a distinctive signature for the majorana physics .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows .",
    "we first present in section  [ sec : modelsystem ] the specifics of our model for the josephson junction , focusing on a simple tunneling problem for the majorana channel and properly treating the interchannel reflection of the remaining modes in the leads .",
    "section  [ sec : experimentalsignatures ] focuses on experimental signatures of the gapless majorana channel : first we discuss the ideal case of single - channel leads and then we expand out to the more realistic multi - channel case , extracting the terms in the multi - channel current and noise which show singular behavior as @xmath0 winds through @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of experimental parameters and feasibility",
    ". additional appendixes  [ appendix : averagecurrent ] through  [ appendix : diagonalnoise ] provide complete derivations of the multi - channel observables and their single- and many - channel limits .",
    "while this manuscript was in the final stages of preparation we received a preprint by diez , et al .",
    "that presents an analysis of a related josephson junction geometry for topological superconductors .",
    "in ref .   it was shown that a josephson junction on the surface of a topological insulator exhibits a gapless majorana mode when the phase difference is equal to @xmath1 . at that point",
    ", there is a single , one - dimensional majorana mode that is transmitted perfectly along the length of the junction . for @xmath0 different from @xmath1 ,",
    "a gap opens in that mode . in the following we consider the low energy limit for phase difference close to @xmath1 , so that the transmission across the junction is dominated by the single gapless majorana mode , which can be described by a simple one - dimensional model . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , this mode couples to a single majorana mode in the contacts inside and outside the ring . in general , the contacts will involve many additional channels , so it is necessary to introduce a general scattering matrix that relates the incident channels and the transmitted channel .",
