    "perhaps one of the most useful tools for describing the nature of observed galactic populations is the luminosity function .",
    "the relative numbers of galaxies of different luminosities offer a quantitative description of the result of the structure formation scenario of the universe , nowadays available for inspection even as a function of redshift . the luminosity function , or mass function of galaxies",
    ", once a modeling of star formation histories and dust is included to yield mass to light ratios , is indeed one of the principal constraints against which cosmological simulations and structure formation theories in general are tested . often star formation efficiencies and histories are calibrated through a fitting of predicted halo mass functions and observed luminosity functions e.g. davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and references thereof .",
    "galaxies however , have many more properties than just their mass , most notably , galactic classification schemes center on sorting galaxies as ellipticals , lenticulars and spirals , subdividing the latter again into types , typically along the hubble sequence . in spite of the many well known virtues of this classification scheme , its somewhat subjective , qualitative and relative nature ,",
    "has made it difficult to use in comparisons against cosmological simulations , where the type of a modeled galaxy is rather difficult to assess , in terms of hubble s classification scheme .",
    "inspired by varied theoretical studies which invariably identify the @xmath0 spin parameter of a host halo as the principal physical parameter in determining the morphological and visual characteristics of a spiral galaxy , which are then subjectively integrated into the qualitative assignment of type , in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) two of us derived a simple estimate of @xmath0 for any observed spiral .",
    "there it was shown that the scalings of the derived @xmath0 against various type determining properties such as colour , disk thickness and bulge to disk ratio , are comparable to the corresponding scalings of these parameters against hubble type , using a large sample of nearby spirals .    it is interesting that a generic prediction of cosmological n - body simulations over the past 2 decades has been the functional form and parameters which define the predicted distribution of @xmath0 for dark matter halos e.g. bullock et al .",
    "nevertheless , it has not been easy to test this prediction directly , as @xmath0 is not a straight forward observable feature of a real galaxy .",
    "not only is a measurable @xmath0 distribution relevant as a test of the general structure formation scheme , but also as a further way of independently constraining cosmological parameters , which to a certain extent alter its details e.g. gardner ( 2001 ) .    having the approximate estimates of hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) ( henceforth hc06 ) , here we set out to measure empirical distributions of galactic @xmath0 spin parameters .",
    "firstly , given the approximate nature of these estimates , the only way of having signal adding up to something significant is through the use of very large samples . also , if we want a meaningful comparison against cosmological models , use of a volume limited sample is crucial .",
    "these two constraints drive us inevitably to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "two of us have worked extensively with this database , and recently constructed an interesting morphology segregation scheme of galaxies in the sdss in park & choi ( 2005 ) , henceforth pc05 .",
    "here we use a volume limited sample from the sdss having galaxies with redshifts in the interval @xmath3 , corresponding to distances of between @xmath4 mpc and @xmath5 mpc , assuming a wmap cosmology of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which we keep throughout .",
    "the following section includes a review of the derivation of @xmath0 spin parameters for spirals of hs06 , and gives our results for the spirals in our sdss sample .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath0 for spirals , galactic type through visual inspection and the colour and colour gradient morphology segregation scheme of pc05 is also made in section 2 , where we also present empirical distributions of galactic @xmath0 spin parameters for spirals .",
    "these are well fitted by a log - normal function , and give parameters in accordance with recent cosmological simulations . in section 3",
    "we extend the dimensional estimate of @xmath0 for ellipticals , and construct and analyze the empirical distributions of @xmath0 for the complete sample .",
    "our results are summarized in 4 .",
    "we are concerned with the determination of the dimensionless angular momentum parameter of a galactic halo :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the total energy , mass and angular momentum of the configuration , respectively . none of the quantities which appear in the above definition are accessible to direct observation . in hc05",
    "we derived a simple estimate of @xmath0 for disk galaxies in terms of observational parameters , which we summarize below .",
    "we shall model only two galactic components , the first one a disk having a surface mass density @xmath13 satisfying :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a radial coordinate and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two constants which are allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the total disk mass is now :    @xmath18    the second component will be a fixed dark matter halo having an isothermal @xmath19 density profile , and responsible for establishing a rigorously flat rotation curve @xmath20 throughout the entire galaxy , an approximation sometimes used in simple galactic evolution models e.g. naab & ostriker ( 2005 ) . under a flat rotation curve the disk specific angular momentum from eq([expprof ] ) will be @xmath21 , and the halo density will satisfy :    @xmath22    having a halo mass profile @xmath23 .",
    "we define the disk mass fraction as @xmath24 , expected to be of order @xmath25 or smaller ( e.g. flores et al .",
    "1993 , hernandez & gilmore 1998 ) , we shall use global parameters for the entire system indistinctly from halo parameters , consistent with having ignored disk self gravity in eq([rhohalo ] ) .",
    "we must now express @xmath0 in terms of structural galactic parameters readily accessible to observations .",
    "first we assume that the total potential energy of the galaxy is dominated by that of the halo , and that this is a virialized gravitational structure , which allows to replace @xmath10 in equation([lamdef ] ) for @xmath26 , one half the gravitational potential energy of the halo , given by :    @xmath27    assuming that the specific angular momenta of disk and halo are equal , @xmath28 ( as would be the case for an initially well mixed protogalactic state , and generally assumed in galactic formation models e.g. fall & efstathiou 1980 , mo et al .",

    "first , we note that by construction , what we are estimating is not strictly @xmath0 , but what has been defined as @xmath46 , the equivalent @xmath0 for a singular truncated isothermal halo .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath46 is slightly a function of halo structure , for example , for nfw profiles with concentration of 10 , one gets @xmath47 e.g. mo et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "this slight difference is smaller than the error introduced through the dispersion in the tully - fisher relation used , and will not be considered further , in any case , it is more rigorously @xmath46 and not @xmath0 that we will be talking about . also , it is clear that eq([lamobs ] ) is at best a first order approximation , and not a precise evaluation of @xmath0 for a real galaxy .",
    "however , in hc06 it was shown that this @xmath0 parameter shows a one - to - one correlation , with small dispersion , when compared to the input @xmath0 of detailed galactic formation models from two distinct cosmological groups . also , the scalings seen against colour , disk thickness and bulge to disk ratios , for a sample of nearby spirals from courteau ( 1996 , 1997 ) , de grijs ( 1998 ) and kregel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , similar to what is seen against hubble type , highlights the use of this parameter as a physical classification scheme .",
    "this is not surprising , as it is @xmath0 as defined by eq.([lamdef ] )",

    "gives @xmath61 , not in conflict with parameters for the milky way .",
    "for galaxies with large values of @xmath0 we expect thin systems , while galaxies with small values of @xmath0 will show thick disks , as the observed trend of ( @xmath48 ) decreasing in going from early - type disks to late type galaxies e.g. de grijs ( 1998 ) , yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) .",
    "having a way of estimating @xmath0 , we now need to define the optimal sample to use .",
    "as already mentioned , requiring as large as possible a volume limited sample makes the sdss an ideal database .",
    "since most published cosmological distributions of @xmath0 report data at @xmath62 , we will start by taking a volume - limited , absolute magnitude limited sample with @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 , in a low redshift range , @xmath66 , allowing an optimal comparison with reported cosmological studies .",
    "this sample contains 31,685 galaxies for which exponential disk scales , absolute magnitudes , velocity dispersions , de vacouleurs radii and eccentricities have been determined ( choi et al .",
    "it is important to note that the above structural parameters were determined in red and ir bands , in the spirit of obtaining global mass distribution parameters , it is clear that this is what is required for the measure of @xmath17 necessary in eq([lamobs ] ) .",
    "the first step is to identify the spiral galaxies in our sample .",
    "this is done using the colour , colour - gradient and concentration criteria developed in pc05 , where extensive testing and corroboration of the morphological segregation criteria were preformed against large training sets of visually classified galaxies .",
    "this procedure yields 21,184 spirals and 10,501 ellipticals .",
    "since we have no rotation curves for the spiral galaxies , as required by equation([lamobs ] ) , we must infer this through the absolute magnitudes of the observed systems , and use of an appropriate tully - fisher relation .",
    "hence , internal absorption in edge - on disks is a problem we must avoid .",
    "we prune the original sample to leave only spiral galaxies having axis ratios @xmath67 , this ensures only relatively face - on disks remain , minimizing errors in the absolute magnitudes used ( see choi et al .",
    "2006 for the choice of axis ratio cut ) . also , we use the red band tully - fisher relations of barton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to assign rotation velocities to observed galaxies .",
    "this relation shows a good fit to the data only in the range @xmath68 , so we must limit our galaxies to those falling in this range .",
    "the corresponding ranges we impose on inferred rotation velocities are @xmath69 in km / s , well within the range of applicability of the tully - fisher relation we are using .",
    "still , the dispersion in this tully - fisher , plus that in the baryonic tully - fisher used in deriving eq.([lamobs ] ) , leave us with a 25% uncertainty in our individual estimates of @xmath0 for spirals .    after applying the two cuts described above ,",
    "we are left with 0.366 of the original 21,184 spirals , 7,753 disk systems , still large enough to yield significant statistical information on the distribution , and small enough to include only galaxies for which our estimates of @xmath0 are most accurate .",
    "use of eq.([lamobs ] ) for this sample yields a collection of 7,753 values of @xmath0 for a complete volume limited sdss sample .",
    "having now a set of inferred , observational values of @xmath0 , we first explore the correlations of @xmath0 for spirals only , against the colour and colour - gradient information found by pc05 to be an accurate indicator of galactic type .",
    "figure ( 1 ) , taken from pc05 , shows some of the galaxies in our sample , with photos of galaxies representative of those found in each region , as visually classified by pc05 .",
    "notice the well defined cluster of ellipticals centered on @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "figure ( 2 ) shows all our spirals in a colour , colour - gradient plane , with the shading giving the average values of @xmath0 within each shaded square .",
    "we see that disks with high values of @xmath0 are found in the lower left hand area , whilst disks having low values of @xmath0 populate the right and upper regions .",
    "it is interesting that pc05 find precisely the same segregation pattern for late and early spirals , respectively , reinforcing the results of hc06 that the quantitative and objective @xmath0 parameter constructed in eq.([lamobs ] ) is a good physical classification parameter for spirals , reproducing the broad trends of the classical subjective , qualitative hubble sequence .",
    "next we use our collection of values of @xmath0 from our pruned sample of face - on spirals to construct a histogram , shown in figure ( 3 ) by the broken curve .",
    "the shape of this histogram suggests a log - normal distribution :    @xmath72 \\frac{d\\lambda}{\\lambda}\\ ] ]    the moments of the above distribution are analytical , which allows one to express :    @xmath73    @xmath74    from which one solves :    @xmath75^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    equating the 1st and 2nd order moments of our empirical distribution to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we find the best fit log - normal curve to our distribution for spiral galaxies .",
    "this is given by the smooth curve in figure ( 3 ) , where the empirical histogram has been rescaled to a unit integral .",
    "the parameters of the best fit distribution are : @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "both the form of this distribution and the particular values for the parameters we find are in good agreement with results from cosmological simulations , e.g. shaw et .",
    "al ( 2006 ) .    from figure ( 3 )",
    "it is apparent that the log - normal functional form is a good description of our inferred data , a more formal confirmation is provided by a k - s test .",
    "we construct the cumulative distribution functions for both the log - normal @xmath80 and our data out to @xmath81 , shown in figure ( 4 ) by the solid and dotted curves , respectively .",
    "these yield a maximum difference @xmath82 , and a significance given by :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 , @xmath85 the total number of points in our sample , 7,746 , giving @xmath86 and a significance level of @xmath87 .",
    "we hence see that our inferred distribution of galactic @xmath0 s is consistent with having come from the best fit log - normal @xmath80 , to a very high degree .",
    "we note the important precedent of syer et .",
    "al ( 1999 ) who using similar estimates for @xmath0 for spiral galaxies , using a sample from lauberts ( 1982 ) , find a distribution of values of @xmath0 well fitted by a log - normal function , with parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the small differences with our inference might come from their lack of a large volume limited unbiased sample , their lack of an attempt at modeling @xmath0 for ellipticals , which further limited the scope of comparisons which could then be made against cosmological n - body models , or their use of a disk formation model calibrated directly from cosmological n - body simulations .    from equation([lamtully ] ) we see that our inferred @xmath0 s are proportional to the constants @xmath90 , since the validity and constancy of the t - f relation is well established , we can think of our inferred @xmath0 s as @xmath91 , where @xmath36 is the baryon fraction of a spiral system .",
    "we have shown that under the simplest assumption of a constant @xmath40 , a log - normal distribution results from the data , clearly , any other constant @xmath36 will also yield a log - normal distribution , with the same @xmath92 , and a mean of @xmath93 .",
    "also , notice that most cosmological simulations yield distributions of @xmath0 being independent of mass ( e.g. bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) which if true , ensures our inferences will not be skewed by the velocity cuts applied to the spirals .    a baryon fraction being a strong function of @xmath17 or @xmath20 however , could easily result in a best fit @xmath94 no longer looking like a log - normal distribution . in the absence of any definitive handle on @xmath36 or its possible variations , we limit ourselves to concluding that a constant @xmath36 implies a log - normal @xmath80 for the spirals from the sdss we studied , while varying @xmath95 could doubtlessly imply something else .",
    "before attempting an empirical total distribution of @xmath0 s we must derive an estimate for this parameter for an elliptical galaxy , we propose a model equivalent to the one used for spirals , including only two components ; a baryonic matter distribution with a hernquist density profile and a dark matter halo having a singular , truncated isothermal profile .    in order to calculate the energy of the galaxy ,",
    "we assume that the total potential is dominated by the energy of the virialized dark matter halo . in principle",
    ", we expect that halos were elliptical galaxies are found are no different from those of disk galaxies ( white & rees , 1978 , kashlinsky , 1982 ) . in the case of a disk galaxy , the halo density profile has the form @xmath96 , with potential energy @xmath97 .",
    "the velocity @xmath98 is the circular velocity of an element in centrifugal equilibrium with the halo . in an elliptical",
    ", nothing is actually moving at that velocity , which still can be used to characterize the halo .",
    "the dependence on velocity can be changed to one on mass using again a baryonic tully - fisher relation ( gurovich et al , 2004 ) : @xmath99 , thinking that the dynamics of a halo host of an elliptical galaxy are the same as those of disk galaxies .",
    "finally , we define the baryonic mass fraction as @xmath100 to express the mass of the halo in terms of the baryonic mass . validating the above assumptions , we note the interesting new results of treu et .",
    "al ( 2006 ) and koopmans et .",
    "al ( 2006 ) who find trough dynamical studies of velocity dispersion in ellipticals , and direct inferences on the halos of the studied ellipticals through lensing measurements , 1 ) the presence of extensive dark halos and 2 ) that these halos have equivalent velocity dispersions equal to those of their galaxies , the dynamical equivalent of a flat rotation curve for ellipticals .    for the angular momentum , if we assume that the specific angular momenta of dark matter and baryons are equal , @xmath101 , we can obtain the angular momentum of the entire configuration using only the directly observable component .",
    "it is important to remember that the baryonic component is susceptible of dissipating , while dark matter is not , this will affect the above assumption and our @xmath0 estimates , being the value obtained a lower limit . in order to obtain the angular momentum of the baryonic distribution",
    ", we need to know the rotation velocity , information not always available due to technical observational difficulties and the fact that in many elliptical galaxies , the rotational velocity is at best of the same order as the velocity dispersion ( pinkney et al .",
    "2003 , sarzi et al .",
    "these forces us to determine the angular momentum of the system using some other observable parameter .",
    "in many works ( e.g. binney 1978 , franx et al .",
    "1991 ) it is shown that the ellipticity of a galaxy is related to its rotation velocity , more precisely to its angular momentum . by dimensional",
    "analysis we expect the specific angular momentum of the galaxy be proportional to @xmath102 and to the eccentricity @xmath103 of the galaxy in the i - band , as shown by gott & thuan ( 1976 ) and in marchant & shapiro ( 1977 ) . introducing a proportionality constant @xmath104 related to the details of the matter distribution , the specific angular momentum is given by :    @xmath105    with @xmath106 the de vacouleurs radius of the galaxy .",
    "the constant c can be calibrated from cases where we know the actual angular momentum of the system . for a small sample of 22",
    "closely studied elliptical galaxies , from halliday et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and pinkney et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we calculated the actual angular momentum , for a hernquist profile and using the reported values of rotational velocity . comparing with the angular momentum given by eq.([lel ] ) , we obtain @xmath107 .    for the galactic mass , using again the assumption that the gravitational structure is virialized , we compute the dynamical mass at @xmath108 , the half light radius , using the expression    @xmath109    from padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , where @xmath110 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "for elliptical galaxies it is well known that the presence of dark matter in the inner part of the galaxy is negligible so the total baryonic mass will be simply @xmath111 .",
    "now we have the tools to estimate the energy , the angular momentum and the mass of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "if we introduce this information into equation 1 , we obtain :    @xmath112    where we used values for @xmath37 and @xmath36 as calibrated in hc06 .",
    "the above is the equivalent expression of eq.([lamobs ] ) for elliptical galaxies , and has errors of 30% , due to the dispersion in the observational relations used .",
    "we must take into account that the values for eccentricity @xmath103 and radius @xmath106 , required must be the intrinsic parameters of the system , not the observed ones , as these will be systematically smaller due to projection effects .",
    "also in many ellipticals , shape is the result not exclusively of rotational support , but also of dynamical pressure support ( i.e. anisotropic velocity dispersion ) , with varying degrees of relative importance .",
    "hence , unknown dissipational and projection effects make eq.([lamel ] ) a lower limit , whilst the participation of pressure support make it an upper one . to what extent the above compensate",
    "each other is unclear , we shall therefore assume eq.([lamel ] ) must be multiplied by a factor which remains a free parameter of our method , @xmath113 .",
    "since ellipticals will generally have much lower values of @xmath0 than spirals , the relative mix of spirals and ellipticals will be an important factor in determining our final estimated distribution of galactic @xmath0 s .",
    "we must hence leave this relative fraction equal to that of the original sample , before the velocity and projection cuts were applied to the spirals , we further remove randomly selected ellipticals to reduce the total number of galaxies to 0.366 of the original number , leaving only 3,843 ellipticals .",
    "our final sample is composed of a total of 11,597 galaxies , large enough to yield significant statistical information on the distribution .    using eq.([lamel ] )",
    "we estimate @xmath0 for the ellipticals in the sample , after which we can add the two distributions to obtain the total empirical @xmath80 . as discussed previously , for ellipticals ,",
    "a degree of uncertainty remains , in connection to the ( varying ) degree of pressure support , the degree of dissipation of angular momentum in the baryonic component , and projection effects , which to 0th order we have incorporated as an unknown multiplicative factor @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath114 the result of adding the distribution of @xmath0 parameters for spirals and ellipticals is a distinctly double peaked @xmath80 , with the ellipticals coming in as a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath115 . in the interest of comparing with simulations",
    ", we shall take as a working hypothesis that the full @xmath80 should also be a log - normal distribution .",
    "we then adjust @xmath113 so as to obtain a log - normal total distribution , with the restriction that the values of @xmath0 for ellipticals should remain lower than those of spirals .",
    "the resulting histogram , requiring @xmath116 is shown by the broken curve in figure(6 ) , where the smooth solid curve gives a best fit log - normal curve to the full distribution , having parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "given that we have used empirical scaling relations , which show a measure of dispersion , we now take the pessimistic view that such dispersions are intrinsic to the data ( pessimistic in the sense that a measure of this dispersion is undoubtedly observational noise ) , and hence , propagate as errors into our estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "we now estimate what is the best underlying log - normal distribution , assuming that the histograms we obtained are only a degraded version of an intrinsic log - normal distribution .",
    "we determine the best intrinsic log - normal function through a full maximum likelihood analysis of the data .",
    "this is done for purposes of comparison against predicted @xmath0 distributions , we fix the functional form of the distribution , and set out only to evaluate the best fit parameters @xmath119 and @xmath92 from eq.([plam ] ) .",
    "we construct the likelihood function as the probability that an inferred set of @xmath120 empirical values of @xmath0 , @xmath121 , might arise from a given model , ( @xmath122 ) , as :    @xmath123    where :    @xmath124,\\ ] ]    @xmath125 is the center of a density distribution , the nominal inferred @xmath0 for the ith galaxy , @xmath126 the assigned error , and @xmath127 a normalization factor taking into account that no matter what the error , the domain of @xmath128 must always be the positive values of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we normalize @xmath129 as a truncated gaussian having unit integral , giving @xmath130 $ ] .    in the limit of the error in our inferred @xmath0 tending to zero , @xmath127 tends to 1 , and @xmath129 tends to a dirac delta function , reducing the integral in equation([likelyhood ] ) to an evaluation of @xmath80 at the inferred value .",
    "the advantage of a full likelihood formulation is that parameter inference can be preformed in a way which naturally incorporates the errors in the data sample , without the need of binning the data , a process which intrinsically reduces the information content of the sample .",
    "equation([likelyhood ] ) is then evaluated over a fine grid of values of ( @xmath119 , @xmath92 ) , and the point where the maximum is found selected as the best fit model . for the 7,753 spirals the result is ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) , with very small confidence intervals of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "although our errors in individual @xmath0 estimates are of 25% of @xmath0 , it is thanks to having a sample running into the thousands that we can retrieve details of the @xmath0 distribution with accuracy .    finally , we repeat the evaluation of eq.([likelyhood ] ) , but using this time the complete sample , of 11,597 spirals plus ellipticals . here",
    "@xmath0 for the ellipticals is taken as @xmath135 the estimate of eq.([lamel ] ) .",
    "this factor can not be much larger than what we are using , since then ellipticals would start overlapping significantly with spirals in their @xmath0 distributions , as mentioned previously , if this factor is much reduced , the total @xmath0 distribution becomes double peaked , with ellipticals appearing as a distinct population at very low @xmath0 , which would be hard to explain .",
    "the results this time are @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "a comparison of the maximum likelihood model and the collection of inferred @xmath0s is given in fig.(6 ) , which is analogous to fig.(3 ) , but includes the complete sample , binned into 150 discrete intervals .",
    "a direct fit of eq.([plam ] ) to the full data gives @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "the formal errors in the method are again of the order of what was found for the spirals , but this time we are dominated by the unknown correction factor between our estimate and the actual @xmath0 for ellipticals .",
    "this uncertainty , although bounded , dominates our final error estimates and yields @xmath138 in @xmath119 and @xmath139 in @xmath92 .",
    "another possible source of error in our estimates would be the existence of a large population of low surface brightness galaxies of high @xmath0 , which would lead to larger values of both @xmath119 and @xmath92 .",
    "the above results qualitatively agree with generic predictions of structure formation models regarding the predicted values for @xmath119 and @xmath92 , e.g. shaw et al .",
    "( 2006 ) review recent results from the literature giving values in the range @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the availability of empirical measurements of these parameters could serve as a further independent guideline for models of structure formation .",
    "we stress that for the full sample , the log - normal nature of both the inferred and the underlying @xmath0 distributions is an assumption which we can not confirm , taken only to permit a comparison with models . under this assumption ,",
    "the parameters of the distribution can be derived from the data .",
    "an inference of the actual functional form of the total distribution would require more solid constraints on the hypothesis introduced in the derivation of the @xmath0 s for ellipticals .",
    "however , we do note that any similar scheme modeling ellipticals as residing in halos equivalent to those of spirals , and having significantly lower angular momentum than spirals , will also yield a @xmath80 not very different from what is shown in figure ( 6 ) .",
    "we apply simple estimates of the @xmath0 spin parameter to a large volume limited sample from the sdss .",
    "the sample is split into ellipticals and spirals using colour , concentration and colour gradients .",
    "we find that for spiral galaxies , the average value of the inferred @xmath0 correlates well with standard type , as determined by visual inspection .",
    "this highlights the potential of @xmath0 as an objective and quantitative classification tool for spiral galaxies .    for",
    "the spiral galaxies sample we obtain a distribution which is statistically consistent with a log - normal distribution , as what is commonly found in cosmological n - body simulations , we find parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "ellipticals have , as expected , average values of @xmath0 an order of magnitude lower than spirals .",
    "the details of their @xmath0 distribution are harder to quantify , but average values of around @xmath142 are derived .",
    "if the distribution of @xmath0 parameters for the full sample is fitted by log - normal distribution , of the type found to reproduce the corresponding distribution of modeled halos arising in cosmological simulations , the parameters we find are : @xmath143 and @xmath144 , derived this time from a sample of real galaxies .",
