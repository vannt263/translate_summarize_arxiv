    "as noted in  @xcite , they enter @xmath55 .",

    "hence , when one wants to perform calculations including coulomb effects for small external momenta , one can no longer assume that all momenta scale with @xmath56 .",

    "we generically denote this scale by @xmath4 and assume @xmath57 for the power counting . as noted in  @xcite",

    "the coulomb contributions are small and the results in both schemes agree .    with this modified counting , it is not straightforward to deduce the scaling of loops anymore .",
    "kinetic energies always scale like @xmath41 , so the scaling of @xmath61 and the nucleon propagator is not modified in the presence of coulomb effects .",
    "however , where we could simply assume that all loop momenta scale like @xmath41 before , we now have to check first which contribution is picked up ( or rather enhanced ) after carrying out the @xmath61-integral . in general",

    "@xmath5 scattering involving the exchange of coulomb photons . ]    in this subsection , we discuss several diagrams contributing to @xmath4@xmath5 scattering that include coulomb photons ( see fig .",

    "we always assume @xmath67 .",
    "diagram ( a ) simply scales as @xmath68 .",

    "enter only as effective range corrections .",
    "diagram ( c ) contains two loops , which have to be analysed separately .",
    "the upper nucleon bubble does not contain any photon propagators , so there all momenta scale as @xmath41 . in the lower loop , momenta certainly scale @xmath70 due to the two photon propagators that involve the external momentum . including the remaining nucleon propagator , which cancels the contribution from the integration measure , we are left with a total scaling @xmath71 for diagram ( c ) .",
    "this means that compared to diagram ( b ) it is suppressed by a factor @xmath72 . for diagrams of the form ( c ) with more than two photons attached to the bubble we simply quote the results from  @xcite .",
    "the diagram with three photons could contribute with a factor @xmath73 , whereas the diagrams with @xmath74 photons attached to the bubble are even infrared finite and suppressed by factors @xmath75 . following  @xcite , we neglect them all and also the logarithmically - scaling diagram with three photons ( which is already small for @xmath76 ) .    diagram ( d ) is a little ambiguous since _ a priori _ it is not clear whether the loop momentum should scale @xmath77 or @xmath70 . in  @xcite , the first alternative is chosen , yielding that compared to the same diagram without the photon it is suppressed by a factor @xmath78 .",
    "a direct numerical calculation shows that it is a seven - percent effect at threshold .",
    "the diagram ( e ) obviously is irrelevant for the quartet - channel system ( there are never two protons in the dibaryon ) , but , at least in principle , it can play a role in the doublet - channel system .",
    "the power counting , however , yields the same suppression factor as for diagram ( c ) , only in this case the scaling of the loop momentum is not ambiguous .",
    "a direct numerical evaluation yields that at threshold it is a 15% contribution ( again compared to the simple nucleon - exchange diagram without the photon ) .",
    "we take this value as the _ a priori _ theoretical uncertainty of our doublet - channel calculation .",
    "the bottom line of the discussion above is that , as done in  @xcite , we iterate the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) to all orders and do not include any of the other diagrams shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coulombdiagrams ] .",
    "the claim is that this procedure is adequate for both the quartet - channel and the doublet - channel system .",
    "the coulomb effects are thus included at  accuracy in our calculation .",
    "we start with a review of @xmath8@xmath5 quartet - channel scattering , where the spin 1 of the deuteron and the spin @xmath79 of the nucleon couple to a total spin of @xmath80 . since this coupling is only possible when the spins of all three nucleons taking part in the reaction are aligned , the pauli principle applies .",
