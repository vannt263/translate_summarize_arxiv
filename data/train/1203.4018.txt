    "major advances in the detection and characterization of exoplanet atmospheres have been made over the last decade . to date , several dozen hot jupiter atmospheres have been observed by the _ spitzer space telescope _ , _ hubble space telescope _ and/or ground - based observations .",
    "observational highlights include the detection of molecules and atoms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the identification of thermal inversion @xcite .",
    "recent observational efforts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the continuous improvements in observational techniques will enable us to extend the field of atmospheric characterization to the regime of super - earths ( exoplanets with mass between 1 and 10 @xmath4 ) in the near future .",
    "since super - earth exoplanets lie in the intermediate mass range between terrestrial planets and the gas / ice giants in the solar system , compelling questions arise as to the nature and formation histories of these objects and whether they are capable of harboring life .",
    "a potential way of answering these questions is to constrain the molecular compositions and thicknesses of their atmospheres from spectral observations of the transmission and/or emission spectra @xcite .",
    "while a thick hydrogen / helium envelope would indicate that their formation histories are similar to those of the gas or ice giant planets in the solar system , super - earths that are predominately solid planets may be scaled - up analogs of the terrestrial planets in our solar system .",
    "alternative scenarios of planets different in nature to the solar system planets , such as planets mainly composed of water or carbon compounds , have been proposed as well @xcite .    as the first observations of the transmission spectrum of the super - earth gj  1214b become available ,",
    "the current practice in interpreting these spectra is to check the observations for their agreement to preconceived atmospheric scenarios @xcite .",
    "there are two dangers with this approach : first , even if a good fit is reached between the data and the model spectrum of a preconceived scenario , we do not know whether we actually understand the nature of the planet or whether we have simply found one out of several possible scenarios matching the data .",
    "second , and even more important , we will not be able to understand planets that do not fit our preconceived ideas .",
    "these planets , however , would likely represent the most compelling science cases as they may provide new insights into planetary formation and evolution , atmospheric chemistry , or astrobiology .    here , we present a new tool for the interpretation of transmission spectra of transiting super - earth and mini - neptune exoplanets .",
    "the approach is fundamentally different from previous work on super - earth atmospheres in that we retrieve constraints on the atmospheric composition by exploring a wide range of atmospheres with self - consistent temperature structures .",
    "our approach builds on the idea introduced in the pioneering works on hot jupiters by @xcite and @xcite to use monte carlo methods to explore the parameter space for solutions that are in agreement with the observations .",
    "the method presented here is different in three ways .",
    "first , our retrieval method is applicable to atmospheres of general composition and considers the presence of a cloud deck or solid surface .",
    "we introduce concepts of compositional data analysis , a subfield of statistical analysis , to treat the mixing ratios of all molecular constituents equally while ensuring that the sum of the mixing ratios is unity .",
    "second , we use a radiative - convective model to calculate a temperature profile that is self - consistent with the molecular composition of each model atmosphere .",
    "third , we conduct a full bayesian analysis and infer our constraints on atmospheric parameters directly by marginalizing the joint posterior probability distribution obtained from the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation .",
    "we therefore obtain the most - likely estimates and statistically significant bayesian credible intervals for each parameter .",
    "@xcite used the mcmc algorithm to explore the model parameter space in the search for regions that provide good fits to the data .",
    "based on the parameter exploration , they were able to report contours of constant goodness - of - fit in the parameters space .",
    "contours of constant goodness - of - fit , however , can not directly be related to the confidence regions of the desired parameters .    the retrieval method presented in this work is different from optimum estimation retrieval , as described by @xcite and recently applied to exoplanets by @xcite and @xcite , in that we derive the full probability distributions and bayesian credible regions for the desired atmospheric parameters , while optimum estimation retrieval assumes gaussian errors around a single best - fitting solution .",
    "highly non - gaussian uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters need to be considered for noisy exoplanet observations because the observable atmospheric spectra are highly nonlinear functions of the desired atmospheric parameters , and a large volume in the parameter space are generally compatible with noisy exoplanet spectra . our approach",
    "to calculate the joint posterior probability distribution using mcmc is computationally intensive ( @xmath5 model evaluations are required ) , but it enables us to extract all that can be inferred about the atmospheric parameters from the observational data .",
    "the uncertainty of individual atmospheric parameters introduced by complex , non - gaussian correlations to other parameters is accounted for in a straightforward way by marginalizing over the remaining parameters .",
    "optimum estimation retrieval , in contrast , searches for a single best - fitting solution using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "gaussian uncertainties are estimated around the best - fitting solution by linear analysis @xcite or by performing multiple retrieval runs with individual parameters fixed at particular values @xcite .",
    "optimum estimation retrieval requires fewer model evaluations ( typically @xmath6 per retrieval run , multiplied by the number of retrieval runs performed with individual parameters fixed ) and may therefore allow the use of more complex atmospheric models given the same computational resources . for noisy exoplanet spectra ,",
    "however , the optimal estimation retrieval may not correctly represent the confidence regions of the atmospheric parameters because the uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters are highly non - gaussian .    in this work",
    ", we investigate what we can learn about the atmospheres of super - earths solely based on transmission spectroscopy by applying the retrieval method to a sample of synthetic observations of different super - earth scenarios .",
    "previous studies have shown that the atmospheric composition as well as the presence of a solid surface and clouds affect the planetary spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no comprehensive study of the degeneracy of these effects has been performed . as a result , it is not fully understood which individual atmospheric parameters can be inferred _ uniquely _ from the spectrum and which parameters are strongly correlated or degenerate . in particular , for super - earth atmospheres for which the formation history and subsequent evolution is not understood , we do not know the mean molecular mass and the thickness of the atmosphere a priori . for such planets , the depths of individual absorption features in the spectrum are affected not only by the mixing ratio of the absorbing molecular species , but also by the unknown mean molecular mass of the background atmosphere and the surface or cloud deck pressure .",
    "strong correlations or degeneracies between these atmospheric properties are therefore expected , but have not been addressed sufficiently in the literature .",
    "the paper outline is as follows .",
    "we introduce the new retrieval method in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the synthetic observations of the super - earth scenarios . in section 4",
    ", we introduce a conceptual picture of the information contained in transmission spectra and present numerical results .",
    "section 5 discusses the overall approach to obtain atmospheric constraints from observations and expands on the effect of hazes and stratified atmospheres .",
    "we also discuss a new way of planning observations using our atmospheric retrieval method , and comment on the complementarity between atmospheric retrieval and self - consistent modeling of atmospheres . in section 6 , we present a summary of our results and the conclusions .",
    "our eventual aim is to characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets based on observations of their transmission spectra and without prior knowledge of their natures .",
    "the primary inputs to the retrieval method are observations of the wavelength - dependent transit depth during the primary transit .",
    "the outputs are the best estimates and confidence regions of the desired atmospheric properties , such as the mixing ratios of the molecular constituents and the surface / cloud - top pressure .",
    "we solve the inverse problem to regular atmospheric modeling , in which the transmission spectrum is calculated given a description of the composition and state of the atmosphere .",
    "the essential part of defining the retrieval problem is to specify a set of parameters that both unambiguously defines the state of atmospheres and may be constrained by transit observations .",
    "we employ an atmospheric forward model to represent the physical relation between the set of atmospheric parameters and the observable transit depths .",
    "given a set of observations , we retrieve constraints on atmospheric parameters by performing a bayesian analysis using the atmospheric forward model and the mcmc technique . the joint posterior probability distribution provided by the mcmc simulation represents the complete state of knowledge about the atmospheric parameters in the light of the observational data .",
    "we propose a parametric description of the atmosphere guided by the information available in exoplanet transmission spectra .",
    "our approach is to treat the atmosphere near the terminator as a well - mixed , one - dimensional atmosphere and describe the unknown molecular composition , thickness , and albedo of this atmosphere by free parameters .",
    "the motivation for treating the atmosphere as well - mixed is to keep the number of parameters to a minimum to avoid overfitting of the sparse data available in the near future , while ensuring that all atmospheric properties that considerably affect the retrieval from the spectrum are described by free parameters . for atmospheres with a stratified composition",
    ", the retrieval method determines an altitude - averaged mixing ratio that best matches the observed transmission spectrum ( section [ sub : well - mixed - atmosphere ] ) .",
    "the unknown temperature profile at the terminator presents a challenge . while the pressure dependence of the temperature profile has only a secondary effect on the transmission spectrum and",
    "can likely not be retrieved given that the molecular composition is unknown a priori , the temperature does affect the scale height and may affect the constraints on other parameters .",
    "our approach is not to retrieve the temperature profile , but to account for the uncertainty introduced by the unknown temperature on the retrieved composition and surface pressure .",
    "we therefore introduce a free parameter for the planetary albedo and calculate the temperature profile consistent with the molecular composition and the planetary albedo for each model atmosphere . in the mcmc analysis , the albedo is then allowed to vary over the range of plausible planetary albedos .",
    "marginalizing the posterior distribution over all albedo values allows us to account for the uncertainty of the composition and surface pressure introduced by the unknown albedo .",
    "our proposed model has the following free parameters .",

    "the volume mixing ratio @xmath7 ( or equivalently the mole fraction ) is defined as the number density of the constituent @xmath8 divided by the total number density of all constituents in the gas mixture @xmath9 .",
    "no assumptions on the elemental composition , chemistry , or formation and evolution arguments are made .",
    "in contrast to the work on hot jupiters by @xcite , we can not assume a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere .",

    "the objective of the atmospheric forward model is to generate transmission spectra for a wide range of different atmospheric compositions and thicknesses . given a set of atmospheric parameters ( section [ sub : parametrization ] ) , our model uses line - by - line radiative transfer in local thermodynamic equilibrium , hydrostatic equilibrium , and a temperature profile consistent with the molecular composition to determine the transmission spectrum .",

    "we perform multiple independent parallel - tempering simulations of the target probability distribution with starting points dispersed throughout the entire parameter space .",
    "one challenge in atmospheric retrieval is that even for the most simple atmospheric parameterizations , some parameters describing the composition and state of the atmosphere might not be constrained well by the observations . in this regime , it is important to choose an appropriate , non - informative prior probability distribution on the parameters .",
    "one advantage of the bayesian approach over traditional frequentist approaches is that we can explicitly state our choice of the prior probability distribution .",
    "many approaches , e.g. , constant-@xmath67 boundaries , usually implicitly assume a uniform prior . while in many cases",
    "the uniform prior seems like a reasonable choice , it is worth noting that the uniform prior is variant under reparameterization . for example , a uniform prior for @xmath68 will not be a uniform prior for @xmath69 @xcite , therefore the obtained results can depend on the choice of parameterization .    in this work , we use a uniform prior on the radius ratio parameter , @xmath70 , and the planetary albedo , @xmath71 . the surface pressure , @xmath10 , is a scale parameter for which we do not know the order of magnitude a priori .",
    "we therefore choose a jeffrey prior for the surface pressure , i.e. , a uniform prior for @xmath72 .",
    "since an infinite surface pressure may agree with the observational data in the same way a sufficiently high finite value does , the posterior distribution can remain unnormalizable unless a normalizable prior distribution is chosen . to ensure a normalizable posterior , we set an upper bound on the prior at @xmath73 .",
    "higher surface pressures are not considered because atmospheres of plausible compositions will be optically thick to the grazing star light at higher pressure levels .",
    "the mixing ratios of the molecular gases are also scale parameters , suggesting that the usage of a jeffrey prior for each of the mixing ratios would be appropriate .",
    "the constraint that the mixing ratios must add up to unity , however , prevents the assignment of a jeffrey prior for the individual mixing ratio .",
    "we therefore introduce a reparameterization as discussed in the following section .      since the mixing ratios of the molecular species in the atmosphere present parts from a whole",
    ", they must satisfy the constraints @xmath74    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the number of gases in the atmosphere . for the statistical analysis of the mixing ratios , it is important to recognize that the sample space of a composition is _ not _ the full euclidean space @xmath77 , for which most statistical tools were developed , but only the restricted ( @xmath78)-dimensional space formally known as the simplex of @xmath76 parts , @xmath79 .",
    "the simplex includes only sets of mixing ratios for which the components sum up to 1 . as a result ,",

    "the mixing ratio of the @xmath76th species @xmath80 can be calculated directly from the mixing ratios @xmath81 .    in this subsection",
    ", we present a reparameterization for the mixing ratios that allows for efficient sampling of the full simplex with mcmc , while ensuring that all @xmath76 molecular species may range across the complete detectable range , e.g. , @xmath82 , with a non - zero prior probability , and that the results are permutation invariant , i.e. , independent of which molecule was chosen to be the @xmath76th species .",
    "previous work on atmospheric retrieval implicitly accounted for the constraints in equations ( [ eq : ] ) and ( [ eq:-1 ] ) by using free parameters only for mixing ratios of the minor atmospheric gases and assuming that the remainder of the atmosphere is filled with the a - priori known main constituent .",
    "this approach is feasible for the inference of gas mixing ratios in hot jupiters and solar system planets because the main constituents of the atmospheres , i.e. , @xmath83 , are known a priori . in a bayesian retrieval approach ,",

    ", we can always determine a lower limit on the atmospheric mass once we have detected spectral features , but determining an upper limit is only possible if the atmosphere is sufficiently thin for the surface to be detected and an opaque cloud deck can be excluded from theoretical principles .",

    "only the direct interpretation of observations can tell us about the existence of such unusual atmospheric compositions .",
    "the identification of absorption lines of the @xmath192 absorption without constraining the high mixing ratio would not be a biosignature because low abundances of @xmath192 can be a result of photochemical composition .    in this work , we have shown that we can quantitatively constrain the atmospheric composition based on observations of the transmission spectrum , even for super - earth planets for which the composition is completely unknown a priori .",
    "transmission spectroscopy is a good tool for retrieval of the composition because the absorber amount and mean molecular mass are the main drivers determining the features of the transmission spectrum , while the influence of the unknown temperature profile is secondary .",
    "we also find , however , that the characterization of super - earth planets requires considerably more spectral coverage and precision than the characterization of the hydrogen - dominated atmospheres of hot jupiters .",
    "this is not only because of the smaller signal , but also because of a more complex parameter space that can result in degeneracies .",
    "photochemically - produced hazes may have a significant opacity at short wavelengths and may mask the signature of molecular rayleigh scattering if they are present in the upper atmosphere , . while we may still be able to probe the near - infrared spectrum and identify molecular absorbers , we will not be able to probe the transit depth offset of rayleigh scattering due to _ molecular _ scattering . without making further assumptions",
    ", we will , therefore , lose the ability to constrain the mixing ratio of the molecular species over orders of magnitude , even for the major constituents of the atmosphere ( see section [ sub : atmospheric - composition ] ) .    by measuring either the slope of the rayleigh scattering signature or the shapes of molecular absorption features",

    "we will not , however , be able to constrain the total amount of the spectrally inactive gases .",
    "since the near - infrared spectrum only constrains the _ relative _ abundances of the _ absorbing _ gases ( section [ sub : abundance - ratios - of ] ) , we can hypothesize different atmospheric mixtures of @xmath83 , @xmath135 , and absorbing gases in the correct ratiosthat produce nearly identical transmission spectra . as a result",
    ", we obtain a degeneracy that prevents us from constraining the molecular abundances uniquely .    one assumption that could be made",

    "our parameterization of the atmosphere in the retrieval process assumes a well - mixed atmosphere .",
    "given the limited amount of data available in the near - future , the motivation for the assumption of well - mixed atmospheres is to keep the number of free parameters , which make use of similar information in the spectrum , small .",
    "observations of the solar system planets justify the approach because @xmath19495% of the gas in each of the solar system atmospheres is composed of long - lived , chemically stable species that were mixed by turbulence and diffusion for a sufficiently long time ( see * ? ? ?",

    "if exquisite observations become available in the future , however , it may be useful to extend the parameterization to retrieve compositional gradients . for some molecular species ,",
    "such gradients may be identified as biomarkers caused by sources at or in the planetary surface .",
    "physical effects that lead to compositional stratifications of the gaseous species in the solar system atmospheres are ( 1 ) condensation of gases that condense at pressure and temperature levels encountered in the atmosphere , or ( 2 ) production or destruction of gas by photochemistry or geology , or ( 3 ) variation of chemical equilibrium with altitude due to the altitude dependencies of pressure and temperature .",
    "changes of gas concentration with altitude that are caused by condensation , however , are usually not relevant for our retrieval because transmission spectroscopy only probes layers above the condensation clouds .",
    "similarly , strong changes in the chemical equilibrium usually occur at deep levels in thick envelopes that are unlikely to be probed in transmission .",
    "in addition , the mixing ratios of gases that do vary with altitude often only vary over less than one order of magnitude , e.g. , co , @xmath189 , @xmath195 in the atmosphere of venus @xcite .",
    "observational data that are less noisy than the synthetic _ jwst _ observations considered in section [ sub : quantitative - constraints - on ] are necessary to robustly detect such gradients because the retrieved mixing ratios for minor species in the synthetic _ jwst _ observations are uncertain to within one order of magnitude , even for well - mixed atmospheres ( section [ sub : quantitative - constraints - on ] ) .",
    "photochemistry or surface sources , however , may lead to concentration gradients that are substantial at pressure levels probed by transmission spectroscopy ( e.g. , ozone in earth s atmosphere ) and may justify extensions to our parameterization in the future .    for atmospheres with a stratified composition",

    ", therefore , estimate a posterior at which pressure level we have probed the atmospheric mixing ratio of the gas .",
    "additional applications of the retrieval method presented here are ( 1 ) to evaluate and optimize observational strategies in the planning and proposal process of exoplanet observations and ( 2 ) to guide the design of future telescopes and instrumentation for the characterization of exoplanets .",
    "numerical studies using the retrieval method can provide concrete guidelines on how many transits must be observed and what spectral range and spectral resolution is ideal for a specific atmospheric characterization .",
    "the motivation behind the approach is that observational characterizations of super - earth atmospheres are extremely challenging and the observation of many transits with highly capable observatories will be required .    while the retrieval method is not essential to recognize the need for higher s / n data than currently available , the retrieval method is critical to determining exactly what magnitude of data is required for a useful atmospheric characterization .",
    "gj  1214b is a good example : in the past , 1 or 2 transits were observed at different wavelengths by various observers with the goal to characterize the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "even though some of these observations approached the theoretical photon limit , few constraints on the atmosphere could be found .",
    "retrieval analysis on simulated data shows that ten or more transits are required with currently available observatories in order to separate out the two currently most plausible scenarios of a water world and a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere with high - altitude clouds ( b. benneke et al .",

    "we propose a new paradigm in planning observations in which retrieval analysis of synthetic observations can quantitatively justify the necessity of large campaigns with ground - based or space - based observatories for atmospheric characterization .    a conceptually understanding of which details in the spectrum are required to constrain the atmospheric composition will enable observers to rationally select the wavelength ranges and spectral resolutions of transit observations for atmospheric characterization .",
    "for example , constraining the volume mixing ratios of molecular absorbers in super - earth atmospheres will require measuring the rayleigh scattering signature in addition to the molecule s absorption signatures in the infrared .",
    "if the rayleigh scattering signature is not observed , even low - noise observations of the spectral features in the near - infrared with _ jwst _ will not provide the information required to determine the volume mixing ratios .",

    "* the retrieval of the mixing ratios of spectrally inactive gases is fundamentally limited to two independent components .",
    "an inherent degeneracy arises if the atmosphere contains three or more independent spectrally inactive gases because the same mean molecular mass and the same strength of the rayleigh scattering signature can be obtained with different combinations of the gases .",
    "* non - gaussian treatments of the uncertainties of atmospheric parameters are essential for atmospheric retrieval from noisy exoplanet observations . even given low - noise synthetic observations as considered in this work ,",
    "only one - sided bounds and highly non - gaussian correlations exist for some atmospheric parameters .",
    "non - gaussian effects will become stronger for observational data sets noisier than the synthetic data considered in this work because the relation between the observables and the desired atmospheric parameters is highly nonlinear and larger volumes of the parameter space become compatible with noisier observations .",
    "a limitation of optimum estimation retrieval @xcite for the analysis of noisy exoplanet spectra is , therefore , that the extent of the confidence regions of atmospheric properties can not correctly be described by gaussian errors around a single best - fitting solution .",
    "our findings indicate that the retrieval method presented here , combined with low - noise observations , will provide the opportunity to observationally characterize atmospheres of individual super - earth planets and uniquely identify their molecular and elemental compositions .",
    "similar to observational constraints on the atmospheres of the solar system planets obtained over the last decades , the quantitative constraints obtainable with our atmospheric retrieval will generally be independent of preconceived ideas of atmospheric physics and chemistry as well as planet formation scenarios and atmospheric evolution .",
    "the unbiased constraints can , therefore , motivate the detailed study of the new phenomena in atmospheric dynamics and chemistry , identify habitability and biosignatures , or provide clues to planet formation and atmospheric evolution .",

    "for thin or cloudy atmospheres the change in the transit depth across the spectrum , @xmath147 , as proposed by @xcite , can not be used to uniquely constrain the mean molecular mass because clouds , hazes , and a surface also affect the feature depths . here",
    ", we show that measuring the linear slope of the rayleigh scattering signature or the shapes of individual features , instead , does provide constraints on the atmosphere scale height and can be used to estimate the mean molecular mass for general atmospheres independently of other atmospheric properties .",
    "we derive an algebraic solutions that can be used to infer the mean molecular mass directly from the transmission spectrum .    from the geometry described by @xcite",
    ", we obtain the slant optical depth , @xmath41 , as a function of the impact parameter , @xmath42 , by integrating the opacity through the planet s atmosphere along the observer s line of sight :      here , @xmath139 is the radial distance from the center of the planet . for rayleigh scattering ,",
    "the extinction cross section is only very weakly dependent on pressure and temperature , and we can assume @xmath200 .",
    "furthermore , motivated by hydrostatic equilibrium , we assume that the atmospheric number density falls off exponentially according to @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the atmospheric scale height . with these assumptions we can analytically perform the integration in equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) and obtain      where the modified bessel function of the second kind @xmath204 is approximated by its asymptotic form @xmath205 $ ] for large @xmath69 @xcite . for spectral regions ,",
    "for which the atmosphere is optically thick , the surface does not affect the transmission spectrum and the observed planet radius as a function of wavelength can be approximated as      because the number density falls exponentially with altitude leading to steep increase in @xmath207 as a function of @xmath42 .",
