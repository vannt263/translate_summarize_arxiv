    "considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding the fundamental processes involved in gas - surface interactions .",
    "this has been based on the parallel developments of large - scale electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory , combined with multi - dimensional quantum and classical analysis of the dynamics @xcite . despite these advances there remains one key area that is still largely unexplored and poorly understood ; the process of energy dissipation into substrate degrees of freedom .",
    "although this is known to be of central importance in many situations @xcite , there exist no ` real ' calculations to date for the energy loss to either phonons or electrons in the surface .",
    "in particular there have been a number of recent experiments that have shown convincing evidence that energy dissipation by the creation of electron - hole pairs is a significant effect in gas - surface dynamics .",
    "gostein et al @xcite carried out a detailed state - to - state analysis of h@xmath2 scattering from pd(111 ) and showed that , for example , in the vibrational relaxation of ( @xmath3 ) to ( @xmath4 ) an average of 120 mev is lost to the substrate during the scattering event , presumably to electron - hole pair formation .",
    "nienhaus and co - workers @xcite measured directly the hot electrons and holes created at ag and cu surfaces by the adsorption of thermal hydrogen and deuterium in the form of ` chemicurrents ' in a schottky diode .",
    "finally , huang et al @xcite have studied no scattering from au(111 ) and have concluded that the main sink of energy for the vibrational relaxation of @xmath5 molecules is the surface , with the strong dependence of the de - excitation probability on incident energy providing evidence that an electron - hole pair mechanism is the dominant factor .",
    "we carry out a calculation of the ground state properties of an interacting surface / molecule system using a plane - wave basis and a super - cell geometry , and use these results to evaluate the friction coefficient associated with the motion of a molecule at a chosen position and in a direction of choice .",
    "this is achieved using the well established ` golden rule ' expression @xcite that may be obtained by applying time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) together with a quasi - static limit @xcite , or less stringently by applying the golden rule directly to the available kohn - sham states @xcite .",
    "essentially the theory is as described by hellsing and persson @xcite or liebsch @xcite .",
    "the super - cell method has the advantage that it retains the continuous spectrum of one - electron excitations , unlike cluster models @xcite , and this is important for the interactions considered here . in first principles calculations of molecule - surface systems a super - cell of sufficient size",
    "is usually chosen to prevent any significant interaction between the adsorbates in neighbouring super - cells .",
    "when considering electron - hole pair excitation a slightly more subtle effect must be taken into account , arising from the enforced periodicity of the perturbation that produces the electron - hole pairs .",
    "we are primarily interested in the energy loss by electron - hole pair excitation due to the motion of an isolated molecule interacting with the surface , whereas the super - cell geometry will naturally describe the damping of an ordered over - layer . for the periodic system , conservation of crystal momentum",
    "prevents transitions occurring that will occur for an isolated molecule interacting with the surface .",
    "results for an isolated molecule are derived from the available periodic perturbation , and a significant difference is found between the energy loss behaviour of the periodic and isolated systems .    to test our method we investigate the friction coefficient of an h atom above the hcp hollow site of a cu(111 ) surface .",
    "spin is included explicitly in the kohn - sham theory using the gradient corrected local spin density approximation for exchange - correlation ( lsda - gc ) . in the next section the evaluation of the dynamic self - energy and friction coefficient from kohn - sham results using a plane - wave basis",
    "is described . in section [ sec : alg ] the implementation of this as a parallel algorithm is described , along with a brief description of the performance of the algorithm . results for h / cu(111 )",
    "are discussed in section [ sec : results ] , and section [ sec : conc ] is the conclusion .",
    "the experimentally measurable energy loss spectrum for a particular mode is directly related to the dynamic self - energy , @xmath6 .",
    "since we are interested in the energy loss , the imaginary part of this self - energy is the required quantity and this can be expressed using @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the kohn - sham wavefunctions and energies resulting from a density - functional description of the ground state , and @xmath10 is the fermi - dirac occupation function .",
    "spin degeneracy is assumed in eq .",
    "( [ e2.1 ] ) , hence the factor of 2 ; the extension to spin polarised systems is straightforward .",
    "the effective field , @xmath11 , is the tddft effective field with contributions from the field of the displaced nuclei , the coulomb field of the induced charge density and a contribution from exchange - correlation .",
    "equation ( [ e2.1 ] ) can be derived by direct application of the golden - rule and a single electron approximation @xcite , or through tddft with the assumption of a slow time - dependent perturbation ( see @xcite and @xcite for more clarification of the role of tddft ) .",
    "equation ( [ e2.1 ] ) provides the rate of energy loss of a mode of frequency @xmath12 due to the excitation of electron - hole pairs as @xmath13 . taking the quasi - static limit @xmath14 results in the rate of energy loss for the motion of the atom , and",
    "this can be expressed as the friction coefficient @xmath15 defined via the standard langevin equation .",
    "for motion in the direction @xmath16 , @xmath15 is given by ( see hellsing and persson @xcite , or plihal and langreth @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fermi energy , @xmath19 is the mass of the molecule , and @xmath20 is the static limit of @xmath21 given by the derivative of the kohn - sham self - consistent potential in the direction @xmath16 .    equation ( [ e2.2 ] ) is evaluated using wavefunctions of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the volume of the super - cell , and only the wavefunctions sampled at a finite number of @xmath0 points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone are available . the change in the kohn - sham potential due to the motion of an isolated atom is not directly available from a super - cell calculation , but we can obtain the change due the motion of a periodic lattice of atoms , @xmath24 , as a finite difference .      to calculate the dynamic interaction of an isolated molecule with a surface within a super - cell geometry care must be taken with the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ e2.1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is obtained directly as a periodic function , drastic consequences result - the integral becomes zero for @xmath25 .",
    "this is due to the super - cell geometry enforcing a conservation of crystal momentum that would be correct for describing the interaction of a real over - layer of molecules in coherent motion , but is not physically realistic for the aperiodic single molecule / surface system that concerns us here . in light of this",
    "we must obtain the change in the kohn - sham potential due to the motion of an isolated molecule , @xmath26 , from the change due to the coherent motion of an over - layer , @xmath24 .",
    "the relationship between the two can be found by applying linear response theory @xcite . although the theory is given here for a local pseudopotential , the generalisation to non - local pseudopotentials is straightforward .",
    "we begin by considering the change in the total pseudopotential , @xmath27 , due to an infinitesimal change in the position of the atom in each super - cell , @xmath28 . with the pseudopotential due to an atom at @xmath29 denoted",
    "@xmath30 this takes the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a lattice vector .",
    "the change in the kohn - sham potential can be obtained from @xmath33 via the static inverse dielectric function , @xmath34 that corresponds to the original kohn - sham calculation @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath35 or @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the derivative of the kohn - sham potential with respect to the change in the position of an atom at @xmath38 .",
    "for an isolated atom we require @xmath39 , the change in the kohn - sham potential due to the change in the position of an atom at @xmath29 .",
    "the formally correct way to obtain this is to obtain @xmath40 from the original dft calculation ( for an example of this type of calculation see godby et al @xcite ) , obtain @xmath41 , and use this to evaluate @xmath42 however , provided @xmath41 is well localised around the site of the perturbed atom such that there is little overlap between the responses to the motion of atoms in adjacent unit cells we may take @xmath43 where @xmath44 within a wigner - seitz cell centred on the perturbed atom , and is zero elsewhere .    from the super - cell calculation the kohn - sham potential for the atom at @xmath45",
    "is evaluated to obtain @xmath20 as @xmath46_{{\\bf x}+{\\bf h}}-          [ v^{\\mathrm{ks}}_{\\mathrm{lattice } } - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{{\\bf x}-{\\bf h } } \\right ) \\label{e2.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variation of the zero of the kohn - sham potential has been corrected for using the fermi energy associated with the self - consistent results for each atomic position .",
    "equation ( [ e2.3 ] ) will be accurate providing the response is isolated within the wigner - seitz cell centred on the perturbed atom ( or , equivalently , @xmath47 is negligible at the border of this wigner - seitz cell ) , and @xmath48 is small enough . in practice",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) corresponds to reducing the volume of integration in eq .",
    "( [ e2.1 ] ) from the entire lattice to one wigner - seitz cell . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] the consequences of considering the motion of an isolated atom , as described above , are investigated by comparing results with those obtained by treating the motion as that of an ordered over - layer of atoms .      a plane - wave calculation results in a set of kohn - sham states on a finite grid ( in real space or reciprocal space ) sampled at a finite number of @xmath0 points and for a finite number of bands , hence we must obtain the discrete equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) to evaluate @xmath15 .",
    "it is also desirable to apply the space - group symmetry to reduce the number of @xmath0 points that must be considered .",
    "this is achieved as follows .",

    "@xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an energy parameter describing the width of the function , and @xmath56 .    to obtain @xmath15",
    "we take @xmath57 , resulting in @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60 derivative of the ` squashed fermi - dirac ' function , and we have taken the static limit of @xmath11 .",
    "equation ( [ e2.7b ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) in the zero temperature and continuum limit .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) can not be directly discretised by replacing the @xmath61 functions with @xmath62 as this corresponds to taking the continuum and zero temperature limits before discretisation .",
    "this would result in the inclusion of a contribution to @xmath15 from transitions that should not be present ( such as from a state to itself ) .",
    "next we reduce the @xmath0 points that must be considered to those within the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone using the space - group of the lattice .",
    "since the set of @xmath0 points possess point group symmetry eq .",
    "( [ e2.7b ] ) immediately takes the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes a sum over points in the irreducible wedge , and @xmath65,@xmath66 are space - group operators composed of a unitary transformation , @xmath67 , and a non - symmorphic translation , @xmath68 .",
    "the number of operators in the space - group is denoted by @xmath69 , and @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of distinct @xmath0 points in the entire brillouin zone created by applying the complete set of @xmath69 space group operators to the point @xmath0 in the irreducible wedge .",
    "there are no symmetry operators associated with the eigenvalues since @xmath72 . transforming the integrand in real space by @xmath73 and using the identity @xcite @xmath74 results in @xmath75 where repeated sums over the same operator are removed and @xmath20 is required to possess the space - group symmetry corresponding to the available @xmath0 points .",
    "this requirement means that the original kohn - sham calculations must be performed with symmetry low enough to allow the motion of the atom in the direction we are interested in , even if the instantaneous position of the atom corresponds to a higher symmetry . in practise",
    "we also only calculate the quantities within the sum where the @xmath76 factor is greater than some small value , preventing the cost of calculating matrix elements that make negligible contribution to @xmath15 and limiting the sum to a finite number of bands .",
    "for the the motion of an over - layer of atoms , where @xmath20 is periodic , a similar treatment results in @xmath77 where only @xmath78 transitions contribute .    in order to obtain the matrix elements we require the kohn - sham states corresponding to the images of the available @xmath0 points under transformation by a point group operator , @xmath79 .",
    "transforming @xmath80 in reciprocal space gives us the coefficients of each @xmath79 , and this is achieved by applying eq .",
    "( [ e2.9 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ e2.4 ] ) and projecting out the required coefficients to give @xmath81 the wavefunctions in real space are then obtained using a fft @xmath82\\ ] ] and the required integrals are evaluated as sums over a unit cell ( this is analytically correct for a plane - wave basis ) .",
    "this cell must be chosen such that @xmath20 is negligible at its borders and such that the ` truncated ' potential possesses the correct space - group symmetry . as mentioned",
    "previously the ideal choice is a wigner - seitz cell centred at the interacting atom , as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a @xmath83 hexagonal unit cell with the atom of interest at @xmath84 .",
    "integration must be performed over the wigner - seitz unit cell centred at @xmath84 ( dashed line ) . for the parallelogram ( which represents the originally chosen unit cell )",
    "the function @xmath20 is not localised within the unit cell , and does not possess space - group symmetry . ]    to perform the sum it is necessary to divide the integration volume into different regions @xmath85 such that transforming region @xmath85 by a vector @xmath86 constructs the wigner - seitz cell from the original unit cell .",
    "the matrix element then takes the form @xmath87 where @xmath20 and the wavefunctions are available over a grid of @xmath88 real space points , @xmath89 .    it should be noted that for an isolated atom the integral is carried out over one unit cell as a consequence of @xmath90 being localised in that cell , whereas for the coherent motion of an over - layer the integral is carried out over one unit cell as a consequence of the periodicity of the integrand .",
    "hence , to evaluate @xmath91 the rearrangement of eq .",
    "( [ e2.13 ] ) is not necessary .",
    "we are interested in large scale systems , hence a parallel implementation of both the original kohn - sham calculation and the evaluation of @xmath15 is desirable . multiprocessor algorithms for plane - wave kohn - sham methods are available , so we describe the latter only .",
    "first we consider the distribution of data between the @xmath92 available processors .",
    "these are divided into @xmath93 groups of @xmath94 processors , and the @xmath0 points are distributed equally between these groups of processors .",
    "data specific to a @xmath0 point is stored on the associated group .",

    "the speedup of the parallel fft with increasing number of processors is complex and depends on the architecture of the parallel system @xcite , but some general conclusions about how this effects the performance of the entire algorithm can be made .",
    "if a linear speedup of the fft with respect to the available processors ( @xmath132 ) occured then the total run time would be independent of the distribution of the processors among @xmath0 and @xmath1 points .",
    "however , the actual speedup will be worse than linear due to the communication times , so for a given @xmath92 the best efficiency is achieved when the @xmath0 points are distributed amongst as many processors as possible , or @xmath133 is as small as possible .",
    "test calculations have been carried out for a h atom moving above the hcp hollow site of a cu(111 ) surface .",

    "<S> a method for the calculation of the damping rate due to electron - hole pair excitation for atomic and molecular motion at metal surfaces is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical basis is provided by time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) in the quasi - static limit and calculations are performed within a standard plane - wave , pseudopotential framework . </S>",
    "<S> the artificial periodicity introduced by using a super - cell geometry is removed to derive results for the motion of an isolated atom or molecule , rather than for the coherent motion of an ordered over - layer . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm is implemented in parallel , distributed across both @xmath0 and @xmath1 space , and in a form compatible with the castep code . </S>",
    "<S> test results for the damping of the motion of hydrogen atoms above the cu(111 ) surface are presented . </S>"
