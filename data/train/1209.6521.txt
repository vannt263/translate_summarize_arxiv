    "consider the problem of motion of two point particles with masses @xmath0 , @xmath1 in the absence of external forces ( the two - body problem ) . here and in",
    "what follows , all parameters belonging to the first particle will be labeled by index `` 1 '' and those belonging to the second particle , by `` 2 '' . in order to avoid unnecessary complication of our consideration , we assume the center of mass of the system to be at rest . if the motion of the system is uniform , one can readily come to the corresponding conclusions by introducing a moving coordinate frame .",
    "we shall look for the solution to the problem in the approximation used , for instance , in monograph @xcite , i.e. , in the nonrelativistic approximation .    there is a well known solution to this problem involving the reduced mass ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ,  13 or @xcite ,  12 ) . in this case ,",
    "analysis of the motion of two particles is replaced by consideration of the motion of one fictitious @xmath2-particle with a mass @xmath3 ( reduced mass ) , with this @xmath2-particle assumed to move in a centrally symmetric field with a center at rest placed at the center of mass of the two particles .",
    "the magnitude of this field is governed by the force of interaction of the two particles with one another .",
    "on finding the law by which the @xmath2-particle moves , one will be able to readily reconstruct the motion of the real particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one can offer the other kind of solution .",
    "this solution assumes each particle moves in its own stationary potential well and for each body separately the energy and the angular momentum laws are valid . said otherwise , in place of an analysis of the motion of one @xmath2-particle in a gravitational potential field associated with particle interaction one may consider the motion of each real particle in the stationary gravitational potential field created by the other particle .",
    "this stationary field differs , however from the gravitational field produced by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
    "our task is to fined this potential fields for every particle .",
    "potential energy of interaction of two point masses at rest which are on the distance @xmath4 from one another is    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath7 is the vector from particle `` 1 ''  to particle `` 2 ''  .",
    "this expression one can write in another form    @xmath8    here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gravitational potentials created by particles @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "respectively    @xmath11    coordinate @xmath12 is the distance between the particles .",
    "it is not convenient to use this coordinate when particles are moving .",
    "it is more convenient to use coordinate @xmath13 which one can reckon from the center of mass .",
    "taking it into account we write energies of the particles `` 1 ''  and `` 2 ''  , which are located at points @xmath14 and @xmath15 similar to formula ( [ 2 ] )    @xmath16    @xmath17    here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the potentials which we must find , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the coefficients connected this potentials with the gravitational potentials generated by the particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 :    @xmath22    this formulation suggests that we are describing not the energy of interaction of particles with one another but rather the potential energy of each particle separately , which is referenced to a certain level . as is common practice , we take for the zero level the energy of interaction of a particle @xmath23 with other particle at infinity .",
    "let us turn now to the above potentials .",
    "we shall use for this purpose the relations derived for the well known solution involving the reduced mass .",
    "we place the origin of coordinates at the center of mass of the system under consideration . in this case",
    "@xmath24    introduce a vector defining the relative positions of the particles    @xmath25    we have defined this vector by @xmath7 rather than by @xmath26 as this is done usually , in order not to confuse it with the running coordinate @xmath26 which we reckon from the origin .",
    "vector @xmath7 is the same vector which enter in the ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) formulas .",
    "the equalities ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) yield    @xmath27    differentiating eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] )  ( [ 8 ] ) with respect to time , we come to similar relations for the point velocities    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the velocities of the particles under consideration , and @xmath33 is the relative particle velocity .",
    "recall that it is the relative quantities @xmath7 and @xmath33 that are invoked in dealing with the problem with the use of reduced mass . and it is the coordinate @xmath7 that is employed to describe the trajectory of the @xmath2-particle .",
    "we can use now eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) to express the kinetic energy of each particle in terms of the relative velocity :    @xmath34    @xmath35    in eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) , the kinetic energy is expressed both through the velocities of individual particles and the relative velocity .",
    "an analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) suggests that the expressions for the energy written in terms of the velocities of individual particles and through the relative velocity differ in characteristic factors :    @xmath36    we are going now to express the potential energy of each particle through its coordinates ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) ) , whereas up to now the potential energy of interaction of two particles was defined in terms of a relative parameter , namely , separation distance between the particles @xmath37 ( see eq . ( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "this suggests that a transition from description of the energy through separation distance between the particles , a relative parameter , to that in terms of the energy of each particle separately should bring about the appearance of factors of the kind of eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , by the virial theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ,  10 , or @xcite ,  6 ) , for the coulomb potential well the kinetic energy is related to the potential energy through    @xmath38 where the line above denotes averaging over time .",
    "for circular motion , this relation is correct without averaging .",
    "thus , the potential energy is proportional to the kinetic energy .",
    "this all adds up to the following recasting of eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) :    @xmath39    @xmath40    we obtain    @xmath41    and potentials    @xmath42    @xmath43    both potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 form a stationary potential wells placed at the origin in which the real particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 move .",
    "each particle , however , moves in its `` own ''  potential well , i.e. , the particle @xmath0 moves in the potential well formed by the potential @xmath19 , and the particle @xmath1 , in the potential well created by the potential @xmath18 .    the potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 are naturally nothing more than conventional potentials . they have been introduced by convention to describe the motion of the real particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the time has come now to check whether the expressions for the potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 are correct .",
    "how can one verify the correctness of these relations ?",
    "first , the sum of the potential energies of both particles should be equal to the potential energy ( [ 1 ] ) of interaction of the both particles with one another .",
    "summing eqs .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , we see clearly that this equality is upheld for all @xmath14 and @xmath15 at any moment of time .",
    "because each particle moves in its fixed potential well , the laws of conservation of energy and momentum should be met for each particle separately .",
    "let us check it .",
    "we use eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) to find the ratio of the kinetic energies of the two particles    @xmath44    whence    @xmath45    next we take eqs .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) , and ( [ 8 ] ) to find the ratio of the potential energies of the two particles    @xmath46    whence    @xmath47    summing eqs .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) term by term , we come to the total energies @xmath48 and @xmath49 of each particle    @xmath50    or , in a more concise form    @xmath51    thus , we see that the ratio of the total energies of each particle obeys the equality similar to the relations ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] )    @xmath52    the sum of the total energies of each particle should yield the total energy of the whole system . using equalities ( [ 25 ] )",
    "we come to    @xmath53    @xmath54    the total @xmath55 is conserved as the energy of a closed system . hence , as follows from equalities ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , the total energies of each of the particles are conserved , i.e. , are coordinate independent    @xmath56    thus , each particle moves in its potential well with its own energy .",
    "consider now the angular momentum of the system and of the particles separately .",
    "we express the angular momentum of particles through the coordinates @xmath57 and the relative velocity @xmath58 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , we write the angular momenta of the particles as follows    @xmath59= m_1\\frac{m_2 ^ 2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}[\\mathbf{l}\\times\\mathbf{v}],\\ ] ]    @xmath60= m_2\\frac{m_1 ^ 2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}[\\mathbf{l}\\times\\mathbf{v}].\\ ] ]    as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) , the vectors @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] are oriented in the same direction . from the ratio of the momenta",
    "@xmath64    we immediately obtain    @xmath65    the sum of the momenta of the two particles should give the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "we sum the momenta to obtain    @xmath66    @xmath67    the total angular momentum @xmath68 , as the momentum of a closed system , is conserved .",
    "but then , as seen from the equalities ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) , the momenta of each of the particles are conserved , i.e. , they are coordinate independent :    @xmath69    because for each particle both the total energy and the angular momentum are conserved , one may consider the motion of each particle in its potential well separately , and calculate the energies and angular momenta also separately for each particle .",
    "also , there is no need to use the reduced mass ; indeed , one may use instead real masses of each particle .",
    "relation of energies of the particles must obey eqs .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) , ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , and relation of angular momenta  eqs .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) , ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "if , however , one has to know the positions of particles with respect to one another , one will have to consult eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "we note in conclusion that this approach permits one to separate completely not only the kinetic but the potential energies as well . indeed , instead of expressing the potential energy through the relative coordinate @xmath7 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) , it can be defined in terms of the coordinates of each particle separately @xmath70",
    "because in each potential well particles move saving its energies and angular momenta one can study the behavior of particles with the use of the well known relations describing the motion of one particle in a potential well ( see , e.g. , @xcite ,  15 ) . as follows from these relations ,",
    "if the potential energy in a central field is inversely proportional to @xmath71 ( @xmath71 is the radial coordinate ) , i.e. , it can be written as ( showing explicitly the sign )                here @xmath55 is the total energy of the particle , and @xmath81 is the squared angular momentum .",
    "if it is necessary to find the trajectory of the particle one must know quantities @xmath55 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is known that the same relations can be used if one analyzes the relative motion of two particles . in this case",
    ", one has to put for mass @xmath23 in these relations the reduced mass @xmath82 .",
    "a fictitious particle with mass @xmath2 describes the motion of a system of two particles .",
    "we are going in what follows to label all quantities related to the fictitious particle @xmath2 by index @xmath2 .",
    "let us see how the trajectories of each particle are related to that of the fictitious particle @xmath2 describing the behavior of a system of two particles . and also , whether it is possible to trace the possible trajectories of each particle without resorting to the intermediate @xmath2 particle .    if the axis from which the angle @xmath74 is reckoned passes through the point of the ellipse closest to the focus ( the perihelion ) , the constant of integration @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) is zero , and if this point is farthest from the focus of the ellipse , @xmath83 ( with either of the signs ) .",
    "the perihelia of the orbits of particles `` 1 ''  and `` 2 ''  look , however , in opposite directions .",
    "this is seen clearly already from equality ( [ 6 ] ) ; indeed , for this equality to hold , vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 must reach the maximum and the minimum simultaneously .",
    "the orbits of the particles are shown in fig .  1 .        in fig .  1",
    ", the center of mass of the system is at point @xmath86 ( the origin ) .",
    "also shown are the orbits of particles `` 1''and `` 2 ''  , vector @xmath87 and the @xmath2 orbit ( dashed ) along which the fictitious particle with mass @xmath2 moves . as seen from fig .  1 , the constant @xmath76 for the ellipse `` 1 ''  should be equal to @xmath88 , and for the ellipse `` 2 ''  , @xmath89 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) , and ( [ 42 ] ) , one can readily verify that @xmath92 , i.e. , the eccentricities for both particles are equal .",
    "this implies that the shape of the trajectory ( shape of the ellipse ) is the same for the two particles . as for the @xmath77 parameters , i.e. , the dimensions of the ellipses , these parameters obey the relation          express vector @xmath57 from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) through the ellipse parameters ( the coordinate @xmath57 describes the trajectory of the @xmath2 particle ) .",
    "we can use the general relation ( [ 38 ] ) to express @xmath84 and @xmath85 through the parameters of the ellipses . because vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 are antiparallel , in polar coordinates",
    "the vectors will differ by @xmath95 .",
    "for the coordinate @xmath71 of the trajectory of the @xmath2 particle we have latexmath:[$r=|\\mathbf l|=    coordinate of vector @xmath85 is @xmath97 , because it is for the `` 2 ''  ellipse that the constant @xmath89 . for the vector @xmath84 , the angular coordinate @xmath98 .",
    "apart from this , as already mentioned , for the ellipse `` 1 ''  the constant @xmath88 . using eqs .",
    "( [ 44 ] ) and recalling that the directions of the vectors differ by @xmath95 , we come to            express the parameters of the ellipse @xmath2 in terms of those of ellipses `` 1 ''  and `` 2 ''",
    ". the angular momentum of the system should be the sum of momenta of the particles and equal to the momentum of the @xmath2-particle , because it is the latter that describes the behavior of the system :        recasting expression ( [ 39 ] ) to the form @xmath106 , we substitute in expression ( [ 47 ] ) @xmath107 from relation ( [ 46 ] ) , and @xmath108 from relation ( [ 41 ] ) , and take into account that for system of two particles @xmath109 .",
    "the end result is      thus we have once again come to the well known result , namely , if we express the parameters of the ellipse along which the @xmath2-point moves through the parameters of motion of real particles , then for the mass we should take @xmath82 , i.e. , the reduced mass .    summing up",
    ", we have shown that in the `` two - body problem ''  one can operate without using the concept of the reduced mass . in this case , however , one should use not the energy of particle interaction ( [ 37 ] ) but rather the energy of each particle , which is reckoned from the zero level :              it might seem at first glance that this complicates solution of the problem .",
    "this approach permits one , however , to separate the potential energies and consider separately the motion of each particle in its potential well .",
    "we note in conclusion that using the standard approach with the reduced mass requires a two - step procedure , in which one first finds the solution for the reduced mass , and after that , derive from this solution the parameters of motion of the particles of interest .",
    "application of the above technique permits one to calculate _ * directly * _ the possible trajectories of _ * each * _ particle .",
    "such approach one can use in the case when particles have electric charges @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( in the case under consideration charges must have opposite signs ) .",
    "such approach can be used only if velocities of the charges @xmath117 ( @xmath76 is the light velocity ) . in this case",
    "we can neglect by the energy of the magnetic field which appears in moving charged particles in comparison with the energy of the electric field .",
    "said otherwise , in this case we neglect by the vector potential @xmath118 and claim that particles move in scalar potential @xmath119 only .",
