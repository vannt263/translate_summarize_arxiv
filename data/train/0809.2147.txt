    "ognitive radio ( cr ) is a promising technology for efficient spectrum utilization in the future wireless communication systems .",
    "the main design objective for a cr network is to maximize its throughput while providing sufficient protection to the existing primary radio ( pr ) network .",
    "there are two basic operation models for crs : _ opportunistic spectrum access _",
    "( osa ) , where the cr is allowed to transmit over a frequency band only when all the pr transmissions are off , and _ spectrum sharing _ ( ss ) , where the cr can transmit concurrently with prs , provided that it knows how to control the resultant interference powers at prs below a tolerable threshold @xcite . on the other hand , `` multiuser diversity ( md ) '' @xcite , as a fundamental property of wireless networks , has been widely applied for opportunistic communications in wireless systems .",
    "the conventional form of md is usually exploited in a wireless system with multiple independent - fading communication links by selecting one link with the best instantaneous channel condition to transmit at one time , also known as _ dynamic time - division multiple - access _ ( d - tdma ) .    in this letter",
    ", we consider ss - based fading cr networks and investigate for them a new form of md , named _",
    "multiuser interference diversity _ ( mid ) , which is due to the cr and pr mutual interference and thus different from the conventional md .",
    "more specifically , `` transmit mid ( t - mid ) '' is due to the fact that the maximum transmit powers of different cr transmitters vary with their independent - fading channels to a pr receiver under a given interference power constraint , while `` receive mid ( r - mid ) '' is due to the fact that the pr interference powers at different cr receivers vary with their independent - fading channels from a pr transmitter .",
    "this letter studies the mid for various types of cr networks with d - tdma , including the multiple - access channel ( mac ) , broadcast channel ( bc ) , and parallel - access channel ( pac ) , and analyzes the achievable _ multiuser diversity gain _ ( mdg ) as a function of the number of crs , @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that due to the newly discovered mid , the mdg ( as defined in this letter ) for each cr network under consideration is no smaller than that in the conventional network without the pr link , which holds for arbitrary fading channel distributions and values of @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", it is also shown that the mid results in the same asymptotic growth order over @xmath0 for the cr network ergodic throughput as that due to the md for the conventional network , as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "it is noted that md for the fading cr networks has been recently studied in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "md was analyzed for the fading cr mac with a given @xmath0 at the asymptotic regime where the ratio between the cr transmit power constraint and interference power constraint goes to infinity . in @xcite ,",
    "md was investigated for the fading cr pac with the constant cr transmit power at the asymptotic region with @xmath1 . in this letter",
    ", we study md for different types of cr networks with arbitrary cr transmit and interference power constraints , and arbitrary number of cr users .",
    "consider a ss - based cr network coexisting with a pr network .",
    "for the propose of exposition , only one active pr link consisting of a pr transmitter ( pr - tx ) and a pr receiver ( pr - rx ) is considered .",
    "all terminals in the network are assumed to be each equipped with a single antenna .",
    "we consider the _ block - fading _ ( bf ) model for all the channels involved and coherent communications ; thus , only the fading channel power gains ( amplitude squares ) are of interest . it is assumed that the additive noises at all pr and cr receive terminals are independent circular symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variables each having zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we consider three types of cr networks described as follows .",
    "* _ cognitive mac ( c - mac ) _ , where @xmath0 crs , denoted by cr@xmath2 , cr@xmath3 , cr@xmath4 , transmit independent messages to a cr base station ( cr - bs ) .",
    "denote @xmath5 as the power gain of the fading channel from cr@xmath6 to cr - bs , @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , @xmath8 is defined for the fading channel from cr@xmath6 to pr - rx , @xmath9 is for that from pr - tx to pr - rx , and @xmath10 is for that from pr - tx to cr - bs . * _ cognitive bc ( c - bc ) _ , where cr - bs sends independent messages to @xmath0 crs .",
    "channel reciprocity is assumed between the c - mac and c - bc ; thus , the fading channel power gain from cr - bs to cr@xmath6 in the c - bc is the same as @xmath5 in the c - mac .",
    "in addition , @xmath11 is defined as the fading channel power gain from cr - bs to pr - rx , and @xmath12 is defined for the channel from pr - tx to cr@xmath6 . * _ cognitive pac ( c - pac ) _ , where @xmath0 distributed cr transmitters , denoted by cr - tx@xmath2 , @xmath13 , cr - tx@xmath4 , transmit independent messages to the corresponding receivers , denoted by cr - rx@xmath2 , @xmath13 , cr - rx@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "similarly like the c - mac and c - bc , we denote @xmath5 as the power gain of the fading channel from cr - tx@xmath6 to cr - rx@xmath6 , @xmath7 ; @xmath8 and @xmath12 are defined for the fading channels from cr - tx@xmath6 to pr - rx and from pr - tx to cr - rx@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath14 be the _ peak _ ( with respect to fading states ) transmit power constraint at cr - bs in the c - bc , and @xmath15 be that at cr@xmath6 in the c - mac or at cr - tx@xmath6 in the c - pac .",
    "it is assumed that pr - tx transmits with a constant power @xmath16 ; and each cr transmit terminal protects the pr by applying the _ peak _ interference power constraint at pr - rx , denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the transmit power for cr @xmath19 in the c - mac or c - pac , and @xmath20 be that for cr - bs in the c - bc .",
    "let @xmath21 be one realization of @xmath8 for a particular fading state ( similar notations apply for the other channels ) .",
    "combining both the transmit and interference power constraints , we obtain @xmath22 the maximum achievable receiver signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of cr @xmath19 can then be expressed as @xmath23 for the c - mac , c - bc , and c - pac , respectively .",
    "note that the noise at each cr receive terminal includes both the additive gaussian noise and the interference from pr - tx .",
    "we are then interested in maximizing the long - term system throughput in each cr network by adopting the following d - tdma rule : at one particular fading state , cr @xmath19 is selected for transmission if it has the largest achievable receiver snr among all the crs .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the selected user at this fading state .",
    "from ( [ eq : power ] ) and ( [ eq : snr ] ) , it then follows that @xmath25 for the c - mac , c - bc , and c - pac , respectively . by substituting @xmath24 for each cr network into ( [ eq : snr ] )",
    ", the corresponding maximum receiver snr over cr users is obtained as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 , each as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we study the md for different cr networks under a set of `` symmetric '' assumptions , where all @xmath5 s are assumed to have the same distribution , so are @xmath8 s and @xmath12 s ; and @xmath29 .",
    "we then define @xmath30/\\mathbb{e}[\\gamma_{\\rm mac}(1)]$ ] as the _ mdg _ for the c - mac ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are similarly defined for the c - bc and c - pac , respectively . from ( [ eq : optimal k mac ] ) , ( [ eq : optimal k bc ] ) , and ( [ eq : optimal k pac ] ) , it follows that @xmath33 \\label{eq : md gain mac}\\\\ \\bar{\\gamma}_{\\rm bc}(k)&=\\kappa_{\\rm bc}\\mathbb{e}[\\max_k h_k/(1+qe_k ) ] \\label{eq : md gain bc }",

    "\\kappa_{\\rm pac}&=1/(\\mathbb{e}[h_k]\\mathbb{e}[\\min(p,\\gamma / g_k)]\\mathbb{e}[1/(1+qe_k ) ] ) \\label{eq : kappa pac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are constants , which can be shown independent of @xmath19 due to the symmetric assumptions . in order to fairly compare the mdg in each cr network with that in the conventional network",
    ", we introduce a _ reference _ network by removing the pr link in each cr network . for such reference networks , since there is no interference power constraint nor interference from pr - tx to cr terminals , it is easy to show that cr @xmath19 with the largest @xmath35 among all the crs should be scheduled for transmission at each fading state due to d - tdma .",
    "thus , we define the mdg of the reference network as @xmath36\\ ] ] where @xmath37 $ ] is a constant , which is independent of @xmath19 .    from ( [ eq : md gain mac])-([eq : md gain ] ) , it follows that the mdgs for different cr networks all differ from the conventional mdg for the reference network .",
    "we highlight their differences as follows .",
    "* for the c - mac , it is observed from ( [ eq : md gain mac ] ) that the mdg is obtained by taking the maximum product between @xmath35 and @xmath38 over all @xmath19 s , where the former also exists in the conventional mdg given in ( [ eq : md gain ] ) , while the latter is a new term due to independent @xmath21 s over which cr transmitters interfere with pr - rx , thus named _",
    "t - mid_. * for the c - bc , it is observed from ( [ eq : md gain bc ] ) that the mdg is obtained by taking the maximum product between @xmath35 and @xmath39 over crs , where the former term contributes to the conventional mdg , while the latter term is a new source of diversity due to independent @xmath40 s over which pr - tx interferes with cr receivers , thus named _",
    "r - mid_. * for the c - pac , it follows from ( [ eq : md gain pac ] ) that in addition to the conventional md , there are _ combined _ t - mid and r - mid .",
    "next , we show the following theorem , which says that the mdg of each cr network for a given @xmath0 is lower - bounded by that of the reference network , @xmath41 ; and is upper - bounded by a constant ( greater than one ) multiplication of @xmath41 .    [",

    "we only show the proof for the c - pac case , while similar proofs can be obtained for the c - mac and c - bc and are thus omitted here .",
    "first , we consider the lower bound on @xmath32 . by denoting @xmath48 as the user with the largest @xmath35 among all the crs",
