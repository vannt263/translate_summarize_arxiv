    "two recent papers by fewster and roman @xcite discuss a variety of problems arising from wormholes using arbitrarily small amounts of exotic matter , including wormhole models by visser @xcite and kuhfittig @xcite .",
    "it was found that two of the kuhfittig models are seriously flawed by not taking into account the proper distances in estimating the size of certain wormholes .",
    "a corrected version of these models resulted in a wormhole that turned out to be traversable but contained an exotic region whose proper thickness was much larger than desired for wormhole construction @xcite .",
    "some of the other models discussed in @xcite need to be incredibly fine - tuned , even for small throat sizes .    the purpose of this paper is to propose a reasonable balance between reducing the proper thickness of the exotic region ( the region in which the weak energy condition is violated ) and the amount of fine - tuning required to achieve this reduction .",
    "there are no particular restrictions on the throat size .",
    "various constraints are shown to be met , so that the resulting wormhole is traversable for humanoid travelers .",
    "our starting point is the line element @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the redshift function , which must be everywhere finite .",
    "our units are taken to be those in which @xmath2 .",
    "the function @xmath3 has a vertical asymptote at the throat @xmath4 : @xmath5 if @xmath6 [ morris and thorne ( mt ) @xcite ] , then the  shape function \" @xmath7 can be written @xmath8 in the absence of any other conditions the proper radial distance @xmath9 to the throat from any point outside , given by @xmath10 may diverge as @xmath11 .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is to start with the function @xmath12 in the vicinity of the throat ; @xmath13 is a constant having the same units as @xmath14 and will be determined later . since",
    "this function eventually becomes negative , it will have to be joined smoothly to some @xmath15 which goes to zero as @xmath16 .",
    "( this construction will be made explicit below . )",
    "now observe that for @xmath17 @xmath18 which is finite for @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , @xmath20 . the redshift function is assumed to have a similar form in the vicinity of the throat : @xmath21 where @xmath22 to avoid an event horizon at the throat .",
    "this function is also subject to modification .",
    "next , recall that the weak energy condition ( wec ) requires the mass - energy tensor @xmath23 to obey @xmath24 for all time - like vectors and , by continuity , all null vectors .",

    "choose @xmath29 and construct @xmath3 and @xmath30 so that @xmath31 it will be shown presently that , if @xmath32 then @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath37 for @xmath34 ; if @xmath36 , the sense of the inequality is reversed . to see this ,",
    "observe that equality holds for @xmath38 .",
    "now multiply both sides by @xmath39 and denote the resulting left side by @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 since @xmath42 , @xmath40 is strictly increasing , enough to establish the inequalities .",
    "as noted earlier , @xmath43 and @xmath44 will eventually become negative . anticipating this",
    ", we can cut these functions off at some @xmath45 and then connect them smoothly to suitable new functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "( for physical reasons @xmath48 should be larger than @xmath29 . )",
    "suppose @xmath46 has the following form : @xmath49 then @xmath50 since we want @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 it follows that @xmath53 and @xmath54 similarly , @xmath55 besides having slopes of equal absolute value at @xmath48 , we want the functions to meet , i.e. , we want @xmath56 to this end we must determine @xmath13 and @xmath57 .",
    "for the first case , @xmath58 thus @xmath59 . in a similar manner , @xmath60 .",
    "returning to @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath38 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 were chosen so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 would have the desired properties .",
    "for @xmath63 the form of @xmath44 can safely be altered : retain the value of the function as well as the slope at @xmath38 but for @xmath63 continue @xmath44 as a straight line with slope @xmath64 or , better still , as a curve that is approximately linear .",
    "( in particular , @xmath44 need not have an asymptote close to @xmath4 . ) as a result , @xmath65 is relatively small , while @xmath66 on @xmath28 $ ] , as before .",
    "the purpose of this change is two - fold : to avoid a large time - dilation near the throat ( discussed at the end of section [ s : other ] ) and to address the issue raised in ref .",
    "@xcite : as long as the asymptote is retained at @xmath67 , the proper distance across the exotic region is shown to be quite large .",

    "( [ e : ab ] ) , we get @xmath93 assuming now that the constraint is just met .    taking the square root of the reciprocals , we get @xmath94 or @xmath95 returning to eq .",
    "( [ e : proper1 ] ) , @xmath96 ( see fig .  1 ;",
    "the graph is plotted using @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . )",
    "in particular , @xmath100    even though @xmath101 as @xmath102 , considerable fine - tuning is required , as can be seen from fig",
    ".  2 ( plotted using @xmath97 ) : @xmath103 rises so rapidly that even a small increase in @xmath62 can result in a large increase in @xmath103 .",

    ", @xmath62 is plotted against log(@xmath107 ) for four values of @xmath108 ( right to left ) : 5 m , 50 m , 500 m , and 5000 m. observe that the exponent @xmath62 remains very close to 1/2 for any reasonable value of @xmath107 and is virtually independent of @xmath108 .",
    "now consider the following coordinate distances : @xmath109 m and @xmath110 m. then @xmath111 for the proper distance @xmath103 we get @xmath112 since eq .",
    "( [ e : lateral3 ] ) is really an inequality , the result is , stricly speaking , @xmath113 cm .",
    "however , the proper distance can also be obtained by direct integration , using the same values for @xmath13 and @xmath61 : @xmath114    _ remark : _ if @xmath44 is modified for @xmath63 , as described in section [ s : mod ] , then the constraint , eq .",
    "( [ e : radial2 ] ) , is met _ a fortiori : _ since @xmath115 for any @xmath63 , @xmath116 ^ 2\\right)\\ ] ] is less than the value of @xmath88 at @xmath38 .",
    "while the distances chosen are rather arbitrary , the outcome , a proper distance of 1 cm , seems promising .",
    "it is also clear that reducing this distance any further would require even more fine - tuning . on the positive side , without any special restriction on @xmath81 ,",
    "the wormhole can be macroscopic .",
    "it remains to check some of the other constraints in mt @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the redshift function must satisfy the condition @xmath117 at the stations @xcite . if @xmath89 , the distance to the stations , is chosen to be 225000 km and if @xmath118 km , then ( since @xmath119 ) @xmath120 also , the stations should be far enough away from the throat so that @xmath121 , making the space nearly flat .",
    "a similar formulation is that @xmath122 is close to unity .",
    "this constraint is easily met given that @xmath123 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ e : lateral1 ] ) and ( [ e : lateral2 ] ) , the remaining tidal constraints can be written @xcite @xmath124 ( here @xmath125 $ ] . )",
    "the first term is close to zero near the throat while the second is merely a constraint on the velocity of the traveler .",
    "a final consideration is the time dilation near the throat .",
    "let @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 ( assuming that @xmath128 . ) since @xmath129 and @xmath130 , we have for any coordinate interval @xmath131 : @xmath132 since we are concerned mainly with the vicinity of the throat , let us consider the interval @xmath133 $ ] . if the form of @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ e : redshift1 ] ) were retained , the result would be @xmath134 since both @xmath61 and @xmath62 exceed 1/2 , @xmath135 as @xmath136 approaches @xmath81 .",
    "it was noted in section  [ s : mod ] , however , that to the left of @xmath29 , @xmath82 is  straightened out , \" that is , @xmath82 no longer has an asymptote close to @xmath67 . as a result , letting @xmath97 again , @xmath137 which is now finite .",
    "in addition to the proper velocity @xmath138 , the time interval @xmath131 evidently depends on @xmath82 , as well as the choice of @xmath13 .",
    "but since we are dealing with a relatively small distance and hence a small proper traversal time , the time dilation is of little significance .",
    "this conclusion also holds for @xmath139 since @xmath140 and @xmath141 fall off so rapidly .",
    "this paper discusses a wormhole model with the following characteristics : since the derivative of the shape function is unity at the throat , the quantum inequalities are trivially satisfied . in place of this requirement one is faced with a restriction on the spacetime geometry that may be equally severe .",
    "the severity of this restriction notwithstanding , the model allows a compromise between shrinking the exotic region and fine - tuning the metric coefficients : reducing the amount of exotic matter can only be accomplished by further fine - tuning .",
    "there is no way to determine _ a priori _ which requirement is easier to meet , or whether , being interdependent , either one can be met .",
    "one can only hope that in the end this problem reduces to an engineering challenge .",
    "no particular restriction is placed on the throat size . moreover ,",
    "various traversability criteria are met , resulting in a wormhole that is traversable for humanoid travelers .",
