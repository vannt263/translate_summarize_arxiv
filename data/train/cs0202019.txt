    "the gnutella network is a class of open source  @xcite virtual networks known as _ peer - to - peer _ or p2p networks . compared to the more ubiquitous client - server distributed architectures , every p2p node ( or _ servant _ ) can act as both a client and a server .",
    "many client - server applications e.g. , commercial databases , have multiple clients ( users ) accessing a centralized server ( see e.g. ,  @xcite chap . 8) . conversely , p2p network applications are usually completely decentralized .",
    "finding applications that can make efficient use of p2p is the current gating factor for their widespread adoption .",
    "so far , p2p networks have been employed for such applications as the napster ( ` www.napster.com ` ) music file - sharing service , and the seti@home project ( ` setiathome.ssl ` ` .berkeley.edu ` ) , although those implementations rely on a significant centralized server component .",
    "the initial release of gnutella in 2000 led to the perception that the intrinsic architecture may not be capable of scaling to meet the sharing demands of millions of anticipated users .",
    "similar concerns about scalability have arisen in the context of hypergrowth traffic impinging on popular e - commerce web sites  @xcite . based on measurements of popular queries",
    ",  @xcite proposed that gnutella scaling problems could be ameliorated through the implementation of appropriate caching strategies .",
    "measurements by @xcite indicated that there were more readers than writers involved in file sharing .",
    "they suggested that such a `` free ride '' could lead to higher than expected load on the p2p network thereby degrading its performance as well as increasing its vulnerability to fragmentation .    a mathematical analysis by  @xcite ( one of the original developers of napster ) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that the gnutella network could not scale to the capacity of the competitor napster network .",
    "essentially , that model showed that the gnutella network is severely bandwidth limited long before the p2p population reaches a million peers . in each of these previous studies ,",
    "the conclusions have overlooked the intrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology  @xcite in the gnutella network : a cayley tree  @xcite .",
    "( see section  [ sec : trees ] for the definition )    trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher dimensional topologies e.g. , hypercubes and hypertori .",
    "studies of interconnection topologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware implementations ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) which are generally limited by the cost of the chips and wires to a few thousand nodes  @xcite .",
    "p2p networks , on the other hand , are intended to support hundreds of thousands to millions of simultaneous peers and since they are implemented in software , hyper - topologies are relatively unfettered by the economics hardware .    in this paper , we analyze the scalability of several alternative topologies and compare their throughput up to 2 - 3 million peers .",
    "the virtual hypercube and the virtual hypertorus offer near - linear scalable bandwidth subject to the number of peer tcp / ip connections that can be simultaneously kept open .",
    "we adopt the abbreviation _",
    "hypernet _ for these alternative topologies .",
    "the assumptions about the distribution of peer activity are similar to those employed by  @xcite .",
    "this is appropriate since our purpose is to rank the relative performance of these hypernets rather than to predict their absolute performance .",
    "in the subsequent discussion , the p2p network is treated as a graph i.e. , a set nodes or vertices connected by a set of edges or links .",
    "the nodes correspond to network peers and the links to the links to network connections .",
    "because the tree structure of the gnutella network has been such a hidden determinant underlying the conclusions drawn in previous scalability studies , we commence our performance comparisons by distinguishing clearly among the relevant tree topologies .",
    "topologically , all trees are planar and thus have d = 2 spatial dimensionality .      the binary tree is familiar in the computing context by virtue of its ubiquity as a parsing and storage data structure  @xcite .",
    "there is a unique root node which is connected only to two sibling nodes and each of those siblings is connected to another pair of sibling nodes and so on . at each level ( h ) in the tree",
    ", there are @xmath0 nodes .",
    "therefore , the number of nodes grows as a binary exponential . because of its relatively sparse nodal density ,",
    "the binary tree is rarely employed as a bona fide interconnection network .",
    "a rooted tree is simply the generalization of a binary tree in which each node ( other than the root ) has a vertex of degree v. the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series : @xmath1      a cayley tree  @xcite has no root . recalling the binary tree , what was the root of the parent binary tree now has a link to an another binary sub - tree of height one less than the parent .",
    "all nodes thus become tri - valent with v = 3 at every level . more generally , for a v - valent tree , the total number of nodes is given by : @xmath2 and therefore is denser than (  [ eqn : bin ] ) .",
    "this is the central formula used in the scalability analysis of  @xcite .",
    "the network he analyzed is thus a cayley tree with vertex degree ( v ) corresponding to the number of open network connections per servant . @xcite",
    "analyzed valences in the range @xmath3 ; the former value being the default setting in the original gnutella release , and the latter more closely resembling the number of peers claimed for the contemporaneous napster network .",
    "an alternative to bandwidth - limited trees is a topology with higher dimensionality .",
    "we examine the performance attributes of two hypernets in particular : the binary hypercube and the hypertorus , each in d - dimensions .      in a boolean or binary hypercube",
    "each node forms the vertex of a d - dimensional cube  @xcite .",
    "the number of nodes is simply @xmath4 and the degree of each vertex ( v ) is equal to the dimensionality ( d ) of the network .",
    "hence , each node can be enumerated or addressed using a base-2 ( binary ) d - digit number .    moreover , since neighboring nodes differ in address by only 1 digit , sending a message on the hypercube becomes a simple matter of shifting successive bits as the binary address passes each node between source and destination .    in d = 3 dimensions",
    "the hypercube is simply a cube .",
    "each vertex has degree v = 3 , so there are @xmath5 nodes .",
    "a 4-dimensional hypercube , can be visualized as spatially translating a 3-cube such that the locus of its 4 vertices trace out the additional connections .",
    "a d - dimensional hypertorus  @xcite is a d - dimensional grid with each nodes connected to a ring of nodes in each of the d orthogonal dimensions .",
    "the hypertorus reduces to the binary hypercube when there are only 2 nodes in each ring .",
    "the simplest visualization is , once again , in 3-dimensions .",
    "a 2-dimensional grid is first wrapped about one axis such the edges join to form a tube . the tube is wrapped about the orthogonal axis to form a ring such that the open ends of the tube become joined . the result is a 3-torus , otherwise known as a donut .",
    "all of these topologies fall into a class known as single stage networks and are relatively easy to implement in software .",
    "the more exotic topologies , such as cube - connected cycles , butterflies and other multistage  @xcite networks are not considered here because they are likely to be more difficult to implement .",
    "the notion of a network diameter is analogous to the diameter for a circle .",
    "there , it is the maximum chordal length between two points on the circumference . for a network ,",
    "it is the maximum number of communication links that must be traversed to send a message to any node along the shortest path .",
    "it represents a lower bound on the latency to propagate messages throughout the entire network .",
    ".network diameters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the 20-dimensional hypercube outranks all other contenders on the basis of query throughput . for an horizon containing 2 million peers , each servant must maintain 20 open connections , on average .",
    "this is well within the capacity limits of most tcp / ip implementations  @xcite .",
    "the 10-dimensional hypertorus is comparable to the 20-hypercube in bandwidth up to an horizon of 1 million peers but falls off by almost 10% at 2 million peers .",
    "the 10-torus is also arguably a more difficult topology to implement .",
    "the 20-valent cayley tree is included since the number of connections per peer is the same as that for the 20-cube and the 10-torus .",
    "an horizon of 6 hops was used for comparison because the peer population is only 144,801 nodes at 5 hops . similarly for 8-cayley , a 9 hop horizon would contain 7.7 million peers .",
    "these large increments are a direct consequence of the high vertex degree per node .",
    "the 4-cayley ( modeling early gnutella ) and 8-cayley ( modeling the napster population ) show relatively poor scalability at 1 million peers .",
    "even doubling the number of connections per peer produces slightly better than 50% improvement in throughput .",
    "this confirms the conclusions reached in  @xcite and , moreover , supports our proposal to consider hypernet topologies .",
    "previous studies of gnutella scalability have tended to overlook the intrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying tree topology .",
    "the most thorough and accurate of these studies is that presented in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , his analysis could be accused of straining at a gnat . as a viable candidate for massively scalable bandwidth",
    ", our analysis demonstrates that trees are dead .",
    "conversely , by going to higher dimensional virtual networks ( and the hypercube in particular ) near linear scalability can be achieved for populations on the order of several million peers each with only 20 open connections . according to section [ sec : metrics ] ,",
    "this level of scalability would already match the number of nodes present in the entire web .",
    "the dominant constraint for hardware implementations of high - dimensional networks is the cost of the physical wires on the interconnect backplane .",
    "since the hypernets discussed here would be implemented in software , no such constraints would prevent reaching the desired level of scalability . in this sense , we see hypernets as offering good ( g)news for gnutella scalability .",
