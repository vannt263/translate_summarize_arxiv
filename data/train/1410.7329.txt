    "dynamical scaling relations of early - type ( elliptical e and lenticular s0 ) galaxies ( etgs ) relate the size , luminosity ( @xmath2 ) and stellar kinematics of galaxies .",
    "sizes are typically described by the half - light radius ( ) , while kinematics is generally quantified by the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ) within a given aperture , which in this review i assume no larger than .",
    "given that luminosity and size depend on distance , while kinematics do not , one of the first key applications of galaxy scaling relations was to infer galaxy distances @xcite .    in more recent times ,",
    "more accurate distance determination techniques have been developed , mostly based on characteristics of the galaxy stellar population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover we have a deeper understanding of the relation between redshift and distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these reasons",
    "distance determination is not any more the main use of dynamical scaling relations .    instead",
    ", dynamical scaling relations are nowadays a key tool to study galaxy formation .",
    "the main reasons for this is : ( i ) because they provide a statistical description for easily measurable characteristics of galaxies as a function of time ( redshift ) , which can be directly compared with numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( ii ) due to the fact that scaling parameters are actually expected to evolve very differently depending on the galaxy formation mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this review i focus on what one can learn about dynamical scaling relations using dynamical models .",
    "some of the results i describe are closely linked to findings made using strong lensing or stellar population synthesis approaches .",
    "these were reviewed separately at this symposium , in particular by tommaso treu and charlie conroy , and are just briefly mentioned here .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a combined review of all these different mass determination techniques .",
    "the first dynamical scaling relation to be discovered was the one between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xcite , top - left in fig .",
    "[ fig : classics ] ) .",
    "the observed relation had the form @xmath4 and the authors pointed out it also suggests a trend between the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0 ) and galaxy luminosity .",
    "soon thereafter , a correlation between galaxy surface brightness @xmath5 and galaxy size was also found ( @xcite , top - right in fig .",
    "[ fig : classics ] ) . when one defines the surface brightness as the mean value within , then @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the kormendy relation describes a correlation between galaxy radius and luminosity .",
    "this form has the advantage that it does not explicitly include galaxy size on both axes of the correlation .",
    "the @xmath7 relation has recently become quite popular to study galaxy evolution as a function of redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , given that it does not involve any kinematic determination and for this reason is much more `` economical '' to observe than the faber - jackson .    thanks to larger systematic surveys of etgs it was later discovered that the faber - jackson and the kormendy relations are just two special projections of a plane described by galaxies in @xmath8 coordinates @xcite .",
    "this plane was aptly named the fundamental plane ( fp ) .",
    "it was found to hold for all etgs , including s0s and e galaxies , with a scatter smaller than 20% in  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of the fp was interpreted as due to the fact that galaxies satisfy virial equilibrium @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "however the exponents of the fp were found to deviate significantly from the virial predictions , a result confirmed by all numerous subsequent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , a recent determination of the plane , for the atlas@xmath11  volume - limited survey @xcite , with @xmath12 measured from integral - field stellar kinematics within , gives @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "12 in @xcite ) .",
    "this deviation of the fp from the virial predictions is called the `` tilt '' of the fp .",
    "the original fp discovery papers suggested the variation in the stellar @xmath0 as a likely explanation for the tilt . in a brilliant proceedings paper ,",
    "the seven samurai team went as far as stating that `` two - dimensionality implies that the virial theorem is the only tight constrain on e structure .",
    "( ... ) implies @xmath14 .",
    "core and global @xmath15 agree well , implying that ellipticals are mainly baryon dominated within  and that @xmath15 are stellar '' @xcite .",
    "as i will describe in what follows , it took a few decades for all these early insights to be convincingly confirmed .",
    "the variation of the @xmath0 of the stellar population was immediately recognized as a potential source for the tilt of the fp .",
    "this is because systematic changes in the galaxy population were already known , with galaxies becoming older and more metal rich with increasing mass or @xmath3 ( e.g. @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt_candidates ] top - left ) .",
    "this variation can potentially explain a major part of the fp tilt and scatter , predicting larger @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 by a factor of a few , as observed ( depending on the photometric band ) over the full range of galaxy masses @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of etgs also display systematic variations as a function of their luminosity .",
    "the profiles become more concentrated , or have larger @xcite indices , for increasing galaxy luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bottom - left in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt_candidates ] ) . at fixed mass",
    ", a steeper profile implies a larger @xmath3 within the central regions @xcite where the kinematics is observed ( typically within a fraction of ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath3 variation is again in principle sufficient to explain a major part of the fp tilt @xcite .",
    "a third potential cause for the fp tilt is the fraction of dark matter within the region where kinematics is observed .",
    "the dark matter fraction is expected to increase systematically with mass , for the range of interest of fp studies ( e.g. @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt_candidates ] right panel ) .",
    "this can cause variations in the observed total @xmath0 of an amount again sufficient to produce a significant fraction of the measured tilt @xcite .",
    "a way to remove most of the uncertainties in the debate about the source of the fp tilt of etgs consists of accurately modelling stellar population , non - homology and dark matter in a quantitative way .",
    "this can be done using dynamical models of the stellar kinematics .",
    "three main techniques have been used in the past decades : ( i ) @xcite numerical orbit - superposition technique ; ( ii ) @xcite made - to - measure particle - based approach and ( iii ) @xcite hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the most popular has been @xcite numerical orbit - superposition technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is able to find the general linear combination of model orbits which best fits the galaxy image and kinematics in exquisite detail ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) .",
    "a downside of the generality of the method is its lack of predictive power . as an example",
    ", one can fit axisymmetric schwarzschild s models to a simulated edge - on barred galaxy . even in this case , both the galaxy image and the kinematics will be reproduced in great detail .",
    "the good fit gives no indication that a bar is present and that the mass model and recovered orbital distribution are significantly in error .",
    "systematic problems in the data can also be easily fitted without raising any concern .",
    "similar strength and limitations are shared by the made - to - measure method @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach consists of solving the @xcite equations of stellar hydrodynamics .",
    "contrary to orbit or particle - based methods , with jeans s method one has to make an assumption about the shape of the velocity ellipsoid in galaxies .",
    "earlier papers assumed a semi - isotropic velocity ellipsoid ( @xmath16 ) , like in jean s original work ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . but more recently",
    ", schwarzschild s models based on multi - slit observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and especially the constraining power of two - dimensional kinematics @xcite , have strongly excluded a semi - isotropic form for the velocity ellipsoid in etgs , making these two - integral models outdated .",
    "however , the availability of good quality two - dimensional stellar kinematics for many galaxies @xcite also revealed that galaxies have a relatively simple and predictable dynamics within @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , by making a simple generalization to jeans s approach , removing the semi - isotropic assumption by allowing for @xmath18 @xcite , one can describe , or essentially `` predict '' , the stellar kinematics of the large majority of real galaxies in surprisingly good detail , using just a couple of free parameters @xcite .",
    "an added advantage of this three - integral anisotropic jeans approach is that it is orders of magnitude faster than the others .",
    "it allows for a quick exploration of parameters space for large samples of galaxies using a bayesian statistical approach .",
    "employing the semi - isotropic jeans approach , and stellar kinematics of 37 galaxies from major / minor axis long - slit observations , it was found that the @xmath0 trend with galaxy mass remains nearly unchanged when one includes the effects of galaxy non - homology @xcite .",
    "the model accuracy was improved by fitting models to two - dimensional stellar kinematics . using a sample of 25 galaxies and both the schwarzschild and jeans approaches",
    ", @xcite found that the @xmath19 relation is extremely tight and accounts for the entire scatter and tilt of the fp .",
    "in other words , when replacing luminosity with mass in the fp , the coefficients of the derived mass plane matched the virial predictions @xmath9 within the errors .",
    "independent confirmations were found by strong lensing studies @xcite .",
    "this result was strengthened by modelling the 260 etgs of the atlas@xmath11  sample with two - dimensional stellar kinematics .",
    "galaxies were found to follow the virial predictions with high accuracy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_plane ] middle ) .",
    "however , the study also pointed out the significant dependence of the plane coefficients on the technique used to measure them @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity can explain the apparent contrast between some of the past studies of the fp tilt .",
    "( _ left panel _ from @xcite ) .",
    "the fp becomes the mass plane , which follows the virial equation with high accuracy ( _ middle panel _ from @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 projections contain the same information , apart from a change of coordinates . in both projections ,",
    "galaxy properties best follow lines of constant @xmath3 ( _ right panel _ ) . in the left and right panels ,",
    "the rainbow colours indicate the @xmath0 . ]",
    "unbiased studies using detailed dynamical models found that the dynamically - derived  was related to the  inferred from stellar population models @xcite .",
    "this confirmed that at least part of the fp tilt is due to stellar population variations .",
    "it agrees with the fact that the scatter around the fp is also linked to variations in the stellar population @xcite .",
    "however , even improving the accuracy of the models using two - dimensional kinematics , the relation between dynamically - derived _ total _ @xmath0 and the stellar population  still showed significant systematic deviations @xcite .",
    "these could only be explained by either dark matter or imf variations between galaxies .",
    "deviations between accurate determinations of the stellar and total masses were also found using independent strong lensing techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to discriminate between dark matter and/or the imf as the reason for the observed mass discrepancies",
    ", one needs to construct dynamical models which explicitly account for both the luminous and dark matter contributions .",
    "unfortunately the problem is intrinsically quite degenerate .",
    "still , using long - slit data and general models for two samples of about 20 galaxies , different studies appeared to agree that ( i ) dark matter represents a minor fraction of the total , within a sphere of radius @xmath22 ; ( ii ) the _ total _ mass profile is nearly isothermal ( @xmath1 ) and produces almost flat circular rotation curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dark_matter ] left and middle ) , similarly to spiral galaxies .",
    "this was measured out to the median radius @xmath23 sampled by the kinematics @xcite and in a few cases out to larger radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dark matter content within  was better quantified with the modelling of the 260 etgs of the atlas@xmath11  sample . a median dark matter",

    "the most likely reason was then a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this was inferred to vary in mass normalization from milky - way type @xcite to heavier than @xcite type , over the full mass range @xcite .",
    "this systematic trend was consistent with indications of a `` heavy '' imf in massive etgs from either stellar population @xcite or strong gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "this variation seems to be naturally explained by some theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the fp is due to virial equilibrium implies that only a modest amount of information on galaxy formation is provided by the mere existence of the plane . instead",
    ", most constraints on galaxy formation are encoded in the distribution of galaxy properties _ within _ the mass plane .",
    "a key empirical finding is that , within the plane , nearly all variation in galaxy properties is best described by a trend with the galaxy @xmath3 , rather than other global parameters like dynamical mass , size , surface brightness or @xcite index ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_plane ] ) .",
    "this is true for the @xmath0 @xcite , stellar population indicators @xcite as well as for the molecular gas fraction , colour and imf @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that @xmath3 is a simple empirical tracer of the galaxy bulge _ mass _ fraction @xcite . and",
    "the correlations of galaxy properties with @xmath3 describe a link between the mass growth in the central bulge and the cessation of the galaxy star formation .",
    "similar results and conclusions are reached when @xmath3 is replaced by a density measure within a fixed aperture @xcite .",
    "this trend between bulge and quenching persists over the full range of galaxies morphological types , going smoothly from nearly bulge - less spiral galaxies , to the most dense disky - ellipticals fast - rotator etgs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spirals_etgs ] ) .",
    "however the bulge trend only exists below a characteristic mass @xmath27 m@xmath28 . above @xmath29",
    "a different process is at work , which produces massive slow rotator etgs with cores in their surface brightness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spirals_etgs ] ) , preferentially lying near the centre of clusters or infalling groups @xcite .",
    "the distinction between the first , bulge - related , quenching and the second , halo - related quenching , can be understood within the framework of hierarchical morphological evolution @xcite , where the massive slow rotating galaxies tend to form most of their mass efficiently at high redshift and generally remain the dominant galaxy of their own environment throughout the hierarchical assembly , starting from small groups to build more massive clusters .",
    "slow rotators sink to the centre of mass of their groups by dynamical friction , where they further grow by dry merging , when the sub - groups merge .",
    "they are quenched when the halo reaches a sufficient mass to shock heat the infalling gas to the virial temperature , which prevents efficient cooling @xcite .",
    "conversely , spiral galaxies form in a more gentle manner and build up their mass over a longer time .",
    "they tend not to dominate the mass of their group during the hierarchical growth .",
    "they swarm at large velocity around the cluster centre of mass , and are quenched by the cluster environment , with insignificant increase in their total masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spirals_etgs ] ) while at the same time growing their bulges and becoming fast rotator etgs @xcite .    defining or revisiting the above picture , is a challenge for the near future .",
    "this effort is currently driven by the synergy between large surveys of the distant universe like candles @xcite and massive detailed studies of the nearby universe using two - dimensional spectroscopy like sami @xcite and manga @xcite , combined with simulations of ever increasing spatial resolution and realism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
