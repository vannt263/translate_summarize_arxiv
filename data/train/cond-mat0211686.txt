    ", we find that the low temperature behavior of the system is insulating .",
    "there is a well defined coulomb gap at low temperatures , which , when the intergrain conductances are large , can differ significantly from the intragrain charging energy .",
    "this behavior is different from the low temperature conductance of a single junction , where the gapless nature of the leads gives rise to a power law dependence of the conductance , due to cotunneling processes .",
    "our results are valid provided that the temperature is much greater than the intradot level spacing . within this restriction , and in the absence of non equilibrium effects , we find no evidence for a phase transition between an insulating and a metallic phase@xcite .",
    "non equilibrium effects can lead to a zero temperature phase transition , in a similar way to the transition which occurs in a single junction .",
    "it is interesting to note that this phase transition remains restricted to zero temperature , even when an array of grains with large coorination number is considered .",
    "this is so because the most favorable case for a metallic regime is when the environment of a given dot is itself metallic .",
    "this reduces the problem to that of a single grain connected to metallic leads , which can not have a finite temperature phase transition , irrespective of the coupling to the leads .",
