    "in the words of sethna _ et al . _ , `` crackling noise arises when a system responds to changing external conditions through discrete , impulsive events spanning a broad range of sizes '' @xcite .",
    "operationally , a broad range of sizes essentially means that the size @xmath0 of the events fluctuates following a power - law distribution , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the probability density of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is the exponent .",
    "this is quite remarkable , as power laws signal the absence of characteristic scales , in this case of event sizes @xcite .",
    "it is also implicit that the driving that makes the external conditions change is relatively small and smooth , quite different from the resulting bursty response ; therefore , crackling noise signals a highly nonlinear behavior .",
    "although these ideas have been developed within the physics of condensed matter @xcite , natural hazards show perhaps the largest number and best illustrations of crackling noise @xcite , including earthquakes @xcite , landslides and rock avalanches @xcite , volcanic eruptions @xcite , rainfall @xcite , hurricanes @xcite , solar flares @xcite , the activity of the magnetosphere @xcite , and perhaps meteorite impacts @xcite ( provided that the earth moves `` slowly '' through space ) .",
    "in other catastrophic phenomena , as forest fires @xcite or the extinctions of biological species @xcite , the events span a broad range of sizes but it is not clear if or in which cases they are power - law distributed .    beyond the geosciences , notable examples of crackling noise arise in physiology and human affairs , like neuronal firings @xcite , epileptic seizures @xcite and appearances of words in texts or speech @xcite ( if the `` size of a word '' is measured by its rarity , i.e. , its position in a ranking of frequencies ) . note that most examples of crackling noise arise in systems with a high degree of complexity , characterized by an enormous number of degrees of freedom that interact between them .",
    "crackling noise can be considered as the most important and apparent property of systems displaying self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "this concept goes one step beyond , and proposes that the origin of the power - law distribution of sizes ( i.e. , the hallmark of crackling noise ) is the existence of a critical point ( analogous to those of equilibrium phase transitions , which are well - known to have scale - invariant properties ) to which the dynamics of the system is attracted by means of a feedback mechanism that balances driving and dissipation @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic example is a sandpile over an open support to which grains are slowly added : when there are few grains , the pile is flat and grain dissipation at the border is low , then the pile grows ; in contrast , when there are too many grains they easily travel through the system and border dissipation is large , so the slope of the pile decreases . at the end ( in the attractor ) , the slope fluctuates around a critical value that balances the input and output of grains , and this state should have scale - invariant properties , i.e. , power - law statistics , as in equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "the behavior of real - world sandpiles is more diverse than what the soc picture suggests , but that is a different story @xcite .",
    "then , soc is a plausible physical mechanism for the emergence of crackling noise , but this does not preclude that other mechanisms could also lead to crackling noise @xcite .    in practice , although it is very simple to test if a system displays crackling noise ( just measuring the size of the events and calculating their distribution , checking that the driving on the system is slow and smooth ) , it is not so easy to demonstrate the existence of soc , as one would need to measure the relations between the internal variables of the system and their fluctuations , and they should behave in the same way as the equivalent ones in an equilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "neither the above definition of crackling noise nor the usual studies of soc pay too much attention on how the discrete and impulsive response events that the system develops occur in time .",
    "is there a unique dynamical process that defines these behaviors ? and in that case , is it periodic ?",
    "is it chaotic ?",
    "is it random ? how does the dynamics reflect the scale - invariant properties of such systems ?",
    "@xcite .",
    "the case of earthquakes exemplifies our poor understanding of the dynamics of this kind of processes @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", there is a widespread belief in the notion of _ characteristic earthquakes _ : the strongest events that a single fault segment is able to generate are always almost the same ( same epicenter , same size , same focal mechanism ) and should occur at regular times @xcite . on the other hand , for extended regions",
    ", it is often assumed that mainshocks come in a total random way , i.e. , from a poisson process , and aftershocks follow a different process @xcite .",
    "kagan has strongly argued against these simplistic views , showing evidence of time clustering in earthquake occurrence , just the behavior opposite to the characteristic - earthquake concept @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that some of the systems mentioned above as prototypical of soc or crackling noise display a remarkable temporal behavior .",
    "for such systems , let us consider the waiting time , also called recurrence time , inter - event time or inter - occurrence time ; this is the time between consecutive events above a size threshold .",
    "so , we take into account only events whose size @xmath0 verifies @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the threshold value ( but notice that for instance in the case of earthquakes one does not distinguish between foreshocks , mainshocks , and aftershocks ) .",
    "this defines a set of occurrence times , @xmath6 , denoting the occurrence of the @xmath7-th event above @xmath5 , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . as each event",
    "is characterized by a unique occurrence time it is assumed that the duration of the event is very short in the scale of observation , and therefore the process can be described as a stochastic _ point process _ @xcite . in addition , each event is also characterized by its size , so the process can be considered a _ marked point process _ , the size being a `` mark '' added to the time occurrence ( we do not consider spatial degrees of freedom in this paper , but see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in any case , the waiting times for events with @xmath4 are obtained straightforwardly as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "the key element of analysis was introduced by bak _",
    "@xcite , by means of a systematic study of the statistics of @xmath12 as a function of the size threshold @xmath5 .",
    "although the rise of @xmath5 only eliminates some values of the occurrence times , leaving the rest unaltered ( i.e. , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , the waiting times are changed in a more complicated way as they add in a variable number to give rise to the larger ( or not ) new waiting times .",
    "usually , for the type of systems that have been studied so far , the waiting times show a large variability , and the best characterization on these processes is by means of the waiting - time probability density @xcite .",
    "what has been found is that for many such systems , these probability densities verify a scaling law .",
    "if for events with @xmath16 we denote the waiting - time probability density by @xmath17 and the mean waiting time by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the scaling law can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a scaling function , independent on @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the shape of the distribution is independent on the scale given by @xmath18 ( which obviously is determined by the threshold @xmath5 ) ; in other words , when the waiting time is measured using as a unit its mean value , the results are independent on the value of @xmath5 , which implies the existence of a self - similarity in the process .",
    "we will argue in the rest of this paper that this is quite a remarkable result in general , difficult to justify with the use of simple stochastic models .",
    "in the case crackling noise or soc systems , the mean waiting verifies @xmath22 , if @xmath23 , and substituting in the scaling law , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scaling function @xmath21 incorporating the factor of proportionality between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "written in this form , the scaling law turns out to be a particular case of the condition of scale invariance for functions with two variables , @xmath28 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "so , although for one variable the condition of scale invariance yields a power law ( for instance , for @xmath0 we have @xmath29 ) , for two variables , like @xmath0 and @xmath28 , scale invariance leads to eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) , with @xmath25 an undetermined function .",
    "crackling - noise or soc systems showing this behavior include earthquakes @xcite , fractures @xcite , solar flares @xcite , literary texts @xcite , or some paradigmatic sandpile models , in contrast with previous belief @xcite .",
    "but this property is shared by other systems for which its crackling - noise nature is in doubt , as printing requests in a computer network @xcite , forest fires @xcite and tsunamis @xcite ( although the latter seem to be power - law distributed @xcite , certainly they are not slowly driven ; rather , they are cracklingly driven by undersea earthquakes and landslides ) .",
    "even systems that do not crackle , as diverse climate records ( temperature , river levels , etc . )",
    "@xcite , or systems for which the crackling behavior is in the derivative of the response signal , as financial indices @xcite , verify a scaling law as eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) when the threshold is large enough that the events above it become extreme events .",
    "the corresponding scaling functions come in a variety of functional forms ; are there any preferred types ?",
    "which is the meaning and depth of the scaling law ( [ scaling ] ) ?",
    "certainly , a _ marked poisson process _ trivially fulfills it .",
    "this is a marked point process in which the occurrence times follow a poisson process , and the sizes of the events ( the `` marks '' ) come from a random distribution independently on occurrence times and other sizes .",
    "its simulation is very simple , with independent identical exponentially distributed waiting times and independent identical power - law distributed sizes ( in the case of crackling - noise systems ) .",
    "indeed , a poisson process is completely characterized by its rate , let us say , 10 events per hour .",
    "if we now raise the size threshold in such a way that half of the events are eliminated and half of them survive , this is equivalent to a _ random thinning _ of the events with a thinning probability equal to @xmath30 ( in which any event has the same probability of being eliminated , independently of the rest ) , due to the fact that the sizes of the events are uncorrelated .",
    "so , we end with a poisson process of rate equal to 5 events per hour .",
    "it is well known how to show this more rigorously .",
    "consider that events are removed from a marked poisson process with a probability @xmath31 , and are kept with probability @xmath32 ; then , the probability that the number of events @xmath33 that survive in a time interval of length @xmath34 is equal to @xmath35 is , @xmath36 = \\sum_{n = k}^\\infty \\pr[n'=k | n = n ] \\pr[n = n],\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes probability , `` @xmath38 '' conditional probability , @xmath39 is the number of events in the interval prior to thinning , and @xmath40 counts all the possible values of @xmath39 . by hypothesis , the original process is poisson of rate @xmath41 , so @xmath42= e^{-\\nu",

    "note that @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 $ ] , and in our context it turns out that @xmath52 .",
    "so , could the trivial marked poisson process explain the scaling law eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) ?",
    "certainly not , as none of the known examples mentioned above are characterized by an exponential scaling function . we should go beyond this trivial explanation .",
    "the shapes of the scaling functions found for the real data mentioned above are rather diverse , including the gamma distribution , the stretched exponential , and the power law for large times .",
    "it seems necessary to incorporate this shape into the point process modeling those systems . the most straightforward way to do",
    "this is through a _",
    "renewal process _ , which is characterized by independent identically distributed waiting times , following a specific distribution @xcite .",
    "if we add to this model independent identically distributed sizes we end with a process that we may call _ marked renewal process_. note that there are no correlations whatsoever in this process , but there is a memory of the last event if the waiting - time distribution is not exponential .",
    "the probability distribution of waiting times for events with @xmath53 can be obtained from the probability distribution for those with @xmath4 , if @xmath54 .",
    "the idea is the same as in the previous subsection but we will use the waiting - time representation rather than the count - number representation of the process .",
    "the same steps as in ref .",
    "@xcite will be followed , although the case here is simpler .",
    "we start using the survivor function , @xmath55   = \\int_\\tau^\\infty   d_{c'}(\\tau)d\\tau$ ] . if an event of size @xmath56 has taken place , the next one with @xmath53 can happen in a variety of ways , depending on the number of events with @xmath57 in between .",
    "so , we can write , @xmath58= s_{c'}(\\tau ) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty   \\pr[\\tau^{(j ) } > \\tau,\\ , s_1<c',\\dots \\ ,",

    "the next step is the scale transformation , which puts the distributions corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath77 on the same scale .",
    "we will obtain this by removing the effect of the decreasing of the rate , which , is proportional to @xmath50 , so , @xmath78 and in laplace space we get @xmath79 therefore , the combined effect of rising the threshold plus rescaling leads to a transformation @xmath80 that acts on the original distribution , @xmath81 we are very interested in the fixed points of this transformation , which are obtained by the solutions @xmath82 of @xmath83 where @xmath69 now means fixed point ; the previous fixed - point equation is totally equivalent to the scaling law ( [ scaling ] ) . introducing the variable @xmath84 and substituting @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the fixed - point equation",
    "we get , separating variables , @xmath87 where we have made both functions equal to an arbitrary constant due to the fact that @xmath50 and @xmath0 are independent variables and so @xmath0 and @xmath88 are ; then , the only way in which the equality could be fulfilled , for all @xmath0 and @xmath88 , is that the function is a constant @xmath89 .",
    "the solution is then @xmath90 which is the laplace transform of an exponential distribution , @xmath91 the dependence on @xmath5 enters by means of @xmath41 , as @xmath92 .",
    "note that this demonstration includes the one on the previous subsection , showing that the marked poisson process displays a scaling law for the waiting - time distribution , but in this case we have achieved a more general result , as the marked poisson process is the only marked renewal process which can fulfill such a scaling law ( when the rescaling is done with the mean waiting time @xmath18 ) .",
    "we can go one step beyond and demonstrate that the marked poisson process is an attractor for the broad family of marked renewal processes for which the mean waiting time @xmath18 is finite .",
    "the iterative application of transformation @xmath80 with a finite probability @xmath50 is equivalent to the limit @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ transf2 ] ) .",
    "expanding that equation up to first order in @xmath50 , using @xmath94 , yields @xmath95 @xmath96 which indeed corresponds to a poisson process when @xmath93 .",
    "this result illustrates the strange particularity of the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) : among the infinite number of probability distributions with a finite mean that can define a marked renewal process , only one type , the one with exponentially distributed waiting times , fulfills the scaling law .",
    "the results can be put in the language of the renormalization group .",
    "indeed , the first part of the process , called thinning , where the threshold is raised from @xmath5 to @xmath77 , corresponds to a decimation of events .",
    "this is analogous to the renormalization of the ising model , where some portion of the spins are eliminated @xcite .",
    "the second part of the process correspond to a change of scale in time , which is equivalent to the change of scale in real space renormalization .",
    "a third step , the renormalization of the field , is not necessary for the purposes of computing waiting - time statistics .",
    "so , the transformation @xmath80 can be considered a renormalization transformation , and we have seen how a renewal process ( with a finite mean ) renormalizes into the trivial poisson fixed point .",
    "so , for all the renewal processes of this kind ( except for a set of zero measure , given by the poisson process ) one expects a change under renormalization , and not scale invariance .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the existence of the scaling law ( [ scaling ] ) is so intriguing .",
    "what happens for renewal processes whose waiting - time density does not have a finite mean ? obviously , a rate can not be defined as the inverse of the mean , nevertheless , still it is possible to follow an approach that makes sense . the first part of our transformation , in which the size threshold is increased from @xmath5 to @xmath77 , does not change ( [ transf1 ] ) ; however , the rescaling with the mean can not be applied .",
    "we will use as a rescaling parameter @xmath97 $ ] , but in contrast to the previous case we will raise @xmath50 to some power @xmath98 in eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to seek for a scaling law of the form @xmath99 where the rate @xmath100 is understood as the number of events per unit time in the time window under consideration .",
    "the transformation @xmath80 [ eq . ( [ transf2 ] ) ] then becomes @xmath101    in the same way as before , the fixed point equation leads to @xmath102 whose solution is @xmath103 with @xmath104 . only for @xmath105 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath106 , this function represents a probability distribution ; this is so because for other values of @xmath107 the expansion of @xmath82 does not correspond to the expansion of a generating function .",
    "however , when @xmath108 a finite mean does not exist .    indeed , for small @xmath0 , @xmath109 ; this corresponds , if @xmath108 , to the laplace transform of @xmath110 , for large @xmath28 , with @xmath111 and @xmath112 the gamma function of @xmath113 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior for large @xmath0 is @xmath114 , and by means of a tauberian theorem the limit behavior for small @xmath28 is @xmath115 .",
    "summarizing , @xmath116 so , two power laws coexists , with exponents @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    which is the basin of attraction of the fixed - point distribution , @xmath119 ?",
    "let us consider @xmath120 for large @xmath28 , with @xmath121 . among the class of functions that do not have a finite mean , these are by far the most important .",
    "we already know that the laplace transform of @xmath17 behaves as @xmath122 , for @xmath123 and so , @xmath124 . substituting into the new equation for @xmath125 , and taking into account that @xmath126 , @xmath127 @xmath128 where we have used that @xmath129 , which , remember , means that the rescaling depends on the power - law exponent of the waiting - time density .",
    "rescaling in this way ensures the existence of an attractor for the waiting - time densities that behave as a power law for long times , and this attractor is given by the fixed point ( [ double_power ] ) .",
    "why does this counterintuitive rescaling provide the fulfillment of a scaling law ?",
    "the reason is in the generalized central limit theorem .",
    "imagine that @xmath130 , so we remove half of the events ; in order to recover the original pattern ( characterized by the same waiting - time probability density ) we need to multiply the time interval under consideration not by @xmath131 but by @xmath132 , which is larger than @xmath133 for @xmath121 .",
    "this is due to the fact that as the process evolves in time , longer waiting times appear , due to their power - law tail , being necessary to consider far longer time intervals .",
    "reference @xcite puts numbers into this simple intuitive explanation . the total time interval up to the @xmath134th event is @xmath135 .",
    "the largest waiting time @xmath136 among the @xmath39 values of the waiting time can be estimated as @xmath137 , this yields @xmath138 for large @xmath39 , and this means that during the time interval of lenght @xmath139 the process `` does not see '' the tail of @xmath17 beyond @xmath136 and one can effectively truncate the distribution at this value .",
    "then , the `` typical '' value of @xmath139 can be associated to the mean value of the truncated distribution , so @xmath140 , and in this way the total time up to the @xmath134th event scales in the same way as the largest waiting time .",
    "indeed , the generalization of the central limit theorem introduces rigor in this argument , see for instance ref .",
    "if the @xmath141 s are power - law distributed , with a tail @xmath142 , the standard central limit theorem does not hold for @xmath143 and one has to apply its generalization .",
    "rescaling @xmath139 as @xmath144 the theorem states that the variable @xmath145 has as a limit distribution , for @xmath146 , one of the so called levy stable distributions ( whose mathematical form is not relevant for our purposes ) .",
    "coming back to our problem , there is a particular value of @xmath107 for which the exact inverse laplace transform of the fixed - point distribution can be easily obtained . indeed ,",

    ".    can these results be useful for crackling - noise systems or other complex systems ?",
    "solar flares , when they are close to the minimum of the solar cycle @xcite , and also e - mail activity from individuals @xcite and human - movement episodes @xcite show power - law distributed waiting times , with exponents @xmath118 about 1.5 , 1 , and 1.8 , respectively . however , there are no indications of a second power law with exponent @xmath117 , as requested by our theoretical calculations .    nevertheless , these are peculiar systems ; first , in the case of solar flares , the thresholds that define the waiting - time distributions are not size thresholds but intensity thresholds ( size is defined as the integral of intensity over time ) , and it is not clear how this change can modify the properties of the system .",
    "in addition , the scaling which defines the scaling law is done with the mean rate , as it would correspond to a distribution with a well - defined mean .",
    "second , for human movements and e - mail activity , the scaling law is not achieved by means of a thinning of the process through the increasing of a threshold , rather , individuals with different rates are compared . and as a fourth example we could consider the btw sandpile model , whose behavior ( and the approach with which it has been studied ) is very similar to that of solar flares , with a waiting - time exponent around 1.7 @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite introduced a very simple point process in which each waiting time was correlated with the size of the previous event , in such a way that waiting times following larger events were drawn from a waiting - time density with a short characteristic time and waiting times after small events had a longer characteristic time .",
    "the transformation of the waiting time density when the threshold is increased and the time is rescaled verifies an equation which is a generalization of the previous cases , @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the laplace transform of @xmath162 , which is the probability density of the waiting time that follows an event of size @xmath163 ; more precisely @xmath164 .    as in the last subsections , for @xmath93 we can write @xmath165 and @xmath166 , where @xmath167 , which gives the scale of the distribution , may depend on @xmath50 , increasing as @xmath93 . substituting in the equation for the transformation @xmath80 , @xmath168 @xmath169 with , as usual , @xmath170 ; so , whatever the dependence of @xmath167 on @xmath50 , the shape of @xmath162 is totally irrelevant to determine the asymptotic behavior of the process , provided that @xmath171 when @xmath126 .",
    "this demonstrates that for the simple model we are considering , short - range correlations are not enough to escape from the attraction of the renewal fixed - point distributions . for the case of processes with a finite mean ,",
    "a demonstration was already provided by molchan , but the author believes the one here is more direct @xcite .",
    "we have seen how , when a mean waiting time exists , a process without correlations can not account for the appearance of a scaling law for waiting - time distributions ( except in the trivial case of a marked poisson process , which is not observed in real systems ) . in the same way , when a process without correlations is characterized by the absence of a finite mean waiting - time , the theoretical results do not compare well with observations either .",
    "therefore , correlations build the shape of the waiting - time distribution in crackling - noise as well as non - crackling noise systems ( at least for the cases studied so far , see sec . [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "but short - range correlations do not seem enough to break the dominance of the trivial poisson fixed point when a mean exists , or the double power - law distributions expected when the mean does not exist , as we have shown for the simple example introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . as in equilibrium critical phenomena",
    "@xcite , long - range correlations should be necessary in order to escape from the basin of attraction of the trivial fixed point .",
    "further research is necessary regarding this issue , both from a fundamental point of view and with the goal of finding stochastic models of the systems displaying scaling laws .",
    "a promising approach is that of lennartz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where a long - range correlated series of magnitudes is generated , associating each magnitude value to a discrete time ( the authors have in mind earthquakes , but the results are more general ) .",
    "then , only extreme events , i.e. , events above a large magnitude threshold , are considered , and the corresponding waiting - time statistics is obtained , with a surprising agreement with observational earthquake data @xcite .",
    "in other words , starting with a delta distribution of waiting times for the initial process , renormalization leads to a nontrivial fixed point .",
    "it is an open question why this is so .",
    "the fact that a nontrival ( nonexponential ) scaling law for waiting - time distributions may exist has been criticized by molchan @xcite and saichev and sornette @xcite . assuming that seismic occurrence is well described by the etas model , the latter authors were able to derive the form of the waiting - time probability density .",
    "here we just mention that the etas ( epidemic type aftershock sequence ) model is the simplest modeling of the process of earthquake triggering that puts all earthquakes on the same footing : any earthquake triggers other events with a probability that is proportional to two main factors : the omori law , which controls the decay in time of the seismic rate , and the productivity law , which links the rate with the magnitude of the triggering earthquake . in addition , the magnitudes of the resulting triggered earthquakes are drawn independently from the gutenberg - richter distribution . despite its simplicity , the mathematical treatment of the etas model becomes an authentic _ tour de force_. in any case , saichev and sornette get that @xmath17 fulfills something like a scaling relation , eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , but with a scaling function which is not a only function of the rescaled waiting time , @xmath172 \\exp \\left ( - ( 1-n ) x - \\frac n { 1-\\theta } \\epsilon^\\theta x^{1-\\theta } \\right).\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is the exponent of the decay of the rate with time , given by the omori law ( @xmath174 ) , @xmath175 is the branching parameter , defining the number of events triggered directly by any event , and @xmath176 , with @xmath177 the small time constant that avoids divergence at zero time in the omori law .",
    "so , in addition to the dependence on the rescaled waiting time @xmath178 , the density depends on the rate @xmath41 through @xmath179 , in contrast with the idea of scale invariance .",
    "the fact that the etas model does not fulfill an exact scaling law does not seem highly surprising , after all , due to the fact that the etas model itself is not fully self - similar @xcite . at the end , for vanishing rate , @xmath180 , it turns out that @xmath181 tends to an exponential distribution , and then the etas model renormalizes into the trivial poisson process .",
    "it would be of the maximum interest to calculate if real self - similar models , as the vere - jones model @xcite or the lippiello - godano - de arcangelis model @xcite fulfill the scaling relation @xmath182 and which is the corresponding scaling function .",
    "this is of course an unsolved problem .    as a final comment ,",
    "let us mention that the models used in this paper are purely stochastic , or mathematical .",
    "some readers , however , could ask for a more physical approach . for the author , the situation is analog to the study of diffusion processes using random - walk models @xcite : the outcome is robust and independent on small details about the nature of interactions ( molecular collisions in one case and event - event triggering mechanisms in the other )",
    ". nevertheless , there are examples of crackling systems that have been successfully modeled on physical grounds , using for instance the random field ising model @xcite , the so called abbm model @xcite , or models of dislocation dynamics in plastic deformation @xcite .",
    "it would be of the maximum interest to explore the time structure of events in those models .",
    "regarding the geosciences , which are the systems we have in mind for this paper , the situation is more complicated , as the physics of those phenomena is still poor understood , and controlled experiments can not be performed .",
    "it is a great challenge to find microscopic models of natural catastrophes that give rise to the self - organized structures that emerge in the long - run limit in those systems .",
