    "the study of multiparticle production in hard processes provides one with an important information about both the qcd partonic branching processes and the transition from the coloured partons to the colourless hadrons .",
    "the vast amount of experimental data collected in various hard collisions processes convincingly confirms that the inclusive characteristics of qcd jet systems can be successfully described within the analytical perturbative approach to multiparticle production , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the so - called modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) @xcite and on the concept of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experiment clearly demonstrates that the bright colour coherence effects survive the hadronization stage and are distinctively visible in the data .",
    "this has been known for quite a long time for annihilation processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . recently the very impressive data from hera @xcite and from the tevatron @xcite have become available .",
    "the lphd allows one to relate the ( sufficiently ) inclusive hadronic observables to the corresponding quantities computed for the cascading partonic system .",
    "one of the well known ( but still striking ) predictions of the perturbative scenario is the depletion of the soft particle production and the resulting approximately gaussian shape of the inclusive distribution in the variable @xmath10for particles with energy @xmath11 in a jet of energy @xmath12 ( the so - called `` hump - backed plateau '' ) @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is observed in all inclusive energy distributions ; the charged particle spectrum for not too small momenta prove to be in surprisingly good agreement with the mlla - lphd predictions reflecting the qcd cascading picture of multiple hadroproduction .",
    "moreover , the data collected in various hard scattering processes ( , dis , @xmath13 ) clearly demonstrate a remarkable universality of particle spectra assuming the proper ( mlla - based ) choice of the cascading evolution variables , equivalent to the @xmath14 energy @xmath15 .",
    "the most challenging is the soft momentum end of the particle spectra ( p  @xmath16gev ) where the non - perturbative dynamics could invalidate the perturbatively based expectations .",
    "an attempt to stretch the perturbative predictions to the limit of their applicability ( or better to say , beyond it ) has been performed in previous papers of the present authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these papers",
    "it was shown that ( after the proper modifications ) the perturbatively based formulae allow a sufficiently smooth transition into the soft momentum domain .",
    "the non - perturbative hadronization effects are encoded in the transverse momentum cutoff @xmath17 which can be motivated by the space - time picture of hadroproduction in qcd jets , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "explicit predictions for distributions of hadrons in the soft region need some additional assumptions on mass effects .",
    "scaling phenomena are expected to be of more general nature .",
    "let us recall that the gluons of long wave length are emitted by the total colour current which is independent of the internal structure of the jet and is conserved when the partons split .",
    "applying the lphd hypothesis one then expects that the hadron spectrum at very low momenta @xmath18 should be nearly independent of the jet energy @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the low momentum data support the basic ideas of qcd coherence and lphd .",
    "quantitatively , the analysis was performed in terms of the invariant particle density @xmath19 for annihilation into hadrons at low momenta in quite a wide @xmath14 energy region ( from adone to lep-2 ) .",
    "the spectra were found to be in a good agreement with the scaling behaviour and with analytical perturbative expectations which became sensitive to the running of the coupling @xmath20 at small scales @xcite .",
    "the new h1 data@xcite follow these predictions as well , thus confirming the universality of soft particle production .",
    "in this paper we study further the phenomenology of the soft particle production for both the charged and identified hadrons .",
    "the analytical calculations are compared with the quantity @xmath21 which has some practical advantages over the invariant density considered before .",
    "we derive a scaling prediction for particles at low transverse but arbitrary longitudinal momenta , which generalizes our previous results and which for very small @xmath22 explains the so - called fan - invariance  experimentally observed long ago  @xcite .",
    "an important test of this line of approach towards soft particle production is the sensitivity to the colour charge of the primary emitters : the density of low momentum particles roughly doubles when going from a primary @xmath3 to a @xmath4 antenna .",
    "it is interesting to note that this prediction applies to the soft particles already at present energies , whereas for the total multiplicity this doubling needs much higher energies .",
    "the sensitivity of the low momentum particle density to the primary colour charges can be studied in experimentally accessible processes , such as in @xmath23 jets @xcite . here",
    "this process is discussed further and we derive predictions for the soft particle production in quark and gluon exchange reactions which are observed in photoproduction or dis at hera or in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "in refs . @xcite an approximate solution of the mlla evolution equation for the inclusive energy distribution @xmath24 of soft gluons , originating from a primary parton @xmath25 , has been derived .",
    "this solution can be written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 here we have used the logarithmic variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath11 the particle energy and @xmath31 the jet virtuality @xmath32 for a jet of primary momentum @xmath12 and half opening angle @xmath33 ) ; @xmath34 is the respective colour factor , i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xmath37 denotes the anomalous dimension of multiplicity and is related to the @xmath38 running coupling by @xmath39 or @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; @xmath43 is the qcd - scale and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the numbers of colours and of flavours respectively , @xmath46 . the shower evolution is terminated by the transverse momentum cut - off @xmath47 .",
    "the first term in ( [ duetermini ] ) corresponds to the emission of a single gluon and yields the leading contribution for @xmath48 .",
    "it is proportional to the colour charge of the primary parton .",
    "furthermore , this term does not depend on the @xmath14 energy , contrary to the higher order terms which provide the rise of the spectrum for large @xmath11 with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "the spectrum vanishes at @xmath48 as @xmath49    in order to relate parton and hadron distributions at low momentum @xmath50 , one has to make some additional assumptions on how to include mass effects . in @xcite",
    "it was required that the invariant density @xmath51 for hadrons approaches a constant limit when @xmath52 as observed experimentally .",
    "here it is worth to recall that at low @xmath18 @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the standard analogues of the dis structure functions @xmath55 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as well known , @xmath56 are related to the matrix elements of the current commutators and should be regular when @xmath52 .    for spectra which vanish as in ( [ dslimit ] ) a plausible relation between partons and hadrons can be achieved by relating their distributions as @xcite @xmath57 at the same energies @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a normalization parameter .",
    "if hadrons from both hemispheres are added , @xmath60 should be replaced by 2@xmath60 . for large energies @xmath61 ( [ phrel ] )",
    "coincides with the usual lphd relation @xmath62 .    in @xcite",
    "we have considered the invariant density @xmath63 in the limit of vanishing rapidity @xmath64 and transverse momentum @xmath22 or , equivalently , for vanishing momentum @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 where the factor 1/2 takes into account that both hemispheres are added in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "then , since @xmath68 for small @xmath18 , the invariant hadronic density @xmath69 approaches the finite , energy independent limit as in ( [ izero ] ) @xmath70 in the fixed @xmath71 limit @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath37 and @xmath73 . with prescription ( [ phrel ] ) one obtains a good description of the moments of the energy spectrum @xmath74 by the mlla formulae with @xmath17 = 270 mev in a wide energy range @xcite , as well as of the particle spectrum in the soft region ( @xmath75 gev ) @xcite .",
    "certainly at the moment there is no unique recipe allowing one to perform a smooth transition between the perturbative and non - perturbative regimes .",
    "also there are certain approximations involved in the analytical results for low energy particles . in refs .",
    "@xcite an alternative prescription has been discussed : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the so - called limiting spectrum @xcite which solves the mlla evolution equations for @xmath78 = 0 in the full kinematic region , except very close to the boundary @xmath79 = y. at this phase space boundary the limiting spectrum approaches the finite limit @xmath80 , which equals numerically 1.069  ( 1.055 ) for @xmath45=3(5 ) .    basing on the prescription ( [ phrel2 ] ) one arrives at the alternative formula for the invariant hadronic density which in the case of annihilation reads @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "as it is easy to see this prescription also guarantees that the hadronic density reaches a constant limit at @xmath52 .",
    "we shall compare here the expectation based on eq .",
    "( [ phrells ] ) with the experimental data for charged pions @xmath83 .",
    "the mlla limiting spectrum taken at @xmath84 = 150 mev has been found to provide a good description of pion spectra at relativistic energies , see e.g. @xcite . recall that the low momentum region in charged particle spectra is dominated by the pions .",
    "the energy dependence of the soft particle production rate was investigated previously for annihilation in terms of the invariant particle density @xmath85 in the wide energy interval ( from adone to lep-2 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , new data on soft particle production became available from dis at hera @xcite . in the following we compare various results for the quantity @xmath86 as a function of the momentum @xmath87 of the registered particle . when presented in terms of this observable",
    "the data points are independent of the choice of the theoretical parameter @xmath17 ; in this case , however , we are dealing with a quantity which is not directly related to the lorentz - invariant phase space . using this quantity may facilitate the comparison between different experimental results .",
    "1 shows the momentum dependence of @xmath86 for various @xmath14 energies @xmath15 in annihilation in comparison with the theoretical predictions . in fig .",
    "1a the distributions of charged particles are presented in comparison with the approximate mlla result ( [ dmlla ] ) with prescription ( [ phrel ] ) for the relation between partons and hadrons .",
    "the theoretical prediction describes well the approach to the scaling limit for low momenta and also the shape and energy dependence of the spectra with the choice @xmath88 mev , as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "the detailed behaviour at the very small momenta @xmath89 depends on the approximation at the parton level involving large production angles ( @xmath90 ) and also on the assumed relation between partons and hadrons in this region .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "1b , where we show the theoretical predictions with the alternative choice of the low momentum behaviour discussed in sect .",
    "2 , based on the approximate analytical mlla solution for @xmath91 ( limiting spectrum ) and relation ( [ phrel2 ] ) ; this form describes the pion spectra for @xmath92 gev with the mass parameter @xmath93 mev which is in agreement with the earlier fits to the pion spectra @xcite . with this prescription",
    "the particle production rate in the soft limit @xmath94 is lower than in fig .",
    "1a , but it also approaches an energy independent value in this limit and that is the essential prediction of the qcd approach based on coherent soft gluon emission .",
    "looking at the data in fig . 1 more closely , there seems to be a certain increase of the soft particle rate at lep energies .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 a and b where the data below and above @xmath95 gev respectively in annihilation show separately a very good approach to an energy independent limit at small @xmath87 , whereas there is a difference in absolute rates of 20 - 30% in the two energy regions .",
    "this is also visible in fig .",
    "3a where we show the @xmath14 energy dependence of three values of the momentum @xmath87 .",
    "we also include here the recent data from hera @xcite which closely match the results . at the lowest momentum @xmath96 gev",
    "we see an almost energy independent production rate , but a small jump at the lep-1 energy is visible . a rise at the higher energies could partially be caused by the weak decay products of heavy quark particles ( perhaps also particles with strange quarks ) which would add incoherently to the spectrum of particles produced directly from the soft gluons .",
    "this could happen in particular at the @xmath97 because of the larger branching ratio into @xmath98-quarks .",
    "however , the experiment @xcite clearly shows that at low momenta ( @xmath99 gev ) the effect induced by the @xmath100 events is below 5% .",
    "it would be interesting to clarify quantitatively in more details which part of the observed rise could be explained by the overall effect of the weak decays .",
    "a certain small increase of the rate is actually also expected from the theory at the nonzero momenta ( see the curves in fig .",
    "3a ) . for larger",
    "momenta the rise of the production rate with energy is more pronounced and this trend is reproduced by the theoretical calculation for the full range of energy where the data are available ( @xmath101 gev ) .    an approximate energy independence of the rate for the low momentum kaons and protons is well tested for @xmath92 gev where data at some common low momentum value are available . a comparison in figs . 3a and",
    "3b suggests that the spectra become practically energy independent when the particle momenta are of the order of their mass or smaller .",
    "it should be noted that the energy independence of the soft particle rate is by no means trivial .",
    "we recall , in particular , that the particle density @xmath102 at central rapidity @xmath103 rises with @xmath14 energy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 for tasso and opal data where rather precise results are available at @xmath104 gev .",
    "whereas in this energy range ( 14 to 91 gev ) the plateau height rises by about 70% the corresponding rise for the soft particles at @xmath104 gev is only about 10% .",
    "this is consistent with the qcd picture of particle production : the central plateau rises asymptotically with the same exponent @xmath105 as the full particle multiplicity and this rise comes mainly from the high transverse momentum particles .",
    "the soft particle production is suppressed because of the coherence in the emission from all colour sources .      in fig .",
    "5 we consider for different identified particles with mass @xmath106 the rescaled spectra @xmath107 which are expected to approach energy independent dimensionless numbers in the soft limit @xmath94 .",
    "first we see again , that in the pion spectra the violation of energy independence occurs at lower momenta than in the spectra of the heavier particles .",
    "furthermore , these rescaled spectra of pions and kaons , separated by an order of magnitude around @xmath108 gev seem to converge towards a common value in the soft limit .",
    "a similar convergence is also suggested for the protons although the lack of precise data at small momenta exclude a firm conclusion .",
    "we find an approximate universality of the quantity @xmath109 for the particle species considered here .",
    "this corresponds to our previous observation @xcite that the invariant density behaves like @xmath110 in the soft limit . in our theoretical picture",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath111 ( and not @xmath112 , for example ) .",
    "to the extent that @xmath17 is related to the particle mass such a universality could be anticipated .",
    "it would be interesting to have more experimental information on low momentum particles to test better the validity of such a universal behaviour ; new hera data with identified particles at such small momenta could be helpful as well .",
    "as discussed before the gluon spectrum in the soft limit becomes independent of energy of the primary parton above about 1 gev .",
    "this energy independence can be observed , for example , in the @xmath14 of annihilation or in the breit frame of dis .",
    "this result can be easily generalized .",
    "we make a lorentz transformation along the initial parton direction , then in the new frame the initial partons have different energies but the soft particle production rate should remain unaltered as long as the primary energies are still sufficiently large ( and the colour of the primary parton has not changed ) . consequently , the quantity @xmath114 should be independent of rapidity @xmath64 for such transformations @xcite and this behaviour should still hold approximately for @xmath22 not much larger than the hadron masses . therefore ,",
    "if the coherence argument is applied to this class of frames one obtains the prediction of scaling for the distribution @xmath115 equivalently , for @xmath116 with production angle @xmath117 one expects @xmath118 an approximate scaling behaviour of this type  but for the distributions normalized to unity  was found by the tasso collaboration @xcite in the energy range from 14 to 34 gev long ago and was called fan invariance  . in the following we will show explicitly how this scaling behaviour arises in the perturbative qcd calculations ; furthermore we predict how the abovementioned scaling behaviour is violated .",
    "this will lead to the suggestion of other variables in which scaling is restored in a wider kinematical region .",
    "the double differential distribution @xmath119 in @xmath120 and angle @xmath117 is derived from the @xmath121-distribution of particles @xmath122 in a jet of half opening angle @xmath123 by ( see also @xcite ) @xmath124 with @xmath125 for small angles . for larger angles",
    "an appropriate variable is @xmath126 instead of @xmath127 @xcite . for the application at small @xmath22",
    "we take the approximate expression  ( [ dmlla ] ) for @xmath128 and obtain ( with @xmath129 ) @xmath130 within the dla this distribution ( the first factor in the first term ) is given by @xmath131   \\label{dndla}\\ ] ] @xmath132    for small @xmath22 the first term in the brackets from the single gluon bremsstrahlung dominates and is energy independent .",
    "this is the term which corresponds to the flat plateau  of radiation in the low @xmath22 limit ; it is also responsible for the fan invariance  as follows from the exact relation @xmath133 with @xmath134 defined in terms of the momentum @xmath87 .",
    "the second term gives the energy dependent correction which vanishes in the soft limit @xmath135 ; the @xmath14 energy @xmath15 enters only through the variable @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "the mlla correction involves the exponent @xmath138 and its derivative @xmath139 so it again depends only on @xmath140 and @xmath121 ( for soft particles one can assume @xmath141 ) .",
    "therefore our perturbative results fulfil the scaling law @xmath142 i.e. the dependence on the @xmath14 energy enters only through the variable @xmath121 or @xmath143 . in this way the violation of the fan invariance  can be partly absorbed into the scaling variables @xmath121 or @xmath143 .",
    "the analytical predictions have been derived for the soft gluon radiation ( with energies smaller than , say , @xmath144(1 gev ) ) , while the angles are measured with respect to the primary parton axis .",
    "there are two effects which are beyond the perturbative calculations .",
    "first , the direction of the primary parton is not directly known , but may be related to the jet axis or to the initial hadron or photon direction . here",
    "the situation can be improved by measuring the energy - multiplicity correlation @xcite taking the momentum of each particle in the event in turn as jet axis with the particle energy fraction as a weight .",
    "the angular correlation of this type has been studied using monte carlo events with favourable results @xcite .",
    "secondly , we can only perform calculations at the parton level , so in comparison with experiment an assumption on the effect of hadronization has to be made .",
    "this will be described in the next subsection .      according to the lphd concept",
    ", we assume that parton and hadron spectra are proportional to each other if momenta are large compared to @xmath17 .",
    "this picture has so far only been applied to observables which are integrated over @xmath113 , while we are now interested in distributions differential in @xmath113 .",
    "since perturbative formulae explicitly contain the cut - off @xmath145 , they can not indeed be directly compared with the data at small @xmath113 , but they have to be modified in order to provide a smooth behaviour in this region . there is no unique prescription to be followed in order to build this bridge between parton and hadron level , and what we are proposing here is a simple phenomenological ansatz which is consistent with kinematical requirements and the scaling behaviour in the soft limit .    in analogy to the relation ( [ phrel ] ) applied to the energy spectra in section 2 , we take the transverse momentum cut - off @xmath17 as an effective mass of the hadron with @xmath146 and we then replace @xmath147 in eqs .",
    "( [ dnmlla ] ) and ( [ dndla ] ) on the @xmath148 as well as on the @xmath149 this choice guarantees the proper kinematical limits @xmath150 and @xmath151 for parton and hadron spectra , while they coincide for large @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore we use as before @xmath152 .",
    "so for hadrons one can write ( dropping the label @xmath153 everywhere ) @xmath154 with the function @xmath155 defined by ( [ ffun ] ) at the parton level , whereby the replacements ( [ htop ] ) are applied .",
    "once again , relations such as ( [ htop ] ) are not an essential part of the perturbative lphd picture , rather they should be considered as a plausible extension into the region @xmath156 , consistent with kinematics and scaling properties .    combining now ( [ edndpkt ] ) and ( [ fandef ] ) , one obtains quantitative theoretical predictions for the angular distribution of particles .",
    "results for different values of @xmath157 at @xmath15 = 14 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ figfan ] for @xmath17 = 0.5 gev and @xmath158 .",
    "choosing such parameters , the results describe reasonably well the experimental data obtained by the tasso collaboration@xcite in the region of low @xmath157 , while some deviation is visible for larger values of @xmath157 is largely determined by the position of the maximum in the angular distribution and is larger than the value taken above for the energy spectrum .",
    "a unification is possible in principle by calculating the energy spectrum from the integration over the modified double differential spectrum @xmath159 , but this is not attempted here . ] .",
    "the large values of @xmath160 and of angles correspond , however , to large values of the transverse momentum @xmath113 , where our approximations are not valid any more .",
    "this point is particularly important for the study of `` fan invariance '' , i.e. , the energy independence of the renormalized angular distribution : the distributions presented by the tasso collaboration@xcite are normalized to unity in the full angular region and therefore not directly accessible by our calculations .    a better test of the scaling law  ( [ fan ] )",
    "can be obtained from the direct study of the double differential distribution @xmath161 in absolute normalization ( i.e. , normalized to the particle multiplicity ) as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath113 at fixed @xmath160 .",

    "[ figfan ] at @xmath160 = 0.8 gev at four different values of @xmath14 energy @xmath15 .",
    "a good scaling behaviour is visible in the region of very low transverse momentum , whereas the position of the peak and the tail are found to smoothly depend on the @xmath14 energy .",
    "if the distributions were rescaled to the same area as in @xcite , the overall energy dependence would be rather small .    in order to better understand the origin of this energy dependence , it is useful to separately look at the contribution of the different terms in the theoretical formula .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ approx ] , where the @xmath162 distributions at @xmath160 = 0.8 gev and @xmath15 = 34 gev are shown for different approximations : the dla ( born term only ) , dla ( born plus next order term ) and mlla .",
    "whereas the born term of dla , which is independent of @xmath14 energy , is dominant at small @xmath113 , the other terms become important with increasing @xmath113 and give rise to the energy dependence visible in fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "as the next order term becomes important for larger @xmath113 , we also compare in fig .",
    "[ approx ] with the prediction from the limiting spectrum which corresponds to an all order summation within a high energy approximation ( taking the same @xmath17 , @xmath78 = 0 and normalization ( @xmath60 = 3.5 ) adjusted to match the mlla result ) .",
    "it is remarkable how close are the predictions from the mlla and from the limiting spectrum .",
    "this result suggests that retaining only the first two terms in the dla solution gives indeed a reasonable approximation in the region of low transverse momentum .",
    "the deviation from the scaling behaviour  ( [ fan ] ) is due to the weak logarithmic dependence of the correction terms on the primary energy . as a consequence of  ( [ edndpkt ] ) with @xmath163 the invariant density ,",
    "after our modification  ( [ htop ] ) , still follows the scaling behaviour @xmath164 i.e. , for fixed @xmath113 it depends on particle and @xmath14 energies only through @xmath165 .",

    "( [ fan ] ) .",
    "the nearly energy independent soft end of the particle spectrum has been interpreted above as a consequence of the coherent soft gluon emission together with the lphd .",
    "alternatively , one may argue that at these low momenta of few hundred mev we observe the purely hadronic phenomena not related to the perturbative qcd at all .",
    "it is therefore important to test further the perturbative nature of the soft particle production .",
    "the production rate in the limit ( [ izero ] ) can not be predicted in absolute terms , but we note the dependence of this rate on the colour charge factors @xmath166 and @xmath44 for the jets originating from a primary quark or gluon respectively .",
    "therefore , we have argued in @xcite that the sensitivity of the soft end of the spectrum to the colour of the primarily produced hard partons provides a crucial test of the perturbatively based picture and can teach us about the region of its validity .",
    "the prediction for the ratio of multiplicities in gluon and quark jets @xmath167 has been made long ago @xcite but holds only at asymptotic energies . at existing energies",
    "this ratio is measured to be smaller but not in disagreement with the perturbative qcd analysis ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "our present discussion concerns only the soft particles : in this kinematic regime the asymptotic predictions on the spectrum , in particular the scaling properties , are well satisfied and therefore the asymptotic ratio @xmath168 in this limit could be asymptotic too without contradicting the global results .    therefore , in order to test this scenario , one would like to compare the soft particle production in @xmath3 and @xmath4 events . whereas there are well measured spectra down to small momenta of about 200 mev from quark jets in and dis processes ( see figs",
    ". 1 and 2 ) the direct production of a @xmath4 final state is more difficult . may become a prospective source of clear information @xcite ] to perform such a comparison nevertheless we have discussed in @xcite two different approaches .",
    "first , there is the comparatative study of two jet events arising from reactions with primary hadrons and photons mediated by quark or gluon exchange processes .",
    "if the exchange is sufficiently hard the two types of processes yield primary colour sources of the desired @xmath3 and @xmath4 types .",
    "we will dicuss below how these limits can be derived explicitely from the hard scatterings in the limit of small momentum transfer .",
    "the phenomenological studies along this line are described in papers @xcite .",
    "secondly , one may consider final states with more than two partons .",
    "in certain collinear limits such final states approach a @xmath3 or @xmath4 type antennae .",
    "a simple example is provided by the process @xmath169 which for the configurations with angle @xmath170 or @xmath171 behaves like a @xmath3 and for @xmath172 behaves like a @xmath4 final state @xcite .",
    "such extreme configurations are in general not realistic .",
    "however , we can study the radiation perpendicular to the event plane ( say , in the cone with not too large opening angle @xmath173 ) , then the particle density at low momenta should vary by the factor @xmath174 when going from the @xmath3 to the @xmath4 type configuration and this variation can be predicted also for the intermediate kinematical range .",
    "similarly , one can study such an associated perpendicular radiation in parton - parton scattering processes with quark or gluon exchange at any angle ( see fig .",
    "9 ) .    in the following we will present the expectations for various processes ; the main results for @xmath169 have been given already in @xcite .",
    "it was realized long ago that the overall structure of soft particle angular distribution in multijet events in hard processes is governed by the underlying dynamics of colour at small distances .",
    "an instructive known example is the perturbative explanation @xcite of the particle angular flow in @xmath175 events ( string effect ",
    "the multiplicity flows build up a colour portrait of an event which can be used as a natural partonometer  mapping the primary interaction short - distance process @xcite . in these studies the drag effect on the particles within the production plane is caused by the primary colour dipoles .",
    "more recently , the azimuthal angular distribution around the jet directions @xcite have been studied .",
    "the partonometry ideas are strongly supported by a wealth of experimental data from @xmath175 annihilation ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the tevatron @xmath176 collider @xcite .    in the present application we are interested in the particle production at low momenta @xmath87 of order @xmath17 .",

    "this offers the possibility to study the angular dependence of the soft particle production in the same process .",
    "the analytical perturbative approach to multiparticle production together with the assumption of lphd has proven to be very successful in the description of various inclusive characteristics of jets .",
    "it is of importance to investigate further the potential and limitations of this picture , in particular in the soft region where hadronization effects could in principle wash out the perturbative predictions .",
    "the soft particles follow a striking prediction of the perturbative analysis .",
    "the particle density at low momentum is nearly energy independent over two orders of magnitude in the @xmath14 energy of @xmath279 annihilation and this behaviour is supported now also by the data from @xmath280 collisions . more generally ,",
    "the analytic calculations suggest a scaling law for particles at low transverse momentum ; such a property was observed already long ago in the petra energy range .",
    "the scaling law is derived analytically for soft gluons which are emitted coherently from all other more energetic colour sources . in the perturbative description",
    "this process of single gluon emission is dominated by the born term of @xmath281 which is energy independent . at larger @xmath113 gluons",
    "are more frequently produced through cascading processes of higher order in @xmath71 .",
    "remarkably , the hadrons follow this prediction demonstrating the relevance of lphd also for soft particles .",
    "it is very important to further clarify whether the observed scaling behaviour is just a general property of hadronization or should be considered as consequence of the perturbative qcd as in our picture . in the latter case",
    "the density of the low momentum particles should vary in a well defined way with the type of reactions and orientations of the primary partons in the hard process . in this paper",
