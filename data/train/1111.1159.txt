    "the purpose of this paper is to report a robust method for reconstructing the detailed shape of a singular attractive potential from some of the bound - state spectral data that it generates .",
    "the general setting for the problem is the discrete spectrum of a schrdinger hamiltonian operator @xmath14 where @xmath5 is the shape of an attractive central potential , and @xmath15 is a coupling parameter .",
    "we shall assume that the potential is monotone non - decreasing and no more singular than the coulomb potential @xmath16 the arguments we use apply generally to the problem in @xmath17 spatial dimensions , but , for definiteness , we shall usually assume that @xmath18 the operator inequality @xcite @xmath19 implies that a discrete spectrum exists for sufficiently large coupling @xmath15 .",

    "an explicit example of the class of problems we consider is provided by the hulthn potential whose shape is given by @xmath23 and whose s - state ( @xmath24 ) eigenvalues @xmath25 are given @xcite exactly for @xmath26 by the formula @xmath27 the problem discussed in the present paper may be stated as follows : given , for example , the curve @xmath28 can we use this spectral data to reconstruct the potential shape @xmath5 ?",
    "we call this ` geometric spectral inversion ' .",
    "it must be distinguished from ` inverse scattering theory ' @xcite , and , in particular , from ` the inverse problem in the coupling parameter ' @xcite . in this latter problem ,",
    "the energy eigenvalue @xmath1 is fixed , and the data to be inverted comprises the set of all possible couplings leading to a radial eigenstate with this given energy , along with certain scattering data . in geometric spectral inversion ,",
    "we simply use one spectral curve , say @xmath29 progress has been reported on this problem in a sequence of earlier papers @xcite . from the point of view of problems in @xmath30 dimension , we were at first concerned that for excited states , which often only exist for @xmath3 sufficiently large , some essential pre - image data might be ` missing ' .",
    "however , the analytical inversion of the wkb approximation @xcite showed that the wkb inversion process improves in quality as one goes to higher states , and is moreover asymptotically exact .",

    "we suggest two areas of application for the form of spectral inversion @xmath34 which is the main topic of this paper .",

    ", quantum field theory can be used to predict the dependence @xmath0 of the energy of a two - body bound system on the coupling @xmath3 . geometric spectral inversion",
    "could then be used to construct from @xmath6 a potential @xmath5 that would reproduce the same spectrum in a quantum - mechanical model .",
    "the idea is that instead of fitting the parameters in an appropriate potential model , we instead develop an inversion method that allows us to reconstruct the potential shape directly from an eigenvalue curve .    in the present paper",
    "we study the inversion of spectral data arising from singular potentials .",
    "we develop a functional inversion algorithm based on envelope theory , a geometrical theory of energy functions such as @xmath36 this was first introduced @xcite in 1980 as a method for finding energy bounds for many - body problems , and has since led to a number of refinements and applications @xcite , including semirelativistic problems @xcite . in sections",

    "another form of expression , useful for our present task , is obtained if we change the kinetic - energy parameter from @xmath56 to @xmath78 itself by inverting the ( monotone ) function @xmath53 to define the associated @xmath79-function by @xmath80}(r ) = s = \\left(\\bar{f}^{-1}\\circ f\\right)(r).\\ ] ] now the energy formula eq.([efroms ] ) becomes @xmath81}(r )   + vf(r)\\right].\\ ] ] a sleight of hand may be perceived here since @xmath79 depends on @xmath82 .",

    "this is a consequence of jensen s inequality @xcite , which may be expressed in our context by the following : @xmath123 more specifically , we have for the kinetic potentials @xmath124 we can summarize these results by writing @xmath125 and remembering that @xmath126 is an inequality whenever @xmath117 has definite convexity .",

    "it remains here for us to describe another equivalent but geometrical approach which originally led , without jensen s inequality , to the term ` envelope method ' .",
    "this alternative is particularly useful when , as for the dirac equation @xcite , the kinetic - potential apparatus turns out to be complicated .",
    "we study potentials of the form @xmath118 and we suppose that an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath120 is known and is given by @xmath130 we now consider the ` tangential potentials ' given by @xmath131 where the coefficients are @xmath132 thus the original potential @xmath5 is the envelope of the family of tangential potentials @xmath133 .",
