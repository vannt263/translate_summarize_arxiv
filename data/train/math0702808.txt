    "i.e.  the position of a nonexcedance  we would have @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",

    "therefore if we want to insert @xmath85 empty rows into @xmath79 such that the resulting permutation is alternating , then our only choice is to use the algorithm described in the definition of @xmath102 .",
    "therefore @xmath13 is an injection .",
    "finally it remains to show that the permutation corresponding to @xmath105 is alternating .",
    "consider two consecutive rows of lengths @xmath77 and @xmath135 in @xmath79 , and suppose that the vertical column labels corresponding to these rows are @xmath125 and @xmath8 .",
    "we will show that the entries of the corresponding permutation from positions @xmath125 to @xmath8 are alternating .",
