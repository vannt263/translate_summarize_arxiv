    "although gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were discovered more then thirty years ago @xcite , their origin is still unclear .",
    "the most extensive data on the detection of grbs have been obtained by the compton gamma ray observatory batse experiment @xcite .",
    "analysis of the grbs detected showed that their apparent distribution on the sky was isotropic , but that there was a significant departure of their ( logn  logs ) curve from the @xmath1 , low corresponding to a spatially uniform source distribution @xcite .",
    "observation of optical afterglows of grb , following after identification of grb with a transient x - ray source by beppo - sax , and discovery of large ( up to @xmath2 ) redshifts in the spectra of optical transients had confirmed the cosmological origin of long grb .",
    "the cosmological model suggests that the grb source are located in distant galaxies ( within @xmath3 mpc ) . in the framework of this model , the observed fluxes @xmath4 erg s@xmath5",
    "require the release of enormous amounts of energy ( @xmath6 erg ) within a fairly short time interval ( of the order of several tens of seconds ) .",
    "such a powerful energy release should have a strong effect on a large volume of matter around the parent galaxy and should give rise to the formation of grb counterpart at other wavelengths . without specifying the mechanism for grb formation ,",
    "we assume only the existence of a strong flux gamma radiation and consider the interaction of this radiation with the interstellar medium on large spatial and temporal scales .",
    "we investigate the response of an interstellar medium of standard chemical composition to the passage of a short - term powerful pulse of gamma radiation ( that is , the dynamical behaviour and radiative cooling after heating by the gamma rays ) .",
    "the spherical symmetric model was investigated by bisnovatyi - kogan and timokhin ( 1997 ) , 2d model , permitting to study different matter distribution and reaction to anizotropic grb had been studied by barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004a , 2004b ) using numerical simulations by ppm method . in what follows",
    "we represent the results from barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "we solve the system of hydrodynamic equations , describing the motion of matter , together with thermal processes in axially symmetric case    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are density , pressure , internal specific energy and two velocity components , respectively .",
    "the gamma ray pulse is considered as instant one having total energy @xmath13 and luminosity @xmath14    we are interested in the behaviour of the gas heated by grb , which is taken as fully ionized one .",
    "consider flat spectrum of grb    @xmath15    the main grb photons have energies larger then ionization energies of most electrons , so we consider energy exchange of grb with the gas due to compton and inverse compton processes only .",
    "the function @xmath16 in ( [ uog3 ] ) is written us @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 we have used grb spectra with @xmath20 mev and 2 mev .",
    "the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which take into account deviations from thomson cross section @xmath23 due to klein - nishina correction ( @xmath24 ) , are taken from ( beloborodov and illarionov , 1995 ) .",
    "they are normalized so that @xmath25 at @xmath26 . in our cases @xmath27 for @xmath28 mev , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 mev .    the radiation force due to electron scattering is written as @xmath31 where the function @xmath32 takes into account kn corrections , @xmath33 for @xmath20 mev and @xmath34 for @xmath35 mev .",
    "cooling of the gas is due to different radiative processes ( ff , fb , bb ) . for optically thin plasma , which is used for description of cooling , the function @xmath36 was calculated in kirienko ( 1993 ) , raymond , cox and smith ( 1976 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 from kirienko ( 1993 ) was approximated analytically with a precision not worse then 5% @xmath39 it was shown in barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004a ) that the heat conductivity may be neglected in this problem .",
    "in the paper of barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004b ) more then 10 variants with different density distribution and grb beaming have been calculated . here",
    "we represent the main results of these calculations .",
    "pc , concentration @xmath40 cm@xmath5 , @xmath42 erg , @xmath43 mev ; curves marked by number correspond to the following time moments after grb : 1 ) 0.76 year , 2 ) 1.054 year , 3 ) 1.103 year , 4 ) 1.30 year , 5 ) 2.40 year.,width=336 ]    in the fig .",
    "1 from barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004b ) the evolution of temperature distribution in the cloud with time is represented for the grb exploding in the center of a spherically symmetric uniform cloud with a radius @xmath44 pc , concentration @xmath40 cm@xmath5 , @xmath42 erg , @xmath43 mev .",
    "it was shown by barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004b ) , that for @xmath43 mev , the heating at big distance from grb ( @xmath45 pc ) depends only on the grb energy @xmath13 and does not depend on @xmath46 .",
    "the temperature inversion is developed in the middle radiuses ( @xmath47 pc ) , where after heating @xmath48 k , and the cooling is the most effective .",
    "the cooling front is propagating outward with superlight speed , and inward with sublight speed ( phase velocities ) .",
    "the light curve for optical and ultraviolet luminosity , observed by the distant observer is represented in fig . 2 from barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004b ) .",
    "grb heating of the cloud is most intensive in central parts and leads to formation of the shock wave propagating outwards .",
    "the speed of the shock is about @xmath49 cm / s for the uniform spherical cloud , what is much less then the light speed .",
    "therefore , the cloud is heated mainly by the light signal from grb , and effects connected with the formation of central shock do not influence the integral light curve , except the radiation in the hard x - ray band produced in close vicinity of grb explosion .    in the case , when grb explosion takes place between two dence clouds , or in the cavity , produced by strong anizotropic stellar wind , the hydrodynamic effects may be much stronger then in the case of the uniform cloud , and the speed of the shock increase upto @xmath50 cm / s .        in the fig .",
    "3 from barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004a ) the evolution of the velocity field is represented for the case of the density distribution in the cloud as @xmath51@xmath52 , cloud radius 1.5 pc , for the energy of isotropic grb @xmath53 erg , and @xmath54 mev .",
    "the calculation have been performed in the region @xmath55 , with the condition @xmath56 on the boundaries .",
    "the temperature of the heated gas depend only on the distance from grb , so pressure gradient is developed inside the cavity inducing the motion of the matter to the axis of the cone .",
    "collision of the flow at the cone axis produces a cumulative effect , leading to matter acceleration along the axis up to velocity @xmath50 cm / s barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004a ) .    the accelerated matter in this case have a form of the bullet . in the case of the explosion in the space between two spherical clouds , the ejected matter should have the form of an expanding ring .",
    "radian , case b ) ; by the angle @xmath57 radian , case c ) ; by the angle @xmath58 radian , case d).,width=336 ]    in the case of anizotropic grb exploded in the uniform gas cloud the observed light curve is different for distant observer with different angular distances from the symmetry axes .",
    "such light curves are represented in fig 4 . from barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004b ) . here",
    "anizotropic grb is considered with angular dependence of luminosity @xmath59 , @xmath60 rad , the total energy of grb @xmath61 erg , density distribution @xmath62 @xmath52 , @xmath63 pc , when the explosion take place at the distance 1 pc from the center of the cloud .",
    "the shortest optical burst of few days with largest luminosity @xmath64 erg / s is seen by the observer , situated at the symmetry axis on the continuation of the line cloud center  grb .",
    "the observer on the line which is perpendicular to the symmetry axis is observing much longer optical afterglow ( @xmath65 days ) , but with accordingly lower luminosity .",
    "all these differences are connected with the kinematic of the light propagation from the nonuniformly and nonsimultaneously heated gas cloud .",
    "optical afterglow , connected with the reradiation of the grb by the dense enough molecular cloud could be observed as optical transient .",
    "indications that grb explosions take place in the region of star formation filled with dense gas clouds @xcite make this possibility as very probable .",
    "observation of plato in the optical afterglow of grb 030329 during a month between 64 and 94 days after grb detection @xcite may be connected with such kind of reradiation .",
    "the dense molecular clouds have very low temperature , at which dust is formed .",
    "estimations made by barkov and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004b ) show , that dust is evaporated by grb pulse in the cloud near grb impulse direction , or in the whole cloud by isotropic grb with @xmath66 pc , and does not influence the light curve of optical , uv and x - ray grb afterglows ."
