    "<S> we have used the wide field spectrograph on the australian national university 2.3-m telescope to perform the integral field spectroscopy for a sample of the galactic planetary nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> the spatially resolved velocity distributions of the h@xmath0 emission line were used to determine the kinematic features and nebular orientations . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that some bulge planetary nebulae toward the galactic center have a particular orientation .    </S>",
    "<S> the majority of planetary nebulae ( pne ) show predominantly axisymmetric morphologies , i.e. elliptical and bipolar . </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong argument in favor of the axisymmetric morphologies of pne being related to the angular momentum of their central engines ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> recently , it has been found that the nebular inclinations are closely related to the orbital inclinations of their close - binary central stars ( see e.g. , ( * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> pn as a test particle can be used to trace the dynamics of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the major axes of bipolar pne are assumed to be perfectly aligned with the angular momentum vectors of their central stars , so a population of bipolar galactic pne can be used to determine the angular momentum distribution of the local stars within the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies showed that some bipolar pne within the bulge near the galactic center have a homogeneous orientation ( ( * ? ? ? * weidmann & daz 2008 ) ; ( * ? ? </S>",
