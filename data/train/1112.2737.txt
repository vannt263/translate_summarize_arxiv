    "the history of star formation and chemical enrichment of galaxies is encoded in the ages and chemical compositions of their stellar populations . in particular ,",
    "powerful insights on the processes leading to the assembly of the galactic halo are gained by studies of the chemical abundances of their constituent populations of field stars and globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "it is only natural to extend such studies to the nearest giant spiral galaxy , m  31 .",
    "while detailed abundances of individual stars in the galactic halo , disk , and bulge , have been obtained and extensively analyzed in the past several decades , similar studies of comparable samples of m  31 halo stars await the advent of 20 - 30  m class telescopes , equipped with efficient high - resolution spectrographs . in the meantime ,",
    "integrated light studies of m  31 gcs have historically provided valuable qualitative information about the chemical composition of the halo of m  31 , leading to important clues on its formation history . as stellar population synthesis models and instruments both grow in sophistication , quantitative information on elemental abundances from integrated - light studies of m  31 gcs is also becoming available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the history of this field has been punctuated by heroic observational efforts , based on optical spectra painstakingly collected with , according to today s standards , relatively small telescopes , rather inefficient spectrographs , and low - quantum efficiency ( and often difficult to calibrate ) detectors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main results emerging from these efforts are : 1 ) m  31 gcs are on average slightly more metal rich than their galactic counterparts , while spanning roughly the same range of metallicities @xcite ; 2 ) m  31 gcs are @xmath0-enhanced , just like those in the mw ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) ; 3 ) m  31 gcs are cn - enhanced compared to mw gcs @xcite . in particular , @xcite found that the cn band at @xmath1 4170 @xmath2 is stronger by @xmath3 0.05 mag in the spectra of moderately metal - poor m31 gcs than in those of their mw counterparts of same metallicity ; and 4 ) m  31 gcs are possibly younger / older than those in the mw .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath4 is stronger in the spectra of m  31 gcs than in those of their mw counterparts by about 0.5 @xmath2 , indicating a younger age or differences in horizontal branch morphology .",
    "the latter two results are contradicted by the findings presented in this paper . while @xcite discuss the balmer line strengths in the spectra of the two gc systems , comparing their ages",
    ", cn is the main focus of this paper .",
    "those significant conclusions may teach us about important aspects of the formation of the two galaxies .",
    "for instance , the comparable mean metallicities may be indicative of similar overall chemical enrichment , suggesting that the early star formation efficiency has been similar in the two systems  or perhaps in the sub - components that eventually assembled to form them .",
    "the similar @xmath0-enhancement , assessed by measurements of mg and fe - sensitive absorption lines , suggests that either the time scale for star formation , the imf , or a combination thereof , were similar in both galaxies . the difference in cn strength , which has been ascribed to a difference in nitrogen abundance , is difficult to interpret , owing mostly to uncertainties in the models for the nucleosynthesis of that element .",
    "the issue is further complicated by the fact that cno elements are seen to present strong star - to - star variations in galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which may be associated with the presence of multiple stellar populations in those gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and by inference , in their m  31 counterparts .",
    "regardless , any scenario for the formation of the mw and m  31 haloes , and their gc systems , will be challenged by the large nitrogen abundance differences between systems that look otherwise very similar .",
    "this is the fourth of a series of papers dedicated to analyzing the kinematics and chemistry of a large sample of m  31 gcs , based on high - quality integrated spectra for several hundred m  31 clusters , obtained with mmt / hectospec . in paper",
    "i @xcite we characterized the population of young ( @xmath5 2 gyr ) m  31 clusters in terms of their ages , metallicities , masses , and kinematics . in paper",
    "ii @xcite , the ages and metallicities of m  31 old gcs were studied . in particular , we found no differences between the ages of the two old gc systems , in disagreement with previous claims .",
    "moreover , we found that the m  31 gc system does not have a bimodal metallicity distribution , in agreement with recent findings @xcite . in paper iii @xcite",
    ", we suggest that the old bulge gcs in m  31 are characterized by a bar - like kinematics .    in this paper , we present absorption line indices measured in integrated spectra of a large sample of m  31 and mw gcs .",
    "the data for m  31 gcs come from spectra described by @xcite , and those for mw gcs are based on the integrated gc spectra from @xcite .",
    "while the focus of this paper is on the comparison of cn strengths between the two gc systems , @xcite will present an analysis of abundance ratios , based on application of stellar population synthesis models to these index measurements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ data ] , the measurement of lick absorption line indices is described , and a comparison between cn indices in m  31 and mw gcs is presented in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ epilogue ] .",
    "a detailed description of our data , including sample selection , observation and reduction procedures , is presented in @xcite and @xcite for the mw and m  31 gcs , respectively .",
    "various aspects that are relevant to this work are summarized below .",
    "the m  31 gc spectra were obtained using the multi - fiber spectrograph hectospec @xcite , attached to the 6.5  m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) .",
    "the projected diameter of a hectospec fiber on the sky is 1@xmath6.5 , and the spectral coverage of the resulting 1-d , wavelength - calibrated spectra , is 36509200 @xmath2 .",
    "spectral dispersion , and resolution are 1.2 @xmath7 pixel@xmath8 and 5@xmath2 , respectively , and the median s / n of the spectra is 75 pixel@xmath8 . the normal operating procedure with hectospec , and other multi - fiber spectrographs , is to assign a number of fibers to blank sky areas in the focal plane , and then combine those in some fashion to allow sky subtraction of the target spectra .",
    "these methods are satisfactory for our outer m  31 fields , but not for the bulge areas where the local background is high relative to the cluster targets ( and where the most metal - rich clusters reside , along with many metal - poor clusters ) .",
    "as described in paper ii , for the bulge clusters only sky spectra far from the bulge of m31 were used . a separate offset exposure for such fields , taken concurrently and about 5@xmath6 offset from the targets , was reduced in a similar way ( so that contemporaneous sky subtraction was performed for on- and off - target exposures ) , and then these off - target local background spectra were subtracted from the on - target .",
    "relative flux calibration , aimed at removing the signatures of instrumental and atmospheric transmission , was achieved using observations of flux standards .",
    "the mw gc spectra were collected with the ctio blanco 4  m telescope , equipped with the ritchey - chrtien spectrograph , mounted at the telescope s cassegrain focus .",
    "given the extended nature of galactic gcs , observations were executed by drift scanning the targets with a 5@xmath9.5-long slit , over the range of @xmath10 one gc core radius , @xmath11 , taken from @xcite .",
    "additional exposures in areas surrounding the target gcs were obtained for background - subtraction purposes .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted by coadding the columns contained within a @xmath12 spatial window centered on the peak of each gc s light profile .",
    "therefore , for most gcs , the 1-d spectra sample a core radius - sized square spatial region ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for exceptions ) .",
    "no significant variations in lick index measurements were found between spectra that sample different spatial regions , for any of the 9 gcs for which such spectra were available .",
    "the spectra were wavelength - calibrated in the usual fashion .",
    "the resulting 1d wavelength - calibrated spectra cover the region between 3360 and 6430 @xmath2 , with a spectral dispersion of 1 @xmath2 pixel@xmath8 and a resolution of @xmath3 3.1 @xmath2 .",
    "relative flux calibration was achieved in the usual fashion , using observations of spectrophotometric standards .      even though the two sets of gc spectra were obtained with different instruments , and following rather different observational procedures",
    ", the measurement of line indices in the 1d spectra and their conversion from instrumental to standard system follows the same well established recipes that are only briefly described in this section .",
    "all line indices discussed in this paper were measured with the lick_ew code , which is part of the ez_agesgraves / ez_ages.html ] package @xcite .",
    "cluster spectra were first smoothed from their original resolution to the resolution of the lick index , system , given in table 1 of @xcite for each of the indices .",
    "the original resolution was 5@xmath2 in the case of the m  31 gcs , and that given in equation ( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "instrumental index measurements are based on the definitions provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "conversion between instrumental and standard lick indices was achieved in the usual fashion , through comparison with measurements taken in spectra of standard stars .",
    "observation of lick standards were obtained using the same instrumental setup used for gc observations , and the spectra reduced following the same procedures as adopted for gc spectra .",
    "likewise , the spectra of lick standards were smoothed to the lick resolution , and instrumental indices measured adopting the same definitions as above . for the m  31 hectospec data ,",
    "the six standards were observed through single fibers , though each star was observed through a different fiber .",
    "no significant star - to - star variation is seen in the residuals shown in figures  [ zm31a ] and [ zm31b ] , so we conclude that different fiber - to - fiber throughput variations contribute negligible uncertainties to our index measurements .",
    "we note that the tololo spectra are affected by a bad ccd column that runs across the spectra at a wavelength placed within the passband of the lick cn indices .",
    "we measured the effect of that bad column on our index measurements and found them to be affected at the @xmath3 0.015 mag level in the worst cases .",
    "moreover , the effect varies in sign and intensity from gc to gc , and thus should not introduce any significant systematic effect in our measurements .",
    "an important aspect of our conversion to the lick system is the adoption of standard index values from @xcite , rather than those of @xcite .",
    "we proceeded this way because of the higher accuracy of the @xcite indices . because they are based on flux - calibrated ccd spectra , they are free from the uncertainties associated with difficulties in calibrating data obtained with the lick image dissector scanner , upon which the @xcite indices are based . for more details , see discussion in @xcite , and particularly figures 1 and 2 of that paper .         continued .",
    "note that , except for a single very deviant measurement , residuals for cn indices are very small  in fact , much smaller than the @xmath3 0.05 mag cn differences measured by @xcite between mw and m  31 gcs .",
    "the very deviant point is due to star hd 78418 , which is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "it is not clear why it is not very deviant in other indices as well .",
    "comparison of the tololo spectrum for this star with that from @xcite suggests that there may be problems with flux calibration of the former , in the region of the cn indices . ]",
    "instrumental and standard lick indices are compared in figures  [ zeroa ] and [ zerob ] for the tololo data , and in figures  [ zm31a ] and [ zm31b ] for the hectospec data , where residuals are plotted as a function of index strength .",
    "error bars were calculated based on propagation of photon noise , readout noise , and sky - subtraction errors into index measurements , following @xcite . in the case of the tololo data , they are smaller than the symbol sizes , and are thus not plotted .",
    "the ids of the standard stars observed , as well as the instrumental measurements are provided in tables  [ std_m31a ] through [ std_mwb ] .",
    "the standard values were taken from @xcite , for the indices modeled in that paper .",
    "the residuals are in general small , and so are the zero point corrections for all indices in both sets of observations , which is a result of the data being based on flux calibrated , high - s / n spectra , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we note that , due mostly to unfavorable weather , we unfortunately were unable to collect data for a large number of lick standards , particularly during the observing run in cerro tololo , where the galactic gcs were observed . therefore ,",
    "as seen in those figures , the conversion to the standard lick system is sometimes based on a handful of data points , in most cases spanning an insufficient range of index strengths , resulting in somewhat uncertain , though small , zero point corrections .",
    "most importantly , for the purposes of this paper , we note that the residuals of the cn indices in both data sets are very small  indeed , much smaller than the 0.05 mag cn difference found by @xcite between the m  31 and mw gc systems .    for some indices",
    ", the data suggest the presence of a correlation of the residuals with index strength .",
    "that is the case of @xmath13 for the m  31 sample , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and fe4383 , in the case of the mw sample . despite the evidence for such trends ,",
    "we adopt single zero - point conversions for such indices , because the range spanned by the residual variations is relatively small .",
    "for instance , according to the @xcite models , the systematics introduced in [ c / fe ] determinations by adopting a constant zero - point conversion to @xmath13 is smaller than @xmath3 0.1 dex . by the same token ,",
    "uncertainties in [ fe / h ] due to zero point uncertainties in fe4383 are smaller than 0.1 dex , and those in the balmer lines translate into a mere @xmath3 1 gyr uncertainty in age , for old systems .",
    "the final zero points are thus estimated as the mean residual , excluding strongly deviant points .",
    "the paucity of data points makes it difficult to estimate the zero point uncertainties , and to be as fair as possible , we define these as 1/2 of the dynamic range of the residuals , or :    @xmath17    where strongly deviant points were removed from the statistics .",
    "this may be a fair representation of the uncertainties in indices that present a large scatter of the residuals ( e.g. , g4300 ) or showing an apparent trend of residuals with index strength ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and fe4383 ) , but it possibly underestimates the uncertainties for indices where little variation of the residuals is seen . however , the latter is presumably due to the indices being robust to instrumental effects , as is probably the case of @xmath4 and redder indices  see discussion and plots in @xcite and @xcite . the final zero point conversions to the lick system from @xcite and",
    "associated uncertainties are provided in tables  [ zeromw ] and  [ zerom31 ] .",
    "finally , we decided to include , for completeness , indices that were not modeled by @xcite , and for those they come from unpublished measurements taken on the spectra of the indo - us library @xcite , convolved to the lick / ids resolution ( see details in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "conversion of the instrumental indices into the indo - us system is provided in tables  [ convmw ] and [ convm31 ] for mw and m  31 gcs , respectively .",
    "conversion between indo - us values and the standard lick / ids system of @xcite , based on @xmath3 100 stars in common between the two spectral libraries , is provided in table  [ conv ]",
    ".         continued .",
    "note that , as in the case of the mw gcs , ( figure  [ zerob ] ) the cn residuals are much smaller than the 0.05 mag difference between m  31 and mw gcs , found by @xcite . ]",
    "the two systems of gcs are compared in index - index space in figures  [ inda]-[indc ] .",
    "we plot all indices against @xmath18fe@xmath19 , which is the average of the two lick indices fe5270 and fe5335 .",
    "@xcite showed that this combination of indices is a good indicator of [ fe / h ] , being only weakly sensitive to variations of other elemental abundances , and being only mildly sensitive to age and horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology . a relation between @xmath18fe@xmath19 and [ fe / h ]",
    "was derived by @xcite , on the basis of 31 galactic gcs with [ fe / h ] determinations from abundance analysis of high resolution spectra of individual gc member stars by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "iron abundances in the two latter papers were converted to the @xcite scale using the transformations provided in their appendix . that relation is used to plot an approximate [ fe / h ] scale on the top of the upper panels in figures  [ inda]-[indc ] . due to non - linearities in the @xmath18fe@xmath19[fe / h ] relation ,",
    "the [ fe / h ] scale in those plots is only approximate , but is useful to guide the eye . for clarity and accuracy , m  31 gcs for which",
    "the error in @xmath18fe@xmath19 is greater than 0.15 @xmath2 are excluded from the plots .",
    "this removes all young clusters from the m  31 sample , because the s / n of the spectra for these lower - mass , fainter clusters , is indeed on average lower than that of their older , more massive counterparts .",
    "most importantly , the absence of young and intermediate - age gcs in the m  31 sample means that age effects are , to first order , negligible in metal - index vs. metal - index plots in figures  [ inda]-[indc]though they may be detectable in plots involving balmer lines . in this way",
    ", we can perform a reliable model - free assessment of differences ( or lack thereof ) between the old m  31 and mw gcs in metallicity and abundance - ratio spaces .",
    "two sets of error bars are shown for each gc system in the upper / lower left corner of each panel .",
    "the upper set of error bars represents the average uncertainty in individual index measurements , as estimated by lick_ew , using the prescription from @xcite .",
    "the lower set of error bars represents the zero point uncertainties determined as described in section  [ absind ] .    before moving to the main focus of this paper , which is a comparison of the strengths of cn indices in m  31 and mw gcs",
    ", we briefly mention a few interesting features of figures  [ inda]-[indc ] .",
    "the first obvious feature is the systematic difference between the two gc samples in c@xmath20 , where m  31 gcs are systematically stronger by @xmath3 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "we note that the calibration of this index into the lick system is relatively uncertain , as indicated by the error bars on the top left panel of figure  [ indc ] , whose size is in fact comparable to the shift between the two samples . if taken at face value , this discrepancy could indicate a higher [ c / fe ] in m  31 gcs than in their mw counterparts . however , the data for the other carbon - sensitive index in this study , g4300 , are not consistent with that interpretation ( figure  [ indb ] ) . for [ fe / h ] @xmath5 1.2 , the two samples seem to have identical g4300 values , and for higher [ fe / h ] mw gcs actually have stronger g4300 than their m  31 counterparts .",
    "the latter is most likely not associated with a difference in [ c / fe ] , but rather with differences in age indicators between metal - rich mw and m  31 gcs , which are not completely understood ( see discussion in section  [ thecase ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the differences seen in c@xmath20 are probably a spurious effect due to uncertainties in the calibration of that index .",
    "this topic will be revisited in a forthcoming paper , where abundance ratios for both samples will be determined and analyzed .",
    "we finally point out that systematic differences between m  31 and mw gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath21 1.2 can be seen in figures  [ inda ] and [ indb ] in the strengths of their @xmath22 and @xmath23 indices .",
    "interestingly , no such systematics are seen in @xmath4 .",
    "a comparative analysis of balmer line strengths in the two gc samples is the topic of another forthcoming paper .",
    "fe@xmath19 is smaller than 0.15 @xmath2 are plotted .",
    "two sets of error bars are shown for each gc system in the upper / lower left corner of each panel .",
    "the upper set represents the average uncertainty in individual index measurements , as estimated by lick_ew , using the prescription from @xcite .",
    "the lower set represents the zero point uncertainties determined as described in section  [ absind ] .",
    "the average @xmath18fe@xmath19 index is a good indicator of [ fe / h ] , and a @xmath18fe@xmath19[fe / h ] relation derived by @xcite is used to establish the [ fe / h ] scale at the top of the upper panels . that relation is strongly non - linear for [ fe / h]@xmath24 and [ fe / h]@xmath25 . within the uncertainties",
    ", there is no systematic difference between the two gc systems in either @xmath22 or cn indices  certainly nothing as high as 0.05 mag , as found by @xcite .",
    "the arrows in the lower right of the bottom panels indicate the size of the effect found by @xcite .",
    "the exceptions are the two most metal - rich mw gcs , ngc  6528 and 6553 ( where the former is represented by the two highest @xmath18fe@xmath19 data points  see text ) .",
    "these gcs are systematically weaker in cn and stronger in h@xmath26 , than m  31 gcs of the same [ fe / h]see discussion in text . ]     for another set of line indices .",
    "again , no significant differences between the two gc systems in index - index space is found , again , with the exception of ngc  6528 and 6553 , which are too strong in @xmath23 and too weak in g4300 , compared to m  31 gcs of the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "a few mw clusters seem to deviate from the trends established by the remaining galactic objects  see discussion in text . ]     for another set of line indices .",
    "no significant difference between the two gc systems is detected in @xmath4 or mg indices .",
    "there is a hint that @xmath13 may be stronger in m  31 gcs than in their mw counterparts of same [ fe / h ] , which would be indicative of a higher carbon abundance in m  31 gcs .",
    "however , the difference is not larger than the zero - point uncertainty for this index , which is particularly large for both data sets . unlike in the case of the bluer lick indices ,",
    "the two metal - rich mw gcs do not differ from their m  31 counterparts in any of the indices displayed here . ]",
    "we focus on the bottom panels of figure  [ inda ] , which compare the two gc samples in @xmath18fe@xmath19-cn space .",
    "note that the two cn indices displayed in this figure behave in exactly the same way .",
    "this is because these indices measure the same spectral feature , which is a combination of @xmath27 = 0 and 1 vibrational bands of the cn violet electronic transition ( @xmath28 ) , spreading roughly between 4100 and 4220 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the only difference between the two indices is in the blue pseudocontinuum , which in the case of the @xmath29 index is slightly narrower .",
    "because our results are independent of which of the two indices is used , we throughout this paper sometimes refer to _ cn indices _ as both @xmath30 and @xmath29 lick indices .",
    "in this section , we concentrate our attention on gcs more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0.4 , leaving the discussion of the more metal - rich gcs for section  [ thecase ] .",
    "the most obvious feature in these plots is the slight difference between the two gc samples in cn strength .",
    "we find an average cn difference between m  31 and mw gcs of about 0.01 mag , which is the same size as the zero - point uncertainties in both sets of measurements .",
    "this difference is also 1/5 of what was found by @xcite ( indicated by arrows in the lower right of the bottom panels ) . in other words ,",
    "spectra of mw and m  31 gcs of the same @xmath18fe@xmath19 ( same [ fe / h ] ) seem to have essentially the same cn strength ( we discuss the deviant , high - metallicity , mw gcs below ) .",
    "this is in disagreement with the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who measured the same indices in smaller samples of lower s / n spectra , finding evidence for a difference between the two gc systems , in that m  31 gcs have stronger cn than their mw counterparts by about 0.05 mag .",
    "similar cn differences between mw and m  31 gcs were also suggested by @xcite , who measured the strengths of the same cn bands studied in this paper , in a sample consisting of tens of m  31 and mw gcs .",
    "similar differences were also found by @xcite , who measured the strength of cn bands in nir spectra of four m  31 gcs . because no difference was found between the two gc systems in a carbon - sensitive index ( the g band ) , the above authors suggested that the cn differences were probably due to m  31 gcs having higher nitrogen abundances than their mw counterparts .",
    "just how much higher should the [ n / fe ] values be in m  31 than in mw gcs was not known , as such an estimate required models that were then unavailable .",
    "nevertheless , that suggestion was later bolstered by measurements of the near - uv nh band at 3360@xmath2 by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite found nh3360 to be stronger in m  31 than in mw gcs by over @xmath3 2 @xmath2 ( see discussion in section  [ nhuv ] ) .",
    "our result is then rather surprising , in view of the relatively large body of counter - evidence summarized above , which led to the ( far - reaching ) conclusion that m  31 and mw gcs have different nitrogen abundances . considering the significance of the zero point uncertainties discussed in section  [ absind ]",
    ", we decided to take advantage of the high s / n of our data to inspect visually the spectra of m  31 and mw gcs . that required selecting gcs with the same [ fe / h ] and same combination of age and hb morphology .",
    "we proceeded as follows .",
    "we first selected four mw gcs spanning a wide range of metallicities for the comparison : ngc  2298 , ngc  1851 , 47  tuc , and ngc  6528 , with [ fe / h ] = -1.96 , -1,18 , -0.76 , and + 0.07 @xcite .",
    "next , we looked for m  31 gcs with similar parameters .",
    "the search is illustrated in figure  [ lookalike ] , where data for those four gcs are overplotted on top of m  31 gc measurements in the @xmath18fe@xmath31 plane .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that these indices are chiefly sensitive to [ fe / h ] , age , and hb morphology . therefore , selecting m  31 gcs with similar @xmath18fe@xmath19 and @xmath4 , one should obtain a sample with [ fe / h ] and age / hb - morphology that is similar to those of the four mw gcs of choice .",
    "the boxes surrounding the latter four data points illustrate our selection of four sub - samples of gcs which are the counterparts of ngc  2298 , ngc  1851 , 47  tuc , and ngc  6528 in m  31 , according to that ( limited ) set of stellar population parameters .",
    "clusters with low s / n spectra or unusual - looking spectral shapes ( indicative of uncertain flux - calibration ) were removed from the sub - samples .",
    "the ids of the gcs selected for each metallicity bin are listed in table  [ lookalikes ] .",
    "intercomparison of these spectra should reveal any cn differences that may be masked by zero - point uncertainties in our lick index measurements .",
    "very high s / n stacked spectra of m  31 gcs within each of the four metallicity groups were generated , which are compared with those of their mw counterparts in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the latter spectra were smoothed to match the lower resolution of the m  31 gcs spectra . in all panels ,",
    "the wavelengths of the pseudocontinuum and passband windows defining the lick @xmath30 index are indicated as horizontal bars , and @xmath30 measurements taken on these spectra are shown in the lower - right corner of each panel .",
    "another bar towards shorter wavelengths indicates the approximate span of the ( stronger ) violet cn bands , which go from roughly 3840 to 3890 @xmath2 @xcite    .",
    "the boxes surrounding the mw gc data points represent the index bounds for the search of similar gcs in m  31 .",
    "those m  31 gcs that fall inside each search box are deemed similar to their mw counterparts in terms of [ fe / h ] and a combination of age and hb morphology .",
    "the spectra of these m  31 gcs are stacked and compared with their mw counterparts , as shown in subsequent figures . ]    .",
    "mw gcs are plotted in black , m  31 gcs in gray .",
    "each spectrum was multiplied by a constant , so that the average flux within the red pseudocontinuum of the lick cn index are approximately the same .",

    "we first focus on the spectra of ngc  2298 , ngc  1851 , and 47  tuc , leaving the discussion of ngc  6528 to section  [ thecase ] .",
    "the spectra of these three clusters are remarkably similar to those of their m  31 counterparts , except for slight slope differences , which can be ascribed to uncertainties in flux calibration and reddening .",
    "there are also small differences in the strengths of ca hk and higher order balmer lines , which may be due to a combination of sky - subtraction uncertainties and genuine differences in the relative numbers of the hottest stars and their temperature distributions ( a topic that is further discussed in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "however , in confirmation of our conclusions from figure  [ inda ] , there are _ no differences _ in cn strengths between these two sets of spectra , either in the 4170 @xmath30 band , or in the violet cn band .",
    "the latter is particularly important because the violet cn band is more sensitive than its blue counterpart to variations of cn concentration in stellar atmospheres , further reinforcing the notion that there are no differences in cn strengths between m  31 and mw gcs . for ngc  2298 ,",
    "ngc  1851 , and their m  31 counterparts , the spectral shape and the strengths of the lines included in the bandpass of the @xmath30 index suggest that blue cn lines are indeed very weak , if not altogether absent , from the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we suggest that any differences between m  31 and mw spectra in this low metallicity regime can not be ascribed to differences in cn strength ( the 0.014 mag difference measured in @xmath30 between ngc  2298 and its m  31 counterparts is mostly due to the blip in the spectrum of ngc  2298 , which is associated with a bad ccd column , as discussed in section  [ absind ] ) .",
    "these comparisons also suggest that zero - point uncertainties in @xmath30 measurements are negligible .",
    "having found no compelling reasons in our own data to conclude that there is any significant cn - strength difference between m  31 and mw gcs , we examine other data sets published in the literature , in an attempt to understand the contrast between our results and those from other studies .",

    "the first concerns the sampling of the extended gc spatial distributions . while @xcite drift - scanned the target gcs within their core radii",
    ", @xcite chose instead to take a number of exposures with the slit placed at different positions on the gcs .",
    "the second regards sky subtraction . @xcite",
    "scanned regions of sky around the gcs generating 1d background spectra which they subtracted from the gc extracted 1d spectra .",
    "@xcite followed two different procedures . on one hand ,",
    "like @xcite , they subtracted 1d background spectra from their extracted cluster spectra ( background `` modeling '' ) . on the other they used narrow windows at the slit ends to sample the sky background , subtracting it in the process of extracting the 1d spectrum ( background `` extraction '' ) .",
    "they argue that background `` modeling '' yields unreliable results , because it is difficult to model the light around the clusters , mostly due to superposition of different stellar populations , and reddening variations at 1.5@xmath9 scales .",
    "the @xcite m  31 gc data were obtained by @xcite using the wide field fibre optic spectrograph on the 4 m william herschel telescope at la palma , canary islands .",

    "the mw gcs seem to occupy the lower envelope of the distribution of m  31 gcs in the [ mgfe] vs. @xmath29 plane .",
    "however , since there are no differences in the @xmath18fe@xmath19 vs. @xmath29 plane , this mismatch is likely to be due to mg @xmath33 differences between the two gc systems in the data by puzia and collaborators , and _ not _ in their cn strengths .",
    "the latter suspicion is confirmed by figure  [ puziamgfe ] , where mg @xmath33 and @xmath18fe@xmath19 from @xcite and @xcite are compared .",
    "the mw data are systematically stronger in mg @xmath33 for fixed @xmath18fe@xmath19 than m  31 data , by about 0.5 @xmath2 . following a suggestion by the anonymous referee , we generated plots similar to figure  [ puziamgfe ] , replacing @xmath18fe@xmath19 by other fe indices , such as fe4383 , fe4531 , fe5406 , and fe5709 , and mg @xmath33 by mg@xmath34 , and the same result is obtained : mw clusters are systematically stronger than their m  31 counterparts in mg indices at fixed fe , which suggests that the difference is due to mg @xmath33 being stronger , and not @xmath18fe@xmath19 being weaker , in mw clusters .",
    "we note that no such difference is found in our data between mw and m  31 ( figure  [ indc ] ) , so we do not understand the origin of this discrepancy in the data by puzia and collaborators . comparing mg @xmath33 for mw clusters in common between @xcite and @xcite",

    "incidentally , we also found the @xmath30 and @xmath29 values in @xcite m  31 gc data to be systematically stronger than our own values by @xmath38 mag , which may also be partly responsible for their results .",

    "close inspection of other data sets also confirm our results .",

    "figure  [ burstdata ] shows the data from @xcite for the nh 3360 and mg@xmath34 indices .",
    "the left panel is a reproduction of the top panel of their figure 7 , which suggests that the nh 3360 band is much stronger in m  31 gcs than in their mw counterparts .",
    "the mean indices for the bulk of the mw sample in @xcite are mg@xmath34 @xmath3 0.06 mag , and nh 3360 @xmath3 3.5 @xmath2 ( excluding m  71 , the gc with highest metallicity in that sample ) . clusters in m  31 with comparable mg@xmath34 strength have nh 3360 @xmath3 6 @xmath2 , which is almost a factor of 2 stronger than their mw counterparts .",
    "we compared the mg@xmath34 measurements in @xcite with our numbers for gcs in common in the two studies . from 14 m  31 gcs in common between this work and @xcite , we determine a mean mg@xmath34 difference of    @xmath39    the anonymous referee pointed out to us that a systematic difference exists between the @xcite mg@xmath34 data for m  31 gcs and those by @xcite , which is consistent with these numbers .    for the mw sample , there are unfortunately only 3 gcs in common between the two studies : ngc  5904 , 7078 , and 7089 , so zero point differences can not be determined as robustly .",
    "nevertheless , the differences between mg@xmath34 measurements from @xcite and this work , in the same sense as above , for these three gcs , are : 0.0089 , 0.0062 , and 0.0038 mag , respectively .",
    "these are an order of magnitude smaller than the zero - point differences for the m  31 sample , and in fact are comparable to our zero point uncertainty from equation  [ zpt ] .",
    "we apply these zero point corrections to the @xcite mg@xmath34 data , and redisplay them on the right panel of figure  [ burstdata ] .",
    "one can see from this figure that most of the difference between the two samples disappears once the @xcite mg@xmath34 indices are brought into consistency with our values .",
    "this analysis therefore suggests that most of the apparent discrepancy between nh 3360 measurements in m  31 and mw gcs is in fact due to uncertainties in the calibration of mg@xmath34 measurements to a common system , and _ not _ to a real difference in nh strengths .    .",

    "this plot suggests that there may be problems with the zero - points of mg@xmath34 indices in @xcite data , and when this effect is removed , they are in fact consistent with similar nh strengths in mw and m  31 gcs . ]",
    "that there might be issues with the calibration of the mg@xmath34 index into the lick system is not entirely implausible , since this index is measured on a wide baseline , being thus susceptible to uncertainties in flux calibration .",

    "instrumental magnitudes were converted to the lick system using observations of standard stars , in the usual way .",
    "we do not find any obvious way in which the calibration of mg@xmath34 measurements in @xcite data may be faulty . by the same token",
    ", the calibration of our own measurements for that index into the lick system seems to be quite robust ( upper panel of figure  [ zm31b ] ) .",
    "however , an issue indeed seems to be present with the @xcite mg@xmath34 indices for m  31 gcs .",
    "this is further illustrated by figure  [ mg2feh ] , where mg@xmath34 measurements from different sources for m  31 and mw gcs are plotted against [ fe / h ] .",
    "iron abundances for the m  31 gcs were obtained by @xcite as described in section  [ analysis ] . for mw gcs ,",

    "clusters in m  31 and the mw are expected to occupy the same locus in this diagram , provided they have similar [ mg / fe ] , which is the case , as demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , and figure  [ indb ] . as can be seen ,",

    "all the data for both m  31 and mw gcs occupy the same locus in this plane , except for the @xcite data for m  31 clusters , suggesting that there indeed is a zero - point offset for this index in @xcite data . ]",
    "we conclude that the nh 3360 feature has similar strength in the spectra of m  31 and mw gcs of the same metallicity .",
    "we suggest that the assertion that it may be stronger in the spectra of m  31 gcs derived from a zero point offset in mg@xmath34 measurements in @xcite .",
    "m  31 and mw gcs of different metallicities were compared in the nh vs mg@xmath34 plane , which led to a perception that nh features seemed ( artificially ) stronger in m  31 than in mw gcs .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the data do not require m  31 gcs to have enhanced n abundances , relative to their mw counterparts of same metallicity .",
    "in retrospect , this is not surprising .",
    "looking carefully at the original data by @xcite and @xcite , one notices that the bulk of the difference between the two samples happens in the low metallicity regime .",
    "for instance , looking at figure 5l in @xcite , one finds that cn differences between m  31 and mw gcs happen for gcs with mg@xmath40 , which , according to figure  [ mg2feh ] , corresponds to [ fe / h ] @xmath5 1.0the same actually applies to the @xcite data .",
    "recall that we concluded , in our discussion of gc blue spectra from section  [ fecn ] ( figure  [ spectra ] ) , that cn 4170 is hardly present in gcs with such low metallicities , suggesting that the measured differences may be associated with uncertainties in the calibration of the cn and/or mg indices .",
    "we also examine the claim by @xcite that cn is enhanced in m  31 gcs .",
    "@xcite obtained high s / n integrated spectra of @xmath3 30 m  31 gcs with the lris spectrograph connected to the keck i telescope .",
    "the spectra were reduced following standard procedures , and the authors report flux calibration uncertainties of the order of 10% .",
    "indices were measured in m  31 gc spectra and converted to the lick system using observations of standard stars .",
    "these indices were compared with measurements taken on galactic spectra by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite shows very clearly that there are no differences in the lick cn@xmath34 index between m  31 and mw gcs of same metallicity .",
    "however , @xcite claim that instead there are differences in the cnb index , defined by @xcite , which measures the strength of the violet cn 3883 @xmath2 feature .",
    "figure 4 of @xcite suggests that this index is stronger in m  31 gcs than in their mw counterparts by as much as 0.1 mag . because this result is in disagreement with their own measurements of the lick cn indices , @xcite",
    "provide a comparison between two well observed spectra from the m  31 and the galaxy : those of 255 - 280 and ngc  6441 , respectively .",
    "this comparison , in the form of a ratio spectrum , is shown in their figure 5 , where residuals are seen at the positions of the lick cn@xmath34 and cnb indices , as well as the ca ii h and k lines .",
    "the latter residual is particularly strong .",
    "however , closer inspection of that figure shows that the `` feature '' in the ratio spectrum below @xmath3 4000 @xmath2 is very broad with fwhm @xmath3 200 @xmath2 , whereas the cn violet feature is certainly not broader than 100 @xmath2 ( see figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the difference may be instead due to some systematic flux calibration effect , rather than to a real difference in cn strength .",
    "this is further verified in figure  [ ratio ] , where the same ratio spectrum obtained with our own data for ngc  6441 and 225 - 280 ( gray lines ) is compared with the ratio between the spectra of ngc  6441 and the average spectrum of m  31 gcs with similar [ fe / h ] and age / hb - morphology as ngc  6441 ( black line ) .",
    "focusing first on the gray line , we note that our version of the ratio between the spectra of ngc  6441 and 225 - 280 is very different from that shown in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "the residual at the position of the cn violet band has a completely different shape than that shown in figure 5 of @xcite . while in our case",
    "the residual keeps a strong resemblance to the shape of the cn violet band , in @xcite it is indeed much broader and stronger , suggesting that it is very likely due to flux calibration and or sky - subtraction uncertainties .",
    "such uncertainties are not unusual at the blue end of the spectrum , which is often characterized by low s / n , due to a combination of low detector quantum efficiency , high atmospheric extinction and sky background , and the overall redness of the gcs .",
    "nevertheless , the fact remains that our ratio spectrum does show a strong residual at the position of both the violet and the lick cn bands .",
    "this is explained , however , by the fact that 225 - 280 is _ more metal - rich _ than ngc  6441 , as indicated by the presence of strong residuals for several other metal lines , such as ca4227 , g4300 , fe4383 ( indicated in figure  [ ratio ] ) , mg @xmath33 , fe5270 , fe5335 ( not shown ) and many others . running data for both gcs through ez_ages @xcite",
    ", we find that [ fe / h ] is approximately 0.2 dex higher in 225 - 280 than in ngc  6441 .",
    "therefore , it would not be at all unexpected that cn bands are stronger in 225 - 280 , even if the gc has the same abundance pattern than that of ngc  6441 . when the spectrum of ngc  6441 is divided by the average spectrum of gcs that are more similar in metallicity , all residuals are considerably smaller ( black line ) .",
    "comparison of the spectrum of ngc  6441 to those of some m  31 gcs with similar metallicity , such as 073 - 134 , 106 - 168 , and 383 - 318 , shows essentially no residuals at the positions of cn bands .",
    "we note that the average spectrum used to obtain the ratio displayed in figure  [ ratio ] includes gcs selected according to the following criteria : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the reason for using @xmath43 instead of @xmath4 has to do with the presence of blue horizontal - branch stars in ngc  6441 .",
    "this is going to be discussed in a lot more detail in a forthcoming paper .    as a final note , we call attention to the fact that there is a very strong residual in the caii h and k lines at 3968 and 3933 @xmath2 , respectively",
    ". we currently do not understand the origin of this substantial difference between m  31 and mw gcs . if real , this issue merits further scrutiny .",
    "see discussion in section  [ thecase ] .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the data by @xcite are also consistent with our finding , that there is no substantial difference between galactic and m  31 gcs in terms of their cn strengths .",
    "the conclusion by @xcite that the violet cn band indicates such differences is possibly the by - product of a mismatch between the metallicities of the gcs analyzed , combined with flux calibration uncertainties in the violet part of the spectrum , where s / n is lower and the sensitivity function as a function of wavelength in ccd - based optical spectrographs is steep .          based on the previous section , one concludes that there is no significant difference in cn strength between m  31 and mw gcs with @xmath44 \\simless -0.4 $ ] .",
    "the same can not be said about more metal - rich gcs , since the three data points at the high - metallicity end of the mw gc sample have substantially lower cn indices than their m  31 counterparts at the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "moreover , these three high-[fe / h ] mw points seem to depart significantly from the @xmath18fe@xmath19@xmath30 and @xmath18fe@xmath19@xmath29 trends established by the mw gcs alone , by being displaced towards low cn values .",
    "the two highest @xmath18fe@xmath19 points are from two spectra of ngc  6528 , obtained with different spatial extraction windows during data reduction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , whereas the third point comes from the spectrum of ngc  6553 ( a third metal - rich gc , ngc  5927 , also seems to be marginally too weak in cn ) .",
    "visual confirmation of this result is offered at the bottom panel of figure  [ spectra ] where the spectrum of ngc  6528 is compared to the average spectrum of its m  31 counterparts .",
    "cn bands seem to be stronger in the average m  31 gc spectrum than in that of ngc  6528 .",
    "moreover , all features bluer than 4000 @xmath2 , and particularly the caii h and k lines , are weaker in ngc  6528 .",
    "the gcs ngc  6553 and 6528 are also the two most metal - rich in the @xcite sample , and no such difference between these gcs and their m  31 counterparts is seen in their data ( figure  [ puziadata ] ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath30 index is stronger in the spectra of ngc  6528 and 6553 by 0.035 and 0.096 mag than in @xcite .",
    "one therefore is left wondering whether these differences may be due to different treatments of sky subtraction and spatial sampling adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us recall that ngc  6528 and 6553 are located towards the galactic bulge , in a region of the sky that is affected by strong background and foreground contamination , rendering the task of sky subtraction rather tricky and prone to large uncertainties .",
    "moreover , these gcs , and ngc  6553 in particular , are fairly sparse , making a fair representation of all stellar types contributing relevantly to the integrated light rather difficult , particularly for giant stars ( regardless of the strengths of cn bands in their spectra ) .",
    "a ratio between the spectra of ngc  6528 and its m  31 counterparts from table  [ lookalikes ] , displayed in figure  [ ratio_6528 ] ( gray line ) , shows the apparent signature of excess absorption in the regions of the violet and lick cn bands in spectra of m  31 gcs . in order to check whether sky subtraction errors can be responsible for the differences found , we generated a new ngc  6528 spectrum , where the sky subtraction was changed by multiplying the sky level by 20 .",
    "the ratio between ngc  6528 and that over - sky - subtracted spectrum is shown as a solid line .",
    "one can see that the spectra look somewhat similar , suggesting that sky - subtraction errors may be partly responsible for the discrepancies between metal - rich m  31 gcs and ngc  6528 .",
    "however , that would correspond to a huge error in sky subtraction at @xmath1 @xmath3 4000 @xmath2 , which is probably higher than the expected sky - background uncertainties .",
    "we note that , even in that case , the cn violet band in the ratio spectrum is poorly matched by the simulated ratio , leading to the conclusion that an even higher , and less likely , error in the sky subtraction is required to explain the cn differences between ngc  6528 and its m  31 counterparts .",
    "moreover , the ca hk line residuals in figure  [ ratio_6528 ] are very discrepant , suggesting that the difference in these lines can not be explained by sky subtraction errors alone .",
    "in addition to differences in sky - subtraction procedures , the @xcite spectra differ from those discussed in this work in the way that the gc stars are sampled ( section  [ pudata ] ) . while @xcite drift - scanned a long slit within the gc core radii , @xcite took a few spectra at fixed slit positions at varying radial distance from the gc center .",
    "therefore , differences in the way the two spectra sample the brightest gc stars can also lead to measurable differences , particularly in line indices that tend to be stronger in the spectra of giant stars .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that the stars that are subject to this kind of stochastic effect contribute little light in the blue part of the spectrum .",
    "finally , ngc  6528 and 6553 may possess an unusually high population of blue stars , particularly blue stragglers .",
    "we find this very unlikely , since the residuals between these gc spectra and their m  31 counterparts show no strong evidence for contamination by a star light .",
    "this result also argues against the presence of any important contamination by foreground a stars .    if nevertheless background subtraction errors , and stochastic effects , and hot stars in the foreground or in the gc are not to blame , and indeed the gcs differ in their chemical composition , it is not entirely clear whether the differences between galactic metal - rich clusters and their m  31 counterparts can be ascribed to cn - enhancement of the latter .",
    "the ratio spectrum suggests that there may be a slight metallicity difference between ngc  6528 and its m  31 counterparts selected on the basis of @xmath4 and @xmath18fe@xmath19 strengths , since residuals in other metal lines are also visible in figure  [ ratio_6528 ] , which may suggest the presence of differences between the two gc samples in abundance ratios other than [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to comment on the differences between the strengths of caii hk in m  31 and mwgc spectra .",
    "one can clearly see in comparisons of spectra in figure  [ spectra ] and in the ratio spectra showed in figures  [ ratio ] and [ ratio_6528 ] , that caii h and k lines are stronger in m  31 gc spectra than in those in the mw sample .",
    "the differences are more significant on the high metallicity end .",
    "the hypothesis that cn differences between ngc  6528 and 6553 and their counterparts in m  31 are due to sky - subtraction errors could possibly also account for these caii h and k differences .",
    "because they are so strong , the signal in the core of the line is fairly weak , and so these lines are particularly sensitive to errors in background subtraction . however , we note that a similar difference in caii hk strength is seen between the spectra of ngc  6441 and its m  31 counterparts by @xcite , on the basis of different datasets .",
    "we compared caii hk strengths measured in the hectospec spectra with those measured in spectra obtained with keck / lris by @xcite and found them to be consistent with each other , after accounting for the different instrumental resolutions .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the hectospec spectra are free of important systematic effects due to background subtraction . regarding the mw data ,",
    "the similarity in the strengths of the residuals in the ca h and k lines in the ratio spectra of figure  [ ratio_6528 ] suggests that there indeed may be a background subtraction problem with the spectra of these two metal - rich mw gcs , but that can not be the whole story , as the size of the sky - subtraction error required to explain the data is too large  and even in that case , it can not explain differences in the ca h and k lines .",
    "independent data would help solving this puzzle .    to summarize , we are not entirely convinced that ngc  6528 and 6553 indeed differ from their m  31 counterparts in terms of their carbon and nitrogen relative abundances , in spite of the fact that cn bands seem to be weaker in their spectra than in m  31 metal - rich gcs .",
    "it is possible that the differences are partly due to sky - subtraction uncertainties , but this requires errors that seem unreasonably high .",
    "the best way to approach this problem is through a study of cn strengths in statistically significant samples of resolved stars in those two bulge milky way gcs . @xcite",
    "have recently collected medium - resolution spectra of roughly a dozen individual stars in ngc  6528 and found a few of them to be cn - strong .",
    "whether that would translate into a cn - strong integrated spectrum or not , is a question that can only be answered on the basis of spectra of a much larger sample of gc members .",
    "we present absorption line index measurements taken in integrated spectra of a large number of m  31 and mw gcs , from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we discuss the conversion of instrumental measurements to a common equivalent system ( defined in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the uncertainties in the zero points of these systems .    by comparing measurements of cn indices in old gcs belonging to both data sets ,",
    "we conclude that , in disagreement with previous work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others , m  31 and mw gcs of the same [ fe / h ] _ generally _ have similar cn - band strengths .",
    "because this result disagrees with conclusions by many different groups , we have reanalyzed the data by some of these different authors and suggest that in most cases their conclusions were a result of calibration problems .",
    "in particular , the blue lick cn indices are relatively weak and are very sensitive to flux calibration uncertainties .",
    "we also find that the two mw gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath45 , ngc  6528 and 6553 , have weaker cn bands than their m  31 counterparts at the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether this latter difference is real or a by - product of sky - subtraction errors , or of issues with the sampling of the gcs brightest stars .",
    "other data sets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not show similar cn discrepancies between these gcs and their m  31 metal - rich counterparts . even if our results are correct , and these two gcs",
    "indeed have weaker cn indices than metal - rich m  31 gcs , the fact that they seem to depart significantly from a @xmath18fe@xmath19@xmath30 trend that is present in _ both _ samples suggests that ngc  6528 and 6553 are the exception rather than the rule .",
    "the result by @xcite that m  31 gcs have stronger cn bands than their mw counterparts of same metallicity , even though confirmed by several later studies , has always been difficult to understand because it is very hard to explain how nitrogen abundances could differ substantially between otherwise very similar systems . @xcite proposed a scenario where gcs were formed from zero - metallicity material , pre - enriched by hypernovae explosions in the center of @xmath46 gas clouds .",
    "nitrogen abundance differences between the two gc systems was the one piece of evidence that could not be explained in that scenario .",
    "we hope that the task of devising a mechanism for the formation of the haloes of the milky way and andromeda galaxies is made easier by the findings presented in this paper . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we contrast measurements of the abundance patterns of m  31 and galactic gcs , and discuss their implications to our understanding of the formation of the two galaxy haloes .",

    "<S> the conversion of instrumental equivalent widths into the lick system is described , and zero - point uncertainties are provided . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of line indices of old m  31 clusters and galactic globular clusters suggests an absence of important differences in chemical composition between the two cluster systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , cn indices in the spectra of m  31 and galactic clusters are essentially consistent with each other , in disagreement with several previous works . </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyze some of the previous data , and conclude that reported cn differences between m  31 and galactic clusters were mostly due to data calibration uncertainties . </S>",
