    "lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) has now reached the point where fully dynamical results for nucleon structure observables are available for quark masses almost corresponding to the physical pion mass @xmath0 ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "for some , but not all of these quantities , also results extracted from phenomenology exist , and it is crucial to compare the lattice results with the experimental results , in order to judge the reliablility of lqcd predictions for such quantities which are not easily accessible in experiments . for some observables , for example the axial coupling constant @xmath1 of the nucleon , and the moment @xmath2 ( isovector quark momentum fraction ) of the nucleon ,",
    "there is substantial tension between the experimental and the lattice outcome . for the latter quantity , which is the topic of the present article",
    ", we refer in particular to the very recent results and discussion in @xcite .",
    "+ the quark mass dependence of hadron observables is given by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , the low - energy effective field theory of qcd .",
    "it has often been used to extrapolate lattice data employing quark masses larger than in the real world down to the experimental point . moreover , the dependence on the spatial volume @xmath3 of the lattice can also be calculated within the same theoretical framework .",
    "this was first demonstrated in the purely goldstone - bosonic sector @xcite , and later extended to the one - baryon sector @xcite .",
    "we work in the so - called @xmath4-regime where the counting scheme is set up such that @xmath5 , where @xmath4 denotes a small quantity like a ( pseudo-)goldstone boson mass or momentum .",
    "it has become a common rule of thumb that one should have @xmath6 in order to have the finite volume corrections under theoretical control in this regime @xcite ( for the case of the pion mass at two - loop accuracy , @xcite gives a lower bound of @xmath7 for the applicability of the @xmath4-regime ) .",
    "on the other hand , there is a long - standing debate in the literature about the range of applicability of the chiral extrapolation formulae given by ( two - flavor ) baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) in terms of the quark masses or @xmath8 , see @xcite for relevant references .",
    "the opinion most generally shared today seems to be that earlier applications of bchpt formulae to lattice results for pion masses @xmath9 were not under sufficient control for a reliable extrapolation to the physical point , while ( citing the review @xcite )  it is fair to say that chiral extrapolations of nucleon properties can be trusted for pion masses below @xmath10  .",
    "of course , such statements will also depend on the particular channel or observable one is considering , on the chiral order ( accuracy ) of the calculation , and on the available information on relevant low - energy constants ( lecs ) from other sources .",
    "moreover , in a finite spatial volume @xmath3 , the pion masses should not be smaller than @xmath11 in order to stay in the above - mentioned @xmath4-regime .",
    "+ in this work , we will study the chiral extrapolation and the finite volume corrections of lattice results for the moment @xmath2 of the nucleon ( for the pertinent definitions and conventions , see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : stab ] , we neglect the finite volume corrections , and use a truncated version of the full one - loop expression for @xmath12 to test the stability of the chiral fits with respect to a variation of supplemented terms of leading two - loop order ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "encouraged by this first test , we apply the formulae derived in @xcite ( in the general setting of manifestly covariant bchpt @xcite ) to a more complete data set , and examine the finite volume corrections together with the chiral extrapolation in the pion mass in sec .  [ sec : finite ] , in three different fit scenarios .",

    ", we shall demonstrate below that , from the second perspective , bchpt can play an important role for future lattice simulations , as an indicator of the possible presence of uncontrolled systematic errors inherent in the data , even if there are data points at ( nearly ) physical quark masses and large volumes . finally , we try to give a well - founded answer to the question posed in the title in our concluding sec .",

    "the chiral expansion of @xmath2 to @xmath13 in bchpt reads @xcite @xmath14 for the lecs occuring in the leading - one - loop calculation we have used the nomenclature of @xcite , while at @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a combination of the lecs @xmath17 , @xmath18 , defined in @xcite ( see eq .",

    "the results above show that finite volume corrections are too small to account for the discrepancy found between the data point at @xmath39 and the well - known experimental value at @xmath40 .",

    "[ fig : fvshifts ] , we show the finite volume shifts @xmath44 for three fixed values of @xmath45 , as a function of @xmath8 , for the three fit scenarios @xmath46 .",
    "as can be seen , these shifts scale as @xmath47 for sufficiently small pion masses , as expected from the form of the loop corrections .",
    "the three fit scenarios studied in secs .",
    "[ sec : stab ] and [ sec : finite ] correspond to three different ways of using the bchpt formulae . from the point of view of lattice practitioners , our scenarios @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to the natural way the formulae are applied : fitting to the lattice data input , it is checked whether the value of the observable at the experimental point can be predicted from the extrapolation . from our fit @xmath50 , where the full data set including the point at the nearly physical mass ( @xmath51 ) of @xcite is inserted , we have to conclude that this is _ not _ possible .",
    "the chiral extrapolation together with the extrapolation to @xmath52 is unable to reconcile the lattice data with the phenomenological value : the finite volume corrections are much too small to allow for a downward shift of the value at the lowest lattice pion mass , sufficient to come close to the experimental result .",
    "excluding the low - mass point , we arrive at fit scenario @xmath53 , where it seems that the opposite conclusion is true - here , the extrapolation returns the phenomenological value to a satisfying degree of accuracy .",
    "this is the situation already encountered some years ago @xcite and therefore nothing new ( note , however , that previous applications of the bchpt framework to @xmath2 were only accurate at @xmath54 , since the @xmath55 term was either neglected or taken with a fixed coefficient @xmath56 ) .",
    "there are pitfalls here , however : the fit result may depend considerably on data points for relatively high @xmath8 , where the one - loop chiral representation is not reliable any more in a strict sense , as is shown e.g. by the broad band in fit @xmath57 of fig .",
    "[ fig : xumdbands1 ] , the convergence behavior illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] , and the fit results for scenario @xmath58 in sec .",
    "[ sec : stab ] .",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether the data points with @xmath59 can be adequately described with a finite volume formula employing the @xmath4-regime counting . nonetheless , it is interesting to see that the instability observed for fits @xmath60 in sec .  [",
    "sec : stab ] is eliminated in fit @xmath38 , where the additional constraints on the finite volume behavior ( as measured on the lattice ) are built in .",
    "needless to say that , for a more reliable extrapolation of lattice data , it is certainly necessary to include more data points from large volumes and @xmath61 . concerning the second perspective mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , in view of an application of the bchpt extrapolation formulae for cases in which the experimental value is not ( accurately ) known , we would like to point out that bchpt can be useful in such a situation , even if the region where it can be reliably applied is more limited than previously thought .",
    "this is demonstrated by the comparison of our fit scenarios @xmath48 and @xmath49 : in our opinion , it might be taken as an indication for a problem with some of the lattice data points that the chiral fit curves generically have the tendency to bend down at least below @xmath62 , a trend which can not be inferred from the lowest lattice data point .",
    "this indication is significant , given that the finite volume corrections are indeed small , and given that bchpt works at least close to the physical point , showing the suppression of higher orders in @xmath63 ( modulo enhanced chiral logs ) imposed by the chiral power counting ( compare e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ eq : conv ] ) ) . under these conditions",
    ", it seems unavoidable that the extrapolation curve bends down appreciably is also seen in the chiral soliton quark model ( csqm ) @xcite , see fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "up to a constant shift , the extrapolation curve in this model strongly resembles the expected behavior of the bchpt result ( like our fits @xmath57,@xmath64 ) .",
    "the same is true for the nucleon mass @xmath65 in the csqm @xcite . ] when approaching the region @xmath62 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the curve is forced to describe the lowest lattice point ( fit @xmath49 ) , the @xmath66 value increases considerably , giving rise to the reasonable suspicion that the included data points are not compatible with the expected chiral extrapolation without taking into account further systematic corrections .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out in @xcite that the effects due to the finite lattice spacing @xmath67 are not fully under control .",
    "such effects are not grasped by our present extrapolation formula either , so this is certainly a reasonable direction of further investigation .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out in @xcite that effects due to excited states tend to be larger for smaller pion masses . considering the apparent problems due to the lowest - mass data point of @xcite",
    ", we think that even though the problem of excited state contamination has been carefully studied in that work , one should thoroughly continue this route of investigation . comparing with results for nearly - physical pion masses of other collaborations",
    ", we remark that etmc @xcite finds a value for @xmath2 consistent with the one of @xcite , while lhpc @xcite obtains a result _ consistent _ with the phenomenological value , though with less statistics than achieved in @xcite .",
    "+ from the point of view of effective field theory , the experimental result is just another data point in addition to the lattice data , with @xmath68 and @xmath52 , and it is interesting in itself to study the functional form and properties of the chiral extrapolation and the values of the lecs using this experimental result as a constraint",
    ". the determination of the lecs can be useful in the study of other observables , or for a combined fit to several different nucleon structure properties .",
    "it also allows to assess the region of applicability of the bchpt formalism , which is also a much - debated topic in the literature on effective field theories @xcite . for our fit strategy",
    "@xmath64 corresponding to this philosophy ( related to the first perspective on chiral extrapolations mentioned in sec .  [ sec : intro ] ) , we find a remarkable stability of the functional form of the extrapolation , compare e.g. the results of fits @xmath64 and @xmath69 in tab .",
    "[ tab : fit2000 ] , and also the result of fit @xmath70 and @xmath71 including finite volume corrections ( tab .  [ tab : fvfits ] ) .",
    "in particular , the comparison shows that we could obtain a rough estimate of the finite volume effects already from the fits @xmath72 of sec .",
    "[ sec : stab ] , where only the largest volumes were included .",
    "the pion mass dependence is also under control for these fits , as can be seen from the comparison of the full one - loop form ( for @xmath52 ) , employed in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite ] , with the truncated expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xumdexpansion ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ eq : parsfit2 ] ) and @xmath74.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    but even though the results of the fits @xmath70 , @xmath71 seem very natural and reliable from the bchpt viewpoint , we can not conclude that they yield the correct extrapolation function , unless we have a good argument why only the data points with @xmath75 are afflicted with some significant systematic error . + in our analysis , we have applied the framework outlined in @xcite , where a field corresponding to the @xmath76 resonance is not included as an explicit degree of freedom . for studies where this resonance is included explicitly , see @xcite .",
    "it is non - trivial to include the @xmath76 in manifestly covariant bchpt due to problems with the power - counting scheme , and the presence of additional unphysical degrees of freedom in the covariant description of higher - spin fields ( @xmath77 ) . for a discussion of these issues",
    "we refer to @xcite , and references cited therein . working at @xmath15 , having three free fit parameters at hand , we expect that , for fixed delta - nucleon mass splitting and sufficiently small pion masses , the extrapolation would only be mildly different when including the @xmath78 field , as the effects due to the resonance can mostly be absorbed in the coefficients of the local interaction terms .",
    "a conclusion pointing in this direction can also be inferred from the results of ref .",
    "but still , this point clearly deserves further study .",
    "baryon chiral perturbation theory can be used to study the chiral extrapolation of @xmath2 , but it should be applied with great care . in our opinion , one should make sure that : ( 1 ) higher order corrections with a reasonable strength do not alter the resulting extrapolation curve dramatically , ( 2 ) the convergence properties of the expanded extrapolation formula are at least roughly in accord with the expectations from chiral power counting , ( 3 ) the consideration of the finite volume effects do not lead to unreasonably large shifts of the fitted lecs , ( 4 ) if data with @xmath9 is included in the fit , the presence of these points has no big influence on the results , and ( 5 ) the resulting lecs are of natural size . under these conditions , one can talk of a reliable extrapolation .",
    "if the according experimental result is accurately known , this extrapolation can be directly checked , which may serve as a further test whether the lattice data is afflicted with a systematic error not incorporated in the effective field theory . as was pointed out in the discussion in the previous section ,",
    "this may be also possible if the experimental value is not available : if the chiral fit to the data set only returns results with a high @xmath66 value , with an extrapolation function showing a bad convergence of the chiral expansion already at relatively small quark masses , and/or lecs of an unexpected size , these features can be seen as an indication ( though of course not a proof ) that some uncontrolled systematic error is still present in the lattice calculation . as should have become clear from our previous discussion , there is a clear indication that such an error source ( like e.  g. discretization effects ) is present in the case of lattice data for @xmath2 .",
    "this indication can be further sharpened if some systematics is observed in the examination of this criterion ( like in our comparison of fits @xmath49 and @xmath48 , which provided evidence that the behavior of the data for very low @xmath8 is problematic from the chpt perspective ) . in this way",
    ", chiral extrapolations can prove useful even if simulations are performed at nearly physical pion masses and large volumes .",
    "it is this kind of application of bchpt which we propose to consider in present - day and future lattice studies of @xmath2 and other quantities parameterizing the structure of the nucleon . + as an extension of the extrapolation framework used here @xcite",
    ", one should consider the effects due to the @xmath76 resonance along the lines of @xcite . on a level of higher accuracy ,",
    "also isospin - breaking corrections should be incorporated .",
    "additionally , a combined fit of several nucleon structure functions should finally be undertaken .",
    "only then , the full strength of ( b)chpt comes into play , yielding relations between different observables imposed by chiral symmetry ( and other symmetries of the strong interaction ) .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the analogues of the moment @xmath2 for the full baryon ground - state octet ( the form factors @xmath79 at @xmath80 , for all combinations of baryon states and flavor structures of the operator insertions ) have also been calculated in ( three - flavor ) bchpt at leading one - loop order @xcite .",
