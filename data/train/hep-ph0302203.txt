    "exclusive vector meson production is an important process which can provide information on hadronic structure at large and small distances and nature of soft and hard interaction dynamics . as it follows from the hera data @xcite the integral cross section of the elastic vector meson production @xmath1 increases with energy in a way similar to the @xmath2 dependence on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it appeared also that the growth of the vector ",
    "meson electroproduction cross ",
    "section with energy is steeper for heavier vector mesons .",
    "similar effect takes also place when the virtuality @xmath4 increases .    the preliminary data of zeus collaboration @xcite",
    "provide an indication for an energy independence of the ratio of the cross section of exclusive @xmath0 electroproduction to the total cross section .",
    "such behavior of this ratio is at variance with perturbative qcd results @xcite , regge and dipole approaches @xcite .",
    "recent review of the related problems and successes of the various theoretical approaches can be found in @xcite .",
    "of course , the energy range of the available data is limited and the above mentioned contradiction could probably be avoided due to fine tuning of the appropriate models . meanwhile , similar energy independence was obtained in the approach based on the off - shell extension of the @xmath5channel unitarity @xcite . in this note",
    "we provide an additional discussion pointing out to the origin of the above energy independence .",
    "we perform a quantitative comparison of the hera data on vector  meson production with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "there is no universal , generally accepted method to obey unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "however , long time ago the arguments based on analytical properties of the scattering amplitude were put forward @xcite in favor of the rational form of unitarization .",
    "unitarity can be written for both real and virtual external particles scattering amplitudes .",
    "however , implications of unitarity are different for the scattering of real and virtual particles .",
    "the extension of the @xmath6matrix unitarization scheme ( rational form of unitarization ) for the off - shell scattering was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was supposed as usual that the virtual photon fluctuates into a quark  antiquark and this pair can be treated as an effective virtual vector meson state .",
    "there were considered limitations the unitarity provides for the @xmath7total cross - sections and geometrical effects in the energy dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that the solution of the extended unitarity augmented by an assumption of the @xmath4dependent constituent quark interaction radius results in the following dependence at high energies : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is saturated at large values of @xmath4 and reaches unity .",
    "however , off ",
    "shell unitarity does not require transformation of this power - like dependence into a logarithmic one at asymptotical energies .",
    "thus , power  like behavior of the cross  sections with the exponent dependent on virtuality could be of an asymptotical nature and have a physical ground .",
    "it should not be regarded merely as a transitory behavior or a convenient way to represent the data .",
    "the extended unitarity for the off  mass  shell amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 has a structure similar to the equation for the on  shell amplitude @xmath13 but in the former case it relates the different amplitudes .",
    "we denoted in that way the amplitudes when both initial and final mesons are off mass shell , only initial meson is off mass shell and both mesons are on mass shell , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath8 is determined by the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath11 , whereas @xmath14 is determined by the square of another amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "the important point in the solution of the extended unitarity is the factorization in the impact parameter representation at the level of the input dynamical quantity    @xmath6matrix : @xmath15 ^ 2=0.\\label{zr}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ zr ] ) reflects universality of the initial and final state interactions when transition between on and off  mass shell states occurs . despite that such factorization",
    "does not survive at the level of the amplitudes @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( i.e. after unitarity equations are solved and fourier - bessel transform is performed ) , it is essential for the energy independence of the ratio of the exclusive @xmath0 electroproduction cross section to the total cross section .",
    "the above result ( [ sigt ] ) is valid when the interaction radius of the constituent quark @xmath19 from the virtual meson @xmath20 increases with virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "we use the same notation @xmath19 for the constituent quarks and virtuality , but it should not lead to misunderstanding .",
    "the dependence of the interaction radius @xmath21 on @xmath4 comes through the dependence of the universal @xmath4-dependent factor @xmath22 ( in the on - shell limit @xmath23 ) .",
    "the origin of the rising interaction radius of the constituent quark @xmath19 with virtuality @xmath4 might be of a dynamical nature and it would steam from the emission of the additional @xmath24pairs in the nonperturbative structure of a constituent quark .",
    "available experimental data are consistent with the @xmath25dependence of the radius @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are universal for all constituent quarks .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath4 dependent interaction radius of a constituent quark , which in this approach consists of a current quark surrounded by the cloud of quark  antiquark pairs of different flavors @xcite , is the main issue of the off  shell extension of the model , which provides at large values of @xmath3 @xmath31 where @xmath32 the value of parameter @xmath28 in the model is determined by the slope of the differential cross ",
    "section of elastic scattering at large @xmath33 region @xcite and it follows from the @xmath34-experimental data that @xmath35 .",
    "inclusion of heavy vector meson production into this scheme is straightforward : the virtual photon fluctuates before the interaction with proton into the heavy quark ",
    "antiquark pair which constitutes the virtual heavy vector meson state . after interaction with a proton",
    "this state turns out into a real heavy vector meson .",
    "integral exclusive ( elastic ) cross  section of vector meson production in the process @xmath36 when the vector meson in the final state contains not necessarily light quarks can be calculated directly : @xmath37 where @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ lavm ] ) @xmath39 denotes the mass of the constituent quarks from the vector meson and @xmath40 is the mean constituent quark mass of the vector meson and proton system . of course , for the on  shell scattering ( @xmath41 ) we have a standard froissart  like asymptotic energy dependence .",
    "it is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ totv ] ) and ( [ elvec ] ) that @xmath42 for the light vector mesons , i.e. the ratio @xmath43 does not depend on energy for @xmath44 .",
    "( [ elvec ] ) and consequently ( [ rv ] ) are in a good agreement ( fig .",
    "1 ) with the experimental data of h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the experimental definition of the ratio @xmath45 adopted by the zeus collaboration @xcite considers cross  sections at the different virtualities and does not directly correspond to ( [ rv ] ) .",
    "= 2.6 in = 2.2 in = 2.6 in = 2.2 in    for the case of the heavy vector meson production @xmath46 and @xmath47 the respective cross ",
    "section rises about two times faster than the total cross  section ; eq .",
    "( [ lavm ] ) results in @xmath48 i.e. @xmath49 corresponding relations for the @xmath50meson production are the following @xmath51 in the limiting case when the vector meson is very heavy , i.e. @xmath52 the relation between exponents is @xmath53 the quantitative agreement of eq .",
    "( [ elvec ] ) with experimental data for the case of @xmath50 and @xmath54 production can be seen in fig .",
    "2    = 2.6 in = 2.1 in = 2.6 in = 2.1 in    this agreement is in favor of relation ( [ lavm ] ) which provides explicit mass dependence of the exponent in the power  like energy dependence of cross  sections .",
    "thus , the power - like parameterization of the ratio @xmath45 @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath4dependent exponent could also have a physical ground .",
    "it would be interested therefore to check experimentally the predicted energy dependence of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the dependence of the constituent quark interaction radius ( [ rqvi ] ) on its mass and virtuality gets an experimental support and the non  universal energy asymptotical dependence ( [ elvec ] ) and ( [ lavm ] ) and predicted in @xcite does not contradict to the high  energy experimental data on elastic vector  meson electroproduction . of course ,",
    "as it was already mentioned in the introduction , the limited energy range of the available experimental data allows other parameterizations , e. g. universal asymptotical regge  type behavior with @xmath4independent trajectories ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , to treat the experimental regularities as transitory ones .",
    "it seems , however , that the scattering of virtual particles reaches the asymptotics much faster than the scattering of the real particles and the @xmath4dependent exponent @xmath10 reflects the asymptotical dependence and not the `` effective '' preasymptotical one . despite that the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath10 implies a saturation of the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath10 at large values of @xmath4 , the power  like energy dependence itself will survive at asymptotical energy values . the early asymptotics of virtual particle scattering",
    "is correlated with the peripheral impact parameter behavior of the scattering amplitude for the virtual particles .",
    "the respective profiles of the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath57 are peripheral when @xmath22 increases with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the energy independence of the ratio @xmath58 reflects universality of the initial and final state interactions responsible for the transition between the on and off  mass shell states .",
    "this universality is a quite natural assumption leading to factorization ( [ zr ] ) at the level of the @xmath6matrix @xcite . under this",
    "the off  shell unitarity is the principal origin of the energy independence of the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "there are also other interesting manifestations of the off ",
    "shell unitarity effects , e.g. the behavior of the differential cross  sections at large @xmath33 is to a large extent determined by the off - shell unitarity effects . indeed ,",
    "a smooth power  like dependence on @xmath33 has been predicted @xcite : @xmath59^{-3},\\ ] ] where @xmath60.\\ ] ] as it is seen from fig .",
    "( [ ttri ] ) corresponds to experimental data for @xmath54 vector meson even at the very moderate @xmath33-values .",
    "this fact is due to the effect of large mass of charmed quark which enhances in the model contribution of the region of small impact parameters .",
    "= 2.5 in    it appears that differential cross section does not depend on energy and depends on @xmath33 in a simple power - like way @xmath61 .",
    "this dependence differs from the corresponding dependence in the case of on - shell exclusive scattering @xcite which approximates the quark counting rule @xcite .",
    "the ratio of differential cross - sections for the exclusive production of the different vector mesons @xmath62 does not depend on the variables @xmath3 and @xmath33 at large enough values of @xmath63 .",
    "meanwhile the orear type behavior of the differential cross - section of the vector meson photoproduction obtained in @xcite @xmath64.\\ ] ] is in a good agreement with the hera experimental data at moderate values of @xmath33 ( cf .",
