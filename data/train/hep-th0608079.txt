    "so far , many interesting studies have been performed on this line @xcite . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we showed scale independence of the effective coupling constants of the composite fields , in three examples of models : ( i ) scalar composite in six dimensions , ( ii ) nambu - jona - lasinio model in four dimensions , and ( iii ) induced gauge theory in four dimensions .",
    "this property of scale independence seems to common to the many of the quantum composite models , and exhibits sharp contrast with the scale dependence of the running coupling constants in the elementary field theories .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss further details of the scalar - composite model in six dimensions .",
    "this model resembles the nambu - jona - lasinio model for fermions in four dimensions , serving as a toy model without fermionic complexities .",
    "the scalar fields in six dimensions also attract attentions in connection with the braneworld theories in extra dimensions .",
    "for example , they are expected to provide models for solitonic confinement of the fields within our four dimensional spacetime .",
    "the plan for this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "strictly speaking , this is a scalar - composite - scalar model , which means a model of a composite scalar field made of two elementary scalar fields .",
    "we can well investigate this model by using equivalence to the renormalizable three - elementary - scalar model under the compositeness condition .",
