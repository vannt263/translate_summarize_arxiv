    "<S> recent study shows that the accuracy of the @xmath0-shell method in determining node coreness in a spreading process is largely impacted due to the existence of core - like group , which has a large @xmath0-shell index but a low spreading efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> based on analysis of the structure of core - like groups in real - world networks , we discover that nodes in the core - like group are mutually densely connected with very few out - leaving links from the group . by defining a measure of diffusion importance for each edge based on the number of out - leaving links of its both ends , we are able to identify redundant links in the spreading process , which have a relatively low diffusion importance but lead to form the locally densely connected core - like group . after filtering out the redundant links and applying the @xmath0-shell method to the residual network , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a renewed coreness @xmath1 for each node which is a more accurate index to indicate its location importance and spreading influence in the original network . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the performance of the ranking algorithms based on the renewed coreness are also greatly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> our findings help to more accurately decompose the network core structure and identify influential nodes in spreading processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of network science has made it a powerful tool to model and analyze complex systems in nature and society  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one fundamental aspect is to understand the complex structures and behaviors of real - world networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> network structure can be described from the local , global and meso - scale levels  @xcite such as node degree , clustering , degree distributions , degree correlations , motifs , communities , hierarchies , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-shell decomposition is a method used to partition a network into hierarchically ordered sub - structures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it decomposes a network in an iterative way , removing all nodes of degree less than current shell index until no removing is possible ( see methods for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> each node is assigned an index @xmath1 to represent its coreness in the network . </S>",
    "<S> nodes with the same @xmath1 constitute the @xmath1-shell . </S>",
    "<S> a large @xmath1 indicates a core position in the network , while a small @xmath1 defines the periphery of the network . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-core , nodes with @xmath2 , obtained in the decomposition process is a highly interconnected substructure in network topology  @xcite , which has found its application in different fields of science , like biology  @xcite , economics  @xcite , and social science  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , nodes in the inner core ( large @xmath1 region ) have a relatively high probability of being essential and evolutionary conserved in the protein interaction network  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . nodes in the innermost core ( the shell with the largest @xmath1 value in the network ) of the global economic network are most probable to trigger out an economic crisis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high @xmath0-cores of the air transportation networks in usa are extremely resilient to both the node removal and edge removal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of its low computational complexity of @xmath3  @xcite , where @xmath4 is the network size and @xmath5 is the number of edges in the network , the @xmath0-shell method is extensively used in analyzing the hierarchical structure of large - scale networks , such as visualizing networks  @xcite , depicting the network core - periphery features  @xcite , and analyzing the internet and its core  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath0-core is used to construct network model  @xcite , applied in community detection  @xcite and @xmath0-core percolation is extensively studied which gives a notion of network resilience under random attack  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-shell method is also extended to weighted networks  @xcite , dynamic networks  @xcite and multiplex networks  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> considering that the @xmath0-shell method decomposes the network into ordered shells from the core to the periphery , researchers found that core nodes of the network are more influential that periphery nodes in a spreading dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following the work , there is growing interest in using the @xmath1 index to rank nodes of their spreading efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> nodes with large @xmath1 are considered to be more influential and effective than others in a spreading process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , some works devise ranking algorithms based on @xmath1 of nodes  @xcite . despite its effectiveness , however , the coreness determined by the @xmath0-shell method has some limitations in identifying influential spreaders . in the rumor spreading model , nodes with high coreness are not influential spreaders but act as firewall to prevent the rumor from spreading to the whole network  @xcite . for dynamics with steady state , nodes with the highest degree acts more important than the core nodes in uncorrelated networks if the degree distribution of the network has a decay exponent larger than @xmath6  @xcite . in network with tree structure or ba model network , </S>",
    "<S> most of the nodes are assigned a same @xmath1 value , thus the @xmath0-shell index is unable to distinguish node importance  @xcite . in particular , in our recent study  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we shows that in some real - world networks the core nodes as identified by the @xmath0-shell decomposition are not the most influential spreaders . </S>",
    "<S> specifically speaking , there exists core - like groups which are identified as cores with large @xmath1 but are in fact only locally densely connected groups with relatively low spreading efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the @xmath1 index may be inaccurate to reflect the location importance of nodes in networks with such local structure , which proposes a great challenge for works using the @xmath0-shell method to identify network cores and rank nodes .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the topological feature of the core - like groups and find out the connection pattern that causes the failure of the @xmath1 index to accurately determine the location importance and spreading influence of nodes in networks with such local structure . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we propose a way to improve the accuracy of the @xmath0-shell method in determining node coreness from the perspective of spreading dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the research advances in core - periphery structure  @xcite , in which core nodes are not only densely connected among themselves but also well connected to the periphery nodes , which are sparsely connected to any other , we consider the characteristics of links a core node should have . specifically speaking </S>",
    "<S> , links of core nodes should not only connect core nodes , but also connect to nodes that are not in the core . </S>",
    "<S> to quantitatively determine the effect of a link in a spreading process , we define a measure of diffusion importance based on the connection patterns of its two ends . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there exists some redundant links in real - world networks , which have a low diffusion importance but lead to form the core - like group . by filtering out the redundant links from the original network and applying the @xmath0-shell decomposition on the residual network , we obtain a renewed coreness @xmath1 for each node . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath1 is a much more accurate index to indicate the node importance in a dynamic spreading in the original network . </S>",
    "<S> we validate this by simulating the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemic process on networks and compare the spreading efficiency of nodes from the core to the periphery , which is used in many research works  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that ranking algorithms based on the @xmath0-shell method are also greatly enhanced once using the renewed @xmath1 obtained from the residual network . </S>"
