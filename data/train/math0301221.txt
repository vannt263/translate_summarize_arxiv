    "the language of operads was invented by m.boardman , r.vogt and p.may @xcite .",
    "a nonsymmetric ( topological ) operad is a sequence of topological spaces @xmath25 ( called the _ underlying collection _ ) together with unit @xmath26 and multiplication @xmath27 which satisfies associativity and unitarity conditions .",
    "the nonsymmetric operads form a category .",
    "the morphisms are levelwise morphisms of underlying collections which preserve multiplication and units .",
    "there are two important examples .",
    "the first is the endomorphism operad @xmath28 of a topological space @xmath2 : @xmath29 the unit is given by the identity morphism and multiplication by iterated composition of @xmath1-ary maps .",
    "the second example is the sequence of stasheff s associahedra . here",
    "multiplication is given by an appropriate inclusion of @xmath30 to the boundary of @xmath31 defined by stasheff @xcite .",
    "an algebra of an operad @xmath32 is a topological space @xmath2 equipped with a morphism of operads @xmath33    the stasheff s recognition principle for a topological space @xmath2 can be formulated now as the existence of a @xmath34-algebra structure on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , one can use any other contractible nonsymmetric operad for the recognition principle .",
    "the operad @xmath34 is then an initial ( up to higher homotopies ) object in the category of contractible nonsymmetric operads ( if we ignore units ) .",
    "so the language of nonsymmetric operads is esentially equivalent to the direct combinatorial approach of stasheff",
    ".    however , for the study of homotopy commutativity the nonsymmetric operads are not enough .",
    "a symmetric ( topological ) operad is a sequence of topological spaces @xmath25 ( called the _ underlying collection _ ) together with unit @xmath26 and multiplication @xmath27 and actions of the symmetric groups @xmath35 on @xmath36 which satisfy associativity , unitarity and equivariancy conditions .",
    "the endomorphism operad has a natural action of the symmetric groups and can be completed to a symmetric operad structure .",
    "it is now easy to define algebras of a symmetric operads .",
    "a connected topological space @xmath2 is an infinite loop space if and only if it has an action of a contractible symmetric operad .    for finite values of @xmath1",
    "there are symmetric operads which detect @xmath1-fold loop spaces : the so called little @xmath1-cube operads @xmath37 and anything equivalent to them ( _ @xmath38-operads _ ) .",
    "yet , they are very complicated from a homotopy point of view : @xmath39 is homotopy equivalent to the space of configurations of @xmath40-distinct points in @xmath1-dimensional real space .",
    "_ there is no known characterisation of @xmath38-operads similar to the characterisation of @xmath41 and @xmath42 operads except for @xmath43 _ @xcite .",
    "now , if we try to write down explicitly the coherence laws for an @xmath1-fold loop space using the action of an @xmath38-operad we will have the same trouble as in the previous subsection .",
    "so the approach based on symmetric operads , being very powerful in many respects , still tells almost nothing about the combinatorics of higher homotopies for @xmath44 .",
    "we quote j.baez and p.may : `  work of boardman and vogt , may , and segal gave conceptual encapsulations that hid the implicit higher homotopies , whose combinatorial structure is still somewhat obscure ' @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to give a conceptual approach to the combinatorics of @xmath1-fold loop spaces .",
    "it has two essential ingredients .",
    "first we suggest to replace symmetric operads by higher nonsymmetric operads which appeared in higher category theory @xcite .",
    "the intuition behind this approach is that @xmath38-space must be equivalent to _ @xmath1-tuple weak @xmath45-groupoid _ i.e. a weak @xmath45-groupoid with one object , one arrow ,  , one @xmath46-arrow , as have been conjectured by j.baez and j.dolan @xcite .",
    "the decisive step to make this intuition precise was made by us in @xcite .",
    "here we already proved that in this theory we have a simple characterisation of so called @xmath46-terminal @xmath1-operads ( see definition [ terminal ] ) which detect @xmath1-fold loop spaces : they are just the contractible @xmath1-operads .",
    "the second ingredient is the idea to consider some sort of ` universal categorical model ' for a given theory of operads . to explain this better",
    "let us recall a well known fact that the poset of faces of the associahedron can be described in terms of planar trees .",
    "moreover , the planar trees can be organised into a category , and even a categorical nonsymmetric operad @xmath47 such that the classifying space of @xmath48 is exactly @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the classical tree formalism is based on the observation that every operad produces a functor on @xmath48 .",
    "in @xcite we observed that the existence of this formalism is due to the fact that the categorical operad @xmath47 is actually a categorical nonsymmetric operad ( without nullary operations ) freely generated by an internal nonunital nonsymmetric operad .",
    "actually , in @xcite we work with the full operadic structure with nullary opertions and units and we construct a categorical symmetric operad @xmath49 freely generated by an internal nonsymmetric operad .",
    "it is easy to make appropriate modifications if we want to produce @xmath48 .    in some sense the combinatorics of @xmath41-spaces",
    "is governed by the categorical operad @xmath48 or @xmath49 if we want to work with the full structure including homotopy units .",
    "using these ideas we show that there exist appropriate @xmath1-dimensional analogues of @xmath49 and the combinatorics of @xmath38-spaces is governed by this categorical @xmath1-operad .",
    "even though this combinatorics is much more complicated than in stasheff s case we show that there is no obstacle to writing it down explicitly .",
    "we also consider the relationships between @xmath1-operads and symmetric operads more closely . in @xcite",
    "we established an adjunction @xmath50 between these two categories of operads , which is the usual adjunction between symmetric and nonsymmetric operads in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath51 when @xmath52 . in this paper",
    "we define model category structures on the categories of topological @xmath46-terminal @xmath1-operads and topological symmetric operads and show that the adjunction above gives rise to a quillen adjunction @xcite .    using this techniques",
    "we demonstrate that the classifying space @xmath53 of the categorical operad @xmath54 constructed in @xcite is a cofibrant replacement for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the operad of iterated monoidal categories introduced in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to look closer at the combinatorial structure of @xmath38-operads and we show that such an operad is actually homotopically freely generated by its internal @xmath1-operad .    in the last section we illustrate on some examples how this theory can be applied to produce some coherence laws .",
    "we are going to develop this theme in a further paper .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the theory developed in @xcite to make our paper relatively self contained .",
    "we do not give full definitions of monoidal globular category and @xmath1-operad here because we need only some properties of them established in @xcite .",
    "for a natural number @xmath1 we will denote by @xmath57 $ ] the ordinal @xmath58 in particular @xmath59 $ ] will denote the empty ordinal .",
    "a tree of height @xmath1 ( or simply @xmath1-tree ) is a chain of order preserving maps of ordinals @xmath60\\stackrel{\\rho_{n-1}}{\\longrightarrow}[k_{n-1}]\\stackrel{\\rho_{n-2}}{\\longrightarrow } ... \\stackrel{\\rho_0}{\\longrightarrow } [ 1]\\ ] ]    if @xmath61 $ ] and there is no @xmath62 $ ] such that @xmath63 then we call @xmath64 _ a leaf of @xmath65 of height @xmath64_. we will call the leaves of @xmath65 of height @xmath1 _ the tips _ of @xmath65 . if for an @xmath1-tree @xmath65 all its leaves are tips we call such a tree _ pruned_.    we illustrate the definition in a picture     ( 290,110)[r ]    the tree on the left side of the picture is not pruned since it has two leaves which are not tips .",
    "the tree on the right side has the empty ordinal at the highest level ; we will call such trees _",

    "so we have a globular structure on the set of all trees .",
    "we actually have more .",
    "the trees form an @xmath45-category @xmath73 with the set of @xmath1-cells being equal to the set of the trees of height @xmath1 . if two @xmath1-trees @xmath74 and @xmath65 have the same @xmath40-sources and @xmath40-targets ( i.e. @xmath75 ) then they can be composed , and the composite will be denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath77 is the operation of taking the identity of the @xmath1-cell @xmath65 .",
    "here is an example of the @xmath78-categorical operations on trees     ( 300,130)[r ]    the @xmath45-category @xmath73 is actually the free @xmath45-category generated by the terminal globular set .",
    "every @xmath1-tree can be considered as a special sort of @xmath1-pasting diagram called _ globular .",

    "here are a couple of examples .",

    "this is the free @xmath45-category generated by @xmath2 . in this way we have a monad @xmath81 on the category of globular sets , which plays a central role in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath82 we also can consider @xmath83 .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the @xmath1-cells of @xmath84 can be identified with the morphisms of another category introduced by a.joyal in @xcite .",
    "this category was called @xmath85 and some properties of it were studied later in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was found that the collection of categories @xmath85 forms an @xmath45-category in @xmath86 and , moreover , it is freely generated by an internal @xmath45-category .",
