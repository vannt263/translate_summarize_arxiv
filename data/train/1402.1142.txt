    "they represented the starting point of the specific study .",
    "spectacular progress in computational micromagnetism has led to a shift in this domain of solid state theory .",
    "micromagnetic simulations are now a commonly used , convenient , reliable and important means of research to investigate the properties of ferromagnetic nanostructures . while this has helped considerably in disseminating the fundamentals of micromagnetism to a broad scientific community ,",
    "the limits of the range of validity of the theory have received less attention . as a result , many powerful and easy - to - use programs are sometimes applied to problems that go beyond the range of validity of the underlying theory . a typical situation where this occurs",
    "is when strongly inhomogeneous magnetic structures develop .",
    "this article aims to point out some pitfalls that one encounters in numerical micromagnetics in the case of highly inhomogeneous structures and discusses possibilities of treating such pathological cases .",
    "the article is structured as follows . after a description of the basic equations and the fundamental assumptions on which the theory of micromagnetism is based ,",
    "the difference between discretization errors and methodological errors is briefly discussed in section [ err - types - sec ] .",
    "the importance of the exchange lengths as the typical length scale above which static micromagnetic theory is valid is recalled in section [ wall - sect ] using the example of a one - dimensional domain wall .",
    "the limiting case where the domain wall width collapses to zero is discussed in section [ bp - sect ] , which describes bloch point singularities and their behavior in numerical studies . using the exchange length as a reference scale , in section [ analysis - sect ] we analyze , compare and quantify analytic and numeric errors that occur when a spin spiral has a periodicity smaller than the exchange length , thereby connecting the cases of a smooth and an abrupt transition .",
    "finally , in section [ fast - sect ] , a short discussion of the limits of validity of the dynamic equations in the case of ultrafast processes emphasizes that strongly inhomogeneous structures are only one of several cases where micromagnetism reaches its limits .",
    "calculating the spatial and temporal evolution of the magnetization in a ferromagnet is the central task of micromagnetic theory .",
    "the magnetization @xmath2 is defined as the density of magnetic moments @xcite ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the volume of a mesoscopic part of the sample around @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a microscopic magnetic moment at the point @xmath7 within @xmath4 .",
    "even though the microscopic magnetic moment at a point within a ferromagnet results from the electronic structure of the material , it can be assumed for simplicity that @xmath6 are atomistic magnetic moments .",
    "the volume @xmath4 is sufficiently small so that the magnetization is homogeneous and hence the magnitude of the magnetization @xmath8 is a constant material parameter : the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the transition from a set of @xmath9 microscopic magnetic moments located at atomic lattice sites @xmath7 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath10 to a continuous vector field of the magnetization @xmath2 is also performed for the calculation of the magnetostatic field .",
    "the dipolar magnetic field @xmath11 at the position @xmath7 results from the sum of the field of each magnetic moment , @xmath12\\cdot(\\bm{r}-\\bm{r'})}{\\left|\\bm{r}-\\bm{r'}\\right|^5 } -\\frac{\\bm{\\mu_{r'}}(t)}{\\left|\\bm{r}-\\bm{r'}\\right|^3 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] can be converted into an integral over the density of magnetic moments , leading to    @xmath13    where the magnetostatic potential @xmath14 is    @xmath15    the first integral on the right hand side runs over the volume of the ferromagnet , and the second integral over the surface @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 is the outward oriented unit vector perpendicular to the surface and @xmath17 is an infinitesimal surface element .",
    "micromagnetic theory contains a further energy term which is based on the transition from a set of discrete magnetic moments to a continuous density of magnetic moments : the exchange interaction . in its simplest form ,",
    "the interatomic exchange is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the exchange energy ,  nn \" denotes a summation over nearest neighbors , @xmath20 is the normalized magnetic moment @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the heisenberg exchange integral . in eq .",

    "an example is the magneto - crystalline anisotropy , which in its simplest form is uniaxial and is described by an energy density term @xmath30 ^ 2\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the uniaxial anisotropy constant and @xmath32 is a unit vector parallel to the easy axis .",
    "the equation of motion of the vector field of the magnetization @xmath2 is the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gilbert damping parameter and @xmath35 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the effective field @xmath36 contains contributions of the external field , the internal magnetosotatic field , the exchange field and the anisotropy field .",
    "in spite of spectacular advances in numerical methods , including powerful gpu - accelerated simulations @xcite and the near - perfect reproduction of experimental observations @xcite , it remains inevitable that results from micromagnetic codes contain two types of errors .",
    "the first is the discretization error ; the second error arises from the limitations of the underlying theory .",
    "both errors are usually negligible , but can become significant in cases where the structure of the magnetization becomes exceptionally inhomogeneous .",
    "discretization errors stem from the use of a finite set of data points .",
    "the data provided by simulation results at these discretization points constitutes an approximation of the magnetization field @xmath2 , which is assumed to be continuous , _",
    "i.e. _ , smooth and with a well - defined value at any point . based on the computed set of data ,",
    "an approximation for the field can be achieved , _",
    "e.g. _ , by a piecewise constant or a piecewise linear representation of @xmath37 in the region between the discretization points .",
    "the quality of this approximation obviously depends on the density of discretization points , and the discretization errors go to zero in the limit of infinitely small cell sizes .",
    "while this limit can not be achieved in practice , it is often possible to extrapolate the data to zero cell size by using a set of different grids .",
    "the second error arises from the micromagnetic theory itself .",
    "one of its fundamental assumptions is the condition ( [ small - ang ] ) , which states that the magnetization changes slowly on the length scale of the atomistic lattice parameter .",
    "this is justified by the dominant influence of the ferromagnetic exchange on short length scales , which tends to align neighboring spins parallel to each other .",
    "the assumption of small angles between neighboring spins is usually a very good approximation , but for a correct interpretation of simulation data it is important to identify the exceptions in which this assumption fails .    in the following",
    "we shall illustrate and quantify the impact of these two types of errors in the case of strongly inhomogeneous magnetic structures .",
    "a rigorous , quantitative analysis of numerical errors would generally require an important arsenal of methodologies which are specific to the applied numerical method .",
    "our approach will be more heuristic , but it should capture the essential features in sufficient detail .",
    "it will consist in studying situations where analytic results are available , and comparing them with the computed data .",
    "let us first recall the textbook example of a bloch wall in a bulk ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy @xcite , a case where the assumption of smooth changes of the magnetization is appropriate .",
    "the analytic solution for the profile of a @xmath39 domain wall is obtained by minimizing a functional containing two energy terms .",
    "the one - dimensional variational problem then yields the typical kink shape of the domain wall profile shown in fig .",
    "it displays the value of the @xmath40-component of the reduced magnetization @xmath41 as a function of the position @xmath42 .",
    "the easy axis points along @xmath40 and the domain wall centered at @xmath43 .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "spherical variables are used to ensure that @xmath46 , and one obtains an angle @xmath47 which defines the components of the magnetization @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetization varies only along @xmath42 , and that @xmath50 .",
    "the latter condition ascertains that the rotation of the magnetization is perpendicular to the domain wall plane , as is the case for a bloch wall .",
    "the red line displays the profile of an idealized one - dimensional 180@xmath38 domain wall in an infinitely extended ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the direction of the easy axis is along @xmath40 and the red line displays the @xmath40-component of the normalized magnetization . in the case of a bloch wall ,",
    "the @xmath42 component is zero for all @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding domain wall width @xmath51 according to lilley is sketched below .",
    "close to the middle of the domain wall , @xmath43 , the domain wall profile is very similar to that of a spin spiral with wave length @xmath52 , displayed in blue.,width=264 ]    according to lilley @xcite the domain wall width @xmath53 is proportional to the exchange length @xmath54 .",
    "the one - dimensional bloch wall profile may therefore serve to introduce the exchange length @xmath55 as a micromagnetic length scale , which can be considered as a tradeoff between the competing tendencies of the exchange interaction and the magneto - crystalline anisotropy . with the given boundary conditions and the constraint @xmath46 ,",
    "the magneto - crystalline anisotropy alone would favor a @xmath39 transition from @xmath56 to @xmath57 on a length scale as short as possible , while the exchange energy would be reduced by spreading the domain wall over a region as large as possible . in a similar fashion , nel walls in thin films @xcite lead to another exchange length @xmath58^{1/2}$ ] , which results from the competition between the magnetostatic and the exchange interaction .    for a given ferromagnetic material",
    ", @xmath59 describes the typical size of inhomogeneities , like domain walls or vortices .",
    "this role of the exchange lengths has been discussed in detail , _",
    "e.g. _ , by kronmller @xcite . in all practical cases",
    "@xmath60 is much larger than the atomic lattice constant , with typical values in the range between a few nm and several tens of nanometers .",
    "this provides _ a posteriori _ the justification for the approximation described by eq .",
    "( [ small - ang ] ) , according to which inhomogeneities of the magnetization are negligible on the atomic length scale .    in view of this interpretation of @xmath60 as the characteristic size of inhomogeneous magnetic structures ,",
    "it is clear that discretization cells in simulations should not be larger than @xmath60 in order to capture the details of the magnetic structure .",
    "this notwithstanding , there can be situations where finer grids will be required or coarser grids admissible . since @xmath60 generally represents an estimate for the upper limit of the cell size , the question may arise whether a lower limit exists below which cell sizes are not allowed .",
    "the answer is no : cell sizes can be arbitrarily small ; even smaller than the atomic lattice constant .",
    "this can be readily understood on the basis of the domain wall profile shown in fig .",
    "[ tnh ] , where the components of the magnetization @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are defined within any arbitrarily small interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "likewise , the density of discretization points in simulation studies can be arbitrarily high .",
    "choosing too small cell sizes is normally a waste of computational resources , but there is no fundamental criterion that poses an obstacle .",
    "having outlined the importance of exchange lengths as well as the role of the discretization cell size and the fundamental assumptions of micromagnetism , we can now investigate how systematic and numerical errors emerge in the case of strongly inhomogeneous structures , _",
    "i.e. _ , when a significant inhomogeneity extends over a scale smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "an inhomogeneity can be defined as significant if the magnetization changes its direction by at least 90@xmath38 .",
    "practical cases of strongly inhomogeneous magnetic structures include the following situations :    * if the system is in a non - equilibrium state , _",
    "e.g. _ , when a domain structure is suddenly exposed to a strong external field , the conditions used to derive @xmath60 do not apply , and the domain wall width can become significantly smaller . in this context , the velocity - dependent compression of field - driven domain walls and the resulting increase of exchange energy have been used by dring to define the domain wall mass @xcite . *",
    "the exchange length only plays a role if the ferromagnet can be considered as homogeneous , which is the case for or a single - crystalline material or for an amorphous alloy with sufficiently small phases .",
    "granular composite magnets with strongly different anisotropies and exchange - coupled and phases can lead to magnetic inhomogeneities in the sub - nm range @xcite .",
    "* topological defects represent singularities of the magnetization where @xmath65 collapses to zero at a point around which the magnetization becomes maximally inhomogeneous . such bloch points or feldtkeller singularities @xcite can play a decisive role in magnetic switching processes @xcite . the assumption ( [ small - ang ] ) does not hold in these cases , rendering such structures a significant problem for micromagnetic simulations .",
    "singularities like bloch points are not unusual in continuum theories .",
    "a well - known example is the laminar flow of an incompressible liquid around a sharp corner , like a @xmath66 edge in a vessel .",
    "this results in a divergence of the flow velocity near the edge , which is only calculated correctly if the discretization mesh is fine enough ( see , _ e.g. _ , p.  456 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the image displays an example of the micromagnetic structure in the vicinity of a bloch point .",
    "such point singularities in the three - dimensional vector field @xmath2 generate highly frustrated and strongly inhomogeneous regions . in the center of the bloch point , no direction of the magnetization can be defined .",
    "each subset of the magnetization field defined on the surface of a small sphere containing the bloch point fills the entire directional space , _ i.e. _ , it contains at least one magnetization vector pointing in any chosen direction.,width=264 ]    the usual way of dealing with such singularities in simulation studies ( while remaining in the framework of the continuum theory ) is an extrapolation of the computed values to infinite discretization density .",
    "the convergence rate and the limiting value can thereby be determined as the cells become smaller . in this context",
    "it is irrelevant whether the singularity is real in a physical sense .",
    "obviously the velocity of the molecules in a liquid flowing around a corner does not really diverge , and the exchange energy density in a bloch point is not infinite .",
    "the occurrence of such singularities indicates that something is wrong with the fundamental assumptions of the model : a real liquid is not completely incompressible , a corner is not perfectly sharp , and neighboring atomic magnetic moments may sometimes be significantly misaligned .",
    "nevertheless , if the continuum theory yields singularities , the computational task consists in providing solutions of these problematic regions as accurately as possible , while the scientific task consists in evaluating the validity of the theory and the underlying assumptions .",
    "it is noteworthy that such singularities in continuum theories never affect the system in a  catastrophic \" way , meaning that the overall result remains correct . in the case of a bloch point , _",
    "e.g. _ , the total energy is finite , in spite of the divergence of the exchange energy density .",
    "the energy required to switch a vortex core is equal to the energy needed to generate a bloch point . according to analytic theory , the value of this energy is @xmath67 ( see text ) .",
    "numerical simulations systematically underestimate this switching energy , even if the cell size @xmath68 is well below the exchange length @xmath54 .",
    "however , an extrapolation to zero cell size reconciles the results , yielding perfect agreement with analytic theory .",
    "this is confirmed for different magnetic materials ( from ref.@xcite).,width=264 ]    an example of the method of extrapolating results obtained with different discretization densities is shown in fig .",
    "[ bp - nrg - fig ] , where the threshold energy required to initiate a vortex core reversal is determined . only by using this method , an almost perfect agreement with theoretical predictions",
    "could recently be obtained in micromagnetic simulation of vortex core switching processes . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite the switching of a vortex core in a thin - film element requires the formation of a bloch point traversing the sample along the film thickness .",
    "the analytic value of the energy @xmath69 of a bloch point in a thin - film element of thickness @xmath70 has been calculated analytically , yielding @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath25 is the exchange constant .",
    "the universality of this result is shown in fig .",
    "[ bp - nrg - fig ] , where the switching energy was calculated for different materials .",
    "details on the micromagnetic problem , the sample size and shape and the physical conclusions of this result are summarized in ref .",
    "note that without the extrapolation , the computed switching energy barrier is significantly underestimated  even when the cell size is well below the exchange length .",
    "this is typical for singularities , where the convergence rate , _",
    "i.e. _ , the amount by which the numeric error diminishes with increasing discretization density , is significantly lower than in the absence of singularities , cf . , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  @xcite .",
    "the singular behavior discussed in the previous section and the smooth transition within a 180@xmath38 wall ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ tnh ] ) can be considered as two limiting cases : in the case of a bloch point treated within the framework of micromagnetism , the magnetization changes its direction by 180@xmath38 inside an infinitely small volume element @xmath72 , while in the case of a bloch _ wall _ the 180@xmath38 transition occurs smoothly over a distance in the order of @xmath73 .",
    "the mesoscopic region between those limiting cases leads to numerical and fundamental difficulties that unfold as the inhomogeneity of a micromagnetic structure becomes more pronounced .",
    "these problems are exclusively connected to the exchange interaction , since it is the only micromagnetic term containing the assumption of small - angle interatomic variations of magnetic moments according to eq .",
    "( [ small - ang ] ) .    a simple spin spiral of periodicity @xmath74 serves as a model system to study the behavior of numerical and systematic errors occurring when the exchange energy of an increasingly homogeneous structure are calculated .",
    "the direction in which the spin spiral is oriented is irrelevant , but it is the same for the entire three - dimensional sample .",
    "this does not represent an equilibrium arrangement . as was done , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structure is artificially imposed in order to monitor the differences between numerical and analytic results.,width=264 ]    in order to simplify the analysis of gradually increasing inhomogeneities , we consider a spin spiral rather than the usual @xmath75 profile of the one - dimensional domain wall . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tnh ] , a spin spiral of wave length @xmath54 is very similar to the profile of a domain wall of width @xmath51 near the center of the domain wall .",

    "moreover , the highest - energy case of antiparallel magnetic moments in eq .",

    "is derived from classic analytic theory and can serve as a reference to determine the accuracy of the numerically computed exchange energy density . for a detailed comparison of various effects emerging as @xmath74 decreases ,",
    "we compare three values of the energy density :    1 .",
    "the analytic value @xmath84 is the exact solution of the micromagnetic equation ( [ exc - c ] ) , which can be calculated irrespective of the validity of the approximations and assumptions on which micromagnetic theory is based .",

    "3 .   the heisenberg - term @xmath86 is the value of the exchange energy density calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ hei ] ) .",
    "although the value is calculated numerically , this term is not affected by discretization error since no interpolation scheme is used .",
    "this term is calculated for different crystalline structures , and in some cases we extend the interaction to include the contribution of atomic moments located within a shell much larger than the nearest - neighbor approximation .",
    "the evolution of these three energy terms as a function of @xmath74 allows to discriminate between numerical and model - related errors and quantify the impact of these errors .",
    "we use our micromagnetic code tetramag to evaluate the exchange energy density for different cell sizes @xmath68 and discard the regions near the boundary to ensure that the results are not influenced by finite - size effects . in our case , the exchange field is calculated with standard fem techniques , as described in ref .",
