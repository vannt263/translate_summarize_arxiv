    "for @xmath0-cnf formulas many experiments have shown a very swift transition between satisfiability and unsatisfiability as the ratio @xmath7 of the number of clauses over the number of variables is varied .",
    "that is , there exists @xmath8 , a critical value of @xmath7 , such that if @xmath9 then the formula is almost surely satisfiable and if if @xmath10 then the formula is almost surely unsatisfiable .",
    "most of the papers investigating this phase transition are directed towards obtaining approximate estimates of its location .",
    "for instance for @xmath11-sat , for an observed sharp threshold of about @xmath12 the best lower bound is @xmath13 @xcite and tight upper bounds have been successively obtained , 4.601 @xcite , 4.596 @xcite and finally 4.506 @xcite . in 1999 , friedgut proposed a new and fruitful approach . in a remarkable paper @xcite , with an appendix by bourgain , he developed a general sharp threshold criterion for monotone subsets of the hypercube . in using this criterion he proved that @xmath0-sat @xcite and ( in collaboration with achlioptas ) @xmath0-col @xcite exhibit a sharp threshold . in @xcite creignou and daud applied this criterion to the @xmath0-xor - sat problem ( in which the usual  or \" is replaced by the  exclusive or \" ) .",
    "thus , they proved the existence of a sharp threshold phenomenon for @xmath0-xor - sat , @xmath2 , without specifying its location .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove that the phase transition for @xmath0-xor - sat occurs as the number of clauses is proportional to the number of variables and more precisely to provide approximate estimates of its location . in section [ lower bound section ]",
    "we give a lower bound and in section [ upper bound section ] an upper bound .",
    "our results rely first on the sharpness of the threshold established in @xcite ( see section [ definitions section ] ) and second on the handy translation of our problem in terms of random matrices ( see section [ random matrices section ] ) .",
    "these theoretical results are supplemented with experiments in section [ experiments section ] .",
    "throughout the paper @xmath0 will denote an integer equal to or greater than @xmath11 . a _ @xmath0-xor - clause _ ( or shortly a _ @xmath0-equation _ ) , @xmath14 , is a linear equation over the finite field @xmath1 using exactly @xmath0 variables , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "a _ @xmath0-xor - formula _ ( or shortly a _ @xmath0-system _ ) is a conjunction of distinct @xmath0-xor - clauses .",
    "a _ truth assignment _ @xmath17 is a mapping that assigns @xmath18 or @xmath19 to each variable in its domain , it satisfies an xor - clause @xmath20   iff @xmath21 and it satisfies a formula @xmath22 iff it satisfies every clause in @xmath22 .",
    "+ we will denote by @xmath23 ( or shortly sat ) the property for a @xmath0-xor - formula of being satisfiable ( or equivalently the property for a @xmath0-system of being consistent ) and by unsat the property of being unsatisfiable .",
    "the property unsat is monotone increasing .",
    "+ throughout the paper we reserve @xmath24 for the number of variables ( @xmath25 denotes the set of variables ) .",
    "there are @xmath26 different @xmath0-xor - clauses over @xmath24 variables .",
    "we consider the random formula obtained by choosing uniformly , independently and with replacement @xmath27 clauses from the @xmath28 possible @xmath0-clauses .",
    "this defines a probability space of @xmath0-xor - formulas consisting of all ordered sets of @xmath27 clauses , not necessarily distinct , with @xmath0 distinct variables , each over a set of boolean variables , each set of clauses having the same probability .",
    "this probability space is denoted by @xmath29 , the associated probability is the uniform law :    @xmath30 we are interested in estimating the probability that a formula drawn at random from @xmath31 is satisfiable , that is in estimating @xmath32 .",
    "our model for producing a random formula relates to the model in which each of the possible clauses is chosen independently with probability @xmath33 in the same way @xmath34 relates to @xmath35 in random graph theory . in most investigations on properties of random subgraphs of the complete graph on @xmath24 vertices , these two models are practically interchangeable , provided the number , @xmath27 , of edges be close to @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite the first two authors proved",
    "that when each clauses is chosen with probability @xmath33 then @xmath23 exhibits a sharp threshold for @xmath2 .",
    "they also noted that the transition occurs when @xmath37 .",
    "thus in the context of random formula these results are still valid in our model ( provided @xmath38 ) , they can be expressed as :    @xcite[sharp threshold thm ]    for every @xmath2 there exists a function @xmath39 such that : for every @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    we are going to prove that this sharp threshold behavior occurs as the number of clauses is proportional to the number of variables of formulas and more precisely we are going to provide lower and upper bounds for @xmath43 .",
    "since we know from theorem [ sharp threshold thm ] that @xmath44 , we can and we will suppose in the sequel that @xmath45 . + as mentioned in @xcite , though there is a swift transition of probability of satisfiability it is still feasible that the critical value @xmath43 does not converge to any given value .",
    "however , one can define @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus , @xmath48 ( respectively , @xmath49 ) is the least ( greatest ) real number such that if @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) then the probability of a @xmath0-xor - formula with @xmath24 variables and @xmath52 clauses being satisfiable converges to @xmath18 ( to @xmath19 ) as @xmath24 tends to infinity ; hence @xmath53 and experiments suggest strongly ( see section [ experiments section ] ) that equality holds .    in a first step ( section [ random matrices section ] ) we will reduce our problem to the study of the rank of random sparse matrices over @xmath1 .",
    "then , we will give a lower bound ( section [ lower bound section ] ) and an upper bound ( section [ upper bound section ] ) for the threshold .    at last , @xmath54 will denote the well - known entropy function , @xmath55",
    "the aim of this section is to express @xmath32 in terms of random matrices .",
    "we will first use a technique related to the harmonic mean formula and publicized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this technique provides a simple expression for the number of satisfiable systems and can be described by a bipartite graph @xmath56 formed by @xmath57 ( the set of all assignments @xmath58 ) as the first part of vertices and @xmath29 ( the set of all systems s ) as the second part .",
    "there is an edge @xmath59 in @xmath56 if the assignment @xmath17 satisfies the system @xmath60 .",
    "the degree of every assignment @xmath17 is equal to @xmath61 and for every system @xmath60 the degree @xmath62 of @xmath60 is the number of distinct assignments satisfying @xmath60 .",
    "the number of satisfiable @xmath0-systems is thus given by @xmath63 as there is a one - to - one correspondence from the set of linear systems satisfied by some fixed assignment @xmath64 onto the set @xmath65 of homogeneous linear systems , we get : @xmath66 from this simple expression we get the following theorem .    [ matrix theorem ] let @xmath67 denote the number of vectors in the kernel of the transpose of @xmath68 , then providing @xmath68 be chosen uniformly in the set @xmath69 of boolean @xmath70 matrices with exactly @xmath0 units in each row : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the probability that a matrix from @xmath73 is of rank @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denotes the expectation .    from our preliminary work",
    "we have : @xmath76    but @xmath77 and    @xmath78 , as @xmath79 we get : @xmath80    the second equality is justified by the following fact :    @xmath81    we will see that this result leads to two key facts , proposition [ key fact 1 ] and proposition [ matrix corollary ] , which enable us to give tight bounds for the threshold .",
    "by theorem [ matrix theorem ] and jensen s inequality we have : @xmath82 thus , we get the first key fact :    [ key fact 1 ] @xmath83    a first lower bound for the threshold of @xmath0-xor - sat can be derived from the following result    [ lower bound thm ] let @xmath84 denote the minimum over @xmath85 $ ] of the function @xmath86 then for any @xmath87    from maple s estimates for @xmath84 we get the following bounds : @xmath88    to prove theorem [ lower bound thm ] we first show that the behavior of @xmath89 is given by the one of the following quantity :    @xmath90    [ e(y ) lemma ] @xmath91    let us consider @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the sum of indicator variables : @xmath94 by symmetry , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is any vector of weight @xmath97 . + for each @xmath98 , consider the subset @xmath99 of @xmath100 formed by the indexes of the unit coordinates of @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath96 is in the kernel of @xmath68 if and only if each row of the submatrix of @xmath68 formed by the @xmath97 columns whose indexes are in @xmath99 has an even number @xmath60 of unit coefficients .",
    "thus , we have @xmath101 possible rows for a matrix @xmath68 in @xmath102 such that @xmath103 , and we deduce :    @xmath104 therefore , @xmath105    as @xmath106 , the conclusion follows .",
    "this result shows that if we split @xmath107 in two then the proof of theorem [ lower bound thm ] follows from the two following claims :    [ claim1 ] if @xmath108 then @xmath109 , where @xmath110    [ claim2 ] if @xmath111 then @xmath112 , where @xmath113    these claims rely on asymptotical properties of sums of binomial coefficients and of the quantity @xmath114 .",
