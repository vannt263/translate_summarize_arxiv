    "these results demonstrate that the decay of the afterglow is achromatic in vri at least for the interval hdab 0.68.0 and in bvri for hdab 0.83.9 .",

    "the observed differs significantly from the value @xmath100 found by rhoads ( 1999 ) when fitting his numerical results , which predict a rather smooth transition .",
    "the more abrupt break may be due to the superposition of several effects , as the slowing of the jet and its sideways spread ( harrison et al .",

    "1 : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding colours are consistent with those for hdab 0.61.1 .",
    "the lack of substantial colour variations can be seen from the small scatter in the residuals of the best fit ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for comparison , for @xmath72 fixed at 1.0 we obtain @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 days and @xmath109 for a fit to the unaltered data points .",
    "since the errors of the @xmath110 s and of @xmath72 are correlated , fixing @xmath72 reduces the errors in the other parameters artificially .",
    "our fit to the light curve with @xmath111 allows us to predict the brightness of the ot at later times with some confidence that uncertainties in the shape of the light curve have been accounted for as far as possible .",
    "we predict an ot magnitude of @xmath112 on june 8 ( hdab 28.8 ) , when our br photometry was performed .",
    "fruchter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have reported detections with the hst - stis open ccd on june 8.1 and june 17.9 ( hdab 28.7 and 38.5 ) .",
    "assuming an @xmath38@xmath113 spectrum , they obtained @xmath114 and @xmath115 , corresponding to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "given the red sensitivity of the stis - ccd , these @xmath0 magnitudes are quite robust . we conclude that our june 8 result and the first of the hst detections are consistent with each other .    assuming that all photometry including the late data points is that of the decaying ot , we obtain nearly identical light curve parameters : @xmath118 ; @xmath119 .",
    "thus , all of the available photometry is consistent with the light curve of a pure ot .    the observed spectral index @xmath120 and the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions if the cooling break stays at wavelengths shorter than the visual band until hdab 8.0 .",
    "the slope of the electron injection spectrum then is @xmath123 in agreement with the conclusions drawn by harrison et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and stanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "figures 3a - c depict the late decay of the ot from an equivalent @xmath0-magnitude of 21.95 ( hdab 3.8 ) over 23.75 ( hdab 8.0 ) to  26.4 ( hdab 28.8 ) ( table 2 ) . down to the 5-@xmath4 thresholds for a detection at an arbitrary position ,",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 our images show no other object within 6  of the ot , besides the stars a , b , c , and d. the faint emission on june 8 at the ot position is more easily seen when the high - resolution image ( 0.1  pixels ) is slightly smoothed .",
    "figure 3d is an enhanced version of 3c , smoothed with a gaussian of 0.3  standard deviation and with star c psf - subtracted .",
    "while the emission appears to be slightly offset from the ot position by 0.4  and may signify an underlying object , the shift is within the statistical uncertainty expected for such a faint source .      although the light curve analysis does not require another light source in addition to the ot , such contribution can not be excluded .",
    "one possibility is that an underlying sn - event contributes to the june 1999 light level . taking the @xmath0-band light curve of sn1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "1998 , iwamoto et al . 1998 ) adjusted to @xmath126 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) one expects a peak magnitude of @xmath127 ( reddened 27.3 ) , just consistent with the upper limit of @xmath128 of the fit [ fitted flux relative to star a with r = 19.17 is @xmath129 . forcing the fit to use a peak value of 27.4 results in an increase in @xmath122 from 2.37 to 2.71 and a correlated decrease in @xmath72 from 0.94 to 0.60 .",
    "alternatively , the best - fit contribution by an underlying galaxy , which adds a constant to the late - time light curve , yields a upper limit of 27.6 ( 27.1 de - reddened )  [ flux relative to @xmath130 .",
    "the forced fit with the 3-@xmath4 upper limit requires @xmath122 and @xmath72 changes nearly identical to those of the corresponding sn fit .",
    "we note that many burst models do not require a sn event and that a host fainter than 27 mag presents no problem with the galaxy population responsible for grbs ( hogg & fruchter 1999 ) . fig .",
    "2 shows the fits obtained for the ot alone ( early data or all data ) and the forced fits with the ot and the 3-@xmath4 upper - limit sn and host contributions added : there is presently no way to distinguish between the three models , but the fact that the early and late ot light curve fits are so similar strongly suggests that we have only seen the ot .",
    "for @xmath131 ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ) and a standard cosmology with @xmath132kms@xmath133mpc@xmath133 and @xmath134 , the distance modulus is 45.2 .",
    "the de - reddened host magnitude @xmath135 then translates to a restframe @xmath136@xmath137 for a starburst spectrum similar to ngc4449 ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) and to @xmath136@xmath138 for a pure starburst spectrum .",
    "hence , the host is intrinsically faint if at z=1.62 . while one might be willing to place the burst at a larger @xmath139",
    ", there is a probable limit from the expected ly@xmath110-forest or lyman - continuum absorption .",
    "the lack of a pronounced depression at wavelengths longer than 3600 ( fig .",
    "1 ) limits the acceptable redshift to @xmath140 for ly@xmath110-forest and to @xmath141 for lyman - continuum absorption .",
    "the only brighter object possibly related to the ot is the one denoted e in fig .",
    "3d , 12  to the se . with a diameter of @xmath142 and its decidedly blue colour",
    "it may qualify as a starburst galaxy .",
    "its de - reddened magnitudes and colours are well within the range found for the hosts of other grbs and ots , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , assuming @xmath33 = 0.20 .",
    "the observed spectral flux distribution is typical of the uv spectrum of a starburst or irregular galaxy ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "if this is actually a galaxy at @xmath131 , it would be separated by at least 100 kpc from the ot .",
    "this would not be a problem if the grb progenitor were a low - mass system ejected from this galaxy ( fryer et al .",
    "the absence of an associated sn or host galaxy at the ot position would support such a scenario , while the suspected connection of long gamma - ray bursts with massive progenitors does not .",
    "the recent observations of the optical transient of strongly support the synchrotron model for gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the pre - break light curve and the @xmath146 optical flux distribution are consistent with the adiabatic cooling of relativistic electrons with an @xmath56 injection spectrum with @xmath147 .",
    "the steep late decline is a firm indicator of the presence of a slowing jet ( meszaros & rees 1999 , rhoads 1999 , sari , et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the light level on june 8 is quite consistent with being solely due to the transient , but contributions by either a sn with @xmath148 or a host with @xmath3 ( 3-@xmath4 upper limits ) can not be ruled out .",
    "if located at @xmath131 , the sn could have been nearly as bright as expected from appropriately scaling sn1998bw , while a starburst galaxy as the host would have @xmath136@xmath149 .",
    "proving the presence or absence of a host galaxy at the ot position or identifying fainter nearby candidates requires additional deep exposures .",
    "if ejection of the progenitor of grb990510 is considered a possibility , the blue extended object 12  east with de - reddened @xmath150 could be a host candidate .",
    "we thank the eso staff for the competent performance of part of the observations in too service mode and our referee , ralph wijers , for his helpful comments .",
