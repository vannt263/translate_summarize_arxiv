    "a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) of length @xmath6 on a periodic graph or lattice @xmath7 is a sequence of distinct vertices @xmath8 in @xmath7 such that each vertex is a nearest neighbour of its predecessor . in figure",
    "[ fig : saw ] a very long walk of @xmath9 steps is shown ( generated by a monte carlo algorithm @xcite ) .",
    "steps on the square lattice  courtesy of nathan clisby.,width=188 ]    consider now those saws starting at the centre of an @xmath10 rectangle and ending when they hit the boundary .",
    "we take the scaling limit of saw , at the critical point , in the usual way ( described , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath11 be the probability that a randomly chosen saw , in the scaling limit , hits the side of the rectangle before the end , and let @xmath12 be the probability that it hits the end before the side . in guttmann and kennedy @xcite the probability ratio @xmath13 was calculated , under the assumption that the scaling limit is describable by @xmath14 for a rectangle of aspect ratio @xmath15 with parameter @xmath16 where @xmath17 they found , asymptotically , @xmath18,\\ ] ] for @xmath19 where @xmath20 the exact result is given as the ratio of two integrals ( [ rat ] ) , and we give an outline of their calculation in the following section .    in this work , we have considered all @xmath21 rectangles of aspect ratio 2 of size @xmath22 up to @xmath23 and have generated all saw starting at the origin and ending on the boundary of the rectangles .",
    "we have also considered all @xmath24 rectangles of aspect ratio 10 of size @xmath25 up to @xmath26 .",
    "we have also developed a refined enumeration scheme in which the full hitting distribution is recorded ; we give the results here for rectangles of aspect ratio 2 .",
    "the relevant geometry is shown in figure  [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "we obtained separately the generating functions for saws starting at the centre of the rectangle and exiting at any prescribed point on its boundary .",
    "this has been compared to that calculated by conformal mapping , assuming that @xmath27 is the appropriate scaling limit .",
    "the data was generated using a transfer matrix formalism , utilising symmetry and similar techniques to minimise the computational complexity .",
    "details of the methods used are given in section [ series ] .",
    "in addition to the position of the end - points of the walks on the boundary , the length ( number of steps ) was also retained .    in @xcite",
    "a monte carlo study was made by kennedy , who compared certain random variables associated with saws in a half - plane with those predicted assuming that the scaling limit of saws is given by @xmath14 excellent agreement was found in a visual comparison of two graphical plots .",
    "our work differs in nature in that we predict a specific value of @xmath2 , assuming that the scaling limit of saws is given by @xmath28      let @xmath29 be a bounded , simply connected domain in the complex plane containing @xmath30 we are interested in paths in @xmath29 starting at @xmath31 and ending on the boundary of the domain .",
    "initially we will consider random walks , later self - avoiding walks .",
    "we can discretize the space with a lattice of lattice spacing @xmath32 in both the random walk case and the saw case we are then interested in the scaling limit @xmath33 for random walks the scaling limit is brownian motion , stopping when it hits the boundary of @xmath34 the distribution of the end - point is harmonic measure . if the domain boundary is piecewise smooth , then harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with respect to arc length along the boundary @xcite .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the density with respect to arc length ( often called the poisson kernel ) .",
    "if @xmath36 is a conformal map on @xmath29 that fixes the origin , and such that the boundary of @xmath37 is also piecewise smooth , then the conformal invariance of brownian motion implies that the density for harmonic measure on the boundary of @xmath37 is related to the boundary of @xmath29 by @xmath38 in the case of the saw , lawler , schramm , and werner @xcite predicted that the corresponding density of the probability measure @xmath39 transforms under conformal maps as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and the constant @xmath42 is required to ensure that @xmath43 is a probability density . if one starts the random walk or the saw at the centre of a disc , then the hitting density on the circle will be uniform .",
    "so the above equations determine the hitting density for any simply connected domain , by virtue of the riemann mapping theorem .",
    "simulations in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide strong support for the conjectured behaviour .",
    "( [ cisaw ] ) is correct for domains whose boundary consists only of vertical and horizontal line segments . for general domains",
    "there is a lattice effect that persists in the scaling limit that produces a factor that depends on the angle of the tangent to the boundary that must be included @xcite . )",
    "the solution of the problem for random walks by conformal maps is described in @xcite , where a conformal map from the unit disc to an @xmath44 rectangle is given by the schwarz - christoffel formula .",
    "our approach also uses conformal maps , but we instead use a map between the upper half - plane and a rectangle , where the mapping is again given by a schwarz - christoffel transformation . for @xmath45 let @xmath46 @xmath47 is a schwarz - christoffel transformation that maps the upper half plane to a rectangle .",
    "the rectangle has one edge along the real axis and @xmath31 is a midpoint of this side .",
    "so the corners can be written as @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the length of the horizontal and vertical edges , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath51    so @xmath52 we note that @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . by dilation",
    "invariance we only need concern ourselves with the aspect ratio @xmath55 so given an aspect ratio @xmath56 , we have to find @xmath57 such that    @xmath58    from the properties of elliptic integrals , it follows @xcite that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the jacobi theta function .",
    "evaluating this in one s favourite algebraic package gives the required value of @xmath57 for any @xmath61 instantly .",
    "alternatively , we note that for an aspect ratio of 10 , @xmath57 is very close to 1 .",
    "we can achieve very high accuracy by expanding the ratio of the above integrals around @xmath62 , and find @xmath63 solving this numerically for @xmath64 gives @xmath65 to leading order one obtains @xmath66 which for @xmath64 gives 19 digit accuracy .",
    "an alternative approach is to note that @xmath67 so that when @xmath68 one has @xmath69 here @xmath70 are _ singular moduli , _ that is , elliptic moduli for which @xmath71 from a table of singular moduli , for example @xcite , one finds for @xmath64 that @xmath72 for aspect ratio @xmath73 one finds @xmath74    these considerations establish @xmath75 a parameter of the conformal map , both directly and asymptotically . to proceed",
    "further we need to determine the behaviour of the hitting density of paths from the origin to the boundary of the rectangle .",
    "first , note that the preimage of the center of the rectangle will , by symmetry , be on the imaginary axis , so write it as @xmath76 in @xcite geometrical arguments are given to show that @xmath77 an alternative algebraic derivation is the following : from the schwarz - christoffel mapping @xmath78 set @xmath79 giving @xmath80 this integral is an ( incomplete ) elliptic integral of the second kind , from which follows @xmath81    as shown in @xcite , for both the random walk and the saw in the half plane starting at @xmath82 the ( unnormalized ) hitting density along the real axis is @xmath83 .",
    "hence the hitting density @xmath84 for walks in a rectangle starting at the center is @xmath85    the ratio of probabilities of a walk first hitting an end of the rectangle to that of a walk first hitting a side is just the ratio of the integral of the hitting density @xmath39 along a vertical edge to the integral along a horizontal edge , @xmath86 by a change of variable , setting @xmath87 in the denominator and @xmath88 in the numerator , and recalling that @xmath89 the ratio of probabilities of a first hit on the vertical side to a first hit on the horizontal side , @xmath90 , is @xmath91 these integrals can not be solved in closed form .",
    "both mathematica and maple can be used to evaluate them numerically to any reasonable accuracy .",
    "however for our purposes it would be useful to have a reasonably accurate asymptotic representation .",
    "we will calculate the leading order and first correction term in the quotient ( [ rat ] ) where @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 with @xmath94 here @xmath57 is related to the aspect ratio @xmath56 of a rectangle by ( [ alfa ] ) .",
    "consider the numerator first .",
    "one has @xmath95 now , since @xmath96 with @xmath97 @xmath98 so @xmath99 @xmath100 set @xmath101 then @xmath102 and @xmath103^{\\frac{b-1}{2 } } dt - \\frac{bc}{2 } \\cdot \\int_0 ^ 1 ( 1 + 2t)[t(1-t)]^{\\frac{b-1}{2 } } dt\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ = & \\left ( 1+\\frac{c(b-1)}{4 } \\right ) \\left ( ( \\alpha-1)^b \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi } \\cdot \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{b}{2 } \\right ) } { 2^{b+1 } \\cdot \\gamma \\left ( 1+\\frac{b}{2 } \\right ) } ( 1+\\frac{b-1}{4}c)- ( \\alpha-1)^{b+1 } \\frac{b \\cdot \\sqrt{\\pi } \\cdot \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{b}{2 } \\right ) } { 2^{b+1 } \\cdot \\gamma \\left ( 1+\\frac{b}{2 } \\right ) } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ = & ( \\alpha-1)^b \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi } \\cdot \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{b}{2 } \\right ) } { 2^{b+1 } \\cdot \\gamma \\left ( 1+\\frac{b}{2 } \\right ) } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{(b+1)}{2}(\\alpha-1)\\right ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , consider the denominator : @xmath104^{(b-1)/2 } du\\ ] ] again , let @xmath93 where @xmath94 one has @xmath105 and @xmath106 both to first order in @xmath107 so with @xmath108 @xmath109 where @xmath110^{(b-1)/2 } dx.\\ ] ] ( note that the first argument refers to the power of @xmath111 only , not the other occurrences of @xmath112 ) .",
    "next , we take the mellin transform @xmath113 so the mellin transform of @xmath114 is @xmath115 @xmath116 hence the inverse transform is @xmath117 where @xmath118 closing the contour to the left , as we want a small @xmath119 expansion , we see there are poles coming from the gamma functions .",
    "the first occurs at @xmath120 and the second at @xmath121 taking the residue at the poles we get @xmath122 another term comes from @xmath123 and this gives a term @xmath124 we can eliminate the hypergeometric functions , as they can be expressed in terms of gamma functions , and then simplified . in this way we obtain @xmath125.\\ ] ]    we can write the ratio @xmath126 = \\ ] ] @xmath127 here we have used the asymptotic expansion ( [ alfa ] ) of @xmath128 as an expansion in @xmath75 and the parameters introduced above are @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132    then @xmath133,\\ ] ] for @xmath134    for @xmath64 and @xmath135 the leading term gives 4 significant digits accuracy ( where we are comparing to the value obtained by numerical integration with 50 digit accuracy ) , while including the next terms gives 8 significant digits .",
    "this is more than sufficient for our purpose here .",
    "however for @xmath136 ( with the same value of @xmath112 ) the expansion is much more slowly convergent , and the above expression provides the result to an accuracy of merely 1 part in 20 . while we could calculate further terms in the asymptotic expansion , we prefer to simply evaluate the integral expression ( [ rat ] ) numerically .",
    "we now use these results to calculate the value of @xmath112 characterising the scaling limit of saws .",
    "we do this by generating all saws in a rectangle of given aspect ratio @xmath56 , centred at the origin , and of size @xmath137 for @xmath138 where @xmath139 refers to the largest possible rectangle we can use given our computer resources .    in the next section we describe the efficient generation of these saws , using transfer matrices and efficient use of symmetry and the elimination of unnecessary starting points . in the following section we analyse the data thus produced , by calculating and extrapolating the ratio @xmath140 for two representative values of @xmath141 which were @xmath136 and @xmath142 from these estimates of @xmath143 we use the asymptotic expansion above to estimate @xmath16 in the case of aspect ration 10 , while for @xmath136 the comparison is made with numerical integration values from ( [ rat ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we can compare the hitting density distribution function , as calculated from our largest rectangle , to that predicted in the scaling limit . with @xmath144 and for rectangles of aspect ratio 2 , it will be seen that the two distribution functions are almost indistinguishable .",
    "we first describe the computation of the generating functions of a saw starting at the centre of the strip and terminating , respectively , the first time it hits either one of the rectangle s two short sides , or one of its two long sides . the rectangle is supposed oriented so that the short sides are horizontal and the long sides vertical .    as usual in enumeration studies the basic ingredient is a transfer matrix acting on an appropriate set of states .",
    "each state comes with a weight , which is a polynomial with integer coefficients in a variable @xmath145 that is interpreted as the fugacity for one step of the saw . the transfer matrix is maximally decomposed as a product of elementary matrices that each adds a small piece ( a vertex and its adjacent half - edges ) to the lattice being constructed .",
    "the states contain information about how the uppermost row of half - edges are connected among themselves , or to the boundary of the rectangle , or to the centre point , through pieces of the partially built saw .",
    "this information  and the action of the elementary matrices on the states  must be carefully devised so that :    1 .",
    "a single saw going from the centre to the boundary of the rectangle is constructed ; 2 .",
    "the two desired generating functions , describing respectively the hitting of the short and long sides of the rectangle , can be disentangled ; 3 .",
    "no superfluous information is stored .",
    "points 1 and 2 are essential for the correctness of the algorithm , whereas 3 is only a matter of efficiency . it can not be excluded that the precise procedure described below can be shown in the future not to be optimal , in the sense that a variant algorithm can be constructed that uses fewer states to achieve the goals 1 and 2 .",
    "we consider an @xmath10 rectangle , with @xmath146 and @xmath147 even ( so that the centre of the rectangle coincides with a vertex ) , and @xmath148 ( the transfer matrix then propagates upwards ) .",
    "the states contain information about the connectivities of the @xmath6 uppermost half - edges , labelled @xmath149 from left to right , of the partially constructed lattice .",
    "when a row of the lattice is completed , @xmath150 and all half - edges are vertical . at stages where a row is under construction",
    ", @xmath151 and one of the half - edges is horizontal .",
    "the lattice is constructed  through the action of the elementary matrices ",
    "row by row , completing the rows from left to right .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : tm ] .",
    "each half - edge can be connected to another half - edge , or be in one of the following configurations :    1 .",
    "empty , meaning that it is not covered by the saw ; 2 .",
    "side , when it is connected through the saw to the left or right boundary of the rectangle ; 3 .",
    "bottom , when its is connected to the bottom ( or top ) boundary of the rectangle ; 4 .",
    "centre , when it is connected to the centre point .",
    "in addition the system as a whole can be in the following configurations when the saw has been completed before the lattice has been completely built :    1 .",
    "exit_lr when the saw went from the centre point to the left or right boundary ; 2 .",
    "exit_bt when it went to the bottom or top boundary .",
    "being in one of those exit configurations implies that all the half - edges must be empty and remain so until completion of the lattice . to describe such states",
    "it is therefore sufficient to use just @xmath152 label containing the exit status ( exit_lr or exit_bt ) .    imposing the correct constraints throughout the construction of the lattice ( see below )",
    "will imply that once the lattice has been completed only the two exit states carry a non - zero weight .",
    "these two weights are precisely the desired generating functions .",

    ", the system is in a superposition of the completely empty state ( with weight @xmath153 ) , and each of the @xmath6 states where one of the @xmath150 half - edges carries the @xmath154 label ( with weight @xmath145 ) and the others are empty .",
    "note that a valid state can not have more than one half - edge labelled either bottom or side , since we aim at constructing a saw that touches the boundary in only one single point .",
    "after a row of the lattice has been completed the following operation , called left in figure  [ fig : tm ] , adds a horizontal half - edge touching the left boundary of the rectangle . if the system is already in an exit state it remains so and with the same weight .",
    "otherwise the labels are shifted one unit to the right to make place for that of the horizontal half - edge .",
    "the latter can either be empty or , if no other bottom or side label exists , be set to side in which case the weight is multiplied by @xmath145 to take account for the extra monomer .",
    "the subsequent operations within the row are of the type bulk .",
    "the elementary matrix now acts on two labels , describing the half - edges coming from west and south in the incoming state , and which after the time evolution describe the half - edges going towards north and east in the outgoing state .",
    "an exit state is treated as before . in all other cases",
    "we must ensure that the bulk vertex is adjacent to either two or four occupied edges .",
    "thus , if both incoming labels are empty , the outgoing labels can be empty as well , or mutually connected with an extra weight @xmath155 .",
    "if only one incoming label is empty , the other can go straight through the vertex or make a turn , in both cases with weight @xmath145 .",
    "finally , if neither of the incoming labels is empty there is a rather large number of possibilities :    1 .",
    "if both labels describe connectivities to other half - edges ( i.e. , neither is equal to one of the special labels empty , side , bottom or centre described above ) , their respective partner half - edges must be mutually connected .",
    "however , if the connection is among the two incoming half - edges themselves , the state must be discarded , since the saw is not allowed to form a closed loop .",
    "if one of the labels is special , the partner of the non - special label becomes equal to the special label .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "if both incoming labels are special , we have the opportunity of creating an exit state . but first a number of precautions must be taken : 1 .",
    "all the remaining labels in the state need to be empty , otherwise the state must be discarded .",
    "one of the incoming labels must be centre and the other either side or bottom ( otherwise discard the state ) .",
    "the latter label then determines whether the exit state is exit_lr or exit_bt .    in all those cases",
    "the two outgoing labels will be empty and the weight coincides with that of the incoming state .    to complete a row we use the operation right .",
    "the elementary matrix acts on the rightmost label , describing the half - edge that will touch the right boundary of the rectangle .",
    "the action on exit states is as usual .",
    "if the incoming label is empty the state is kept as it is .",
    "otherwise the rightmost half - edge will be occupied , and we must first make sure that there is not already a label which is side or bottom ( otherwise discard the state ) .",
    "next , if the incoming label is centre we obtain an exit_lr exit state provided that the remainder of the half - edges are empty . otherwise , if the incoming half - edge is connected to another half - edge , the latter will be marked by a side label to signify the hitting of the right boundary of the rectangle .",
    "after these considerations the rightmost label is deleted , since we have now completed a row of the lattice and only @xmath156 labels are required .",
    "special care must be taken when attaining the centre point .",
    "this is achieved by applying the operation centre . as in the bulk case",
    "the action is on two labels , but while in the former case the vertex had degree two or four , the number of occupied adjacent edges must now be one , since the saw emanates from the centre point .",
    "thus , if both incoming labels are empty we produce two outgoing states with one of the outgoing labels being centre and the other empty ( with a weight @xmath145 ) .",
    "states with two occupied ingoing labels must be discarded . and",
    "finally , for states with one ingoing label being empty and the other occupied there are a number of possibilities :    1 .",
    "if the occupied incoming half - edge is connected to another half - edge , the latter acquires the centre label .",
    "otherwise the occupied incoming half - edge is of the type side or bottom , and we end up in an exit state ( provided the remainder of the system is empty ) .",
    "it remains to describe how to finish the rectangle after building the last row .",
    "each half - edge must now be subjected to the operation top in order to implement the top boundary of the rectangle .",
    "the corresponding elementary matrix acts on a single label ( and is in fact very similar to the operation right described above ) .",
    "if that label is empty the state is unchanged .",
    "if it is side or bottom the state is discarded .",
    "if it is connected to another half - edge , the latter acquires the bottom label ( which is ill - named in this case , since it is the top boundary of the rectangle which is being touched ) . and finally , if the incoming label is centre we end up in the exit_bt state ( provided the remainder of the system is empty ) .    from a practical point of view , all the labels used to describe a state can be coded on short integers ( say , of the char type in c ) and the coding of the entire state of @xmath6 half - edges is then an array of characters .",
    "the handling of incoming and outgoing states is then conveniently and efficiently done by employing standard hashing techniques .",
    "the integer coefficients entering the weights will obviously become very large for even a moderately - sized system , but this is easily dealt with by using modular arithmetic , i.e. , repeating the entire computation modulo various primes and reconstituting the results from the chinese remainder theorem .",
    "our results for the generating functions with various aspect ratios are so lengthy that it makes little sense to have all them all appear in print",
    ". however , the complete results are available in electronic form as supplementary material to this paper . for the convenience of the readers who wish to check explicitly the example of the @xmath157 rectangle shown in figure  [ fig : tm ] we give the results for that case . for the hitting of the long sides of the rectangle we find @xmath158 while for the hitting of the short sides we have @xmath159    note that all the coefficients in this example are even .",
    "this is generally true and due to the symmetries of the rectangle .",
    "explicitly , the mirror symmetry with respect to a horizontal ( resp .",
    "vertical ) line going through the centre point induces a bijection between the saws that hit the bottom ( resp",
    ".  left ) boundary and those that hit the top ( resp .",
    "right ) boundary .",
    "we can take advantage of those symmetries to make a more efficient version of the algorithm .",
    "namely , if we impose the restriction that all the half - edges incident on the bottom and left boundaries be empty , only the saws hitting the right and top boundaries will be counted .",
    "this means that the required generating functions are simply divided by a factor of two .",
    "the reason that we have imposed the constraint on the left boundary rather than the right , and on the bottom boundary rather than the top , is that the left and bottom boundaries are those encountered earliest in the time evolution of figure  [ fig : tm ] .",
    "imposing the constraints early on will most efficiently curb the proliferation of unnecessary states .",
    ".maximum number of states in the transfer matrix algorithm for an @xmath10 rectangle with @xmath160 . here",
    "@xmath161 ( resp .",
    "@xmath162 ) refers to the time evolution before ( resp .",
    "after ) the addition of the centre point .",
    "the corresponding primed quantities , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , are for the improved algorithm that exploits reflection symmetries . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the need to register the exit coordinate obviously increases the number of states used in the computation",
    ". one might expect that roughly @xmath165 times more states would be needed .",
    "fortunately , the additional constraints imposed on the boundary half - edges ameliorates the situation somewhat .",
