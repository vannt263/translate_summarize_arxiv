    "coherent wave scattering effects in disordered media display an extraordinary variety of phenomena which are of both fundamental and practical concern .  of particular interest",
    "is that coherent wave scattering shows a broad universality which makes possible a qualitatively similar description for different types of wave excitation in a variety of media . these range , as an illustration , from enhancement of light scattering off the lunar regolith and the rings of saturn on the one hand @xcite , to explanation of peculiarities in propagation of waves in the solid earth on the other @xcite .",
    "in addition , coherent wave scattering is a useful technique for diagnosing the average properties of scatterers in turbid media , and for assessing relatively thin surface layers in biological and mechanical materials @xcite . the propagation of light waves in natural photonic materials such as opal gives the valuable semiprecious gemstone its highly valued beauty . of fundamental scientific importance",
    ", coherent wave scattering was first recognized by anderson anderson in the context of interference of electron wave scattering in conductors .",
    "as the scattering mean free path decreases and becomes shorter than a characteristic length on the order of the wavelength , wave diffusion slows as a result of wave interference .",
    "the limiting case where diffusion ceases is called strong localization , where the propagating wave becomes spatially localized inside the medium . for electromagnetic radiation sheng , lagtig , two recent reports of strong localization",
    "have been made , one in the optical regime @xcite , and the other for microwave radiation @xcite .",
    "a major long - term and fundamental goal of the research presented here , and of other researchers in the field , is to attain strong localization of light , but in an ultracold atomic vapor .",
    "quite recently , coherent multiple light scattering has been observed in ultracold atomic gases , which form a unique and flexible medium for fundamental studies and practical applications labeyrie1,labeyrie2,kulatunga1,bidel . in all cases ,",
    "the essential physical mechanisms are due to interferences in multiple wave scattering from the components of the medium ; under certain not very stringent conditions the interferences survive configuration averaging , thus generating macroscopic observables .",
    "first observations and initial explanations for electromagnetic radiation were of the so - called coherent backscattering ( cbs ) cone in disordered media @xcite . for radiation incident on a diffusive medium ,",
    "the effect manifests itself as a spatially narrow ( @xmath51 mrad ) cusp - shaped intensity enhancement in the nearly backwards direction @xcite . as electromagnetic waves",
    "are not scalar , the detailed shape and size of the enhancement depends on the polarization of the incident and the detected light .",
    "nevertheless , for classical radiation scattering from a @xmath6 @xmath7 atomic transition , the largest possible interferometric enhancement is to increase the intensity by a factor of two .    atomic gases , because they have exceptionally high - q resonances , and because the light scattering properties may be readily modified by light polarization or intensity , atomic density , and applied external fields , represent an interesting and flexible medium in which to study the role of multiple scattering .",
    "however , to achieve the full potential of atomic scatterers as a practical medium for such studies , it is necessary to significantly cool the atoms , in order to suppress the dephasing effects of atomic motion .",
    "coherent backscattering interference has , in fact , been measured in @xmath0rb @xcite and sr @xcite , and quite successfully modeled for resonant and near - resonant scattering as well @xcite .",
    "measurements have also been made of the magnetic field dependence of the coherent backscattering line shape @xcite , and of the time - dependence , for a particular geometry , of light scattered in the coherent scattering regime @xcite .",
    "however , there remains a significant range of physical parameters associated with the various processes which have not yet been fully explored .  among these",
    "are the influence of light intensity , nonzero ground state multipoles such as alignment or orientation , cooperative multi - atom scattering associated with higher atomic density , and more general geometries for time - dependent studies .  in the present report we concentrate attention on another variable , that being the dependence of the coherent backscattering enhancement on detuning of the probe beam from exact resonance .",
    "it is clear that non - resonant excitation of the atomic sample results in a smaller optical depth ( and associated larger transport mean free path ) of the medium @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical and experimental results presented here reveal that other more subtle effects , including far - off - resonance optical transitions , heating of the vapor by multiple light scattering and self - magnetization of the vapor during the cbs phase , can have significant effects on the spectral variation of the cbs enhancement . in the following sections we first present an overview of the physical system , including how atomic samples are prepared and characterized and a brief review of measurements of coherent backscattering from an atomic vapor .",
    "this is followed by a summary of the approach to simulate coherent multiple scattering in an ultracold atomic gas .",
    "we then present our experimental and theoretical results , with focus on various mechanisms that can influence the spectral variation of the coherent backscattering enhancement factor .",
    "preparation of the ultracold atomic @xmath0rb sample used in the measurements described in this paper has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite , but for completeness will be briefly reviewed here .",
    "the samples are formed in a vapor - loaded magneto - optical trap ( mot ) which is operated in a standard six - beam configuration .",
    "the trapping laser is detuned a frequency of -2.7@xmath8 from resonance , where @xmath9 @xmath2 , is the natural linewidth of the @xmath10 hyperfine transition in @xmath0rb .",
    "laser light for the mot is derived from an injection locked diode laser ( sanyo dl7140 - 201 ) which is slaved to a master laser ( hitachi hg7851 g ) .",
    "the master laser is locked to a crossover peak produced in a doppler - free saturated absorption spectrometer .",
    "laser locking is achieved by dithering the master laser current and demodulating the saturation absorption spectrum with a lock - in amplifier . in order to produce the required light for hyperfine repumping ,",
    "the slave laser is microwave modulated to produce a sideband at the wavelength corresponding to the @xmath11 hyperfine transition .",
    "light exiting the slave passes through an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , which is used as an optical switch , and subsequently coupled into a single mode fiber optic patchcord . the combination of the aom switching and fiber coupling results in an @xmath565 db attenuation of the trapping laser light .",
    "after exiting the fiber , the trapping light is split into three beams and sent to the mot .",
    "each beam contains @xmath53.3 mw of light and is retroreflected , generating an average @xmath519 mw in the center of the chamber .    in order to ascertain the number and density of confined atoms ,",
    "we employ absorption and fluorescence imaging .",
    "we find that the mot is not completely spherical @xcite , but rather is somewhat ` cigar - shaped ' having @xmath12 gaussian radii of 1.1 mm and 1.38 mm , where the radius is defined according to the density distribution @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the peak density .",
    "this distribution results in an optical depth through the center of the mot of about 6 , where the optical depth @xmath15 is defined as resulting in an attenuation of the incident intensity by a factor @xmath16 .",
    "we determine the peak optical depth by direct measurement of the transmitted cbs light intensity through the central region of the mot . in these measurements , probing of the density takes place when the mot lasers are off , for they result in a significant excited state fraction , decreasing the measured optical depth . for a gaussian atom distribution in the mot ,",
    "the optical depth is given by @xmath17 @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the cross - section for light scattering  @xcite .",
    "with the values given above and an average gaussian radius @xmath20 @xmath21 , we calculate that the mot contains approximately @xmath22 atoms and has a peak density @xmath23 @xmath24 atoms-@xmath25 .",
    "note that these parameters are large enough to insure an optical depth large enough for coherent multiple scattering , but that the density is not so large as to necessitate consideration of cooperative pair scattering in the vapor .",
    "schematic diagram of the coherent backscattering apparatus . shown in the figure is an acousto optic modulator ( aom ) , magneto optic trap ( mot ) , linear polarizer ( lp ) , quarter wave plate ( qwp ) , and a charge coupled device ( ccd ) camera.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    the vapor - loaded mot is formed in a custom - made stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) chamber that is pumped by both an ion and titanium sublimation pump .",
    "the uhv chamber is fitted with a stainless - steel sidearm containing a valvable and heated rb reservoir .  because we are observing light which is backscattered from our sample ,",
    "it is critical that all other backscattered reflections are suppressed .",
    "a major source of unwanted back - scattered light is from the vacuum viewports on the mot chamber . in order to minimize this light ,",
    "we installed wedged optical quality windows having a `` v''-type antireflection ( ar)coating at 780 nm on the probe - laser ( described in the following section ) entrance and exit ports .",
    "the ar coating results in less than 0.25% reflectivity at 780 nm .",
    "further , the window through which the probe laser beam enters is mounted on a uhv bellows , allowing us to better direct unwanted reflections from entering the charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detector .",
    "we also found it necessary to replace the standard window on the ccd camera with a wedged and near - infrared ar coated window in order to suppress interference fringe formation in the ccd images .",
    "we present in this section a brief overview of the coherent backscattering apparatus used to obtain the experimental results reported here .",
    "further details may be found in kulatunga , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the experimental apparatus used in experiments to study coherent radiative transfer in an ultracold gas of @xmath0rb @xcite is described . a schematic diagram of the arrangement is shown in figure 1 .",
    "there the external light source used in the experiment is provided by an external cavity diode laser that is stabilized by saturated absorption to a crossover resonance associated with hyperfine components of the 5s @xmath26s@xmath27 @xmath28 5p @xmath26p@xmath29 transition . with reference to figure 2 , which shows relevant hyperfine transitions in @xmath0rb",
    ", the laser may be tuned several hundred mhz from nearly any hyperfine resonance in @xmath0rb by a standard offset locking technique using an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "detuning from resonance is defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the cbs laser frequency and @xmath32 is the @xmath33 resonance frequency .",
    "the laser bandwidth is a few hundred khz , and the typical output power is @xmath55 mw . the laser output is launched into a single mode polarization preserving fiber and then beam expanded and collimated by a beam expander to a @xmath12 diameter of about 8 mm . the polarization of the resulting beam is selected and then the beam passed through a nonpolarizing and wedged 50 - 50 beam splitter that passes approximately half of the laser power to the atomic sample .",
    "the backscattered radiation is directed by the same beam splitter to a field lens of 45 cm focal length , which condenses the light on the focal plane of a liquid nitrogen cooled ccd camera .",
    "the diffraction limited spatial resolution is about 100 @xmath34 , while the polarization analyzing power is greater than 2000 at 780 nm .",
    "there are four polarization channels that are customarily studied in coherent backscattering . for linearly polarized input radiation ,",
    "two of these correspond to measuring the backscattered light in two mutually orthogonal output channels .",
    "this is readily achieved by removing the quarter wave plate , as shown in figure 1 , and rotating the linear polarization analyzer located before the field lens . for input radiation of definite helicity , that being generated by the linearly polarized input and the quarter wave plate ,",
    "the other two channels correspond to the helicity of the backscattered radiation .",
    "this is similarly measured by rotation of the linear polarizer just before the field lens .",
    "the instrumentation as described , with some modifications to suppress the intense trapping beam fluorescence , has been previously used to study coherent backscattering in ultracold atomic gases and in solid and liquid samples as well @xcite .",
    "hyperfine energy levels of relevant transitions in atomic @xmath0rb.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    measurements of the backscattered light is made by exposing the ultracold atoms to the cbs laser light for an interval of 0.25 ms temporally centered in a 5 ms dark interval during which the mot lasers are turned off .",
    "the mot lasers are then turned back on for 20 ms , which is sufficiently long that the cold atom sample is reconstituted .",
    "this procedure is repeated for 300 s , which constitutes a single experimental run .",
    "a run of 300 s with the mot absent allows measurement of the background , which is principally due to hot atom fluorescence excited by the cbs laser .",
    "attenuation of the cbs laser by the mot during the data taking phase , which reduces the amount of background during the backscattering run , in comparison with the background phase , is accounted for by auxiliary measurements of the mot attenuation of the cbs laser intensity .",
    "finally , the saturation parameter for the cbs laser is less than s = 0.08 on resonance , which with the 0.25 ms measurement interval is sufficient to minimize mechanical action of the cbs laser beam on the atomic sample .",
    "a general theory of the coherent backscattering process in an ultracold atomic gas has been developed recently by several groups cbsth1,kcbsth1,kcbsth2 .",
    "the theoretical development essentially maintains the earlier conceptions of weak localization in the atomic scattering problem @xcite , and takes into account the influence of the optical depth and sample size on the character of the coherent backscattering cone . in spite of the fact that the basic ladder and interference terms , describing the process , have a similar structure in all the theoretical approaches , there are certain types of accompanying physical phenomena which can become more important as more detailed experimental or theoretical spectral analysis is considered .    in our earlier theoretical approach @xcite ,",
    "the general analytical development was realized by a monte - carlo simulation of coherent multiple scattering in an ultracold ( @xmath35 @xmath36 ) gas of @xmath0rb atoms confined in a magneto optical trap .",
    "the simulation was closely matched to the experimental density distribution and temperature conditions as described in the previous paragraphs .",
    "the radiation field frequency was selected to be in the vicinity of the @xmath10 hyperfine transition , and to have polarization states and a weak - field intensity corresponding to the experimental realization .",
    "the effects of sample size , and the spatial and polarization dependence of the coherent backscattering cone were considered in detail .",
    "some aspects of the spectral variation of the coherent backscattering enhancement factor were also considered , including the surprisingly - strong influence of the far - off - resonance @xmath37 and @xmath38 hyperfine transitions .",
    "however , other physical effects can have a profound influence on the spectral variations , and we consider some of those in the present report . among these , for currently achievable laboratory conditions , are ( i ) heating of the atomic gas by multiple scattering of the probing light source , ( ii ) optical pumping effects initiated by the probe or mot lasers , and ( iii ) the influence of the finite bandwidth of the probe laser .",
    "each of these effects has been quantitatively ignored in earlier studies , since their role is not so crucial to calculations of the basic characteristics of the cbs process .",
    "of particular interest is the influence of atomic motion and internal polarization variables on the spectral variations of the cbs enhancement .",
    "we point out that to properly account for these factors , it is necessary to consider the influence of the mean field on both attenuation and dispersion of the multiply scattered light , and to include also the anisotropic green s function for light propagating along a chain of scatterers .",
    "as is seen in the following section , inclusion of some such effects , in isolation or combination , may well be essential to better agreement between experimental and theoretical results .",
    "finally we emphasize that the simulations are made for conditions quite close to those in the experiment .",
    "these conditions include sample size , temperature , shape and density , and the characteristic intensity of the cbs laser beam .",
    "these conditions are such that cooperative scattering may be neglected , and such that saturation of the atomic transition is also negligible . in simulations of thermal effects , and of the influence of atomic magnetization on the coherent backscattering enhancement ,",
    "more severe conditions are used in order to illustrate possible range of influence of the effects .",
    "in this section we present experimental and theoretical results associated with backscattering of near - resonance radiation from ultracold atomic @xmath0rb .",
    "first we present experimental measurements of the spectral variation of the coherent backscattering enhancement , in a range of approximately @xmath39 , as a function of detuning from the @xmath10 hyperfine transition .",
    "these results are directly compared to theoretical simulations , made with inclusion of the influence of off - resonant hyperfine transitions and considering an ultracold sample not at absolute zero .",
    "second , we present simulations of several effects which should generally be considered when modelling coherent backscattering from ultracold atomic vapors .",

    "the measurements have a typical uncertainty on the order of 2% , this being due to a combination of statistical uncertainty due to counting statistics in the spatial intensity measurements , but also an estimated uncertainty due to the cone fitting procedure , as described previously kulatunga1 .",
    "in addition , there is residual noise in the spatial distribution of backscattered light due to speckle in the @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath50 and @xmath52 channels ; slight variations in speckle appearing in background scattered light from run to run does not completely average to zero .",
    "this effect is responsible for the somewhat larger fluctuations in the extracted enhancement factors for these two polarization channels .",
    "there is a small systematic reduction of the peak enhancement due to the finite spatial resolution of the backscattering polarimeter , an effect which arises from smoothing of the nearly cusped shaped cbs cone near its peak by the finite spatial resolution of the instrument .",
    "this is accounted for by using a lorentzian model of the spatial response and the cbs cone , which allows an estimate of the amount of reduction .",
    "justification for this is made by the fact that the spatial variation of the simulated cones is to a good approximation described by a lorentzian , as is the measured spatial response of the experimental apparatus .  in our case , accounting for this effect amounts to a maximum decrease in the peak enhancement @xmath53 in the enhancement for the narrowest cones , which appear in the @xmath54 @xmath51 @xmath54 data .",
    "this estimated correction is not made to the data in figs .",
    "3 - 6 . on the scale of the figures ,",
    "there is negligible uncertainty in the detuning measurements .",
    "+    also shown in the figures are simulations of the enhancement for several different values of the average doppler shift of the atoms , measured in units of the natural spectral width @xmath8 .",
    "it appears , from comparison of the experimental data and the simulations that the data is better described by inclusion of some nonzero average heating of the vapor  on the order of a few hundred khz .",
    "note that in a following section we model the influence of the finite bandwidth of the cbs laser ; it is seen there that the decrease in enhancement on resonance , as seen in figures 3 - 6 , can not be explained by that mechanism .",
    "the initial temperature of the atomic ensemble is @xmath5 @xmath55 , which makes negligible any possible spectral manifestations caused by atomic motion .",
    "however , during the interaction time , the probe light produces a certain mechanical action on the atoms .",
    "the radiation force associated with the probe light can accelerate the atoms and heat them to temperatures where the doppler broadening and shift can become comparable with the natural linewidth .",
    "it is important to recognize that the initial scattering event transfers momentum from the cbs laser to the atomic ensemble , but that subsequent scattering of the light deep within the sample is more nearly isotropic , resulting in some effective heating of the atoms during the cbs data taking phase .",
    "although the dynamical process is complex , and is currently under study , we present here a short discussion of this process by comparing several scanning spectra averaged over an equilibrium maxwell distribution of atom velocities , that is for different temperatures and respectively for different doppler widths .",
    "the drift velocity of the atomic cloud , which also exists but was ignored in our calculations , leads ( to a good approximation ) to a doppler shift of all the spectral dependencies into the blue wing with respect to the laser frequency @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to the experimental data , there are also shown in figures 3 - 6 calculated spectral variations of the enhancement factor for all four polarization channels . in the graphs ,",
    "the velocity is indicated as a fraction of the natural width of the atomic transition , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the the most probable velocity in the atomic ensemble ) .",
    "it is seen from these graphs that the shape of the spectra becomes significantly modified , even for an average doppler breadth of @xmath58 , where @xmath8 is the natural atomic width .",
    "similar results are also obtained in the linear polarization channels .",
    "the overall trend suggests that dynamical heating , or some other mechanism which modifies the spectrum in a similar way , will be required to describe the experimental results .",
    "of particular interest is the helicity preserving channel ( figure 5 ) .",
    "unique to this case is an increase in the enhancement , even for no atomic motion , for moderate detunings away from exact resonance .",
    "as described in a previous report @xcite , this is due to the suppressed role of raman - type single scattering .",
    "the asymmetry is due to the nonnegligible influence of far off resonance hyperfine transitions on the coherent backscattering enhancement .",
    "this effect is suggested in the overall spectral trend of the data , although more precise measurements are clearly in order .  in the following section",
    ", we see that a much larger enhancement increase at greater detunings can also arise from dynamical ( or static ) magnetization of the vapor along the direction of propagation of the cbs laser beam .    scanning spectra of cbs enhancement for ( a ) _ h _ @xmath51 _ h _ and ( b ) _ h _ @xmath46 _ h _ polarization channels .",
    "spectra are shown for an average doppler broadening varying from @xmath41 to @xmath59 , in the ensemble of @xmath60rb atoms with @xmath61 and @xmath48.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we finish this section by presenting for completeness theoretical results over a wider spectral range for the detuning dependence of the cbs enhancement .",
    "these are shown in figure 7 ( a ) for the helicity preserving channel and in figure 7 ( b ) for the helicity nonpreserving channel .",
    "the results show that there is some persistence of the cbs enhancement , even for an average doppler broadening on the order of the natural line width of the atomic transition , and that this enhancement increases at larger detunings , before falling off at the largest offsets , when single scattering becomes dominant .",
    "effects on coherent radiative transport in an atomic vapor will generally depend on the polarization of the incident light and on the nonzero ground state multipoles in the atomic vapor .  in our experimental arrangement ,",
    "the atoms are confined to a magneto optic trap , in which there exist generally spatially varying hyperfine multipoles .  however , the mot lasers are typically turned off for several ms before taking data in a coherent backscattering experiment , and residual macroscopic atomic polarization should be largely dissipated on that time scale .  however , there can be hyperfine multipoles generated by the cbs laser itself , dynamically polarizing the vapor .",
    "the main argument , why there is no optical pumping manifestation in the cbs process , comes from the reasonable assumption that under not atypical experimental conditions the probe radiation is weak and characterized by a small saturation parameter .",
    "however , it is quite clear that in an ensemble of cold atoms the relaxation mechanisms in the ground state , which mainly are collisional , play a reduced role and become even negligible .",
    "then , after each cycle of interaction with the polarized cbs light , the atomic ensemble can accumulate a certain degree of polarization , which may be either of an orientation or alignment type . of particular interest to us here",
    "is when the incident radiation has definite helicity , which can magnetize the vapor along the cbs propagation direction .",
    "it is quite difficult to estimate precisely the actual dynamical spatial distribution , within the atomic cloud , of polarization generated during the whole interaction cycle .",
    "therefore in this section we only qualitatively illustrate how the optical pumping effects can change a basic characteristic of the cbs process such as the enhancement factor .",
    "diagram explaining the cbs phenomenon for double scattering in an ensemble of oriented atoms of @xmath43rb atoms .",
    "there is only one transition amplitude in the helicity preserving channel , which leads to maximal enhancement of backward scattered light .",
    "the direct and reciprocal transitions and photon paths are shown by solid and dashed arrows respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +    consider probing the atomic sample with positive helicity circular polarized radiation .",
    "let us consider further that , due to optical pumping , the atoms become oriented only along the propagation direction of the light beam . in steady state , following a sufficiently long pumping time , if there is no relaxation in the ground state , the atoms should be concentrated in the zeeman sublevel @xmath62 , see figures 2 and 8 .",
    "of course , this is an idealized case which can never be precisely attained in reality , but such a model situation is convenient for illustrative purposes .",
    "the spectral variations of the enhancement factor for such an oriented ensemble are shown in figure 9 for the case of monochromatic probe radiation and for a gaussian - type cloud with the peak density @xmath61 and with a radius @xmath63 .",
    "the spectral variation of the enhancement in the helicity preserving channel shows quite unusual behavior , in that there is no reduction of the cbs enhancement in the spectral wings . on the contrary",
    ", the enhancement factor approaches its maximal possible value of two .",
    "the limiting factor of two is normally associated with rayleigh - type scattering on classical objects .",
    "but here we deal with rayleigh - type scattering under approximately attainable , but not typical quantum conditions .",
    "this result may be explained by a simple but fundamental property that in such a coherent atomic ensemble there is no single - atom scattering of raman - typeradiation in the backward direction , which potentially could also be a source of backscattered light in the helicity - preserving channel .",
    "moreover , the partial contribution of only double scattering on oriented atoms in an optically thin sample causes the enhancement factor to take the maximum possible numerical value of two .",
    "this can be understood by turning to figure 8 , where it is shown that there is only one channel , or one product of the transition matrix elements , contributing in the scattering amplitude of the double rayleigh scattering , that is in the helicity preserving channel .",
    "these are ideal conditions to observe maximal enhancement in the cbs process . in higher orders",
    "there are several partial contributions and not all of them can interfere .",
    "this , as usual , leads to essential reduction of the interference contribution to the total intensity of scattered light .",
    "due to such reduction",
    "the enhancement factor considerably decreases in the spectral domain near the resonance scattering , as shown in figure 9 .",
    "thus in the wings of the helicity preserving curve in the graph of figure 9 a unique situation is revealed when _ in an optically thin medium under special conditions the enhancement factor can increase to its maximal value_.    scanning spectra of enhancement for circular polarized probe light in an ensemble of atoms of @xmath43rb atoms with 100% orientation in the direction the light propagation .",
    "the spectra were calculated for a gaussian type atomic cloud with @xmath61 and @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +    the output spectral response of the cbs light when the input circular polarized laser radiation , modeled by a lorentzian spectrum ( [ t1 ] ) with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , is tuned in the blue wing of the @xmath66 optical transition of @xmath60rb . the first graph ( a )",
    "shows the distortion of the input lorentzian profile ( dotted curve ) for the total ladder and interference contribution ; it is normalized to the total output intensity of the cbs light .",
    "the second graph ( b ) shows the distortion for the interference term only ; it is normalized according to the corresponding enhancement factor .",
    "both the dependencies relate to the same helicity preserving channel.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +    the multiple scattering in the helicity non - preserving channel shows more ordinary behavior .",
    "the disappearance of cbs in the wings is caused by the dominating contribution of single scattering events as far as the sample becomes optically thin .",
    "we point out that there is , for this polarization channel also , a certain increase of the maximal value of enhancement in comparing with a non - oriented atomic ensemble . here , as in the linear polarization channels , we see that optical pumping phenomenon leads to some quantitative but not qualitative changes in observation of the cbs process . however , the combined results of the numerical simulations presented in this and the previous section suggest that the experimental results may be essentially modified by the combined influence of thermal and optical pumping effects .      in an experiment ,",
    "the cbs probe laser operates ideally in a single - mode regime and its spectral bandwidth is much less than the natural relaxation rate of the atoms .",
    "but in reality the difference is not necessarily so great to completely ignore the spectral distribution of the laser radiation .",
    "typically in our experiments on spectral scanning the sample consisting of rubidium atoms , which have a resonance line natural decay rate @xmath67 , the laser radiation has normally a bandwidth of less than @xmath68 . for the multiple scattering process in higher orders , the scanned spectral profile of the sample is formed as a successive overlap of individual profiles per scattering event , the effective output shape reveals a much narrower spectral variance than @xmath8 .",
    "thus the bandwidth of the laser mode can become comparable with the spectral inhomogeneity in the sample spectrum associated with partial contributions of the higher scattering orders .",
    "this can be quantitatively discussed with the following model of a quasi - monochromatic single mode laser radiation . to define the basic parameters we approximated the assumed homogeneously broadened spectrum of the cbs laser by a lorentzian profile @xmath69where @xmath31 and @xmath70 are the carrier frequency and the spectral bandwidth of the laser radiation respectively .",
    "@xmath71 is the total intensity of the incident laser radiation .",
    "the spectrum obeys to the following normalization condition @xmath72where in the quasi - monochromatic approximation there is no difference between @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the lower limit of this integral .",
    "the basic idea in this case is that , in comparison with purely monochromatic radiation , the spectral response of the initially symmetric but broadened input spectral profile ( [ t1 ] ) should be significantly distorted by the sample due to effects of multiple scattering .    in figure 10",

    "( [ t1 ] ) with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , is tuned in the blue wing of the @xmath10 optical transition of @xmath60rb with resonant frequency @xmath32 .",
    "the first graph plotted in figure 10 ( a ) shows the distortion of the input lorentzian profile for the total ladder and interference contribution , the intensity being normalized to the total output intensity of the cbs light . in turn , the second graph depicted in figure 10 ( b ) shows the distortion of the interference term only .",
    "this term is normalized according to the corresponding enhancement factor @xmath77 [ to @xmath78 .",
    "both the dependencies relate to the same helicity preserving channel .",
    "it is clearly seen that the output spectral profile becomes asymmetric because of the influence of resonance scattering near the atomic transition in higher orders of multiple scattering .",
    "it  may be less obvious , but there is also a small but not negligible difference between the two spectral dependences , which explains why in our experiment the spectral probe of the sample with scanning carrier frequency @xmath31 near the resonance can be sensitive to the spectral bandwidth of the cbs laser .",

    "it is shown that the spectra of the total intensity and of the enhancement factor , generated by scanning of the frequency @xmath31 , reveals different spectral behavior , particularly in the wings of scanned profiles .",
    "these are calculated results for the helicity polarization channels , but similar behavior takes place for the linear polarization channel . at first sight",
    "this spectral divergence appears as a rather weak effect , but we believe it should not be ignored in precise comparison of the experimental data with numerical simulations . particularly , it can be important in a realistic estimation of the background , since such a spectral washing in the probe radiation response can be important in the interpolation procedure of the cbs cone to its wing . indeed , the higher orders of multiple scattering contribute to the formation of the central portion of the cbs cone , but the role of second order scattering is more important in its wings .",
    "as we see for large spectral detunings , the correct estimation of the enhancement factor in higher orders of multiple scattering is rather sensitive to the spectral distribution of the probe radiation .",
    "a combined theoretical and experimental study of spectral variations in the coherent backscattering enhancement factor , for a very narrow band resonance system , has been reported .",
    "experimental data taken over a range of two atomic natural widths about direct atomic resonance suggests spectral variations in the peak value of the cbs enhancement .",
    "simulations indicate that the combined influence of heating of the atomic ensemble , and optical pumping of the zeeman sublevels in the @xmath81 ground level during the coherent backscattering data taking phase , can qualitatively account for the effects .",
    "the simulations of the cbs process examined the influence of atomic motion , in a thermal equilibrium model , on the spectral variation of the enhancement factor .",
    "a model case of magnetization of the vapor due to optical pumping was also considered .",
    "it was found that these two factors could explain variations in the cbs enhancement observed in the experiments .",
    "the simulations which considered the influence of atomic magnetization predicted a remarkable result ; the classical cbs maximum enhancement of two could be closely approached for a strongly magnetized atomic sample .",
    "finally , it was shown , by simulation of the influence of the spectral bandwidth of the cbs probe laser , that even a quite small laser line width , in comparison to the natural width of the atomic transition , can influence significantly the cbs enhancement in the wings of the atomic resonance line .",
