    "applications of random matrices in physics ( and mathematics ) are known to range from energy levels statistics in nuclei to number theory and from quantum chaos to string theory .",

    "the progenitor of ensembles of matrices with general complex eigenvalues is the statistical model of complex matrices with the gaussian weight introduced by ginibre @xcite in 1965 .",

    "along with the ginibre ensemble and its generalizations we also consider ensembles of normal matrices @xcite , i.e. , such that @xmath6 commutes with its hermitian conjugate @xmath7 .",
    "since one is primarily interested in statistics of eigenvalues , it is natural to express the probability density in terms of complex eigenvalues @xmath8 of the matrix @xmath6 .",
    "it appears that the volume element can be represented as [ intro2 ] [ d ] _",
    "i < j |z_i - z_j |^2 _ i d^2 z_i .",
    "if the statistical weight depends on the eigenvalues only , as it is usually assumed , the other parameters of the matrix ( often referred to as  angular variables \" ) are irrelevant and can be integrated out giving an overall normalization factor . in this case",
    "the original matrix problem reduces to statistical mechanics of @xmath1 particles with complex coordinates @xmath9 in the plane .",
    "specifically , the factor @xmath10 , being equal to the exponentiated coulomb energy in two dimensions , means an effective  repelling \" of eigenvalues .",
    "this remark leads to the dyson logarithmic gas interpretation @xcite , which treats the matrix ensemble as a two - dimensional  plasma \" of eigenvalues in a background field and prompts to introduce more general  @xmath0-ensembles \" with the statistical weight proportional to @xmath11 .",

    "an important observation made in @xcite and developed in subsequent works @xcite is that evolution of an averaged spectrum of such matrices as a function of @xmath5 , as @xmath14 , serves as a simulation of laplacian growth of water droplets in the hele - shaw cell ( for different physical and mathematical aspects of the latter see @xcite ) . to be more precise , in the limit @xmath15",
    ", under some weak assumptions about the statistical weight , the eigenvalues are confined , with probability 1 , to a compact domain in the complex plane .",
    "one can ask how its shape depends on the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the answer is : this dependence is exactly the laplacian growth of the domain with zero surface tension .",
    "namely , the edge of the support moves along gradient of a scalar harmonic field in its exterior , with the velocity being proportional to the absolute value of the gradient .",
    "the general solution can be expressed in term of the exterior dirichlet boundary value problem .",
    "this fact allows one to treat the model of normal or complex random matrices as a growth problem @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this viewpoint is two - fold .",
    "first , the hydrodynamic interpretation makes some of the large @xmath1 matrix model results more illuminating and intuitively accessible .",
    "second and most important , the matrix model perspective may help to suggest new approaches to the long - standing growth problems . in this respect , of special interest",

    "this interpretation , first suggested by dyson @xcite for the unitary , symplectic and orthogonal matrix ensembles , relies on rewriting @xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
    "clearly , the integral ( [ z ] ) looks then exactly as the partition function of the 2d coulomb plasma ( often called the dyson gas ) in the external field : [ ze ] z_n = e^-e(z_1 ,  , z_n ) d^2 z_j , where [ energy ] e=-_i < j|z_i -z_j |^2 -_j w(z_j )",

    "so , the dyson gas picture for ensembles of matrices with general complex eigenvalues distributed on the plane looks even more natural .",
    "it becomes especially helpful in the large @xmath1 limit , where it allows one to apply thermodynamical arguments .",

    "here we present some general exact relations for correlation functions valid for any values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",

    "typical correlation functions which we are going to study are mean values of products of traces : @xmath103 , @xmath104 and so on .",
    "clearly , they are represented as integrals over eigenvalues .",
    "for instance , @xmath105 a particularly important example is the density function defined as [ density1 ] ( z)=_j ^(2 ) ( z - z_j ) , where @xmath106 is the 2d @xmath107-function .",
    "note that in our units @xmath19 has dimension of @xmath108 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath109 is dimensionless .",

    "j=1^nd^2 z_j . instead of correlations of density",
    "it is often convenient to consider correlations of the field [ potential1 ] ( z)=-_j    of the relation [ rhophi ] 4(z)=-(z ) , where @xmath111 is the laplace operator .",
    "clearly , @xmath112 is the 2d coulomb potential created by the eigenvalues ( charges ) .    handling with multi - point correlation functions , it is customary to pass to their _ connected parts_. for example , in the case of 2-point functions , the connected correlation function is defined as @xmath113 the connected multi - trace correlators are expressed through the connected density correlators by the same formula ( [ trf ] ) with @xmath114 in the r.h.s",
    ". the connected part of the @xmath115-point density correlation function is given by the linear response of the @xmath116-point one to a small variation of the potential .",
    "more precisely , the following variational formulas hold true : [ var ] ( z ) = ^2 , ( z_1 ) ( z_2)_c=^2 = ^4 .",
    "connected multi - point correlators are higher variational derivatives of @xmath117 .",
    "these formulas follow from the fact that variation of the partition function over a general potential @xmath13 inserts @xmath118 into the integral . basically , they are linear response relations used in the coulomb gas theory @xcite .",

    "this quantity plays an important role .",
    "it is to be compared with the stress energy tensor in 2d cft .",

    "the simplest one is obtained at @xmath129 : @xmath130 .",
    "it reads : [ loopeq ] d^2 + ( ( z))^2 + ( 2 - ) ^2 ( z)=0 . this identity gives an exact relation between one- and two - point correlation functions because the mean value @xmath131 can be reproduced from the two - point correlation function @xmath132 by averaging over all possible directions of approaching @xmath133 : [ limint ] ( ( z))^2 = _ 0 _ 0 ^ 2 ( z ) ( z + e^i)d .",
    "another interesting choice is @xmath134 , where @xmath135 , then @xmath136 and ( [ g3 ] ) yields [ g5 ] l(z ) ( ) + = 0 .",

    "starting from this section , we study the large @xmath1 limit [ large ] n , 0 , n = t .",
    "we shall see that in this limit meaningful analytic and algebro - geometric structures emerge , as well as important applications in physics .",
    "it is instructive to think about the large @xmath1 limit under consideration in terms of the dyson gas picture .",
    "then the limit we are interested in corresponds to a very low temperature of the gas , when fluctuations around equilibrium positions of the charges are negligible .",
    "the main contribution to the partition function then comes from a configuration , where the charges are  frozen \" at their equilibrium positions .",
    "it is also important that the temperature tends to zero simultaneously with increasing the number of charges , so the plasma can be regarded as a continuous fluid at static equilibrium .",
    "mathematically , all this means that the integral is evaluated by the saddle point method , with only the leading contribution being taken into account . as @xmath143 , correlation functions take their  classical \" values @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and multi - point functions factorize in the leading order : @xmath146 , etc . then the loop equation ( [ loopeq ] ) becomes a closed relation for @xmath147 : [ loopeq2 ] d^2 + ( ( z))^2 = 0 , where we have ignored the last term because it has a higher order in @xmath19 . applying @xmath148 to the both terms , we get : @xmath149 . since @xmath150 ( see ( [ rhophi ] ) ) , we obtain [ large1 ] ( z ) = 0 .",
