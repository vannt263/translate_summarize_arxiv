    "kac @xcite in 1956 to obtain a solution from a poisson of the telegraph equation @xmath3 with @xmath4 , introduced the processes @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a poisson process of intensity @xmath7 .",
    "he noticed that if in equation ( [ tele ] ) the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 tend to infinity with @xmath9 constant and equal to @xmath10 , then the equation converges to the heat equation : @xmath11 let @xmath12 be the processes considered by kac with @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "these values satisfy that @xmath9 is constant and @xmath15 and we get in ( [ calor ] ) an equation whose solution is a standard brownian motion .",
    "stroock @xcite proved in 1982 that the processes @xmath16 converge in law to a standard brownian motion .",
    "that is , if we consider @xmath17 the image law of the process @xmath16 in the banach space @xmath18)$ ] of continuous functions on @xmath19 $ ] , then @xmath17 converges weakly , when @xmath20 tends to zero , towards the wiener measure .",
    "doing a change of variables , these processes can be written as @xmath21\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a standard poisson process .    in the mathematical literature",
    "we find generalizations with regard to the stroock result which can be channeled in three directions :    a.   modifying the processes @xmath16 in order to obtain approximations of other gaussian processes , b.   proving convergence in a stronger sense that the convergence in law in the space of continuous functions , c.   weakening the conditions of the approximating processes .    in direction",
    "( i ) , a first generalization is also made by stroock @xcite who modified the processes @xmath16 to obtain approximations of stochastic differential equations .",
    "there are also generalizations , among others , to the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite , to a general class of gaussian processes ( that includes fbm ) @xcite , to a fractional stochastic differential equation @xcite , to the stochastic heat equation driven by gaussian white noise @xcite or to the stratonovich heat equation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is some literature where the authors present realizations of the processes that converge almost surely , uniformly on the unit time interval .",
    "these processes are usually called as uniform transport processes . since the approximations always start increasing , a modification of the processes as @xmath23 has to be considered where @xmath24 independent of the poisson process @xmath25 .",
    "griego , heath and ruiz - moncayo @xcite showed that these processes converge strongly and uniformly on bounded time intervals to brownian motion . in @xcite gorostiza and griego extended the result to diffusions .",
    "again gorostiza and griego @xcite and csrg and horvth @xcite obtained a rate of convergence .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite it is proved that there exist versions of the transport processes @xmath26 on the same probability space as a given brownian motion @xmath27 such that , for each @xmath28 , @xmath29 as @xmath30 and where @xmath31 is a positive constant depending on @xmath7 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "garzn , gorostiza and len @xcite defined a sequence of processes that converges strongly to fractional brownian motion uniformly on bounded intervals , for any hurst parameter @xmath34 and computed the rate of convergence . in @xcite and @xcite the same authors deal with subfractional brownian motion and fractional stochastic differential equations .    since @xmath35 the question that if the convergence is also true with other angles appears .",
    "bardina @xcite showed that if we consider @xmath36 where @xmath37 the laws of the processes converge weakly towards the law of a complex brownian motion , i.e. , the laws of the real and imaginary parts @xmath38 and @xmath39 converge weakly towards the law of two independent brownian motions .",
    "the approximating processes are functionally dependent because we use a single poisson process but , in the limit , we obtain two independent processes . later , in @xcite it is shown that for different angles @xmath40 the corresponding processes converge in law towards independent brownian motions despite using only one poisson process . finally , in @xcite , we prove that we can use a lvy process instead of a poisson process in the definition of the sequence of approximations .",
    "in this paper we present an extension of the kac - stroock result in the directions ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "our aim is to define a modification of the processes @xmath41 used by stroock , similar to ( [ dedede ] ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "these complex processes , that we will denote by @xmath42 , will depend on a parameter @xmath43 and will be defined from an unique standard poisson process and a sequence of independent random variables with common distribution bernoulli(@xmath44 ) .",
    "we will check that if we consider @xmath45 such that for all @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the law of the processes @xmath51 converges weakly in the space of the continuous functions towards the joint law of @xmath52 independent brownian motions .",
    "moreover , we also prove that there exist realizations of @xmath53 that converge almost surely to a complex brownian motion and we are able to obtain the rate of convergence that does not depend on @xmath54 . as a consequence , simulating a sequence of independent random variables with common distribution exponential(1 ) and a sequence of independent random variables with common distribution bernoulli(@xmath44 ) , we can get sequences of almost sure approximations of @xmath55 independent brownian motions for any @xmath55 .    for simplicity s sake , we only consider @xmath56 for which it does not exist any @xmath57 such that @xmath58 or @xmath59 .    as usual , the weak convergence is proved using tightness and the identification of the law of all possible weak limits ( see , for instance @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we prove that @xmath25 and @xmath65 are poisson processes of parameter 1 with independent increments on disjoint intervals .",
