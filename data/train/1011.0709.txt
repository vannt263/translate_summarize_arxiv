    "[ sec.1 ] the possibility of an eta ( @xmath3 ) meson being bound in a nucleus by strong - interaction force , leading to the formation of an exotic nucleus called eta - mesic nucleus , was first proposed in 1986 @xcite .",
    "the nuclear binding of an @xmath3 meson is caused by an attractive eta - nucleon ( @xmath3n ) interaction in the threshold region .",
    "this attractive @xmath3n interaction is due to the n@xmath8(1535 ) resonance being situated not too far above the threshold of the @xmath3n channel ( 1488  mev ) .",
    "it was also shown in ref.@xcite that a bound state is possible if there is a sufficient number of nucleons ( 10 or more ) in a nucleus .",
    "the existence of @xmath3-mesic nuclei will certainly create new premises for studying @xmath3 meson and baryon resonances inside nuclei .",
    "extensive interest in exploring this new venue is evidenced by the large amount of theoretical work that has been done during the last two decades  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "irrespective of the models and formalisms used , from a theoretical point of view there is unanimity about the existence of @xmath3-mesic nucleus .",
    "recently , the cosy - gem collaboration  @xcite searched for @xmath3-mesic nucleus by means of a recoil - free transfer reaction @xmath9 .",
    "the kinematics was so chosen that the @xmath3 produced in the intermediate state is nearly at rest , favoring its capture by the residual nucleus @xmath4 mg . because of energy conservation , the bound @xmath3 can not reappear as an observable particle in the decay products of the mesic nucleus @xmath4mg@xmath10 . instead , it interacts , for example , with a target neutron resulting in the emission of a nearly  back - to - back \" @xmath11 pair in the laboratory .",
    "we denote this multi - step reaction as process m ( m for mesic - nucleus ) :    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath4mg@xmath5    @xmath13    @xmath14x  .    in order to reduce a large number of background events arising from particles being emitted during nuclear cascade process",
    ", the cosy - gem collaboration implemented a triple - coincidence measurement among @xmath15he and the  back - to - back \" @xmath11 pair having the kinetic energy spectra of the pion and proton peaked , respectively , at about 100 and 320  mev  @xcite .",
    "because of this background reduction , a peak in the missing - mass spectrum in the energy region corresponding to bound @xmath3 has been made evident . upon fitting the spectrum with the sum of a background term and a gaussian ( @xmath16 )",
    ", cosy - gem collaboration determined that the peak has its centroid situated at binding energy @xmath17  mev with a fwhm of @xmath18  mev [ or a half - width @xmath19 mev ] .    by performing a bound - state calculation based on scattering length and using on - shell kinematics , we find that the above binding energy and half - width correspond to an effective @xmath20-wave @xmath3n scattering length @xmath21  fm",
    ". an exceptional feature of this scattering length is its imaginary - to - real part ratio @xmath22 = 0.26 only , while most of the published theoretical models give scattering lengths ( see table  [ tabi ] of ref.@xcite ) having @xmath23 . in other words ,",
    "the value of @xmath24 given by the theories is higher than the fitted value by at least 35% .",
    "the need to understand the huge difference between theory and experiment has motivated the present study .",
    "more specifically , we will reanalyze the experiment and infer from our analysis the nature of the observed peak structure and the qualitative feature of the n@xmath6(1535)-nucleus interaction . in section",

    "[ sec.1.1 ] the eigenvalue equation of the bound - state of an @xmath3 meson in a nucleus is @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath3-nucleus potential @xmath26 is complex because the @xmath27 channels are open .",
    "hence , the eigenenergy @xmath28 is also complex and can be written as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the binding energy and width of the bound state , respectively .",

    ", we use the coupled - channel isobar ( cci ) model of bhalerao and liu  @xcite to calculate the potential given by eq.([1.1 ] ) .",

    "second , it was this model that was used to predict the existence of @xmath3-nucleus bound states .",
    "furthermore , as has been noted in the previous section , the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental value of @xmath24 exists for all published models , including the cci model .",

    "[ sec.3 ] our analysis shows that two reaction processes are contributing to the observed spectrum of the bound @xmath3 in @xmath4 mg . the interference between these processes causes the centroid of the observed spectrum to appear at an energy stronger than the actual binding energy of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "the effective @xmath3n scattering lengths that reproduced @xmath54 and @xmath127 used in @xmath123 associated with the dashed and solid curves of fig.[fig3 ] are , respectively , @xmath152  fm and @xmath153  fm . the corresponding imaginary - to - real part ratios are @xmath24=0.42 and 0.49 , consistent with theories ( see section  [ sec.1 ] ) .",
    "we , therefore , explained the apparent discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "the present analysis also indicates that the real part of the interaction between n@xmath8 and @xmath4 mg is attractive at energies below the @xmath3n threshold .",
    "this latter new nuclear information should be of value to nuclear physics studies involving the baryon resonance n@xmath8(1535 ) in medium - mass nucleus , such as @xmath4 mg .",
    "we emphasize that the existence of s and m processes and the interference between them are of a general nature .",
    "consequently , our finding on the effects arising from this aspect of reaction dynamics is model - independent . on the other hand , while the specific value of @xmath107 may be model - dependent , its sign ( or the attractive nature of the interaction ) is model - independent .",
    "this is because the negative sign is required to provide more binding which , when combined with interference effects , can lead to sufficient downward shift of the peak in the binding - energy spectrum .",
    "we invite other researchers having at their disposal the detailed off - shell properties of their models to analyze the cosy - gem data to further pin down the value of @xmath107 .",
