    "the inflationary paradigm is the leading theory of the early universe , of fundamental interest for cosmology and particle physics .",
    "understanding the mechanism and energy scale of inflation remain major goals to attain , despite the continuous and fervent efforts invested in this field .",
    "a measurement of primordial gravitational waves would pin down the energy scale of inflation , though it still belongs to the not - so - near future .",
    "one possible way to discriminate between single- and multi - field inflation models is to test the gaussianity of the primordial density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been so far the main and cleanest inflationary probe .",
    "recent results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite suggested tentative 1@xmath6-level evidence of primordial non - gaussianity of the local type , defined by the equation : ( @xmath7)=(@xmath7)+ .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 quantifies the local quadratic deviation of the bardeen potential @xmath8 from a gaussian potential @xmath9 , and it is currently constrained to the value @xmath10 @xcite .    it has long been suggested @xcite that low - redshift observables can also be used to measure primordial non - gaussianity , despite the fact that the density field at such redshifts is strongly non - gaussian due to the action of gravity . in the local non - gaussianity models ,",
    "there are mainly two effects on low - redshift observables as recently outlined in the comprehensive study of @xcite , and further explored in @xcite .",
    "first , @xmath4 induces a scale - dependence in the bias of dark matter halos , which affects primarily the largest scales , i.e. @xmath11 . thus one can in principle separate the @xmath4 scale dependence from the gravitational one , which occurs on smaller scales .",
    "second , the abundance of massive halos is higher / lower for positive / negative values of @xmath4 @xcite . as a final note",
    ", we emphasize the importance of high- and low - redshift constraints on non - gaussianity as their comparison may provide insight into the scale - dependence of @xmath4 @xcite .    in this paper we shall numerically investigate the sensitivity of weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) peak counts to primordial non - gaussianity of the local type .",
    "the potential of wl surveys to constrain @xmath4 has already been tackled @xcite , though without considering shear peaks .",
    "peak counts are a natural candidate for @xmath4 studies , since the largest of them are caused primarily by massive halos . for wl studies of peak statistics , we mention the works of @xcite and the references therein",
    ". should peak counts prove to be a sensitive @xmath4 probe , then one could easily use large future surveys like euclid @xcite or the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite to obtain low - redshift constraints on primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "the observable that we use is the convergence field , i.e. the matter density projected along the line of sight and scaled by a geometrical factor .",
    "we study simulated wl convergence maps created from ray - tracing through a suite of @xmath12-body simulations , generated with the publicly available code @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a subset of these simulations was used and described in the work of @xcite .",
    "three values of @xmath4 are considered : 0 , -100 , + 100 , while the other cosmological parameters are kept fixed .",
    "the cosmology matches the wmap5 results @xcite .",
    "we have a total of 18 simulations , with 6 realizations per @xmath4 value .",
    "the initial conditions for each of the 6 sets of @xmath4-model realizations are matched to reduce the cosmic variance on the comparison of the peak functions corresponding to each model .",
    "the box size is 1600 @xmath14 , the number of particles is @xmath15 , and the softening length is @xmath16 .",
    "we consider a survey similar to euclid @xcite and to lsst @xcite for the wl simulations with : an rms @xmath17 for the intrinsic image ellipticity , a source number density @xmath18 , and a redshift distribution of source galaxies given by @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 .",
    "the median redshift of this distribution is @xmath21 .    from each @xmath12-body simulation",
    "we generate 16 independent fields of view .",
    "each field has an area of @xmath22 and is tiled by @xmath23 pixels , yielding an angular resolution @xmath24 and a total area of @xmath25 for each @xmath4 model .",
    "the effective convergence @xmath26 in each pixel is calculated by tracing a light ray back through the simulation with a multiple - lens - plane ray - tracing algorithm @xcite .",
    "gaussian shape noise with variance @xmath27 is then added to each pixel , which creates a realistic noise level and correlation in the filtered convergence field @xcite .    for the peak finding we use an aperture filter @xcite , matching",
    "an navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite convolved with a gaussian function .",
    "thus we adopt the convergence model : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a gaussian function of width @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the softening length of the simulations , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 otherwise . here",
    "@xmath35 is the nfw convergence profile truncated at the virial radius , defined in @xcite .",
    "this model agrees very well with the measured convergence profiles of the peaks in the maps .",
    "it is useful both when working with simulations , since it accounts for the lack of resolution below the softening scale , and also when using real data , since shear data is difficult to obtain near the centres of clusters .",
    "the amplitude of the smoothed field at a point @xmath36 is given by : m(@xmath37)=d^2x w(@xmath37-@xmath7 ) ( @xmath7 ) , [ eq : amp ] where @xmath38 is our filter and @xmath26 is the convergence field .",
    "the filter @xmath38 can be written as follows : w(x)=c_w , [ eq : fil1 ] where @xmath39 is a normalization constant and @xmath40 is the aperture radius , i.e. the radius over which the filter is compensated , and @xmath41 .",
    "we choose the normalization constant to be :",
    "[ eq : norm ] if @xmath42 is the location of a peak created by an nfw cluster of mass @xmath43 and redshift @xmath44 , and the convergence field is smoothed with a filter tuned to precisely such a cluster , i.e. @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fil1 ] ) corresponds to the same @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then this filter returns a maximum @xmath46 at @xmath42 . at this location ,",
    "the amplitude of the smoothed map is : m(@xmath37| m_nfw , z)=m_nfw .",
    "[ eq : assign ] the peak is assigned the mass @xmath43 .",
    "if the peak does not correspond to a real halo , and it is the result of line - of - sight projections , then it can still be assigned an ` effective ' mass . in practice , we smooth the convergence field with filters of various masses , which yield different amplitudes ( larger and smaller than the filter mass ) at the location of peaks .",
    "we interpolate these amplitudes to determine the filter mass that would satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : assign ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath40 to be the virial radius of the cluster to which the filter is tuned : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mean density of the universe .",
    "thus a filter at a given redshift can be specified either through the mass @xmath49 or through its size @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt the mass convention of sheth - tormen @xcite , with an overdensity defined as 200 @xmath50 the mean density ( not the critical density ) , and the concentration parameter of @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the @xmath46 of the mass estimator in a simplified scenario where we ignore projection effects , and consider only the intrinsic ellipticity noise . in this case",
    "the variance of the estimator is given by : @xmath51 , and the @xmath46 is obtained by combining this with the above equations .",
    "note that while the mass estimator does not depend on the shape noise due to the normalization constant @xmath52 , the @xmath46 scales with it as aperture filters usually do : @xmath53 .",
    "finally , in the case where no shape noise is included , we use the same filter as in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this filter can also be obtained by formally taking @xmath54 in eqs  ( [ eq : fil1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : norm ] ) above .",
    "the analysis of the convergence maps is carried out in two situations : with and without shape noise .",
    "we adopt a very conservative approach in which we consider known only the redshift distribution of the source galaxies and the shape noise level , without any other information on the sources or on the detected peaks .",
    "we also do not resort to tomographic techniques . while this is an overly - pessimistic scenario for a next - generation lensing survey like euclid or lsst ,",
    "our goal here is to provide a proof of concept of the possibility of using wl peak counts to constrain primordial non - gaussianity , rather than the final quantitative answer to this question .",
    "we perform a hierarchical smoothing of the maps with filters of various sizes , from the largest down to the smallest , as described in @xcite .",
    "this approach removes the problem of ` peaks - in - peaks ' and it also naturally eliminates the dependence of the measured peak function on a particular filter scale . since the median redshift of the source distribution is 0.9 , we adopt a fixed redshift of 0.3 for the matched filter described above . for this redshift",
    ", the scale of the filter varies from corresponding masses of @xmath55 to @xmath56 in the absence of shape noise , and @xmath57 in the presence of it .",
    "the latter lower - limit choice of the filter scale is due to the fact that shape noise contaminates seriously the smaller peaks ; imposing a minimum @xmath46 threshold alleviates but does not remove the contamination .",
    "peaks are detected in the smoothed maps as local maxima , and are assigned a mass as described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac_diff ] presents the main result of this work .",
    "the upper panels illustrate the peak functions measured in the @xmath58 cosmologies , in the absence ( left panel ) and presence of shape noise ( right panel ) . for each @xmath4 model ,",
    "the points are the average of the peak counts measured in all 96 fields and the error bars represent errors on the mean . in the case of shape noise , we select only peaks with a @xmath59 .",
    "we note that the two average peak functions are clearly distinct at the high - mass end , i.e. for @xmath60 .",
    "this is better seen in the lower panels which show the difference of the peak abundance measured in the @xmath61 cosmologies , relative to the @xmath2 peak abundance .",
    "we have minimized the impact of the matched initial conditions of the simulations on the error bars : the fractional difference is computed as an average of the @xmath62 peak abundance in each field ratioed to _ the average _ gaussian peak abundance of 96 fields ( which represents our best model for the true gaussian peak abundance ) , as opposed to the average of the ratio of the non - gaussian and gaussian peak functions measured in the same field .",
    "the latter would have removed the cosmic variance of the fractional difference , because of the matched initial conditions of the simulations from which we built the convergence maps .    just like in the case of the 3d halo mass function , ( see for example @xcite ) , the peak functions for the @xmath4 models show a deviation from the gaussian case . unlike the 3d studies which have presented halo mass functions measured at a single redshift , the peak functions that we show here combine peaks in the redshift range of the source distribution , and therefore are not as regular and symmetric as their 3d counterparts .",
    "the asymmetry is most likely due to modifications of the @xmath46 of peaks by line - of - sight projections , and also by shape noise contamination .",
    "the trend is similar however , with high - mass peaks displaying the largest deviation . for both @xmath4 models ,",
    "this is about 10 - 15% for the largest mass bins",
    "i.e. @xmath63 .    to quantify the significance of the deviation , we perform a @xmath64test . for the fiducial model @xmath2",
    ", we estimate the covariance of the counts in a field .",
    "we use the covariance of the mean to obtain the @xmath65 . for both @xmath66",
    "we find a probability @xmath67 to fit the @xmath66 peak functions with an @xmath2 peak function .",
    "this is also true if we consider only the diagonal elements ( the variance of the mass bins ) instead of the full covariance matrix , and also if we vary the mass bins .",
    "we also use the measured counts to estimate the fisher error that a 14000 @xmath68 wl survey would yield on @xmath4 . assuming all other cosmological parameters known , the forecasted error is @xmath5 for the fiducial value @xmath2 . in the above we considered that the peak abundance scales linearly with @xmath4 , similar to the 3d halo abundance .",
    "the values of the @xmath65 and the fisher error are largely maintained also if we minimize the impact of the matched initial conditions of the simulations , by using the first three simulations to compute the @xmath69 peak function and the last three for the @xmath70 function .",
    "though these results are already very encouraging , it is possible to improve measurements of primordial non - gaussianity from wl surveys even if one considers only peak counts .",
    "the most important is probably the use of tomography , as numerical and analytical studies of the 3d mass functions have shown that deviations of the halo abundance from the gaussian case significantly increase with redshift .",
    "tomography would allow peaks to be separated not only in terms of their @xmath46mass , but also of their redshifts , thus acquiring more sensitivity to @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , one has to beware a possible degeneracy with the amplitude of the matter power spectrum , @xmath71 .",
    "this can be solved by either using as a prior very good knowledge of @xmath72 from other probes , such as the cmb @xcite , wl , and large - scale structures or by combining several observables sensitive to both @xmath4 and @xmath71 , as exemplified in @xcite .",
    "our immediate goals are to further study how wl can be used to constrain primordial non - gaussianity , to build improved @xmath4 estimators from wl observables , and to forecast @xmath4 constraints based on these observables .",
    "for now we convey a simple , yet powerful statement : future wl surveys could detect primordial non - gaussianity of the local type from at least one statistic ",
    "peak counts .",
    "in particular , surveys like euclid and lsst should be able to provide complementary information to the @xmath4 information obtained from the ongoing cmb mission planck.@xcite .",
