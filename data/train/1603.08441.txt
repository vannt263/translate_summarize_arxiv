    "* ) or observations of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence the general structure of the cloud is determined primarily by the interaction of supersonic turbulence and gravity .",

    "the lower limit is close to the transonic scale and to the typical size of dense ( prestellar ) cores .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath7  pc is adopted to ensure that the gas is mainly molecular and isothermal ( with temperature @xmath8  k ) .",
    "this estimate is plausible as well if one takes into account that the largest scale of the inertial range is about 3 times less than the injection scale and adopts for the latter @xmath9  pc , which is above the typical size of giant mcs @xcite .",

    "power - law scaling relations of velocity dispersion @xmath10 and mean density @xmath11 are assumed to hold within the adopted inertial range . applied to mcs and cloud fragments , they were initially discovered by @xcite and therefore are often called `` larson s first and second relations '' . in our modelling , we use these relations in the form : @xmath12 @xmath13 the suggested normalization was chosen in view of the scatter of original data @xcite and of the possible variations of the scaling index @xmath14 @xcite where the classical value of @xcite for incompressible turbulence is taken as a lower limit .",
    "the scaling indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 are interdependent in the proposed model ( see our next basic assumption [ assumptions : equipartition ] ) and thus the variations of @xmath16 generate @xmath17 . to provide consistency of the mean - density scaling relation with such index values and within the inertial range a higher normalization factor of the scale was adopted in equation [ eq_larson_2 ] ( cf .",

    "different estimates of the scaling coefficient @xmath18 can be found in the literature @xcite while @xmath19 is less studied , in particular , due to the variety of ways to define discrete objects in mcs and their density .",
