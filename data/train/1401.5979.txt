    "the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 allowed to establish the effective description of the fundamental laws of nature provided by the standard model of particle physics . the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "has also a strong potential for the discovery or exclusion of new particles , as expected in the different extensions of the standard model . among these ,",
    "many contain top partners ( such as extra - dimensional models , little higgs models , strong electroweak sector and composite higgs models ) .",
    "these new multiplets are typically of vector - like type , therefore vector - like quarks @xcite ( vlq ) constitute a central piece of evidence for a set of models which summarize different possibilities of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "many atlas @xcite and cms @xcite searches have been recently performed in order to discover or set bounds on this type of particles related to the top sector . in many cases , as a simplifying assumption supported by theoretical expectations , only mixing to the third quark generation was considered .",
    "however partial mixing to the light generations should be allowed and is indeed a quite general expectation in the case of an extended ckm matrix ( see @xcite for a general parameterisation and suggestions of lhc signatures of this type ; for a discussion mainly focussing instead on the scenario of dominant third generation coupling to the vector - like quarks see @xcite ; for a general discussion of mixing effects in the limit where the vector - like quarks are integrated out of the effective lagrangian see @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally these studies are now being performed in view of their relevance for phenomenology and model building constraints @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that even a small mixing to the first generation may have important phenomenological consequences as single production would be driven by the first generation couplings due to the large light partonic content in the colliding protons at the lhc .",
    "in such a scenario , the couplings to the third generation and in particular the top quark , would be very relevant in the decay modes , as experimentally these decays give several clear signatures with respect to background processes from the standard model . in this work ,",
    "we consider the electroweak singly produced top partner ( mainly through the flavour changing vertex @xmath1 ) and the decay of the @xmath2 into a top quark and a higgs boson  .",
    "finally , we considered hadronic decays of both the top ( three jets ) and the higgs boson ( two jets ) : we therefore designed our analysis on events with 5 final jets as signature , plus an additional forward jet from the production .",
    "this choice of fully hadronic final states has some important advantages with respect to other choices for the decays of the higgs and top : in the first instance , larger branching ratios lead to a higher number of events . as a second point",
    ", we shall show that a full mass reconstruction is achievable , something not possible in the corresponding leptonic signatures .",
    "from the theoretical side , our analysis is based on a general parameterisation @xcite of models with vector  like quarks .",
    "all different configurations basically depend on the choice of a type of multiplet for the new quarks ( singlet , doublet , triplet , etc . ) and the assignment of hypercharge .",
    "this work is focused on a non - standard doublet containing a top partner @xmath2 of electric charge @xmath3 and an exotic x quark of electric charge @xmath4 .",
    "this doublet corresponds to a shift of one unit of hypercharge with respect to a standard doublet and it is much less constrained by flavor than other choices because it does not contain a bottom quark partner . for a detailed analysis of the phenomenological implications for such a multiplet",
    "see @xcite , while a collider study can be found in @xcite . from a model building point of view , this multiplet is also interesting as it emerges in some strong sector extensions of the standard model  @xcite . for this multiplet a large coupling of the top partner to the first generation of quarks",
    "is phenomenologically allowed  @xcite .",
    "note however that our particular choice is not restrictive apart from the detailed values of branching ratio in the final state we analyse .",
    "in fact , a generic heavy @xmath2 will decay to standard model quarks and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 bosons . as typical minimal masses allowed by the present lhc searches are in the 500 - 700  gev range @xcite from pair production analyses , to a good approximation the decay rates are consistent with the asymptotic predictions of",
    "the equivalence theorem ( in the ratio @xmath8 for decays into @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 of a heavy top quark , but with different ratios if the quantum numbers are not the standard model ones ) . in the case of this non - standard doublet ,",
    "the following decay modes are possible : @xmath9 in the ratio @xmath10 , but depending on the selection of the couplings a given channel @xmath11 can be enhanced ( @xmath12 means quarks of up type @xmath11 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the exotic partner @xmath13 only , due to its exotic electric charge .",
    "the effective lagrangian for a general formulation of vlq in @xcite can be restricted for @xmath2 and @xmath14 type of vector - like quarks in the non - standard doublet : @xmath15\\right\\ }                  -   \\kappa_{t}\\left\\ { \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta_{i}\\xi_{h}^{t}}{\\gamma_{h}^{0}}}\\frac{m}{v}\\left [ \\bar{t}_{l}hu^{i}_{r}\\right ] + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta_{3}\\xi_{h}^{t}}{\\gamma_{h}^{0}}}\\frac{m_{t}}{v}\\left [ \\bar{t}_{r}ht_{l}\\right]\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\                            & + & \\kappa_{x}\\left\\ { \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta_{i}}{\\gamma_{w}^{0}}}\\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left [ \\bar{x}_{r}w^{+}_{\\mu}\\gamma^{\\mu}u^{i}_{r}\\right]\\right\\ } + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected terms proportional to the light quark masses .",
    "the terms proportional to the top quark mass can be also neglected as they typically induce corrections of the order of 10%-20% for @xmath16  gev ( therefore of the order of uncertainty in the present searches ) except for the case of the coupling to the higgs boson , which is therefore explicitly included .",
    "apart from this chiral flipped term to the higgs boson , all other terms have the same chirality .",
    "the lagrangian terms with switched chirality ( l @xmath17 r ) are possible , but suppressed as explained above and detailed in @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the coupling strengths and determine the strength of single production . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are directly linked to the branching ratios ( @xmath22 includes the contributions of the two light generations , which experimentally go both to jets ) : @xmath23 the branching fractions of the top partner @xmath2 only depend on the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath24 , as @xmath25 is a calculable function of the heavy mass scale for the vector - like quarks @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 where we kept the leading order in @xmath28 .",
    "note that in these formulae we kept the decay rates into @xmath6 and @xmath7 arbitrary ( parameterised by @xmath24 , which is equal to 1/2 for the non - standard doublet case ) .",
    "the x partner in the non - standard doublet has a branching which depends on a single parameter @xmath22 .",
    "these approximate but quite robust results allow to describe easily the phenomenology of the non - standard doublet and its single production . for a top partner coming from other multiplets",
    "the situation is not much different in terms of decay modes , as only the extra decay to @xmath5 and quarks will be present , but those to @xmath6 , @xmath7 and quarks which we discuss in the following will be present and non negligible due to the equivalence principle being already a good approximation for vector - like masses @xmath26 of the order of 600  gev or more .",
    "however constraints on different multiplet may be different and in some cases stronger ( we indicated above flavor bounds , but also electroweak precision tests and low energy observables may give important bounds , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in this work we focus on the single production of @xmath2 in association with a light jet .",
    "if only mixing to the third generation were allowed , a single @xmath2 would be produced uniquely in association with a top quark via an s - channel @xmath6 boson , thus leading to typically small cross sections .",
    "on the other hand , allowing a coupling to the up - quark , even if small , opens the possibility for single production in association with a light jet via s- and t - channel @xmath6 exchanges , which offer much larger production rates  @xcite .    in order to study the production and hadronic decay of a singly produced heavy vector - like top",
    ", we have used standard montecarlo simulation tools .",
    "the production of samples was done with madgraph 5 @xcite version 1.5.11 , for both signal and backgrounds . for the signal",
    ", the model was implemented using feynrules @xcite , using the model files in @xcite . finally , the hadronisation of the parton ",
    "level samples has been done with pythia 6 @xcite .",
    "these tools are well known to describe correctly high jet multiplicity final states , specifically an unstable particle ( as the w , z or t ) with up to four additional jets .",
    "cross sections and expected number of events for signal and each background involved in the analysis , at 8  tev for 20  fb@xmath0 , are listed in table  [ tab : xsec ] .",
    ".cross sections and number of events for signal and backgrounds ( after generation cuts ) . branching ratio to full hadronic final state was taken into account for the signal . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the analysis strategy based simulation",
    "was performed with a physical width of the @xmath2 particle preset to @xmath29  gev in the feynrules implementation .",
    "the couplings we used , however , give a physical width of @xmath30  gev .",
    "in general , it is interesting to test how the result we quote may be affected by the physical width of the @xmath2 , which is directly sensitive to the size of the couplings . changing the physical width does not affect any of the selection criteria , but simply affects the final selection based on the invariant mass of the 5 jets .",
    "we checked that , with a width of @xmath30  gev , an opening up to @xmath31  gev as mass window is necessary to include around 2 sigma of the signal .",
    "the @xmath32 does not change significantly within the statistical errors in our analysis .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the physical width of the @xmath2 does not affect significantly this search .",
    "this study was done with the help of madanalysis5 package @xcite .",
    "we have performed a simplified analysis for single production of a vector - like top partner @xmath2 in association with a light jet , with the @xmath2 decaying into a top quark and a higgs boson in the fully hadronic channel .",
    "we thus demonstrated a strategy to extract the signal over the background , considering as a benchmark the 20  fb@xmath0 of data at 8  tev collected within the latest run of the lhc and a benchmark mass around @xmath33  gev , which is within the range of reach for these analyses .",
    "this study suggests the interest in performing a dedicated analysis by the lhc experimental collaborations .",
    "indeed the larger branchings in the hadronic decays give a higher number of signal events and full mass reconstruction is achievable , something which is not possible in the corresponding leptonic signatures studied at present .",
    "this study also shows the importance of even small mixings of the @xmath2 to the first generation as production is driven by these first generation couplings due to the large light partonic content in the colliding protons .",
    "the couplings to the third generation and in particular to the top quark , allow decay modes which give clear signatures with respect to background processes from the standard model .",
