    "a complete description of the quark structure of the proton at leading order in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) requires three flavor - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "the most familiar of these is the unpolarized distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "it describes the quark momentum distribution at infinite momentum . here",
    "@xmath1 is the dimensionless bjorken scaling variable which is the momentum fraction carried by a parton and @xmath2 is the four momentum transfer .",
    "the first moment of @xmath3 provides a measure of the quark vector charge , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath4 .",
    "it has been throughly studied @xcite and is well known for all flavors . in the quark parton model , the @xmath5 structure function is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the second pdf is the longitudinal polarized distribution function @xmath7 which describes the longitudinal helicity distribution of the quarks in a proton polarized parallel to its momentum .",
    "its first moment determines the axial charge of the quarks , _ i.e. _ @xmath8 . in terms of the polarized pdf s ,",
    "the polarized proton structure function is given by @xmath9 . in recent years",
    "much has much has been learned about @xmath10 from studies of polarized dis @xcite .",
    "the third pdf is the transversity distribution function @xmath11 which measures the quark helicity distribution in a proton polarized perpendicular to the proton momemtum at infinite momentum .",
    "it is related to the quark tensor charge through its first moment , _ i.e. _ @xmath12 . until now its properties have been unobserved .    for non - relativistic quarks , @xmath13 and @xmath14 would be identical since by means of commuting rotations and euclidean boosts one can convert a longitudinally polarized proton into a transversely polarized proton at infinite momentum",
    "however , because the internal motion of the quarks is relativistic , this is not true and a comparison of the two pdfs will reflect the relativistic character of quark motion in the proton .",
    "in contrast to its chiral - even partners , @xmath15 and @xmath13 , the transversity distribution is chiral - odd .",
    "this property of transversity makes its measurement difficult since hard qcd and electroweak processes preserve chirality .",
    "it decouples from inclusive dis and other deep inelastic processes .",
    "however , it is of considerable interest because of its unique properties .",
    "the @xmath16 evolution of @xmath17 is much simpler than that of its leading order partners , because it does not couple to gluons .",
    "it is a valence quantity .",
    "lattice gauge calculations can provide reliable estimates of its first moment , the quark tensor charge .",
    "chirality can be conserved in dis processes involving transversity by coupling it to a second chiral - odd function , in the case of drell - yan to the transversity of the beam particle , or in the case of semi - inclusive hadron production to a fragmentation function which also has a chiral - odd structure .",
    "consequently , reactions involving at least two hadrons are required to explore the properties of transversity .",
    "indeed , transversity was first introduced by ralston and soper @xcite in their treatment of the production of muon pairs in polarized drell - yan production .    _ , width=491 ]",
    "perhaps the most striking example of such reactions came almost 10 years ago from the fermilab experiment e704 which reported measuring a large analyzing power @xmath18 in the inclusive production of pions from a transversely polarized proton beam of 200 gev incident on an unpolarized target @xcite .",
    "very strong azimuthal asymmetries were reported for positive and neutral pions which were of opposite sign when measured for negative pions .",
    "two explanations were developed for these results .",
    "the observable @xmath18 is odd under the application of naive time reversal and was assumed therefore to arise from the non - perturbative part of the reaction amplitude .",
    "assuming factorization of the amplitude as shown in figure [ exfig1 ] , either a t - odd fragmentation function or a t - odd distribution function must be involved . in one case",
    "the measured analyzing power was postulated to be proportional to the product of transversity @xmath19 times a collins fragmentation function @xmath20 which is t- and chiral - odd . in the second case the t - odd chiral - even distribution function @xmath21 first postulated by sivers @xcite is coupled to the usual unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath22 .",
    "either a pure collins amplitude @xcite or a pure sivers amplitude @xcite provides a complete fit to the data .",
    "the collins mechanism @xcite is of special interest because it provides a direct probe of @xmath19 .",
    "it produces a correlation in the fragmentation process between the axis of transverse target spin and the vector @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the momentum of final state hadron and @xmath25 is the virtual photon momentum .",
    "( see figure [ kinematics ] . ) because it is a chiral - odd correlation it combines with @xmath19 to provide an observable which is accessible in semi - inclusive dis .",
    "the collins fragmentation function @xmath20 which describes this spin - momentum correlation is chiral - odd and odd under naive time reversal ( t - odd ) , _ i.e. _ time reversal without interchange of the initial and final states .",
    "this `` collins function '' arises from the interference of amplitudes with different imaginary parts and gives rise to hadron single - spin asymmetries .",
    "it describes the influence of the transverse polarization on the momentum component @xmath26 of the hadron transverse to the virtual photon direction which will effect its distribution in the azimuthal angle @xmath27 shown in figure [ kinematics ] .",
    "the characteristic signature for the collins effect in semi - inclusive scattering of an unpolarized lepton beam by a transversely polarized target producing a pseudoscalar meson is a @xmath28 variation in the azimuthal distribution @xcite .",
    "azimuthal spin asymmetries can also be generated by the t - odd sivers distribution function @xmath29 discussed in the previous section , which describes a correlation between the transverse polarization of the target nucleon and the @xmath30 of the struck quark",
    ". this @xmath30 survives fragmentation to be inherited by the hadron @xmath26 .",
    "the familiar unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath31 describes the fragmentation process . because this mechanism is related to a forward scattering amplitude in which the helicity of the target nucleon is flipped ( @xmath32 ) , the angular momentum of the unpolarized quark plays a role .",
    "the polarization state of the virtual photon and the orientation of the lepton scattering plane are irrelevant to the sivers effect .",
    "the characteristic signature for this mechanism is a target spin asymmetry with a @xmath33 variation .",
    "measurements of spin asymmetries with transverse target polarization , permit one to use the variation in the two azimuthial angles @xmath27 and @xmath34 to distinguish the collins and sivers effects .",
    "the quantity measured is the two dimensional asymmetry @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the semi - inclusive luminosity - normalized yield in that target spin state , and @xmath34 always indicates the spin direction of the @xmath37 state . measurement with an unpolarized beam and transversely polarized target is indicated by the ut subscripts .",
    "this asymmetry is then fit with a sum of contributions from two sinusoidal dependences as show above .",
    "monte carlo simulations confirm that extraction of both contributions is made from this fit without measurable cross - contamination even in the case that their magnitudes in the acceptance are very different .",

    "an open - ended cell is fed by an atomic - beam source based on stern - gerlach separation with hyperfine transitions .",

    "the suggestion that transversity distributions should resemble helicities distributions , at least in their general trends is not born out by the data .",
    "to the extend that @xmath74 is positive and @xmath75 is negative the data is similar to model predictions @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of the negative @xmath73 moment appears to be at least as large as that for @xmath70 .",
    "this trend becomes more pronounced as the magnitude of the transverse moments increase at large @xmath1 where valence quark effects dominate , as they do in previously measured longitudinal spin asymmetries .",
    "unlike the case of @xmath70 where u - quark dominance is expected , large negative @xmath73 moments are a surprise , because neither quark flavor dominates @xmath73 production , and one expects @xmath76 in analogy with @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the collins moments shown in the right portion of figure [ fig : asymm ] do not show the increase with increasing @xmath66 which has been predicted @xcite on the basis of a corresponding @xmath66 dependence found for the collins fragmentation function .",
    "the hermes results for the sivers moment are very suggestive .",
    "the value found is positive and nonzero at @xmath78(stat ) for @xmath70 , while the @xmath73 moment is consistent with zero : @xmath79(stat ) .",
    "the large moment for @xmath70 appears to provide the first evidence in leptoproduction for the t - odd sivers parton distribution . because the @xmath70 moment is dominated by @xmath80 quarks , with the sign convention which has been adopted in relating the azimuthal asymmetries to the the parton distributions @xcite a positive asymmetry implies a negative value for the sivers function of this flavor .",
    "however , a substantial contamination of pions from @xmath81 decay are present . studies to date of a small sample of exclusive @xmath81 events in which both pions are detected suggest that this asymmetry extracted for the @xmath70 in the same manner as in the hermes semi - inclusive analysis also has a significant positive @xmath59 asymmetry which could complicate the interpretation of the data for the sivers effect .       top view of the compass spectrometer .",

    "star will measure @xmath96 in a different kinematic region , midrapidity where @xmath97 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature of the hermes data is the unexpectedly large negative @xmath73 collins azimuthal moment . as a result of the proof of factorization@xcite for spin - dependent dis cross sections that involve in leading twist the effects of intrinsic @xmath98 or fragmentation @xmath99 ,",
    "the single - spin asymmetries can be expressed in terms of the usual product of distribution ( _ e.g. _ transversity ) and fragmentation ( _ e.g._collins ) functions .",
    "thus , a reasonable leading order ansatz for the the collins asymmetry is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the electric charge of the quark of flavor @xmath15 .",
    "the negative @xmath73 moment would be explained by a substantial disfavored collins function that describes the fragmentation of @xmath102 quarks to @xmath73 mesons with the opposite sign to that of the favored function . because the collins function acts as an analyzing power for transverse quark polarization , either sign for its amplitude is possible .",

    "the spin of the struck quark is flipped and the string connecting the quark to the remanent diquark is stretched until the first string break as illustrated in the figure .",
    "it is assumed in the model that the @xmath103 pair formed at the break is produced in a triplet p state , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath104 . as indicated in this configuration the leading pion is preferentially produced with momentum into the plane .",
    "the quark spins at the break will have spin orientations opposite to those of the emerging struck quark . applying the same model at the second string break",
    "where a disfavored pion is formed , the disfavored pion will be produced with transverse momentum opposite in direction to that of the leading pion .",
    "this anticorrelation in @xmath105 between the favored and unfavored pions is demonstrated by the jetset simulation shown at the right of figure [ string ] .",
    "the results of this model which is based on lund string fragmentation show , particularly for @xmath106 , a strong back to back azimuthial correlation between favored and unfavored pions . in theoretical representation of the single spin azimuthal asymmetry",
    "as measured , a @xmath98-dependent density function ( _ e.g. _ sivers ) or a @xmath107-dependent fragmentation function ( _ e.g. _ collins ) appears inside a convolution integral over @xmath98 and @xmath107 . when asymmetry data is averaged over @xmath108 , the deconvolution of distribution and fragmentation functions can only be made with some assumption about their dependence on @xmath98 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "however it has been demonstrated @xcite that a model independent extraction can be made by weighting the experimental cross sections by @xmath109 in the integral over this quantity , prior to any moment analysis . with this weighting",
    "the collins asymmetry takes the form @xmath110 where including the @xmath111 in the weight relates the asymmetry to the first @xmath66-moment of the collins function . for the sivers asymmetry",

    "these equations form the basis for subsequent analysis to extract @xmath115 from the collins moment and @xmath116 from the the sivers moment .",
    "extraction of the flavor - dependent sivers function is more accessible than that of transversity , because the required unpolarized fragmentation functions @xmath117 are known independently . a purity technique , previously used to extract longitudinal helicity distributions @xcite can be applied . from equation [ eqn : conv2 ] the sivers asymmetry takes the form @xmath118 where the hadron quark purity @xmath119 is the probability that a quark @xmath15 was struck in an event @xmath120 .",
    "it is a spin - independent quantity which can be calculated from a monte carlo simulation of the fragmentation process .",
    "one can rewrite equation [ eqn : purity1 ] in a matrix form as @xmath121},\\,\\ , { \\vec{a}(x)}={p}{\\vec{q}(x)}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 becomes a vector whose elements are all the integrated measured asymmetries which are to be included in the analysis .",
    "the @xmath123 vector contains the quark transversities .",
    "these quantities are now connected by the purity matrix which contains effective integrated purities .",
    "the determination of the quark transversities from the experimentally determined measured azimuthal asymmetries is reduced to the task of inversion of equation [ eqn : purity1 ] to obtain @xmath123 .",
    "such an analysis of the hermes data is in progress . in principle",
    ", a similar procedure can be used to extract transversity from the collins asymmetries , however , in this case the calculation of the purities is prevented at present by the lack of reliable estimates of the collins fragmentation functions .    an interesting conjecture based on the use of generalized parton distributions to determine",
    "the spacial distribution of partons in the transverse plane @xcite indicates that sivers asymmetries for @xmath102 and @xmath124 quarks should have opposite signs . in this model",
