    "despite many exciting progresses in observations , the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains to be a big puzzle [ see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ] .",
    "in such a situation , it is extremely important to identify some good correlations between the apparent ( easy to measure or calculate ) and intrinsic properties of grbs .",
    "several such correlations have indeed been found .",
    "for example , an anti - correlation between the the peak luminosity and spectral lag of grbs has been found by @xcite , and a correlation between the peak luminosity and the variability of grb lightcurves has been found by fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 , hereafter fr00 ) and reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter r01 ) .",
    "a correlation between the total isotropic energy and the peak energy of the spectrum @xcite , or the collimation - corrected total energy and the peak energy of the spectrum @xcite , has also been discovered .",
    "recently , guidorzi et al . ( 2005 , hereafter g05 ) tested the correlation between the variability and peak luminosity of grbs , using an expanded sample of 32 grbs with measured redshifts .",
    "the definitions of the variability and the peak luminosity are the same , but the size of the grb sample of g05 is about three times bigger than that of r01",
    ". the existence of a correlation was confirmed , but the scatter in the correlation is significantly larger than that found by r01 ( see , however , reichart & nysewander 2005 ) .",
    "although the issue is in debate @xcite , it is clear that with the definition of variability given by r01 , the correlation between the variability and the peak luminosity is not tight .    in this paper , we present a new definition for the variability of grb lightcurves .",
    "we then apply it to a sample of 25 long duration grbs with measured redshifts , whose data are publicly available . we show that , with the new definition of the variability , the correlation between the variability and the peak luminosity of grbs is significantly improved : the data scatter is considerably reduced .",
    "to measure the variability of a lightcurve , first we must define a _",
    "reference lightcurve_. the reference lightcurve should be sufficiently smoother than the original raw lightcurve . since an ultimate model for grbs does not exist yet , there is no first principle guiding us in choosing a reference lightcurve .",
    "what people usually do is to smooth the raw lightcurve with a linear `` box car '' filter ( or moving window ) , which smoothes the lightcurve with linear average ( fr00 ; r01 ) .",
    "here we use a _ savitzky - golay filter _ @xcite to smooth a lightcurve .",
    "the savitzky - golay filter is a more general and more powerful approach for smoothing noisy data than the linear box - car filter .",
    "the basic idea of savitzky - golay filtering is to approximate the underlying function ( i.e. , the reference lightcurve ) within the moving window by a polynomial of higher order .",
    "an advantage of the savitzky - golay filter to the linear filter is that the former preserves high moments while the latter does not .",
    "a savitzky - golay filter is specified by three numbers : the order of the polynomial ( @xmath1 ) , the number of points used to the left of a data point ( @xmath2 ) , and the number of points used to the right of a data point ( @xmath3 ) . to apply the savitzky - golay filter",
    ", the data must be binned with constant spacing . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we use a third order savitzky - golay filter .",
    "that is , we set @xmath4 . the width of the filter , i.e. @xmath5 , is determined with the approach of r01 : @xmath6 is set to be equal to the number of data points corresponding to a timescale @xmath7the time spanned by the brightest @xmath8 of the total counts above the background ( for details see r01 ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath9 most suits our purpose ( rather than the @xmath10 used by r01 and g05 ; see section  5 ) .",
    "so , throughout the paper we use @xmath6 determined by @xmath11 .",
    "we then define @xmath12 $ ] , and @xmath13 . if @xmath6 is odd , we have @xmath14 , i.e. the filter is symmetric about the point to smooth .",
    "if @xmath6 is even , we have @xmath15 , the filter is asymmetric . in this case , we smooth the lightcurve twice : first we use the @xmath2 and @xmath3 defined above , then we switch @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the results are then averaged .",
    "suppose we have obtained a reference lightcurve by applying the savitzky - golay filter to the raw lightcurve .",
    "let us denote the count of the raw data in the @xmath16-th time bin by @xmath17 , the count given by the reference lightcurve by @xmath18 .",
    "the total squared deviation of the raw lightcurve from the reference lightcurve is then @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total number of bins to be summed .",
    "we obtain the intrinsic squared deviation by subtracting the poisson noise @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a statistical weight accounting for the fact that among the @xmath6 data points only @xmath24 are statistically independent .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath25 allows us to apply the variability definition to any lightcurve with @xmath26 .",
    "the summation in equation  ( [ dc2 ] ) is from time @xmath27 ( corresponding to @xmath28 ) to time @xmath29 ( corresponding to @xmath30 ) , enclosing a major part of the lightcurve . following fr00 and r01 , we define @xmath27 to be the start of @xmath31 , @xmath29 to be the end of @xmath31 , where @xmath31 is the time during which the cumulative counts of the grb increase from 5% to 95% above background @xcite .    the poisson noise is calculated by @xmath32 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the background , the factor @xmath34 is the ratio of the background fluctuation to the poisson noise of the background ( given by the reduced @xmath35 of the background fit ) . for grbs detected by  we found that @xmath34 is often significantly larger than unity , indicating that the background fluctuation is quite non - poissonian .",
    "the _ variability _ of the lightcurve is defined by the normalized squared deviation .",
    "we find that the following definition leads to the tightest correlation between the variability and the peak luminosity @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average of the squared deviation , @xmath38 is the net peak count ( i.e. , the background is subtracted ) .",
    "our variability is defined in the observer s frame , so that the information of grb redshift is not needed .",
    "this not only makes the computation of variability simple , but also eliminates an uncertainty arising from the assumption about the dependence of lightcurve variability on photon energy .",
    "the effect of grb redshift was considered by r01 and fr00 who defined their variabilities in the grb frame , but the dependence of variability on redshift turned out to be very weak .    as we applied our smoothing procedure to the grbs in the sample",
    "described in the next section , we found that the tightest correlation between the variability and the peak luminosity is obtained if we iteratively apply the savitzky - golay filter @xmath39 times , where @xmath39 is the integer closest to @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath39 is roughly the number of moving windows contained in @xmath31 ) .    in summary ,",
    "our definition of variability differs from that of fr00 and r01 in the following aspects : ( 1 ) our variability is defined in the observer s frame , while the variabilities of fr00 and r01 are defined in the grb s frame .",
    "( 2 ) we normalize the average of the squared deviation by the squared peak count ( the same as fr00 ) , while r01 normalize the total squared deviation by the sum of squared counts .

    "their peak luminosities are taken from the same paper .",
    "the rest 13 grbs in g05 are not included in our sample for various reasons : either their data are not publicly available ( noticeably the 7 grbs detected by  but not by batse or ) , or their data are incomplete or have too low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "although 050315 and 050319 in g05 were detected by bat/ , their data were not available to us since as this paper was written the archive of  only contained data taken after 1 april 2005 .",
    "the 6 newly added grbs are 030115a , 030528 , 050408 ( from ) , 050802 , 050803 , and 050820a ( from ) .",
    "their peak luminosities are calculated in exactly the same way as in r01 and g05 . for grbs detected by",

    ", peak spectra are extracted from their event files , then fitted with a power law which is sufficient for all cases ( in the energy range 15 - 350 kev ) .    although @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have reported the detection of a second , larger episode of emission from grb 050820a ( by both konus/_wind _ and bat/ ) ,",
    "only the data for the first episode from  are available to us .",
    "thus , for grb 050820a , the variability and peak luminosity listed in table  1 refer to its first episode ( of duration @xmath47 sec ) .",
    "the time bin of each grb lightcurve is as follow .",
    "for grbs detected by batse , except 000131 , the time bin is 64-ms .",
    "grb 000131 does not have a 64-ms lightcurve , so we use its 1.024-sec lightcurve .",
    "although a bin of 1.024-sec is somewhat large , the duration of 000131 is about 100-sec which is much larger than its time bin . for grbs detected by ,",
    "the time bin is 164-ms . while for grbs detected by bat/ , we extract 64-ms lightcurves from their event files available in the public data archive .",
    "as we analyze the grb lightcurves we use the total counts in the energy range specified as follow : 25 - 300 kev for grbs detected by batse , 30 - 400 kev for those detected by , and 25 - 350 kev for those detected by bat/. we have tried to make the range of energy for grbs detected by different instruments have largest overlap .",
    "finally , we remark that for the grbs detected by batse , the lightcurve data in the pre- and post - burst sections were divided equally into 64-ms time bins from their original 1.024-sec time bins .",
    "when we calculate the poisson noise in those sections , we multiply the result by a factor of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) to take into account the reduction in the poisson noise arising from the change in time bin .",
    "we have applied the smoothing procedure described in section  2 to our grb sample .",
    "the obtained variabilities and errors , as well as the number of iterations in applying the savitzky - golay filter , are listed in table  [ grb ] .",
    "the errors of variability are principally caused by photon noises .",
    "however , the uncertainties arising from changing @xmath39 ( see section  2 ) by @xmath50 are also taken into account : we find the changes in the variability for @xmath51 and add in quadrature the maximum to the statistical error .",
    "the peak luminosity versus variability is shown in fig .",
    "clearly a very tight correlation between the two quantities exists , with only one prominent outlier : grb 030329 .",
    "given the large error in its variability , it is unclear if grb 980425which is famous for its smallest redshift , lowest peak luminosity and least total energy , and association with sn 1998bw @xcite  is off trend as in other kind of correlations ( e.g. , the total energy - peak energy correlation ) .",
    "in fact , the error in variability is larger than or about the same value as the variability itself for 980425 and 030528 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we have made a least-@xmath35 linear fit to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the peak luminosity in erg / sec . to take into account both the errors in @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we have made use of the program fitexy in @xcite .",

    "since the errors in @xmath56 are infinite for 980425 and 030528 , these two grbs do not contribute to the total @xmath35 .",
    "grb 030329 was not considered due to its large offset . with 980425 , 030329 , and 030528 excluded , the total number of grbs in the final sample to fit is 22 .",

    "the three contours enclose the regions containing , respectively , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 of normally distributed data .",
    "the highly elongated shape of the contours indicates that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are highly correlated .    for any measured value of @xmath56 , equation  ( [ lllv ] )",
    "predicts a value of @xmath55 .",
    "the error in the predicted @xmath55 comes from two sources : the error in @xmath56 , and the uncertainties in @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath76    generally , the errors are asymmetric in the upward and downward directions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath77 the upward error due to uncertainties in @xmath64 and @xmath65 , by @xmath78 the downward error .",
    "that is , the predicted log luminosity is @xmath79 , if @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the numerically calculated values of @xmath77 ( filled circles ) and @xmath78 ( open circles ) versus the predicted log luminosity . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we find that @xmath81 when @xmath82 and @xmath83 are not close to zero , which leads to @xmath84 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is minimized at @xmath86 , i.e. at @xmath87 , consistent with the numerical results .    for the convenience of application of the @xmath88 relation  ( [ lllv ] ) to the prediction of grb s peak luminosity , we have attempted to approximate the numerical results for @xmath85 by several analytic formulae .",
    "the results are summarized in appendix  a , and represented by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "now we apply the above results to grb 030329 to check how far it deviates from the @xmath88 relation . from table  1 , for grb 030329 we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 . submitting @xmath91 into equation  ( [ lllv ] )",
    ", we obtain a predicted log luminosity for grb 030329 : @xmath92 . since grb 030329 lies below the straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the relevant error in the predicted log luminosity is determined by @xmath78 and @xmath93 . by equation  ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "we have @xmath94 .",
    "then , by equation  ( [ sigma ] ) , the total error in the predicted luminosity is @xmath95 . from table  1 ,",
    "the measured luminosity of grb 030329 is @xmath96 , with an upward measured error @xmath97 that is smaller than the error in the predicted log luminosity .",
    "so , grb 030329 deviates from the correlation ( the straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) by @xmath98 .",
    "to make a quantitative comparison of our results to that of g05 , we need a parameter that measures the scatter of data points around the best fit model .",

    "as mentioned in section  2 , we have chosen @xmath160 , and @xmath39 to be the integer closest to the ratio @xmath40 . with this choice , for the grb sample described in section  3 ( excluding 980425 , 030329 , and 030528 ) , we obtained @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the two dashed lines are obtained by shifting the solid line upward / downward by @xmath163 ) .",
    "if we followed r01 and g04 to choose @xmath164 , we would obtain @xmath165 and @xmath166 in the linear fit to @xmath167 .",
    "a slightly larger value of @xmath121 indicates that the correlation is slightly looser .    to test how sensitive the results are to the choice of @xmath39 ,",
    "let us redefine @xmath39 by the integer closest to @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is a parameter that is set to be the same for all grbs in the sample .",
    "when @xmath170 , we return to the definition that we have adopted .",
    "we now let @xmath169 vary from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , and calculate the corresponding @xmath121 in the least-@xmath35 fit to @xmath88 .",
    "the calculated @xmath121 versus @xmath169 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , which shows that the results are stable to the choice of @xmath39 .",
    "that is , the variance of fit does not change drastically with a small change in @xmath169 .",
    "the figure also shows that @xmath173 is around the minimum of @xmath174 .    , with respect to the choice of @xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath169 , which the @xmath11 in the definition of @xmath39 is multiplied by , is set to be the same for all grbs in the sample .",
    "the variabilities presented in this paper correspond to the case @xmath175 . ]",
    "we have presented a new definition for the variability of grb lightcurves .",
    "the new variability is defined in the observer s frame , and the lightcurve is smoothed with the savitzky - golay filter . the former makes it easy to apply the procedure to all grbs with well measured lightcurves ( i.e. , with a significant signal - to - noise ratio , and a reasonable size of time bin  neither too large to erase the variability on short timescales , nor too small to introduce too large poisson noises ) , without referring to the redshift information .",
    "we have applied our smoothing procedure to a sample of 25 long duration grbs with measured redshifts and publicly available data . a very tight correlation between the variability and the peak luminosity",
    "is found , with only one prominent outlier : grb 030329 . excluding 030329 , 980425 , and 030528 ( the latter two are due to their too large errors in variability ) , a linear fit to the log of variability and the log of peak luminosity",
    "is obtained ( equations  [ lllv ] and [ ab ] ) , with @xmath161 .",
    "the smallness of the reduced @xmath35 indicates that the data scatter is very small ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we note that , although the existence of a second , larger episode of emission from grb 050820a has been claimed @xcite and we have only made use of the data for its first episode , grb 050820a fits the relation perfectly well .",
    "our results are a significant improvement to that of g05 ( as well as that of fr00 and r01 ) , who used a different definition of variability and obtained @xmath176 .",
    "an analysis on the overlapping sample of 17 grbs ( after grbs 980425 and 030329 being excluded ) shows that the scatter in our data is smaller than that in g05 s data by a factor of @xmath177 , measured by the deviation of fit ( section  5 ) .",
    "the improvement to the correlation is caused by using a new smoothing procedure and a different normalization in the definition of our variability , not by neglecting the effect of grb redshift .",
    "r01 have shown that the dependence of variability on the redshift is extremely weak .",
    "the fact that a very tight correlation between the peak luminosity and the variability is obtained without including the corrections to the variability from the grb redshift also leads us to believe that such corrections are not necessary .",
    "a remarkable feature of the correlation that we have found is that it does not rely on the corrections to the luminosity from the collimation of grb jets .",
    "in other words , the peak luminosity used above is simply the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity . if this correlation is confirmed by future bursts",
    ", it will provide a convenient calibration to grb luminosity and distance .",
    "grb 030329 , which is considered to be a firm case for the connection of grbs with supernovae @xcite , is offset from the correlation by 7 @xmath46 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "although the cause is not clear , we have noticed that 030329 and 050525 differ from other grbs in the sample in the following way : their lightcurves consist of two distinctly separated pulses with each containing at least 30% of total counts .",
    "motivated by this observation and the fact that grb 050820a fits the relation well although only the first episode of its emission has been used , we have recalculated the variabilities of 030329 and 050525 by dividing the smoothing window by a factor of 2 ( i.e. , dividing the @xmath6 obtained from @xmath11 by 2 ) but keeping @xmath39 unchanged .",
    "we obtained @xmath178 for 030329 , which well fits the solid straight line in fig .  1 .",
    "for 050525 , we obtained @xmath179 , which fits the straight line equally well as the value listed in table  1 . whether this treatment is correct",
    "must be tested when more grbs with lightcurves similar to that of 030329 and 050525 are available .",
