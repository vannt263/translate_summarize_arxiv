    "the deterministic cellular automaton corresponding to the zero - temperature case of domany s stochastic ising ferromagnet on the hexagonal lattice @xmath1 @xcite can be considered as a simplified version of a continuous time markov process where an independent ( rate @xmath19 ) poisson clock is assigned to each site @xmath20 , and the spin @xmath21 at site @xmath9 is updated when the corresponding clock rings . the rule for updating the spin is to flip it if and only if it disagrees with two or three ( a majority ) of its neighbors .",
    "this model has been studied both rigorously and numerically in  @xcite ; the numerical results about two critical exponents obtained there strongly suggest that the dependent percolation model defined by the limiting spin configuration @xmath22 is in the same universality class as ordinary independent percolation .    in the zero - temperature domany model studied here ,",
    "the rule for updating the spins is unchanged , but the timing is different .",
    "this model has been previously used in numerical simulations  @xcite , and its dynamical as well as percolation properties have been studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the existence of a percolation transition for the dependent percolation models associated with the spin configurations @xmath13 at time @xmath23 , for all @xmath14 $ ] , is proved ; in  @xcite , it is shown that for any @xmath24 , the crossing probabilities converge to cardy s formula  @xcite when the lattice spacing @xmath25 is sent to zero ( the _ continuum scaling limit _ ) , as in the case of independent percolation ( at least on the triangular lattice @xmath26",
    "@xcite ) ; in  @xcite , the continuum scaling limit is analyzed in terms of cluster boundaries and is shown to be the same as for ordinary independent critical percolation on @xmath26 .",
    "this last result strongly suggests that also the critical exponents defined at the critical point should be the same as for independent percolation .",
    "indeed , due to the above mentioned result , one can use properties of the stochastic loewner evolution  @xcite ( which describes the scaling limit of ordinary critical percolation cluster interfaces ) to compute certain critical exponents in the continuous model corresponding to the scaling limit .",
    "but unfortunately , the connection between critical exponents in the continuous and discrete models is not straightforward ; more work and further results on the discrete model would be required to relate the discrete critical exponents with the continuous ones ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "similar models on different lattices have been studied in various papers ; see , for example ,  @xcite for models on @xmath27 and  @xcite for a model on the homogeneous tree of degree three .",
    "such models are also discussed extensively in the physics literature , usually on @xmath27 ( see , for example ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "their interest is tied to the fact that they can be obtained as zero - temperature limits of stochastic ising models , a special class of markov processes whose transition probabilities / rates are chosen so that the gibbs measures ( for some hamiltonian ) at temperature @xmath28 are invariant for the markov process . in systems where there are multiple ( infinite - volume ) gibbs measures for @xmath28 below some critical @xmath29 , a subject of considerable interest is the @xmath30 behavior of the spin configuration @xmath31 ( with temperature @xmath32 ) when the initial state is chosen from the ( unique ) gibbs measure at @xmath33 . studying the limiting case where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the standard choice in much of the statistical physics literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    ", it was shown that there is a percolation transition with @xmath36 for all values of @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "we remark that @xmath37 is _ not _",
    "@xmath38 for @xmath39 , since the critical probability for independent site percolation on the hexagonal lattice is strictly larger than @xmath38 , therefore the system is _ driven _ to criticality by the dynamics , and this after just one time step .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens in the case of the continuous time model studied in  @xcite , where it is believed that criticality is achieved again for @xmath40 , but only at time @xmath41 .",
    "nonetheless , the nature of the percolation transition , in terms of critical exponents and/or scaling limits , is presumed to be the same in the different models .",
    "in this section , we give a more detailed description of the model and present , for completeness , results that were proved in  @xcite which motivate ( and will be used in ) the next section , where the main results of this paper are presented .    consider the homogeneous ferromagnet on the hexagonal lattice @xmath42 ( embedded in @xmath43",
    "so that the elementary cells are regular hexagons with side length @xmath19  see , for example , figure  [ star - tri ] ) with states denoted by @xmath44 , and with ( formal ) hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the sum over all pairs of neighbor sites , each pair counted once .",
    "we write @xmath47 for the set of three neighbors of @xmath9 , and indicate with @xmath48 the change in the hamiltonian when the _ spin _ @xmath21 at site @xmath9 is flipped ( i.e. , changes sign ) .",
    "partition the sites of the hexagonal lattice @xmath42 into two subsets , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in such a way that all three neighbors of a site @xmath9 in @xmath49 ( resp . , @xmath50 ) are in @xmath50 ( resp . , @xmath49 ) . by joining two sites of @xmath49",
    "whenever they are next - nearest neighbors in the hexagonal lattice ( two steps away from each other ) , we get a triangular lattice ( the same with @xmath50  see figure  [ star - tri ] ) .",
    "the synchronous dynamics that we consider here is such that all the sites in @xmath49 ( resp . , @xmath50 )",
    "are updated simultaneously .",
    "we now define the cellular automaton @xmath51 , with state space @xmath52 , which is the zero temperature limit of a model of domany  @xcite , as follows :    * the initial state @xmath53 is chosen from a bernoulli product measure @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",

    "* at even times @xmath59 , the spins in @xmath50 are updated according to the same rule as for those in @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath60 exists with probability one  @xcite and , like @xmath13 for @xmath61 , defines a dependent percolation model on @xmath1 .",

    "* once the initial spin configuration in @xmath8 is chosen , the dynamics is completely deterministic .",
    "* a spin can no longer flip once it belongs to either a loop or a `` barbell '' of constant sign , where a barbell consists of two disjoint loops connected by a path .",
    "there is an alternative but equivalent way of describing the discrete time dynamics as a deterministic cellular automaton ( with random initial state ) on the triangular lattice @xmath26 ( corresponding to the set @xmath8 of sites ) .",
    "given some site @xmath63 , group its six @xmath64-neighbors @xmath65 in three disjoint pairs @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath64-neighbors , and so on for the other two pairs .",

    "the models on the hexagonal and on the triangular lattice are related through a _ star - triangle transformation _ ( see figure  [ star - tri ] and , for example , p.  335",
    "of  @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics on the triangular lattice @xmath64 is equivalent to the zero - temperature domany dynamics on the hexagonal lattice @xmath42 when restricted to the sublattice @xmath50 for even times @xmath77 .    to see this , start with @xmath64 and construct an hexagonal lattice @xmath78 by means of a star - triangle transformation such that a site is added at the center of each of the triangles @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath78 may be partitioned into two triangular sublattices @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "one can now see that the dynamics on @xmath64 for @xmath84 and the zero - temperature domany dynamics on @xmath78 restricted to @xmath82 for even times @xmath77 are the same .",
    "[ int ]    an immediate consequence of this equivalence between the two cellular automata is that the two families of percolation models that they produce are also equivalent in an obvious way through a star - triangle transformation . to be more precise , the percolation models defined on @xmath64 for times @xmath84 are the same as those defined on @xmath50 by the zero - temperature domany model for even times @xmath77 .",
    "we now present ( without proof ) the results of  @xcite on the zero - temperature domany model .",
