    "given @xmath1 a smooth algebraic surface of degree @xmath2 , one can obtain information on @xmath3 by considering it as a branched cover of @xmath0 .",
    "it is well  known that for @xmath4 a generic projection , the branch locus is a plane curve @xmath5 which is , in general , singular , and its singularities are nodes and cusps .",
    "let @xmath6 be a generic affine portion of @xmath7 .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that if the braid monodromy factorizations ( bmf ) of the branch loci of two surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 are hurwitz - equivalent , then the surfaces are diffeomorphic",
    ". moreover , if the factorizations are not hurwitz - equivalent , then @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not projectively deformation equivalent .",
    "therefore , the bmt invariant ( the equivalence class of a bmf ) is really in the  middle \" , i.e. , between the diffeomorphism equivalence and the projectively deformation equivalence . we need to find an algorithm that decides whether two bmfs are equivalent . in general , it was shown in @xcite that there is no finite algorithm which determines whether two positive factorizations are hurwitz- equivalent .",
    "however , @xcite did not examine the particular case of the bmfs .",
    "therefore , we have to extract the information contained in the braid monodromy factorization via the introduction of more manageable ( but less powerful ) invariants .",
    "two discrete invariants are induced from the bmf of the branch curve ",
    "@xmath10 : the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) and its subquotient : the fundamental group of the galois cover of @xmath3 ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we say that two surfaces are fundamental group equivalent ( fge ) if their fundamental groups of the complement of the branch curve are isomorphic .    in this article we present two surfaces , which are embeddings of a k3 surface with respect to two different linear systems ; therefore they are diffeomorphic . due to the nature of the particular linear systems ,",
    "these embedded surfaces are not projectively deformation equivalent .",
    "it is also known that any two k3 surfaces can be abstractly deformed one into the other .",
    "thus one can raise the questions : are the surfaces fge ?",
    "are the fundamental groups of the corresponding galois covers isomorphic ?",
    "here we prove that although the latter groups are isomorphic , the surfaces are not fge .",
    "therefore , these surfaces are also not bmt  equivalent , which means that the surfaces are not in the same component of the hilbert scheme of linearly embedded k3 surfaces .",
    "* acknowledgments * : we are very grateful to ciro ciliberto , for pointing out the degeneration used for the  magician \" k3 surface and for other helpful discussions .",
    "we also wish to thank meirav amram for her fruitful remarks .",
    "in this section we recall the main definitions and constructions regarding the two embeddings of the @xmath11 surface , and the braid monodromy factorization ( = bmf ) related to a ( branch ) curve .",
    "we begin with the introduction of the two embeddings of a @xmath11 surface .",
    "recall that the surfaces with kodaira dimension which equals to 0 , that are simply connected , have in fact trivial canonical bundle , and are called @xmath11 surfaces .",
    "the invariants for such surfaces are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the moduli space of all @xmath11 surfaces is @xmath15-dimensional .",
    "most @xmath11 surfaces are not algebraic ; the algebraic ones are classified by an infinite collection ( depending on an integer @xmath16 ) of @xmath17-dimensional moduli spaces .",
    "the general member of the family has a rank one picard group , generated by an ample class @xmath18 with @xmath19 ; the general member of the linear system @xmath20 is a smooth curve of genus @xmath21 , and this linear system maps the @xmath11 surface to @xmath22 as a surface of degree @xmath23 .",
    "for example , a @xmath11 surface is a smooth quartic surface in @xmath24 .",
    "the quartic surfaces in @xmath24 form the family with @xmath25 .",
    "the integer @xmath21 is called the _ genus _ of the family .    the first embedded surface is a @xmath11 surface of genus 9 , embedded in @xmath26 by the pillow ( 2,2)-pillow degeneration ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the resulting embedding can be degenerated into a union of 16 planes , such that the whole degenerated object would ",
    "resemble a pillow \" ( see figure 1 for clarification ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the embedded @xmath11 surface , and by @xmath27 the degenerated surface ( see @xcite for an explicit definition of a degeneration ) .",
    "+    the degeneration process has a  local inverse \"  the regeneration process ( see an explanation in the following subsection ) , and for it we need to fix a numeration of vertices ( and the lines ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this is done in the following way ( see figure 3 ) :     +    the 16 planes meet each other along a total of 24 lines , each joining 2 of the 10 coordinate points .",
    "we numerate the lines as follows : if @xmath28 has endpoints @xmath29 and @xmath30 has endpoints @xmath31 , then @xmath32 if @xmath33 or @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this gives a total ordering of the lines , which we interpret as a numbering from 1 to 24 , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "+    under a general projection @xmath36 , each of the 16 planes is mapped isomorphically to @xmath0 .",
    "the ramification locus @xmath37 of @xmath38 is a local isomorphism . here",
    "@xmath37 is exactly the 24 lines .",
    "let @xmath39 be the degenerated branch curve .",
    "it is a line arrangement , composed of the image of the 24 lines .",
    "the second embedded surface is also an embedded @xmath11 surface of genus 9 in @xmath26 .",
    "we call this surface the  magician \" surface , since its degeneration  resembles \" a magician s hat . the surface and its degeneration into a union of 16 planes are described in @xcite",
    ". the dual graph of the degenerated surface is presented explicitly in ( * ? ? ?",
    "430 ) - and from it we can build the degenerated surface ( see figure 5 ) .     +    denote by @xmath9 this embedded surface , and by @xmath40 the degenerated surface .",
    "we can depict a 2-dimensional graph of @xmath40 , where the boundaries are identified ( see figure 6 ) :     +    once again , we numerate the vertices and then the edges .",
    "we note that the extreme edges of the graph @xmath40 are actually 4points : singular points in the degenerated surface which are the intersection of four planes . in order to regenerate it ( see @xcite for the possible degenerations of this point ) , we need to numerate the vertices in such a way that the number of  entering \" and  exiting \" lines from these points will be equal .",
    "therefore , we numerate them as vertices 5 and 6 . following the symmetry appearing in the graph , we numerate the other vertices as follows ( see figure 7 ) :     +    note that @xmath40 also contains 24 intersection lines and 10 singular points .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the degenerated branch curve with respect to a generic projection @xmath42 .",
    "since every two @xmath11 surfaces are diffeomorphic , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are also diffeomorphic .",
    "note that the hilbert scheme of embedded linearly normal k3 surfaces can be reducible .",
    "this is indeed the case here  the picard group pic@xmath8 is generated by @xmath43 ( where @xmath18 is the hyperplane class ; see @xcite ) and pic@xmath9 is generated by @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two polarized k3 surfaces are projectively deformation equivalent if and only if there is a diffeomorphism which carries the hyperplane class to the hyperplane class . as indicated above , this is not the case .",
    "we show in the following sections that these surfaces are also not bmt  equivalent , and that the fundamental groups of complement of the branch curve can also be used in order to differentiate between irreducible components of the hilbert scheme .",
    "thus it is a topological invariant that arises in algebro - geometric considerations .",
