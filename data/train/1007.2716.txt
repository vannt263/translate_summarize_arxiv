    "we consider @xmath17 as identically and independently distributed random variables leading to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a pdf describing the disorder generated in the experiment .",
    "experimentally , there are two main ways of introducing disorder , corresponding to two different pdf s . on the one hand , superposing two incommensurate optical lattices yields a shifted @xmath26 distribution as demonstrated in appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "the distribution is bounded by a maximum disorder strength @xmath27 .",
    "this approach is used , for example , in the setup by fallani _",
    "@xcite , where two laser beams with wave lengths @xmath28 nm and @xmath29 nm are superposed .",
    "since these two wave lengths are highly incommensurable the disorder can be regarded as truly random , see ref .  .",
    "alternatively , disorder can be generated by superposing a laser speckle field  @xcite to the regular optical lattice . in this case",
    ", one obtains an exponential distribution @xmath30 where @xmath31 specifies the mean disorder strength @xcite . in our calculations the distribution is additionally shifted about its median @xmath32 to avoid modifications of the chemical potential due to disorder .",
    "the exponential distribution is asymmetric and unbounded and thus , strictly speaking , the mott phase , which is controlled by the extrema of the distribution @xcite does not occur anymore .",
    "however , the goal of the present paper is to mimic the results of the experimental measurements , for which the effects of the tail of the distribution are too small to be observable .",
    "therefore we introduce a cut off for the disorder distribution of @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , realizations far off the median are not considered .",
    "we employ the variational cluster approach ( vca ) to investigate the phase boundary and spectral properties of the disordered bh model .",
    "vca has been originally proposed for fermionic systems by m.  potthoff _ et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been extended to bosonic systems in refs .",
    "the mathematical concept for the treatment of disordered systems by means of vca can be found in ref .",

    "we present the first application of vca for disordered systems and on top of that , as a new contribution to vca theory , we extend the so - called @xmath34-matrix formalism @xcite to a formulation suitable for disordered systems .",

    "the important point is that the functional @xmath38 can be computed exactly for a restricted set of self - energies associated with a so - called reference system , described by an hamiltonian @xmath39 , which shares its interaction part with the physical system .",
    "typically , the reference system @xmath39 is a decomposition of the physical system into independent clusters of a given size @xmath40 , so that its green s function can be determined numerically .",
    "disorder is treated by introducing a reference system which shares , in addition to the interaction part , the disorder distribution with the physical system .",
    "the expression for the averaged grand - potential within vca then reads @xcite : @xmath41-    { \\mbox{tr}}\\ln [ - { \\mathsf{g}}_p'^{-1}]\\ ; ,   \\label{eq : omp}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the exact disorder averaged grand potential and green s function of the reference system , respectively , which can be easily evaluated numerically with high accuracy .",

    "@xcite it has been discussed for a pure system that it is expedient for the evaluation of the traces in eq.([eq : omp ] ) to use the @xmath34-matrix formalism .",

    "for the numerical evaluation by means of vca we use @xmath73 disorder configurations , a reference system of size @xmath74 , and the vca parameters @xmath75 .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 is an additional on - site energy located at the boundaries of the cluster , whose introduction drastically improves the results , as shown in ref .",
    "the artificial broadening parameter is chosen to be @xmath77 for spectral functions and @xmath78 for densities of states . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "the occupied part of the single - particle spectral function is experimentally accessible by high - energy bragg spectroscopy . for the pure system",
    "we obtain the well - known cosinelike shaped bands reminiscent of the dispersion of free particles on a lattice . for increasing disorder strength @xmath27 the minimal gap between the occupied and the unoccupied band shrinks .",
    "in addition , the bands become broader as the poles of the green s function for a specific wave vector @xmath79 are distributed over a large energy range .",
    "this behavior can also be seen in the density of states .",
    "furthermore , for large disorder the bands seem to split in two sections separated by a pseudogap around @xmath80 .",
    "this is a peculiarity of this disorder configuration which to some extend resembles a binary distribution .",
    "an ordered binary distribution would double the unit cell thus producing a true gap at @xmath80 .",
    "experimentally the gap @xmath7 present in mott phase can be determined for instance by lattice modulation @xcite or by bragg spectroscopy @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the amount of energy transferred to the system is related to the width of the central peak observed in time of flight images @xcite .",
    "the width of the central peak is measured for various energies leading to the excitation spectrum . indeed for increasing disorder strength",
    "@xmath27 a broadening of the excitation band has been observed @xcite which is qualitatively in agreement with our results for the spectral function . in addition , it could be shown experimentally that the weight moves to lower excitation energies for increasing @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "however , it is rather difficult to extract the precise value of the gap from the measured excitation spectra . strictly speaking",
    ", the gap @xmath7 is defined as the energy difference of the lowest lying poles in the occupied and unoccupied bands , respectively . yet ,",
    "our results show , that these poles quite generally carry only very little spectral weight .",
    "this means that it is virtually impossible to detect them in the experiment .",
    "for this reason , it might be useful to introduce the notion of a gap @xmath8 , that corresponds to the experimental situation and is determined by the distance between the maxima of the spectral weight observed in the center of the brillouin zone . in fig.[fig : gap ] we compare @xmath7 [ fig.[fig : gap ] ] with @xmath8 [ fig.[fig : gap ] ] which is obviously always larger than @xmath7 . for increasing hopping strength",
    "@xmath13 the gap @xmath8 decreases , however , it still remains finite ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) at values of @xmath13 for which the gap @xmath7 determined from the smallest excitation energies is already almost zero .",
    "therefore , a peak at finite energy will be observed in the experimental data , even when the system is already in the bose - glass phase .",
    "additionally , it is important to mention that the smallest excitation energy gap @xmath7 can be predicted analytically for systems with infinitely many disorder realizations . in this case",
    "@xmath7 is controlled by the maximum disorder strength @xmath27 only .",
    "in particular , the phase boundary is shifted by @xmath82 as there exist always rare regions where the chemical potential is either increased or decreased by @xmath27 @xcite . here , however , we take into account a finite number of @xmath83 random values for the on - site energies @xmath17 leading to larger gaps , since it is very unlikely that all values @xmath17 of one realization @xmath50 are close to the extreme cases @xmath84 .",
    "this resembles more closely the experimental situation in which only a limited number of disorder realizations can be detected .",
    "the second kind of disorder we are addressing in this paper follows the shifted exponential distribution , which is generated by superposing a laser speckle field .",
    "spectral properties of the bose - hubbard model for this disorder distribution are shown in fig.[fig : sfexp ] .    , and @xmath85 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the spectral function @xmath68 evaluated for @xmath86 and panel ( b ) shows the densities of states for various disorder strengths @xmath87.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in contrast to the disorder realized by the superposition of two incommensurate optical lattices , the spectral signatures evaluated for the exponential distribution clearly exhibits an asymmetric shape .",
    "this becomes particular visible when comparing the densities of states for various disorder strengths , see fig.[fig : sfexp ] . in particular , the poles are smeared out toward higher excitation energies and thus reflect the tail of the exponential distribution .",
    "no pseudogap behavior around @xmath80 is observed here , due to the shape of the exponential distribution which is in contrast to the @xmath26 distribution not peaked at the edges .",
    "in the present work we investigated for the first time spectral properties of the disordered bose - hubbard model . in view of a realistic description of the experimental results , we focused on disorder distributions which are relevant for ultracold gases of atoms in optical lattices .",
    "in particular , we studied the differences between disorder realized by the superposition of incommensurate laser fields with the one obtained by laser speckle fields . in both cases we evaluated spectral functions and densities of states and showed that the resulting spectral weight strongly depends on the underlying shape of the disorder distribution .",
    "furthermore , we determined the gap present in the mott phase for disorder generated by incommensurate optical lattices . on the one hand",
    ", we evaluated the gap @xmath7 from the minimal excitation energies of the system and on the other hand we determined the gap @xmath8 from the minimum peak distance in the spectral weight located at the center of the brillouin zone . whereas @xmath7 can not be observed directly in the experiment since the low - energy excitations carry very little spectral weight , @xmath8 is directly measurable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 is always larger than @xmath7 and thus @xmath8 remains finite even at the mott to bose - glass transition . in our calculations",
    ", we neglected the harmonic trap potential present in the experiments with ultracold gases of atoms . in principle",
    ", this effect can be included in our formalism , however , with a significantly major effort which goes beyond the goal of the present work .",
    "there are two cases in which neglecting the trap potential is justified . as in the ordered case",
    ", one can expect for sufficiently small disorder strength the trap potential to lead to multiple ringlike regions which are alternately mott gapped and gapless .",
    "quite generally , one should be able to choose the parameters so that the volume of the gapless regions is much smaller than the one of the @xmath88 mott region in which we are interested . in this case",
    ", the spectrum will display a nonvanishing weight within the gap originating from the gapless regions .",
    "however , we expect this to be small enough , at least for @xmath89 , so that the peaks defining the experimental gap @xmath8 remain discernible",
    ". alternatively , spectroscopy experiments probing the system locally should be able to probe directly the mott insulating region with no contributions from the gapless areas .",

    "in this appendix we show that the potential distribution , which results from the superposition of two optical lattices , follows a shifted @xmath26 distribution .",
    "in particular , we focus on the experimental setup of fallani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used for the main optical lattice a laser at wavelength @xmath90 nm .",
    "disorder is generated by superposing an additional lattice created from a weak laser beam at @xmath29 nm . the resulting potential is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the spatial position , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are related to the depth of the potential generated from the laser beams at @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the corresponding recoil energies . in this appendix ,",
    "the lattice depths @xmath93 and @xmath94 will always be stated in units of their recoil energies .",
    "the depth @xmath94 of the disorder - inducing wave is related to the maximal disorder strength @xmath27 by @xmath99 .",
    "since the wave lengths @xmath95 and @xmath96 are incommensurable the disorder imitates a true random behavior @xcite .",
    "here we reconstruct the histogram of the disorder distribution and find a mathematical expression , which reproduces the behavior of these physical systems .",
    "in the experiments typical values for the lattice depths are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , see ref .",

    "it can be seen that the on - site energy varies for distinct lattice sites mimicking a random potential .",
    "actually , the parameter @xmath94 just scales the disorder and thus our considerations are valid for arbitrary disorder strength @xmath27 . to evaluate a histogram of the energy distribution we subtract the disordered potential at the lattice sites from the pure potential and shift the difference by its mean @xmath27 .",
