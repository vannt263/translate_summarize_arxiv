    "in galactic contexts , we venture to formulate a theoretical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) disc problem to explore possible large - scale structures and dynamics of stationary mhd density waves in a composite system of stellar and magnetized interstellar medium ( ism ) gas discs .",
    "the two gravitationally coupled discs are treated as ` fluid ' and ` magnetofluid ' respectively and are both expediently approximated as razor - thin singular isothermal discs ( sids ) with the gaseous sid being embedded with a coplanar azimuthal magnetic field . for the gravitational effect of a massive axisymmetric dark matter halo , we prescribe a background composite system of two coupled partial sids ( syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al . 2000 ;",
    "lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 ; shen & lou 2003 ) . in our model analysis , we construct stationary aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral mhd perturbation configurations in a composite system of two sids with flat rotation curves , and attempt to relate various morphologies of disc galaxies , including barred and lopsided , barred and normal spiral structures . for possible observational diagnostics , we derive phase relationships among perturbation patterns of the stellar surface mass density , the gas surface mass density and the azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "this introduction serves two purposes .",
    "the first one is to provide a general background information relevant to the problem at hand and the second one is to give reasons of pursuing this mhd disc problem .    in a pioneering study of a composite system of stellar and gas discs coupled by gravity ,",
    "lin & shu ( 1966 , 1968 ) used a stellar distribution function and a gas fluid disc description to derive and analyze the local dispersion relation of galactic spiral density waves .",
    "since then , there have been extensive theoretical studies on perturbation configurations and stability properties of a composite disc system , mainly in galactic contexts .",
    "kato ( 1972 ) investigated oscillations and overstabilities of density waves using a formalism similar to that of lin & shu ( 1966 , 1968 ) . in a two - fluid formalism ,",
    "jog & solomon ( 1984a , b ) examined the growth of local axisymmetric perturbations in a composite disc system .",
    "bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) studied the influence of a gas disc on spiral modes in a two - fluid model framework .",
    "vandervoort ( 1991a , b ) studied the influence of interstellar gas on oscillations and stabilities of spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the two - fluid approach was also adopted in a stability study of a two - component disc system with finite disc thickness by romeo ( 1992 ) .",
    "the analysis for morphologies of disc galaxies was performed by lowe et al .",
    "for the stability of a composite disc system , different effective @xmath13 parameters ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) have been suggested using a two - fluid formalism by elmegreen ( 1995 ) and jog ( 1996 ) .",
    "recently , lou & fan ( 1998b ) used the two - fluid formalism to study properties of open and tight - winding spiral density - wave modes in a composite disc system .",
    "lou & shen ( 2003 ) studied stationary global perturbation structures in a two - fluid system of sids and , instead of a redefinition of a different @xmath13 parameter , shen & lou ( 2003 ) offered a more practical @xmath14criterion for the axisymmetric instability in a composite sid system .",
    "a rich class of disc problems involves stability properties of sids .",
    "there have been numerous studies on this subject since the pioneering work of mestel ( 1963 ) ( e.g. zang 1976 ; toomre 1977 ; lemos , kalnajs & lynden - bell 1991 ; lynden - bell & lemos 1999 ; goodman & evans 1999 ; charkrabarti , laughlin & shu 2003 ) .",
    "specifically , syer & tremaine ( 1996 ) made an important breakthrough to derive semi - analytic solutions for stationary perturbation configurations in a class of sids .",
    "shu et al . ( 2000 ) obtained stationary solutions for perturbation configurations in an isopedically magnetized sid with a flat rotation curve . through numerical explorations",
    ", they interpreted these stationary aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral configurations as onsets of bar - type and barred - spiral instabilities ( see also galli et al .",
    "different from yet complementary to the analysis of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , lou ( 2002 ) performed a coplanar mhd perturbation analysis in a single background sid embedded with an azimuthal magnetic field , from the perspective of stationary fast and slow mhd density waves ( fmdws and smdws ; fan & lou 1996 ; lou & fan 1998a ) .",
    "lou ( 2002 ) also derived a form of magnetic virial theorem for an msid and suggested the ratio of rotation energy to the sum of gravitational and magnetic energies to be crucial for the onset of bar - like instability in an msid system . in galactic contexts , it would be more realistic to consider large - scale structures and dynamics in a composite system of stellar and magnetized ism discs . as a first step ,",
    "lou & shen ( 2003 ) made a foray on this model problem , constructed stationary aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral configurations in such a composite sid system and further examined axisymmetric instability properties ( shen & lou 2003 ) . in disc galaxies , the ism disc is magnetized with the magnetic energy density being comparable to the energy densities of thermal gas and of relativistic cosmic - ray gas ( e.g. lou & fan 2003 ) .",
    "information of galactic magnetic fields can be estimated by synchrotron radio emissions from spiral galaxies .",
    "for such a magnetized composite system , mhd will play an indispensable role and reveal more realistic aspects of dynamic and diagnostic information . these important problems ( shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 ) are not only interesting by themselves , but also serve as necessary steps for establishing an even more realistic model . motivated by this prospect ( lou & fan 1998b ; lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 )",
    ", we construct here stationary perturbation configurations for aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral cases in a composite system of a stellar sid and a coplanarly magnetized gaseous msid , and discuss their stability properties .",
    "we adopt a relatively simple formalism for a composite system involving fluid and magnetofluid discs coupled by gravity .",
    "we provide in section 2 an mhd description for the coplanarly magnetized gaseous msid , obtain conditions for background axisymmetric equilibrium state for both stellar sid and gaseous msid , and derive linearized equations for coplanar perturbations . there",
    "exist aligned and unaligned classes of global mhd perturbation solutions ; they are analyzed in section 3 and section 4 , respectively .",
    "the exact solutions of stationary perturbations , their stability properties and their corresponding phase relationships among perturbation variables are examined and summarized in section 5 .",
    "details are included in appendices a@xmath15e .",
    "it would be physically more precise to adopt a distribution function formalism in dealing with a stellar disc especially in terms of singularities and resonances ( e.g. lin & shu 1966 , 1968 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for the present purpose of modelling large - scale stationary perturbation structures and for mathematical simplicity ( lou & shen 2003 ) , it suffices to start with the fluid - magnetofluid formalism , including an mhd treatment for the gaseous msid ( lou 2002 ; lou & fan 2003 ) . in this section",
    ", we present the basic equations for the fluid - magnetofluid system consisting of a stellar sid and a gaseous msid . for flat rotation curves , conditions on the background rotational equilibrium with axisymmetry can be derived .",
    "we then obtain the linearized equations for coplanar mhd perturbations in the composite msid system .",
    "the two sids , located at @xmath16 , are both approximated as infinitesimally thin . in our fluid - magnetofluid treatment ,",

    "the interlacing of optical and magnetic spiral arms in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 6946 was first revealed by beck & hoernes ( 1996 ) in the inner disc portion with an almost rigid rotation .",
    "similar features of displaced optical and radio arms were also reported in portions of spiral galaxies ic 342 ( e.g. krause et al . 1989 ) and m83 ( ngc 5236 ; e.g. sukumar & allen 1989 ; neininger 1992 ; neininger et al . 1993 ) .",
    "these observational results led fan & lou ( 1996 ) to introduce theoretical concepts of slow mhd density waves ( smdws ) and fast mhd density waves ( fmdws ) in magnetized spiral galaxies ( lou & fan 1998a ; lou , yuan & fan 2001 ) and to show that perturbation enhancements of azimuthal magnetic field and gas mass density of smdw are phase shifted by @xmath384 relative to each other . however , several wavelet analysis on multi - wavelength data of ngc 6946 ( e.g. frick et al . 2000 , 2001 ) further revealed large - scale spiral arms extended well into the outer disc portion with a more or less flat rotation curve ( e.g. tacconi & young 1989 ; sofue 1996 ; ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ) , that seems to challenge earlier arguments that smdws are largely confined within the inner disc portion of almost rigid rotation .    for coplanar mhd perturbation structures of stationary logarithmic spirals in an msid model with a flat rotation curve , lou ( 2002 )",
    "has shown the existence of smdws . for stationary smdws of lou ( 2002 ) ,",
    "logarithmic spiral enhancements of gas surface mass density and azimuthal magnetic field are phase shifted by about @xmath360 . as effects of long - range self - gravity , magnetic field and disc differential rotation are included in the model analysis , smdw patterns in a single msid model can indeed support extended manifestations of interlaced optical and magnetic spiral arms that persist well into the outer disc portion with a flat rotation curve ( lou & fan 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , lou ( 2002 ) further suggested that significant phase shifts between @xmath363 related to stationary logarithmic spiral structures of fmdws within a single msid .",
    "given idealizations of our composite msid model , the three possible stationary logarithmic spiral patterns might be conceptually relevant to magnetized spiral galaxies .",
    "specifically , for the upper two solution branches of @xmath208 and @xmath209 , the phase difference of the stationary logarithmic spiral enhancements between azimuthal magnetic field and surface mass gas density is between @xmath360 , supporting the idea that interlaced optical and magnetic spiral arms may persist through the inner disc portion to the outer portion ( with a phase difference @xmath385 ) . for a sufficiently large @xmath288 in the tight - winding or wkbj regime , this phase difference approaches @xmath386 , while for a sufficiently small @xmath288 in the open regime , this phase difference approaches @xmath358 .",
    "note that in our modelling , the phase difference of @xmath363 occurs mainly through the @xmath210 solution branch that is usually unphysical with @xmath89 being negative .",
    "as sketched earlier ( e.g. lou & fan 1998a , 2000a , b ; lou et al .",
    "2002 ) , a typical disc galaxy involves a stellar disc , a magnetized gas disc and a massive dark matter halo . our theoretical model of a composite msid system ,",
    "idealized and simplified in many aspects , does contain these basic elements .",
    "with necessary qualifications in mind , it is then of considerable interest to reveal possible types of large - scale structures and their characteristic features in the stationary mhd density - wave scenario and relate them to galactic diagnostics and observations .    for the @xmath208 solution with largest value of @xmath89 , stationary logarithmic spiral density arms in gaseous msid and in stellar sid are spatially out of phase ; in particular , spiral gas density and magnetic field arms",

    ", this case appears comparable to interlaced optical and synchrotron radio arms of ngc 6946 ( beck & hoernes 1996 ; fan & lou 1996 ; frick et al . 2000 , 2001 ; lou & fan 2002 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath362 ,",
