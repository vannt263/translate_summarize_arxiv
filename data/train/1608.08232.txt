    "the explicit form of the resulting zak phase of the @xmath10-th band is @xmath13 where bz represents the 1d brillouin zone , and @xmath14 is the periodic part of the bloch function @xmath15 . the total zak phase @xmath0 is obtained by summing @xmath16 over filled bands .",
    "the zak phase was endowed with a physical meaning with the modern definition of the polarization @xmath17 , introduced by vanderbilt and king - smith.@xcite the ambiguity of the classical polarization , which depends on the shape of the unit cell boundary,@xcite was resolved by redefining the electronic part of the polarization @xmath18 as an integral of wannier functions over the whole space , rather than over a unit cell . with this definition , one can accurately predict the bound surface charge , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the surface orientation , measured in capacitance experiments.@xcite furthermore , the electronic polarization @xmath21 along @xmath20 is related to the zak phase ( evaluated along @xmath20 with @xmath22 kept fixed ) via @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the 2d brillouin zone projected to the 2d plane perpendicular to @xmath20 , @xmath22 is the momentum component in this plane , and @xmath25 the number of filled bands .    in the currently active study of topological aspects of materials,@xcite",
    "the zak phase has been utilized as a topological number to classify various genuine 1d topological insulators , as well as effective ones , such as those obtained by fixing one or two momenta of 2d or 3d hamiltonians;@xcite it was naturally extended to the concept of non - abelian wilson loops in the multi - band case and used for classifications of topological insulators with inversion or non - symmorphic symmetries and topological crystalline insulators.@xcite furthermore , the zak phase has been widely used for the z@xmath26 classification of inversion symmetric 1d systems where it is quantized to @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( mod @xmath29).@xcite in this case , the conventional bulk - boundary correspondence states that there are boundary modes if the zak phase is nontrivial , @xmath30 , while @xmath31 is considered a trivial insulator without surface modes.@xcite recent work , however , pointed out that the zak phase depends on the gauge choice of choosing the origin of the real space , and how one defines boundaries of the unit cell , although it is invariant under gauge transformation of the form @xmath32.@xcite this means that the zak phase itself is not a well - defined topological number since it can not characterize the bulk uniquely . in an attempt to resolve this ambiguity , atala et",
    "al.@xcite suggested that the difference of the zak phase between different states could be a proper topological number , and juan et .",
    "al.@xcite revised the zak phase by adding a unit cell dependent term such that the resultant z@xmath26 number plays the role of a gauge invariant topological number . in spite of these issues ,",
    "the conventional bulk - boundary correspondence using the zak phase has been successfully applied in many cases@xcite .",
    "furthermore , additional conditions for the applicability of the correspondence to finite systems have been given , such as that terminated edges should not break the inversion symmetry of the bulk @xcite or that the finite system should be commensurate with the bulk s unit cell@xcite .",
    "however , the necessity of those assumptions has never been demonstrated in general 1d systems , and we even find a counterexample for the former one in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ]  b where the conventional bulk - boundary correspondence using @xmath0 does not work even in the presence of inversion symmetry both in the bulk and the terminated system . in this paper",
    ", we clarify these issues by providing a more detailed analysis of the zak phase , concentrating on general 1d tight - binding models . to this end",
    ", we split the zak phase into two terms , the _ intra - cellular _ and _ inter - cellular _ zak phase ( this splitting was earlier introduced by kudin et al.@xcite ) , and provide them with their proper physical interpretations .",
    "the intra - cellular zak phase @xmath5 describes the electronic part of the classical polarization of the bulk s unit cell , and the inter - cellular zak phase @xmath1 represents the difference between the net weight of the wannier functions in the left and right sides of the 1d system with respect to a unit cell boundary , with their centers belonging to opposite sides as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : left - right ] .",
    "we further show that , if the system is terminated , this interpretation of the inter - cellular zak phase leads to an accurate prediction of the extra charge accumulations in a region around the surface .",
    "we assume that these surface regions are commensurate with the bulk s unit cell , and large enough that effects of the termination are negligible deep inside the bulk . here , the extra charge accumulation is just the total charge in the surface region including ionic contributions .",
    "note that it is a different quantity from the _ bound surface charge _ introduced by vanderbilt et al.@xcite , which can be measured in capacitance experiments .",
    "for instance , the bound surface charge can be nonzero even when the surface regions remain neutral while the extra charge accumulation vanishes in this case .",
    "although we have obtained a general relation between @xmath33 and the extra charge accumulation around surfaces for any translationally invariant systems , it can not generally be used to count the number of surface modes in the gap below the fermi level , since it includes charge densities both from bulk bands and surface states ; however , we show that it is possible if inversion symmetry is respected in the unit cell . in this case , there are @xmath2 ( mod 2 ) surface modes below the fermi level in a finite system , if it is commensurate with an inversion symmetric unit cell of the bulk and @xmath1 is evaluated from this commensurate unit cell . we can replace @xmath1 with @xmath0 if the real - space origin is chosen to be located at the inversion center of the unit cell because @xmath5 , an origin - dependent quantity , vanishes in this case .",
    "in other words , the conventional bulk - boundary correspondence using the total zak phase is valid if there exist an inversion symmetric bulk unit cell commensurate with the finite system and the real - space origin is at the inversion center .",

    "let us consider a general translationally - invariant one - dimensional system described within the tight - binding approximation .",

    ", @xmath43 is the @xmath44-th atomic orbital centered at @xmath45 which is the position of the @xmath36-th atomic site in the @xmath42-th unit cell .",
    "atomic orbitals at the same site are orthonormal and the overlaps between orbitals on different sites are assumed to be exponentially vanishing in accordance with the tight - binding condition.@xcite the coefficients @xmath46 are obtained from solving the eigenvalue problem with the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we choose the gauge in which every atomic orbital in the @xmath42-th unit cell has the same phase factor @xmath47 in ( [ eq : bloch ] ) ; the coefficients @xmath48 then satisfy the periodic boundary condition @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a reciprocal lattice vector.@xcite in another widely used gauge , the phase factor for the orbitals at @xmath45 is instead given by @xmath51.@xcite in this case , the same bloch eigenfunction @xmath52 is obtained by replacing the coefficient @xmath46 with @xmath53 , which satisfies the twisted boundary condition @xmath54 . while both gauges yield the same zak phase , since they describe the same bloch eigenfunction @xmath52 , the former allows for a natural separation of the zak phase into the intra- and inter - cellular part .",
    "the zak phase , following kudin et al.@xcite , can be split into two terms .",
    "the @xmath10-th band zak phase   is obtained from the lattice periodic part of the bloch function @xmath55 which satisfies the orthonormality condition @xmath56.@xcite the inner product @xmath57 in the zak phase is defined as @xmath58 with @xmath59 a unit cell .",
    "then , the zak phase is split into the intra- and zak phase as @xmath60 where @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the index of the unit cell @xmath59 , and @xmath63 ( see appendix  [ app : zak phase ] for further details ) .",
    "note that @xmath64 depends on the real - space origin while @xmath65 does not , because @xmath46 , being an element of the eigenvector of the momentum space representation of the hamiltonian , is origin - independent . to give a physical interpretation of the zak phases just introduced , we start by relating the electronic part of the classical polarization of the unit cell to the zak phase .",
    "we consider contributions from each filled band separately . for the @xmath10-the band , we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the electronic density corresponding to the @xmath10-th band .",
    "that is , @xmath68 can be evaluated from the intra - cellular zak phase up to mod @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , we give a physical interpretation of the zak phase . to this end",
    ", we employ the wannier functions given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 they satisfy the orthonormality condition @xmath71 .",
    "note that in 1d the wannier function @xmath72 is in general guaranteed to be exponentially localized around a position in the @xmath42-th unit cell@xcite while , in 2d and 3d , this is true if and only if the chern number of the band vanishes.@xcite then , we express the @xmath10-th band zak phase , via the inverse transformation of  , as @xmath73 by fixing a point @xmath74 at the boundary between neighbouring unit cells , which we assume for concreteness to be between the @xmath75 and @xmath76 unit cells , the system is split into the left ( @xmath77 ) and right ( @xmath78 ) regions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : left - right ] . with these definition ,",
    "the zak phase can be split into two parts as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 further details are given in appendix  [ app : zak phase ] . from ( [ eq : wannier_rl ] ) and ( [ eq : wannier_lr ] ) , we note that @xmath82 represents the charge weight in the @xmath77 region of all wannier functions with their centers belonging to the @xmath78 region , and vice versa for @xmath83 . finally , their difference in the @xmath77 region is simply expressed by @xmath84 where the sum is over the filled bands . in the @xmath78 region",
    ", this difference is just given by @xmath85 .",
    "due to the translational symmetry of the system , this result is valid for any unit - cell boundary .",
    "also , this quantity does not depend on the position of the origin since the inter - cellular zak phase does not as mentioned previously .",
    "note that , from the point of view of the electronic density , every unit cell is neutral and there is no extra charge in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 regions of the bulk .",
    "however , we want to eventually obtain the extra charge accumulation around the surfaces when the system is terminated ; we demonstrate how it is related to @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the next section .",
    "in this section we consider a terminated system , divided it into three regions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : finite_system ] : the left surface region ( @xmath88 ) from @xmath89 to @xmath90 and the right surface ( @xmath91 ) region from @xmath92 to @xmath93 , separated by the bulk region ( @xmath94 ) from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "we choose @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath41 all large enough that there are no boundary effects in the bulk , and all regions are commensurate with the bulk s unit cell , namely they do not contain any partial unit cells . while the extra charge accumulation in the surface region is defined as the additional charge over the bulk s charge distribution , it is equivalent to the total charge including ions in this region , because of the commensurability condition and the neutrality of the bulk s unit cell .",
    "finally , we assume that the finite system is also insulating because otherwise partially filled degenerate states at the fermi level would yield ambiguity in evaluating physical quantities depending on which states we choose to be occupied .",
    "then , we show that , if the surface region is commensurate with the bulk s unit cell , the extra charge accumulation @xmath99 in the left ( right ) surface region of a neutral 1d insulator is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "the overall strategy for the demonstration of the relation ( [ eq : extra_charge_acc_inter_zak ] ) is as follows .",
    "we prepare a set of orthonormal wave functions that are related to the set of occupied eigenfunctions of the finite system by a unitary transformation , following vanderbilt et al.@xcite all of these states are localized , i.e. , wannier - like , such that their characteristic widths are much smaller than sizes of the three regions .",
    "first , there are exchanges of weights of the wannier functions between the surface and bulk region across their boundary as expressed by @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the previous section .",
    "then , from the orthonormality and localized feature of the prepared basis set , we show that the total charge in the left and right surface region should be @xmath102 and @xmath103 modulo @xmath4 .",
    "the orthonormal localized wave functions that we employ for the description of the terminated system are given by @xmath104 while the wannier functions are the proper basis set for the infinite system , after the termination we need to construct this new set of basis wave functions that satisfy the open boundary condition .",
    "@xmath105 span the same hilbert space as the @xmath106 occupied eigenstates of the terminated system denoted by @xmath107.@xcite first , we pick all occupied wannier functions from the unit cell @xmath108 ( in the left surface region ) to @xmath109 ( in the right surface region ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is arbitrary but chosen to be far enough from the surfaces so that corresponding wannier functions satisfy the boundary conditions with exponentially vanishing error .",
    "we then replace the wannier functions around the surfaces with another set of wave functions that satisfy the open boundary condition ; these we denote by @xmath110 and @xmath111 around the left and right boundary each .",
    "the set of wave functions in ( [ eq : localized_wavefunctions ] ) can always be made orthonormal through the gram - schmidt orthonormalization process.@xcite the charge density of the occupied electrons in the terminated system is given by @xmath112 . since @xmath113 and @xmath114 , as orthonormal bases , span the same hilbert space of occupied states , they are related by a unitary matrix , and the electronic charge is rewritten as @xmath115 the total charge in the left surface region , which is the extra charge accumulation , is then evaluated as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the total ionic charge in the left surface region  we assume that the left - end of the system is at @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the position of the right boundary of the @xmath42-th unit cell . in this region , integrals of @xmath120 s in ( [ eq : electronic density ] ) vanish , while the sum of integrals of @xmath121 s , which are well localized to the right and left surface , is an integer number @xmath122 . then , @xmath123 becomes @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "since all the wannier functions are normalized , we have the identity @xmath126 this leads to the conclusion @xmath127 where @xmath128 . when we apply ( [ eq : wannier_rl ] ) and ( [ eq : wannier_lr ] ) to ( [ eq : extra charge der1 ] ) and ( [ eq : extra charge der2 ] ) , we take @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , which is an approximation justified by the fact that the wannier functions are exponentially localized in space and that the surface regions can be taken large enough .",
    "also , the role of @xmath74 in ( [ eq : wannier_rl ] ) and ( [ eq : wannier_lr ] ) is taken by @xmath133 in ( [ eq : extra charge der1 ] ) and ( [ eq : extra charge der2 ] ) . in the same way",
    ", the extra charge accumulation in the right surface region is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "as in ref .  , we are not interested in the integer numbers @xmath136 and @xmath137 which can not be determined from the bulk . instead",
    ", we conclude that the inter - cellular zak phase can predict the extra charge accumulation in the surface region modulo @xmath4 as described in ( [ eq : extra_charge_acc_inter_zak ] ) . finally",
    ", we remark on the difference between the bound surface charge and the extra charge accumulation .",
    "the bound surface charge @xmath138 is a quantity measured in a capacitance measurement and is related to the modern definition of the polarization by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the surface orientation ( @xmath139 for the left ( right ) edge in the 1d case).@xcite the bound surface charge of the total charge density @xmath140 of the finite system is evaluated explicitly as@xcite @xmath141 for the bound surface charge at the left edge , and @xmath142 at the right edge , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are arbitrary positions in the middle of the finite system far away from the surfaces . as shown in appendix [ app : bound charge ] , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are independent of @xmath143 and @xmath144 . to clearly compare the bound surface charge and the extra charge accumulation ,",
    "we choose them as @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "then the left and right bound surface charge becomes @xmath149 and @xmath150 derivations of the above are given in appendix [ app : bound charge ] .",
    "the first terms of ( [ eq : left bound charge ] ) and ( [ eq : right bound charge ] ) are exactly @xmath151 because @xmath133 and @xmath152 are far enough from the edges so that @xmath140 can be considered a bulk charge density .",
    "we call them the _ classical bound surface charges _ @xmath153 because in classical electrodynamics they are the bound surface charges in a dielectric material with a uniform dipole distribution through the whole finite system . on the other hand , the second terms of ( [ eq : left bound charge ] ) and ( [ eq : right bound charge ] ) are just the total charge in the left and right surface regions , which are equal to the extra charge accumulations in those regions in the neutral systems .",
    "consequently , we have shown that the bound surface charge consists of two contributions , one from the bulk s dipole moment , and the other from the extra charge accumulation .",
    "this is consistent with the splitting of the zak phase into the intra- and inter - cellular zak phase .",
    "also , it indicates that the modern polarization is actually composed of two kinds of polarizations , one is the classical one from the bulk s dipole moment , and the other is polarization from the extra charge accumulations at opposite edges .",
    "this conclusion is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : finite_system ] .",
    "our general statement about the number of surface modes in the gap of a finite 1d insulator with charge neutrality is as follows : there are @xmath2 ( mod 2 ) surface modes below the fermi level if there is inversion symmetry both before and after termination , and the finite system is commensurate with the bulk unit cell used for the calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "we justify our general statement in the light of the physical interpretation of the inter - cellular zak phase @xmath1 . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", the inter - cellular zak phase explains the amount of the extra charge accumulation around the edge which is closely related to the surface modes , while the intra - cellular zak phase , as a bulk dipole moment , has nothing to do with the surface modes .",
    "first , we note that if the bulk respects inversion symmetry , @xmath33 is quantized to @xmath28 .",
    "when the real - space origin is at one of the inversion centers , the total zak phase @xmath0 is quantized to @xmath28 while its intra - cellular part vanishes because the dipole moment of the bulk unit cell is zero in this case . therefore , @xmath154 is also quantized to @xmath28 , and it is independent of the choice of the origin as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : reinterpretation ] .",
    "the surface modes are the eigenstates generated in the bulk gaps as a result of the edge termination .",
    "as described in the previous section , they are exponentially localized at one of the edges . due to inversion symmetry ,",
    "if we have a surface state localized at the left edge , we always find its counterpart localized at the right edge with the same energy .",
    "the degeneracy might increase if the system preserves additional symmetries such as the time reversal symmetry .",
    "we proceed to the justification of our general statement by examining two different cases .",
    "one is when the fermi level of the finite system is not at any of the surface modes , so that the finite system is also an insulator . and , the other is the case when the fermi level is at the partially filled degenerate surface modes .",
    "first , let us consider the case when the finite system is already insulating . then",
    ", the only allowed value of the total charge accumulations is @xmath155 due to charge neutrality and inversion symmetry . according to ( [ eq : extra_charge_acc_inter_zak ] )",
    ", the zak phase should be 0 ( mod @xmath29 ) in this case .",
    "since every surface mode has an inversion partner with the same energy , there should be an even number of surface states below the fermi level .",
    "this means the general statement holds for insulating phases with inversion symmetry .",
    "second , we consider the case when the fermi level is located at the surface modes . in this case",
    ", we can not use the results of the previous section since there we assume the finite system is insulating .",
    "however , we can resolve this obstacle by opening tiny gaps between degenerate surface modes without changing the total number of surface modes in the bulk gap .",
    "we assume that this can be done by applying local perturbative potentials on both edges that break symmetries corresponding to those degeneracies .",
    "for instance , different on - site potentials at opposite edges would break the degeneracy responsible for inversion symmetry .",
    "similarly , a local zeeman field could be used to break spin degeneracy .",
    "let us investigate the dependence of the surface modes on the tiny inversion symmetry breaking , which is relevant for the quantization of the extra charge accumulations on the edges as explained below .",
    "this is achieved by applying an on - site potential @xmath156 to the first unit cell and @xmath157 to the @xmath41-th unit cell of the finite system where @xmath156 is nonzero but small compared with the bulk gap .",
    "then , the eigenstates at opposite edges have different energies , and it is impossible to construct surface modes localized to both edges simultaneously from them . as a result , the eigenstate of each lifted surface mode is localized to only one of the left and right edges .",
    "this implies that each surface mode yields and integer charge @xmath158 or @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the contribution of the @xmath36-th surface mode to the extra charge accumulation in the left ( right ) surface region . after taking into account the inversion symmetry breaking , we assume that other perturbative potentials would not affect this property of the lifted surface modes .",
    "on the other hand , the charge distribution calculated from the bulk band continuum is insensitive against this kind of local perturbation due to its bulk character .",
    "so , the charge distribution of the bulk band continuum maintains almost the same form as the unperturbed inversion symmetric system . in the unperturbed inversion symmetric system , the extra charge accumulation from the bulk band continuum",
    "can only take values of @xmath161 or @xmath162 where @xmath163 is an integer , because the total charge of the finite system should be an integer multiple of @xmath4 and the system has inversion symmetry . here , @xmath164 is the contribution of the bulk band continuum to the extra charge accumulation in the left ( right ) surface region .",
    "note that although we slightly break the inversion symmetry to make the system insulating , its presence in the unperturbed system is essential for the constraint on @xmath164 .    if @xmath165",
    ", the total charge accumulations originating from surface modes on both sides should be @xmath166 to maintain neutrality .",
    "this means that there is an odd number of surface modes below the fermi level in the main gap where the fermi level lies because there were even number of occupied surface modes in other gaps before breaking inversion symmetry , and we have assumed that this number is unchanged by the symmetry breaking perturbations . also , due to the same reason , this implies that we have an odd number of surface modes below the fermi energy in the main gap before breaking those symmetries .",
    "in the perspective of the inter - cellular zak phase , the fact that the extra charge accumulation @xmath167 is a half - integer multiple of @xmath4 implies that the inter - cellular zak phase should be a half - integer multiple of @xmath29 according to ( [ eq : extra_charge_acc_inter_zak ] ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the number of surface modes is equal to @xmath168 mod 2 in this case .    in similar fashion , when @xmath169 , the surface modes extra charge accumulations on both edges should be @xmath170 to maintain charge neutrality , implying that there is an even number of surface modes in the main gap and that the inter - cellular zak phase is even .",
    "so , the number of surface modes is again equal to @xmath168 mod 2 in this case .",
    "finally , we note that this bulk - boundary correspondence can be restated by using the zak phase when the real - space origin is at an inversion center .",
    "this is because the intra - cellular zak phase becomes zero ( mod @xmath29 ) according to ( [ eq : intra cellular zak ] ) , so that the zak phase is identical to the inter - cellular zak phase in this case .    ,",

    "in this work , we have demonstrated that the inter - cellular zak phase @xmath1 can predict whether the number of surface modes below the fermi level in 1d insulators is even or odd , when the commensurate bulk unit cell respects inversion symmetry .",
    "while the zak phase itself can not do this due to its arbitrariness depending on the choice of the real - space origin and the unit cell , we have shown that @xmath1 , as an origin - independent quantity , can be exploited for this bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "although @xmath1 also depends on the unit cell choice it is not arbitrary once we select a unit cell that is commensurate with the finite system . our bulk - boundary correspondence using @xmath1 was justified with a microscopic interpretation of @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",

    "thereby , our work also clarifies the conditions under which the conventional bulk - boundary correspondence using the zak phase works .",
    "we expect that the extra charge accumulation can be measured by scanning quantum dot microscopy ( sqdm).@xcite sqdm offers three - dimensional images of electrostatic potentials down to the subnanometer level from which one could infer the total amount of its source charge .",

    "<S> we demonstrate this by first verifying that @xmath3 ( mod @xmath4 ) is equal to the extra charge accumulation in the surface region for a general translationally invariant 1d insulator , while the remnant part of @xmath0 , the intra - cellular zak phase @xmath5 , corresponds to the electronic part of the dipole moment of the bulk s unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> second , we show that the extra charge accumulation can be related to the number of surface modes when the unit cell is inversion symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> this bulk - boundary correspondence using @xmath1 reduces to the conventional one using @xmath0 when the real - space origin is at the inversion center . </S>",
    "<S> our work thereby clarifies the usage of @xmath0 in the bulk - boundary correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> we study several tight binding models to quantitatively check the relation between the extra charge accumulation and the inter - cellular zak phase as well as the bulk - boundary correspondence using the inter - cellular zak phase . </S>"
