    "the equivalence principle is the cornerstone of classical gravitational theories , from newtonian gravitation to general relativity .",
    "the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) states that the geodesic paths followed by free falling bodies are the same , regardless of their energy content . in the other words , the motion of a falling body",
    "is determined only by the surrounding geometry and not by the body s own properties  @xcite . in the weak field limit , this principle leads to an universal acceleration of the falling bodies , a fact that is rooted in two principles of the newtonian gravitation : the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses and universality of the newton s gravitational constant @xmath8 .",
    "since the proposal of wep , this hypothesis has been extensively tested by a large diversity of experiments , including torsion - balance experiments  @xcite , motion of solar system bodies  @xcite , spectroscopy of atomic levels  @xcite and pulsars  @xcite ; which always lead to strong limits on possible deviations .",
    "however , recent developments in theoretical physics are systematically indicating that many modern attempts to obtain a quantum version of the gravitational theory lead to the prediction that the equivalence principle will be violated in some scale ( see for example  @xcite ) . in this sense , improving the current limits on the vep provides a diagnostic tool in probing very high energy theories of quantum gravity , which are almost inaccessible to conventional experiments .",
    "one of the methods to probe vep is through the neutrino oscillation phenomena .",
    "the effect of vep on neutrino oscillation was first studied by gasperini  @xcite and later developed by others in  @xcite .",
    "the original model was intended to solve the solar neutrino problem  @xcite , which is now in excellent agreement with the framework of massive neutrinos with the msw effect  @xcite . however , despite its failure to explain the solar neutrino problem , vep can contribute to flavor oscillation as a subdominant effect and so can be probed by solar neutrinos  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , supernova  @xcite , cosmic  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrinos .",
    "essentially , the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation to vep originates from the fact that the flavor states of neutrinos are coherent superposition of mass eigenstates and so act as interferometers which are sensitive to differences in the coupling of mass states to gravitational field .",
    "the bottom line is that vep effectively changes the mass - squared differences by adding a term proportional to the square of neutrino energy ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , by the increase of neutrino energy the vep effects become stronger and so the potential to discover / constrain vep increases . among the known perpetual sources of neutrinos ,",
    "atmospheric neutrino energies extends up to very high energy and so provides a unique opportunity to probe vep .",
    "the construction of huge ( km@xmath10 scale ) neutrino telescopes , with the completed icecube detector at the south pole as an example , fulfills the detection of these high energy atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "currently two sets of high energy atmospheric neutrino data are available from icecube experiment : the  ic-40 \" data set in the energy range ( 100 gev - 400 tev )  @xcite and  ic-79 \" data set in the range ( 20 gev - 10 tev )  @xcite , with the total number of events : @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . in this paper",
    "we utilize these data in the search of vep in the most general phenomenological model accommodating it . by analyzing these data",
    "we obtain the most stringent upper limit of vep parameters , some of them are @xmath5 orders of magnitude stronger than the current limits",
    ".    this paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ model ] we review the phenomenology of the oscillation of massive neutrinos in the presence of vep and current upper limits on vep parameters . in section  [ sec : vep - energy ] we study in detail the effect of vep on neutrino oscillation .",
    "also , we show the numerical calculation of oscillation probabilities and their interpretation in terms of analytical approximations . our analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data of icecube is presented in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "conclusion is provided in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "different approaches for the implementation of vep in the neutrino sector of standard model exist .",
    "originally , vep was introduced as a mechanism which induces flavor oscillation even for massless neutrinos . for massless neutrinos , although the neutrino states do not couple directly to gravitational field , during the propagation the gravitational redshift develops a phase difference between the components of the superposition of gravitational eigenstates which leads to flavor oscillation  @xcite . in this case the gravitational and flavor eigenstates do not coincide and are related to each other by a unitary mixing matrix .",
    "however , as it is confirmed by the data of more than two decades of neutrino oscillation experiments , neutrinos are massive with at least two different nonzero masses for the three mass eigenstates . global analysis of oscillation data strongly verified that these mass differences are responsible for the observed oscillation phenomena and vep ( if exists ) can contribute only sub - dominantly . within this framework of massive neutrinos ,",
    "three sets of eigenstates can be defined : mass eigenstates ( which are defined by the diagonalization of charged lepton mass matrix ) , gravitational eigenstates ( which diagonalizes the coupling matrix of neutrinos to gravitational field , the diagonalizing matrix is not proportional to unit matrix in the presence of vep ) and flavor eigenstates ( which enter the charged current interaction ) . in general",
    "these three sets of eigenstates are not equal and so choosing one of them to write the schrdinger - like equation of evolution , demands to introduce two @xmath13 mixing matrix where one of them is almost the conventional pmns matrix and the other parametrize the vep ( see  @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the number of vep parameters is equal to the number of parameters required to parametrize the @xmath14 unitary matrix which is five , including the possible phases .",
    "however , since probing this multi - dimensional parameter space is cumbersome , we adopt a different approach which reduces the number of vep parameters to two .",
    "the approach we adopt in this paper ( which was introduced first in  @xcite ) is based on the assumption that the weak equivalence principle is violated via the dependence of newton s constant on the mass of the neutrino state ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath15 , where @xmath2 depends on the mass @xmath16 ( so , @xmath17 means restoration of equivalence principle ) .",
    "so , in our approach , vep is induced by the non - universality of gravitational coupling among the neutrino states , which is effectively taken into account by modifying the metric in the weak field approximation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that since currently strong limits exist on vep and no self - consistent quantum theory of gravity is envisaged , adopting this minimalistic and phenomenological approach is quite justifiable and robust .    in the weak field approximation , the space - time metric can be expressed as @xmath18 where the minkowski metric @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is the newtonian gravitational potential and the constant @xmath8 is implicit .",
    "as we mentioned , vep will be accommodated by introducing the multiplicative species - dependent factor @xmath2 such that @xmath22 . incorporating this metric in the klein - gordon equation ( and thus neglecting the spin - flip effects ) , we obtain the following relation for the hamiltonian eigenvalues  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the neutrino momentum . the usual relativistic dispersion relation @xmath25 is recovered for @xmath26 .",
    "changing to the flavor basis , the schrdinger - like equation of neutrino evolution takes the following form : @xmath27_{\\alpha\\beta}\\nu_\\beta~ , \\label{sch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the pmns mixing matrix ( @xmath29 s are rotation matrices with angle @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and the mass matrix @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . in this equation @xmath34",

    "the dominant contribution to @xmath21 is from the great attractor with the value @xmath43 ; though ambiguities exist on this value and also on other possible sources .",
    "however , since the vep effect appears just as the multiplication of @xmath21 and @xmath44 , these ambiguities can be avoided by reporting the limits on @xmath45 instead of @xmath44 .",
    "also , dominant contribution from large scale distant sources means that we can safely ignore the position dependence of @xmath46 over the propagation path of atmospheric neutrinos and assume that the potential is constant . in eq .",
    "( [ deltag ] ) the @xmath47 signs take into account the different possible hierarchies for vep parameters @xmath2 ; such that the plus sign means the hierarchy of vep parameters is the same as the one exhibited by the masses , while the minus sign represents the case where the hierarchies do not match . since there is no reason",

    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) , vep effectively modifies the standard neutrino oscillation picture by adding the term @xmath37 to the mass - squared matrix of neutrinos .",
    "thus , basically the vep in neutrino oscillation is equivalent to replacing the standard mass - squared differences @xmath63 by @xmath64 substituting this effective mass - squared difference in the evolution equation in eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dm2eff ] ) which induces the standard oscillation is inversely proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "it is well - known that the oscillation induced by this term diminishes in the high energy range ( @xmath66  gev ) , which is our interest in this paper : the @xmath67-mixing is suppressed in high energy due to the earth s matter effect , while the @xmath68 oscillation length @xmath69 becomes larger than the diameter of earth @xmath70  km and so @xmath71 oscillation will be suppressed . however , the second term in eq .",

    "thus , all the discussions of section  [ sub : caseii ] applies here , including the resonance and @xmath129 conversion at high energies , with the exception that the set of minima and maxima below the resonance is absent here , mainly since the minima and maxima of * case _ i _ * and * case _ ii _ * interfere and cancel each other .",
    "this absence of oscillatory behavior below the resonance energy , which means less deviation from standard oscillation , leads to weaker limit on vep parameters when @xmath228 , as we show in section  [ analysis ] .      in the previous subsections we discussed analytically the main features induced by vep on atmospheric neutrino oscillation in the high energy range .",
    "also we showed the numerical calculation of @xmath79 survival probability for up - going neutrinos at icecube ; _ i.e. _ , neutrinos which pass the diameter of earth and so their incoming direction have @xmath146 . in this section",
    "we present the oscillograms of @xmath79 survival probability which illustrates , among the others , also the zenith dependence of probability .",
    "[ fig : pmumu_vep+ ] shows the oscillograms of the @xmath79 survival probability .",

    "[ fig : casei ] we show the @xmath234 oscillation probability for the * case _ i _ * in section  [ sub : casei ] with @xmath155 .",
    "the resonance energy @xmath235  tev is out of the depicted energy range in panel  [ fig : casei ] and so in all the energy range of this panel @xmath236 . as we discussed in section  [ sub : casei ] , below the resonance energy , oscillation is almost vacuum oscillation dictated by the vep effective mass difference , @xmath237 and the amplitude @xmath238 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vepemin ] ) the energy of first vep - induced minimum in @xmath239 at @xmath146 is @xmath240  tev , which is in agreement with panel  [ fig : casei ] . also , from eq .",

    "in this section we confront the atmospheric neutrino data collected by icecube with the expectation in the presence of vep .",
    "generally icecube can identify two types of events : muon - tracks and cascades .",
    "muon - tracks originate from the charged current interaction of @xmath79 and @xmath245 which produce respectively @xmath246 and @xmath247 that their propagation inside the ice emits cherenkov radiation collectable by photomultipliers implemented in ice and @xmath248 and the subsequent leptonic decay of tau particles to muons .",
    "this contribution is quite small in the high energy range that we are considering in this paper . ] .",
    "cascade events originate from the other interactions including the neutral current interaction of all the neutrino flavors and charged current interaction of @xmath67 , @xmath249 and their antineutrinos .",
    "each of these two types of events have advantages and disadvantages : for muon - tracks the benefits are great resolution in reconstruction of the direction of incoming neutrinos and high statistics due to long muon range in ice and rock ; while the drawback is the moderate resolution in energy reconstruction .",
    "one the other hand , for cascades the energy reconstruction is good while the direction reconstruction of incoming neutrinos is poor .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the atmospheric neutrino data sets ic-40  @xcite and ic-79  @xcite containing muon - track events collected by respectively 40 and 79 strings out of the final 86 strings of completed icecube .",
    "the energy range of ic-40 ad ic-79 data set are respectively 100  gev-400  tev and 100  gev-10  tev .",
    "to calculate the expected distribution of events in the presence of vep , we compute numerically the oscillation probabilities by scanning the whole parameter space of @xmath3 . in the numerical computation of probabilities",
    "we fix the mixing parameters to their best - fit values from  @xcite and for the density of earth we use the prem model  @xcite .    also we calculate the expected sensitivity of icecube to vep parameters from cascade events .",
    "icecube already observed atmospheric neutrino induced cascade events with ic-40  @xcite and deepcore  @xcite which the latter provided the first measurement of atmospheric @xmath67 flux . in section  [ cascades ]",
    "we calculate the the sensitivity of cascade events to vep parameters assuming the full icecube detector .",
    "the ic-40 and ic-79 data sets are published by icecube collaboration in 10 bins of @xmath150 ( from @xmath250 to @xmath251 with bin width @xmath252 ) and integrated over energy . to analyze these data",
    "we calculate the expected number of events in bins of zenith angle and energy , where for the energy bins we takes widths @xmath253 and @xmath254 , respectively for ic-40 and ic-79 configurations .",
    "however , at the end we confront the total number of events in zenith bins ( integrated over the neutrino energy ) with data .",

    ", we perform a simple @xmath265 analysis defined in the following way @xmath266^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}_{i,{\\rm stat } } + \\sigma^{2}_{i,{\\rm sys } } } \\right ) + \\dfrac{(1-\\alpha)^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}_{\\alpha}}+\\dfrac{\\beta^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}_{\\beta}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath267 is the statistical error , @xmath268 and @xmath269 are the parameters that take into account respectively the correlated normalization and zenith dependence uncertainties of the atmospheric neutrino flux with the uncertainties @xmath270 and @xmath271  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath272 is the uncorrelated systematic error which for ic-40 and ic-79 we assume @xmath273 and @xmath274 respectively values .",
    "however , the obtained bounds are quite smooth with respect to changes in the value of @xmath275 . ] .",
    "the index @xmath276 runs over zenith bins and @xmath277 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tracks ] ) by summing over @xmath256 .",
    "after marginalizing with respect to @xmath268 and @xmath269 pull parameters , upper limit on vep parameters @xmath3 can be obtained .    fig .",
    "[ fig : limit ] shows the the obtained limit ( at 90% c.l . ) on vep parameters from analyzing the ic-40 and ic-79 data . in this figure",
    "the green solid and red dashed curves are for ic-40 and ic-79 data , respectively .",
    "clearly the weakening of bound at @xmath278 is visible , which we discussed in section  [ sub : caseiii ] .",
    "the 1-dim limits on vep parameters are ( at 90% c.l . )",
    "@xmath279 comparing these limits with the current bounds in table  [ ultima ] shows that the limit on @xmath60 is stronger by @xmath5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the limit on @xmath61 from icecube data is stronger than the current bound by @xmath7 order of magnitudes .",
    "let us discuss the sensitivity of atmospheric induced cascade events to vep parameters .",
    "as we mentioned , the cascade events originate from neutral current interaction of all neutrino flavors and charged current interaction of electron and tau neutrinos .",
    "thus , any conversion of @xmath79 ( @xmath245 ) to @xmath67 ( @xmath280 ) or @xmath249 ( @xmath248 ) would lead to a distortion in the zenith and energy distributions of cascade events .",
    "especially , as we discussed in section  [ sec : vep - energy ] , vep lead to @xmath129 conversion and so affect the cascade distributions .",
    "although for cascade events the zenith resolution is poor , but the better energy resolution with respect to muon - track events makes the cascade analysis plausible .",
    "we calculate the sensitivity of icecube ( including the deepcore part  @xcite which has higher efficiency in cascade detection ) to vep parameters .",
    "the number of cascade events can be calculated similar to section  [ muon - tracks analysis ] by taking into account the appropriate effective volume of icecube for cascade detection .",
    "for the details of the calculation of cascade number of events see  @xcite . again by performing an @xmath265 analysis ( confronting energy distribution instead of zenith distribution for muon - tracks ) we estimated the sensitivity of cascades to vep parameters .",
    "we have found a negligible increase in @xmath265 value compared to the standard oscillation scenario for cascades .",
    "thus , the limit on vep parameters from cascades are weaker than the limits from muon - tracks and the strongest limit on vep parameter are the ones reported in section  [ muon - tracks analysis ] .",
    "one of the essential pillars in the theory of gravitation , both classical and relativistic , is the equivalence principle which has been tested in a variety of experiments .",
    "violation of equivalence principle has far - reaching consequences in the neutrino sector , basically introducing novel oscillation pattern which can be measured at neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "thus , neutrino phenomenology provides a unique tool to probe the possible violation of equivalence principle .",
    "the strength of vep effect on neutrino oscillation depends on the neutrino energy : the vep effectively introduce mass - squared differences proportional to @xmath281 and so the oscillation phase will be proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "thus , clearly , the recent collected data of high energy ( @xmath149  gev ) atmospheric neutrinos by icecube experiment can discover / constrain vep unprecedentedly .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of vep on the oscillation of high energy atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "in the high energy range the conventional standard oscillation induced by @xmath63 is absent and the survival probability of each neutrino flavor is @xmath7 .",
    "however , vep can drastically change this pattern : the effective energy - dependent mass - squared differences induced by vep can lead to resonance flavor conversions and also oscillatory behavior in high energy with new maxima and minima in flavor oscillation probabilities . for the phenomenological model of vep we considered in this paper , with the two vep parameters @xmath282 and @xmath42 , we studied in detail the oscillation pattern and provided the analytical descriptions of oscillation probabilities .",
    "we justified the numerical calculation of oscillation probabilities ( especially @xmath239 which plays the main role in icecube analysis ) with the obtained analytical expressions and showed that the analytical approximation explains the oscillation pattern with impressive accuracy .",
    "furthermore , we confronted the expected zenith distribution of muon - track events in the presence of vep with the collected data by icecube experiments with two different configurations , namely ic-40 and ic-79 data sets . to analyze these data we performed a simple @xmath265 analysis taking into account the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the oscillation probabilities have been calculated numerically by scanning the parameter space of vep parameters in the full three flavors framework . from these analyses we obtained the following bounds on the vep parameters at 90% c.l .",
    ": @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "the obtained limit on @xmath60 is @xmath5 orders of magnitude stronger than the current limit ; also we improved the existing bound on @xmath61 by @xmath7 order of magnitude .",
    "finally we investigated the future sensitivity of icecube to vep parameters .",
    "we have presented the sensitivity region in vep parameter space assuming three times of ic-79 data set ; which improves mildly the obtained limits .",
    "also , we have studied the effect of vep on cascade events in icecube , motivated by the fact that vep induces @xmath129 conversion that can distort the energy distribution of cascade events . however , due to lower statistics and higher uncertainties for cascade detection , the sensitivity of icecube to vep parameters in cascade channel is less than the sensitivity in muon - track channel .    at the end",
    "we would like to emphasize that the limits obtained in this paper can be translated to limits on the parameters of theories ( either effective theories or extensions of standard model ) which predict / accommodate vep to some level .",
    "as an example in this line we can mention the standard model extension ( sme ) theories which consist of extending the standard model action by including all the possible terms that violate the lorentz invariance  @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of sme is the violation of equivalence principle such that test of vep provide a tool for searches of lorentz symmetry violation .",
    "further speculations regarding these connections and possibilities to probe fundamental theories by vep tests in neutrino sector  @xcite will be pursued in a later work .",
