    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in understanding the scaling behavior in submonolayer island nucleation and growth.@xcite one reason for this is that the submonolayer growth regime plays an important role in determining the later stages of thin - film growth.@xcite of particular interest is the dependence of the total island - density @xmath0 and island - size distribution @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the density of islands of size @xmath3 at coverage @xmath4 and @xmath3 is the number of monomers in an island ) on deposition parameters such as the deposition flux @xmath36 and growth temperature @xmath37 .",
    "one concept that has proven especially useful in studies of submonolayer epitaxial growth is that of a critical island size,@xcite corresponding to one less than the size of the smallest  stable \" cluster . for example , if we assume that only monomers can diffuse , then in the case of submonolayer growth of 2d islands on a solid 2d substrate , standard nucleation theory@xcite predicts that the peak island density @xmath38 and the monomer density @xmath39 at fixed coverage satisfy , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the monomer hopping rate , @xmath42 is the critical island size , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we note that in the case of irreversible island growth ( @xmath45 ) this implies that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that in the absence of cluster - diffusion and in the pre - coalescence regime the island - size distribution ( isd ) satisfies the scaling form , @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath27 is the average island size , and the scaling function @xmath49 depends on the critical island size.@xcite    however , in some cases ( such as in epitaxial growth on metal(111 ) surfaces ) it is also possible for significant _ small _ cluster diffusion to occur.@xcite in addition , several mechanisms for the diffusion of _ large _ clusters on solid surfaces have also been proposed .",
    "@xcite in each case , scaling arguments predict that the cluster diffusion coefficient @xmath5 decays as a power - law with island - size @xmath3 ( where @xmath3 is the number of particles in a cluster ) , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , three different limiting cases have been considered@xcite - cluster diffusion due to uncorrelated evaporation - condensation ( @xmath7 ) , cluster diffusion due to correlated evaporation / condensation ( @xmath51 ) , and cluster diffusion due to periphery diffusion ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we note that the case @xmath7 also corresponds to the brownian ( stokes - einstein ) diffusion of compact 2d clusters in two - dimensions .    in order to understand",
    "the effects of island diffusion on the submonolayer scaling behavior a number of simulations have previously been carried out .",
    "for example , jensen et al@xcite have studied the effects of island - diffusion with @xmath51 on the percolation coverage for the case of irreversible growth without relaxation , corresponding to islands with fractal dimension @xmath52 .",
    "more recently , mulheran and robbie@xcite have used a similar model to study the dependence of the exponent @xmath13 on the cluster - diffusion exponent @xmath15 for values of @xmath15 ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "they found that for small values of @xmath15 the value of the exponent ( @xmath55 ) is significantly larger than the value ( @xmath56 ) expected in the absence of cluster diffusion , although it decreases with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "however , the scaling of the isd was not studied.@xcite    motivated in part by these simulations , krapivsky et al@xcite have carried out an analysis of the scaling behavior for the case of point - islands , based on the corresponding mean - field smoluchowski equations.@xcite their analysis suggests that due to the large amount of diffusion and coalescence in this case , for @xmath19 the total island density saturates ( corresponding to  steady - state \" behavior ) while the isd exhibits power - law behavior of the form , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and the prefactor does not depend on coverage",
    ". has also been derived by cueille and sire@xcite and camacho.@xcite ] this power - law dependence for the isd is predicted to hold up to a critical island - size @xmath22 , where @xmath28 and @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath32 continuous island evolution is predicted , e.g. the total island density does not saturate , and as a result no simple power - law behavior is predicted for the isd .",
    "their analysis also indicates that for all values of @xmath15 , one has @xmath60 with logarithmic corrections .",
    "however , it should be noted that the point - island approximation is typically only valid at extremely low coverages .    here",
    "we present the results of kinetic monte carlo simulations of irreversible island growth with cluster diffusion for the case of compact islands with fractal dimension @xmath61 . among the primary motivations for this work",
    "are recent experiments@xcite on the growth of ( compact ) colloidal nanoparticle islands at a liquid - air interface in which significant cluster diffusion has been observed .",
    "accordingly , in contrast to much of the previous work@xcite our model is an off - lattice model .",
    "however , our main goal here is not to explain these experiments but rather to obtain results which may be used as a reference for future work . as already noted ,",
    "if cluster diffusion is due to 2d brownian motion ( as might be expected at a fluid - interface ) then the value of the exponent @xmath15 ( @xmath7 ) is the same as that expected for uncorrelated evaporation - condensation .",
    "however , we also present results for @xmath51 ( corresponding to cluster - diffusion due to correlated evaporation - condensation ) , @xmath9 ( corresponding to cluster - diffusion due to periphery diffusion ) as well as for higher values of @xmath15 ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our model in detail along with the parameters used in our simulations , while in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the methods we have used to enhance the simulation efficiency . in sec .",
    "iv we derive a generalized scaling form for the isd which is appropriate for the case of a power - law isd with @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "we then present our results for the scaling of the island - size distribution and island and monomer densities as a function of @xmath65 , coverage , and @xmath15 in sec .",
    "v. finally , in sec .",
    "vi we discuss our results .",
    "for simplicity we have studied a model of irreversible aggregation in which all islands are assumed to be circular and rapid island relaxation ( perhaps due to periphery diffusion ) is assumed . in particular , in our model",
    "each island or cluster of size @xmath3 ( where @xmath3 is the number of monomers in a cluster ) is represented by a circle with area @xmath66 and diameter @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the monomer diameter .",
    "in addition , each cluster of size @xmath3 may diffuse with diffusion rate @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the monomer diffusion rate , @xmath41 is the monomer  hopping rate \" , and @xmath71 is the hopping length .",
    "similarly , we may write @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the hopping rate for a cluster of size @xmath3 .    in order to take into account deposition ,",
    "monomers are also randomly deposited onto the substrate with rate @xmath74 per unit time per unit area . since instantaneous coalesce and relaxation is assumed , whenever two clusters touch or overlap , a new island is formed whose area is equal to the sum of the areas of the original clusters , and whose center corresponds to the center - of - mass of both islands .",
    "we note that in some cases a coalescence event may lead to overlap of the resulting cluster with additional clusters . in this case",
    ", coalescence is allowed to proceed until there are no more overlaps .",
    "in addition , if a monomer lands on an existing cluster , then that monomer is automatically ` absorbed ' by the cluster .",
    "thus , at each step of our simulation either a monomer is deposited ( followed by a check for overlap with any clusters ) or a cluster is selected for diffusion . if a cluster is selected for diffusion , then the center of the cluster is displaced by a distance @xmath71 in a randomly selected direction . for computational efficiency , and also because it is the smallest length - scale in the problem , in most of the results presented here we have assumed @xmath75 .",
    "however , we have also carried out some simulations with smaller values ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) in order to approach the continuum limit . as discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "vi , our results indicate that the dependence of the island and monomer densities on the hopping distance @xmath71 is relatively weak .",
    "we note that besides the exponent @xmath15 describing the dependence of the cluster diffusion rate on cluster - size , the other key parameter in our simulations is the ratio @xmath78 of the monomer hopping rate to the monomer deposition rate ( scaled by the ratio of the hopping length to the monomer diameter ) e.g. , @xmath79 we note that this definition implies that the dimensionless ratio @xmath80 of the monomer diffusion coefficient @xmath81 to the deposition flux satisfies , @xmath82    our simulations were carried out assuming a 2d square substrate of size @xmath83 ( in units of the monomer diameter @xmath68 ) and periodic boundary conditions . in order to avoid finite - size effects ,",
    "the value of @xmath83 used ( @xmath84 ) was relatively large , while our results were averaged over @xmath85 runs in order to obtain good statistics . in order to determine the asymptotic dependence of the island density on coverage and",
    "@xmath78 our simulations were carried out using values of @xmath86 ranging from @xmath87 up to a maximum coverage of @xmath88 monolayers ( ml ) . in order to study the dependence on @xmath15",
    ", simulations were carried out for @xmath7 ( corresponding to brownian diffusion or uncorrelated evaporation - condensation ) , @xmath51 ( corresponding to correlated evaporation - condensation ) , and @xmath89 ( corresponding to periphery diffusion ) as well as for higher values ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) as well as the case @xmath12 corresponding to only monomer diffusion .    in order to obtain a quantitative understanding of the submonolayer growth behavior , we have measured a variety of quantities including the monomer density @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the number of monomers in the system ) as a function of coverage @xmath4 , and the total island density @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 is the total number of islands including monomers in the system ) .",
    "in addition , we have also measured the island - size distribution @xmath1 where @xmath94 corresponds to the density of islands of size @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the factors of @xmath95 in the definitions above take into account the fact that the area of a monomer is @xmath96 , and as a result the densities defined above all correspond to area fractions .",
    "similarly , the coverage @xmath97 corresponds to the fraction of the total area covered by islands ( including monomers ) .",
    "while a simple monte carlo approach can be used@xcite to simulate the processes of monomer deposition and cluster diffusion such a method can be very inefficient for large values of @xmath78 and small values of @xmath15 , since the large range of island - sizes and diffusion rates can lead to a low acceptance ratio . accordingly , here we use a kinetic monte carlo approach .",
    "in particular , if we set the deposition rate @xmath36 per unit area @xmath98 equal to @xmath99 , then the total deposition rate in the system is @xmath100 while the hopping rate for a cluster of size @xmath3 is given by @xmath101 . as a result",
    ", the total diffusion rate for all clusters is given by @xmath102 ( where @xmath103 is the number of clusters of size @xmath3 ) while the total rate of deposition onto the substrate is @xmath100 .",
    "the probability @xmath104 of depositing a monomer is then given by , @xmath105 while the probability of cluster diffusion is @xmath106 .",
    "if cluster diffusion is selected , then a binary tree@xcite ( whose bottom leaves correspond to the total hopping rate @xmath107 for each size @xmath3 ) may be used to efficiently select with the correct probability which cluster will move as well as to efficiently update @xmath108 . however , for large @xmath78 and small @xmath15 the maximum cluster - size can be larger than @xmath109 and as a result the computational overhead associated with the binary tree can still be significant .",
    "accordingly , we have implemented a variation@xcite of the binary tree approach in which a range of cluster - sizes are clustered together into a single ` leaf ' or bin .",
    "in particular , to minimize the size of the binary tree , starting with island - size @xmath110 we have used variable bin - sizes such that each bin contains several different cluster sizes ranging from a starting value @xmath42 to a value approximately equal to @xmath111 .",
    "using this scheme allows us to use a binary tree with a maximum of @xmath112 leaves and a rejection probability of only @xmath113 . to further decrease the computational overhead , our binary tree grows dynamically from @xmath114 leaves to as many as needed .    by properly selecting the rates in the binary tree and the corresponding acceptance probabilities",
    ", one can ensure that each diffusion event is selected with the proper rate .",
    "in particular , if we define the rate of bin @xmath42 as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the maximum cluster - diffusion rate in bin @xmath117 ( corresponding to the smallest cluster - size in the bin ) and @xmath118 is the number of islands in the bin , then the sum over all leaves may be written , @xmath119 the probability of attempting a diffusion event is then given by , @xmath120 while the probability of selecting bin @xmath42 is given by @xmath121 .",
    "once a bin is selected using the binary tree , a specific cluster is then selected randomly from the list of all the clusters in that bin .",
    "this implies that a cluster of size @xmath3 will be selected with probability @xmath122 .",
    "thus , by assuming an acceptance probability for the selected cluster - diffusion event given by @xmath123 each diffusion event will be selected with the proper rate .    since",
    "our simulations are carried out off - lattice , one of the most time - consuming processes is the search for overlaps every time a cluster is moved . while the simplest way to carry out such a search is to check for overlaps with all other islands in the system , the search time scales as @xmath100 , and as a result it becomes very time - consuming for large systems .",
    "accordingly , we have used a neighbor look - up table@xcite which contains a list of all other islands within a buffer - distance of each island .",
    "the search for overlaps is then carried out only among the neighbors on this list rather than over all the islands in the system .",
    "the neighbor list is updated whenever the total displacement of any island since the last update is larger than half the buffer - distance .    to speed - up the updates of the neighbor table ,",
    "we have also used a `` grid '' method@xcite in which our system is divided into an @xmath124 by @xmath124 grid of boxes of size @xmath125 and each cluster can be rapidly assigned to a given box . using this method the search for neighbors only includes clusters within an island s box as well as the @xmath126 adjacent boxes . as a result , the table update time is reduced to @xmath127 instead of @xmath100 . to further optimize the speed of our simulations , the grid size is varied as the average island - size increases .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "i , in both simulations and experiments on submonolayer epitaxial growth , the island - size distribution ( isd ) is typically assumed to satisfy the scaling form given in eq .",
    "[ isdscal ] .",
    "however , this scaling form has been derived@xcite on the assumption that there is only one characteristic size - scale @xmath27 corresponding to the average island - size , and that the isd does not diverge for small @xmath128 . however , in our simulations of monomer deposition and cluster diffusion and aggregation with @xmath19 , we find that the isd exhibits a well - defined power - law behavior for small @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , the existence of a shoulder in the isd for large @xmath129 implies the existence of a second characteristic length - scale which scales as @xmath28 .",
    "we note that this corresponds to an island size - scale such that steady - state behavior breaks down , due to the existence of mass - conservation and a finite diffusion length .    in general one would expect this to lead to a more complicated two - variable scaling of the form @xmath130",
    ". however , if the power - law behavior for small @xmath128 is well - defined ( and @xmath64 ) then it is possible to derive a generalized scaling form involving only one variable . in particular",
