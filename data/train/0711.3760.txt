    "in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) we have three families of fermions , leptons and quarks , the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the gluon @xmath4 as the strong interaction gauge boson and one scalar higgs doublet field @xcite . for an introduction to the physics of the sm",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "our notations and kinematics conventions follow this reference .",
    "the sm gives , however , no explanation why there should be a replication of families in nature .",
    "also , the fermion masses , arising from the yukawa interactions of the fermions with the higgs field , remain arbitrary .    in this paper",
    "we present some considerations based on a two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) .",
    "we show that a certain type of @xmath0  symmetry , which is possible for a thdm forbids a non - zero yukawa coupling to _",
    "one _ fermion family only . however , an invariant coupling to _ two _ fermion families can be constructed .",
    "moreover , this new type of @xmath0  symmetry is automatically spontaneously broken by the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "as we shall show , this also leads to interesting results for the masses in the two fermion families .",
    "in essence we find that in this type of theories absence of large flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) can only be achieved if the corresponding fermions in the two families have equal masses or if one family is massive , one massless .",
    "various aspects of two - higgs - doublet models have been investigated in the literature ; see for instance @xcite and references therein . in our group we have made a systematic study of the stability and symmetry breaking in the most general thdm @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have made a systematic investigation of all possible types of generalised @xmath0  transformations for the two higgs doublets .",
    "we have also given the criteria for @xmath0  invariance of the two - higgs - doublet potential and for spontaneous @xmath0  violation .",
    "in particular , we classified the generalised @xmath0  transformations as type ( i ) and type ( ii ) . the structure of the higgs sector of theories with type ( i ) @xmath0  invariance was discussed . in the present work we continue the investigation of thdms with type ( i ) @xmath0   invariance in view of the possibilities for invariant fermion ",
    "higgs - boson couplings in this framework .",
    "indeed , the paper @xcite and the present paper are companion papers .",
    "therefore sections and equations of @xcite will be quoted as section i.1 etc . and ( i.1 ) ,",
    "( i.2 ) etc . respectively .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec - model ]",
    "we recall the main results of @xcite concerning thdms with generalised @xmath0  invariance of type  ( i ) . in section  [ sec - higgses ]",
    "we discuss the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and the physical higgs mass spectrum of our models . in section  [ sec - fermions ]",
    "we introduce the fermion families and consider their coupling to the higgs fields . in section  [ sec - discussion ]",
    "we collect our results and discuss their physical consequences .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "detailed derivations of various results are presented in the appendices .",
    "we consider models with the particle content as in the sm but with @xmath6 fermion families @xmath7 and with two higgs doublet fields instead of one .",
    "the two higgs fields are denoted by @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the gauge group of our models is assumed to be the usual one , @xmath10 . in the following",
    "the gauge group @xmath11  of strong interactions will play no role .",
    "we shall be concerned with the gauge groups of weak isospin , @xmath12 , and weak hypercharge @xmath13 .",
    "both higgs doublets in are assigned weak hypercharge @xmath14 .",
    "the most general gauge - invariant lagrange density can then be written as @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the standard gauge kinetic lagrange density for fermions and gauge bosons ; see for instance  @xcite .",
    "the higgs - boson lagrangian is @xmath17 with @xmath18 the higgs - boson potential .",
    "finally , the yukawa term , denoted by @xmath19 , contains the higgs - boson - fermion couplings which will be the main focus of study in this paper .",
    "let us , however , first recall the main result from  @xcite and  @xcite concerning the higgs potential @xmath20 and @xmath0  transformations in the higgs sector .",
    "we use the framework of gauge - invariant functions . for this",
    "we introduce the @xmath21 matrix of the higgs fields ( see ( a.2 ) of @xcite and ( i.8 ) ) , @xmath22 similarly , the scalar products of two higgs fields , @xmath23 @xmath24 are grouped into a @xmath25 hermitian matrix @xmath26 here we have expanded @xmath27 in terms of the unit matrix @xmath28 and the pauli matrices @xmath29 , thus defining the gauge - invariant functions @xmath30 these form a real four - vector parametrising the gauge orbits of the higgs fields . as we see immediately from @xmath27 is a positive semidefinite @xmath21 matrix .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 must be on or inside the forward light cone : @xmath32 where @xmath33 the most general @xmath34-invariant potential can now be written as @xmath35 here the potential parameters are a real four - vector and a real symmetric @xmath36 matrix : @xmath37    under a basis change of the higgs doublets @xmath38 with @xmath39 the functions @xmath40 , @xmath41 transform as @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a proper rotation matrix @xmath44 obtained from @xmath45 the potential stays the same under such a basis change if we transform the parameters as follows @xmath46 this can for instance be used to diagonalise the real symmetric matrix @xmath47 .",
    "the precise conditions for the potential to be stable and to lead to the ewsb observed in nature were spelled out in @xcite .",
    "a thorough investigation of the possibilities for @xmath0  invariance and spontaneous @xmath0  violation for the higgs lagrangian with the potential was done in @xcite .",
    "there , we gave a classification of possible generalised @xmath0  transformations of the lagrangian in type ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "this classification is geometrically motivated : the @xmath48  transformation of type  ( i ) corresponds to the point reflection at the origin in @xmath49-space , whereas a type  ( ii ) @xmath50  transformation corresponds to a reflection on a plane in @xmath49-space .",
    "note that it is not possible to convert type  ( i ) and type  ( ii ) transformations into each other by a change of basis .    in terms of the fields ,",
    "the type  ( i ) generalised @xmath0  transformation is denoted by @xmath48  and defined by ( see ( i.54 ) ) @xmath51 \\label{2.13a } & & \\varphi_i(x ) & \\rightarrow \\epsilon_{ij } \\varphi_j^\\ast(x')\\,,\\notag\\\\ & & \\phi(x )       & \\rightarrow \\epsilon \\phi^\\ast(x')\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the matrix of @xmath54 four - potentials with @xmath55 the pauli matrices .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 is the hypercharge four - potential and @xmath57 with we find for the gauge - invariant functions @xmath58 that is , the @xmath48  transformation corresponds to the point reflection at the origin in @xmath49-space in addition to the change of argument @xmath59 .",
    "twofold application of the @xmath48  transformation gives the original higgs fields with a minus sign .",
    "this minus sign corresponds to a hypercharge transformation , and thus drops out when considering the twofold @xmath48  transformation   of the gauge - invariant functions .",
    "note that the @xmath48  transformation of the fields given by  ( [ 2.13a ] ) has the _ same _ form in _ any _ higgs basis , up to gauge transformations .",
    "see section i.3 and appendix i.b .",
    "the type ( ii ) generalised @xmath0  transformations are those which reduce to the standard @xmath0  transformation in a suitable basis for the higgs doublets ( see section i.3.2 ) .",
    "that is , after a suitable basis change we have @xmath60 whereas the transformation of the gauge potentials stays as in . for the original higgs basis we",
    "have then : @xmath61 here , the argument change and complex conjugation of the higgs fields @xmath62 is supplemented by a basis change . for the gauge - invariant functions these type ( ii ) @xmath50  transformations",
    "correspond to reflections on a plane in @xmath49-space .",
    "these reflections are orthogonally equivalent to @xmath63 , the reflection on the 13 plane .",
    "indeed , let us define the reflections on the coordinate planes as @xmath64 then we find from @xmath65 where we have with @xmath43 from @xmath66 note that a twofold @xmath67  transformation reproduces the original higgs fields without an additional phase .",
    "invariance of the potential under a generalised @xmath0  transformation was found in section i.3 to require for the parameters @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the improper rotation matrix in @xmath49-space corresponding to the generalised @xmath0  symmetry .",
    "a generalised @xmath50  symmetry of type  ( i ) corresponds to @xmath70 whereas type ( ii ) corresponds to @xmath71 , .",
    "now we can write down the most general potential having @xmath48  invariance ; see theorem i.2 .",
    "we must have @xmath72 and @xmath73 in order to satisfy .",
    "thus , @xmath74 in the following we shall always suppose that by a basis change as in and we have diagonalised @xmath75 and ordered the eigenvalues as follows : @xmath76    in theorem i.5 we found that the potential leads to a stable theory with the correct ewsb and no zero mass charged higgs bosons if and only if @xmath77 in the following we shall always suppose these conditions to hold .",
    "the vacuum solution for the higgs fields , denoted by @xmath78 is obtained from the global minimum of @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 are @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 in appendix i.b we have already discussed this vacuum solution .",
    "we get ( see ( i.b.41 ) ) @xmath84    in section 7 of @xcite a general discussion of the structure of the higgs sector in thdms after ewsb was given .",
    "the basis choice in this reference coincides with our present choice .",
    "we can , therefore , set for the higgs field vacuum expectation values @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the standard higgs vacuum expectation value ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we use the unitary gauge and introduce the shifted , that is , the physical higgs fields as in ( 129 )  ff of @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath87 here @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the three real fields corresponding to the physical neutral higgs particles and @xmath91 is the complex field corresponding to the physical charged higgs particle .",
    "we set @xmath92 from the results of section 7 of @xcite and appendix i.b we can now immediately read off a number of relations .",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath93 corresponding to the global minimum of the potential @xmath20 is @xmath94 inserting in we get for the vacuum four - vector @xmath95 ( see ( 134 ) of @xcite ) @xmath96 comparison with gives @xmath97{\\frac{-\\xi_0}{\\eta_{00}+\\mu_3}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the mass squared of the charged higgs particles is , according to ( 145 ) of @xcite , @xmath98 the mass matrix squared of the neutral higgs particles is obtained from ( 144 ) of @xcite as follows : @xmath99 with the ordering @xmath100 for the fields .",
    "we see that @xmath101 is already diagonal with our choice of basis .",
    "thus we have @xmath102 in the following we shall require that none of the neutral physical higgs particles is massless and that there is no mass degeneracy between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this implies from the condition @xmath105 which is slightly stricter than .",
    "our higgs potential has five parameters @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "we can now express these in terms of the five physical quantities @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "this gives @xmath116 for positive squared masses and @xmath117 the conditions and are always satisfied .",
    "let us next discuss the @xmath0  symmetries of our model and the @xmath0   transformation properties of the vacuum expectation values and of the physical fields .",
    "the higgs lagrangian with the potential for which we require to hold , allows for exactly four generalised @xmath0   transformations , @xmath48 , @xmath118 , @xmath119  and @xmath120 as defined below . in all cases the gauge potentials",
    "are transformed according to .",
    "but the transformation of the higgs fields and of the gauge - invariant functions @xmath40",
    ", @xmath41 is different .        the type ( ii ) transformation @xmath119  is the standard cp transformation , @xmath125 , for the higgs fields , where @xmath126 here we get @xmath127 with @xmath63 the matrix of the reflection on the 13 plane ; see .",
    "now we summarise the four different @xmath50  transformations for the higgs fields as @xmath131 the matrices @xmath132 for the various @xmath50  transformations are listed in tab .  [ tab - cphiggs ] ; see , , and .",
    "we note that we could supplement an additional global phase factor on the right - hand side of .",
    "however , such a global phase factor in the higgs @xmath0  transformation drops out in the higgs potential , and for the yukawa terms it may always be absorbed by proper redefinitions of the fermion fields , as will be explained in the next section .",
    "therefore we may without loss of generality set this global phase factor to @xmath133 .",
    "clearly , imposing the invariances @xmath48  to @xmath120  with the transformations specified in tab .",
    "[ tab-5 ] is equivalent to imposing @xmath134  plus the discrete invariances @xmath135 to @xmath136 as specified in tab .",
    "[ tab-6 ] .",
    "but in our opinion the latter procedure would be completely ad hoc",
    ". we could give no physical argument for considering just the specific transformations shown above for the higgs fields , the first , the second and the third fermion families .",
    "why would we group the second and third families together ?",
    "on the other hand , we hope to have shown in the main text of this paper that the principle of maximal @xmath0  invariance provides us with a clear physical argument to single out the form of the higgs potential  ( [ 2.20 ] ) and of the yukawa coupling term  ( [ 5.2 ] ) .",
