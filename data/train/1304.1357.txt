    "manipulation by atomic and molecular systems is an important branch of modern science with applications ranging from optimal laser driven population transfer in atomic systems out to laser assisted control of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "high interest is directed towards control of the landau - zener ( lz ) system  a two - state quantum system whose unitary evolution under the action of the control @xmath0 ( e.g. , shaped laser field ) is governed by the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the case @xmath5 with constant @xmath6 was studied by landau , zener , stckelberg , and majorana  @xcite .",
    "this system has been widely applied in physics , chemistry , and biochemistry , e.g. , for describing transfer of charge along with its energy  @xcite , photosynthesis  @xcite , atomic and molecular collisions , processes in plasma physics  @xcite , bose - einstein condensate  @xcite , experimental realizations of qubits , etc .",
    "@xcite .    controlled manipulation by a quantum system can be formulated as finding global maxima of a suitable objective @xmath7 associated to the system .",
    "for example , maximizing the probability of transition from the initial state @xmath8 to a target final state @xmath9 at a final time @xmath10 can be described by maximizing @xmath11 .",
    "a control which attains a local maximum of @xmath12 can be found either numerically using the model of the system or experimentally . in both circumstances ,",
    "the first step of a common procedure is to apply a trial pulse @xmath13 and obtain the outcome @xmath14 , either numerically or measuring it in the laboratory .",
    "the second step is to make various small modifications of @xmath13 and find @xmath15 which produces maximum increase in @xmath12",
    ". then @xmath15 is used as a new trial pulse and the procedure is repeated until no significant increase is produced or a maximum number of iterations is reached .    of crucial practical importance",
    "is to know whether @xmath7 has _ traps _ ,",
    "i.e. local maxima with the values less than the global maximum , as necessary to properly choose between local ( e.g. , gradient ) and global optimization methods  @xcite .",
    "traps can strongly influence on both theoretical and experimental quantum control studies  they determine the level of difficulty of controlling the system and can significantly slow down or even completely prevent finding globally optimal controls . whereas the analysis of traps in manipulation by quantum systems has attracted high attention  @xcite , no examples of trap - free quantum systems have been known .",
    "only partial theoretical results have been obtained stating the absence of traps at special regular controls .",
    "this finding does not at all exclude the absence of traps that makes the problem open since even a single trap may produce significant difficulties for the optimization if it has a large attracting domain  @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that the lz system is trap - free and hence , for example , the only extrema of @xmath16 for this system are global maxima and minima .",
    "this finding provides the first example of a trap - free quantum control system where unconstrained local manipulations are always sufficient to find best control pulses .",
    "sufficiently strong constraints on the controls may destroy this property and in the end we discuss possible limitations for the analysis due to decoherence , noise in the control pulses and limited tunability of the control strength and time scales in laboratory experiments .",
    "formally , a control field @xmath0 is a trap for the objective @xmath7 if it is a local maximum , i.e. , a maximum with the value less than the global maximum , @xmath17 ( in this work we consider as control goal maximizing the objective ; if the goal is to minimize the objective then traps are local minima ) .",
    "answering the question whether traps exist for a given control problem is crucial for determining proper algorithms and our abilities for finding optimal control fields . in the absence of traps , local search algorithms should generally be able to find globally optimal controls ( exceptions may occur if the initial control is chosen exactly at a saddle point , where the gradient of the objective is zero ) .",
    "if the objective has traps ( perhaps even a single trap with large attracting domain ) then local search procedures may converge to local maxima instead of attaining a desired globally optimal control and more sophisticated global search methods should be exploited for a successful optimization .",
    "traps are critical points , i.e. , the gradient @xmath18 at any trap .",
    "critical points for control objectives @xmath16 were studied in seminal works  @xcite , where the absence of traps was suggested .",
    "the suggestion was drawn from the proof that any function of the form @xmath19 $ ] ( @xmath20 is a positive matrix and @xmath21 is hermitian ) defined on the unitary group @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the system dimension , has as extrema only global maxima , global minima , and saddles and has no traps .",
    "( extrema of trace functions over unitary and orthogonal groups were studied in other contexts by j. von neumann  @xcite , r.  brockett  @xcite , s.  glaser _ et al _",
    "@xcite , etc . ) then , under the controllability condition which assumes that any @xmath24 can be generated by some control , this result was used to conclude the absence of traps for the underlying objective functional @xmath7 .",
    "later it was shown that the conclusion of the absence of traps requires an additional assumption that the map @xmath25 is non - degenerate  @xcite , meaning that arbitrary infinitesimal variations of @xmath6 produce variations of @xmath26 in all directions on @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "while the controllability condition is relatively easy to verify  @xcite , checking the non - degeneracy assumption turned out to be a hard problem .",
    "moreover , critical controls violating this assumption were found  @xcite , and even second - order traps ",
    "critical controls which are not global maxima and where the hessian @xmath27 is negative semidefinite were shown to exist under rather general assumptions  @xcite .",
    "( second - order traps are not necessarily local maxima but effectively they are traps for local algorithms exploiting at most second order local information about the objective ; see chapter  20 of  @xcite for a general discussion of the non - degeneracy and second order optimality conditions . )",
    "these findings led to reconsideration of the conclusion of absence of traps .",
    "some numerical simulations suggested that the condition of non - degeneracy might be generally satisfied or at least its violation does not produce multiple traps  @xcite , while other indicated possible trapping behavior  @xcite .",
    "however , numerical search is limited and the extent to which these runs span the full space of quantum control possibilities is questionable  @xcite . hence the problem of proving either existence or absence of traps has been remained open .",
    "our main result is that the only critical points of any objective of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath26 satisfies  ( [ eq1:2 ] ) and @xmath29 is any function on the special unitary group @xmath30 which has no local extrema , are global maxima , global minima , and the zero control field @xmath31 .",
    "important examples of such objectives include    * transition probability @xmath32 this objective is maximized by a control which completely transfers the initial state @xmath8 into the desired final state @xmath9 . *",

    "generation of a unitary process @xmath34 @xmath35 here @xmath34 is the unitary matrix representing a desired system evolution or a desired quantum gate , for example hadamard gate .",
    "maximum of this objective is achieved by a control such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is arbitrary ( generally unphysical ) phase .",

    "* proof of the main result .",

    "let @xmath64 be the state which is orthogonal to @xmath8 .",
    "taking @xmath65 and @xmath66 gives @xmath67 thus @xmath68 , i.e. either @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "the former case corresponds to the global minimum of the objective ( @xmath71 ) and the latter to its global maximum ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "these are the only allowed critical controls except of @xmath73 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the main result for @xmath74 .",
    "the analysis above immediately implies that if a linear map @xmath46 satisfies @xmath75 then @xmath76 .",
    "now we will show that it means that the map @xmath25 is non - degenerate everywhere outside of @xmath77 .",
    "since we consider objectives produced by functions on @xmath30 which therefore invariant with respect to the overall phase of @xmath26 , we can identify @xmath26 with the corresponding element of @xmath30 .",

    "if @xmath83 does not span @xmath61 , then there exists @xmath84 such that @xmath85 for all @xmath86 and hence @xmath87 .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath88 and hence the map can not be degenerate . therefore our result immediately implies the absence of traps at any @xmath89 for any objective functional @xmath90 which has no traps if considered as a function on @xmath30 .",
    "this includes important objectives @xmath91 $ ] for maximizing expectation of a system observable @xmath21 and @xmath92 for optimal generation of a unitary process @xmath34 ( e.g. , for unitary gate generation ) .",
    "these objectives appear to be trap - free for the lz system since functions @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath94 have no local maxima on @xmath30  @xcite .    the control @xmath73 requires a separate consideration since the condition @xmath95 for @xmath96 can not be used to conclude @xmath97 .",
    "this control is however not a trap for example for @xmath98 as shown by direct computation in the appendix .",
    "now we discuss important limitations for the present analysis .",
    "no real - world system will perfectly evolve according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1:2 ] ) and three general kinds of deviations from the ideal situation include decoherence effects , deviations of the actual control from the intended one due to noise or imperfections of the laboratory setup , and limited tunability of the control strength and time scales in laboratory experiments . while we consider the system as evolving according to the schrdinger equation with unitary evolution , in real circumstances it can experience additional influence of the environment which causes the dynamics to be non - unitary .",
    "we also assume that any shape of the control @xmath0 is available , whereas typical pulses are either piecewise constant or finite sums of cosines and sines at certain fixed frequencies .",
    "these assumptions are common for the first step of control landscape analysis which deals with the ideal situation of noiseless unconstrained controls .",
    "the next step upon establishment of the ideal landscape properties is to study the effects of possible deviations , which we discuss below for the lz system .",

    "<S> the analysis of traps , i.e. , locally but not globally optimal controls , for quantum control systems has attracted a great interest in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> the central problem that has been remained open is to demonstrate for a given system either existence or absence of traps . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the absence of traps and hence completely solve this problem for the important tasks of unconstrained manipulation of the transition probability and unitary gate generation in the landau - zener system  a system with a wide range of applications across physics , chemistry and biochemistry . </S>",
    "<S> this finding provides the first example of a controlled quantum system which is completely free of traps . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the impact of laboratory constraints due to decoherence , noise in the control pulse , and restrictions on the available controls which when being sufficiently severe can produce traps . </S>"
