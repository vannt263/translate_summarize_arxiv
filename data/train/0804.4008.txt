    "the history of star formation in the universe is of intense interest to many in astrophysics , and it is natural to pursue pushing the boundary of observations to as early of times as possible . our understanding of this history is increasing , with a consistent picture now emerging up to redshift @xmath1 , as summarized in fig .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) measurements from the compilation of @xcite are shown , along with new high-@xmath0 measurements based on observations of color - selected lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) @xcite and ly@xmath4 emitters ( lae ) @xcite .",
    "much current interest is on this high-@xmath0 frontier , where the primeval stars that may be responsible for reionizing the universe reside . due to the difficulties of making and interpreting these measurements ,",
    "different results disagree by more than their quoted uncertainties .",
    "instead of inferring the formation rate of massive stars from their observed populations , one may directly measure the sfr from their death rate , since their lives are short . while it is not yet possible to detect ordinary core - collapse supernovae at high @xmath0 , long - duration gamma - ray bursts , which have been shown to be associated with a special class of core - collapse supernovae @xcite , have been detected to @xmath5 .",
    "the brightness of grbs across a broad range of wavelengths makes them promising probes of the star formation history ( sfh ) ( see , e.g. , the early works of @xcite ) . in the last few years , _ _ swift _ _",
    "@xcite has spearheaded the detection of grbs over an unprecedentedly - wide redshift range , including many bursts at @xmath6 .",
    "surprisingly , examination of the _ swift _ data reveals that grb observations _ are not _ tracing the sfh directly , instead implying some kind of additional evolution @xcite .",
    "data ( the lae points only sample ly@xmath4 emitters ) .",
    "the results of this work , as inferred using bright _ swift _ gamma - ray bursts , are shown with dark diamonds .",
    "the solid line is our new high-@xmath0 fit given by eq .",
    "[ sfh ] ]    grbs can still reveal the overall amount of star formation , provided that we know how the grb rate couples to the sfr . in this study",
    ", we use the portion of the sfh that is sufficiently well - determined to probe the range beyond @xmath7 .",
    "we do this by relating the many bursts observed in @xmath8 to the corresponding sfr measurements , and by taking into account the possibility of additional evolution of the grb rate relative to the sfr .",
    "this calibration eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the absolute conversion factor between the sfr and the grb rate and allows us to properly relate the grb counts at @xmath9 to the sfr in that range .",
    "additionally , we make use of the estimated grb luminosities to exclude faint low-@xmath0 grbs that would not be visible in our high-@xmath0 sample , i.e. , to compare `` apples to apples '' .",
    "our results show that the sfr must be relatively high in the range @xmath2 when compared to sfr measurements made using more conventional techniques . while the grb statistics at high @xmath0 are relatively low , they are high enough , permitting an approach complementary to other sfr determinations , which themselves must contend with presently unknown extinction corrections , cosmic variance , and selection effects , most importantly that flux - limited surveys necessarily probe the brightest galaxies , which may only contain a small fraction of the star formation activity at early epochs .",
    "we discuss the implications these results in the context of reionization and broader applications .",
    "the relationship between the comoving grb and star formation rate densities can be parametrized as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 reflects the fraction of stars that produce long - duration grbs and any additional evolutionary effects .",
    "importantly , the sfh is well known for @xmath12 , and we use the @xcite fit in this range . the expected ( all - sky ) redshift distribution of grbs can be cast as @xmath13 where @xmath14 summarizes the ability both to detect the initial burst of gamma rays and to obtain a redshift from the optical afterglow , and includes observational factors such as instrumental sensitivities . beaming rendering some fraction of grbs unobservable from earth",
    "is accounted for through @xmath15 @xcite , the @xmath16 is due to cosmological time dilation of the observed rate , and @xmath17 is the comoving volume per unit redshift , where @xmath18 is the comoving distance , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21  km / s / mpc . ] .    both @xmath22 and @xmath11 are discussed in detail in @xcite , in which it has been shown that the former can be set to a constant ( @xmath23 ) by focusing on a bright subset of the grb sample , allowing the latter to be parametrized as @xmath24 , with @xmath25 ( an enhanced evolution of grbs ) preferred over @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is a ( unknown ) constant that includes the absolute conversion from the sfr to the grb rate in a given grb luminosity range .",
    "the evolutionary trend described by @xmath4 may arise from several mechanisms @xcite , such as a grb preference for low - metallicity environments @xcite , and must be accounted for to characterize @xmath28 .",

    "( 2007 ) , marked according to the primary method of redshift determination .",
    "the ratios of the number counts of grbs in the three shaded boxes are used to estimate the sfr density at high @xmath0 ( 45 , 57 ) by normalizing to the @xmath29 sfr , as discussed in the text .",

    "as only very bright bursts can be seen from all redshifts , we define a cut , based on the luminosities of the high-@xmath0 events , of @xmath35 erg s@xmath36 , for the subsample that we use to estimate the high-@xmath0 sfr , a lower @xmath37 threshold was used . ] .",
    "( a naive normalization using all grbs in @xmath38 without regard to luminosity would yield values @xmath39 times smaller . )",

    "( e.g. , @xcite ) and the human factor involved with optical observations makes a detailed treatment based on constructing the grb luminosity function at low @xmath0 and marginalizing over this distribution to obtain the sfr at high-@xmath0 practically challenging , if not impossible .",
    "the net effect would probably only be to make our eventual results somewhat larger .    the shaded boxes in fig .",
    "[ liso ] show three groups of grbs defined by this @xmath37 cut in @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( the high-@xmath0 boxes chosen to have equal counts ) .",
    "the grbs in @xmath29 act as a `` control group '' to base the grb to sfr conversion , since this range has both good sfr measurements and grb counting statistics .",
    "we calculate the `` expected '' number of grbs in this range as @xmath44 in which @xmath45 , an unknown normalization , depends on the total live - time , @xmath46 , and the angular sky coverage , @xmath47 . using the average sfr density , @xmath48",
    ", a similar relation can be written for @xmath49 and @xmath43 as @xmath50 our interest is in @xmath48 , which we find by dividing out @xmath51 , using eq .",

    "the decrease of @xmath55 at @xmath56 increasingly amplifies the significance of distant observed grbs .",
    "we show our new determinations of the high-@xmath0 sfr in fig .",
    "[ sfh ] , and how they compare with most of the conventional sfr results in this range would necessitate a rescaling ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ] .",
    "while evolution with @xmath57 ( 0 ) would decrease ( increase ) these values by a factor @xmath39 , it would also disagree with @xmath58 data .",
    "other changes in the details of our analysis , while changing the results somewhat , do not change the important point that the high-@xmath0 sfr must be relatively large to accommodate the several observed high-@xmath0 grbs .",
    "these details include the exclusion of a particular grb or changes in redshift assignments or ranges .",
    "taking into account the poisson confidence interval for 4 observed events , and slightly enlarging it , we assign a statistical uncertainty of a factor 2 up or down . as the number of grbs increases , this uncertainty will correspondingly decrease , and more attention will need to be placed on systematics.4 grbs from butler et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , none were observed in the @xmath59 1 year since then , indicative of a possible systematic effect . this will not change our results more than the quoted uncertainties . ] .",
    "our luminosity cut happens to restrict most of the grb redshifts used to have been obtained by absorption lines , reducing one possible source of error .",
    "we provide an update of the sfh fit of @xcite based on our grb results ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ sfh ] ) . here",
    "we adopt a continuous form of a broken power law , @xmath60^{1/\\eta } \\label{fit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) is the logarithmic slope of the first ( middle , last ) piece , and the normalization is @xmath64  yr@xmath36  mpc@xmath65 . using @xmath66 smoothes the transitions , while @xmath67 would recover the kinkiness of the original form .",
    "the breaks at @xmath68 and @xmath69 correspond to @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "our sfr results , particularly the @xmath72 point , are at the high end of sfr results obtained with more conventional methods , which show significant differences among themselves .",
    "likely , these methods are measuring different populations of galaxies , with the grbs probing low - luminosity galaxies that are otherwise not accounted for fully .",
    "as detailed , the statistics of the grb data are adequate , and it is unlikely that our grb results are overestimated , and if anything , the true sfr is even larger .",
    "we assume that a steep drop in the sfr is not being hidden by a steep rise in the fraction of stars that produce grbs , beyond the evolution already taken into account ; that would be even more interesting .",
    "the extent of extinction by dust on high-@xmath0 sfr measurements is not yet strongly constrained .",
    "there are a number of indications that dust is ubiquitous over the range @xmath73 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the dust correction in this range can be up to a factor of @xmath74 . at higher",
    "redshift , there are no strong observational constraints .",
    "the dust corrections assumed in @xcite are generally small at high @xmath0 ; on the other hand , observations verify the existence of at least one heavily - obscured galaxy at @xmath75 @xcite , and uv - selected samples would be expected to be biased against such objects .",
    "we also note that the recent mid - ir detection of the progenitor of sn 2008s implies that some short - lived stars do produce dust @xcite . for all of the lbg - based sfr results in fig .",
    "[ sfh ] , we have included the dust corrections indicated by the respective authors . while the true dust corrections may be larger , it seems likely that an additional factor of several is implausible .",
    "the lbg surveys are most sensitive to the brightest galaxies , and great efforts are made to define the uv galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) and how well it is sampled at the faint end .",
    "for example , the results shown in our fig .  [ sfh ] from @xcite are integrated down @xmath76 , for @xmath77 defined at @xmath78 . for the three lowest-@xmath0 points",
    ", they also integrate down to @xmath79 , yielding sfr results a factor of a few higher . correcting these measurements to account for the contributions from even fainter galaxies",
    "is necessary but difficult due to the poor observational constraints on the faint - end slope of the lf .",
    "depending on the value of this slope , and the lower limit of the integration , the necessary correction may be as little as a factor of two , or as much as an order of magnitude ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it also seems that ly@xmath4 emitters do not contribute significantly to the total sfr .",
    "we developed an empirical method for estimating the high-@xmath0 sfr using grb counts , improving on earlier estimates of the high-@xmath0 sfr using grb data ( e.g. , @xcite ) in several ways , not least of which by using significantly updated sfr @xcite and/or grb @xcite data . taking advantage of the improved knowledge of the sfr at intermediate @xmath0",
    ", we were able to move beyond the assumption of a simple one - to - one correspondence between the grb rate and the sfr , accounting for an increasing evolutionary trend .",
    "the higher statistics of the recent _ swift _ grb data allowed the use of luminosity cuts to fairly compare grbs in the full @xmath0 range , eliminating the uncertainty of the unknown grb luminosity function . by comparing the counts of grbs at different @xmath0 ranges ,",
    "normalized to sfr data at intermediate @xmath0 , we based our results squarely on data , eliminating the need for knowledge of the absolute fraction of stars that produce grbs .",
    "our grb - based sfr value in @xmath49 is comparable to more conventional results , which may be taken as a validation of our method , i.e. , possible selection effects have been adequately controlled ( see @xcite for more details ) , while our sfr value in @xmath72 is larger , which has important implications .",
    "a significant population of low - luminosity star - forming galaxies picked out by grbs but missed in other surveys could reconcile these differences ( searches utilizing cluster lensing , e.g. , @xcite , may help , if cosmic variance can be understood ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the correction for the faint - end of the lf should be large to correct for dwarf galaxies missed in lbg surveys .",
    "since grbs are observed to favor subluminous host galaxies @xcite , they may be probing such faint galaxies .",
    "the universe was fully reionized by @xmath80 @xcite , and it appears that agn could not have been responsible @xcite .",
    "can stars have reionized the universe ? in @xcite , the sfr density required to produce a sufficient ionizing photon flux",
    "is parametrized by two factors : the photon escape fraction ( @xmath81 ) and the clumpiness of the igm ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "these enter as a ratio , @xmath83 , which is not known precisely . for @xmath84 , the required sfr at @xmath85",
    "is @xmath86  yr@xmath36  mpc@xmath65 , just at the level of our grb - based sfr",
    ".    this ratio may be higher ( due to either @xmath82 or @xmath81 ) , however , which would render our measured value of @xmath87 too low , reintroducing the concern that star formation may be insufficient to achieve reionization ( e.g. , @xcite , c.  a.  faucher - giguere et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "is there any way around this ?",
    "one can plausibly increase our sfr determination by considering the increasing incompleteness of the grb sample with @xmath0 due to our @xmath37 cut , since for fixed luminosity , higher-@xmath0 bursts are relatively more difficult to detect @xcite and the universe will at some @xmath0 quickly become opaque blueward of ly@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if there is a _",
    "metallicity for forming a grb , then the evolutionary trend may saturate at high enough redshift ; arbitrarily assuming no evolution beyond @xmath6 would give an additional factor of @xmath88 . finally , requiring a _ minimum _ amount of metals in a star for a successful grb would suppress the grb rate at increasingly high-@xmath0 , necessitating a higher underlying sfr . a similar argument",
    "could be made concerning whether early , metal - poor stars possessed sufficient angular momentum .",
    "overall , more data are needed concerning the varying ionization fraction with redshift to establish if star formation is quantitatively acceptable as an explanation for reionization , instead of simply by default if agn have been eliminated .    the possibility of continuing evolution in the grb rate relative to the sfr invites some astrophysical speculations .",
    "while the overall black hole production rate in core - collapse supernovae is poorly understood empirically @xcite , bright grbs might be regarded as tracing the large angular momentum end of the black hole birth distribution ( e.g. , for collapsars ; @xcite ) .",
    "evolution would mean that the high-@xmath0 universe was more efficient at producing such black holes than usually considered .",
    "this may have implications for the nucleosynthetic yields from these explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of supernovae on the gas in high-@xmath0 galaxies is an ongoing field of research ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "following from the considerations above , it may be that small galaxies had a disproportionately large rate of grbs relative to normal supernovae .",
    "in this case , it would be interesting to examine the fate of such galaxies after including multiple injections of highly - asymmetric , relativistic ejecta , as well as implications for enrichment of the igm ( i.e. , `` grb feedback '' ) .",
