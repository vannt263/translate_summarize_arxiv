    "over the past 20 years , surface tension anisotropy has been discovered to be fundamental in determining solidification morphology . perhaps the greatest success was the discovery that anisotropy is required for the formation of stable cells and dendrites through a microscopic solvability condition @xcite .",

    "this is a generic feature of diffusion limited growth and exists in a variety of systems under isotropic or weakly anisotropic conditions , such as viscous fingering , bacterial colony growth , and electrodeposition @xcite .",
    "it was predicted for the solidification of a pure material that a transition from fractal to compact seaweed occurs with increasing undercooling @xcite . for a pure material , thermal undercooling increases with growth speed for both dendrites and doublons . at low speeds , perturbations at the tip lead to tip splitting while at higher speeds they convect away @xcite .",
    "the basis of the compact seaweed is the doublon , or symmetry - broken dendrite , in which two asymmetric cells grow cooperatively such that there is a parabolic envelope over the pair of cells and a thin liquid gap of well - defined size separating them @xcite .",
