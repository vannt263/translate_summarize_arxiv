    "population i wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are characterised by dense , fast stellar winds giving the stars their broad emission - line spectra and carrying heavy mass loss : they represent the last stable stage in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "one of the earliest results from infrared ( ir ) astronomy was the discovery of ` excess ' radiation by heated circumstellar dust from a variety of stars known to be losing mass .",
    "amongst these were three wc9 type wr stars , observed by allen , harvey & swings ( 1972 ) .",
    "subsequent studies ( e.g. cohen , barlow & kuhi 1975 ) found circumstellar dust emission from most wc9 and many wc8 stars .",
    "the process was soon inverted , and bright ir sources discovered in space- or ground - based ir surveys were found to harbour optically faint dusty wc89 stars ( e.g. afgl2104 = wr112 , cohen & kuhi 1977 ) . amongst these was wr48a , discovered by danks et al .",
    "( 1983 , hereafter ddws ) in a survey of the hii region g305.5 + 0.0 .",
    "they observed wr48a to be undergoing an infrared outburst similar to that shown in 1977 by hd 193793 ( williams et al .",
    "1978 , hackwell , gehrz & grasdalen 1979 ) .",
    "ddws tracked the rise of the ir emission to maximum in 1979 and its initial fading , and presented a spectrum showing he and c emission lines , most conspicuously hei 10830  and ciii 9710 , from which they classified wr48a as a wc9 star .    in their survey of ir dust emission by late subtype wc stars ,",
    "williams , van der hucht & th ( 1987a , hereafter wht ) , reported photometry of wr48a in 198286 which showed continuing fading of its dust emission .",
    "they also extended the spectroscopy to the yellow ( 55505950 ) , and argued from the approximately equal intensities in the ciii 5696-  and civ 5808-  classification lines that wr48a was a wc8 star .",
    "further ir photometry of wr48a was reported by williams et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter paper  i ) , showing that the fading continued to about 1997 , but that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at that time still showed dust emission , indicating that dust was still being formed by wr48a . in this respect",
    "it differed from ` episodic ' dust makers like hd 193793 ( wr140 ) , which form dust for only a fraction of their periods ( williams et al .",
    "the ir photometry of wr48a also showed secondary dust - formation episodes , ` mini eruptions ' , in 1990 and 1994 .",
    "these resembled those observed by williams et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in another episodic dust maker , the wc7+o9 system wr137 ( hd 192641 ) . in paper",
    "i , the 2.425-@xmath3 m sed of wr48a observed with the short - wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on _ iso _ in a survey of wr spectra ( van der hucht et al .",
    "1996 ) was compared with that of wr104 ( ve245 ) , the classical dust - making wc9 star , and found to be significantly cooler .",
    "this difference was consistent with the radial dust density distribution around wr48a being flatter than the @xmath4 law expected of a system making dust at a constant rate like wr104 : the evolution of the dust density distribution of wr48a is considered further in section [ smodels ] .",
    "the _ iso_-sws spectrum of wr48a presented in paper  i showed an emission feature near 7.7 @xmath3 m similar to that observed in wr104 and wr112 by cohen , tielens & bregman ( 1989 ) and ascribed to a carbonaceous carrier with small aromatic domains , a possible precurson to carbon grains ; an independent study of the sws spectrum by chiar , peeters & tielens ( 2002 ) identified and discussed emission features at 6.4@xmath3 m and 7.9@xmath3 m .",
    "the enduring interest of dust formation by wr stars is the great difficulty in forming dust in such hostile environments : close to the stars , the stellar radiation fields would heat any dust to above its evaporation temperature but at greater distances , where the radiation field is sufficiently diluted , the density of the wr stellar wind is too low to allow homonuclear dust condensations  as recognised early on by hackwell et .",
    "1979 ) in the case of wr140 and discussed by wht for the wc89 stars making dust persistently . zubko ( 1998 ) found that carbon grains having drift velocities relative to the wc89 wind could grow via collision with carbon ions , but the question of grain nucleation remains open .",
    "a chemical kinetic study of the formation of molecular species and carbon grain precursors in wc9 winds by cherchneff et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that only c@xmath5 was formed in useful amounts , and even that required significantly ( factor @xmath6 ) higher densities than expected in the regions of isotropic , smooth wr winds where dust grains are observed .",
    "understanding the physicochemical process of dust formation by wr stars appears to have stalled , but the incidence of observed dust formation by wr stars in different systems provides valuable information on the origin of the significantly higher densities demanded .    large - scale , high - density structures in a wr wind are provided by compression of the stellar wind in strong shocks formed where the wind of a wr star collides with that of a sufficiently luminous companion in a binary system  a colliding wind binary ( cwb )  as occurs in wr140 .",
    "usov ( 1991 ) suggested that very high compression factors ( @xmath7 ) could be produced in wr140 if the heated and compressed wind was able to cool efficiently .",
    "the link between the dust - formation episodes and binary orbit in wr140 is provided by the periodic increases by factor of @xmath8 40 of the pre - shock wind density at the wind - collision region ( wcr ) for a brief time around periastron passage ( williams 1999 ) in its very elliptical orbit .",
    "similarly , lefvre et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the episodic dust - maker wr137 was a spectroscopic binary having a period ( 13.05 yr ) equal to that of the dust - formation episodes ( williams et al .",
    "2001 ) , with periastron passage about a year before maximum dust emission .",
    "more recently , williams , rauw & van der hucht ( 2009a ) showed that the radial velocities of the wc5+o9 system wr19 were consistent with its being a high - eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) binary , having periastron passage shortly before its brief , periodic ( 10.1-yr ) dust - formation episodes .",
    "the connection between the persistent dust - formation by the wc9 stars and their movement in binary orbits comes from ir images of the dust , which show rotating ` pinwheel ' structures around wr104 , wr98a ( iras 173803031 ) and wr112 , interpreted to be dust formed and ejected in a stream to one side of a rotating binary system observed at a relatively low orbital inclination ( tuthill , monnier & danchi 1999 , monnier , tuthill , & danchi 1999 , and monnier et al .",
    "the observation of non - thermal radio emission from the ` pinwheel ' systems ( monnier et al . 2002 ) provides further support for their being cwbs ; but their stellar components have not yet been resolved , so that it has not been possible to relate the positions of the stars and wcrs to that of the dust .",
    "monnier et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found the dust emission by wr48a to be extended at 2@xmath3 m ; and the dust cloud was imaged at 12.3@xmath3 m by marchenko & moffat ( 2007 ) , showing the dust emission to be extended e  w , suggesting a flattened structure , possibly a fragmentary spiral , seen at moderately high inclination .",
    "ddws and danks et al .",
    "( 1984 ) associated wr48a with two newly discovered galactic clusters , danks  1 ( c 1310624 ) and danks  2 ( c 1309624 ) at a distance between @xmath8 3.3 and 4.6 kpc .",
    "bica et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived colour - magnitude diagrams from deeper photometry and derived distances to the clusters of @xmath10 and @xmath11 kpc respectively .",
    "the connection between wr48a and the clusters was reinforced by clark & porter ( 2004 ) in their study of star formation in the region .",
    "they suggested that star formation might have been triggered by wr48a and adopted a distance of 4 kpc for the complex .",
    "this gives a greater distance to wr48a than that ( 1.2  kpc , van der hucht 2001 ) implied by its spectral type , and these estimates need to be reconciled .    by all accounts ,",
    "wr48a is heavily reddened , but the exact value is not certain .",
    "ddws derived a@xmath12 9.2 from the 700010000-  colour in their spectrum .",
    "williams , van der hucht & th ( 1987b ) derived a@xmath13 from the 50007000-  slope in their spectrum observed in 1986 , and noted that this was consistent with the strength of the 6284-  diffuse interstellar absorption band ( dib ) and the relation between these quantities from other reddened stars . from the @xmath14 sws spectrum of wr48a , schutte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found the interstellar ` silicate ' feature to have @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio of visual extinction to ` silicate ' optical depth in the spectra of wr stars and cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 showed significant scatter , @xmath16 . applying this ratio to",
    "the @xmath17 observed in wr48a gives @xmath18 .",
    "( a lower value , @xmath19 ( 6.1 ) , was derived from @xmath17 in paper  i but this used a different and probably inappropriate calibration . ) baume , carraro & momany ( 2009 ) observed @xmath20 photometry in 2006 , and derived @xmath21 . for a standard reddening law , this implies a lower extinction and , from their observed @xmath22 , an intrinsic @xmath23 , which is abnormally red for an early type star .",
    "if some of the extinction occurs in the carbon dust made by wr48a , the extinction law may not be standard .",
    "for example , menzies & feast ( 1997 ) found an anomalous reddening law for the carbon dust made by the rcb star ry sgr , so the sightline to wr48a may have a reddening law intermediate between the standard interstellar and that for carbon dust . on the other hand ,",
    "the circumstellar component of the reddening is unlikely to be very great , given the strength of the ` silicate ' feature and the reddening to the associated clusters @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ( bica et al . ) . for the present , therefore , we adopt @xmath26 and a standard interstellar law for the reddening of wr48a .",
    "zhekov , gagn & skinner ( 2011 ) have identified a strong , highly obscured x - ray source with wr48a .",
    "they pointed out that , if wr48a was physically associated with the clusters danks 1 and danks 2 at a distance of @xmath27kpc , it would be the most x - ray luminous wr star in the galaxy , after cyg x-3",
    ". they also derived a high extinction , @xmath28 @xmath29 , from their nei shock modelling of the x - ray spectrum and noted that this was consistent with @xmath30 using the standard conversion , @xmath31 @xmath29 ; but @xmath19 could be 40 - 50% higher using more recent conversions . as one of several possible origins for the x - ray emission , they considered colliding stellar winds in a wide wr+o binary . as noted by zhekov et al . , and also mauerhan , van dyk & morris ( 2011 ) , wr48a was detected with _",
    "chandra _ as a very strong x - ray source .    in this paper",
    ", we report almost three decades ( 19822011 ) of ir photometry tracking the emission by the dust cloud made by wr48a and showing that the 19789 dust - formation was not an isolated event , but one which appears to be recurring after an interval of over 32 yrs .",
    "we present optical spectra which suggest that the wc8 star in wr48a has an ob companion , apparently an oe or be star .",
    "we use the ir colours and simple modelling of the seds to describe the evolution of the dust cloud and develop a preliminary picture of wr48a as a colliding - wind binary .",
    ".near - infrared photometry of wr48a with eso telescopes : except where marked ( * 3.6 m , + 2.2 m ) , observations were made with the 1-m photometric telescope . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the long - term infrared photometry of wr48a shows complex behaviour different from that of any other wr star : a slow , large - amplitude variation on which are superimposed briefer variations of lower amplitude . in all cases in which they can be determined , the trajectories in the ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath1 colour - magnitude diagram are loops ( clockwise in figs [ cmd ] and [ cmdhs ] ) indicative of the formation of new , hot dust , followed by its cooling .",
    "the recurrence time - scale for the slow variation is 32 + yrs ; although the 201011 nir photometry reached the levels of the earliest ( 197879 ) pre - maximum photometry by ddws , the interval can not be translated into a period owing to the superimposed short - term variations , and further observations capturing at least the maximum and early decline are needed for a period . even without a period ,",
    "there is enough evidence to consider wr48a as a cwb periodic dust - maker and discuss it in that context .",
    "the total dust luminosity at maximum ( 1979 ) is 13@xmath32 that in 1996 , near minimum , implying a variable rate of dust formation assuming a constant wind dispersing the dust .",
    "the rate of dust formation is better estimated from the short wavelength flux sensitive to the hottest , newly formed dust and the range in @xmath33 between maximum and minimum ( adjusted for the stellar contribution ) gives a factor @xmath34 .",
    "the fraction of the wc8 wind going into the wcr is determined by the angular size of the wcr , which depends on the wind - momentum ratio @xmath35 , which does not change around the orbit if the winds collide at their terminal velocities , but the pre - shock wind density at the wcr does change with the stellar separation if the orbit is elliptical . if maximum and minimum dust formation coincide with periastron and apastron passages in an elliptical orbit , and if the dust formation rate is proportional to the pre - shock wind density at the wcr , the stellar separation varies by a factor of @xmath36 and the orbital eccentricity would be @xmath37 , with periastron passages in 1979 and some time after mid-2011 .",
    "the mini eruptions appear not to be periodic , arguing against the suggestion in paper i of a third stellar component in wr48a , and other large - scale overdensity structures which are intercepted by the wcr as it moves through the winds are implied .",
    "the only other system having mini outbursts superimposed on its long - term dust - formation variation is wr137 .",
    "this is one of the few wr stars to have significant continuum polarization and wind asymmetry ( harries , hiller & howarth 1998 ) .",
    "harries , babler & fox ( 2000 ) pointed out the similarity of wr137 to wr6 and wr134 , which display periodic variability in their emission - line morphology possibly caused by the rotation of large - scale azimuthal structures within their flattened winds .",
    "polarization observations of wr48a are needed to to see if this is the case here .",
    "also , the h@xmath38 emission associated with the companion suggests that this might have a flattened wind and large - scale structures .    the persistence of dust formation even at ir minimum classifies wr48a as a variable dust maker like wr98a , which has a period near 564 d. determined from both the rotation of its dust pinwheel ( monnier et al . 1999 ) and nir photometry ( paper  i ) .",
    "the recurrence time - scale of wr48a much longer than this , and the periods of the episodic dust makers , of which the longest is 13.05 yrs for wr137 , both from ir photometry ( williams et al .",
    "2001 ) and the rv orbit ( lfevre et al . 2005 ) , and even the orbital period , 24.8 yr , of the persistent dust - maker wr112 inferred from its multi - arc dust cloud ( marchenko et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the relevance of the long period is the implied size of the orbit ( for stellar systems of similar mass ) , with implications for the wind - collision process , particularly whether the post - shock wc wind is radiative or adiabatic .",
    "radiative cooling in the post - shock wc wind is important for dust formation ( usov 1991 ) .",
    "it was discussed by stevens , blondin & pollock ( 1992 ) , who introduced the cooling parameter , @xmath39 : the ratio of the time - scales for cooling of the shocked gas and its escape from the apex of the wcr to flow downstream , and given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the wind velocity in units of 1000 km  s@xmath42 , @xmath43 is the separation of the stars in units of @xmath44 cm , and @xmath45 is the star s mass - loss rate in units of @xmath46 m@xmath47 yr@xmath42 .",
    "stevens et al .",
    "considered a wind with @xmath48 to be adiabatic and @xmath49 to be radiative ; recent hydrodynamical simulations by parkin & pittard ( 2008 ) find a higher threshold , with the compressed wind cooling rapidly if @xmath50 .",
    "the wcr in a system having a very elliptical orbit , like wr140 , can vary between adiabatic and radiative as the stellar separation varies , becoming radiative close to periastron  the only time that dust forms in that system . in the case of wr48a we know none of @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 , but",
    "can estimate @xmath39 very roughly .",
    "if the stars in wr48a have masses comparable to those in the @xmath51 vel system they would have @xmath52 in a @xmath53 yr period circular orbit . adopting a wind velocity of 1200 km  s@xmath42 ( section [ sopt ] ) and assuming a mass - loss rate of @xmath54 m@xmath47 yr@xmath42 , we have @xmath55 for the wr48a wcr .",
    "this is significantly above the threshold and indicates an adiabatic wcr  which does not favour dust formation . in an elliptical orbit , the separation and",
    "hence @xmath39 would be smaller near periastron ( e.g. @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) ; but they would be larger at apastron  and we know from the observations that dust forms throughout the orbit .",
    "the dust formation by wr112 raises a similar problem : for the same stellar masses , the stars would have @xmath58 in an orbit having @xmath59 ( marchenko et al . 2002 ) and @xmath60 for the same estimates of mass loss and velocity , which are also those used in their modelling by marchenko et al .",
    "higher mass - loss rates would result in lower values of @xmath39 , as would lower wind velocities , which enter with the fourth power .",
    "wind velocities below @xmath61 km  s@xmath42 would give values of @xmath62 and possibly radiatively cooling winds .",
    "the velocities of both stars need to be measured from high - resolution spectra to advance the question of the cooling of the post - shock winds and the conditions allowing their dust formation .",
    "velocities are also needed to aid interpretation of the dust images of the two stars .    the recurrence of dust formation , the dilution of the wc emission lines implying presence of a luminous companion , the anomalous emission in h@xmath38 ( and possible h@xmath63 and br@xmath51 ) supporting this , and the strong x - ray emission reported by zhekov et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) all point to wr48a being a long - period cwb .",
    "the ir photometry needs to be extended to determine a period and characterise the ` mini ' outburst and the spectrum needs to be re - observed at higher resolution and s / n to elucidate the types of both components and determine the wc wind velocity to further the consideration of the conflict between observed dust formation and an apparently adiabatic post - shock wind .",
    "knowledge of the wind cooling will also be valuable in understanding the x - ray flux from wr48a and its long term variation .",
    "the long period of the system suggests that any non - thermal radio emission from the wcr will have little difficulty in escaping the wind ( cf .",
    "dougherty & williams 2000 ) .",
    "its distance is comparable to that of wr112 ( 4  kpc , van der hucht 2001 ) , which shows variable non - thermal radio emission at the level of @xmath8 a few mjy ( chapman et al . 1999 , monnier et al . 2002 ) , so we expect the similar flux levels from wr48a if the stars have similar winds , but with greater amplitude of variation given the greater eccentricity and inclination of the wr48a system .",
    "the long - term observing campaign reported here would have been impossible without the active support of many individuals and observatories .",
