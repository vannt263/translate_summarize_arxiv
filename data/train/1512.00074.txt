    "<S> there are many terms , and their effects depend on the form of the velocity terms . in order to organize the behavior </S>",

    "<S> , we conclude that @xmath12 defines a @xmath14 weak ti , while @xmath13 defines a @xmath15 strong ti  @xcite . while these topological indices depend on the details of the band structure away from the ddp , the difference between them for the @xmath12- and @xmath13-dominated phases is robust . to visualize the phases , fig . </S>",

    "<S> different combinations of velocity terms lead to different choices for the anticommuting mass terms . </S>",

    "<S> the dependence of the topological state on @xmath18 and @xmath19 provides a mechanism for controlling topological states using strain . </S>",
    "<S> as indicated in fig.[fig2](b , c ) , uniaxial strain along the @xmath20 or @xmath21 directions induces a perturbation with a combination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 symmetry , while uniaxial strain along the diagonal @xmath24 directions has @xmath22 and @xmath25 symmetry . therefore these two kinds of compressive strain lead to topologically distinct insulators .        </S>",

    "<S> , this @xmath28 invariant is inaccessible in a 4 band system because it derives via dimensional reduction  @xcite from a _ third _ chern number in @xmath31d , which requires at least 8 bands . to establish that a line defect binds a 1d helical mode , we follow the analysis of ref . , and consider a simple model with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",

    "<S> we finally briefly consider perturbations in table [ table3 ] with the remaining symmetries , which lead to weyl or dirac semimetals . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 perturbations lead to either dirac points or a dirac ring , with fourfold - degenerate crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the inversion breaking - perturbations generally lead to a weyl semimetal with twofold crossings , except for @xmath39 , where the remaining @xmath40 and glide mirror symmetries guarantee doubly - degenerate states for @xmath41 with the same @xmath40 eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> this allows degenerate bands to cross along @xmath7-@xmath42 , protecting a dirac point even though inversion is violated .    </S>",

    "<S> see the supplementary material for the methods.,width=302 ]    encouragingly , the ddp appears to be feasible in known materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a ternary bismuth aurate , bi@xmath0auo@xmath43 in sg 130 , which has been synthesized in a single crystal  @xcite , hosts a ddp at @xmath7 close to the fermi level , with additional four - fold degeneracies appearing on @xmath45-@xmath44 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . as for materials in sg 135 , the materials project  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that a class of oxide materials isostructural with pb@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite , including sn(pbo@xmath0)@xmath0 , pb@xmath1o@xmath2 , and mg(pbo@xmath0)@xmath0 , host the ddps in the valence energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> although they are semiconductors with electron filling 8 , their atomic structure allows for a potential route towards a material design that shifts the dirac point near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the number of atoms per each species in a unit cell is 4 ( mod 8) and thus allows for filling 4 when suitably substituting atoms with an odd number of valence electrons . in sg 223 , gamo@xmath1  @xcite hosts a ddp . </S>",
