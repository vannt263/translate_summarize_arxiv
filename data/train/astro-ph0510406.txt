    "one of the most intriguing results gleaned from the intense study of the first - year data of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) is the possible detection of irregularities in the temperature field of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "one interpretation is that the temperature field is not a gaussian random field , i.e. , when it is expanded in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath8 the modes @xmath9 are not gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath10 , where @xmath11 standard inflationary cosmology predicts a random gaussian field .",
    "thus non - gaussianity , if it exists , leads to the conclusion that the standard inflationary paradigm is incomplete or incorrect ( see , e.g. ,  2 of copi , huterer , & starkman 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "however , there are other plausible interpretations for temperature field irregularities : they may indicate unknown sources of foreground emission in the cmb bandpass ; they may be an artifact of an unknown problem with the _ wmap _ instrument ; or they may be an artifact of the algorithm by which the temperature field maps are generated .",
    "a number of different approaches have been applied in the search for irregularities in the _ wmap _ data .",
    "komatsu et al .  ( 2003 ) use techniques based on both the angular bispectrum and minkowski functionals to determine that the _ wmap _ data are consistent with gaussianity , while patanchon et al .  ( 2004 ) apply a blind multi - component analysis and achieve the same conclusion , while at the same time finding evidence of weak residual foreground emission in the _ wmap _ q - band .",

    "( 2004 ) and mcewen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) use wavelet - based techniques and examine the skewness and kurtosis of wavelet coefficients , finding deviations from gaussianity of significance  =  @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a sampling distribution for statistic @xmath14 given that the null hypothesis is true , and @xmath15 is the observed statistic .",
    "conventionally , the alternate hypothesis is accepted if @xmath16  0.05 , although the standard of acceptance is a subjective choice .",
    "note that the phrases  more significant \" and  less significant \" refer to the value @xmath17 being _ smaller _ and _ larger _ respectively . ]",

    "( 2004 ) examine the unusual alignments of the quadrupole and octopole planes ; the latter concludes that the alignments are unlikely at the @xmath17  =  10@xmath19 level , and note that three of the four planes are orthogonal to the ecliptic plane , while the fourth is orthogonal to the supergalactic plane , supporting the hypothesis that unmodeled foregrounds are a tangible cause of irregularities in the data .",
    "vale ( 2005 ) proposes that these improbable alignments are a by - product of another foreground contamination mechanism , the weak lensing of the cmb dipole by local large - scale structures .",
    "other researchers have looked at differences between standard hemispheres ( galactic and ecliptic ) and arbitrarily defined hemispheres .",

    "they find that the north pole ( np ) direction for maximum asymmetry shifts from the galactic np toward the galactic plane as the lowest @xmath0 values are excluded from the analysis , and they conclude that the orientation of the np at higher @xmath0 values indicates that residual foreground contamination is unlikely .",
    "eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004b ) follow up this work using minkowski functionals and skeleton length to ascertain non - gaussianity in the northern galactic hemisphere at the @xmath18 10@xmath19 level .",
    "park ( 2004 ) uses a similar mathematical framework and finds a difference between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres and an asymmetry in the southern hemisphere , both significant at the @xmath20 0.01 level .",
    "hansen et al .",
    "( 2004b ) use a local - curvature method and find non - gaussian features when considering the northern and southern galactic hemispheres separately at the @xmath18 0.01 level , and find that maximum asymmetry occurs when the np is close to north ecliptic pole , suggesting a foreground effect .",
    "larson & wandelt ( 2004 ) examine extrema outside the most conservative _ wmap _ foreground mask ( kp0 mask ) and in addition to rejecting the gaussian hypothesis on the whole sky , they find the variance of maxima and minima to be low ( @xmath17  =  0.01 ) in the ecliptic northern hemisphere but consistent with the null in the southern hemisphere .",
    "these results indicate that the evidence for irregularities in the _ wmap _ data is tantalizing , though ambiguous , and that there is as yet no consensus as to its root cause . however , the hints of special alignments of hemispheres for which power asymmetry is maximized , as well as special alignments of the quadrupole and octopole planes , suggest that an incomplete knowledge of foregrounds may play a leading role .",

    "wmap _ team , and",
    "thus have not examined how the choices made by the _ wmap _ team in making maps ( hinshaw et al .  2003a , hereafter hinshaw i ) affect the evidence for irregularities in the data .",
    "for this reason , we have independently developed map - making software that operates on the first - year calibrated time - ordered _ wmap _ data , and we analyze the resulting maps to determine : ( a ) if there is statistically significant asymmetry between arbitrarily defined hemispheres ; and ( b ) if altering the map - making algorithm affects the observed results .    in  [ sect : map ] , we review the basics of map - making and discuss our own map - making algorithm , which we have created through the study of hinshaw i and discussions with the _ wmap _ team . in  [ sect : powspec ] , we analyze foreground - corrected , co - added q- , v- , and/or w - band maps to determine asymmetry as a function of direction and to estimate significance both as a function of direction and globally over the whole sphere . in  [ sect : mapassume ] , we determine how the distribution of observed asymmetry values and the direction and significance of the maximum value are affected by altering the map - making algorithm . in  [ sect : conc ] , we provide a summary and conclusions , while in the appendix we provide complete details of our map - making recipe .",
    "we begin by reviewing the theory underlying the making of maps for _ wmap _ ; we direct the interested reader to wright , hinshaw , & bennett ( 1996 ) , wright ( 1996 ) , tegmark ( 1997 ) , and hinshaw i for more detail .",
    "the goal of map - making is to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the true sky map @xmath21 ( where the subscript @xmath22 indicates data as a function of sky pixel ) , which is associated with the time - ordered data @xmath23 via the relation @xmath24 where the subscript @xmath25 indicates data as a function of time , @xmath26 is the pixel - to - time mapping matrix , and @xmath27 is the vector of samples from the noise distribution .    to simplify the problem , it is assumed that @xmath28 , i.e. , each noise sample is independent and the sampling distribution is the normal distribution with time - independent variance @xmath29 .",

    "we determine the smallest multipole ranges for which @xmath103  0.05 ; we find twelve such ranges , including @xmath0  =  [ 2,3 ] and [ 6,7 ] , for which @xmath136 0 .",
    "contour plots made for these ranges indicates an association between the direction of maximum asymmetry and the ecliptic plane ( four of twelve directions within @xmath6 4@xmath44 and eight within @xmath6 20@xmath44 ; @xmath121 0.01 ) , although one must be mindful of the coarseness of our coordinate grid . at large scales , the contours of least significance ( @xmath120 0.2 - 0.5 ) may be fit by eye with great circles inclined relative to the ecliptic plane , with inclinations of @xmath6 30@xmath44 and 90@xmath44 for @xmath0  =  [ 2,3 ] and [ 6,7 ] respectively .",
    "we find that the @xmath0  =  [ 2,3 ] great circle is insensitive to frequency and that it passes over preferred quadrupole and octopole axes derived by de oliveira - costa et al .  and schwarz et al . , as well as the pointing direction of the cmb dipole .",
    "we test the robustness of our results by using examining the effect of map - making algorithmic assumptions upon asymmetry .",
    "we create and analyze new maps after changing the monopole temperature , the magnitude of the dipole velocity , the masks , the method of interpolation used to determine the pointing direction of radiometer normal vectors as a function of time , the planetary cut , and the relative normalizations of the foreground maps . in virtually all cases , the alterations had little to no effect upon asymmetry either for the range @xmath0  =  [ 2,64 ] or at the largest scales .",
    "an exception to this is the magnitude of the dipole velocity : we find that increasing it has a marked effect on the direct ( i.e. , uncorrected ) estimate of quadrupole power in the kp2+hemisphere cut skies , increasing power in both the northern and southern hemispheres such that asymmetry approaches unity ( and becomes insignificant ) .",
    "changing the magnitude of the dipole velocity is a frequency - independent change , consistent with observations that the significance of asymmetry is frequency - independent .",
    "if the true dipole velocity magnitude is @xmath6 1 - 3@xmath7 larger than the current value , large - scale asymmetry may disappear .",
    "however , it will not influence asymmetry estimates at smaller scales , nor appreciably change full - sky power spectra .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of hansen i that whatever causes asymmetry at large scales is not what causes it at smaller scales ; however , they posit that galactic contamination is the cause of large - scale asymmetry .",
    "the effect of changing the magnitude of the dipole velocity , along with the observation of structures in our contour plots that follow great circles inclined relative to the ecliptic plane , suggests that the observed power asymmetry may be ( at least partially ) caused by the use of an incorrect dipole vector in combination with a systematic or foreground process that is associated with the ecliptic .",
    "the natural next steps are to determine the dipole velocity vector that minimizes asymmetry ( with error bars ) , to make new maps based on that vector , and to examine the frequency dependence of any remaining significant asymmetry to attempt to differentiate between systematic or foreground causes . however , without the ability to recalibrate the first - year _ wmap _ data , such an exercise may not yield accurate results .",
    "we thus would ask that both raw time - ordered data and calibration software be made available to the public in future data releases .",

    "in this appendix , we lay out the details of our map - making algorithm , summarized in  [ sect : map ] .",
    "we begin by assuming two values : the velocity of the sun relative to the cmb rest frame in galactic coordinates , @xmath61  =  ( @xmath6226.26,@xmath62243.71,274.63 ) km s@xmath5 ( bennett i ) , and the monopole temperature @xmath126  =  2.725 k ( mather et al . ) .",

    "the masking column in this file is bit - coded ; we examine bit 5 to set the processing foreground mask , which is the kp8 mask with no edge smoothing .",
    "we do not apply the point source mask , as we expect point sources to have little effect on results for @xmath4  64 .",
    "the making of maps involves four embedded loops : looping over iteration number , looping over the 366 time - ordered data ( tod ) files,[multiblock footnote omitted ] looping over the science frames within each tod file , and looping over the data vector contained within each science frame .    during each loop",
    ", we open and read each tod file , as opposed to keeping their contents in memory after a first reading .",
    "( this is not strictly necessary ; see  [ sect : comp ] below . )",
    "each tod file contains five tables , of which we are interested in three : the meta data , line - of - sight ( los ) , and science data tables .",
    "each meta data table contains 1875 rows ( recorded every 46.08 s , or 30 science frames ) .",
    "we extract from this table elements of the time column , the spacecraft position column ( needed for determining planetary positions ) , the spacecraft velocity column , and the column containing the 33 @xmath37 4 quaternion matrices that encode the spacecraft orientation for each of science frame ( the extra 3 elements provide seamless interpolation ; see below ) .",
    "the spacecraft position and velocity are given in celestial coordinates ; they are converted to galactic coordinates as detailed below .",
    "the los table contains the orientation of each radiometer horn in spacecraft coordinates , which we extract once .",
    "this information , combined with the information from the quaternion matrices , allows us to determine the normal vector for each radiometer horn in galactic coordinates , and thus the map pixel numbers associated with each radiometer as a function of time .",
    "we return to this below .",
    "each science data table contains 56250 rows ( 30@xmath371875 ) , corresponding to science frames of length 1.536 s. from each row , we extract a data vector of length @xmath138 ( = 15 for q - band data , 20 for v - band data , and 30 for w - band data ) , and a status code .",

    "an interpolated quaternion is computed , using a lagrange interpolating polynomial formulation provided by the _",
    "wmap _ team ( g.  hinshaw & p.  butterworth , private communication ) .",
    "this formulation requires the quaternions for the previous , current , and following two science frames .",
    "we calculate the time @xmath140 between that of the datum and the beginning of the current science frame , and convert this to a fractional offset @xmath1411.536 s. we then define four weights : @xmath142 and determine the four elements of the interpolated quaternion : @xmath143 where @xmath144 represents a science frame . the next step is to normalize @xmath145 and to convert it to a transformation matrix ( here we drop the ",
    "int \" subscript ) : @xmath146 this transformation matrix is in turn used to convert the radiometer horn normal vector @xmath147 from spacecraft to celestial coordinates : @xmath148 we then convert to galactic coordinates using the transformation matrix @xmath149 where @xmath150  =  282.85948@xmath44 , @xmath151  =  327.06808@xmath44 , and @xmath152  =  62.871750@xmath44 .",

    "the next step is to determine the doppler shift of the monopole relative to the spacecraft .",
    "the spacecraft velocity is recorded every 46.08 seconds , as noted above . because the velocity varies little during that amount of time",
    ", it is not strictly necessary to interpolate to determine velocities for each datum .",
    "( however , we have made the choice to linearly interpolate the velocities . )",
    "we convert the velocity associated with the datum from celestial to galactic coordinates : @xmath155 now we can remove the contribution of the doppler - shifted monopole from the datum ( here , we drop the  gal \" subscript ) : actually consists of contributions from the cmb and foregrounds .",
    "one can correct for the foregrounds during mapping by subtracting @xmath156 and ( if desired ) @xmath157 from @xmath49 , along with the contribution of the doppler - shifted monopole .",
    "the latter factor assumes that the foreground emitters are stationary in the barycenter frame of reference .",
    "we find that the difference between performing foreground corrections during mapping and after mapping is negligible ( @xmath76 1 @xmath60k in each sky map pixel ) . ] @xmath158 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and update the temperature map and the counter recording how many times each pixel is observed : @xmath159 and @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the current iteration ( @xmath162 is the input zero - temperature map ) .",
    "the counter is actually updated during only the first iteration as @xmath41 does not change from iteration to iteration . as noted in  [ sect : map ] , we assume the statistical weight @xmath70  =  1.0 for all data , as the first - year data release does not contain information on the statistical weighting model used by the _ wmap _ team . at the end of a given iteration , we divide by @xmath41 to determine the weighted average .    equation ( [ eqn : ta ] ) is skipped ( i.e. , the map is not updated ) if pixel @xmath43 lies within the processing mask , while equation ( [ eqn : tb ] ) is skipped if pixel @xmath42 is within the mask . both equations are skipped if either pixel @xmath42 or @xmath43 is within an angle of @xmath72 degrees of any outer planet ( except pluto ; see  [ sect : planet ] below ) .",

    "the _ wmap _ team , which like us uses a zero - temperature input map , determines the zero - point by fitting a function of the form @xmath163 to southern galactic hemisphere data below @xmath82  =  @xmath6215@xmath44 for each map ( bennett i ) .",
    "we apply a constant offset to our maps such that the mean pixel temperature matches that of the _ wmap _ maps .      in theory , we should determine the positions of all outer planets in each science frame . however , position determination is a major computational bottleneck .",
    "hence whenever we determine planetary positions , we estimate the length of time necessary for _ wmap _ to rotate through the smallest angle between either radiometer normal vector and any outer planet , and we do not determine positions for that length of time .",
    "this scheme is unduly conservative , since we do not check to see if _ wmap _ is rotating _ toward _ that planet , but it effectively eliminates the bottleneck .",
    "we compute planetary positions using the publicly available axbary software package[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "we use the package function dpleph , based on the ephemeris jpleph.405 . for each outer planet , we ( a ) determine its position relative to the spacecraft in celestial coordinates for julian date @xmath164 , applying spacecraft positions read in from the meta data table ; ( b ) update that position given the actual time of the science frame ; ( c ) convert that position to galactic coordinates using the transformation matrix @xmath165 ; and ( d ) calculate @xmath166 .",
    "note that we do not include the effect of light travel time in our algorithm , as the planets move by less than one sky pixel ( @xmath6 7@xmath87 ) during that period .",
    "if @xmath167 or @xmath168 is @xmath169 ( default 1.5@xmath44 ) , we do not update the temperature map for either pixel .",

    "given current typical cpu speeds ( @xmath1 ghz ) , making a single 20-iteration map takes @xmath1 1 cpu day . to reduce map - making time , we parallelized our c code using the message passing interface ( mpi ) library.[multiblock footnote omitted ] in this instance",
    ", parallelization is particularly easy : each processor is assigned to loop over a subset of tod files , taking the estimated map from the previous iteration and updating it only for that subset . at the end of each iteration",
    ", the updated maps are broadcast to the root node , which sums them ; the summed map is then broadcast back to the processing nodes for use during the next iteration .",
    "we run our parallelized code on the teragrid linux cluster ( www.teragrid.org ) , which links massively parallel supercomputing clusters at nine sites , including ncsa , where we do the bulk of our map - making and where a typical 24-processor , 20-iteration run takes @xmath6 25 cpu minutes .",
    "we note that although we read in the data sequentially during each iteration , because each processing node has its own memory we could in theory keep the time - ordered data in memory after being read once .",
