    "the requirement that detection of a wind should be orientation - dependent is very similar to the case of other structures in qsos , such as the broad - line region ( blr ) or jet ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) . another explanation for bals is an orientation - independent evolution effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the trend of bluer spectra during brighter phases is usually explained by the accretion variation . during the brighter phase ,",
