    "local properties of semiconductor nanostructures can be probed by the scanning gate microscopy @xcite ( sgm ) in which the charge of the atomic force microscope tip perturbs the potential landscape below the surface of the semiconductor within the space occupied by confined charge carriers .",
    "sgm covers both the open systems ( quantum point contacts @xcite , resonant cavities @xcite , quantum rings @xcite ) in which the probe is used to read out the wave function at the fermi level from the conductance perturbations as well as systems that are weakly coupled to the reservoirs , i.e. closed quantum dots @xcite . for the latter , the current flows through the quantum dot only outside the coulomb blockade conditions @xcite , i.e. , when the chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) of @xmath1 confined electrons lies within the transport window defined by the fermi levels of source and drain . in experiments , the tip - induced variation of @xmath2",
    "is determined from the shift of voltages that is necessary for restoration of the current flow @xcite . since the variation depends on the electron density beneath the tip this technique allows for visualization of the charge density @xcite .",
    "the details of the variation of the charge density can be detected only for large quantum dots exceeding the range of tip potential . in large dots and at low electron densities the sgm technique can  at least potentially  resolve single - electron islands within the few - electron quantum dot which are formed as an effect of strong electron - electron correlations with the charge density nucleating to wigner molecules @xcite .",
    "the effort on the extraction of the confined charge density by the scanning gate microscopy concerned mostly quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum dots defined within a quantum wire @xcite .",
    "wigner molecules in 1d quantum dots @xcite are relatively stable against external perturbations due to the fact that the electrons in one dimension can not exchange their positions . in circular 2d",
    "quantum dots at low carrier densities the electron localization acquires a molecular form @xcite only in the inner coordinates of the system and not in the charge density which remains rotationally invariant .",
    "the wigner form of the electron density with separate single - electron islands can observed in the laboratory frame of quantum dots of lower symmetry only for some @xmath1 , for which the classical @xcite charge distribution reproduces the symmetry of the confinement potential @xcite .",
    "so far , the scanning gate microscopy experiments on closed two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots defined within the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) concerned : imaging of the single - electron quantum dot @xcite , mapping the position of floating double dot defined electrostatically @xcite , and determination of the effective tip potential as seen by the confined electrons @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider an extent to which the energy variation induced by the tip can be used for visualization of few - electron charge density in 2d quantum dots .",
    "we investigate the relation between the wigner molecule formation in the laboratory frame and the reaction of the confined density on the potential of the tip .",
    "we perform configuration interaction calculations taking into account both the electron - electron correlation and the reaction of the quantum dot to the tip potential .",
    "the study covers up to four electrons and quantum dots of various symmetries and profiles .",
    "we discuss the adequacy of the perturbative approach for extraction of the electron density @xcite confined in quantum dots and the fidelity of charge images outside the perturbative regime .",
    "we find that the images obtained with repulsive ( attractive ) tip potential tend to overestimate ( underestimate ) the electron localization .",
    "we demonstrate that the confined charge density is best resolved when the classical electron configuration agrees with the symmetry of the confinement potential .",
    "we also identify cases when the confined electron density evades visualization even for weak perturbation introduced by the tip .",
    "in this work we assume a strictly two - dimensional model of confinement which is usually justified by the strong confinement of 2deg in the growth direction ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "the applied multicenter gaussian basis allows for description of any smooth potential with arbitrary or no symmetry @xcite . the few - electron eigenproblem is solved with the configuration interaction approach using the eigenstates of operator ( [ 1h ] ) for construction of the basis .",

    "the maps of the chemical potential @xmath26 can be gathered by re - tuning the conditions for the current flow ( i.e. lifting of the coulomb blockade ) with varied backgate potential or bias . since @xmath27",
    ", the energy maps as functions of the tip position can be deduced for any @xmath1 .",
    "simulation of the confined charge density mapping by the sgm technique is performed in the following sequence .",
    "we first calculate the energy of @xmath28electron system as a function of the tip position .",
    "the charge density extracted from the energy map @xmath29 is obtained under the assumption that the action of the tip is perturbative @xcite @xmath30 equation ( [ feft ] ) is a convolution of the tip potential and the confined charge density .",
    "the charge density can be extracted from the energy dependence of the tip position using the fourier transform technique @xcite . alternatively eq .",
    "( [ feft ] ) can be treated as the fredholm - type integral equation for @xmath29 .",
    "we apply the nystrm approach replacing the integral by a quadrature ( rectangle rule ) . upon replacement",
    "we obtain a linear system of equations for the charge density in the mesh points used for the quadrature . in the following",
    "we compare the charge density deduced in this way ( @xmath29 ) with the exact one ( @xmath31 ) that is calculated from the few - electron wave function @xmath32 for comparison we calculate also the charge density @xmath33 assuming that the tip potential is point - like @xmath34 .",
    "then , eq . ( [ feft ] ) reduces to @xmath35 normalized charge density @xmath33 derived from this formula is simply proportional to the energy variation .",
    "the original potential of the charged tip is of the coulomb form .",
    "as the tip approaches the 2deg its charge density reacts by deformation which results in the screening of the tip potential .",
    "previous schrdinger - poisson calculations @xcite for the reaction of the 2deg to the tip indicated that the effective ( i.e. screened ) tip potential is close to the lorentz form @xmath36 where the width of the tip @xmath37 turns out to be of the order of the tip ",
    "2deg distance @xcite independent of the charge at the tip and the density of 2deg , which only influence the strength of the perturbation @xmath38 and not its range .",
    "the lorentz form of the effective tip potential for sgm measurements on 2deg was also found in experimental studies of 2d quantum dots @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the bulk of this work we use mainly the lorentz model potential of the tip and assume @xmath39 nm , which seems the smallest reasonable value of the potential width .",
    "for comparison we also consider the reaction of the confined system to the long - range coulomb potential @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the tip potential , and @xmath42  the position of the tip above the 2deg plane .",
    "an ample discussion of potentials of electrostatic quantum dots defined within 2deg was given in ref .",
    "the calculations @xcite indicated that depending on the geometry of the device one can obtain both parabolic and quantum well profiles .",
    "the latter can only be realized for large dots @xcite of the linear extent of the order of a few hundred nm , i.e. the ones which are studied in the present work . since our purpose is to determine the relation between the @xmath28dependent classical electron distribution and the quantum dot geometry we consider a number of potentials : parabolic @xmath43 of circular @xmath44 and elliptic @xmath45 symmetry , as well as non - parabolic dots modeled by formula @xmath46 which produces a well - like potential with a flat bottom of a nearly rectangular shape of dimensions @xmath47 .",

    "<S> we perform a numerical simulation of mapping of charge confined in quantum dots by the scanning probe technique . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the few - electron schrdinger equation with the exact diagonalization approach and evaluate the energy maps in function of the probe position . </S>",
    "<S> next , from the energy maps we try to reproduce the charge density distribution using an integral equation given by the perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the reproduced density maps are confronted with the original ones . </S>",
    "<S> the present study covers two - dimensional quantum dots of various geometries and profiles with the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum dot as a limit case . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on large quantum dots for which strong electron - electron correlations appear . for circular dots </S>",
    "<S> the correlations lead to formation of wigner molecules that in the presence of the tip appear in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed rotationally - symmetric charge density is surprisingly well reproduced by the mapping . </S>",
    "<S> we find in general that the size of the confined droplet as well as the spatial extent of the charge density maxima is underestimated for repulsive tip potential and overestimated for the attractive tip . in lower - symmetry quantum dots the wigner molecules with single - electron islands nucleate for some electron numbers even in the absence of the tip . </S>",
    "<S> these charge densities are well resolved by the mapping . </S>",
    "<S> the single - electron islands appear in the laboratory frame provided that classical point charge density distribution is unique , in the 1d limit of confinement in particular . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for electron systems which possess a few equivalent classical configurations the repulsive probe switches between the configurations . in consequence </S>",
    "<S> the charge density evades mapping by the repulsive probe . </S>"
