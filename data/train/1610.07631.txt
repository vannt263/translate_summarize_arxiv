    "depinning phenomena and dynamic phases of collective transport through quenched disorder @xcite arise in a wide range of condensed matter systems including flux lines in superconductors @xcite , sliding charge density waves @xcite , moving electron crystals @xcite , magnetic skyrmions @xcite , and driven pattern forming systems such as electronic states with competing interactions @xcite . in materials science systems",
    "such dynamics is relevant to sliding friction @xcite , dislocation motion @xcite , yielding transitions @xcite , and models of fault lines and earthquakes @xcite . in soft matter ,",
    "similar dynamics occurs in the depinning of contact lines @xcite , driven colloidal motion on disordered substrates @xcite , or sliding of incommensurate colloidal structures on ordered substrates @xcite .",
    "typically , these systems are in the pinned state at small external drives , and as the drive increases , a transition to a moving state occurs at a specific critical value of the external force @xcite . at higher drives , distinct types of sliding motions",
    "can appear along with transitions between different dynamic states that can be deduced from features in the velocity - force curves .",
    "the flow can be plastic or disordered @xcite , with the particles moving through riverlike channels@xcite , or elastic , where the particles maintain the same neighbors while moving @xcite .",
    "transitions from disordered to more ordered or coherent flow can occur @xcite , such as from plastic flow to a moving smectic state @xcite .",
    "such transitions are associated with changes in the moving structure morphologies , the density of topological defects @xcite , and the noise fluctuations @xcite .    in all of the systems mentioned above , an external driving force produces a nonequilibrium condition . other types of nonequilibrium systems that involve no external driving force include self - propelled or active matter systems . these may be biological systems , such as swimming bacteria , or artificial swimmers , such as self - propelled colloidal systems , each of which can exhibit distinct nonequilibrium phases as a function of the activity or particle density @xcite . many types of active matter systems can be effectively modeled as a collection of sterically interacting disks undergoing driven brownian diffusion @xcite or run and tumble dynamics @xcite .",
    "these disks can form uniform liquid states as well as phase separated states in which dense disk clusters are separated by a low density disk gas .",
    "an open question is whether such systems would exhibit depinning transitions and different types of sliding states if an external drive were applied when the disks are coupled to a random substrate , as the driven dynamics of particles interacting with obstacles generally are distinct from those of particles on random pinning substrates .",
    "previous studies of active matter systems driven through obstacle arrays showed that the average drift mobility varies non - monotonically with increasing activity , dropping when the system forms a phase - separated clump state @xcite .",
    "other studies of active matter involving swarming or vicsek flocking models moving over disordered substrates in the absence of an external drive showed that there can be an optimal noise at which flocking occurs @xcite as well as transitions from flocking to non - flocking behavior @xcite .    here",
    "we use large scale gpu - based computer simulations to characterize the different states of run and tumble disks driven over a random pinning substrate , and show that a rich variety of distinct dynamical phases are possible that can be identified by the morphologies of the moving structures as well as by features in bulk transport properties . despite the additional complexity introduced by the self - propulsion",
    ", we find several generic features in the dynamic phase diagrams that are similar to those observed for non - active driven systems such as superconducting vortex lattices , including a disorder to order transition at higher drives . in the limit of no quenched disorder",
    ", we find a cluster or phase - separated state , while in the presence of strong quenched disorder , the system forms a uniform pinned liquid state which undergoes plastic depinning as the drive is increased , followed at higher drives by a transition to a stripe state coexisting with the pinned liquid state . at even higher drives",
    ", there is a transition to a more fully phase separated state .",
    "we also find strong differences in the dynamic phases for pinning arrays compared to those observed in obstacle arrays , where only a limited number of dynamic phases occur .",

    "we set @xmath20 to ensure that at most one disk can be pinned by a given pinning site .",
    "we apply a uniform external drive @xmath21 on each disk in the @xmath22-direction and measure the resulting average drift velocity per disk in the direction of the drive @xmath23 to produce velocity - force curves .",
    "the disk dynamics is obtained by integrating the following overdamped equation of motion : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the drag coefficient .",
