    "about a quarter of a century ago , a peculiar type of slow relaxation was discovered theoretically in researches of glassy systems @xcite .",
    "this relaxation behavior is characterized by two different time scales , both of which diverge at a temperature .",
    "an illustrative example exhibiting such a behavior is the spherical @xmath0-spin glass model @xcite .",
    "the normalized time - correlation function @xmath2 of total magnetization in this model turned out to satisfy exactly the so - called mode - coupling equation , which is written as @xmath3 for the case @xmath4 . here",
    ", the initial condition is given by @xmath5 , and the parameter @xmath6 is proportional to the square of the inverse temperature . since this equation is derived under an assumption that the system possesses the stationarity , ( [ mct ] ) is valid only in a regime @xmath7 , where @xmath8 will be given later .",
    "a remarkable feature of ( [ mct ] ) is the existence of nonlinear memory .",
    "one can regard ( [ mct ] ) as one of the simplest equations that characterize a universality class consisting of models with nonlinear memory .",
    "indeed , some qualitatively new features in glassy systems have been uncovered by studying ( [ mct ] ) and its extended forms .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite as a review . )",
    "in particular , two divergent time scales were found just below the transition point @xmath9 , and the precise values of the exponents characterizing the divergences were determined .",
    "furthermore , extensive studies have been attempted so as to construct the solution in a systematic manner .",
    "on the basis of past achievements , in the present paper , we propose a perturbation method for analyzing ( [ mct ] ) , which might shed new light on the nature near the mode coupling transition .",
    "we shall address the question we study in this paper .",
    "let @xmath10 be the value of @xmath11 .",
    "we substitute @xmath12 into ( [ mct ] ) and take the limit @xmath13 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath14 where we have used the relation @xmath15 . from the graph @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 , we find that the non - trivial solution ( @xmath18 ) appears when @xmath19 . this transition is called the mode - coupling transition . note that @xmath20 when @xmath21 . below we express this value of @xmath10 as @xmath22 .",
    "we then introduce a small positive parameter @xmath23 by setting @xmath24 , and we denote the solution of ( [ mct ] ) by @xmath25 . in this paper , we formulate a perturbation theory for ( [ mct ] ) . as a result , we obtain an asymptotic form of @xmath25 in the small @xmath23 limit .    more concretely , for a given small positive @xmath23 ,",
    "we want to express @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath26-independent functions . for readers reference , in figure [ fig4 ] ( left )",
    ", we display the numerical solution @xmath25 with @xmath27 . here , when solving ( [ mct ] ) , we used the algorithm proposed in ref . @xcite . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "( right ) , we also display the @xmath26-dependence of the @xmath1-relaxation time @xmath28 which is defined by @xmath29 .",
    "we want to calculate @xmath28 based on our theory .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      at the end of this section , we make two remarks .",
    "first , as a demonstration of our result , we study the @xmath1-relaxation time @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be @xmath31 .",
    "then , from the expression of the solution ( [ sol : rep : f ] ) , @xmath28 is estimated as @xmath32 . by using the value @xmath33 obtained from numerical integration of ( [ def_a ] )",
    ", we arrive at the theoretical prediction @xmath34 in figure [ fig4 ] ( right ) , we display the result of numerical simulations of ( [ mct ] ) with @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the numerical data are perfectly placed on the theoretical result ( [ taualpha ] ) .",
    "this is an evidence that the expression ( [ final ] ) is correct .",
    "the second remark is on the systematic formulation . in principle , higher order terms such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 can also be calculated in a manner similar to that described in sections [ calc ] and [ solv : sec ] .",
    "such a perturbation theory with using a solvability condition has been employed in many problems @xcite .",
    "we have formulated a systematic perturbation theory for ( [ mct ] ) . due to the dilatational symmetry ( [ l_zero ] )",
    ", an arbitrary constant @xmath39 appears in the unperturbed solution @xmath40 .",
    "then , the value of @xmath39 is determined by the solvability condition ( [ solv ] ) associated with the linear equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for the perturbative correction @xmath41 .",
    "the advantage of our systematic perturbation is in a possibility of developing new and important directions .",
    "concretely , following the three problems will be studied soon .",
    "the first problem is to derive the fluctuation intensity of @xmath42 just below the mode - coupling transition point for the spherical @xmath0-spin glass , where @xmath43 is a real spin variable that satisfies the spherical constraint @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 with @xmath46 in the stationary regime . in a straightforward approach",
    ", one may study an effective potential for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "indeed , by employing a diagrammatic expansion with neglecting vertex corrections , the singular behavior of the effective potential was evaluated @xcite .",
    "then , since the minimum of the potential corresponds to the solution of ( [ mct ] ) , the existence of the dilatational symmetry yields the goldstone mode which carries a divergent part of fluctuations in the late stage .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath39 in our expression is treated as a fluctuating quantity , and it is identified with the goldstone mode .",
    "( a related description of fluctuations near another type of bifurcation points can be seen in refs .",
    "the analysis along this line will shed a new light to the understanding of fluctuations near mode - coupling transition points .    as an alternative approach to the description of fluctuations near the mode - coupling transition , response properties against an auxiliary external field conjugated to @xmath48 @xcite and against a one - body potential field @xcite were investigated .",
    "their studies successfully derived the scaling form of a singular part of the fluctuation intensity of @xmath48 based on an idea that such response functions are related to the fluctuation intensity .",
    "the extension of our work so as to describe the responses may provide a more quantitative result than the scaling form .",
    "such an extension is related to a study of dynamical behavior in the aging regime , because its behavior is described by a coupled equation of the time correlation function @xmath49 and the response function @xmath50 , which are functions of two times @xcite .",
    "in addition to a complicated structure of the equation , the dilatational symmetry is replaced with the time reparameterization symmetry .",
    "since the symmetry is much wider than the dilatational symmetry , several new features may appear in the analysis .",
    "@xcite as a review for the argument on the basis of the time reparameterization symmetry .",
    "the third problem is to analyze a rather wide class of systems with nonlinear memory .",
    "the qualitative change of the solution @xmath10 of ( [ f : eq ] ) is the same type as that observed in an elementary saddle - node bifurcation @xcite . despite this similarity ,",
    "the dynamical behavior near the saddle - node bifurcation is much simpler than that of ( [ mct ] ) owing to the lack of nonlinear memory .",
    "note that an edge deletion process of @xmath51-core percolation in a random graph is precisely described by a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite and it has been pointed out that @xmath51-core percolation problems are related to jamming transitions @xcite . since nonlinear memory effects might appear in jamming transitions , it is important to study a mixed type of dynamical systems which connect the elementary saddle - node bifurcation with the mode - coupling transition .",
    "the calculation presented in this paper may be useful in the analysis of such models .    by studying these problems",
    ", we will have deeper understanding of slow relaxation with nonlinear memory .",
    "we also hope that this paper provokes mathematical studies of the simplest mode - coupling equation ( [ mct ] ) .",

    "we next combine the second line of ( [ i2 ] ) with @xmath85 and return it to the original form . as the result , we obtain @xmath88 where higher order terms are ignored . with the aid of ( [ def_a ] ) ,",
    "we rewrite the first line of ( [ fsecond ] ) as @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , from an estimation @xmath90 which is valid in the limit @xmath74 , the second line of ( [ fsecond ] ) turns out to be of @xmath91 . these results lead to ( [ f_eporder ] ) .",
    "we also find that the higher order terms we have neglected in ( [ fsecond ] ) are of @xmath92 by an estimation similar to ( [ est ] ) .",
