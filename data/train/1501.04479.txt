    "order is one of the central properties to characterize complexly structured systems of any dimensionality .",
    "there is certainly no doubt that periodic systems hold highest order and thus periodicity   meaning the invariance in translation for integer multiples of a set of lattice vectors   are examined thoroughly for centuries providing nowadays a deep theoretical understanding of waves in periodic media .",
    "consequently , universal theories such as the floquet - bloch theorem were introduced where the model of band structures , for instance , is one prominent achievement recovered in numerous disciplines .",
    "one of the best established model transfers from electron - wave propagation in solids is covered by the floquet - bloch theorem to the field of photonic lattices with light ( or electro - magnetic waves in general ) as the propagating wave in a periodically modulated refractive index material @xcite .",
    "the existence of band gaps where propagation is forbidden as , per definition , no eigenstates exist within these gaps is closely connected to a band - structure system .",
    "quasi - periodic structures obviously are of less order than periodic structures as they lack in short - range order @xcite . however , the spectra of both , periodic and quasi - periodic structures only present discrete contributions and are distinguishable by their rotation symmetry at the utmost which is limited to 2- , 3- , 4- , or 6-fold for periodic lattices . for quasi - periodic structures",
    "even higher rotation symmetry can emerge and , more interestingly , band - structure properties can be assigned to these systems as well , de facto offering complete band gaps @xcite .    numerous experimental techniques to achieve refractive index modulations such as direct laser writing @xcite and photo lithography techniques @xcite",
    "were suggested during the last decades @xcite . in photorefractive media , for instance",
    ", the refractive index is usually modulated by illumination with structured light @xcite .",
    "in particular , optical induction of elongated two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic structures can be achieved using so - called nondiffracting beams @xcite where the intensity is modulated transversely while being constant in the direction of propagation @xcite .",
    "this technique is highly dynamic as the refractive index modulation achieved with low to moderate intensities is reversible and additionally introduces a nonlinear response allowing for the realization of discrete soliton formations in periodic photonic structures @xcite .",
    "corresponding to the induction of periodic photonic lattices , the use of quasi - periodic nondiffracting writing beams such as a 5-fold penrose intensity - configuration allows for the optical generation of according photonic quasi - crystals @xcite .",
    "in general , nondiffracting beams cover an enormous variety of intensity modulations , ranging with decreasing order from periodic @xcite to quasi - periodic @xcite to random structures @xcite . yet , discrete structures without rotation symmetry are barely feasible with a single - beam induction configuration .",
    "we thus presented recently that optical induction techniques can be extended to resemble any aperiodic structure by sets of zero - order bessel beams as waveguide formation entities @xcite . applying this incremental induction technique @xcite , we realized full aperiodic so - called vogel lattices that are prominent examples for structures inspired by nature as similar arrangements can be found by plant growth following golden - angle phyllotaxis @xcite .",
    "vogel spirals do not show any periodicity in most cases , though they are created deterministically as a construction rule assembles the structure iteratively up to an arbitrary quantity of elements .",
    "of course , there are uncountable examples of deterministic aperiodic structures @xcite holding different degrees of order @xcite . yet , in terms of order",
    "the lebesgue s decomposition theorem was suggested to categorize structures along their spectral appearance @xcite .",
    "spectra of aperiodic structures with highest order including fibonacci patterns @xcite show only discrete contributions while low - order structures such as rudin - shapiro patterns feature continuous quasi - white - noise spectra @xcite .",
    "accordingly , structures with intermediate order have both , singular and continuous spectral properties .",
    "the most famous structure among them certainly arises from the thue - morse sequence @xcite .",
    "the question of how an altering degree of order influences wave ( or light ) propagation remains untouched within this categorization scheme . as localization in the sense of reduced light transport becomes more significant in disordered photonic systems @xcite , the occurrence of localized modes due to a deterministic aperiodicity is ascribed to flat bands along with band gaps that unclose with decreased order @xcite . in consequence , finding signatures of localization already in singular - spectral structures would directly refer to an expected reduced degree of order in comparison to periodic lattices with likewise singular spectra .    in this contribution",
    ", we examine waveguide patterns of pure - point spectra by exploring light localization effects @xcite in optically induced refractive index fibonacci structures .",
    "we benefit from a highly dynamic and reversible induction scheme at realizing largely elongated photonic structures that offer excellent interaction distances . in fibonacci arrangements ,",
    "diverse local configurations of lattice sites exist @xcite .",
    "hence , we consider an output average for waveguide excitation at different input positions . by comparing our results with a periodic photonic lattice configuration where discrete diffraction with a high rate of transport is expected to be found @xcite ,",
    "we underline that order is significantly diminished already in aperiodic structures with pure - point spectra , disabling light transport and causing power - law weighted localization @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows .",
    "first , we present our approach of applying one - dimensional fibonacci words to create 2d lattices with fibonacci tiling .",
    "after we have described the applied experimental techniques and specific parameters that we used for the optical induction , we present our results of single - waveguide excitation and compare these experimental data with numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we cross - check our results against light propagation events in a regular lattice before a conclusion is drawn in the last section .",
    "[ sec : fiblattice ] our approach to design an aperiodic fibonacci pattern is to vary the distances of adjacent waveguides encoded as fibonacci words @xcite .",

    "thus , in addition to the nomenclature aperiodic , a classification of the presented spectrum as singular or pure - point is appropriate , as well @xcite .    after we have determined the waveguide positioning scheme resembling a 2d fibonacci arrangement , we apply the incoherent - bessel beam induction method to preserve the nondiffracting character of the effective intensity during the writing process .",
    "this method implies to write every single waveguide with an appropriate nondiffracting bessel beam of zeroth order and structural size @xmath25 . determining the structural size @xmath25 of the bessel beam intensity settles the waveguide diameter which scales proportionally with @xmath25 . in our considerations ,",

    "[ fig : compareperiodfib](a ) where particular arrangements promote beam widths that are even larger than for the periodic case , especially around @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast , configurations holding effective beam widths considerably below the mean value naturally result from most localized modes . to underline the diversity of localized modes occurring",
    ", we depict in figures [ fig : compareperiodfib](d , e ) conditions of maximal and minimal @xmath54 , together confirming the relevance of the local waveguide arrangement conditions on light transport .    obviously , transverse light transport is slowed down in average due to aperiodic conditions accounting for localized modes whose appearance indirectly indicate the presence of band gaps  @xcite .",
    "periodic structures , in contrast , bring forward extended propagation modes as more light is carried away from the input position due to discrete diffraction .",
    "to conclude , we have observed light localization in optically induced two - dimensional fibonacci photonic lattices that arises from the aperiodic property of the waveguide arrangement . by experimentally and numerically analyzing linear propagation characteristics for various incident positions , we observed enhanced localization in fibonacci photonic lattices compared with discrete - diffraction driven light transport in equivalent periodic realizations .",
    "we identify this localization with the occurrence of highly localized modes due to aperiodic structural conditions with diminished order , indirectly indicating the existence of band gaps .    a very good agreement between experimental and numerical results allowed to additionally analyze the development during propagation of a wave package sent to corresponding lattices .",
    "these numerical results consolidated our experimental observations and , moreover , gave deeper insights into propagation dynamics .",
    "we further found that selecting the input position in such a deterministic aperiodic structure is highly crucial to the beam broadening during propagation .",
    "both , broader and smaller effective beam widths could be found among different scenarios compared to propagation in periodic waveguide arrangements .",
    "evidently , the shape of excited localized modes and thus the strength of localization are local rather than global properties in these kind of structures that have been subject of our investigations .",
    "we are convinced that our results can be generalized to other kinds of aperiodic refractive index lattices , using the presented ideas and methods .",
