    "although spin glasses@xcite have been studied for more than two decades , finite - dimensional spin glasses are still far from being well understood .",
    "this is true also in @xmath4 dimensions , where no stable spin - glass phase@xcite exists at @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the transition temperature , @xmath6 , is zero can be seen by studying domain walls between ground states induced by changing the boundary conditions . for a system of size @xmath1 , if the domain wall is forced to run in the @xmath7-direction , the mean domain - wall energy scales like @xmath8 in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath9 is the _",
    "stiffness exponent_. if @xmath10 , as in two - dimensional spin glasses ,",
    "no stable phase can exist at finite temperature .",
    "recently@xcite slightly different values of the stiffness exponent have been found for gaussian distribution of the bonds for different choices of the boundary conditions . here , by applying the aspect - ratio method@xcite",
    ", we show that this difference is due to corrections to scaling which persisted , at least for one set of boundary conditions , even for the quite large system sizes used in ref .  .",
    "the results presented here are consistent with @xmath3 for all boundary conditions .",
    "this agrees with the result found in ref .   where periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions for smaller systems than investigated here , indicating a high degree of universality for the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "apart from using larger systems and different boundary conditions , we go in another respect beyond the previous work , because aspect ratios , @xmath11 , less than unity are studied here .",
    "this enables us to verify the proposed scaling behavior in the region @xmath12 , where the finite - size scaling depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "the model we study consists of @xmath13  ising spins @xmath14 on a square lattice with the hamiltonian @xmath15 where the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors @xmath16 and the @xmath17 are quenched random variables . here , we consider two kinds of disorder distributions :    1 .",
    "gaussian with zero mean and variance unity , 2 .",
    "bimodal , i.e.  @xmath18 with equal probability .    to study whether an ordered phase is stable at finite temperatures ,",
    "the following procedure is usually applied @xcite .",
    "first a ground state of the system is calculated , having energy @xmath19 .",
    "then the system is perturbed to introduce a domain wall and the new ground state energy , @xmath20 is evaluated . for each sample ,",
    "the domain - wall energy is given by @xmath21 .",
    "here , we apply free boundary conditions ( bc ) in the @xmath7-direction . to study the scaling behavior of the domain - wall energy , we consider two means to introduce domain walls :    1 .   `` p - ap '' : first a ground state with periodic bc in the @xmath22-direction",
    "is calculated .",
    "then the system is perturbed by introducing antiperiodic bc in that directions , e.g.  by reversing one line of bonds parallel to the @xmath7-direction .",
    "`` f - dw '' ( called `` f - af '' in ref .  ): first a ground state with free bc in the @xmath22-direction is calculated . for the perturbed system , we then add extra bonds which wrap around the system in the @xmath22-direction , and have a sign and strength such that they force the spins they connect to have the opposite relative orientation to that which they had in the original ground state .    in both cases , @xmath23 denotes the size of the edge along which the boundary conditions are changed to induce a domain wall ( i.e.  the size in the @xmath7-direction ) . the scaling behavior @xmath24 has been predicted@xcite , with the following limiting forms : @xmath25 we shall verfiy that the data does follow this scaling form very well .",
    "in greater than two dimensions , or in the presence of a magnetic field , the exact calculation of spin - glass ground states belongs to the class of np - hard problems@xcite .",
    "this means that only algorithms with exponentially increasing running times are known .",
    "however , for the special case of a planar system without magnetic field , e.g. a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions in at most one direction , there are efficient polynomial - time `` matching '' algorithms@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to represent each realization of the disorder by its frustrated plaquettes@xcite .",
    "pairs of frustrated plaquettes are connected by paths in the lattice and the weight of a path is defined by the sum of the absolute values of the coupling constants which are crossed by the path .",
    "a ground state corresponds to the set of paths with minimum total weight , such that each frustrated plaquette is connected to exactly one other frustrated plaquette .",
    "this is called a minimum - weight perfect matching .",
    "the bonds which are crossed by paths connecting the frustrated plaquettes are unsatisfied in the ground state , and all other bonds are satisfied .    for the calculation of the minimum - weight perfect matching ,",
    "efficient polynomial - time algorithms are available@xcite .",
    "recently , an implementation has been presented@xcite , where ground - state energies of large systems of size @xmath26 were calculated . here , an algorithm from the leda library@xcite has been applied , which limits the system sizes due to the restricted size of the main memory of the computers which we used .",
    "furthermore , each system border with a free boundary decreases the running time relative to a boundary with pbc .",
    "the reason is that frustrated plaquettes near a free boundary may be connected even when they are far apart from each other , increasing the number of possible connections . on the other hand , full pcb",
    "can not be realized with the matching algorithm .",
    "hence , we have limited our system sizes to @xmath27 for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "for gaussian interactions we have considered systems with p - ap and f - dw boundary conditions with aspect ratios @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "we took system sizes @xmath33 to @xmath34 for @xmath31 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 to @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the p - ap case , the exponent @xmath9 is more or less independent of the system size .",
    "by contrast , for the f - dw case a significant increase with system size is observed , with the value seeming to converge near the value of the p - ap case for large @xmath43 .",
    "this @xmath43-dependence explains why in previous work@xcite ( @xmath48 ) a difference between p - ap and f - dw has been found .",
    "the result found here is compatible with the exponents being equal for both cases .",
    "we quote @xmath3 , which is a conservative estimate including all values of @xmath9 found for the p - ap case .",
    "this is compatible with the result of @xmath49 obtained@xcite for systems with full periodic bc .",
    "part of the data in ref",
    ".   corresponds to the f - dw case with pbc in the @xmath7-direction , and we show this here in the final column in table  [ theta_vals ] , where @xmath50 was used . for this case",
    "an even stronger dependence of the effective exponent on @xmath43 is observed , indicating that corrections to scaling are even larger in this case .",
    "we suggest that this is because the pbc forces the domain wall to take at the top and bottom edges the same positions along the @xmath22-axis , thereby raising its typical energy . in ref .",
    "it was shown that @xmath51 ( called @xmath52 in ref .  )",

    "note that the statistics for both p - ap and f - dw cases are comparable , while the statistics for @xmath32 are worse than for the other values due to the smaller number of samples . from fig .",
    "[ figscalevarr ] we see that , for small values of @xmath43 , the f - dw case scales less well than the p - ap case .",
    "this may explain , why , for f - dw , the stiffness exponent obtained for small aspect - ratios differs significantly from the @xmath62 limit .",
    "the fact that f - dw scales less well than p - ap is probably due to the larger influence of the system boundaries induced by the free bc . as a result ,",

    "a saturation of the domain - wall energy has been observed for @xmath48 when @xmath67 , i.e.  a fundamentally different result from the gaussian case .",
    "this raises the question of whether the aspect - ratio approach is also able to make those results consistent .    as an example , in fig .",
    "[ figpmf0_m4stiff ] the domain - wall energy is plotted for @xmath65 as a function of @xmath64 .",

    "let @xmath70 be the probability to find a _",

    ", the probability to find a non - zero domain - wall energy is so small that for a reasonable number of samples @xmath71 will be exactly zero .",
    "this is what we have indeed found for @xmath73 and @xmath32 .",
    "it means that for the bimodal model the aspect - ratio approach can not be applied .",
    "this is in contrast to the gaussian case , where aspect ratio scaling works better and better with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "we have studied the scaling behavior of the energy of domain walls in two - dimensional spin glasses obtained by changing the boundary conditions at @xmath0 . for the numerical calculations ,",

    "our main results are :    1 .",
    "the value of the stiffness exponent for gaussian distribution of the bonds in @xmath4 seems to be independent of the choice of the boundary conditions and the way the domain walls are introduced .",
    "we give a final value of @xmath3 .",
    "the scaling behavior predicted by the aspect - ratio approach applies very well for the gaussian distribution of the bonds , again indicating that the value of @xmath9 is independent of the boundary conditions .",
