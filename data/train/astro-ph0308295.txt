    "in the last decade , observational studies on primeval galaxies has made great progress .",
    "for example , deep surveys in the optical ( williams et al . 1996 ) , near - infrared ( maihara et al . 2001 ) and mid - infrared ( taniguchi et al .",
    "1997 ) wavelengths have revealed early evolution of galaxies .    since galaxies in the earliest phase consist mostly of gas , knowledge on interstellar medium in forming galaxies is valuable for understanding galaxy formation process .",
    "molecular line observation has been a powerful tool in diagnosing the physical conditions in local star - forming regions ( e.g. , dyson & williams 1997 ) .",
    "recently , molecular line emission has also been found to emanate from high - redshift galaxies and the number of detected sources has been increasing rapidly ( e.g. , ohta et al . 1996 ; omont et al . 1996 ; combes 1999 ) . among theoretical studies , spaans & silk ( 1997 ) investigated co line emission from protogalaxies",
    ". however , the detection of metal lines depends on the degree of metal enrichment and thus preceeding star formation is required .",
    "can we detect molecular lines in primordial pristine gas clouds ?",
    "the possibility of detecting h@xmath0 line emission from forming galaxies was discussed as early as the firm establishment of the big - bang cosmology ( saslaw & zipoy 1967 ) .",
    "other pioneering work includes that by izotov & kolesnik ( 1984 ) and shchekinov & ntl ( 1985 ) , which treats the h@xmath0 emission from proto - clusters of galaxies , i.e , the so - called `` zeldovich pancakes '' .",
    "more recently , ciardi & ferrara ( 2001 ) investigated the h@xmath0 emission from the super - shells created in the intergalactic medium as a result of multiple sn explosions in popiii objects .",
    "they concluded that about 10 per cent of the sn mechanical energy is carried away by the h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) rovibrational line .",
    "stimulated by the recent theoretical understanding of the first star - forming regions ( e.g. , omukai & nishi 1998 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; omukai & palla 2001 , 2003 ) , research has been vigorously carried out on the radiation from individual star - forming cores .",
    "flower & pineau des forts ( 2001 ) calculated h@xmath0 emission from a j - type shock expected to appear in the prestellar collapse .",
    "kamaya & silk ( 2002 ) studied the h@xmath0 emission from a collapsing prestellar core using a simplified model , and pointed out that the 0 - 0s(3 ) line is the strongest during the prestellar collapse phase .",
    "ripamonti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) arrived at similar conclusions by a more refined calculation .",
    "shibai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied the detectability of h@xmath0 absorption lines in high - redshift objects .",
    "all these studies , however , suggest that the prospect for direct detection of h@xmath0 emission from forming galaxies is rather dim , though not rejected , even with next generation facilities .    on the other hand , ly@xmath2 emitting galaxies in high - redshifts",
    "have been observed ( e.g. , hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; steidel et al . 2000 ; kodaira et al .",
    "stimulated by these findings , some authors have investigated the ly@xmath2 cooling radiation from protogalaxies by semi - analytical modeling ( haiman , spaans , & quataert 2000 ) or by numerical simulations ( fardal et al .",
    "they concluded that the greater part of the gravitational energy is indeed emitted by the h ly@xmath2 line emission . in their model , however , h@xmath0-line cooling is not included , and the temperature in protogalaxies thus remains above @xmath8 k , below which atomic cooling is strongly suppressed .",
    "although this is a fair assumption for the massive objects that they considered ( see  3 below ) , for smaller objects with total mass @xmath9 , sufficient h@xmath0 can be formed as a result of enhanced ionization degree by virialization shock and its delayed non - equilibrium recombination ( shapiro & kang 1986 ; susa et al .",
    "1998 ; oh & haiman 2002 ) . by this mechanism",
    ", the temperature drops further below @xmath8 k due to h@xmath0 line cooling .",
    "therefore , the greater part of gravitational energy liberated by contraction will be available for the h@xmath0 cooling radiation . in this paper",
    ", we study the h@xmath0 cooling radiation from those forming galaxies and discuss the prospect for observing such sources .",
    "our result is quite encouraging , suggesting that h@xmath0 emission is indeed observable by the future infrared satellite mission @xmath10 from sources as high as @xmath11 .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows : in  2 , the method of calculation is described . in  3 ,",
    "the prediction for the h@xmath0 emission from forming galaxies and its observability is discussed .",
    "finally in  4 , a brief summary and discussions are presented . throughout the paper , we adopt a @xmath12cdm cosmology in accordance with the wmap data ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we describe our model for evaluating h@xmath0 line emission .",
    "we use a simplified evolution model where a forming protogalaxy is treated as a uniform cloud .    as the initial state , we take an instance of virialization .",
    "we use the analytic formula for the density at virialization @xmath14 where @xmath15 which has been found to provide a good description of the numerical results ( bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "the critical density at @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the present - day critical density .",
    "the radius and temperature of objects of total mass @xmath19 in this instance are @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "we first describe the dissipationless case and later describe the prescription for the dissipation of kinetic energy . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the dark matter density is assumed to be constant after the virialization .",
    "the evolution of gas density is computed by solving the virial equation for a spherical object @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the mass enclosed within a spherical shell of radius @xmath25 .",
    "the thermal evolution is computed by solving the energy equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the specific thermal energy @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the radiative and chemical cooling rates per unit mass , respectively .",
    "the radiative cooling rate includes h@xmath0 line emission , hd line emission , atomic emission by h and he , and compton cooling .",
    "the h@xmath0 line cooling is treated as in omukai ( 2001 ) , where the effect of cmb is taken into account and the ortho - para ratio of 3:1 is assumed .",
    "for the hd cooling , the cooling function by galli & palla ( 1998 ) is used .",
    "the effect of cmb for hd cooling is treated approximately by replacing the cooling rate by hd line @xmath31 by @xmath32 ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "the atomic emission includes collisional excitation cooling , recombination cooling , and bremsstrahlung of h and he .",
    "the coefficients given by anninos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are used .",
    "the above formulation neglects dissipation of kinetic energy of contracting gas ; after the initial thermal energy is carried away by radiation , essentially all the gravitational energy liberated by contraction contributes to accelerating the gas infall .",
    "if the gas , however , settles into a kepler rotation disk , the kinetic energy is reduced by a factor of 2 compared to the free - falling sphere with the same radius , i.e. half of the kinetic energy must be dissipated away . such dissipation may proceed through the thermalization of kinetic energy by turbulent motion induced by the non - spherical nature of the collapse . to mimic this effect",
    ", we add a dissipation term in equations of motion and of energy ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the drag and heating terms due to dissipation of kinetic energy .",
    "to compute these quantities , we assume that a fraction @xmath37 of kinetic energy is thermalized during the collapse .",
    "specifically , we first evaluate at each timestep the increment of kinetic energy in the dissipationless case @xmath38 using equations ( [ eqmotionf0 ] ) and ( [ eqenergyf0 ] ) .",
    "we then solve equations ( [ eqmotionf025 ] ) and ( [ eqenergyf025 ] ) assuming that @xmath39 is injected as heat and the actual increment of kinetic energy is @xmath40 .",
    "in reality , the value of @xmath37 is likely to lie between @xmath41 ( for the kepler rotating disk ) and @xmath42 ( for the spherical collapse ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath43 as our fiducial value , while we also study the dissipationless case ( @xmath44 ) for comparison .",
    "the freeze - out values of chemical abundances are used for the initial abundances for the computation : @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( galli & palla 1998 ) . the chemical reactions between h , and he compounds are solved following omukai ( 2000 ; reactions 1 - 22 ) , with hd - bearing reactions of d3 , d4 , d8,and d10 in galli & palla ( 1998 ) added .",
    "we find , however , that hd cooling is not important in all cases we studied .",
    "the cloud collapse is followed from the virialization until either the local hubble time @xmath47\\ ] ] elapses or the radius reaches the rotation barrier @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass fraction of gas .",
    "we adopt a median value 0.05 for the dimensionless spin parameter at turn - around @xmath50 ( barns & efstathiou 1987 ) and the gas density enhances by a factor of @xmath51 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the duration of emission is therefore @xmath54 ,    \\label{eq_teq}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the time taken to reach @xmath56 from @xmath52 .      in predicting the luminosity and the abundance of protogalaxies ,",
    "we also take into account explicitly hierarchical clustering and mergers of these objects .",
    "this is of particular importance at high redshift , say @xmath57 , where a significant fraction of galaxy - scale halos merges into larger halos before the free - fall time is reached . for such halos ,",
    "the duration of emission will be shorter than that estimated in sec [ secemit ] .",
    "we incorporate the variations in the emission times by defining the `` merger probability weighed average luminosity '' of a protogalaxy with total mass @xmath58 at redshift @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the intrinsic line luminosity at @xmath59 of the galaxy virialized at @xmath62 , corresponding to the cosmic time @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the probability distribution of formation epochs of virialized halos .",
    "the former quantity is computed using the model described in sec [ secemit ] .",
    "since @xmath65 is typically an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath66 , we neglect the changes in @xmath67 and @xmath52 between @xmath59 and @xmath62 . for the latter we adopt the prescription of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) as described in kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) ; the formation epoch @xmath62 is defined as the time at which a halo assembles at least half of its final mass . in the rest of this paper ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we simply refer as `` luminosity '' to that given in equation ( [ eqlum ] ) .",
    "the number density of protogalaxies in accord with the above definition of average luminosity is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the press - schechter ( 1974 ) mass function .",
    "if strong bias is present in such high redshift we consider here , namely @xmath70 , the number of observable objects increases remarkably . in this sense",
    ", our result , which corresponds to the no bias case , can be regarded as the lower bound on the number of objects .",
    "in the following , we consider two epochs in the early universe , @xmath7120 and 8 .",
    "the former corresponds to the typical epoch for the first star formation ( e.g. , abel et al .",
    "the latter is believed to be shortly before the completion of the cosmic reionization from the observation of high - redshift quasars ( e.g. , becker et al .",
    "2001 ) . direct observation of objects forming in this epoch is therefore intersting for understanding the reionization process .",
    "the total luminosity in h@xmath0 lines is shown in figure 1 as a function of the total mass of the objects , along with the ly@xmath2 luminosity for the virial redshift ( a)@xmath7220 and ( b)@xmath728 . the corresponding virial temperature and the observed flux are indicated in the top and right axes .",
    "the observed flux in a line is calculated using the usual relation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the luminosity distance to the source at redshift @xmath59 .",
    "the contribution to the total h@xmath0 luminosity from each line is shown in figure 2 for the fiducial case ( @xmath43 ) and in figure 3 for the dissipationless case ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "important lines are listed in table 1 ( for @xmath75 ) and 2 ( for @xmath11 ) for the fiducial case .",
    "we first focus on the fiducial case @xmath43 . from the h@xmath0 emission property",
    ", the protogalactic clouds can be categorized into the following four mass ranges . the temperature evolution for typical cases in these regimes",
    "is shown in figure 4 for @xmath75 .    * _ pop iii objects _  ( @xmath76 ) + small objects whose virial temperature @xmath77k can not excite atomic hydrogen , and cool only by h@xmath0 lines .",
    "thus both the thermal energy at virialization and the gravitational energy liberated by the collapse are converted to h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the dominant lines are the lowest excitation ones , e.g. , 0 - 0s(0 ) at 28 @xmath7 m and 0 - 0s(1 ) at 17 @xmath7 m ( see figure 2 ) . * _ dwarf galaxies _",
    "( @xmath78 ) + clouds with a virial temperature exceeding @xmath8k can cool by ly@xmath2 radiation .",
    "as we can see in figure 4 , the temperature first drops rapidly from the virial temperature to that appropriate for h@xmath0 cooling ( @xmath79k ) .",
    "the initial thermal energy is radiated away by the atomic radiation processes including the ly@xmath2 emission ( @xmath80k ) and by the h@xmath0 line emission ( @xmath81k ) .",
    "the collapse proceeds quasi - isothermally thereafter due to the h@xmath0 line emission .",
    "this can be observed in figure 1 as the emergence of ly@xmath2 luminosity . at the same time , the slope of the increase of the h@xmath0 line luminosity toward higher mass flattens slightly around @xmath82k .",
    "the low excitation lines , e.g. 0 - 0s(1 ) at 17 @xmath7 m and 0 - 0s(3 ) at 9.7 @xmath7 m , are still dominant ( figure 2 ) . * _ giant galaxies _",
    "( @xmath83 ) + since the available gravitational energy increases toward massive objects , the heating rate by the dissipation of kinetic energy also increases . for objects",
    "@xmath84 , the heating becomes so great that the temperature does not fall below @xmath3k .",
    "these objects collapse isothermally at @xmath3k , after initial rapid cooling ( see figure 4 a ) . during this isothermal collapse ,",
    "a large fraction of energy is emitted in the ly@xmath2 radiation .",
    "then the ly@xmath2 luminosity exceeds the h@xmath0 luminosity ( figure 1 ) for those objects . despite the high temperature ,",
    "a small amount of h@xmath0 is present .",
    "only a small fraction of gravitational energy is emitted in the h@xmath0 lines .",
    "this can be observed as a plateau in the h@xmath0 luminosity in figure 1 , as the larger mass compensates for the lower h@xmath0 emissivity .",
    "corresponding to the abrupt change in thermal property , the dominant lines are altered ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "because the collapse proceeds with high temperature , high excitation lines become more important .",
    "the strongest line is 0 - 0s(3 ) at @xmath85 m .",
    "although 0 - 0s(1 ) is still in the second place , the vibrational line 1 - 0s(3 ) at @xmath86 m also becomes important .",
    "these objects are the brightest ones in h@xmath0 emission and the h@xmath0 luminosity reaches about @xmath87 .",
    "note that these are also most luminous in ly@xmath2 emission . * _ no - cooling objects _ ( @xmath88 ) + for these massive objects , both ly@xmath2 and h@xmath0 luminosities decline rapidly , because , in the redshift range we are considering , such massive objects can not cool within the merging timescale and then remain in the virialization state ( silk 1977 ; rees & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "we stress the importance of the dissipation of kinetic energy .",
    "early studies by saslow & zipoy ( 1967 ) and by izotov & kolesnik ( 1984 ) did not take the dissipation into account . as we can see in figure 1",
    ", the maximum h@xmath0 luminosity would be smaller by an order of magnitude without the dissipation of kinematic energy . in this case",
    ", only the portion of the initial thermal energy below 10@xmath89k would be available for h@xmath0 emission , with most gravitational energy being converted into kinetic energy .",
    "the discrepancy in emitted energy increases toward higher mass because of the larger gravitational energy to be released during the collapse ; in the dissipationless case , the h@xmath0 luminosity increases only linearly in mass , while in the dissipational case it increases approximately as @xmath90 .",
    "h@xmath0-line photons emitted at @xmath91 have been red - shifted to the far - infrared ( fir ) wavelength today .",
    "the future space telescope , the _ single aperture far - infrared observatory _",
    "( _ safir _ ) , is planned to have unprecedented sensitivity at the fir and submillimeter wavelengths , with the limiting flux of @xmath92 in fir . with this limiting flux",
    ", brightest sources at @xmath11 can be observable by the 0 - 0s(3 ) 9.7@xmath7 m line ( figure 2 b ) , while at redshift @xmath75 , even the brightest h@xmath0 emitters are below this threshold ( figure 2 a ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the number of sources per unit solid angle above the limiting flux of ( a ) @xmath93 and ( b ) @xmath94 whose emission redshift is larger than @xmath59 . for the limiting flux @xmath93 , which is the planned limit for _ safir",
    "_ , although the number of sources with their h@xmath0 total flux exceeding this limit is about 10@xmath95 as early as @xmath96 , even the strongest line 0 - 0s(3 ) 9.7 @xmath7 m can not be observed until @xmath11 ( see figure 5 a ) .",
    "we can understand this from figure 2 ( b ) ; at @xmath11 , although the maximum total h@xmath0 flux exceeds @xmath97 by some factor , even the most dominant line 0 - 0s(3 ) 9.7@xmath7 m barely reaches this limiting flux because of sharing the luminosity with other lines .    for the limiting flux @xmath94 , the brightest objects at @xmath75 could be visible by the 0 - 0s(3 ) 9.7@xmath7 m line and the 0 - 0s(1 ) 17@xmath7 m line ( figure 2 a ) , although such massive objects are still very rare at @xmath75 ( figure 5 b ) . for this limiting flux , the number of sources observable by these lines exceeds @xmath98 str@xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "figure 6 further illustrates the number of h@xmath0 emitters for each line above the limiting flux per unit redshift range at @xmath11 . at the limiting flux of _ safir _ , @xmath97 , observable lines are 0 - 0s(3 ) 9.7@xmath7 m , and possibly 0 - 0s(1 ) 17@xmath7 m , although the latter slightly falls short of @xmath101 .",
    "if the limiting flux were an order of magnitude deeper , some vibrational lines including 1 - 0q(1 ) 2.4 @xmath7 m and 1 - 0s(1 ) 2.1@xmath7 m could also be detected .",
    "finally , figure 7 displays the contribution of these h@xmath0 emitters to the extragalactic fir background radiation .",
    "also plotted for reference is the fir background spectrum detected by _ cobe / firas _ ( fixsen et al .",
    "the h@xmath0 line emission from forming galaxies makes only a negligible contribution to the background light , being smaller than the _ cobe / firas _ result by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we have evaluated the amount of h@xmath0 line radiation from forming galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath0 line luminosity reaches the maximum value of about @xmath102 for protogalaxies of total mass @xmath103 . below this mass scale , all the gravitational energy is emitted by h@xmath0 line radiation , while above this scale , a large part of the energy is emitted by ly@xmath2 radiation .",
    "such brightest objects at @xmath6 are detectable by the next generation telescope _ safir _ via the 0 - 0s(3 ) 9.7@xmath7 m line emission and marginally detectable also via the 0 - 0s(1)17@xmath7 m line .",
    "the cosmic fir background radiation by the h@xmath0 emission is several orders of magnitude below the detected value of _ cobe / firas _ , and can be safely neglected .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity from a protogalactic cloud has also been studied by shchekinov ( 1991 ) . assuming that a protogalactic cloud consists of subclumps and that the luminosity is given by the sum of luminosity from each subclumps , he evaluated @xmath104 from a protogalactic cloud with gas mass @xmath105 corresponding to total mass @xmath106 . on the other hand , in our model the large protogalaxies of @xmath107",
    "has no time to cool and then emit only weak h@xmath0 radiation ( total h@xmath0 luminosty @xmath108 ) .",
    "this is because such inhomogenous clouds are regarded as a cluster of protogalactic clouds rather than a single cloud in our scheme .",
    "in fact , the sum of luminosity from a cluster with total mass of @xmath106 gives a similar value as that of shchekinov ( 1991 ) .",
    "for example , the luminosity of a protogalactic cloud of @xmath109 collapsing at @xmath75 is @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] a ) .",
    "then the h@xmath0 luminosity of a cluster consisting of 10@xmath111 such clouds is @xmath112 .",
    "note that in order for this value to be the actual luminosity from the cluster , the collapse of the subclumps must be simultaneous . since this is probably a rare occurence , this possibility is not considered in this paper .    as we mentioned in  3 , the brightest h@xmath0 sources , `` giant galaxies '' , are even more luminous in the ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "this has been pointed out also by shchekinov ( 1991 ) . who investigated pancaking shock of primordial clouds .",
    "consequently , the most efficient way of finding h@xmath0 emitters is to look at the already detected ly@xmath2 emitters , rather than looking for them in a blank field .",
    "the origin of ly@xmath2 emitters found at high - redshift is still in dispute .",
    "if ly@xmath2 emitters are originating in the cooling radiation , they might be bright as well as in the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "on the other hand , the ly@xmath2 emission might be originating in the recombination radiation due to stellar ionization ( partridge & peebles 1967 ) . in this case",
    ", there is no reason to expect bright h@xmath0 emission from those sources .",
    "nonetheless , since h@xmath0 is vulnerable to photodissociation by stars as we will discuss below , even if the h@xmath0 emission will not be detected , this will not demonstrate the recombination origin for the ly@xmath2 radiation .    here , we discuss some effects that can alter the amount of the h@xmath0 luminosity from forming galaxies .",
    "the density contrast inside the clouds , in particular higher density than average in the inner region , results in luminosity higher by some factor , reducing the collapse timescale compared to the merging timescale . on the other hand ,",
    "the following effects reduce the h@xmath0 luminosity : first , molecular hydrogen is vulnerable to photodissociation by stars . according to the recent wmap results",
    ", the reionization epoch of the universe could be as early as @xmath113 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . at least below this redshift ,",
    "protogalaxies are irradiated by the uv background radiation . according to our study , objects most luminous in h@xmath0 emission are massive ones whose mass is about 10% of @xmath114 galaxies today . such massive objects are not vulnerable to photodissociation by uv background radiation .",
    "therefore , our results remain unchanged except for `` popiii objects '' , for which the feedback effect is significant ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; omukai & nishi 1999 ; ciardi et al . 2000 ; kitayama et al .",
    "2001 ; ricotti et al . 2002 ) .",
    "although `` giant galaxies '' are not affected by the uv background radiation , an internal uv field created by local star formation might photodissociate molecular hydrogen and then reduce the amount of the h@xmath0 emission . another possibility for reducing",
    "the h@xmath0 emissivity is by metal enrichment ; with metals , the energy budget for h@xmath0 emission is reduced by the cooling via metal fine - structure and metastable lines ( e.g. , dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) . for the metallicity @xmath115",
    ", the metal line cooling dominates over the h@xmath0 line cooling ( e.g. , fall & rees 1985 ) . below this metallicity ,",
    "the h@xmath0 cooling dominates and thus the effect of metal lines in reducing the h@xmath0 luminosity can be neglected .",
    "further study of the influence of stellar feedback and metal enrichment on the h@xmath0 emission will be interesting .",

    "<S> we study the h@xmath0 cooling emission of forming galaxies , and discuss their observability using the future infrared facility _ safir_. forming galaxies with mass @xmath1 emit most of their gravitational energy liberated by contraction in molecular hydrogen line radiation , although a large part of thermal energy at virialization is radiated away by the h ly@xmath2 emission . for more massive objects , </S>",
    "<S> the degree of heating due to dissipation of kinetic energy is so great that the temperature does not drop below @xmath3k and the gravitational energy is emitted mainly by the ly@xmath2 emission . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the total h@xmath0 luminosity attains the peak value of @xmath4 for forming galaxies whose total mass @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if these sources are situated at redshift @xmath6 , they can be detected by rotational lines of 0 - 0s(3 ) at 9.7@xmath7 m and 0 - 0s(1 ) at 17@xmath7 m by _ safir_. an efficient way to find such h@xmath0 emitters is to look at the ly@xmath2 emitters , since the brightest h@xmath0 emitters are also luminous in the ly@xmath2 emission . </S>"
