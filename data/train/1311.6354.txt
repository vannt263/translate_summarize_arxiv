    "the periodic monopole can be constructed by use of a generalised nahm transform , which maps between solutions of the @xmath6 bogomolny equations of charge @xmath7 on @xmath2 , and rank @xmath7 hitchin data on the dual cylinder @xmath8 . on the monopole side",
    "we define the complex coordinate @xmath9 on @xmath10 and @xmath11 on @xmath12 , while on the nahm / hitchin cylinder we define @xmath13 and @xmath14 which we combine into a complex coordinate @xmath15 .",

    "the spectral curve of a periodic monopole was introduced by cherkis & kapustin @xcite where an equivalence was proven between the ` monopole ' and ` hitchin ' spectral curves , which are polynomials of degree @xmath4 in @xmath31 and of degree @xmath7 in @xmath32 .",

    "a straightforward extension of the charge @xmath4 solutions described in the previous section is a modification of `` sutcliffe s ansatz '' @xcite .",
    "solutions generated in this way have @xmath123 for @xmath124 in . we take @xmath125 mimicking the charge @xmath4 procedure , we define @xmath126 , with the conditions @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the hitchin equations then become @xmath129 @xmath130 where the index @xmath131 is periodic , such that @xmath132 . as was the case in section [ charge2 ] ,",

    "this approach was found to lead to rapidly convergent solutions as long as the boundary conditions were chosen appropriately .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to write down an asymptotic solution to valid away from the zeroes of @xmath112 by making the ansatz @xmath145 and solving for the @xmath146 ( this solution is singular at the zeroes of @xmath112 and is thus not globally valid ) . for @xmath53 and @xmath111",
    "we find @xmath147    there is some freedom in the choice of imaginary parts of the functions @xmath141 , which must be chosen so as to make the nahm data periodic on the cylinder .",
    "we fix @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "a different choice simply corresponds to a global shift in the @xmath33 direction , and the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to @xmath151 .",
    "one might also be concerned by the fact that is not explicitly positive definite due to the term linear in @xmath141 , which does not appear in the charge @xmath4 case .",
    "we again resort to the convergence of the numerical solution to justify this approach .",
    "it is easy to see that there are no solutions with @xmath152 everywhere .",
    "this tells us that the charge @xmath3 chain of period @xmath92 is not included in this family of solutions , as this would require @xmath153 ( see also section [ rescaling ] ) .",
    "spatial symmetries of the monopole fields can be studied by the procedure outlined in section [ charge2 ] .",
    "first of all we choose a transformation of @xmath96 ( or @xmath154 ) and @xmath38 which preserves the spectral curve for a given transformation of @xmath32 .",
    "then we express the transformed hitchin fields as a gauge transformation of the original fields .",
    "this allows us to read off the corresponding change in @xmath33 from the inverse nahm operator .",
    "note that if we restrict to gauge transformations which change the positions and phases of the entries of @xmath18 , then the overall ordering of the @xmath155 is unchanged ( or reversed in the case of @xmath156 ) .",
    "this property gives the solutions @xmath110 and @xmath157 ( for @xmath7 even ) an additional @xmath158 symmetry ( corresponding to @xmath159 ) , which is not observed for general @xmath48 .",
    "various scattering processes generalising those in section [ charge2 ] are described in the following subsections , and we visualise them with reference to chains of small monopoles ( @xmath160 ) . in summary , it is found that the geodesics are characterised by the positions of the zeroes among the entries of @xmath18 , say at @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "then for @xmath163 the monopoles are located on the vertices of a regular @xmath7-gon at @xmath164 ( the @xmath33 position is determined numerically ) .",
    "as @xmath165 is reduced they scatter and split into two clusters of charge @xmath48 moving along the positive @xmath33 axis and @xmath166 along the negative @xmath33 axis .",
    "the clusters move at speeds inversely proportional to their charges , such that for @xmath167 the outgoing monopoles emerge at @xmath168 on a ( possibly rotated ) @xmath7-gon . following the discussion of @xcite",
    "we expect there to be a closed geodesic with @xmath121 , describing stationary monopoles oscillating in shape .",
    "a discussion of the motion of higgs zeroes is given in section [ higgszeroes ] .",
    "the geodesic surface @xmath169 with @xmath115 or @xmath116 describes scattering in the @xmath46 plane via a @xmath170-symmetric toroidal configuration .",
    "we see this as follows :    first of all , note that under the transformation @xmath158 , @xmath112 and @xmath171 are invariant and @xmath172 .",
    "the form of the inverse nahm operator now tells us that the monopole fields are invariant if we also replace @xmath33 by @xmath173 .",
    "thus , this monopole configuration has the symmetry @xmath174 , consistent with the @xmath7 incoming monopoles being located at @xmath168 ( the fixed point set of this transformation ) .    to see the @xmath170 symmetry we perform the transformation @xmath175 , giving @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",

    "a special case is provided by @xmath256 with @xmath110 and @xmath186 .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath259 shows that this is equivalent to the charge @xmath94 case with @xmath260 and @xmath204 ( see section [ symmetricsplitting ] ) . in other words",
    ", there are particular charge @xmath94 configurations which can be understood as charge @xmath4 chains `` in disguise '' , a result which could be anticipated by the @xmath118 symmetry of both cases .",
    "the decoupling of the nahm data into block - diagonal form suggests the relevant monopoles are ` maximally separated ' and non - interacting .",
    "this is reminiscent of the decoupling of the moduli space metric of a charge @xmath4 monopole into a direct product of two @xmath3-monopole moduli space metrics for two well separated monopoles , @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper extends the construction of periodic monopoles of charge @xmath3 and @xmath4 to a particular family of higher charges .",
    "the resulting scattering processes correspond ( in the small size to period ratio ) to those scattering processes in @xmath1 with cyclic symmetry @xcite , and it is clear how the number of different possibilites of a charge @xmath7 monopole splitting into two clusters arises naturally from the structure of the hitchin fields .",
    "we also conisder a special case in which equally charged clusters are maximally separated , allowing the nahm data to decouple and a description to be made in terms of lower charge monopoles .",
    "there remain further geodesic submanifolds that do not fit the ansatz . in particular , the search is still underway for solutions of the hitchin equations with @xmath232 and @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ geo3 ] ) , for which only the example has been identified .",
    "a related question is whether one can construct a charge @xmath7 ` twisted chain ' of equally spaced monopoles invariant under a joint rotation and shift : @xmath261 for @xmath262 .",
    "the existence of monopole chains with this symmetry has been established @xcite , but explicit periodic solutions are only available for @xmath263 and @xmath264 : they are the points on @xmath265 with @xmath186 ( @xmath266 ) . for @xmath267 , @xmath53 the spectral curve",
    "is expected to have @xmath65 ( central panel of fig .",
    "[ geo3 ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to consider whether this solution can be described as a point on the geodesic containing the ` tripled chain ' of section [ rescaling ] and fig .",
