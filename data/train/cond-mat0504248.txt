    "from microfluidic technology to detergent design and ink - jet printing it is vital to understand the way in which drops move across surfaces .",
    "the dynamics of the drops will be affected by any chemical or topological heterogeneities on the surface . until recently such disorder was usually regarded as undesirable . however with the advent of microfabrication techniques it has become possible to control the chemical or topographical patterning of a substrate on micron length scales , leading to the possibility of exploring new physics and to novel applications .    a beautiful example of this , inspired by the leaves of the lotus plant , are superhydrophobic substrates .",
    "these are surfaces which are covered with posts on length scales of order microns . as a result of the topological patterning they are strongly repellent to water droplets which show contact angles up to @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this should be compared to more traditional ways of increasing the contact angle , surface coatings and chemical modifications of the substrate , where it is difficult to achieve an angle of more than @xmath3 .",
    "superhydrophobic substrates have many potential applications , for example as materials for raincoats or windscreens .",
    "the evolutionary advantage to the lotus appears to be the easy run - off which helps to clean the leaves of the plant .",
    "droplets on a superhydrophobic surface can be in two states , suspended where the drop sits on top of the posts with pockets of air beneath it , or collapsed where it wets the grooves between the posts .",
    "several authors have calculated the free energies of the suspended and collapsed states using approximations based on the cassie - baxter and wenzel laws respectively  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that both states can be thermodynamically stable with the phase boundary between them depending on the surface tension and substrate geometry .",
    "it has also been argued that the suspended drop is often observed as a metastable state as it has to cross a free energy barrier to fill the grooves .",
    "however the kinetics of the transition to the collapsed phase is not understood : it is not accessible to the equilibrium theories and it is hard to probe experimentally",
    ".    therefore in this paper we present a numerical solution to equations which are able to describe both the static and dynamic behaviour of droplets on topologically patterned substrates .",
    "the droplet dynamics is described by the navier - stokes equations for a liquid - gas system .",
    "its equilibrium behaviour corresponds to a chosen free energy functional so that appropriate thermodynamic information , such as the surface tension and the contact angle , are included in the model .",
    "we solve the equations of motion using a lattice boltzmann algorithm .",
    "this approach has a natural length scale , for fluids such as water , of order microns where much of the exciting new physics is expected to appear .",
    "the method has already shown its capability in dealing with spreading on surfaces with chemical patterning  @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we summarise the algorithm and , particularly , describe the new thermodynamic and velocity boundary conditions needed to treat surfaces with topological patterning . in section 3",
    "we present results for a substrate patterned by an array of posts and show that the patterning leads to a substantial increase in contact angle in agreement with experiments .",
    "we then explore the kinetics of the transition between the suspended and collapsed droplet states .",
    "finally we discuss directions for future work using this approach .",
    "we consider a liquid - gas system of density @xmath4 and volume @xmath5 .",
    "the surface of the substrate is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the drop are described by the free energy @xmath7 where einstein notation is understood for the cartesian label @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath9 ) and where @xmath10 is the free energy in the bulk .",
    "we conveniently choose the double well form  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the critical pressure , density and temperature respectively and @xmath17 is a constant typically equal to @xmath18 .    the derivative term in equation ( [ eq : freee ] ) models the free energy associated with density gradients at an interface .",
    "@xmath19 is related to the surface tension @xmath20 by  @xcite @xmath21    @xmath22 is the cahn surface free energy  @xcite which controls the wetting properties of the fluid . in particular @xmath23 can be used to tune the contact angle .",
    "the dynamics of the droplet is described by the navier - stokes equations for a non - ideal gas @xmath24 + nf_\\alpha , \\nonumber \\\\ \\partial_t n + \\partial_\\alpha(n u_\\alpha ) & = & 0 \\label{eq : ns } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fluid velocity , @xmath26 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath27 a gravitational field .",
    "the pressure tensor @xmath28 is related to the free energy by  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the bulk chemical potential .",
    "we solve the equations of motion ( [ eq : ns ] ) by using a lattice boltzmann algorithm .",
    "this approach follows the evolution of partial distribution functions @xmath32 on a regular , @xmath33-dimensional lattice formed of sites @xmath34 .",
    "the label @xmath35 denotes velocity directions and runs between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is a standard lattice topology classification .",
    "the @xmath39 lattice we use here has the following velocity vectors @xmath40 : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 in lattice units as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d3q15 ] .",
    "the lattice boltzmann dynamics are given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the time step of the simulation , @xmath48 the relaxation time .",
    "@xmath49 labels velocities of different magnitude , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the equilibrium distribution function which is a function of the density @xmath53 and the fluid velocity @xmath54 , defined through the relation @xmath55    the relaxation time tunes the kinematic viscosity as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the lattice spacing .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that equation  ( [ eq : lbdynamics ] ) reproduces the navier - stokes equations of a non - ideal gas ( [ eq : ns ] ) if the local equilibrium functions are chosen as @xmath58 a possible choice of the coefficients is  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the major challenge in dealing with patterned substrates is to handle the boundary conditions correctly .",
    "we consider first wetting boundary conditions which control the value of the density derivative and hence the contact angle .",
    "for flat substrates a boundary condition can be established by minimising the free energy ( [ eq : freee ] )  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the unit vector normal to the substrate .",
    "it is possible to obtain an expression relating @xmath23 to the contact angle @xmath64 as  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and the function @xmath67 returns the sign of its argument .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cahn1 ] ) is used to constrain the density derivative for sites on a flat part of the substrate . however , no such exact results are available for sites at edges or corners .",
    "we work on the principle that the wetting angle at such sites should be constrained as little as possible so that , in the limit of an increasingly fine mesh , it is determined by the contact angle of the neighbouring flat surfaces .    for edges ( labels @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : postmask ] ) and corners ( labels @xmath69 ) at the top of the post each site has @xmath70 neighbours on the computational mesh . therefore these sites can be treated as bulk sites .    at bottom edges where the post abuts the surface ( labels @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : postmask ] ) density derivatives in the two directions normal to the surface ( e.g. @xmath72 and @xmath37 for sites labeled @xmath73 ) are calculated using @xmath74 where the middle term constrains the density derivative in the appropriate direction @xmath72 or @xmath75 .    at bottom corners where the post joins the surface ( labels @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig : postmask ] ) density derivatives in both the @xmath72 and @xmath75 directions are known .",
    "therefore these sites are treated as planar sites .",
    "we impose a no - slip boundary condition on the velocity by determining the missing fields which fulfill the no - slip condition given by equation ( [ lb : velocity ] ) with @xmath77 .",
    "this does not uniquely determine the @xmath32 s .",
    "for most of the cases ( i.e. @xmath78 ) arbitrary choices guided by symmetry are used to close the system .",
    "this is no longer possible for sites @xmath79 where four asymmetrical choices are available .",
    "selecting one of those solutions or using a simple algorithm which chooses one of them at random each time step leads to very comparable and symmetrical results .",
    "hence we argue that an asymmetrical choice can be used .",
    "possible conditions , which are used in the results reported here , are listed in appendix a.    the conservation of mass is ensured by setting a suitable rest field , @xmath80 , equal to the difference between the density of the missing fields and the one of the fields entering the solid after collision .    in a hydrodynamic description of wetting contact line slip",
    "must be introduced in some way . as with other phase field models",
    "slip appears naturally within the lattice boltzmann framework .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the slip is evaporation and condensation of the fluid because of a non - equilibrium curvature of the contact line  @xcite .",
    "we consider the superhydrophobic behaviour of droplet spreading on a substrate patterned by square posts arranged as in fig .",
    "[ fig : substrate ] .",
    "the size of the domain is @xmath81 and the height , spacing and width of posts are @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "a spherical droplet of radius @xmath85 is initially centered within the domain and just touches the post tops .",
    "the contact angle @xmath86 is set on every substrate site .",
    "the surface tension and the viscosity are tuned by choosing parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "the liquid density @xmath89 and gas density @xmath90 are set to @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the temperature @xmath93 .",
    "simulation and physical parameters can be related by choosing a length scale @xmath94 , a time scale @xmath95 and a mass scale @xmath96 .",
    "a simulation parameter with dimensions @xmath97^{n_1}[t]^{n_2}[m]^{n_3}$ ] is multiplied by @xmath98 to give the physical value .",
    "for example , considering a @xmath99 mm droplet of a fluid of kinematic viscosity @xmath100 m@xmath101s@xmath102 and surface tension @xmath103 nm@xmath102 leads to @xmath104 m , @xmath105 s , @xmath106 kg . that implies @xmath107 kgm@xmath108 .",
    "however , as with all diffuse interface models the liquid - gas density difference is unphysically small and the width of the interface is too large . this must be taken into account by renormalising the time scale .",
    "[ fig : results1 ] shows the final state attained by the droplet for different substrates or initial conditions . for comparison fig .",
    "[ fig : results1](a ) shows a planar substrate .",
    "the equilibrium contact angle is @xmath109 as expected  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : results1](b ) the substrate is patterned and the initial velocity of the drop is zero . now the contact angle is @xmath110 , a demonstration of superhydrophobic behaviour .",
    "[ fig : results1](c ) reports an identical geometry but a drop with an initial impact velocity . now",
    "the drop is able to collapse onto the substrate and the final angle is @xmath111 .",
    "these angles are compatible with the ones reported in  @xcite .",
    "m1cmm5cmm0.5cmm5 cm ( a ) & & & + ( b ) & & & + ( c ) & & & +    superhydrophobicity occurs over a wide range of @xmath33 , the distance between the posts .",
    "for suspended drops of @xmath85 and @xmath112 the drop resides on a single post and the contact angle is @xmath113 . for @xmath114",
    "the contact angle lies between @xmath115 and @xmath1 with the range primarily due to the commensurability between drop radius and post spacing .",
    "we now investigate the kinetics of the transition between the suspended and collapsed droplet states . for the parameter values used in the simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : results1 ] the state with the drop suspended on the posts has a slightly higher free energy than the collapsed state .",
    "however as the drop penetrates the grooves the area of the contact between liquid and solid increases . because the substrate is hydrophobic this creates a free energy barrier hindering the transition from the suspended to the collapsed states .",
    "work must be provided , by an impact velocity or gravity say , to allow the transition to proceed  @xcite .",
    "we follow the transition pathway by considering a spherical droplet of radius @xmath85 initially centered within the domain and just touching the top of the posts .",
    "a gravitational field @xmath116 is turned on at time @xmath117 , and turned off at @xmath118 .",
    "[ fig : snapse ] shows cross sections of the drop as it undergoes the transition from the suspended to the collapsed state for @xmath119 .",
    "note how the substrate interstices are filled successively from the drop centre to its edges .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the figures show that both the surface and the volume energies increase during the transition .",
    "hence , as the total free energy must decrease , the transition could not occur without the addition of a gravitational force .",
    "the decrease in the gravitational free energy offsets the increase in the surface and volume terms allowing the transition to proceed .",
    "essentially the addition of @xmath116 removes the barrier which the total free energy must surmount .",
    "a lower gravitational field , @xmath120 , does not allow the drop to overcome the free energy barrier and it remains in the suspended state as shown by the dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : energy ] .",
    "for example , considering again a @xmath99 mm droplet of a fluid of kinematic viscosity @xmath100 m@xmath101s@xmath102 and surface tension @xmath121 nm@xmath102 , @xmath122 would correspond to 9.7 ms@xmath123 in physical units .",
    "we have used a lattice boltzmann approach to solve the equations of motion describing the dynamics of a drop on topologically patterned substrate .",
    "the approach allows us to simulate the dynamic and equilibrium properties of a drop with a given size , surface tension , contact angle and viscosity . because interfaces appear naturally within the model it is particularly well suited to looking at the behaviour of evolving drops .",
    "in particular we have considered a droplet positioned on an array of posts and shown that it is possible to reproduce the superhydrophobic behaviour seen in experiments .",
    "the ability of the algorithm to follow the drop kinetics has enabled us to investigate the transitions between the suspended state where the drop lies on top of the posts and the collapsed state where it fills the spaces between them .",
    "we find that the substrate interstices are filled successively starting from the drop centre .",
    "there are many avenues open for further investigation .",
    "for example we are currently investigating how drops move across hydrophobic surfaces to compare to recent experiments .",
    "it would also be interesting to follow the spreading of drops on surfaces with topological imperfections , a problem of concern in the quality of images formed in ink - jet printing .",
