    "to support the various string duality conjectures , numerous tests have been successfully performed .",
    "so far lacking is a more quantitative test of the basic heterotic-@xmath3 theory @xcite duality in eight dimensions , i.e. , a comparison of non - trivial terms in the effective action .",
    "the terms we have in mind are certain corrections to the @xmath8 couplings .",
    "these couplings are related to the special class of `` holomorphic '' @xcite or `` bps - saturated '' @xcite amplitudes , which involve @xmath9 external gauge bosons ( in theories with 4,8 or 16 supercharges , resp . ) , and which are directly related to the heterotic elliptic genus @xmath10 @xcite in @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "it turns out that supersymmetry relates parity even ( @xmath12 ) and parity odd ( @xmath13 ) sectors , and therefore one can conveniently combine the theta - angle and the coupling constant @xmath14 into one complex coupling , @xmath15 . specifically , functionally non - trivial one - loop corrections arise in @xmath1 compactifications of @xmath11 dimensional @xmath16 supersymmetric heterotic strings generically as follows : @xmath17\\ , \\f\\wedge^n \\f\\ \\ , \\sim\\ \\int { d^2\\tau\\over { \\tau_2 } } z_{(2,2)}(t , u , q,\\ov q)\\hat\\ca_{2n+2}(\\f , q ) \\attac{2n - form}\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 are the khler and complex structure moduli and @xmath19 is the partition function of the two - torus @xmath1 ( we have switched off any wilson lines infrom analyticity , the imaginary part of @xmath15 is determined essentially by the same expression . for gauge theories with the indicated number of supersymmetries , it is known that perturbative contributions arise to one loop order only and have the form this formula ) @xmath20\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the higgs field and @xmath22 a cutoff scale ; in string theory , there will be additional @xmath23 corrections . as is by now familiar , logarithmic monodromy shifts correspond to physically irrelevant shifts of the @xmath24angle .    in heterotic compactifications on @xmath25 to four dimensions ,",
    "such couplings multiplying @xmath26 are given by two derivatives of a holomorphic prepotential , @xmath27 .",
    "they have been computed for a variety of heterotic compactifications @xcite and reproduced in the dual type ii string setup @xcite .",
    "here one makes use of mirror symmetry @xcite of suitable cy manifolds , to compute three - point couplings of the generic form @xmath28 , which in turn are equal to @xmath29 .",
    "analogous @xmath8 couplings in @xmath30 have recently been analyzed in detail @xcite , focusing on heterotic and type i string compactifications on @xmath1 and on gauge fields @xmath31 belonging to @xmath4 or @xmath32 . it was argued in @xcite and shown in @xcite that such four - point couplings can be expressed in terms of holomorphic prepotentials , similar as in four dimensions .",
    "this hints at the existence of a superspace representation of the effective lagrangians ; however , to our knowledge , neither this formalism nor an analog of `` special geometry '' seems to have been developed .",
    "in contrast to the couplings in @xmath33 , the heterotic couplings @xmath15 in @xmath30 are supposedly exact at one loop order @xcite . indeed , for theories with 16 supercharges , the dilaton sits in a gravitational multiplet and thus can not mix with the vector moduli space .",
    "therefore there is no room for non - perturbative corrections , and correspondingly the cutoff in ( [ lntau ] ) is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the couplings @xmath15 thus provide an ideal , quantitative testing ground for the heterotic-@xmath3 theory duality .    in the present paper",
    ", we will concentrate on certain couplings @xmath35 arising in theories with @xmath4 and @xmath5 gauge symmetry . in section 2",
    ", we will compute these couplings from the heterotic string , which amounts to evaluating certain integrals that were not treated before in the literature ; some more technical material is deferred to appendices .",
    "we will find that the couplings in the @xmath18 sub - sector derive from an underlying prepotential @xmath36 , @xmath37    and that they formally have a structure that is very similar to the well - known couplings in @xmath38 .",
    "that is , taking one more derivative , we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 etc . , and where @xmath41 are certain integer coefficients . from the heterotic string point of view , this is perhaps not too surprising , given that the structure of the modular integrals is similar in spirit ( though much more complicated ) as in four dimensions .",
    "the situation is however quite non - trivial when considered from a `` dual '' viewpoint , which is @xmath3-theory @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that heterotic compactifications on @xmath1 are dual to @xmath3-theory on @xmath7 , so it is natural to expect that the above couplings should be computable entirely from @xmath7 data , at a purely geometrical level .",
    "however , it is a priori not obvious how such holomorphic , quintic couplings could be canonically related to @xmath7 . have been considered in @xcite , but these couplings do not seem to be obviously holomorphic ; see also @xcite . ]    indeed , for a complex @xmath42-fold , the natural holomorphic couplings correspond to intersections of @xmath42 two - forms , and this is why one can use mirror symmetry on 3-fold cy s to compute the three - point couplings @xmath43 . for @xmath7",
    "the natural holomorphic couplings are two - point functions ( which are trivial , ie . , constant @xcite ) , and not five - point functions @xmath44 .",
    "the question thus arises what the geometrical principles are that lead to five - point functions of the requisite structure , and in particular what the meaning of the integral coefficients is . for three - point functions on 3-folds ,",
    "the coefficients are known to count rational curves .",
    "what they precisely count in eq .",
    "( [ counting ] ) for a @xmath7 , may turn out to be an interesting mathematical question ; see section 4 for a few remarks on curve counting on @xmath7 .",
    "we have thus all reason to expect a novel mechanism of mirror symmetry to be at work here , and it is the purpose of the paper to make some first modest steps in uncovering it . we will not find a complete solution of the problem , but will at least show how to relate some couplings to the geometry of @xmath7 .",
    "this will be addressed in section 3 , starting with a discussion of the 7brane geometry for one of the two models that we consider .",
    "we then show how the problem can be simplified , by going to a subspace of the moduli space that corresponds to constant iib coupling and to finite order monodromies in the @xmath45plane .",
    "this allows to lift the geometry to riemann surfaces , which happen to be nothing but well - known seiberg - witten curves . in this way we can find greens functions with the requisite global properties , with which we are able to compute some @xmath0 gauge couplings from geometry . for the couplings of the @xmath5 model",
    ", we find perfect agreement with the corresponding heterotic string results .",
    "we will conclude with some remarks in section 4 .",
    "we intend to give a comprehensive treatment in a more detailed forthcoming analysis .",
    "compactifications of the ten  dimensional heterotic string on a torus have in common @xmath46 n=1 abelian vector multiplets , whose scalars are the @xmath47 and @xmath48 moduli of the torus @xmath1 , besides @xmath49 wilson lines ; for some canonical examples , see table 1 .",

    "second , similar to what we discussed in the previous section , two @xmath112planes can collide to produce a 7plane associated with some extra non - abelian gauge symmetry @xmath286 ( for @xmath287 , where there is no further gauge enhancement , this also corresponds to the decompactification limit ) .",
    "in other words , the generic non - abelian gauge symmetry is @xmath288 , which can be enhanced to @xmath289 .",
    "all this information is summarized in    by computations completely analogous to those in appendix b , we find directly from the @xmath7 s in ( [ kthrees ] ) that the @xmath290 satisfy the schwarzian differential equations @xmath291 where @xmath292 from these equations for @xmath282 , we can easily infer what the modular subgroups are of which @xmath293 is the hauptmodul;^{24/(5-n)}$ ] with @xmath294 for @xmath295 and @xmath296 for @xmath297 . ]",

    "<S> we then discuss how some of these couplings can be obtained in @xmath3-theory , or more precisely from 7brane geometry in type iib language . </S>",
    "<S> we in particular study theories with @xmath4 and @xmath5 gauge symmetry , on certain one - dimensional sub - spaces of the moduli space that correspond to constant iib coupling . for these theories , the relevant geometry can be mapped to riemann surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the computations amount to non - trivial tests of the basic @xmath3-theory  heterotic duality in eight dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , they mean to associate holomorphic 5-point couplings of the form @xmath6 to @xmath7 surfaces . this can be seen as a novel manifestation of the mirror map , acting here between open and closed string sectors .    * w. lerche , s. stieberger *    institute for theoretical physics , + university of california , + santa barbara , ca 93106 , usa    and    cern , ch-1211 + geneva 23 , switzerland </S>"
