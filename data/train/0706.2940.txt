    "at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons as well as top quarks will be produced copiously , due to the large center - of - mass energy of 14 tev ( which leads to increased production cross sections with respect to e.g. the tevatron ) as well as the high luminosity of up to @xmath3 .",
    "these samples can be used not only for precision measurements of standard model parameters such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but also for detector commissioning , alignment and calibration .",
    "furthermore , standard model processes involving @xmath0 bosons and top quarks constitute the primary sources of background in many higgs boson and new physics searches .",
    "this article  @xcite summarizes a few highlights of recent studies  @xcite of the potential of the cms experiment regarding top quark and electroweak physics , in particular in view of the first few 1/fb of data .",
    "they have been performed with a full detector simulation , are based on the reconstruction software and calibration procedures demonstrated in  @xcite , and include estimates of the main systematic uncertainties .",
    "the reactions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with subsequent leptonic decays of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons , have a large cross section and are theoretically well understood .",
    "cross sections above 10 nb ( 1 nb ) are expected at the lhc for the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) channel in the fiducial region of the cms detector .",
    "thousands of leptonic @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays will be recorded for luminosities as low as @xmath10 .",
    "hence , they are useful for many purposes , including a precise luminosity monitor , a high - statistics detector calibration and alignment tool and to demonstrate the performance of the cms experiment",
    ". these reactions will be among the first to be measured at the lhc .",
    "the measurement of the inclusive production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons with cms has been studied in  @xcite and  @xcite for the muon and electron decay channel , respectively .",
    "the emphasis has been put on a start - up oriented event selection with high purity .",
    "already for an integrated luminosity of @xmath11 , the uncertainty in the measured cross section will be dominated by systematics . in case of the muon channel , @xmath12 where the systematic error is dominated by a @xmath13 uncertainty originating from the modeling of the boson @xmath14 dependence , which enters in the acceptance determination .",
    "another important source of theoretical uncertainty is the imperfect knowledge of the parton density functions ( pdfs ) , which affects the absolute normalization by @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "unless more precise pdf sets become available , this will be a limiting factor in comparisons between experiment and theory and in luminosity measurements via @xmath16 counting .",
    "but the argument can also be turned around : these processes can yield important pdf constraints , even without very precise knowledge of the luminosity , in particular by measuring the shapes of differential lepton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 boson mass is an important standard model ( sm ) parameter .",
    "cms has investigated the use of methods involving @xmath17 ratios in the mass measurement , which have the advantage that many experimental and theoretical uncertainties cancel  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wz](left ) shows the simulated transverse mass distribution for @xmath11 in the muon channel  @xcite . for both electron and muon channel , the statistical error on @xmath4",
    "is estimated as 40 ( 15 ) mev for @xmath18 .",
    "the total experimental uncertainty is estimated as 40 ( 20 ) and 64 ( 30 ) mev for the electron and muon channel , respectively .",
    "apart from the pdf uncertainty , the dominating theoretical uncertainty originates from the modeling of the lepton @xmath14 distribution ( estimated as 30 mev ) , which may be improved with higher - order calculations . combining electron and muon channel , the uncertainty on @xmath4",
    "may be reduced to @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the production of diboson pairs can be used to probe triple gauge boson couplings and thus the non - abelian gauge symmetry of electroweak interactions .",
    "such processes are also sensitive to new physics . at the lhc the production cross sections for @xmath21 and @xmath22 pairs are large ( 50 and 20 pb respectively ) .",
    "cms has studied the production of @xmath21 ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 channels ) as well as of @xmath22 ( @xmath25 channel ) pairs  @xcite . for @xmath11 ,",
    "97 events are expected in the @xmath21 channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wz](right ) ) , and a @xmath26 discovery is possible with just @xmath27 of data . in the @xmath28 channel ,",
    "71 events are expected for @xmath29 . the large signal over background ( s / b )",
    "ratio makes these measurements very useful to assess the background in the search for the higgs boson .",
    "the @xmath30 production cross section at the lhc is @xmath31 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than at the tevatron . at a luminosity of @xmath32 ,",
    "about 1 @xmath30 pair will be produced per second , predominantly gluon - induced .",
    "also the cross section of the electroweak production of single top quarks is large , @xmath33 in the t - channel . in @xmath11 of data , around 800k @xmath30 pairs and 350k single top quarks",
    "will be produced , which makes the lhc experiments ideal laboratories to precisely measure top quark properties .",
    "in addition , since large samples of @xmath30 events will be available already with the first year s data , they can also be used as a detector commissioning tool , e.g. to study lepton identification and isolation , jet and missing @xmath34 energy scales and b - tagging performance .",
    "the initial goal will be to measure the @xmath30 cross section , followed by the mass measurement and studies of single top production , polarization or search for flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath30 cross section has been studied in all three decay modes  @xcite . in the semileptonic channel ( fig .  [",
    "fig : top](left ) ) , the cross section can be determined from event counting due to the high @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties are estimated as @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , where the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the knowledge of the b - tagging efficiency , which is conservatively estimated as @xmath39 .",
    "if it could be reduced to @xmath13 , the total error on @xmath40 could be reduced to @xmath39 at @xmath29 , which would already constrain @xmath5 indirectly to @xmath41 , comparable to the precision of the direct measurements at the tevatron . for the dilepton and fully hadronic channels , the statistical ( systematic )",
    "uncertainties are estimated as @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively at @xmath29 .",
    "the top quark mass @xmath5 is related to the higgs mass via loop corrections .",
    "also the measurement of @xmath5 has been studied in all decay modes . in the semileptonic channel  @xcite ,",
    "a simple gaussian fit is compared with the more sophisticated _ ideogram _ method . for @xmath20 , a precision of @xmath44",
    "is estimated for this method .",
    "thus , a 1 gev uncertainty on @xmath5 looks achievable , but requires a very good detector understanding .",
    "the other decay modes  @xcite have been investigated as well . in the dilepton channel an uncertainty of @xmath45 is estimated for @xmath46 , where the systematic error is dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty . in the fully hadronic channel , where a jet pairing likelihood is applied to improve the s / b from 1/9 to 1/3 at constant efficiency ,",
    "the estimate is @xmath47 for @xmath48 .    due to the large cross section",
    "@xmath30 events are useful as a tool to commission and calibrate the detector .",
    "for instance , a study has shown that the light quark jet energy scale can be constrained to the level of @xmath49 by applying a @xmath4 constraint in @xmath30 events  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a high purity selection of dilepton @xmath30 events can be used to constrain the relative b - tagging efficiency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : top](right ) ) to @xmath50 with @xmath51 of data , as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak production of single top quarks has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "single top production is a process is sensitive to new physics ( e.g. heavy @xmath52 bosons , fcnc or charged higgs bosons ) , but also provides a direct handle on the @xmath53 ckm matrix element . in the t - channel , which has the biggest cross section ,",
    "2400 events are selected with an optimized selection ( @xmath54 ) , which allows the cross section to be determined with an accuracy of @xmath55 for @xmath29 of data .",
    "the s- and tw - channels have been investigated as well . there , the estimated uncertainties are larger .",
    "due to the large cross sections , the cms experiment will be able to make important measurements of @xmath0 boson and top quark production already with the first lhc data .",
    "these measurements not only constrain standard model parameters and determine backgrounds to many new physics signals , but are also very useful as detector commissioning tools and calibration candles ."
