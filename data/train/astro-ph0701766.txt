    "cosmic rays reach the earth at a rate of approximately 1000 s@xmath1 m@xmath2 . their energy spectrum is steeply falling and remarkably featureless over ten orders of magnitude in energy @xcite .",
    "the differential flux is well described by a power law ( @xmath3 ) with a steepening of the spectrum at a few pev ( the so - called `` knee '' ) and a flattening around 10 eev ( the so - called `` ankle '' ) . despite advances in the field ,",
    "the origin of cosmic rays is still unresolved .",
    "supernova explosions are thought to be the major contributor at energies up to 1 pev @xcite , but conclusive proof is still missing .",
    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) @xcite has clearly identified supernova shock waves as sources of high - energy particles @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of these particles  electrons or cosmic - ray nucleons  remains under debate .",
    "the elemental composition of cosmic rays is similar to the composition of the solar system , if one accounts for propagation effects through the galaxy @xcite . at present",
    "the best measurements of elemental spectra in the energy range 1 gev to 0.5 pev come from long duration balloon flights @xcite . because of the decreasing flux of cosmic rays and the limited collection area of these experiments ( @xmath41 m@xmath0 ) , it is hard to extend such measurements to higher energies .",
    "a further improvement in the accuracy and energy range of composition measurements could provide crucial information about the acceleration mechanism and propagation of these particles , and therefore provide further clues about their origin .    in 2001 , kieda et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new method for the measurement of cosmic rays with _ * * i**maging * * a**tmospheric * * c**herenkov * * t**elescopes _ ( iacts ) .",
    "the central idea of this method is to detect the cherenkov light emitted by _",
    "primary _ cosmic - ray particles ( so - called _ * * d**irect * * c**herenkov light _ ) from the ground . while dc - light has been measured in the past by balloon experiments @xcite , the measurement from the ground takes advantage of the huge detection area ( @xmath4@xmath5 m@xmath0 ) of iacts , in principle enabling the extension of spectral and composition measurements up to @xmath6 1 pev . here",
    "we review this technique and describe its application to data from h.e.s.s .",
    "we present the measurement of the iron spectrum and give an outlook on future applications of this method .          when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere they emit cherenkov light above an element - dependent energy threshold .",
    "the cherenkov angle increaces with the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "the emission angle of the dc - light therefore increases with increasing depth of the primary particle in the atmosphere , creating a light cone on the ground with a radius of roughly 100 m ( see fig . [ sketch ] ) . at a typical height of 30 km",
    "the particle interacts and a particle cascade is induced ( extensive air shower , eas ) .",
    "the cherenkov light from these secondary particles creates a second , wider , light cone on the ground .    .",
    "the drop in dc - intensity at 100/120 m reflects the first interaction height .",
    "the low intensity tail at larger radii is caused by cherenkov light from fragments of the primary nucleus.,width=340 ]    the intensity of the dc - light is proportional to the square of the charge z of the emitting particle , and can therefore be used to identify the primary particle .",
    "the challenge for detecting dc - light is to distinguish it from the much brighter eas - light background ( fig .",
    "[ intground ] ) .",
    "because the dc - light is emitted higher in the atmosphere , it is emitted at a smaller angle than the eas - light , and is therefore imaged closer to the shower direction in the camera plane . a typical emission angle for dc - light is @xmath7 to @xmath8 , whereas most of the eas - light is emitted at angles greater @xmath9 from the direction of the primary particle ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "cherenkov cameras , with pixel sizes of @xmath10 are therefore able to resolve the dc - emission as a single bright pixel between the reconstructed shower direction and the _ center of gravity _ ( cog ) of the eas - image in the camera plane ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .    unfortunately , the number of emitted dc - photons also depends on the emission height and on the energy of the primary particle ( fig .",
    "[ nphot ] ) .",
    "the height of first interaction of hadrons typically varies between 20 to 40 km , hence the total amount of emitted dc - photons of particles with the same atomic number and energy varies significantly .",
    "as will be discussed later , this makes the estimation of the primary charge more difficult .    , calculated using an atmospheric profile appropriate for the h.e.s.s .",
    "site.,width=340 ]    the energy range to which this technique can be applied depends on the charge of the primary particle @xcite . at lower energies",
    "the limiting factor is that the primary particle momentum must exceed the cherenkov threshold .",
    "at very high energies , the eas - light outshines the dc - light , making the detection of the latter impossible .",
    "the reason for this is that the intensity of the eas - light increases approximately linearly with energy , whereas the amount of emitted dc - photons remains basically constant above a certain energy ( see fig .",
    "[ nphot ] ) .",
    "the aim of the current work is to demonstrate that the technique of dc - light detection can be applied to instruments such as h.e.s.s . to measure the flux of cosmic - ray iron nuclei .",
    "because of their large atomic number and high flux compared to other heavy elements , iron nuclei are well suited for dc - light detection .",
    "the lower energy threshold for the detection of these nuclei is @xmath11 tev .",
    "the h.e.s.s . instrument used for this measurement consists of four iacts situated in the khomas highland of namibia , at a height of 1830 m above see level . each telescope is equipped with a 960 pixel camera .",
    "each pixel has an angular diameter of @xmath12 , providing a total field of view of 5@xmath13 diameter .",
    "the four telescopes are triggered in coincidence and image the cherenkov light from eass .",
    "the exact trigger conditions can be found in @xcite and are far below the applied analysis cuts described in the next section . as will also be described there ,",
    "the properties of the primary particle ( such as direction or energy ) can be reconstructed from the shower images .",
    "h.e.s.s . is a @xmath14-ray experiment .",
    "the main challenge in detecting @xmath14-rays is to distinguish them from the much larger background of hadronic cosmic rays ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this background , recorded during normal @xmath14-ray observations , is now used to search for events with dc - light .",
    "as for the standard h.e.s.s .",
    "analysis , the raw shower images are calibrated @xcite and the pixel intensities are corrected to account for the loss of optical efficiency of the system over time @xcite .",
    "afterwards the images are cleaned to remove low intensity substructure in the shower images and hence improve shower reconstruction . the image cleaning consists of a two - staged tail - cut , which requires pixels to have an intensity greater than 20 ( 10 ) photo - electrons ( pe ) and a neighboring pixel with an intensity of 10 ( 20 ) pe .",
    "afterwards , an `` island cleaning '' is applied , where all pixels that are not connected to the pixel with the maximum intensity by neighboring pixels are removed . for a further reduction of shower fluctuations",
    "the same procedure is applied again with stronger cuts ( 200 and 100 pe ) . by default",
    "the soft - cleaned images are used for the shower reconstruction .",
    "the strong - cleaned images are only used instead if they contain more than 7 pixels in more than two camera images .",
    "the showers are reconstructed using the standard _",
    "stereoscopic hillas analysis _",
    "@xcite , whereby the shower ( and therefore particle ) direction and the intersection point of the shower axis on the ground are reconstructed by intersecting the major axes of the different shower images .",
    "the energy of the primary particles is reconstructed from the total image intensity @xmath15 , the impact parameter @xmath16 ( perpendicular distance from the shower axis to the telescope ) and the zenith angle @xmath17 , by comparing these parameters to simulations . the mean eas - light yield at a fixed energy varies with the atomic number of the primary particle , which introduces a systematic shift in the energy reconstruction between different elements . in this analysis",
    "all energies are reconstructed under the assumption that the primary particle is an iron nucleus .",
    "this energy reconstruction technique leads to a systematic bias close to the energy threshold for detection @xcite .",
    "therefore only events with a reconstructed energy greater than 13 tev were considered , for which the energy bias is less than 5% ( the exact energy value is 12.59 tev , which corresponds to @xmath18 and will always be referred to as 13 tev in the following ) . additionally , to avoid images truncated at the camera edge , only images with a center of gravity less than 2@xmath13 from camera center",
    "are used . finally , to select well reconstructed showers , only events that contain at least two camera images with an _ aspect ratio _",
    "smaller than 0.75 ( _ aspect ratio _",
    "@xmath19 ) were considered .",
    "dc - light can be identified as a single high intensity pixel between the reconstructed shower direction and the cog of the eas - shower in the camera images ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "the main selection parameter for finding this dc - pixel in the camera image is the _ dc - ratio _ , defined as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the maximum intensity of the neighboring pixels .",
    "the pixel with the minimum @xmath22 is determined in the relevant angular region in each camera image .",
    "the parameters used to constrain this region are the angular distance from the dc - pixel to the shower direction ( @xmath23 ) , to the cog of the eas ( @xmath24 ) and to the line connecting these two points ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "afterwards a selection on the impact parameter is applied to ensure that the telescope is inside the dc - light cone . finally , to avoid detector saturation effects",
    ", the intensity of the dc - light candidate pixel @xmath26 has to be below the saturation intensity .",
    "the exact cut values for the identification of a dc - pixel were optimized using iron simulations and are summarized in table [ cuts ] .",
    ".cut parameters for dc - pixel detection . for definitions of the parameters see text . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first step in the derivation of the flux of iron nuclei is the measurement of fraction @xmath27 of iron events among the dc - events .",
    "@xmath27 is estimated via a fit of a two - component model to the @xmath28 distribution of the data .",
    "the first component of this model is the @xmath28 distribution of simulated iron nuclei .",
    "the second component is a sum of the @xmath28 distribution of lighter nuclei .",
    "the relative composition of the lighter charge bands (= all except the iron band ) is kept fixed to the reference composition , so that @xmath27 is the single free parameter of the fit .",
    "the fit was performed in five energy bands .",
    "the @xmath28 distribution from the data and the fitted model using sibyll simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ figfits ] .",
    "the fit results ( @xmath27 ) and corresponding @xmath29 values ( @xmath30 ) for the fits are summarized in the table [ fitresults ] for qgsjet and sibyll .",
    "the values for @xmath27 for the two hadronic models agree with each other within statistical errors @xmath31 ( the standard deviation of the fit result ) for individual energy bands .",
    "however , the qgsjet values are shifted by @xmath4 - 0.1 .",
    "apart from statistical uncertainties , @xmath27 is affected by the systematic uncertainty in the assumed composition of the lighter nuclei @xmath32 .",
    "this is estimated by varying the weight of the individual lighter charge bands of the fitted model by 25% and performing the fit for each possible combination .",
    "the minimum and maximum deviation between these fit results and the previously obtained @xmath27 value are then taken as errors on the composition uncertainty .",
    "since these errors are close to symmetric , their absolute values are averaged to give @xmath32 .",
    "table [ fitresults ] also shows the expected iron fractions @xmath33 from simulations of the cosmic - ray flux assuming the reference composition .",
    "these values agree with the best fit values .",
    "this implies , together with the reasonable @xmath34 values of the fits , that no significant deviation from the reference composition can be found in the data . for the iron band",
    "this statement will be quantified in the next section .",
    "since the identification of dc - events is effectively background - free , the differential iron flux @xmath35 can be estimated as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of detected dc - events in the energy interval from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the total live - time of the data - set and @xmath41 is the mean effective area times the field of view of the detector , averaged over the zenith angle of the observations , taking into account the efficiency of selection cuts .",
    "@xmath41 is derived from simulations of iron nuclei via : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number of simulated events in the energy interval from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and @xmath44 is the corresponding number of identified dc - events . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the area and angular region over which the simulations were performed",
    ".    the energy spectrum is measured in the five energy bins of the @xmath27 fit .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ figspectrum ] for both hadronic models together with the highest energy baloon measurements .",
    "the derived spectrum agrees well with these measurements for both models .",
    "the measured spectrum is fitted well by a power law @xmath47 .",
    "the best fit values for the sibyll spectrum are given by @xmath48 m@xmath2sr@xmath1 tev@xmath1 and @xmath49 with an @xmath29/ndf of 3.0/3 .",
    "for the qgsjet spectrum the best fit values are @xmath50 m@xmath2sr@xmath1 tev@xmath1 and @xmath51 with @xmath29/ndf of 5.3/3 .",
    "the integrated flux above 13 tev is @xmath52 s@xmath1sr@xmath1 m@xmath1 for sibyll and @xmath53 s@xmath1sr@xmath1m@xmath1 for qgsjet .",
    "since both spectra are derived using the same data - set , the differences in the spectral index @xmath54 and integrated flux @xmath55 again provide an estimate of the systematic error due to hadronic interaction uncertainties .",
    "additional systematic errors , arising from uncertainties in the atmospheric profile and the absolute detection efficiency of the h.e.s.s .",
    "instrument are discussed in detail in @xcite and lead to a systematic error of 20% in the integrated flux and @xmath56 in the spectral index .",
    "the effect of the systematic error @xmath32 in @xmath27 on the spectrum amounts to @xmath57 and @xmath58 . assuming a more conservative error of 50% in the integral fluxes of the lighter elements in the model of the @xmath27 fit increases @xmath32 by 0.03 on average and leads to errors of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the presented spectrum .",
    "this error is still small compared to the previously mentioned uncertainties . the total systematic uncertainty of the measurement is therefore estimated to @xmath61 for the spectral index and @xmath62 for the integrated flux .",
    "the statistical error on the measured iron flux is comparable to these systematic errors .",
    "this means that without an improvement in the latter , the total error of the measurement can not be significantly reduced by increasing the exposure time of the data set .",
    "however , an increased data - set would enable one to extend the measurement towards higher energies .",
    "we note that , despite the systematic uncertainties , the iron flux determined with this technique is one of the best measurements in this energy range . the good agreement between the measured fluxes from balloon experiments and those given here lends confidence to the results from both techniques .",
    "a technique for the detection of cosmic rays by resolving the cherenkov emission from primary particles has been presented and applied to h.e.s.s . data . as a result 1899",
    "events with direct cherenkov light in at least two telescopes were detected and it was shown that these dc - events can be considered as background - free .",
    "different parameter distributions of these events were compared to simulations using two different hadronic interaction models and good agreement with the data was found for both .",
    "the strong correlation between the dc - light and the charge of the primary shower particle made a charge estimate possible , from which the energy dependent fraction of iron in the data was derived .",
    "the energy spectrum of iron nuclei was determined in an energy range of 13 to 200 tev .",
    "the result confirms the flux measurements from balloon experiments with an independent technique and is one of the most precise measurements in this energy range .",
    "future improvements of the dc - light technique could extend the energy range of the measurement to an energy of @xmath63 pev .",
    "besides larger statistics , this extension requires additional separation power of the dc - light from the eas - light .",
    "the reason for this is that the dc - light yield remains constant above a certain energy while the eas light yield increases approximately linearly with energy .",
    "as shown in @xcite , additional separation power can be achieved using the time structure of the dc - light , since it arrives with a typical delay of 4 ns with respect to the eas light .",
    "this fact could not be exploited in the analysis presented because the h.e.s.s .",
    "data used here were taken with the standard integration window of 16 ns . however",
    ", current and planned cherenkov telescopes , which routinely store pulse timing information @xcite , may take advantage of this characteristic",
    ".    due to the strong dependence of the dc - light yield on the charge of the primary particle , the dc - light technique has great potential for composition measurements .",
    "the limiting factor is currently the accuracy of shower reconstruction , needed to constrain the emission height of the dc - light .",
    "since the typical shower images in the present work contain @xmath6100 pixels , the limitation in the reconstruction accuracy of the shower with the hillas technique arises from the strong fluctuations in hadronic showers and not from the limited angular resolution of the system .",
    "this puts a physical limit to the charge resolution when the showers are reconstructed using this technique .    in order to reduce the sensitivity",
    "to shower fluctuations , the dc - light itself could in principle be used to reconstruct the shower .",
    "one simple extension of the current method would be to determine the principal axes of the shower images as the line connecting the center of gravity of the image to the dc - pixel .",
    "however , exploitation of this technique would require pixels with smaller angular scale for the accurate localization of the dc - light spot .",
    "another possibility , with an array of many nearby telescopes , would be to reconstruct the shower from the dc - light intensity distribution on the ground .",
    "both techniques would take advantage of the very small fluctuations of the dc - emission .",
    "a quantitative statement on the level of improvement for both techniques would require detailed simulations and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , the agreement of the distribution of the reconstructed charge @xmath28 for large charges ( @xmath64 ) disfavors a significant contribution from ultra heavy elements to the cosmic - ray flux , as expected .",
    "it should also be noted that the present analysis is not sensitive to exotic states of matter , such as _ quark matter _ or _",
    "magnetic monopoles _ as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the high charges of these states ( @xmath65 ) imply dc - intensities which would saturate the photomultipliers in the h.e.s.s .",
    "cameras .",
    "the support of the namibian authorities and of the university of namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of h.e.s.s .",
