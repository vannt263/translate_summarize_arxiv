    "the influence of electromagnetic field on relativistic relativistic stellar objects has been an area of research interest for many decades .",
    "the topic has got a renewed attention in the recent past due to the fact that many observed pulsars have been estimated to have huge electric fields .",
    "although astrophysical systems are expected to be globally charge neutral , at certain evolutionary stages , a charged astrophysical object might exist .",
    "it is noteworthy that collapse of a star to a point singularity may be avoided by incorporating charge in its composition since the gravitational attraction will then be counter balanced by the coulomb repulsion . in a binary pulsar system",
    "a star may acquire a net charge by accretion from the surrounding medium to form a charged sphere @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out by usov @xcite that in ultra - compact stars like ` strange stars ' composed of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks , the electric field at the surface could be as high as @xmath4 .",
    "physical behavior of such astrophysical systems can be studied by solving the relevant einstein - maxwell system .",
    "the exterior spacetime of a static charged spherically symmetric object is uniquely described by the reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "the interior solution of such a system is , however , not unique and a large class of physically motivated realistic solutions are available in the literature as can be found in a compilation work of ivanov @xcite .",
    "physically motivated models of charged fluid / dust spheres have been developed and analyzed by many researchers over the years . physical behavior and stability of charged dust",
    "have been carried out by papapetrou @xcite , majumdar @xcite , bonner @xcite , to name a few .",
    "stettner @xcite has shown that a homogeneous fluid sphere with a considerable amount of net surface charge is more stable than that of an uncharged sphere .",
    "bekenstein @xcite studied the dynamics and stability of spherical symmetric systems by generalizing the oppenheimer - volkoff equations of hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite and obtained a maximum limit on the electric field that the charged sphere might sustain .",
    "cooperstock and cruz @xcite found a new solution for a uniformly distributed charged dust in equilibrium .",
    "bonner and wickramasuriya @xcite proposed a charged stellar model showing radially increasing matter density .",

    "relativistic compact stars in equilibrium in the presence of charge have been studied by ray @xcite and ghezzi @xcite . by proposing specific analytic solutions to charged fluid objects , whitman and burch @xcite have discussed stability of such objects .",
    "pant and sah @xcite obtained exact solutions to the einstein - maxwell system for a charged fluid distribution which allowed them to regain the tolman iv solution as a particular case by switching off the charge contribution .",
    "later , pant and sah @xcite solution was generalized by tikekar @xcite who analyzed physical viability of the new class of solutions . by assuming a particular charge intensity profile ,",

    "have been developed where one makes use of the vaidya - tikekar ansatz @xcite .",
    "similarly , the finch - skea ansatz @xcite has also been utilized by many authors ( see for example , @xcite ) to develop realistic stellar models . in this work , making use of the finch - skea ansatz @xcite , we propose a new solution to the einstein - maxwell system corresponding to a spherically symmetric charged sphere",

    "[ sec4 ] , by imposing necessary regularity conditions , we have studied physical features of the system and analyzed the impact of electromagnetic field on the gross properties of the star , the @xmath0 relationship in particular .",
    "we assume that the interior spacetime of a static spherically symmetric star is described by the metric @xmath6 the physical behavior of the star can be understood by solving the einstein - maxwell field equations @xmath7 where , the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to matter and electromagnetic fields are respectively given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 in eqs .",

    "+ to examine whether the developed model is regular , well - behaved and capable of describing realistic stars , we have considered the data of the pulsar @xmath70 whose mass and radius have recently been estimated to be @xmath71 and @xmath72 km , respectively @xcite . using these values as inputs in our model , we have determined the values of the other model parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath35 .",
    "the obtained values ( @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 ; @xmath79 for @xmath76 and @xmath80 for @xmath78 ) have been used to show graphically in fig .",

    "we have also calculated the adiabatic index in our model by using the relation @xmath82 note that for the developed stellar configuration to be stable it is expected that @xmath83 should be greater than @xmath84 @xcite . in our model , this condition puts a restriction on @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "variation of the adiabatic index for both the charged and uncharged cases has been shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "we observe a marginal decrease in the values of @xmath83 near the center for a charged sphere as compared to its neutral counterpart .",
    "the surface redshift @xmath87 also decreases when charge is incorporated into the system as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:7 ] ) . radial variation of charge @xmath88",
    "has been shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:8 ] ) which shows that the maximum deposition of charge occurs near the boundary of the star .",
    "finally , for an assumed value of the surface density ( @xmath89gm  @xmath90 ) , we have shown the mass - radius ( @xmath0 ) relationship in this model for @xmath76 and @xmath91 in fig .",
    "( [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "this has been done in the following way . for a given surface density ,",
    "we have fixed the radius @xmath92 in terms of the curvature parameter @xmath35 and used the same value of @xmath92 in the junction conditions to determine the mass @xmath61 .",
    "the parametric representation of @xmath92 and @xmath61 in terms of @xmath35 has allowed us to plot the @xmath0 relationship which has been shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that inclusion of charge can accommodate more mass within a stellar configuration . in other words ,",
    "compactness of a star increases in the presence of charge .",
    "by considering the finch - skea @xcite ansatz and a particular choice of electric field intensity , we have found a non - singular solution of the einstein - maxwell system , satisfying all regularity conditions .",
    "stability condition puts a bound on the electric field intensity parameter @xmath85 = @xmath93 $ ] in this model .",
    "one noticeable feature of the model is that in presence of charge , both density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 take lower values as compared to uncharged configurations .",
    "the surface redshift in the charged case appears to be less than that of the uncharged case . in our work , we have analyzed of the mass - radius ( m - r ) relationship of the model which , in general , is obtained by integrating the tov equations for a given eos . in the present study , even though we have not specified any eos of the matter composition , we have been able to generate the @xmath0 relationship by choosing a particular surface density .",
    "we note that , in the presence of charge , stellar configurations can accommodate more mass .",
    "it should be stressed here that even though most of the observed pulsar masses are clustered around @xmath94 , a wide range of values of masses and radii of a large class of pulsars are available for which we still do not have any proper theoretical understanding .",
    "our study shows that in classical gravity , electromagnetic field can be used as a tool to fine - tune the mass vis - a - vis compactness of observed pulsars .",

    "<S> the model has been developed by assuming a particular charge distribution within the stellar interior . </S>",
    "<S> the model is well behaved and can describe a large class of compact stars . </S>",
    "<S> physical features of the model are studied and in particular we show how the presence of charge can have a non - negligible impact on the mass - radius ( @xmath0 ) relationship of such class of stars . </S>"
