    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) order - disorder transition discovered here must have profound consequences for all material properties , including degradation propensity , and it can be experimentally verified by scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , temperature - dependent polarized raman measurements , specific heat measurements , among other methods .",
    "the degeneracy of the structural ground state at zero temperature is generic to all monolayers having a _ pnma _ structure , and it is discussed within the context of a ges monolayer ( figure  1 ) next .",
    "the first source of degeneracy seen on the elastic energy landscape @xcite ( figure  1(a ) ) stems from the fact that the elastic energy the total energy at zero temperature as a function of lattice parameters @xmath22) is degenerate upon exchange of @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath23 .",
    "the degeneracy is highlighted with star - like patterns at ground states @xmath11 ( located at ( 4.34 ,3.73  ) ) and @xmath12 ( at ( 3.73 ,4.34  ) ) where @xmath13 . the second source of degeneracy , illustrated on figure  1(b ) , arises from the two mirror - symmetric black zig - zag patterns that can be created by the basis vectors .",
    "( the lower sublayer was white - colored on the structural models to make the patterns more evident . )    the four degenerate structural ground states @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 on figure  1(b ) occur when specific triads of atoms 1 - 0 - 2 , 3 - 0 - 4 , 3 - 0 - 1 , or 4 - 0 - 2 create nearest - neighbor bonds , and this in - plane bond structure can be identified with four in - plane arrows : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26,@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "these atoms form an extra bond to the lower sublayer making the structure three - fold coordinated , but that lower layer reassigns bonds in a similar manner making a discussion of its rearrangement unnecessary .",
    "it is possible to reassign a nearest - neighbor bond at zero temperature ( or to turn arrows by @xmath28 ) by means of the elastic distortion shown by the white dashed curve on figure  1(a ) that converts ground state @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) with bonding atoms 1 - 0 - 2 ( 3 - 0 - 4) onto ground state @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , where atoms 1 - 0 - 3 ( 4 - 0 - 2 ) bond .",
    "indeed , the distortion highlighted by the dashed white curve on figure  1(a ) includes the saddle point @xmath14 where all 4 atoms bond to atom 0 , turning the original zig - zag structure onto an _",
    "unstable cmcm _",
    "`` checkerboard '' structure with an energy cost @xmath0 . when the bond to the lower plane is included , this checkerboard structure is five - fold coordinated .",
    "the structure must loose some bonds as the elastic deformation along the white dashed path continues from point @xmath14 to point @xmath12 , being equally likely to turn into decorations @xmath18 or @xmath19 which are both three - fold coordinated .",
    "this is how bonds are reassigned at zero temperature .",
    "when the lower sublayer ( seen in white on figure 1(b ) ) is considered , one sees that two chemical bonds are reassigned per unit cell when structure @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) turns onto structure @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "direct transitions from decoration @xmath16 ( @xmath24 ) to decoration @xmath17 ( @xmath25 ) ( @xmath18 ( @xmath26 ) onto @xmath19 ( @xmath27 ) ) are more costly as they require reassigning twice as many bonds : 1 - 0 - 2 to 3 - 0 - 4 ( or 3 - 0 - 1 to 4 - 0 - 2 ) , or a @xmath29arrow rotation on figure  1(b ) . these transitions can be achieved in two elastic cycles ( for instance , from @xmath24 to @xmath27 , back to @xmath25 ) , and two - ended red arrows on figure  1(b ) indicate most likely transitions among the four structural ground states .",
    "the reassignment of nearest - neighbors is at the core of the 2d disorder to be discussed later on .      the average atomic number @xmath31 is defined as follows : @xmath32 where the sum is over the four atomic elements on a unit cell , each having atomic number @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it will be shown that both @xmath35 and @xmath0 evolve with @xmath31 now .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 was determined through stringent calculations with the _ vasp _ code @xcite whose details are provided as supporting information . as indicated previously , car - parrinello md calculations will also be necessary to verify our main claim , and these calculations are prohibitively expensive on any computational code that employs plane - wave sets . for that reason @xmath0",
    "was also computed with the _ siesta _ code @xcite , as that code will permit carrying out md calculations at the expense of making a choice for the localized basis set in which electronic wavefunctions are to be expanded .",
    "our choice of basis set , described in the methods section , is such that the magnitude of the lattice constant for bp agrees reasonably well among these two computational tools .",
    "the values of @xmath35 and @xmath0 averaged over their magnitude from three different calculations are displayed in figure 2 and table 1 ( see methods ) .",
    "light compounds such as bp or sis monolayers ( @xmath36 ) have the largest values of @xmath35 and @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , ultrathin pb - based monochalcogenides ( @xmath37 ) have a rock - salt structure so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 . all remaining monochalcogenide monolayers ( mms ) have values of @xmath35 and @xmath0 lying somewhere in between , which implies a vast tunability of @xmath35 and @xmath0 with atomic number .",
    "bond covalency is gradually sacrificed with increasing atomic number to favor a higher atomistic coordination and a weaker ( i.e. , metallic ) bonding . in previous work",
    ", we showed that group - iv two - dimensional materials turn from a threefold- to a ninefold - coordinated phase with increasing atomic number @xcite . in the present case",
    ", a threefold - coordinated structure evolves towards a fivefold - coordinated one with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "being more specific , @xmath40 decays quite rapidly with @xmath31 and regardless of the numerical approach employed .",
    "we fit : @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and display this trendline as the solid curve on figure 2(a ) .",
    "the decrease of the ratio @xmath35 with increasing atomic number implies that the energy needed to reach the intermediate state @xmath14 with @xmath44 by an elastic distortion is becoming smaller with @xmath31 too , and using values of @xmath0 from table 1 one fits : @xmath45 with numerical parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( this trendline is shown as a straight line in figure 2(b ) ) .     among orthogonal in - plane",
    "lattice constants decreases exponentially with the mean atomic number @xmath31 , and ( b ) @xmath0 decays exponentially with @xmath31 as well .",
    "@xmath48 k ( and @xmath49 ) for @xmath50 , prompting the question whether three - fold coordinated gese , sns and snse monolayers are disordered near room temperature . structures with @xmath51 display a five - fold - coordinated and non - degenerate ground state with @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath0 decays exponentially with the average atomic number @xmath31 ( equation  [ 2 ] on the main text ) .",
    "data scatter arises from the fact that three numerical codes were employed in computing these quantities ( see methods ) .",
    "experimental melting temperatures of bulk samples are also included for comparison purposes@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as shown in figure 3(c ) , the onset of the transition is dictated by reassignment of nearest neighbors .",
    "reassignment occurs as the atomistic structure explores the four degenerate ground states displayed in figure 1(b ) once temperature reaches a magnitude similar to @xmath4 .",
    "reassignment leads to the macroscopic increase ( decrease ) of the average local lattice parameter along the vertical ( horizontal ) direction ( see figure 1(b ) ) as local strain is released , and hence onto a macroscopic structure in which @xmath53 .",
    "bp and sise do preserve the magnitude of the ratio @xmath54 to a large extent , which is consistent with their values of @xmath0 equal to 5519@xmath5575 k and 730@xmath55221 k , respectively ( table 1 ) . as seen qualitatively on figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) , these compounds do preserve their original two - dimensional _ pnma _ structure until they melt . on the other side of the energy scale set by @xmath0 ,",
    "pbs has @xmath56 , which is consistent with its magnitude of @xmath39 k. all other materials listed in table 2 are predicted to undergo a 2d order - disorder transition before melting .",
    "indeed , ges displays a drastic decrease of @xmath54 in between 300 k and 1000 k ( its magnitude drops from @xmath57 down to @xmath58 ) . this significant drop in between these two temperatures is consistent with a transition temperature of the order of @xmath59 k displayed in table 1 .",
    "analogously , gese has a sharp decrease on @xmath54 , going from @xmath60 at 300 k , down to @xmath61 at 1000 k. this also means that a two - dimensional order - disorder transition is occurring roughly after 300 k. table 1 predicts a transition temperature close to 300 k ( @xmath62 k ) .",
    "we will be able to determine the exact transition temperature for ges and gese later on .",
    "additionally , sns has @xmath63 k for sns , which implies that a significant drop on @xmath54 must occur in between 30 k and 300 k. accordingly , table 2 points to a decrease from @xmath64 down to @xmath65 in between those temperatures .    according to table 1 ,",
    "gete and snse should transition at temperatures in between 30 k and 300 k. both compounds do show a decrease of @xmath54 in between 30 k and 300 k on the second significant digit , but that decrease is not as drastic as registered with other compounds .",
    "each calculation leading to a datapoint in table 2 consumed about one month of uninterrupted computing , and it appears as if these two compounds may still require additional md steps to reach a smaller ratio . as far as we know , the md tool we employ does not offer a numerically sound way to restart a md calculation .",
    "nevertheless , degeneracies of the ground state lead to mechanical instability at finite temperature @xcite , and we can not think of a physical mechanism that will alter the assumption that gete and snse will continue to reduce their ratio @xmath54 on md runs performed over longer periods of time . the potts model , to be introduced later on , will also help us in bringing all numerical results onto a coarse model that describes all the phenomena observed in our md calculations .",
    "snte presents a different kind of numerical challenges .",
    "this material has a ratio of @xmath54=1.02 at zero k and a barrier @xmath0 roughly larger than 1 mev .",
    "@xmath0 is ( roughly ) the actual energy difference per unit cell between the ordered and disordered phases one is attempting to resolve .",
    "this numerical consideration makes it increasingly challenging to do better on this material : its magnitude of @xmath0 is minuscule in comparison with the other materials listed in table 1 .",
    "a final physical consideration must be added to the discussion of sns , snse , snte , and pbs on table 2 : lattice constants loose their meaning on a molten ( i.e. , non - crystalline ) phase , so the increase on @xmath54 at 1000 k with respect to their magnitude reported at 300 k on these compounds should not be given a heavy weight .",
    "table 2 continues to build the evidence towards a generic 2d order - disorder transition , and we next report the transition temperature @xmath3 for ges and gese through a study of the evolution of energetics and order parameters with an increased temperature resolution .          in figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) we address the thermal evolution of the energy and the order parameter for ges and gese with increased resolution . to proceed with celerity , these md calculations were performed on periodic 8@xmath668 supercells .",
    "the total energy , averaged from 500 to 1,000 fs at a given temperature is labeled @xmath67 , and it has kinetic and configurational ( i.e. , potential ) energy contributions . according to the equipartition theorem , the kinetic energy is proportional to temperature , with @xmath68 the proportionality constant .",
    "this way , the configurational energy @xmath69 displayed for ges and gese in figures  5(a ) and 5(b ) is @xmath70 .",
    "the similar trends on @xmath69 and its thermal derivative obtained for two different mms provides yet additional proof of the generality of the phenomena shown in figures 1 and 2 that leads to the two - dimensional order - disorder transition . in a manner consistent with figure 3 ,",
    "atomistic trajectories from md calculations are given in figure  5(d ) at many temperatures for ges and gese .",
    "incipient reassignments of nearest neighbors , at the onset of the order - disorder transition , are shown as well .",
    "phase transitions lead to drastic changes in the specific heat @xmath71 at zero pressure @xcite .",
    "@xmath69 is a monotonically increasing function of temperature and it has two marked changes of slope that lead to two peaks on the finite - difference temperature derivative @xmath72 in figures  5(a ) and 5(b ) .",
    "these two peaks correspond to phase transitions from a crystalline onto a disordered two - dimensional phase , and from the disordered two - dimensional phase onto a molten phase , respectively .",
    "the focus of this manuscript is on the 2d order - disorder transition . according to figures 5(a ) and 5(b )",
    ", the transition temperature @xmath3 is 510 k for ges ( @xmath73 ) , and at 382 k for gese ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "there is a proportionality among @xmath3 obtained from md calculations ( red vertical lines in figure 5 ) and @xmath75 from table 1 ( shown in a green vertical lines in figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) ) , so that car - parrinello md results do validate the basic intuition drawn from figures 1 and 2 within the limitations in numerical precision from these hero - type , proof - of - concept md calculations .",
    "the order parameter @xmath54 for ges and gese transitions onto a value closer to unity at @xmath3 , a fact that can be better appreciated in the numerical derivative plots @xmath76 shown as the lowermost subplots in figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) .",
    "figure 5 reproduces the magnitudes of this ratio reported in table 2 for larger supercells .",
    "figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) continue to provide further numerical validation to the hypotheses set forth in discussing figures 1 and 2 and demonstrate in an even more convincingly manner the unavoidable disordered nature of mms at finite temperature .",
    "the two - dimensional order - disorder transition is quite relevant for practical room - temperature applications based on mms , and a model that describes it is provided next .      starting with a crystalline structure in which all unit cells have an @xmath16 ( @xmath24 ) decoration , a local energy penalty equal to @xmath77 ( @xmath78 )",
    "is given to a neighboring unit cell that reassigns two bonds in acquiring the @xmath18 ( @xmath26 ) or the @xmath19 ( @xmath27 ) decoration .",
    "a direct transition from a @xmath16 ( @xmath24 ) to a @xmath17 ( @xmath25 ) decoration requires reassigning four bonds , and is thus given an energy penalty equal to @xmath79 .",
    "this prescription leads to a 2d ( clock ) potts model with @xmath20 states @xcite whose dynamical behavior is characterized by an in - plane spin hamiltonian on a square lattice with the following nearest - neighbor coupling : @xmath80 in previous equation , @xmath81 and @xmath82 can take any of the four ( @xmath20 ) values 0 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath83 ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath84 ( @xmath25 ) , or @xmath85 ( @xmath26 ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "the transition with energy penalty @xmath77 becomes dominant , and the system behaves as if there was just a single coupling .",
    "figure  5(c ) displays the predictions from the model , which reproduces the temperature dependence of the configurational energy @xmath86 and @xmath54 from car - parrinello md , a remarkable agreement in light of the simplicity of the model and the complexity of the _ ab - initio _ calculations : potts model provides an appealingly simple physical picture for the 2d order - disorder transition .",
    "it is impossible to sample larger cells with the _ ab - initio _ method , so potts model was employed to increase sampling statistics which leads to domain sizes shown in figure  6 on supercells containing @xmath87 unit cells , corresponding to an area of @xmath88 nm@xmath89 . at @xmath90",
    "it is highly unlikely to see domains with arrows pointing in opposite directions along the same direction due to the higher energy cost required to create such configuration , and intriguing ` vortex ' configurations can be observed as well .",
    "structural disorder implies the existence of electronic disorder .",
    "indeed , the electronic wavefunctions below and above the fermi energy seen in figure  7 for disordered 2d snse exhibit drastic changes at room temperature when contrasted with their appearance in a crystalline structure .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]    valleytronics , piezoelectricity , and shift photovoltaics applications @xcite have been predicted for fully crystalline phases ; the results provided here thus constrain the choice of materials for these applications near room temperature . at a fundamental level , it will be interesting to explore how these predictions become altered in the presence of 2d disorder , something that is the subject of forthcoming work .",
    "in summary , the ridged structure of black phosphorus and of layered monochalcogenides leads to 2d disorder as in - plane nearest - neighbors become reassigned at finite temperature .",
    "a second transition from this disordered 2d lattice onto a gas phase occurs at a larger temperature , with the remarkable exception of a bp monolayer which has no visible signs of breakdown at 1,000 k so that it will directly melt from the 2d crystalline structure .",
    "transition temperatures equal to 510 and 382 k were determined for ges and gese , respectively .",
    "the phenomena was demonstrated with state - of - the - art large - scale molecular dynamics calculations on periodic supercells , with all relevant interactions computed at the _ ab initio _ level .",
    "an analogy among bond reassignment and four orientations of an arrow leads to a minimal description of the observed phenomena by a potts model that has @xmath91 as its single parameter .",
    "this model describes the full - scale energetics through the 2d order - disorder transition remarkably well .",
    "the generic results presented here call to investigate the properties recently predicted on crystalline samples ( valleytronics , shift - current photovoltaics , and piezoelectronics ) @xcite as 2d disorder sets in ; something that will be pursued in forthcoming work . having @xmath92",
    "k , ges monolayers appear as the proper crystalline material platform already available in the bulk form for the pursuit of mm - based applications that require crystallinity of the 2d lattice at room temperature .",
    "these results apply to freestanding monolayers , and it may be possible to raise the magnitude of the transition temperature @xmath3 , through thermal coupling to a substrate or in the bulk .",
    "the predictions contained here illustrate classic results from the theory of phase transitions and disorder in two - dimensions at work in this novel family of 2d atomic materials .",
    "density - functional theory calculations with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite and the van der waals berland - per hyldgaard ( bh ) @xcite exchange - correlation functionals were carried out on unit cells containing four atoms to determine the elastic energy barrier @xmath0 in table 1 , with the _ vasp _ @xcite ( pbe , method 1 ) and _ siesta _ @xcite codes ( pbe , method 2 ; and bh , method 3 ) .",
    "this required a dedicated deployment of pseudopotentials for the _ siesta _ code for most of the chemical elements employed in this work @xcite . according to reference",
    "@xcite the bh pseudopotential produces accurate lattice constants and bulk moduli of layered materials and tightly bound solids .",
    "all calculations on single unit cells leading to @xmath0 on table 1 were performed with a 18@xmath6618@xmath661 k - point sampling .",

    "in addition , the electronic density was converged down to 5@xmath93 .",
    "car - parrinello md calculations with method 3 at constant temperature and zero pressure were carried out with the _ siesta _ code at temperatures of 30 , 300 , and 1,000 k for one thousand steps ( with a 1fs time step ) on periodic supercells containing 576 atoms .",
    "these calculations employed a single k - point , a reduced mesh cutoff of 200 ry , and a reduced tolerance on the electronic cycle of 10@xmath94 , and require about a full month to end for a given temperature , running on 128 processors .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the total energy as a function of temperature for ges and gese monolayers was performed on smaller periodic @xmath95 supercells containing 256 atoms , still employing a single k - point , a reduced mesh cutoff of 200 ry , and a reduced tolerance on the electronic cycle of 10@xmath94 .",

    "the average lattice constants @xmath96 and @xmath97 were obtained for nine compounds from the distances among each of the four atoms on a given unit cell with respect to the position of said basis atoms in neighboring unit cells once thermal equilibrium was reached , leading to an average over 12@xmath6612@xmath66500 individual values from _ siesta _ calculations with bh pseudopotentials that is reported up to three significant digits . by definition @xmath98 and @xmath99 on the crystalline structures at 0 k , whose values were then obtained from single unit cell calculations .",

    "<S> ridged , orthorhombic two - dimensional atomic crystals with a bulk _ pnma _ structure such as black phosphorus and monochalcogenide monolayers are an exciting and novel material platform for a host of applications . </S>",
    "<S> key to their crystallinity , monolayers of these materials have a four - fold degenerate structural ground state , and a single energy scale @xmath0 ( representing the elastic energy required to switch the longer lattice vector along the @xmath1 or @xmath2direction ) determines how disordered these monolayers are at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> disorder arises when nearest neighboring atoms become gently reassigned as the system is thermally excited beyond a critical temperature @xmath3 that is proportional to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is tunable by chemical composition and it leads to a classification of these materials into two categories : ( i ) those for which @xmath5 , and ( ii ) those having @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a given material s melting temperature . </S>",
    "<S> black phosphorus and sis monolayers belong to category ( i ) : these materials do not display an intermediate order - disorder transition and melt directly . </S>",
    "<S> all other monochalcogenide monolayers with @xmath8 belonging to class ( ii ) will undergo a two - dimensional transition prior to melting . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is slightly larger than room temperature for ges and gese , and smaller than 300 k for sns and snse monolayers , so that these materials transition near room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of this generic atomistic phenomena is captured by a planar potts model up to the order - disorder transition . </S>",
    "<S> the order - disorder phase transition in two dimensions described here is at the origin of the _ cmcm _ phase being discussed within the context of bulk layered snse . </S>"
