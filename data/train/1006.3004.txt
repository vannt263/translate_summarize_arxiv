    "the discrete nature of vorticity in quantum fluids ( superfluid @xmath0he , @xmath1he and atomic bose ",
    "einstein condensates ) makes it possible to give physical meaning to vortex reconnections .",
    "the importance of vortex reconnections in turbulence can not be overestimated .",
    "reconnections randomise the velocity field thus sustaining the turbulent vortex tangle in a steady state @xcite and changing the flow s topology @xcite . by triggering a kelvin wave cascade @xcite ,",
    "reconnections are responsible for the decay of turbulent kinetic energy at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the vortex reconnection frequency on the observed vortex line density is therefore an important quantity @xcite .    in quantum fluids ,",
    "the existence of vortex reconnections was first conjectured by schwarz @xcite ; it was then theoretically demonstrated by koplik and levine @xcite , and experimentally observed at the university of maryland @xcite using micron - size solid hydrogen tracers trapped in superfluid vortex lines .",
    "more precisely , the maryland investigators inferred the existence of reconnections by the sudden movement of trapped particles . in doing",
    "so they relied on numerical calculations by de waele and aarts @xcite , who reported that the distance between two vortices , @xmath2 , varies as @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the quantum of circulation , @xmath5 is time and @xmath6 is the time of reconnection .",
    "this @xmath7 scaling agrees with the approximate analytic solution of the nonlinear schroedinger equation ( also called the gross  pitaevskii equation , or gpe for short ) found by nazarenko and west @xcite .",
    "de waele and aarts also claimed that , on their way toward a reconnection , the vortices form a universal pyramidal cusp structure which is independent of the initial condition .    the numerical calculations of de waele and aarts @xcite were based on the vortex filament model pioneered by schwarz @xcite , which assumes that the vortex core is much smaller than any other length scale in the problem .",
    "the vortex filament model thus breaks down in the vicinity of a reconnection .",
    "it is therefore instructive to repeat the calculation seeking full numerical solutions of the gpe , which does not suffer such limitation and is a well - known model of superfluidity .",
    "this is indeed what we plan to do in this paper , together with revisiting the claim of universality of the reconnecting pyramidal cusp geometry .",

    "the wavefunction is normalised by the condition that @xmath15 . if we let @xmath16 be the unit of time , @xmath17 the unit of length , and @xmath18 the unit of @xmath19 , we obtain the following dimensionless gpe    @xmath20    we solve eq .",
