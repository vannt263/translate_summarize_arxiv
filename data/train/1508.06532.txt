    "one of the main motivations to study iron - based high - temperature superconductors ( ibs ) is the frequent vicinity of unconventional superconductivity and static magnetism in their phase diagram . also observed in copper - based superconductors , it raises the questions of ground state interplay and of the role of spin fluctuations in the cooper pairing interaction . by applying pressure , changing the doping or altering the electronic structure via isovalent substitutions @xcite ,",
    "the ground state of most ibs can be modified from static magnetism towards superconductivity , with the possibility of ground state coexistence on a microscopic scale in several cases @xcite .",
    "a key aspect of iron - based superconductors is the itinerant , multi - band character of their electronic structure . in compounds such as the 1111 and 122 families , the low - temperature magnetic order of the parent compounds ( @xmath5 for the 1111 family )",
    "is argued to be a spin - density wave caused by the nesting properties of the fermi surface @xcite . as this transition is associated to a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural transition at the same or a slightly - higher temperature , both ising - nematic spin fluctuations and orbital fluctuations",
    "have been invoked to explain the observed anisotropic electronic response of the iron plane above the magnetic transition @xcite .",
    "evolutions of the fermi surface with doping would affect the competition of ground states , and relative changes in interband and intraband scattering would play a role in determining whether superconductivity is associated to spin or orbital fluctuations , yielding respectively a @xmath6 or @xmath7 symmetry of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the ground state competition is , however , complicated by spatial electronic inhomogeneities which derive either from the local effect of in - plane chemical substitutions @xcite , or from intrinsic iron plane physics . using nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) , a local probe of the charge environment , we have previously shown that the fluorine - doped 1111 family ( @xmath0feaso@xmath1f@xmath2 with @xmath0 a rare earth ) features two types of local electronic environments intrinsic to the feas layers when moderately doped @xcite . although these environments are already defined in the paramagnetic state , their simultaneous presence in purely magnetic or purely superconducting samples appears to rule out a trivial explanation of any ground state coexistence in 1111 compounds . further complicating the analysis of ground state interplay",
    ", such coexistence seems dependent on the choice of rare earth ( la , ce , sm  ) @xcite .",
    "obscuring the whole phase diagram is the difficulty in assessing the true doping , which may differ dramatically from the nominal doping depending on the rare earth and the synthesis route @xcite .    in this article , we present how the nanoscale charge environments observed by nqr in the paramagnetic state yield a highly - accurate determination of the effective doping , allowing us to compare unambiguously the phase diagrams of @xmath0feaso@xmath1f@xmath2 ( @xmath0@xmath3la , ce , sm ) and to explain the evolution of ground state properties with doping .",
    "[ str : phasediag ] describes how to obtain such phase diagrams , which are found undistinguishable for the two magnetic rare earths ( ce , sm ) . the different behavior for lanthanum shows that static magnetism from the iron has a detrimental effect on superconductivity , while at high doping la - based samples display a specific , nonmonotonous behavior of the superconducting transition temperature . in sec .",
    "[ str : magnetism ] , it is found that the low - doping - like regions seen by nqr fully account for the orthorhombicity and iron static magnetism of the system .",
    "nearest - neighbor square lattice percolation is at play , with dimensionality being dependent on whether the rare earth itself is magnetic . in sec .",
    "[ str : sc ] , it is shown that the low - doping - like regions can only host superconductivity by proximity , with intrinsic superconductivity originating from the high - doping - like regions seen by nqr . finally , we propose in sec .",
    "[ str : interplay ] a full description of the interplay of ground states in 1111 pnictides , where superconductivity extends spatially whenever static magnetism is weak enough in the nearby microscopic regions .",
    "two different routes were followed for the synthesis of the polycrystalline @xmath0feaso@xmath1f@xmath2 ( @xmath0@xmath3la , ce , sm ) samples . for route 1 , feas was prepared by a solid - state reaction prior to the synthesis of the corresponding 1111 compounds .",
    "subsequently , the resulting feas was mixed with metallic @xmath0 , @xmath8o@xmath9 , and @xmath0f@xmath9 in a stoichiometric ratio .",
    "this mixture was homogenized by grinding in a mortar . for route 2",
    ", we prepared @xmath0as as first step by reacting @xmath0 and as lumps in a stoichiometric ratio via a vapor transport reaction .",
    "the second step of route 2 used the resulting @xmath0as , fe , fe@xmath10o@xmath9 , and fef@xmath9 as starting materials in a stoichiometric ratio . here",
    ", the starting materials were homogenized by grinding in a ball mill . in either case , the resulting powders were pressed into pellets under ar atmosphere , and subsequently annealed in an evacuated quartz tube in a two - step synthesis first at 940@xmath11c for 12  h and then at 1150@xmath11c for up to 60  h. all samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) with semiquantitative elemental analysis using the wavelength dispersive x - ray ( wdx ) mode . their structural properties and their structural , magnetic , and superconducting phase transitions",
    "were determined using a wide array of techniques : standard xrd , synchrotron xrd at low temperature , magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity , muon spin relaxation and rotation ( @xmath12sr ) , mssbauer spectroscopy , and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite .",
    "the determination of the doping will be discussed in the next section , with all phase transitions being included in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag_nqr ] .    in order to probe the distribution of charge environments at the nanometer scale ,",
    "@xmath13as nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) was used .",
    "nqr probes nuclei with spin @xmath14@xmath151/2 , which possess a finite electric quadrupole moment @xmath16 with @xmath17 the elementary charge and @xmath18 the nuclear quadrupole moment . in the absence of",
    "applied or internal magnetic field , any finite electric field gradient ( efg ) at the atomic site will lift at least partially the degeneracy of the nuclear electric quadrupole energy levels , according to the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath19   \\mbox { , }   \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\ ] ] whose coordinate axes are defined by the principal axes of the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor , itself characterized by its largest principal value @xmath20 and its asymmetry parameter @xmath21@xmath3@xmath22 ( @xmath23 and 0@xmath241 ) . since @xmath13as has a nuclear spin @xmath14@xmath33/2 , the hamiltonian yields a single resonance frequency : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is planck s constant .",
    "the electric quadrupole frequency @xmath27 depends on the symmetry and amplitude of the efg , which itself depends on the atomic / nanoscale charge environment . for every local charge environment as seen from the arsenic sites , one resonance line will be observed .",
    "using a standard pulsed nqr spectrometer , radiofrequency irradiations over a typical @xmath28@xmath3814  mhz frequency range were performed to obtain the histogram of resonance frequencies for all arsenic sites in the sample .",
    "powder samples were crushed to ensure that the crystallites are small enough to obtain a good penetration of the radiofrequency field .",
    "note that operating on powders does not affect the spectra , since @xmath29 depends on the principal axes of the local efg , i.e. , the resonance frequency for a given charge environment is independent of the orientation of individual crystallites .",
    "spin echo sequences ( @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 ) were used , with typical @xmath31@xmath32030  @xmath12s .",
    "the @xmath31 values and the pulse sequence repetition rates were checked to be small enough that spin - spin or spin - lattice relaxation contrast do not distort the relative line intensities .",
    "point - by - point spectra were obtained by integrating the full echo and applying a @xmath33 intensity correction .",
    "in most of the published literature , nominal dopings are used to build the phase diagrams of iron - based superconductors .",
    "while this yields qualitatively correct results for a given sample series , it is known that the real doping may be significantly lower , especially for high nominal dopings @xcite .",
    "it is thus difficult to extract quantitative information ( e.g. : doping thresholds ) , and to compare different compounds in terms of ground - state competition and the doping profile of the superconductivity dome . for f - doped 1111 compounds ,",
    "real content determination using wdx spectroscopy is hardly possible for cerium - based compounds due to the superposition of the relevant ce and f lines , and may generally be affected by the presence of poorly - crystallized impurities which xrd can not easily account for . using fluorine nmr ,",
    "the doping could be established within an absolute error of 2% @xcite , which is satisfactory for high dopings but may be imprecise to discuss the boundary between the two ground states at low doping . here , we propose to take advantage of the doping dependence of the charge environments previously seen by nqr for la- and sm - based samples @xcite .          fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows the nqr spectra for @xmath0 - 1111 ( @xmath0 @xmath3 la , ce , sm ) in the paramagnetic state over a broad doping range ( itself determined by nqr as described below , see also tab .",
    "[ tab : nqr ] for the fluorine content ) . whereas undoped and highly - doped samples display a single peak corresponding to a single charge environment , the samples at intermediate doping display two peaks ( two charge environments ) which were shown to correspond to a nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity intrinsic to the feas layers @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) as the low - frequency ( high - frequency ) peak s position and spectral weight ( @xmath36@xmath38@xmath37@xmath31 ) , and @xmath39 as the wdx - established doping , these two charge environments were found to have the following properties : ( i ) the transfer of spectral weight is linear with @xmath39 and is completed ( @xmath40 ) at @xmath39@xmath410.1 ( ii ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 vary linearly with @xmath39 , extrapolating respectively to the frequencies of the @xmath39@xmath30 and @xmath39@xmath30.1 charge environments ( iii ) the linear @xmath39 dependence of @xmath35 appeared to extend beyond @xmath39@xmath30.1 , which was independently confirmed @xcite .",
    "the low- and high - frequency peaks were thus associated to low - doping - like ( ld - like ) and high - doping - like ( hd - like ) regions .",
