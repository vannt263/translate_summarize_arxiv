    "global evolution of protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) is governed by the processes of angular momentum transport and outflow mass loss .",
    "these processes directly control disk structure and evolution , which set the timescales of disk dispersal and hence planet formation ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite for reviews )",
    ". they also strongly affect the evolution of dust grains , which are building blocks of planets , and feedback to disk thermal and chemical structures ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "if planets are formed within the disk lifetime , planet - disk interaction leads to planet migration , which is also sensitive to global disk structure and evolution ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) . in brief",
    ", a reliable global evolutionary picture of ppd is key to understanding most processes of planet formation .",
    "most ppd models used in planet formation research are constructed upon the viscous @xmath0 disk model @xcite , where the underlying assumption is that the disk is turbulent presumably due to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the extremely weak level of ionization introduces strong non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects that suppress or damp the mri in most regions in ppds , while pure hydrodynamic mechanisms appear unable to provide sufficiently level of turbulent viscosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "angular momentum transport in ppds is thus most likely governed by magnetized disk winds , as demonstrated in disk simulations that properly taking into account these non - ideal mhd effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the mean time",
    ", the mri may operate in the surface layer of the outer disk , owing to strong far - uv ( fuv ) ionization at disk surface @xcite , which can lead to vigorous turbulence and mediate a certain level of viscous transport of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we note that in the conventional studies of mhd winds , wind launching generally requires near equipartition field at the disk midplane ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the disk surface density must be very low to be consistent the observed disk accretion rates ( e.g. , @xcite , otherwise , accretion rate would become too high ) , making the disk wind scenario less appealing to account for the mass content of gas and dust in ppds .",
    "on the other hand , in the aforementioned more realistic simulations , winds are launched from several scale heights above midplane , because the midplane region is too weakly ionized for sufficient coupling between the gas and magnetic fields .",
    "with much weaker field ( magnetic pressure much less than midplane gas pressure ) permitted for wind launching , the new scenario simultaneously accounts for the accretion rates and mass budget from observations .",
    "the paradigm shift towards wind - driven ppd evolution calls for a model framework in replacement of @xmath0-disk models .",
    "the aforementioned simulations are all local in vertical extent , and hence are unable to provide reliable estimates of wind kinematics .",
    "an initial study by @xcite took the fitting relations of viscous stress and wind torque from @xcite s outer disk simulations and found slow disk evolution followed by rapid dispersal .",
    "disk mass loss was not included in their study .",
    "a more reliable disk evolution framework would require better determination of the wind torque and wind mass loss rate , and their dependence on physical parameters .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter b16 ) proposed a physically motivated , semi - analytical 1d model of ppd disk winds with global treatment of wind kinematics .",
    "the model further takes into account thermodynamical effects and unifies the classical ( cold ) mhd disk wind with photoevaporation . despite remaining uncertainties explicitly discussed there , it now becomes possible to incorporate the key results into a framework of global wind - driven ppd evolution , and explore in parallel the role played by magnetic fields and thermodynamics",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "we describe our formalism and methodology in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : prof ] , we discuss the general angular momentum transport and mass loss processes without evolving the disk , and study parameter dependence .",
    "disk evolutionary properties are studied in section [ sec : evolve ] .",
    "we extend our model to discuss additional effects including level of disk flaring and x - ray heating in section [ sec : ext ] .",
    "implications and limitations of our study are discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we construct a 1 d disk model on the evolution of the disk surface density @xmath1 as a function of disk cylindrical radius @xmath2 in the presence of turbulence , wind torque and mass loss ( section [ ssec : eqs ] ) . in the mean time",
    ", we adopt a simple treatment of disk vertical structure to estimate the vertical location @xmath3 where external far - uv ( fuv ) radiation can penetrate , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) where the wind is launched ( wind base ) , based on which we calculate the transport properties ( section [ ssec : model ] ) .",
    "hence , our model can be considered as 1 + 1 d. we discuss calculation procedures and model parameters in section [ ssec : proc ] .",
    "we begin by writing down the equations governing the surface density evolution , incorporating the effects of viscosity , wind torque and mass loss .",
    "let @xmath6 be the net accretion rate at cylindrical radius @xmath2 .",
    "we adopt the sign convention such that @xmath7 is positive for net accretion .",
    "let @xmath8 be the cumulative wind mass loss rate enclosed within radius @xmath2 .",
    "we will always use its differential form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the radius of the disk inner edge beyond which the wind is launched .",
    "the bulk of ppds is cold , and unless unrealistically strongly magnetized , rotation is largely keplerian , with specific angular momentum @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the keplerian speed and corresponding angular frequency .",
    "let @xmath14 be the vertically integrated total radial angular momentum flux .",
    "it is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 accounts for angular momentum flux generated from internal stresses , including reynolds stress , maxwell stress , and potentially stress from disk self - gravity ( not included above ) in the case of a massive disk that is gravitationally unstable , with overline representing averaging over the local volume .",
    "here , we follow the @xmath0 convention , with @xmath17 being disk sound speed . note that @xmath0 can be position dependent , and we use @xmath18 to represent an effective , ( density - weighted ) vertically - averaged value .",
    "let @xmath19 be the total vertical angular momentum flux extracted from the disk ( by the mhd wind ) enclosed within radius @xmath2 .",
    "we only use its differential form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is called the wind lever arm ( dimensionless ) . for wind launched from radius @xmath23 ,",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath24 is that it is the ratio of specific angular momenta in the wind flow and in the keplerian disk at @xmath25 , and it is related to wind alfvn radius @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 term represents the _ excess _ angular momentum extracted from the disk , related to the wind torque . in the above",
    ", we have dropped the hydrodynamic term in the definition of @xmath29 , which corresponds to the standard definition of the wind base @xmath4 @xcite : at the wind base , @xmath30 .",

    "this is because we directly parameterize @xmath0 from the @xmath36 component of the stress tensor @xmath37 ( the terms in the parenthesis in equation ( [ eq : w ] ) ) , whereas assuming navier - stokes viscosity @xmath38 , @xmath37 involves @xmath39 which yields an extra factor of @xmath40 . ]",
    "it clearly generalizes the viscous evolution equation to include wind - driven accretion and mass loss terms ( the 2nd and 3rd terms on the right hand side ) . to evaluate these terms , we must determine @xmath41 , @xmath22 and @xmath42 at each radius , as we do in the next subsection .",
    "we follow and extend the work of b16 and construct the vertical dimension of our wind model to calculate wind properties , and the basic picture is illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we assume that the disk follows a two - temperature profile with @xmath43 in the disk interior and @xmath44 at disk surface ( atmosphere ) , and transitions at vertical height @xmath45 .",
    "both layers are treated as vertically isothermal .",
    "disk temperature @xmath46 is largely determined by stellar irradiation .",
    "we use a power - law temperature profile similar to the standard minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) model @xcite with @xmath47 where @xmath48 is radius measured in au , and @xmath49 is the power law index . by default , we take @xmath50 , as in the mmsn model . the corresponding disk isothermal sound speed @xmath51 and disk scale height @xmath52 satisfy @xmath53 . with @xmath54 increasing with @xmath2 ,",
    "the disk is flared , as is well known from sed modeling of t tauri disks @xcite .",
    "disk surface ( atmosphere ) temperature is largely determined strong heating from stellar far - uv ( fuv ) radiation and x - rays . for simplicity , we assume it is a constant factor higher than disk temperature @xmath55 and hence atmosphere sound speed @xmath56 . in practice , we take @xmath57 in our calculations , consistent with typical results from more detailed thermo - chemical calculation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as observational constraints from the hd 163296 disk @xcite .    in the mean time , fuv is capable of fully ionizing carbon and sulfur species , leading to an ionization fraction @xmath58 , and gas and magnetic fields become well coupled in the fuv layer @xcite .",
    "we note that x - rays alone generally produces much lower level of ionization in the surface layer ( e.g. , cf .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite ) . launching of mhd winds",
    "requires sufficient coupling between gas and magnetic fields , and hence it mainly relies upon fuv ionization .",
    "let @xmath59 be the characteristic penetration depth of fuv photons .",
    "its value is uncertain and depends on the fuv luminosity from the protostar , as well as the abundance of very small grains .",
    "here we adopt the calculation results by @xcite , quoting @xmath60 and treat it as a constant at all radii .",
    "the location of the fuv front is determined by tracing radial rays from the central star , until the column density traversed by the rays equals to @xmath59 ( see section [ sssec : base ] for details ) .    by default , we assume that the penetration depth of fuv and x - rays are comparable so that @xmath3 is determined by @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , we assume the rapid increase of temperature at @xmath45 is accompanied by a transition into ideal mhd regime at disk surface . in reality , x - rays may be able to provide heating into deeper layers .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ ssec : xray ] , where we relax this assumption .    , and we use @xmath4 to denote the wind base where the wind is launched . in general , @xmath61 unless net vertical magnetic field is not sufficiently strong . in this case , the warm surface layer can become mri active ( achieved at the outer disk ) , and @xmath62 , sandwiching a warm mri layer . not reflected in this cartoon picture is that the disk is flared , making fuv radiation easier to penetrate into the outer disk.,width=340 ]    another important location is the wind base @xmath4 , from which the wind is launched .",
    "the wind model of b16 assumed @xmath63 motivated by numerical simulations of the inner disk @xcite . towards the outer disk , however , fuv can effectively penetrate deeper into the disk ( in terms of @xmath64 ) as the disk is flared , and this can make the surface layer subject to the mri @xcite .",
    "a disk wind can also be launched from the surface mri turbulent layer in the presence of net vertical field @xcite , and local simulations applicable to the outer ppds found evidence that disk outflow is launched from a higher position than the fuv front @xcite .",
    "we describe a prescription in section [ sssec : base ] to approximately determine the location of @xmath62 in this case , and treat the layer @xmath65 as being mri active .",
    "we apply the b16 model in the wind zone at @xmath66 , from which we estimate the wind mass loss rate and wind torque .",
    "although the b16 model was constructed assuming laminar flows and does not strictly apply to estimate the wind kinematics of outflows launched from a turbulent surface , we assume that it can still provide a reasonable approximation in terms of wind mass loss rate and angular momentum transport .",
    "below , we first construct the wind model assuming the locations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are known , then we iteratively determine their locations .",
    "the b16 wind model is constructed from the wind base @xmath4 .",
    "being a wind model that takes into account both magnetic and thermal effects , the most important parameters are the net vertical magnetic field strength @xmath67 threading the disk and wind / atmosphere temperature @xmath68 ( or the atmosphere sound speed @xmath69 ) . we treat them as our main physical parameters , and they correspond to @xmath70 and @xmath71 defined in the b16 model .",
    "we will discuss our choice of @xmath67 in section [ sssec : bz ] .",
    "concerning wind temperature @xmath68 , characterized by the @xmath72 factor in ( [ eq : f ] ) , we apply an additional constraint such that the ratio of surface sound speed to keplerian velocity @xmath73 .",
    "the b16 model tends to be less reliable at higher temperature because the slow magnetosonic point is generally located below the wind base , violating the assumptions made there .",
    "however , we expect this compromise to have only minor impact in our calculations . as discussed in b16 ( see their figure 12 ) ,",
    "wind kinematics is not very sensitive to wind temperature , which we also confirm in our global disk calculations in section [ sssec : tatm ] .",
    "we fix other parameters considered in b16 at their fiducial values , where it was found that the wind solutions are generally not sensitive to these parameters .",
    "in particular , wind properties are not very sensitive to the field inclination angle @xmath74 because the wind is warm .",
    "we thus choose representative field geometry parameters @xmath75 .",
    "we also choose the field divergence parameter to be @xmath76 .",

    ", pressure balance requires a density jump between the disk side and the atmosphere side @xmath83 and we define @xmath84 .",
    "while this jump should occur more smoothly in reality where temperature transition is more smooth , the resulting uncertainty can be absorbed into @xmath59 . between @xmath85 , another hydrostatic equilibrium",

    "typically , the wind base is located at several disk scale heights above midplane , and regions with @xmath88 encloses most of the disk mass .",
    "thus , midplane density @xmath82 can be determined from surface density @xmath89 once @xmath3 is known .    for the purpose of locating the wind base",
    "( see section [ sssec : base ] ) , we also need the density profile in the vicinity of the wind base so as to calculate the column densities for fuv ray tracing . due to magnetic forces",
    ", it can deviate substantially from hydrostatic equilibrium . from figure 3 of b16",
    ", we see that at fixed wind temperature @xmath90 , the wind density profile is almost independent of wind magnetization up to a substantial distance ( @xmath91 times wind launching radius ) from the wind base .",
    "we have also verified this trend with other choices of wind temperature .",

    "attempts to study magnetic flux transport so far have not considered effects other than viscosity and ohmic resistivity , nor on the effect of wind - driven accretion @xcite . at disk surface .",
    "we expect ppd wind to lie in the opposite limit .",

    "we further consider two scenarios on the evolution of total magnetic flux @xmath105 . in the first scenario , we assume @xmath106 is conserved during disk evolution .",
    "therefore , as accretion proceeds , disk becomes more strongly magnetized . in the second scenario",
    ", we assume that the disk loses magnetic flux in a way such that @xmath106 is proportional to total disk mass @xmath107 .",
    "this treatment avoids significant accumulation of magnetic flux and results in slower evolution .",
    "it is conceivable that magnetic flux evolution can have major impact on global disk structure and evolution , and our phenomenological treatment bares significant uncertainties . for instance , it has been found that the mri can concentrate vertical magnetic flux into ring - like structures @xcite , accompanied by radial pressure variations known as zonal flows @xcite .",
    "hl tau like structures @xcite may simply be a manifestation of such zonal flows . before a more reliable theory of magnetic flux transport is available",
    ", we mainly discuss the general features of wind - driven disk evolution without focusing on the details in the evolution of surface density profiles , and explore the general role played by macroscopic parameters such as total magnetic flux and fuv penetration depth so as to better understand the interplay between magnetic and thermal effects on disk evolution and dispersal .",
    "once the vertical density profile is obtained from our 1 + 1d calculation , we trace radial rays from the origin ( stellar location ) with different inclination angles @xmath74 ( w.r.t .",
    "disk midplane ) to calculate the column density @xmath108 traversed by these rays .",
    "the location of the fuv ionization front @xmath3 is determined by @xmath109 .",
    "while this simple ray - tracing procedure ignores important effects of scattering and self - shielding @xcite , particularly on the lyman-@xmath0 photons , which dominates fuv luminosities @xcite , we again expect the uncertainties can be absorbed into the value of @xmath59 , as a first approximation .    additionally , knowing the net vertical field strength @xmath98",
    ", we can estimate the plasma @xmath102 of the net vertical field at @xmath45 : @xmath110 .",
    "we note that in the ideal mhd regime , the most unstable mri wavelength is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath111 due to the rapid density density drop with height , we expect the mri to be able to effectively operate when @xmath112 . in practice , we assume that the disk surface becomes mri turbulent when @xmath113 . otherwise , we directly set @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath113 , we would expect the wind to be launched from higher location from the mri turbulent layer .",
    "we further follow the density profile using ( [ eq : rhomri ] ) and determine the wind base location @xmath4 by setting @xmath114 .",
    "this treatment is by no means rigorous , yet without better knowledge of the wind launching process from turbulent disk surfaces and its global kinematics , we expect it to be a reasonable first approximation .",
    "local simulations of @xcite lend support to this treatment in that following a generalized ( yet unproved ) procedure to determine @xmath4 , they found that @xmath4 is located above the fuv ionization front , and becomes higher when net vertical field is weaker .",
    "we also note that in their simulations where the disk becomes largely laminar ( ad30au1e3 and ad30au1e4l ) , @xmath115 at the wind base is about @xmath116 and @xmath117 , which are in rough agreement with our choice of threshold @xmath118 .",
    "the procedures above to determine @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be iterated with the vertical density profile calculations described in section [ sssec : den ] .",
    "note that iteration only needs to be done at the beginning to establish the initial condition , where convergence can be achieved to within @xmath119 typically within 3 - 4 iterations .",
    "the subsequent disk evolution is sufficiently slow that no iteration is necessary .",
    "pure hydrodynamic instabilities , such as the vertical shear instability @xcite , convective overstability and baroclinic vortex amplification@xcite , and the zombie vortex instability @xcite , may operate in certain regions of ppds largely depending on disk thermodynamics . in general , these instabilities are found to produce very limited viscous transport with @xmath120 . in this work , we adopt @xmath121 at locations @xmath79 to represent residual  viscosity \" from such hydrodynamic instabilities . as we shall see , because of the dominant role played by disk winds , the exact value of @xmath122 adopted here is unimportant .    if an mri active zone is present , we set @xmath123 in this region ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "the middle left panel shows the location of the fuv ionization front @xmath3 and wind base @xmath4 .",
    "we can see that up to @xmath166 au , the two locations coincide with each other , meaning that the disk is largely laminar up to this radius , with wind being the dominant mechanism for angular momentum transport . the value of @xmath167 increases with increasing @xmath2 , meaning that the fuv ionization front traces a flared geometry . on the other hand , because the disk itself is flared , we see from the inset that when normalized to disk scale height , the value of @xmath64 decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the fuv radiation effectively penetrates deeper ( geometrically ) towards the outer disk .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is @xmath168 at 1 au , and decreases to @xmath169 at @xmath170 au .",
    "these numbers are similar to local disk simulations where the fuv penetration depth is measured in the vertical domain @xcite .    deeper penetration of fuvs towards the outer disk allows the mri to operate at @xmath166 au and beyond in our fiducial model .",
    "correspondingly , the wind base location @xmath4 no longer coincides with @xmath3 , and is located higher in the atmosphere . with @xmath64 decreasing with @xmath2 , the extent of the mri zone increases towards larger @xmath2 , and hence the value of @xmath41 increases towards the outer disk and beyond . nevertheless , because only a very small fraction of mass resides in the mri active zone , the averaged value @xmath41 remains relatively small ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we find that in the inner disk , the wind alfvn radius ( or lever arm ) decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this is a consequence of @xmath172 getting smaller , and hence when assuming constant midplane @xmath115 , the wind base is less strongly magnetized ( larger plasma @xmath102 , or smaller @xmath173 , at the wind base ) . as a result , the wind becomes less efficient in transporting angular momentum towards larger @xmath2 , and the disk has to lose more mass to maintain its accretion rate ( i.e. , higher mass loading ) .",
    "when the mri zone is present , because we have have set fixed @xmath118 at the wind base location , the alfvn radius and mass loading parameter become approximately constants ( as found in b16 ) .",
    "the middle right panel of figure [ fig : fiducial ] shows the radial profiles of wind - driven accretion rate , viscous accretion rate , and wind mass loss rate per logarithmic radii .",
    "we see that clearly , almost the entire disk relies on disk wind to transport angular momentum .",
    "the only exception is near the disk outer edge , where disk surface density exponentially falls off and viscous transport picks up . because of the dominant role played by the wind , viscous disk spread is largely suppressed , except for regions well beyond the characteristic disk size of @xmath146 au .",
    "although we have made an artificial assumption that midplane @xmath115 is constant throughout the disk , the overall wind - driven accretion rate is approximately constant over an extended range of disk radii , indicating that the system shall approximately maintain a steady state .",
    "this is related to the our initial disk surface density that we have chosen , where the midplane pressure @xmath174 .",
    "assuming that the wind - driven accretion rate depends quadratically on the field strength @xcite , a constant accretion rate would require @xmath175 , whose power law index is very close to @xmath176 .",
    "the mass loss profile is best quantified by the mass loss rate per logarithmic radii @xmath177 , which is related to wind - driven accretion rate by ( see b16 ) @xmath178 as the lever arm @xmath179 ^ 2 $ ] decreases towards large @xmath2 , we see that wind mass loss rate rapidly increases with @xmath2 .",
    "the mass loss rate per logarithmic radii is nearly two orders of magnitude below the accretion rate at the innermost radius , while it can become a significant fraction of the accretion rate at tens of au .",
    "thus , we expect that most of the mass loss in ppds occurs through the outer disk via very slow winds , in contrast with observations which typically can only trace winds launched from the inner disk ( see section [ ssec : imp ] for further discussion ) .",
    "we also note that magnetic field geometry from typical disk wind simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) has larger inclination angle with respect to the disk at small disk radius ( @xmath180 ) , while @xmath74 becomes smaller towards the outer disk radii .",
    "if we were to relax our assumption of constant field inclination @xmath75 , this would make @xmath22 larger in the inner disk and smaller in the outer disk ( though not by much in a warm wind , as discussed in b16 ) , and hence strengthen our conclusion that mass loss is most significant in the outer disk .    both wind - driven accretion rate and wind mass loss rate drops when an mri zone is present .",
    "this is can be qualitatively understood from the middle panel of figure 12 in b16 . with the wind launched from higher location hence lower density , both accretion and mass loss rates decreases , and the latter decreases faster .",
    "it is this reduction of wind transport that leaves rooms for viscous effect to take over in the outermost region of the disk .",
    "readers may note a bump at small @xmath2 in wind - driven accretion and mass loss rates in figure [ fig : fiducial ] .",
    "this is due to the inability to properly compute fuv penetration near the inner boundaries , but it is only a minor effect and should not affect the overall calculations .",
    "our calculations have incorporated the fact that a disk wind enhances gas density in the disk atmosphere compared with the hydrostatic case , using the approximate fitting formula ( [ eq : rhowind1 ] ) .",
    "the enhanced density adds to the column density that fuv radiation has to penetrate , thus providing a certain level of shielding .",
    "this shielding effect has been discussed in the context of survival of molecules through various stages of disk evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite further pointed out that strong disk outflow launched from the innermost region of ppds may suppress the wind launching process at larger radii by shielding fuv / x - ray photons .    to assess the significance of this shielding effect",
    ", we also perform a calculation that simply uses the hydrostatic density profile ( [ eq : rhomri ] ) at @xmath181 , and the results are shown in dashed lines in figure [ fig : fiducial ] .",
    "we see that indeed , using hydrostatic density profile makes fuv radiation penetrate deeper , giving smaller @xmath3 at all disk radii .",
    "although the absolute difference in @xmath3 values is small , it can be more clearly seen in the inset of the middle left panel . because density drops very rapidly with height in a gaussian density profile , a small difference in @xmath3 translates to much larger difference in the density @xmath182 there .    without shielding ,",
    "we see that the wind mass loss rate becomes larger by a factor of nearly two .",
    "this is because launching the wind from higher density means that the wind is effectively less magnetized , and hence become more heavily loaded ( see again from the middle panel of figure 12 in b16 ) .",
    "thus , the presence of the wind itself helps prevent more severe wind mass loss from the disk ( at a modest level ) .",
    "we also note that the wind launched from the thermally ionized , fully turbulent innermost disk , can also contribute to this shielding effect , which is not included in our calculations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we also see that without shielding , the mri active zone in the outer disk becomes both radially broader and vertically thicker . at each radius ,",
    "a higher fraction of disk mass is located in the mri active zone , resulting in a larger @xmath41 .",
    "we discuss in this subsection the role played by individual physical parameters , including total magnetic flux ( parameterized by midplane @xmath115 ) , fuv penetration depth ( @xmath59 ) , and atmosphere temperature ( characterized by @xmath183 ) .",
    "we vary one parameter at a time .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : param ] and [ fig : snapshots ] .",
    "note that figure [ fig : snapshots ] is exactly analogous to figure 12 of b16 , but applied to a full disk model . in this figure ,",
    "we quote accretion rate measured at 1 au ( as discussed earlier , accretion rate profile is largely flat given our magnetic flux prescription ) . for mass loss , we quote the enclosed mass loss rate ( [ eq : mloss ] ) within radius of @xmath184 au , @xmath185 au and infinity , respectively , to exemplify the mass loss profile .",
    "the left panels of figure [ fig : param ] show the effect of enhanced net vertical magnetic flux , where we choose @xmath186 at midplane . because density structure in the vicinity of the wind base does not change with magnetization ( see section [ sssec : den ] ) , the location of @xmath3 remain largely unchanged . due to stronger magnetization ,",
    "the outer disk is less prone to the mri and the mri active zone shrinks .",
    "while the @xmath0 value is larger in the disk interior at all radii to reflect potentially enhanced viscous transport ( section [ sssec : vis ] ) , and yields higher viscous - driven accretion rate , wind plays a more dominant role in global transport : even in the disk outer edge , wind - driven accretion rate overwhelms viscous decretion rate , and hence viscous spread is suppressed .",
    "stronger vertical fields leads to much enhanced wind - driven accretion rate , but only a modest increase in wind mass loss rate .",
    "this effect is better reflected in the left panel of figure [ fig : snapshots ] , and has also been extensively discussed in b16 . for our fiducial parameters ( midplane @xmath157 ) ,",
    "the mass loss rate integrated over the entire disk is about the same as the mass accretion rate",
    ". the ratio drops to @xmath187 and @xmath188 for midplane @xmath186 and @xmath189 respectively .",
    "thus , level of disk magnetization largely controls the fractional mass loss rate over accretion rate .",
    "in addition , we see that mass loss from within @xmath184 au represents only a very small fraction of total mass loss rate , about @xmath190 .",
    "this fraction increases to about @xmath191 for mass loss enclosed with @xmath192 au .",
    "thus , we reinforce the conclusion that most of the mass loss is achieved at the outer disk , which is probably not easily observable .      the middle panels of figure [ fig : param ] shows the effect of enhanced fuv penetration depth @xmath193 g @xmath152 .",
    "deeper penetration clearly lowers the location of @xmath3 . in the inner disk ( before the mri active zone appears ) , the wind base density and pressure becomes higher , making the wind less strongly magnetized . as discussed in b16 , this leads to the development of stronger toroidal field , which drives both higher wind - driven accretion rate , and higher wind mass loss rate . with a reduction of the alfvn radius , the mass loss rate increases more rapidly .",
    "this trend is more clearly seen in the middle panel of figure [ fig : snapshots ] , and is analogous to the middle panel of figure 12 in b16 .",
    "this is a manifestation of what we termed  magneto - photoevaporation \" in local wind study of b16 to a global disk model .    in the mean time",
    ", deeper fuv penetration enlarges the mri active zone both radially and vertically , leading to enhanced viscous angular momentum transport . from figure",
    "[ fig : param ] , we see that viscous transport starts to dominate over the wind at a smaller radius than in our fiducial case . nevertheless , this radius is still larger than our model disk size of @xmath146 au , and hence wind transport still dominates the bulk of disk evolution .",
    "we also note that our calculation have ignored external fuv irradiation , which likely dominates over fuv from the star at a few tens to @xmath170 au scale @xcite , depending on the intensity of the external radiation field and stellar fuv luminosity . such external irradiation ,",

    "first , it directly affects wind properties via thermodynamics , as studied in detail in b16 .",
    "second , it modifies the surface density structure . in our two - temperature disk model",

    "these two effects turn out to approximately cancel and only weakly affect the geometric depth of fuv penetration , as seen from the right panel of figure [ fig : param ] .    assuming",
    "the atmosphere temperature does not affect the wind base location , b16 found that the overall wind - driven accretion rate and wind mass loss rate are relatively insensitive to variations in wind temperature . incorporating the changes in surface density structure ,",
    "our global calculations show that the same conclusion holds .",
    "further in figure [ fig : snapshots ] , we see that both mass accretion rate and total mass loss rate are very insensitive to @xmath183 .",
    "in this section , we explore the long - term disk evolution based on prescriptions described in section [ ssec : model ] .",
    "we here mainly focus on the global mass budget , in terms of evolution timescale , fractional mass loss through accretion and wind , etc .",
    ", to minimize uncertainties associated with the magnetic flux distribution and evolution .",
    "in figures [ fig : sigevolve ] and [ fig : rateevolve ] , we show the time evolution of disk surface density , and the associated disk mass ( @xmath194 ) , accretion rate and mass loss rate evolution , where accretion rates are measured at the inner disk boundary .",
    "two scenarios of magnetic flux evolution are considered , namely , either total magnetic flux @xmath159 , or @xmath106 is constant .",
    "we see that at early stages , disk evolution proceeds very similarly in these two scenarios .",
    "after about @xmath184 myrs , the disk has lost about @xmath197 of its mass through accretion and wind , and the subsequent evolutionary paths in the two scenarios diverge .",
    "when assuming @xmath159 , the accretion rate gradually decreases with time as magnetic flux is lost , and the evolution slows down . even after @xmath198 years of evolution , the disk still possesses about @xmath199 of its initial mass .",
    "we also see that midplane @xmath115 slowly increases with time , and towards later evolution , wind mass loss rate exceeds accretion rate .    when assuming @xmath106 is constant , on the other hand , we see that accretion rate and mass loss rate maintain approximately a constant level for @xmath91 myrs .",
    "this is because magnetic field strength roughly stays constant in this scenario , which directly regulates accretion rates .",
    "constant accretion / mass loss rates lead to rapid depletion of disk materials , and we see that total disk mass plunges down in a runaway manner shortly after @xmath200 myrs . as the majority of disk mass is accreted or lost , fuv radiation can penetrate substantially deeper , enhancing the mass loss process relative to accretion . in the mean time , the mri active zone grows and allows viscous spread to dominate in the outermost disk .",
    "the reduction of accretion rate near the end is a result of the redistribution of magnetic flux towards the outer disk ( due to viscous spreading ) .",
    "the two scenarios discussed here can be considered as two extreme limits on magnetic flux evolution .",
    "rapid loss of magnetic flux leads to slow evolution and long disk lifetime , while conservation of magnetic flux leads to a two - timescale behavior : disk depletion occurs on timescales much shorter than disk lifetime .",
    "the latter behavior was also discussed by @xcite when assuming constant total magnetic flux .",
    "the reality may lie in between the two extreme scenarios , which we use in the next subsection as a way to constrain disk lifetime .    for comparison",
    ", we also show in dash - dotted lines of figure [ fig : sigevolve ] results from a pure viscous disk evolution model assuming constant @xmath195 .",
    "besides the sequential drop in surface density , disk evolution is characterized by the expansion of the outer disk ( viscous spreading ) . over the course of a few myrs , the disk size ( defined by the radius above a certain threshold surface density )",
    "have expanded by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this is much more significant than that in our fiducial disk evolution models , even viscous spreading dominates in the outermost region of the disk .",
    "thus , we conclude that wind - dominated ppd evolution likely undergoes very little expansion of the outer disk as compared with viscous evolution models .          to better quantify the timescale of disk evolution and the significance of mass loss from disk winds , we have carried out a series of disk evolution calculations scanning the parameter space . because we have found that the wind transport properties are the least sensitive to wind temperature @xmath68 , we fix @xmath201 in all the calculations .",
    "we consider midplane plasma @xmath202 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and fuv penetration depth @xmath160 and @xmath203 g @xmath152 .",
    "we do not evolve the disk all the way to the end , but terminate the evolution when the disk has lost half of its mass , and call this time half disk lifetime @xmath204 .",
    "we do so mainly because long - term evolution calculations likely bare large uncertainties due to our ignorance on magnetic flux evolution . for each set of parameters",
    ", we perform two runs , evolving the disk either assuming magnetic flux conservation @xmath158 const , or @xmath159 .",
    "as discussed earlier , we may consider these two cases as two extreme scenarios , which set the lower and upper limits of @xmath204 .. based on our results , if magnetic flux is approximately conserved during disk evolution , we approximately have @xmath205 . if the disk loses magnetic flux , then @xmath206 .",

    "it mostly depends on the amount of magnetic flux threading the disks . for our fiducial disk model , midplane plasma @xmath208 yields @xmath209 that is in best agreement with observational constraints of disk lifetime ( e.g. , @xcite ) on a few myr time scale .",
    "it also supports the interpretation of fossil magnetic field measurement of the solar nebular @xcite .",
    "note that increasing or reducing the field strength by a factor of only @xmath210 ( a factor @xmath192 change in @xmath115 ) would yield disk lifetime that is either too short or too long .",
    "all calculations with @xmath157 yield a fractional wind mass loss @xmath207 around one half ( 0.3 - 0.7 ) .",

    "the contrast between mass accretion and outflow is more prominent as the disk becomes more strongly magnetized . on the other hand , because of the relatively gentle dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath212 on @xmath59 ( see figure [ fig : snapshots ] ) , reduction of @xmath204 is only modest .",

    "in this subsection , we consider disks that are less flared , which is expected to affect the penetration of fuv / x - rays in heating / ionizing the disk surface layer . although the temperature structure of ppds is not well constrained observationally , this study is in part motivated by the sed - based classification of herbig ae / be disks that show two distinct groups with either flared or flat geometry @xcite , it has recently been found that flared herbig ae / be disks all have large gaps @xcite , and some flat disks may have small gaps @xcite , suggesting a evolutionary path starting from flat full disks towards flared transition disks .",

    "this is also natural consequence of larger @xmath64 . with @xmath217 ,",
    "the inner edge of the mri active zone is already at @xmath220 in our disk model , while for a nearly flat disk with @xmath218 , the mri active zone diminishes : the entire disk becomes largely laminar .    with larger @xmath64 in less flared disks , the wind base density and pressure is smaller , making the wind base region effectively more strongly magnetized .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : flare ] , the alfvn radius becomes larger in less flared disks .",

    "overall , the situation for less flared disk is similar to the case with smaller @xmath59 : less flared disks lead to a reduction of both wind - driven accretion rate and mass loss rate ( and hence longer @xmath204 ) , but the reduction of mass loss rate is more significant .",
    "the studies in the preceding sections have implicitly assumed that x - rays and fuv have similar penetration depth , as described in section [ ssec : model ] . in reality ,",

    "we see that despite that x - rays can heat into deeper regions in the disk , leading to substantial differences in disk vertical density and temperature structures , the wind properties resulting from the two cases are remarkably similar .",
    "this is most easily understood from the example in the right panel , where we show the vertical pressure profiles at 1 au in the two cases .",
    "with @xmath44 at disk surface layer , the density profile , as well as pressure profile , are in the form of @xmath228 .",
    "if we assume the column densities ( from a position at disk surface ) radially towards the star and vertically towards large @xmath196 are proportional to each other ( which approximately holds for flared disks where column density is dominated by local contributions ) , then for a given @xmath59 , the density and pressure at the fuv ionization front @xmath223 ( @xmath229 in this case ) are largely unchanged regardless of whether x - rays penetrate deeper or not . in this example , we find the pressure ( and density ) difference between the two cases at @xmath230 is only @xmath231 , which explains the very small difference in @xmath26 .",

    "photoevaporation has long been considered as the primary mechanism for the dispersal of ppds . as a pure thermal wind",

    "wind mass loss in our calculations is directly coupled to angular momentum transport , instead of being treated separately .",
    "this leads to the correlation between disk lifetime and fractional wind mass loss , as a natural consequence of mhd disk wind .",

    "while our calculations have treated thermodynamics in a highly simplified manner , our main results suggest that wind mass loss is only modestly sensitive to thermodynamic effects , whereas the dominant role is played by amount of magnetic flux .",
    "as suggested in b16 , a unified description of disk wind mass loss would be better termed  magneto - photoevaporation \" .",
    "photoevaporation has been commonly invoked as an explanation of ( a fraction of ) transition disks , a small fraction of ppds characterized by the presence of large inner gaps / holes , by inside - out clearing ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the mhd framework , whether the disk can be cleared inside - out depends on the details of magnetic flux evolution , which remains poorly understood .",
    "for instance , if the inner disk is capable of maintaining its total magnetic flux ( e.g. , possibly due to the hall effect ) , while the outer disk loses flux ( i.e. , as a result of ambipolar diffusion ) , then inside - out clearing would be a natural consequence .",
    "one important implication of wind mass loss is that mass is primarily removed from disk surface , while in low turbulent environment , most dust / solids settle and reside around disk midplane .",
    "the removal of largely dust - free gas , and in combination with radial drift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can directly enhance the dust - to - gas mass ratio , creating favorable conditions for planetesimal formation @xcite , and particularly allowing for smaller , more strongly coupled dust to participate in planetesimal formation @xcite .",
    "dust evolution has been incorporated in the recent study by @xcite in the context of photoevaporation on top of viscous disk evolution , and they found significant enhancement of dust - to - gas ratio as a robust outcome of surface mass loss .",
    "we thus expect the same conclusion to hold in the mhd wind , or magneto - photoevaporation framework . the fact that wind mass loss is most significant towards the outer disk implies that the enhancement of dust - to - gas ratio may proceed from the outer disk inward .",
    "signatures of wind from ppds have been routinely observed in the form of blue - shifted emission lines such as from co , oi and neii lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but constraining the wind mass loss rate from line data is extremely difficult .",

    "@xcite recently reported @xmath235 in the range of @xmath236 with large uncertainties . with typical blueshift of the order a few km s@xmath237 and given the excitation conditions , the wind most likely originates from the inner few au .",
    "our results suggest that the inferred mass loss rate only represents a small fraction ( @xmath238 ) of total disk wind mass loss . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the measurements are consistent with our expectations of @xmath239 .",
    "we have discussed in section [ sssec : shield ] that the column density in the wind flow can provide shielding for the uv radiation from the protostar .",
    "wind shielding has also been discussed in the context of survival of molecules @xcite . in reality ,",
    "fuv penetration is largely determined by the abundance of very small grains in the disk surface and wind column , which is very poorly known .",
    "we speculate that if very small grains are sufficiently abundant at disk surface , they can be efficiently lifted by the wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can substantially enhance the fuv opacity .",
    "the non - detection of turbulent motion towards the outer region of herbig ae disk hd 163296 @xcite also indirectly suggests that shielding of fuv radiation may reduce or even quench the mri zone in the outer disk .",
    "our fiducial choice of a relatively small @xmath59 reflects such considerations , but the potentially important effect of wind shielding calls for further study .",
    "our global model inherits from the wind model of b16 , thus share the same uncertainties , especially from the fact that we prescribe the wind geometry instead of solving cross - field force balance .",
    "however , as discussed there , more uncertainties arise from our ignorance about magnetic flux distribution , which eventually determines the wind geometry .",
    "thus , b16 chose to parameterize the disk geometry and focus on wind physics along prescribed field lines .",
    "our global wind model follows the same logic , and mainly explores the consequence of the b16 model at a global scale .",
    "our wind model may suffer from two systematic uncertainties .",
    "the first arises from a potentially systematic variation of wind geometry with radius .",
    "for instance , global wind simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) typically find that towards larger radii , the wind inclination angle @xmath74 increases , and wind field lines get more divergent .",
    "we have adopted fixed wind geometry parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 in this work . based on results from the b16 model , with field lines getting",
    "more inclined and more divergent , the alfven radius ( lever arm ) would decrease , leading to more pronounced fractional mass loss towards the outer disk .",
    "the second uncertainty arises from the extension of the b16 wind model to wind launched from the mri active region , whereas the model is intended for a laminar wind .",
    "wind launching in the mri case is a robust phenomenon as observed in local simulations @xcite , and the field configuration is fully dominated by the toroidal component indicating wind launching by magnetic pressure gradient , similar to the laminar wind in ppds discussed in b16 .",
    "we thus expect our treatment at least qualitatively reflects the relation between mass loss and angular momentum transport in this regime , while global simulations are certainly needed to better calibrate wind kinematics .",
    "our calculations parameterize the role of thermodynamics simply in terms of fuv ( and x - ray ) penetration , constant wind temperature and level of disk flaring . in reality , radiative transfer and photo - chemistry are essential to better quantify thermodynamical effects . due to the important role played by grain opacity ,",
    "these are coupled with the size distribution and spatial distribution of dust grains , which in turn are coupled to disk dynamics .",
    "the interplay among dynamics , dust evolution , chemistry , and radiation in the system may result in much richer phenomenology than considered here , and are worth more in - depth investigations .",
    "the sensitive dependence of wind and transport properties on magnetic field strength calls for better understandings of magnetic flux transport , as already discussed in section [ sssec : bz ] .",
    "moreover , the starting point of our evolution calculations is motivated from a typical disk at class ii phase .",
    "disk evolution starts from much earlier phases , and magnetic flux is well known to control disk dynamics from the disk formation stage ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular , the hall effect could induce a bimodality on initial disk size depending on the polarity of the background magnetic field with respect to disk rotation axis @xcite , and such bimodality is likely to be carried into all later phases of disk evolution @xcite .",
    "how the hall effect affect magnetic flux evolution is unknown , but hints for strong polarity dependence exist from local studies @xcite .",
    "our figure [ fig : lifetime ] shows that to reproduce observed ppd lifetime , the amount of magnetic flux is constrained to a relatively narrow range .",
    "some feedback and self - regulation mechanism might be involved in magnetic flux evolution .",
    "future global simulations of wind - driven disk evolution with resolved disk microphysics are essential to address these problems .",
    "in this work , we have constructed a framework to study global evolution of ppds that incorporates wind - driven accretion , wind mass loss , and viscous transport . the magneto - thermal wind model the b16",
    "is adopted as the primary ingredient of the framework .",
    "the model is motivated by recent local simulations of ppd gas dynamics that have properly incorporated disk microphysics , which suggest that the mri is largely suppressed in the disk interior and magnetized wind is launched in the externally heated and ionized surface layer from the fuv ionization front @xcite .",
    "we further consider the fact that the well ionized surface layer can be subject to the mri in the outer region of ppds @xcite , depending on the strength of vertical magnetic field fields and fuv penetration depth , which contributes to viscous angular momentum transport .",
    "ideally , disk evolution should be coupled with a procedure for magnetic flux evolution .",
    "the latter is treated phenomenologically in this work by assuming constant midplane plasma @xmath115 , but can be improved upon better understanding of magnetic flux transport in ppds .",
    "* disk evolution is largely dominated by mhd wind - driven accretion and mass loss . contribution from the mri",
    "can be important in the outermost disk but viscous spread is suppressed . *",
    "the disk evolution timescale sensitively depends on the amount of magnetic flux threading ppds .",
    "disk dispersal is rapid if the disk is able to retain most of its magnetic flux during evolution , otherwise , disk dispersal is gradual .",
    "* given typical disk lifetime of a few myrs , the disk loses comparable amount of mass via disk wind and accretion .",
    "most of the wind mass loss proceeds through the outer disk ( @xmath240 au ) .",
    "fractional mass loss via disk wind increases with decreasing disk magnetization ( increasing disk lifetime ) . *",
    "the depth of fuv penetration and level of disk flaring are the main thermodynamic factors affecting disk evolution .",
    "smaller fuv penetration depth and less flared geometry slightly reduce wind - driven accretion rate , and more strongly reduces fractional wind mass loss .",
    "this work represents an initial effort towards modeling global evolution of ppds that incorporates realistic disk physics . at the moment",
    ", we have mainly focused on the evolution of the overall mass budget , and significant wind mass loss likely substantial enhances the disk dust - to - gas mass ratio and directly promotes planetesimal formation .",
    "better knowledge on magnetic flux evolution is needed to make reliable predictions on the details of disk surface density evolution , allowing for more realistic studies of planet formation .",
