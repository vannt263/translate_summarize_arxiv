    "so called , crossing - point phenomenon is one of the interesting and still puzzling effects in strongly correlated electron systems ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "this type of effect was found also not only for thermodynamic but for dynamic quantities as well ( for example , for frequency dependent optical conductivity ) .",

    "available relevant experimental data can be considered as meagre , therefore further experimental findings of this phenomenon in different systems should be helpful for understanding of its nature .    in this study",
    ", the crossing - point effect is revealed in @xmath19 curves of polycrystalline perovskite - like rusr@xmath0(gd@xmath1ce@xmath2)cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ru1222-gd ) .",

    "this family within range @xmath26 shows superconductivity with @xmath27 up to @xmath28  k for @xmath29 . below @xmath30  80100  k ,",
    "indications of weak - ferromagnetic order are found .",
    "it is believed on these grounds that these compounds are magnetic superconductors .",
    "superconductivity is associated with cuo@xmath0 planes , while magnetic order is thought to be connected with the ruo@xmath0 planes ( see more in reviews @xcite ) .    in the following",
    "we shall present and discuss the crossing - point phenomenon in ru1222-gd found in this study together with indispensable consideration of some specific features of magnetic state of this compound . to reveal and compare paramagnetic effects of different rare - earth components ,",
    "the properties of the samples rusr@xmath0(eu@xmath1ce@xmath2)cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ru1222-eu ) are considered briefly as well .",
    "the samples of ru1222-gd and ru1222-eu were prepared by a solid - state reaction method @xcite .",
    "some of them were set aside ( as - prepared samples ) , while others were annealed in pure oxygen at different pressures .",
    "the samples of ru1222-gd were annealed for 12 hours in 30 , 62 , 78 atm of pure oxygen at 845@xmath5c ; whereas , those of ru1222-eu were annealed for 24 hours at 800@xmath5c in pure oxygen at pressure of 50 and 100 atm .",
    "the samples have been polycrystalline with a grain size of a few @xmath31 m .",
    "they were characterized by resistivity , thermoelectric power , magnetization and specific - heat measurements , which were in part reported in refs .",
    "it was found there that superconductivity is affected by granularity and intergrain josephson coupling .    in this subsection",
    "we present some general magnetic properties of the samples studied with an emphasis on paramagnetic effects of rare - earth ions .",
    "the measurements were made with quantum design devices ( ppms and squid magnetometer ) .",
    "temperature behavior of magnetization , @xmath32 , for the cases of essentially low and appreciably high magnetic field ( figs .",
    "1 and 2 ) reveals important features of complicated magnetic state of these compounds .",
    "it is clearly seen that for both , ru1222-gd and ru1222-eu , a magnetic transition takes place when temperature is lowered below @xmath33 k ( fig .",
    "this is believed to be the transition to a weak - ferromagnetic state determined by ru ions @xcite .",
    "large difference between the fc and zfc curves is likely determined either by high magnetic anisotropy or spin - glass effects .",
    "magnetic order induced in ruthenocuprates by ruo@xmath0 planes is , however , still unclear @xcite and will not be discussed in detail here .",
    "we shall dwell briefly only on a contribution of paramagnetic magnetic moments of rare - earth components to magnetization of ruthenocuprates .",
    "it is known long ago @xcite that paramagnetic properties of trivalent rare - earth ions in chemical compounds are almost identical to those of quasi - free non - interacting ions . in both cases paramagnetism is determined by low - lying states of 4@xmath34 electrons .",
    "effective moment of a rare - earth ion is determined by quantum numbers @xmath35 and according to hund s rule is @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath37 is land factor . for gd@xmath9 ion ( ground state @xmath8 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) @xmath40",
    "is therefore expected to be 7.94 @xmath41 , in agreement with experiment @xcite . for eu@xmath9 ion ( ground state @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) a significant deviation from hund s rule ( which predicts the effective moment to be zero )",
    "is found in experiment @xcite . in particular at room temperature @xmath46 @xmath41",
    "is observed .",
    "the reason is that for eu@xmath9 ions at high enough temperature the separation of their ground 4@xmath34 state ( with @xmath45 ) from higher level is comparable with @xmath47 , so that an additional contribution to susceptibility appears @xcite .",
    "for fairly low temperature , however , the effective paramagnetic moment for eu@xmath9 ions is expected to be zero @xcite .",
    "it can be expected from the aforesaid that gd@xmath9 ions should give a considerable contribution to the total magnetization of ruthenocuprates , especially at low temperature ; whereas , a significant contribution of paramagnetic moments of eu@xmath9 is unlikely .",
    "temperature dependences of magnetization ( figs . 1 and 2 )",
    "correspond to the expected behavior . on the whole",
    ", specific magnetization is much higher in the gd sample as compared with that of the eu sample . in particular , @xmath48 @xmath49/f.u . at @xmath50  k and @xmath51  t for ru1222-gd ( fig .",
    "2 ) . at the same time",
    ", the magnetization of the ru1222-eu sample is about 0.9 @xmath49/f.u . at the same conditions ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    for both , low and high magnetic fields , @xmath32 increases as @xmath52 for the ru1222-gd sample , displaying paramagnetic behavior of gd ions .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath32 saturates at low temperature for the ru1222-eu sample .",
    "it is evident for the latter case that the contribution of eu ions to the total magnetization is negligible in the low temperature range where the magnitute of @xmath53 is determined solely by the magnetic contribution of the ru subsystem .",
    "superconductivity also shows itself to be somewhat different in the @xmath32 curves for the gd and eu samples . in both samples the diamagnetic response below the superconducting transition",
    "can be seen in the zfc curves ( fig .",
    "1 ) , but an appropriate feature in the fc curve is evident only for ru1222-gd sample . with decreasing temperature when",
    "@xmath54 approaching zero , the diamagnetic response of the ru1222-eu saturates ; whereas , that of ru1222-gd decreases ( fig .",
    "specific - heat measurements have been performed for all of the ru1222-gd samples ( as prepared and annealed at different oxygen pressure ) .",
    "all of these samples have two pronounced features ( fig .",
    "3 ) in the low - temperature part of @xmath6 curves : ( 1 ) the jump at the superconducting transition , and ( 2 ) the upturn below 20 k ( schottky - type anomaly ) .",
    "it was found @xcite that , although resistive superconducting transition depends strongly on intergrain connection determined by oxygen annealing , the position of the jump in @xmath6 at the superconducting transition is the same for all samples studied and reflects in this way the bulk properties of the compound .",
    "the eu samples displayed smooth @xmath6 dependences , which were identical for all eu samples studied .",
    "the curves were of the debye type without any low temperature magnetic anomaly or jump at the superconducting transition .",
    "the former is ascribed to the non - magnetic nature of eu ions at low temperature ; whereas , the latter is evidently determined by stronger intergrain disorder in the eu samples as compared with the gd samples @xcite .",
    "the resistive superconducting transitions in the eu samples are much broader and normal - state resistivity is approximately ten times higher than those in the gd samples @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that a sufficiently strong decoupling between grains causes smearing and disappearance of the superconducting feature ( jump ) in @xmath6 curves .",
    "it should be noted that no feature in the temperature dependence of the heat capacity , @xmath6 , associated with magnetic transition at @xmath55  k in the ru magnetic subsystem is found in this study .",
    "this can be attributed to the absence of long - range magnetic order in this subsystem at the transition point due to magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "it is possible as well that this feature is just too weak to be seen on the background lattice contribution to specific heat at this rather high temperature .",
    "the absence of magnetic and superconducting anomalies in @xmath6 curves for ru1222-eu makes it possible to obtain a part of @xmath6 without lattice contribution @xcite by subtraction of the @xmath6 curves for eu from that of the gd samples , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 . this shows more clearly the @xmath56-like feature at the superconducting transition and the schottky - type anomaly below 20 k in gd sample .",
    "the low - temperature schottky - type anomaly can be attributed to splitting of the ground term @xmath57 of paramagnetic gd@xmath9 ions by internal and external magnetic fields , as discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is found in this study that curves @xmath6 for ru1222-gd samples taken at different values of applied magnetic field cross at the same temperature ( the crossing temperature ) @xmath58  k and specific heat value @xmath59  mj / gk ( fig .",
    "4 ) . this takes place for each of the ru1222-gd samples ( as prepared and annealed at different oxygen pressure ) .",
    "contrastingly , the @xmath6 curves of ru1222-eu with nonmagnetic eu ions were found to not depend on the magnetic field ( up to 8 t ) , as can be expected from discussion above .    above the crossing point",
    "some clear kink in the @xmath6 curves occurs in the temperature range of the schottky - type anomaly ( fig .",
    "this kink is positioned at @xmath60  k for @xmath61 , but with increasing field it shifts to lower temperature and seems to be smeared for a sufficiently large field ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in the low - field @xmath32 curves ( upper panel of fig .",
    "1 ) , nothing uncommon can be seen in this temperature range , but in the derivative @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "5 ) , in addition to the very strong features at the superconducting and magnetic transitions at @xmath27 and @xmath63 , a weak but quite clear peculiarity is seen at @xmath64  k , that perhaps pertains to @xmath65 .",
    "the appearance and behavior of @xmath66 with increasing field is suggestive of a transition to an antiferromagnetic state for the gd@xmath9 ion subsystem at low temperature .",
    "this type of transition is ubiquitous in high-@xmath27 cuprates with rare - earth components @xcite .",
    "for example , it is found in gd cuprates that antiferromagnetic ordering of gd@xmath9 ions takes place at @xmath67 of 2.32.4 k for double cuo@xmath0 layer compounds ; whereas , for single - layer ones a higher @xmath67 ( up to 6.6 k ) is revealed @xcite . in the related ruthenocuprate rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath23 ( the ru1212-type phase )",
    "@xmath68  k is found @xcite .",
    "perhaps the decrease in the superconducting diamagnetic response with decreasing temperature in ru1222-gd ( fig .",
    "1 ) might be connected with some kind of magnetic ordering in the gd@xmath9 magnetic subsystem .",
    "unfortunately , the nature of magnetic order induced in the ru1222 ruthenocuprates by ruo@xmath0 planes is still not clear @xcite .",
    "this also hampers the determination of the exact nature of the low - temperature magnetic ordering in the gd ion subsystem .",
    "another difficulty is that , up to date only samples of ru1222 prepared by solid - state reaction method , have been studied .",
    "these samples usually contain different impurity phases @xcite ; thus it can not be ruled out that the distinct but rather weak feature in @xmath6 at @xmath69 may actually be associated with some magnetic impurity phase .",
    "for example , in the ruthenocuprate rusr@xmath0(gd@xmath70ce@xmath71)cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( which is close in composition to that studied in this work ) an impurity phase ( 5% ) of sr@xmath0gdruo@xmath72 was found @xcite which showed antiferromagnetic ordering of gd@xmath9 ions near 3 k.    now let us return again to the crossing point subject .",
    "we have found that in addition to the crossing point at @xmath58  k in @xmath6 curves ( taken at different @xmath15 ) crossing takes place also in @xmath11 curves taken at different temperatures . in this case",
    "the curves cross at @xmath12  t ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in both cases crossing takes place at the same value @xmath59  mj / gk .",
    "figure 6(b ) clearly suggests that @xmath73 does not depend on @xmath15 at @xmath74  k ( dashed line ) . on the other hand",
    "it is temperature independent at @xmath75  t ( dashed line in fig .",
    "6(a ) ) . in either case",
    "a constant value of @xmath73 is @xmath59  mj / gk is observed .",
    "the crossing point effect is considered @xcite as some type of universality for strongly correlated electron systems , but no unified mechanism for this phenomenon is proposed . only some general reasons and prerequisites for its occurrence",
    "have been formulated .",
    "it is believed , for example @xcite , that the crossing ( _ isosbestic _ ) point occurs in systems which are close to some quantum or second - order phase transition , or in systems with some magnetic instability , so that properties of such a system are rather sensitive to thermodynamic variables ( like temperature , pressure , magnetic field ) .",
    "it is asserted @xcite , among other suggestions , that the crossing point should become apparent in a system which is a superposition of two ( or more ) components , like that in the known gorter - casimir two - fluid model of superconductivity .",
    "the total density of these components , depending , for example , on @xmath54 and @xmath15 , is constant , @xmath76 following the general concept of such a `` two - fluid '' model @xcite , some function @xmath77 , describing the properties of this system , can be written as @xmath78 in this case the crossing point of curves for different temperatures @xmath54 should occur at a single point @xmath79 if @xmath80 .",
    "this `` two - fluid '' approach is perhaps relevant for the crossing point in @xmath19 curves below the superconducting transition temperature found in the cuprate tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath81@xcite , where the crossing takes place at @xmath82  @xmath27 .    in considering of a crossing effect in @xmath19 curves",
    "what the motive force for strong magnetic field dependence of specific heat is should be first of all taken into account . in the case of gd",
    "ruthenocuprates considered in this study , the motive force is connected not with superconductivity , but with splitting of the ground term @xmath57 of paramagnetic gd@xmath9 ions by internal and external magnetic fields @xcite . according to kramers theorem @xcite ,",
    "the degenerate ground term can be split into four doublets in tetragonal symmetry . in particular",
    ", internal molecular fields can arise in the ruthenocuprate from both the gd and ru sublattices and can coexist with superconductivity .",
    "even though a direct gd - gd exchange interaction is unlikely , these ions can be magnetically polarized by the 4@xmath83 - 4@xmath34 interaction . generally , the schottky term in the specific heat for compounds with gd@xmath9 ions should be attributed to splitting of all four doublets , although actually only some of them make the dominant contribution to the effect .    in the simplest case a schottky term in the specific heat is determined by properties of a two - level system @xcite .",
    "paramagnetic ions in a solid have magnetic dipole moments ( @xmath31 ) . to a first approximation , these do not interact with each other but can respond to an applied external magnetic field . in a magnetic field each dipole can exist in one of two states aligned with the field ( spin up ) or antialigned ( spin down ) .",
    "spin up ( @xmath84 ) and spin down ( @xmath85 ) dipoles have an energy @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the population of these discrete energy levels depends on temperature and applied field .",
    "this gives a contribution to the specific heat in a solid known as schottky anomaly @xcite , which is usually seen only at low temperature , where other contributions are sufficiently small .",
    "it should be mentioned that the total number , @xmath88 , of magnetic dipoles in the two - level system can be presented as a sum of two temperature and magnetic - field dependent components @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are numbers of the spin - up and spin - down dipoles .",
    "this relation is similar to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , so that the `` two - fluid '' approach @xcite is apparently applicable to a degree to the two - level system as well .",
    "the schottky - type anomaly in the @xmath19 curves is by itself only a background for the crossing effect found in this study , like that previously seen in ndmno@xmath21 @xcite . for a deeper insight into this phenomenon the thermodynamic approach @xcite can be helpful .",
    "it can be suggested rather safely that within the low temperature range , where the crossing phenomenon takes place , the magnetic contribution to specific heat is dominant .",
    "the expression for the specific heat at constant @xmath15 is @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "any crossing of specific heat curves @xmath93 means that @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\frac{\\partial c_{h}(t , h)}{\\partial h}\\bigg |_{t_{\\ast}(h ) } = t_{\\ast}(h)\\frac{\\partial^{2}m(t , h)}{\\partial t^2}\\bigg    conjugate thermodynamic variable for the field @xmath15 .",
    "only if @xmath17 is independent of @xmath15 , will all @xmath95 curves intersect in one point demonstrating a true crossing effect like that shown in fig .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 3 ) that the crossing occurs at the temperature @xmath17 where @xmath96 , that is @xmath97 must have some type of turning point .",
    "figure  7 shows that @xmath62 at @xmath51  t tends to some constant value with decreasing temperature , while @xmath98 tends to zero in this temperature range .",
    "we have found that @xmath98 becomes approximately zero for @xmath54 below 3  k. more precise determination of the point where @xmath99 is difficult due to the statistical uncertainty of the second derivative . in any case , however , results of this study support substantially the theoretical prediction of ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is seen in fig . 6",
    "that at @xmath100 specific heat is temperature independent , that is equal to the constant value @xmath59  mj / gk , @xmath101 from this it follows that @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a constant .",
    "it is also evident that at @xmath104 except for the logarithmic term , some polynomial function of @xmath54 should be added for the approximation of @xmath105 .    in summary ,",
    "rather thorough models of _ isosbestic points _ have been developed for conjugate variables @xmath16 and @xmath106 .",
    "some models were developed for strongly correlated electrons in the frame of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "we hope that results of this study will promote development of an adequate model for crossing point in @xmath19 curves for magnetic systems undergoing a transition from classical to quantum behavior in @xmath19 with decreasing temperature .",
