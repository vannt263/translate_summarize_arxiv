    "@xmath26 is the detuning from the cavity resonance frequency .",
    "note that we have dropped purely classical and small terms .",
    "note also that @xmath27 is slowly varying as we are in the rotating frame .",
    "in the following , we work in the resolved sideband regime @xmath28 and assume similiar mechanical resonators with @xmath29 . for cooperative effects to occur , the coupling needs to become resonant .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the pump frequency @xmath3 such that @xmath30 . with this choice , the slowly varying intracavity field oscillates at the mean frequency of the mechanical oscillators .",
    "let us first consider driving on the anti - stokes sideband , i.e.  @xmath31 .",
    "the physical process that we consider in this section corresponds to the generation of a phonon @xmath32 which then can combine with a pump photon @xmath3 to produce an anti - stokes photon @xmath33 . here ,",
    "the interaction terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 become off - resonant and can be neglected in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "we introduce dissipative dynamics , accounting for leakage of photons and phonons , in form of the quantum langevin equations for the heisenberg operators @xmath27 and @xmath11    [ eq : quantumlangevinequations ] @xmath36    where @xmath37 are the quantum langevin forces , which account for vacuum noise and any thermal noise entering the system .",

    "let us briefly discuss the results for driving on the anti - stokes sideband , while limiting our discussion to @xmath1 mechanical modes .",
    "without loss of generality we assume that @xmath51 are real - valued .",
    "we furthermore require that @xmath52 , which is usually the case for typical realizations of the proposed system @xcite .",
    "also , let us denote the frequency difference of the mechanical oscillators by @xmath53 .",
    "[ fig : reddetuned ] shows the real part of the response function in the vicinity of the resonant anti - stokes sideband . for the degenerate case of identical mechanical elements @xcite",
    ", the system divides into a bright superradiant mode ( solid curve ) with linewidth @xmath54 and a dark mode @xmath55 , which is effectively decoupled from the cavity .",
    "the broadening is proportional to the optomechanical damping rate @xmath56 .",
    "an analysis of the roots of the denominator of @xmath57 shows that the formation of a bright and a dark mode occur only for @xmath58 and the dark mode asymptotically decouples from the cavity for @xmath59 .",
    "we provide a detailed derivation of this result for the similar case of driving on the stokes sideband .",
    "we finally note the connection between the superradiance of the mechanical oscillators and the superradiance of the atomic system in a cavity @xcite . in both cases",
    "the system interacts with the cavity photons of a single common cavity mode which in turn interacts with the vacuum modes of the outside world  the bath is made up of all the outside vacuum modes .",
    "it is well known that the single atom decay rate in the cavity is given by the purcell formula @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the coupling of the atom to the cavity . for the mechanical elements ,",
    "the couling with the cavity gives an additional decay rate @xmath62 . in the atomic case ,",
    "the decay rate of a single atom in the presence of the other atoms is given by @xmath63 , whereas in our optomechanical system the decay rate of a single mechanical oscillator is @xmath64 .",
    "thus the similarity between the atomic and the mechanical case is striking .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the whole process can be thought of as a scattering of phonons of different mechanical oscillators into a common cavity mode of indistinguishable photons . in this case , we observe superradiance and each mechanical oscillator is more rapidly damped , i.e.  emits phonons more rapidly which are converted into anti - stokes cavity photons .",
    "we will now study the system under resonant driving in the stokes sideband with @xmath65 .",
    "the physical process here is different  it leads to the spontaneous generation of a phonon and a stokes photon .",
    "thus the phonon field can grow and one can have phonon laser action .    in what follows",
    ", we describe the characteristics and the origin of the collective behavior resulting in this regime . using the same approach as before , we start by dropping non - resonant terms ( rwa ) in the linearized optomechanical hamiltonian .",
    "this yields the quantum langevin equations    [ eq : qula_blue ] @xmath66    with quantum langevin forces defined by eqs .  .",
    "a short calculation yields the system s response function @xmath67 with @xmath48 as above and @xmath68 $ ] .    for a critical driving power in the stokes sideband ,",
    "the system exhibits self - sustained oscillations @xcite and becomes unstable .",
    "we thus limit our investigation to the stable driving regime , which can be found by evaluating the routh - hurwitz stability criterion ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) for the quantum langevin equations . for similar mechanical oscillators with @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 the stability condition evaluates to @xmath71 under this condition , the system will also remain stable with finite frequency detuning @xmath72 . for typical structures",
    "@xcite we have @xmath73 and are thus limited to the weak coupling regime , i.e.  @xmath74 , for stable operation .",
    "when the condition does not hold , phonon lasing occurs and eqs .",
    "have to be generalized to include nonlinearities to reach stable operation @xcite . with that , the cavity response @xmath48 is approximately independent of frequency near the mechanical resonance frequencies @xmath13 : @xmath75 the second approximation in eq .",
    "holds for near - degenerate mechanical frequencies , i.e.  @xmath76 .    in the following",
    ", we put special emphasis on the case of @xmath1 mechanical oscillators and generalize our discussion to more than two modes afterwards .",
    "[ fig : bluedetuned ] shows the numerical evaluation of @xmath57 for this case in the vicinity of the resonance . for the multimode system ,",
    "the linewidth of the resonant feature is decreased in comparison to the system of a single mechanical oscillator , whereas the amplitude is strongly increased ( collective gain ) .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the collective gain , that we discuss , is in terms of the phonon variables , as we are investigating phonon laser action .",
    "this should be differentiated from the narrowing of the cavity linewidth which was found in @xcite .    to get an understanding of the cooperative effects leading to this signature",
    ", we analyze the roots of the denominator of @xmath57 . in the approximation of eq .",
    "the roots are given by : @xmath77 , \\ ] ] with the effective complex frequencies of the mechanical oscillators @xmath78 and the optomechanical damping rate @xmath56 .",
    "we can identify @xmath79 as the effective coupling between the mechanical modes , mediated by the photonic field .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of eq . are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurcation ] .",
    "the square root term gives rise to two regimes separated by a bifurcation point at @xmath80 . for a frequency detuning @xmath81 smaller than the effective coupling ,",
    "the effective frequencies of the mechanical modes become degenerate and form two collective normal modes .",
    "this applies to resonant driving both on the stokes and on the anti - stokes sideband . for off - resonant driving the bifurcation point",
    "vanishes ; the formation of collective modes , however , persists .",
    "a similar case of normal mode splitting is known in the context of strong coupling between a single mechanical oscillator and the cavity mode @xcite . in our case , however , we are required to work in the weak coupling regime , where the cavity response function is approximately independent of frequency in the vicinity of the mechanical resonances . in this system ,",
    "the collective modes form due to the effective coupling between the mechanical oscillators , mediated by the photonic field .",
    "the mode showing collective gain with @xmath82 ( lower curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurcation ] ) defines the response of the optomechanical system , as other mode ( upper curve ) asymptotically decouples from the cavity for @xmath59 . here",
    ", the underlying physical process can be seen as a scattering from indistinguishable photons in the cavity field into a single _ collective _ phonon mode , whereas ( in the case of @xmath2 mechanical oscillators ) the other @xmath83 phononic modes do not couple to the light field at all .",
    "this can also be understood by analyzing response function @xmath57 in terms of partial fractions @xmath84 -1 .\\ ] ] this analysis shows that @xmath85 for @xmath59 .",
    "this also applies to the anti - stokes sideband , where only the superradiant mode with @xmath86 contributes to the response function .    in a somewhat different picture",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the structure of the response function .",
    "@xmath57 of the fully degenerate system with identical mechanical oscillators is equal to the response function of a system with a _",
    "single _ oscillator in a cavity with an effective coupling rate of @xmath87 .",
    "this applies both to the stokes and the anti - stokes sideband and can readily be generalized for a system of @xmath2 oscillators . here , the effective coupling rate reads @xmath88 . in the same way ,",
    "generalization of the collective linewidth yields @xmath89 , whereas the plus ( minus ) sign holds for the anti - stokes ( stokes ) sideband .",
    "this implies that the threshold power for phonon laser action would drop by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "for off - resonant driving the collective behavior persits , the response function however gradually changes from an absorptive to a dispersive structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detuning ] .",
    "the resonant feature considerably broadens and decreases in amplitude .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior occurs for any number of oscillators and is not distinctive for the multimode system . in the here discussed case of frequency degeneracy ,",
    "the system of n mechanical oscillators with coupling rates @xmath90 is equal to a system of a single oscillator with a coupling rate of @xmath91 .",
    "in summary , we have derived and analyzed the emergence of superradiance and collective gain in optomechanical multimode systems . we have discussed the necessary conditions for these collective effects to occur and outlined the experimental feasibility . in the light of recent progress in on - circuit implementations of optomechanics @xcite , the experimental realization of the proposed system should be within reach .",
    "we showed that the system can easily be switched from a superradiant state , allowing enhanced cooling of a single vibrational mode , to a collective gain regime where phonon laser action @xcite with a single collective phononic mode is potentially possible .",
