    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite is one of the most important advancements in string theory .",
    "it provides a detailed correspondence between certain conformal field theories and geometries , and has led to remarkable new results on both sides .",
    "a large class of examples consists of type iib string theory on the background ads@xmath4 , where @xmath0 is a sasaki  einstein five  manifold and the dual theory is a four  dimensional @xmath5 superconformal field theory @xcite .",
    "this has recently led to considerable interest in sasaki  einstein geometry .",
    "recall that a _ sasakian _ manifold @xmath6 is a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath7 whose metric cone g_c(l ) = r^2 + r^2 g_l [ metcone ] is khler .",
    "@xmath6 is _ sasaki  einstein _ if the cone ( [ metcone ] ) is also ricci  flat .",
    "it follows that a sasaki  einstein manifold is a positively curved einstein manifold .",
    "the canonical example is an odd  dimensional round sphere @xmath8 ; the metric cone ( [ metcone ] ) is then @xmath9 with its flat metric .",
    "all sasakian manifolds have a canonically defined killing vector field @xmath10 , called the _ reeb _ vector field .",
    "this vector field will play a central role in this paper . to define @xmath10 note that , since the cone is khler , it comes equipped with a covariantly constant complex structure tensor @xmath11 . the reeb vector field",
    "is then defined to be = j(r )  . as a vector field on the link @xmath12",
    "this has norm one , and hence its orbits define a _ foliation _ of @xmath0 .",
    "either these orbits all close , or they do nt .",
    "if they all close , the flow generated by @xmath10 induces a @xmath13 action on @xmath0 which , since the vector field is nowhere  vanishing , is locally free .",
    "the orbit , or quotient , space is then a khler orbifold , which is a manifold if the @xmath13 action is actually free .",
    "these sasakian metrics are referred to as quasi  regular and regular , respectively .",
    "more generally , the generic orbits of @xmath10 might not close . in this case",
    "there is no quotient space , and the khler structure exists only as a transverse structure .",
    "the closure of the orbits of @xmath10 is at least a two  torus , and thus these so  called irregular sasakian metrics admit at least a two  torus of isometries .",
    "this will also be crucial in what follows .",
    "note that sasakian geometries are then sandwiched between two khler geometries : one of complex dimension @xmath14 on the cone , and one , which is generally only a transverse structure , of dimension @xmath15 . for sasaki  einstein manifolds ,",
    "the transverse metric is in fact _ khler ",
    "einstein_.    until very recently , the only explicit examples of simply  connected sasaki  einstein manifolds in dimension five ( equivalently complex dimension @xmath2 ) were the round sphere @xmath16 and the homogeneous metric on @xmath17 , known as @xmath18 in the physics literature . these are both regular sasakian structures , the orbit spaces being @xmath19 and @xmath20 with their khler",
    " einstein metrics .",
    "all other sasaki  einstein metrics , in dimension five , were known only through existence arguments .",
    "the remaining regular metrics are based on circle bundles over del pezzo surfaces @xmath21 , @xmath22 , equipped with their khler einstein metrics  these are known to exist through the work of tian and yau @xcite . on the other hand , boyer and galicki",

    "einstein metrics using existence results of kollr and collaborators for khler ",

    "see @xcite .    in references",
    "@xcite infinite families of explicit inhomogeneous sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics in all dimensions have been constructed .",

    "parameter cohomogeneity two family @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "provided the integers @xmath27 are chosen such that @xmath26 is smooth and simply  connected , these manifolds are all diffeomorphic to @xmath17 .",
    "further generalisations in complex dimension @xmath28 have appeared in @xcite .",
    "the metrics @xmath23 are quasi ",
    "regular when @xmath29 is a square .",
    "however , for general @xmath24 , they are _",
    "irregular_. these were the first examples of irregular sasaki  einstein manifolds , which in particular disproved the conjecture of cheeger and tian @xcite that irregular sasaki  einstein manifolds do not exist .      in general , the field theory duals of sasaki",
    " einstein five  manifolds may be thought of as arising from a stack of d3branes sitting at the apex @xmath30 of the ricci ",
    "flat khler cone ( [ metcone ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the calabi  yau geometry may be thought of as arising from the moduli space of the higgs branch of the gauge theory on the d3branes . through simple ads / cft arguments",
    ", one can show that the symmetry generated by the reeb vector field and the volume of the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold correspond to the r  symmetry and the @xmath3 central charge of the ads / cft dual superconformal field theory , respectively .",
    "all @xmath5 superconformal field theories in four dimensions possess a global r  symmetry which is part of the superconformal algebra .",
    "the @xmath3 central charge appears as a coefficient in the one  point function of the trace of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor on a general background .",
    "however , superconformal field theories with a sasaki  einstein dual have @xmath31 . ] , and its value may be computed exactly , once the r  symmetry is correctly identified . a general procedure that determines this symmetry is @xmath3maximisation @xcite .",
    "one defines a function @xmath32 on an appropriate space of potential ( or `` trial '' ) r  symmetries .",
    "the local maximum of this function determines the r  symmetry of the theory at its superconformal point .",
    "moreover , the critical value of @xmath32 is precisely the central charge @xmath3 of the superconformal theory .",
    "since @xmath32 is a cubic function with rational coefficients , it follows which is an isolated zero of a set of polynomials in the components of @xmath33 with _ rational _ coefficients .",
    "consider the galois group @xmath34 .",
    "this group fixes the set of polynomials , and thus in particular the galois orbit of the zeros is finite .",
    "an _ algebraic number _ may be defined as an element of @xmath35 with finite galois orbit , and thus we see that the components of the vector @xmath33 are algebraic numbers .",
    "we thank dorian goldfeld for this argument . recall also that the set of algebraic numbers form a field .",
    "thus , in the present example , the r  charges of fields being algebraic implies that the @xmath3central charge , which is a polynomial function of the r  charges with rational coefficients , is also an algebraic number . ] that the r  charges of fields are _ algebraic numbers _ @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates these r  charges to the volume of the dual sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold , as well as the volumes of certain supersymmetric three  dimensional submanifolds of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we have the relation @xcite =  . [ central ] since the left ",
    "hand side is determined by @xmath3maximisation , we thus learn that the volume of a sasaki  einstein five  manifold @xmath36 $ ] , relative to that of the round sphere , is an algebraic number",
    ". moreover , in the field theory , this number has been determined by a finite dimensional extremal problem .",
    "our aim in @xcite , of which this paper is a continuation , was to try to understand , from a purely _ geometrical _ viewpoint , where these statements are coming from .      given a sasaki  einstein manifold , it is in general a difficult problem to determine the dual field theory .",
    "however , in the case that the local calabi ",
    "yau singularity is _ toric _ there exist techniques that allow one to determine a dual gauge theory , starting from the combinatorial data that defines the toric variety . using these methods",
    "it has been possible to construct gauge theory duals for the infinite family of sasaki  einstein manifolds @xmath23 @xcite , thus furnishing a countably infinite set of ads / cft duals where both sides of the duality are known explicitly . indeed",
    ", remarkable agreement was found between the geometrical computation in the case of the @xmath23 metrics @xcite and the @xmath3maximisation calculation @xcite for the corresponding quiver gauge theories .",
    "thus the relation ( [ central ] ) was confirmed for a non  trivial infinite family of examples .",
    "further developments @xcite have resulted in the determination of families of gauge theories that are dual to the wider class of toric sasaki  einstein manifolds @xmath26 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    of course ,",
    "given this success , it is natural to try to obtain a general understanding of the geometry underlying @xmath3maximisation and the ads / cft correspondence . to this end ,",
    "in @xcite we studied a variational problem on a space of toric sasakian metrics .",
    "let us recall the essential points of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 be a toric khler cone of complex dimension @xmath14 .",
    "this means that @xmath1 is an affine toric variety , equipped with a conical khler metric that is invariant under a holomorphic action of the @xmath14torus @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath1 has an isolated singular point at the tip of the cone , the complement of which is @xmath39 .",
    "a conical metric on @xmath1 which is khler ( but in general not ricci  flat ) then gives a sasakian metric on the link @xmath0 .",
    "the moment map for the torus action exhibits @xmath1 as a lagrangian @xmath38 fibration over a strictly convex rational polyhedral cone lives in the dual lie algebra @xmath40 of the torus .",
    "] @xmath41 .",
    "this is a subset of @xmath42 of the form [ conehead ] ^ * = \\{y^n(y , v_a)0 ,  a=1,  ,d }  .thus @xmath43 is made by intersecting @xmath44 hyperplanes through the origin in order to make a convex polyhedral cone . here",
    "@xmath45 are coordinates on @xmath42 and @xmath46 are the inward pointing normal vectors to the @xmath44 hyperplanes , or _ facets _ , that bound the polyhedral cone .",
    "the condition that @xmath1 is calabi  yau implies that the vectors @xmath46 may , by an appropriate @xmath47 transformation of the torus , be all written as @xmath48 . in particular ,",
    "in complex dimension @xmath2 we may therefore represent any toric calabi  yau cone @xmath1 by a convex lattice polytope in @xmath49 , where the vertices are simply the vectors @xmath50 .",
    "this is usually called the toric diagram .",
    "note that the cone @xmath43 may also be defined in terms of its generating edge vectors @xmath51 giving the directions of the lines going through the origin .",
    "when @xmath2 the projection of these lines onto the plane with normal @xmath52 are the external legs of the so  called pq  web appearing in the physics literature .",
    "these are also weight vectors for the torus action and generalise to the non  toric case .    for a toric khler cone @xmath37",
    ", one can introduce symplectic coordinates @xmath53 where @xmath54 are angular coordinates along the orbits of the torus action , and @xmath55 are the associated moment map coordinates .",
    "these may be considered as coordinates on @xmath56 .",
    "the symplectic ( khler ) form is then = _",
    "i=1^n y_i _",
    "i  . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the metric degrees of freedom are therefore entirely encoded in the complex structure tensor @xmath11 ",
    "see @xcite for further details .    in @xcite",
    "we considered the space of all smooth toric khler cone metrics on such an affine toric variety @xmath1 .",
    "the space of metrics naturally factors into the space of reeb vector fields , which live in the interior @xmath57 of the dual done @xmath58 to @xmath43 , and then an infinite dimensional space of transverse khler metrics .",
    "a general reeb vector field may be written = _",
    "i=1^n b_i where @xmath59 . in this toric setting ,",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom in the metric are described by the space of all homogeneous degree @xmath60 functions on @xmath43 which are smooth up to the boundary ( together with a convexity requirement ) .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that the einstein ",
    "hilbert action on @xmath0 , restricted to this space of toric sasakian metrics on @xmath0 , reduces to the volume function vol@xmath61:\\mathcal{c}_0\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] , which depends only on the reeb vector field in @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , this is essentially just the euclidean volume of the polytope formed by @xmath43 and the hyperplane @xmath62 .",
    "this depends only on @xmath63 and the toric data @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath2 , we have the formula v(b ) = _ a=1^d = _ a=1^d [ toricvolume ] for the normalised volume of @xmath0 .",
    "the symbol @xmath65 denotes a @xmath66 determinant , while @xmath67 is the usual scalar product on @xmath42 ( or dual pairing between @xmath68 and @xmath40 , whichever the reader prefers ) .",
    "the function @xmath69 diverges to @xmath70 at the boundary @xmath71 of @xmath72  this is because the reeb vector field develops a fixed point set in this limit , as will be explained in section [ sectiontwo ] .",
    "once the critical reeb vector field @xmath73 is obtained one can compute the volume of the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold , as well as the volumes of certain toric submanifolds , without explicit knowledge of the metric . from the explicit form of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action , it follows that the ratios of these volumes to those of round spheres are in general algebraic numbers .",
    "this method of determining the critical reeb vector field , and the corresponding volume , has been referred to as `` @xmath74minimisation '' , where @xmath74 is just the restriction of the function @xmath69 to the hyperplane @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , the results of @xcite , for @xmath2 , were interpreted as the geometric `` dual '' of @xmath3maximisation for the case that the sasaki  einstein manifolds , and hence the superconformal gauge theories , were toric .",
    "an analytic proof of the equivalence of these two optimisation problems was given in the work of @xcite , modulo certain assumptions on the matter content of the field theory .",
    "the key point is that , following on from results in @xcite , the trial @xmath3function @xmath32 for the gauge theory may be defined in closed form in terms of the toric data , _",
    "i.e. _ the normal vectors @xmath64 , independently of the precise details of the gauge theory  for example the form of the superpotential .",
    "this is _ a priori _ a function of @xmath76 variables , the trial r  charges , where @xmath44 is the number of facets of the cone .",
    "the global baryonic symmetries are @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "once one maximises @xmath78 over this space , one is left with a function of two variables which geometrically are the components of the reeb vector field .",
    "rather surprisingly , the functions @xmath32 and @xmath79 are then identically equal .",
    "this of course explains why maximising @xmath3 in the field theory is the same as minimising @xmath74 in the geometry .",
    "further work on the relation between @xmath3maximisation and @xmath74minimisation has appeared in @xcite .",
    "the main result of the present work is to extend to general sasaki  einstein manifolds the toric results obtained in @xcite .",
    "this was initially a technical problem  some of the methods described above simply do not extend when @xmath1 is not toric .",
    "however , in the process of solving this problem , we will also gain further insight into the results of @xcite .",
    "we begin by fixing a complex manifold @xmath1 , which is topologically a real cone over a compact manifold @xmath0 .",
    "thus @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a coordinate on @xmath82 , and @xmath30 is always an isolated singular point of @xmath1 , unless @xmath0 is a sphere . for most of the paper it will be irrelevant whether we are referring to @xmath83 or the singular cone @xmath1 .",
    "this is because we shall mainly be interested in the sasakian geometry of the link @xmath0  the embedding into @xmath1 is then purely for convenience , since it is generally easier to work with the khler geometry of the cone . since we are interested in ricci",
    " flat khler metrics , we certainly require the canonical bundle of @xmath83 to be trivial .",
    "we implement this by assuming so defined is far from unique ",
    "one is always free to multiply by a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function .",
    "this is an important difference to the case of compact calabi",
    " yau manifolds .",
    "this degree of freedom can be fixed by imposing a `` homogeneous gauge '' for @xmath84 , as we discuss later .",
    "] we have a nowhere vanishing holomorphic @xmath85form @xmath84 on @xmath83 . by definition",
    "the singularity @xmath1 is therefore _",
    "gorenstein_. we also require there to be a space of khler cone metrics on @xmath1 .",
    "the space of orbits of every homothetic vector field @xmath86 in this space is required to be diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "the closure of the orbits of the corresponding reeb vector field @xmath87 defines some torus @xmath88 since @xmath10 is holomorphic .",
    "thus , as for the toric geometries above , we fix a ( maximal ) torus @xmath89 and assume that it acts isometrically on our space of khler cone metrics on @xmath1 . the reeb vector fields in our space of metrics",
    "are all required to lie in the lie algebra of this torus .",
    "note that there is no loss of generality in making these assumptions : the reeb vector field for a sasaki  einstein metric defines some torus that acts isometrically : by going `` off  shell '' and studying a space of _ sasakian _ metrics on which this torus ( or a larger torus containing this ) also acts isometrically , we shall learn rather a lot about sasaki ",
    "einstein manifolds , realised as critical points of the einstein  hilbert action on this space of metrics .",
    "the first result is that the einstein ",
    "hilbert action @xmath90 on @xmath0 , restricted to the space of sasakian metrics , is essentially just the volume functional @xmath36 $ ] of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we prove that [ percy ] = 4(n-1)(1 + -n)[l]where one can show that , for any khler cone metric , there exists a gauge in which @xmath84 is homogeneous degree @xmath91 under @xmath86 , where @xmath91 is unique .",
    "given any homothetic vector field @xmath86 , @xmath92 is another homothetic vector field for a khler cone metric on @xmath1 , where @xmath93 is any positive constant .",
    "setting to zero the variation of ( [ percy ] ) in this direction gives @xmath94 , since @xmath36 $ ] is homogeneous degree @xmath95 under this scaling .",
    "thus we may think of @xmath90 as the volume functional : = 4(n-1)[l]provided we consider only metrics for which @xmath84 is homogeneous degree @xmath14 under @xmath86 .",
    "this condition is the generalisation of the constraint @xmath75 in the context of toric geometries @xcite .",
    "the next result is that the volume of the link @xmath0 depends only on the reeb vector field @xmath10 , and not on the remaining degrees of freedom in the metric .",
    "the first and second derivatives of this volume function are computed in section [ varia ] : [ devies ] [ l](y)&= & -n_l ( y ) + ^2[l](y , z ) & = & n(n+1)_l ( y)(z )  .here @xmath96 are holomorphic killing vector fields in @xmath97 , the lie algebra of the torus @xmath98 , and @xmath99 denotes the contraction of @xmath100 with the one ",
    "form @xmath101 , the latter being dual to the reeb vector field .",
    "in particular , note that the second equation shows that @xmath36 $ ] is strictly convex  one may use this to argue uniqueness of critical points .",
    "we shall return to discuss the first equation in detail later .",
    "note that , when the background @xmath6 is sasaki  einstein , the right hand sides of these formulae essentially appeared in @xcite . in this context",
    "these formulae arose from kaluza ",
    "klein reduction on ads@xmath4 . in particular",
    ", we see that the first derivative @xmath102(y)$ ] is proportional to the coefficient @xmath103 of a two  point function in the cft , via the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this relates the geometric problem considered here to @xmath104minimisation @xcite in the field theory .",
    "since the torus @xmath98 acts isometrically on each metric , there is again a moment map and a fixed convex rational polyhedral cone @xmath105 .",
    "any reeb vector field must then lie in the interior of the dual cone @xmath72 to @xmath43 .",
    "the space of reeb vector fields under which @xmath84 has charge @xmath14 form a convex polytope @xmath106 in @xmath57  this is formed by the hyperplane @xmath75 in the toric case @xcite .",
    "the boundary of @xmath72 is a singular limit , since @xmath10 develops a fixed point set there .",
    "we again write the reeb vector field as = _",
    "i=1^s b_iwhere @xmath107 generate the torus action .",
    "the volume of the link is then a _ function _ [ voll ] [ l]:_0  .at this point , the current set ",
    "up is not dissimilar to that in our previous paper @xcite  essentially the only difference is that the torus @xmath98 no longer has maximal possible dimension @xmath108 .",
    "the crucial point is that , for @xmath109 , the volume function ( [ voll ] ) is no longer given just in terms of the combinatorial data specifying @xmath43 .",
    "it should be clear , for example by simply restricting the toric case to a subtorus , that this data is insufficient to determine the volume as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "the key step to making progress in general is to write the volume functional of @xmath0 in the form [ dhmeasure ] [ l ] & = & _ x e^-r^2/2 e^  .",
    "the integrand in ( [ dhmeasure ] ) may be interpreted as an equivariantly closed form , since @xmath110 is precisely the hamiltonian function for the reeb vector field @xmath10 .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ dhmeasure ] ) takes the form of the duistermaat ",
    "heckman formula @xcite .",
    "this may then be _ localised _ with respect to the reeb vector field @xmath10 .",
    "our general formula is : [ genvolume ] v(b ) = _ \\{f } _ f _ = 1^r ^-1  .since @xmath10 vanishes only at the tip of the cone @xmath30 , the right hand side of ( [ genvolume ] ) requires one to resolve the singular cone @xmath1  the left hand side is of course independent of the choice of resolution .",
    "this resolution can always be made , and _ any _ equivariant ( orbifold ) resolution will suffice , in an equivariant manner , by blowing up the fano orbifold @xmath111 associated to any quasi  regular khler cone structure on @xmath1 , as we shall explain later .",
    "it is interesting to note that , when constructing the gauge theory that lives on d3branes probing the conical singularity , one also makes such a resolution .",
    "specifically , an exceptional collection of sheaves on @xmath111 may then , in principle , be used to derive the gauge theory ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the first sum in ( [ genvolume ] ) is over connected components of the fixed point set of the @xmath98 action on the resolved space @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath113 are weights of the @xmath98 action on the normal bundle to each connected component @xmath114 of fixed point set .",
    "these essentially enter into defining the moment cone @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath115 are chern classes of the normal bundle to @xmath114 .",
    "the term @xmath116 denotes the order of an orbifold structure group ",
    "these terms are all equal to @xmath60 when the resolved space @xmath112 is completely smooth .",
    "precise definitions will appear later in section [ localsection ] .",
    "we also note that the right hand side of ( [ genvolume ] ) is homogeneous degree @xmath95 in @xmath63 , precisely as in the toric case , and is manifestly a rational function of @xmath63 with rational coefficients , since the weight vectors @xmath117 and chern classes @xmath118 ( and @xmath119 ) are generally _",
    "rational_. from this formula for the volume , which recall is essentially the einstein ",
    "hilbert action , it follows immediately that the volume of a sasaki  einstein manifold , relative to that of the round sphere , is an algebraic number .",
    "when the complex dimension @xmath2 , this result is ads / cft `` dual '' to the fact that the central charges of four dimensional superconformal field theories are indeed algebraic numbers .    when @xmath1 is toric , that is the torus action is @xmath14dimensional , the formula ( [ genvolume ] ) simplifies and reduces to a sum over the fixed points of the torus action over any toric resolution of the khler cone : [ newtoricvolume ] v(b ) = _ p_ap _ i=1^n  . here",
    "@xmath120 are the vertices of the polytope @xmath121 of the resolved toric variety  these are the very same vertices that enter into the topological vertex in topological string theory .",
    "the @xmath122 , @xmath123 , are the @xmath14 primitive edge vectors that describe the @xmath124th vertex .",
    "the right hand side of formula ( [ newtoricvolume ] ) is of course necessarily independent of the choice of resolving polytope @xmath121 , in order that this formula makes sense .",
    "it is a non  trivial fact that ( [ newtoricvolume ] ) is equivalent to the previous toric formula for the volume ( [ toricvolume ] ) .",
    "for instance , the number of terms in the sum in ( [ newtoricvolume ] ) is given by the euler number of any crepant resolution  that is , the number of gauge groups of the dual gauge theory ; while the number of terms in ( [ toricvolume ] ) is @xmath44  that is , the number of facets of the polyhedral cone .",
    "however , it can be shown that ( [ newtoricvolume ] ) is finite everywhere in the interior @xmath57 of the polyhedral cone @xmath72 , and has simple poles at the facets of @xmath72 , precisely as the expression ( [ toricvolume ] ) .",
    "these formulae show that the volumes of general sasakian manifolds , as a function of the reeb vector field , are _",
    "topological_. for toric geometries , this topological data is captured by the normal vectors @xmath46 that define @xmath43 . for non  toric geometries ,",
    "there are additional chern classes that enter .",
    "in fact , we will also show that these formulae may be recovered from a particular limit of an equivariant index on @xmath1 , which roughly counts holomorphic functions according to their charges under @xmath98 .",
    "specifically , we define c(q , x ) = \\{q^0(x ) }  .here @xmath125 lives in ( a subspace of ) the algebraic torus associated to @xmath98 , and the notation denotes a trace of the induced action of this torus on the space of holomorphic functions on @xmath1 .",
    "this equivariant index is clearly a holomorphic invariant , and the volume of the corresponding sasakian link will turn out to appear as the coefficient of the leading divergent term of this index in a certain expansion : [ donald ] v(b ) = _",
    "t0 t^n  c(q=(-tb),x )  .the character @xmath126 has a pole of order @xmath14 at @xmath127 , @xmath123 , and this limit picks out the leading behaviour near this pole . for regular sasaki  einstein manifolds this relation , with critical @xmath73 , was noted already in @xcite  the essential difference here is that we interpret this relation as a _ function _ of @xmath63 , by using the equivariant index rather than just the index .",
    "this result is again perhaps most easily described in the toric setting . in this case",

    "some indices counting bps operators of superconformal field theories have been introduced and studied .",
    "in contrast to the equivariant index defined here , those indices take into account states with arbitrary spin .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that the index considered here is equivariant means that it is twisted with respect to the global flavour symmetries of the gauge theory .",

    "the reeb vector field then lies in the centre of the lie algebra of @xmath137 .",
    "this gives a rigorous account of the expectation that flavour symmetries of the field theory must be realised as isometries of the dual geometry , and that the r  symmetry does not mix with non  abelian flavour symmetries .",
    "let us conclude this outline with an observation on the types of algebraic numbers that arise from the volume minimisation problem studied here .",

    "although we have obtained explicit expressions for the volume function @xmath69 , it seems to be a non  trivial fact that one obtains algebraic numbers of such low degree obeying ( [ conje ] ) from extremising this function  _ a priori _ , the degree would seem to be much larger",

    "this is to go back to the isomorphism ( [ iso ] ) .",
    "the splitting of @xmath313 into differential forms of different degrees is realised on the space of spinors @xmath309 via the clifford action of the khler form @xmath157 .",
    "the latter splits the bundle @xmath309 into eigenspaces = _ a=0^n _ awhere @xmath707 is an eigenspace of @xmath708 with eigenvalue @xmath709 .",
    "moreover , @xmath710 and _ a ^0,a(x )  .",
    "recall now that @xmath315 corresponds to a section of @xmath711 under the isomorphism ( [ iso ] ) ; hence @xmath315 has eigenvalue @xmath712 under the clifford action of @xmath157 .",
    "indeed , one can check this eigenvalue rather straighforwardly , without appealing to the isomorphism ( [ iso ] ) .",
    "we may now consider @xmath706 .",
    "since @xmath100 is holomorphic and killing , it preserves @xmath157 .",
    "thus the clifford action commutes past the lie derivative , and we learn that @xmath706 has the same eigenvalue as @xmath315 .",
    "but since this eigenbundle is one  dimensional , they must in fact be proportional : @xmath713 for some function @xmath114 .",
    "thus ( [ cute ] ) says that 0 = 2f|^c_(n)=2fk  .since @xmath137 is certainly non  zero , we conclude that @xmath714 , and we are done .",
    "in this appendix we derive the first and second variation formulae ( [ firstder ] ) , ( [ secondder ] ) .      recall that we linearise the equations for deforming the reeb vector field around a given background khler cone with khler potential @xmath143 .",
    "we set ( t ) & = & + t y[bone ] + r^2(t ) & = & r^2(1+t )  .we work to first order in @xmath373 . note that contracting ( [ bone ] ) with @xmath11 we have r(t)=r - tj(y )  .expanding _",
    "r(t)/r(t)r^2(t)=2r^2(t)to first order in @xmath373 gives _",
    "r / r= 2_j(y)r = -2(y )  .recall we also require _",
    "( t)r^2(t)=0which gives , again to first order , [ diffphixi ] _",
    "= -2r(y)=0  .in particular , note that when @xmath715 we recover that @xmath264 should be homogeneous degree zero and basic , and thus gives a transverse khler deformation .",
    "note also that the right hand side of ( [ diffphixi ] ) is zero if and only if @xmath100 is a holomorphic killing vector field of the background .",
    "we may use these equations to compute the derivative of the volume @xmath36 $ ] , which we think of as @xmath716 $ ] , in the direction @xmath100 .",
    "we write this as @xmath102(y)$ ] . arguing much as in section [ ehaction ] , we obtain [ jarvis ] [ l](y ) = -n_l + _",
    "r1^c(r^2 )  .the first term arises from the variation of the domain , as in equations ( [ domainchange ] ) , ( [ domainchange2 ] ) .",
    "however , one must be careful to note that here @xmath717 is a function of both @xmath142 and the point @xmath187 , where @xmath0 is the unperturbed link @xmath158 .",
    "we must integrate up to the hypersurface @xmath374 , which one can check is , to first order in @xmath373 , given by @xmath718 .",
    "thus one should replace @xmath264 by @xmath719 in ( [ domainchange ] ) .",
    "using stokes theorem on the second term on the right hand side of ( [ jarvis ] ) , the first term is cancelled , as before , leaving [ l](y ) = _ l ^c  .now ^c= _ r / r= -2(y)[b10]where in the last equality we have used the linearised equation .",
    "we thus have [ l](y)= -n_l(y)which is formula ( [ firstder ] ) in the main text .      we now take the second variation of the volume . we write [ l](y ) = -n(n+1)_r1(^c r^2)(y)[b12]as described in the main text .",
    "we now again deform r^2(t ) & = & r^2(1+t ) + r(t ) & = & r- tj(z)giving linearised equations [ linguy ] _",
    "r / r & = & -2(z ) + _ & = & -2r(z)=0  .in fact the second equation again will not be used .",
    "the derivative of ( [ b12 ] ) gives [ boris ] ^2[l](y , z ) & = & _ l ( y ) -_r1(^c(r^2))(y ) + & -&_r1 2r^2(y ) ^c(r^2 )  .the three terms occur from the variation in domain , the variation of @xmath720 , and the variation of the measure , respectively . the last term in ( [ boris ] ) may be integrated by parts , with respect to @xmath721 , giving the two terms [ johnson ] -_l ( y)^c(r^2 ) -_r1(y)^c(r^2 )  , where we have used @xmath722 .",
    "expanding the first term in ( [ johnson ] ) , with respect to @xmath153 , gives [ bach ] -_l ( y)+_l(y)(z )  .to produce the form of the second term in ( [ bach ] ) , we have used the trick ( [ b10 ] ) of writing the linearised equation ( [ linguy ] ) as @xmath723 .",
    "now , the first term in ( [ bach ] ) precisely cancels the first term in ( [ boris ] ) .",
    "hence we are left with & & ^2[l](y , z ) = _ l(y)(z ) + & & -_r1(^c(r^2))(y)+ y^c(r^2 )  .finally , we note the identity 0 & = & y + & = & ( ^c(r^2))(y)-^c(r^2 ) y  .thus we have shown that ^2[l](y , z ) = n(n+1)_l ( y)(z)which is equation ( [ secondder ] ) in the main text .",
