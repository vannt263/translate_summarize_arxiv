    "<S> many models beyond the standard model predict unwanted relics , which should be diluted by entropy production such as inflation and subsequent reheating . among other things , weakly interacting massive scalar fields will be the most problematic , as they can store their energy density in the form of coherent oscillation , which may not be diluted by inflation because the coherent mode during the inflationary epoch is generally displaced from its value in the true vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> an example is a problem associated with moduli fields of string theory , named the cosmological moduli problem @xcite . in string theory coupling constants are determined dynamically by vacuum expectation values of the moduli ( and dilaton ) fields . </S>",
    "<S> these fields generically acquire masses comparable to the gravitino mass , which should be in the tev range in gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> damped coherent oscillation and subsequent decay of the fields would spoil the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . </S>",
    "<S> late - time entropy production before the bbn should operate to dilute the energy density of the problematic scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> indeed thermal inflation was proposed @xcite , for which reheat temperature should be much lower than the electroweak scale for a successful dilution .    </S>",
    "<S> another example of the problematic scalar fields is an invisible axion with decay constant larger than @xmath0 gev , whose coherent oscillation would exceed the critical density of the universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entropy production may be able to dilute the energy density of the axion field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the oscillation of the axion field starts around the qcd phase transition , the reheat temperature at the entropy production should be lower than 100 mev . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly it has been argued that strongly coupled @xmath1 heterotic string theory ( m - theory ) possesses such an axion candidate with the decay constant @xmath2 gev , provided that non - perturbative effects to generate the superpotential for the axion field are suppressed @xcite . to dilute the energy density of the m - theory axion to a harmless level , the reheat temperature of the entropy production should be at its lowest value allowed by the bbn , 110 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the requisite entropy production is provided by decays of massive unstable particles . </S>",
    "<S> the decays , however , may produce too many stable particles as well if the production is kinematically allowed . in a supersymmetric theory , </S>",
    "<S> the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , which is likely to be a neutralino , is stable under the assumption of @xmath3-parity conservation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it was argued that the neutralinos produced by the decays of the massive particles tend to overclose the universe , if the reheat temperature is much lower than 1 gev @xcite .    motivated by the aforementioned demands for the late - time entropy production mechanism , we shall reexamine the problem of the relic abundances of the neutralinos which are produced by the decays of massive unstable particles . </S>",
    "<S> given an annihilation cross section of the neutralinos , we will solve coupled equations numerically to evaluate the relic abundances , taking into account effects of exponential decays of the unstable particles , whereas an approximation of simultaneous decay was made in the previous works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that results obtained in our numerical calculation agree with the previous estimates up to a numerical factor of order unity and hence we confirm the validity of arguments in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that our computation should be applicable to any stable weakly - interacting - massive - particles . </S>",
    "<S> we will then argue that the stable lsp suffers from the overclosure problem in most of the parameter space if the reheat temperature is of the order of 10 mev or less . </S>",
    "<S> we will also briefly mention possible implications of our analysis when there remains the m - theory axion in the massless spectrum of the heterotic m - theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the situation that massive unstable particles @xmath4 of the decay width @xmath5 come to dominate the energy density of the universe , then decay to neutralinos @xmath6 as well as to radiation with branching ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . by assuming two - body decay , the energy density of @xmath6 just after the production is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> they subsequently lose their energy , by the scattering with thermal bath , down to @xmath10 . assuming this energy transportation occur rapidly </S>",
    "<S> , we define the effective branching ratio @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> time evolution of cosmic scale factor @xmath3 and energy densities @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 of @xmath4 , radiation , and @xmath6 , respectively , are described by the following friedmann equation and ( integrated ) boltzmann equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the reduced planck mass : it is related to the newton s constant as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an ensemble - averaged annihilation cross section of neutralinos times their relative velocity . we treat @xmath18 as a constant , which is indeed the case when the @xmath19-wave is dominant . when a higher partial wave dominates , on the other hand , @xmath18 should be interpreted as a sort of weighted average in the time interval around when the annihilation process is important . in the above equations </S>",
    "<S> , we did not include pair production of the neutralinos , which is not effective at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> note that the right - hand side of the boltzmann equation for @xmath13 is consistent with the energy conservation within comoving volume for the case @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> following  @xcite we introduce the dimensionless variables : @xmath21^{-1/2 }    \\\\    & &    \\rho_{\\chi 0 } \\equiv \\frac{m_{\\chi}\\gamma}{\\mean{\\sigma v } } ~,\\quad    f_{\\chi 0 } \\equiv \\rho_{\\chi 0}/\\rho_{\\phi i } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here subscripts @xmath22 mean their initial values . by using these variables , </S>",
    "<S> the coupled differential equations above can be written as follows : @xmath23 where prime denotes @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we impose the following initial conditions at @xmath25 , @xmath26    there is no difficulty in solving the boltzmann equation for @xmath27 : @xmath28    by assuming @xmath29 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical calculation shows that @xmath33 is about @xmath34 larger than the estimate @xmath35 .    with an approximation of the simultaneous @xmath4 decay at @xmath36 , one obtains @xmath37 numerical calculation  @xcite for the coupled equations shows , on the other hand , @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the formula above is correct also for larger @xmath41 and/or @xmath42 with at most about @xmath34 error .    </S>",
    "<S> our main concern in this paper is @xmath43 for @xmath44 , to which @xmath14 is proportional . </S>",
    "<S> a crude behavior of @xmath43 can be seen as follows . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath45 is negligibly small , or quantitatively if @xmath46 as we shall see shortly , @xmath47 that is , @xmath43 increases monotonically with @xmath48 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath49 is not so small the second term of the boltzmann equation for @xmath43 can not be neglected when @xmath43 becomes large : @xmath50 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus when @xmath51 , @xmath43 increases until @xmath52 , but decreases thereafter to reach @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath54    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the evolution of @xmath43 , obtained by integrating out the coupled differential equations numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it shows it increases till @xmath55 or so , then decreases to reach a constant value . in the same figure </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the evolutions of the other quantities , @xmath56 , @xmath27 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare our numerical results with a naive estimate given in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this naive estimation of @xmath58 for the case where the annihilation process becomes effective was obtained by equating the annihilation rate @xmath59 to the expansion rate @xmath60 at the decay epoch ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath4 , with the approximation of the simultaneous decay . </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath61 or , @xmath62 on the other hand , we find the following fit for our numerical results ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) : @xmath63 for @xmath64 within @xmath65 error . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the two results shows that the naive estimate is correct up to a factor of order unity in a wide range of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 becomes larger , @xmath58 is more underestimated if one uses the naive estimation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 while , @xmath72    now we turn to @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for entropy density . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the effective relativistic degrees of freedom , we find @xmath77 substituting our numerical results eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : f - r : numerical ] ) and ( [ eq : f - chi : numerical ] ) , we obtain the following fit @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ratio of the critical density @xmath80 to the entropy density @xmath74 at present . </S>",
    "<S> this formula reproduces values of @xmath73 calculated numerically within @xmath65 error for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the annihilation cross section is related to the relic abundance as @xmath82 one finds that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sigma - v ] ) agrees with the previous estimate in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , up to a factor of order unity , if one recalls the temperature when @xmath4 decays is @xmath83 which may be referred to as the reheat temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble - averaged annihilation cross section ( times relative velocity ) @xmath18 can be , in general , expanded in the averaged velocity squared @xmath84 of the lsp : @xmath85 the coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath87 , _ etc . _  strongly depend on the composition of the lsp as well as superparticle mass spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes the coefficient @xmath86 of the @xmath19-wave becomes very small due to the majorana nature of the neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case when the lsp is the bino - dominant neutralino , in which @xmath86 is proportional to the mass squared of the fermion in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> then , in order to evaluate @xmath18 and subsequently @xmath88 , we have to know @xmath84 precisely . the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found that the bino - dominant lsp is likely to reach kinetic equilibrium and thus @xmath89 when the reheat temperature @xmath90 is somewhat high , @xmath91 a few @xmath92 10 mev . using this value of @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> , they concluded that the lsp would overclose the universe as far as the reheat temperature is lower than a few hundred mev . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear , however , whether the lsp is in the equilibrium or not for other sets of parameters . without detailed knowledge of the velocity distribution , there are still some conclusions we can draw in general . for instance , in view of the fact that the annihilation cross section is generally bounded from above </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath93 we may conclude that the lsp with the mass at a few tens gev or more does not annihilate sufficiently enough to survive the overclosure limit , if the reheat temperature is relatively low , say @xmath94 mev , or @xmath95 sec , which seems to be required to make the m - theory axion viable . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bound ( [ eq : cross - bound ] ) does not apply when @xmath74-channel resonances ( by @xmath96 boson or higgs bosons ) occur . to discuss the relic abundance in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that we need to evaluate the velocity distribution of the lsp , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we would like to discuss implications of our analysis to the m - theory if it turns out that the axion with large decay constant indeed arises . </S>",
    "<S> one needs to invoke an entropy production mechanism to dilute the energy density of the axion s coherent oscillation , unless its initial amplitude can be tuned to be very small . </S>",
    "<S> as we argued , the entropy production would produce too many neutralinos , if kinematically allowed , which would not annihilate efficiently . as a result they would overclose the universe , if they remain today . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that r - parity should be violated , making the neutralino - lsp unstable . </S>",
    "<S> of course there are many loopholes to this argument , and we would not insist that the r - parity must be broken in the heterotic m - theory . </S>",
    "<S> rather we regard the r - parity violation as in interesting option to which more attention should be paid . </S>"
