    "dedicated narrow - band searches for ly-@xmath0 emitters have proven to be very efficient at detecting high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. hu & mcmahon 2003 ) .",
    "objects found by this technique have to be confirmed spectroscopically , to rule out possible low redshift interlopers that may arise due to emission lines other than ly-@xmath0 falling within the targetted wavelength interval .",
    "nevertheless , a significant fraction of the detections appear to be bona - fide ly-@xmath0 emitters , and the number of objects accumulated to date by this technique in the redshift interval @xmath1 is quite impressive . the ly-@xmath0 emission line is also found in a significant fraction of lyman break galaxies ( e.g. which are selected on the basis of their continuum emission .",
    "the ubiquity of the ly-@xmath0 line is at face value surprising , given that it is resonantly scattered by atomic hydrogen , and so is easily absorbed by even a small amount of dust in a neutral gaseous medium .",
    "it is suspected that most ly-@xmath0 emitters have galactic winds ( as is the case with lyman break galaxies ) which allow ly-@xmath0 photons to escape from the galaxy after only a limited number of resonant scatterings ( kunth 1998 ; pettini 2001 ) .",
    "the ly-@xmath0 line typically shows an asymmetric profile characteristic of such a process ( e.g. ahn 2004 ) .",
    "the physics of this phenomenon is complicated , however , and remains poorly understood .",

    "the following steps are taken to compute the ly-@xmath0 emission from a model galaxy : ( i ) the number of lyman continuum photons is computed from the star formation history in the model galaxy and the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . in the baugh ( 2004 ) model , quiescent star formation in galactic disks produces stars with a kennicutt ( 1998 ) imf , whereas bursts of star formation triggered by galaxy mergers produce a flat ( `` top - heavy '' ) imf .",

    ", we simply assume that a fixed fraction , @xmath8 , of ly-@xmath0 photons escape from the galaxy . physically , this might arise if a fraction of the ly-@xmath0 photons escape through holes in the galactic gas and dust distribution . in the second approach",
    ", we calculate the absorption of ly-@xmath0 photons by a diffuse dust medium having the same spatial distribution as the stars , ignoring resonant scattering by neutral hydrogen .",
