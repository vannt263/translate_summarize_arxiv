    "we introduce the operator calculus necessary to present our approach to ( local ) inversion of analytic functions . it is important to note that this is different from lagrange inversion and",

    "rota @xcite is well - known for his _ umbral calculus",
    "_ development of special polynomial sequences , called _ basic sequences . _ from our perspective , these are  canonical polynomial systems \" in the sense that they provide polynomial representations of the heisenberg - weyl algebra , in realizations different from the standard one .",
    "our idea @xcite is to illustrate explicitly the rle of vector fields and their duals , using operator calculus methods for working with the latter ( in our volumes  this viewpoint is prefigured in @xcite ) .",
    "the main feature of our approach is that the action of the vector field may be readily calculated while the action of the dual vector field on exponentials is identical to that of the vector field .",
    "then we note that acting iteratively with a vector field on polynomials involves the complexity of the coefficients , while acting iteratively with the dual vector field always produces polynomials from polynomials .",

    "the operator of multiplication by @xmath0 is given by @xmath48 , which is a _ recursion operator _ for the system .",
    "we identify vector fields with first - order partial differential operators .",
    "consider a variable @xmath49 with corresponding partial differential operator @xmath50 .",
    "given @xmath46 as above , let @xmath51 be the vector field @xmath52 .",
    "then we observe the following identities @xmath53 as any operator function of @xmath5 acts as a multiplication operator on @xmath54 .",
    "the important property of these equalities is that @xmath44 and @xmath51 commute , as they involve independent variables .",
    "so we may iterate to get    @xmath55    on the other hand , we can solve for the left - hand side of this equation using the method of characteristics .",
    "namely , if we solve @xmath56 with initial condition @xmath57 , then for any smooth function @xmath58 , @xmath59 thus @xmath60 to solve equation ( [ eq : vf ] ) , multiply both sides by @xmath61 and observe that we get @xmath62 integrating yields @xmath63 or , writing @xmath64 for @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 we can set @xmath67 to get @xmath68 on the one hand while @xmath69 in summary , we have the expansion of the exponential of the inverse function @xmath70 or @xmath71 this yields an alternative approach to inversion of the function @xmath31 rather than using lagrange s formula .",

    "an important feature of our approach is that to get an expansion to a given order requires knowledge of the expansion of @xmath84 just to that order .",
    "the reason is that when iterating @xmath103 , at step @xmath15 it is acting on a polynomial of degree @xmath104 , so all terms of the expansion of @xmath105 of order @xmath15 or higher would yield zero acting on @xmath106 .",
    "this allows for streamlined computations .    for polynomial systems",

    "inversion of the chebyshev polynomial @xmath133 can be used as the basis for solving general cubic equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "to get started we have , with @xmath134 , @xmath135 so @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , etc .",
    "we find @xmath139    in this case , we can find the expansion analytically . to solve @xmath140 ,",
    "write @xmath141 invert to get , for integer @xmath142 , @xmath143 , with @xmath144 denoting the principal branch",

    "we can formulate an alternative matrix computation as follows .",
    "let @xmath193 and @xmath194 denote the matrices of the operators of differentiation and multiplication by @xmath0 respectively on polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath15 .",
    "the space is invariant under differentiation , and we cut off multiplication by @xmath0 to be zero on @xmath195 . we get @xmath196 with the first row of @xmath194 all zeros .",
    "we then compute the matrix @xmath194 times @xmath197 , where @xmath197 is computed as a matrix polynomial by substituting in @xmath198 up to order @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath44 has a matrix representation , @xmath199 , on the space and we iterate multiplying by @xmath200 acting on the unit vector @xmath201 .",
