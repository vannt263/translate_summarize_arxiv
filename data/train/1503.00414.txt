    "standard searches at the large hadron collier ( lhc ) , generally referred to ones based on multiple energetic visible objects and large missing transverse energy , have not observed any susy signatures .",
    "if lightest superparticles are well separated in mass , e.g. by more than one typical standard model energy scale @xmath3 , lower bounds on colored superparticles are already about 0.6 - 1.5 tev  @xcite .",
    "perhaps , it is especially perplexing if one suspects that susy solves the weak - planck scale hierarchy problem naturally through sub - tev superparticles .    given the criticality of understanding the susy naturalness , it is also intriguing to ponder as many ways as possible for sub - tev superparticles responsible for the naturalness to be hidden from standard searches . of various possibilities studied , models with compressed  @xcite or stealth  @xcite superparticle spectrum , r - parity violations ( rpv )  @xcite and long - lived decays of superparticles  @xcite are relatively weakly constrained .",
    "the neutral naturalness paradigm  @xcite applied to susy  @xcite is another conceivable direction .",
    "although lighter superparticles do not necessarily imply improved naturalness , the discovery and the test of these models can often be possible only with dedicated theoretical and experimental studies ",
    "they are not guaranteed with mere increase of data .    in this paper , we discuss relatively unexplored possibilities of `` untracked susy signals '' that may evade standard searches at the lhc and allow lighter superparticles presumably more consistent with naturalness .",

    "[ sec : kink ] and [ sec : atr ] .",
    "fully realistic simulation studies are well beyond the scope of our work , but we aim to introduce and illustrate the signatures .",

    "although details are somewhat different between atlas and cms , both experiments essentially use calorimeter clusters and associated ( same direction within resolutions ) tracks altogether for these procedures .",

    "after jet candidates are reconstructed , they are further qualified to have , e.g. , agreeing calorimeter energy and associated track momentum  @xcite  that is what normal jets have .",
    "the requirement implicitly assumes that the jet already has good associated tracks .",
    "a good track is the one originated from the primary interaction vertex ( pv ) with a transverse impact parameter @xmath4 mm and many enough innermost tracker hits  @xcite . if the track has a larger @xmath5 or is even not reconstructed / associated , the jet is disqualified and those events are _ rejected _ in standard susy searches  @xcite .",
    "it is because they are abundantly produced from non - collisional backgrounds such as cosmic rays , instrumental effects or multiple beam interactions .",
    "what about charged leptons ?",
    "the qualification cut on the lepton track is tighter on @xmath6 mm  @xcite .",
    "if leptons are not qualified , their calorimeter clusters and tracks are passed to jet reconstruction .",

    ", one type of untracked signals , in general , is a track or a calorimeter cluster appearing in the middle of i d or calorimeters .",
    "it is produced when a neutral particle travels a macroscopic distance and decays in i d or calorimeters to a charged particle plus another charged particle unobservably soft or missing in the detector .",
    "the daughter calorimeter cluster ( a jet candidate ) is likely to be disqualified then because tracks associated with it have too large @xmath5 ( not pointing at pv ) or are not reconstructed at all .",
