    "the excitation of charge carriers by ac electric field in noncentrosymmetric semiconductor structures may lead to a direct electric current even in the absence of dc driving . in the high - frequency spectral range ,",
    "when mechanisms of the current formation involve quantum optical transitions , such effects are usually referred to as photogalvanic effects  @xcite . at present , they are intensively studied in various low - dimensional systems and provide the insight into the band structure details as well as the kinetics of photoexcited carriers  @xcite . in the classical frequency range , i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the field frequency and @xmath2 is the mean kinetic energy of carriers , the photogalvanic effects can be fruitfully treated as nonlinear electron transport and included in the more general class of quantum ratchets ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the ratchet transport of charge carriers induced by ac electric field was studied both theoretically and experimentally for semiconductor structures with artificially fabricated asymmetric scatterers  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been addressed theoretically for bulk wurtzite crystals and low - symmetry quantum wells ( qws ) based on zinc - blende - lattice compounds  @xcite .",
    "however , the proposed mechanisms of the current formation require the multiband mixing of states and , therefore , vanish in the effective - mass approximation .    here",
    ", we show that in conventional quantum wells , where the space inversion is lifted by structure asymmetry , the ratchet transport of free carriers emerges in the simple one - band model of size - quantized states .",
    "we develop a microscopic model and an analytical theory of the direct current generation by ac electric field , which are valid for the classical range of the field frequency .",
    "it is shown that the electric current emerges for both linear and circular polarization of the ac field and its magnitude depends on the radiation frequency .",
    "we also study the effect of an in - plane static magnetic field on the electron transport and show that the magnetic field gives rise to additional contributions to the dc current which have different polarization dependences . for simplicity ,",
    "we neglect spin splitting of the conduction band and focus on the orbital mechanisms of the current formation .",
    "phenomenologically , the density of direct current @xmath3 induced by ac electric field is described by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the complex amplitude of the electric field @xmath6 assumed to be homogeneous , the indices @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 enumerate the cartesian coordinates , and components of the tensors @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfy the relations @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , which follow from the reality of the current density @xmath3 .",
    "the third - rank tensor @xmath11 describes the photogalvanic effect ( or high - frequency nonlinear conductivity ) .",
    "the model and miscroscopic theory of this effect are presented in sec .",
    "the forth - rank tensor @xmath12 is responsible for additional current contributions emerging in the presence of an external static magnetic field @xmath15 ; they are addressed in sec .",
    "we consider a semiconductor quantum well with structure inversion asymmetry and assume that the well is isotropic in the interface plane ( @xmath16 point - group symmetry ) .",
    "straightforward symmetry analysis yields that the in - plane dc current in such structures can be induced only by ac field which has both the in - plane @xmath17 and out - of - plane @xmath18 components .",

    "in contrast , @xmath22 stands for the radiation - helicity dependent electric current vanishing for the linearly polarized radiation .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is nothing but a component of the pseudovector @xmath25=|\\bm{e}|^2 ( \\bm{q}/q ) p_{circ}$ ] , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the wave vector and the circular polarization degree of the electromagnetic wave .",

    "the structure inversion asymmetry is modeled here by placing the @xmath10-layer of impurities ( dotted line ) closer to the lower interface rather than exactly in the qw center",
    ". however , the microscopic model presented below is also valid for qws where nonequivalence of @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions is achieved by the asymmetry of confinement potential .     generation by ( a ) linearly polarized and ( b ) circularly polarized ac electric field @xmath28 in a quantum well.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ figure1]a sketches the mechanism of dc current generation by linearly polarized ac field , i.e. , when the in - plane @xmath32 and out - of - plane @xmath33 components are co - phased .",
    "the in - plane oscillating field @xmath32 causes an alternating current of electrons along the @xmath34 axis .",
    "the time - average value of the force @xmath35 acting upon carriers is zero , therefore , dc current driven solely by the in - plane electric field would vanish .",
    "however , the electric field @xmath28 has also the out - of - plane component @xmath33 which oscillates at the same frequency and acts upon the charge carriers as well .",
    "the force @xmath36 pushes the carriers to the upper or lower interface depending on the force direction and thereby changes the electron wave function along the qw normal @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "[ figure1]a .",
    "such time dependence of the envelope function @xmath37 results , in turn , in the modulation of the electron mobility @xmath38 at the frequency @xmath1 because the impurities , which determine the mobility , are shifted off the qw center in our model .",
    "therefore , when the carriers are driven in one direction in the qw plane their mobility and , hence , the drift velocity @xmath39 are higher than those a half period later when the carriers flow in the opposite direction .",
    "such an asymmetry in the drift of charge carriers along @xmath34 and @xmath40 directions implies a non - vanishing dc electric current .    for circularly polarized ac electric field ( fig .",
    "[ figure1]b ) , the in - plane and out - of - plane components of @xmath28 are phase - shifted by @xmath41 : the component @xmath33 reaches maximum when @xmath32 is zero and vice versa .",
    "now , the time - average product @xmath42 vanishes and no dc current emerges in the static limit @xmath43 . the time - average flow of carriers along the @xmath34 axis is obtained only at finite frequency if one takes into account the retardation of the drift velocity @xmath44 with respect to the in - plane field @xmath32 . indeed , as is well known from the classical drude theory of high - frequency conductivity , @xmath44 does not follow @xmath45 exactly but is behind the field with the retardation phase shift of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the momentum relaxation time .",
    "due to the retardation , the carriers keep moving in the qw plane even when @xmath48 and the field component @xmath33 efficiently affects the mobility , see fig .",
    "[ figure1]b .",
    "similarly to the case of linearly polarized field , such modulation of the mobility leads to a time - average drift current along the @xmath34 axis .",
    "an interesting feature of dc current induced by circularly polarized ac field is that the current direction is opposite for right - handed ( @xmath49 ) and left - handed ( @xmath50 ) polarization .",
    "indeed , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 polarizations the phase shift between the field components @xmath32 and @xmath33 has opposite sign .",
    "therefore , the inversion of radiation helicity changes the sign of the mobility oscillations and reverses the electric current .",
    "the expression for dc electric current can be readily derived in the framework of the classical drude theory . in this approach",
    ", time evolution of the in - plane drift velocity @xmath44 is found from the newton equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the effective mass and @xmath53 is the rate of velocity relaxation which depends on time due to the effect of out - of - plane field component @xmath33 on the function of size quantization , see fig .",
