    "the quantum hall ( qh ) effect  @xcite occurs when an incompressibility , _",
    "i.e. _ , a discontinuity in the dependence of chemical potential @xmath1 on density , occurs at a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system ( es ) sheet density @xmath2 that is magnetic - field @xmath3 dependent . the qh effect at integer landau - level filling factors @xmath4 arises from the quantization of 2d es kinetic energy and from the macroscopic degeneracy of landau - level states with a particular kinetic energy .",
    "( @xmath5 is known as the magnetic length . ) the fractional qh effect ( chemical potential jumps at fractional values of @xmath6 ) , on the other hand , does not occur in a non - interacting electron system , and is due to constraints on the correlations@xcite that can be achieved among electrons that have the same quantized kinetic energy .",
    "a necessary consequence@xcite of magnetic - field dependence in @xmath2 is the existence of states in the chemical - potential gap that are localized at the edge of a finite - size system and carry equilibrium current @xmath7 with the property @xmath8.@xcite these edge - electron systems are obviously one - dimensional and , since they carry an equilibrium current , obviously chiral.@xcite microscopically,@xcite the edge of a non - interacting electron system at integer filling factor @xmath9 is equivalent , at low energies , to a one - dimensional electron system with @xmath10 flavors of fermions that can travel only in one direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 chiral fermion branches .",
    "it was argued some time ago,@xcite on the basis of trial wavefunctions for finite - size systems , that the edges of incompressible _ fractional _ qh states can also be described microscopically as chiral one - dimensional electron fluids that have , in general , an unequal number of inequivalent left - moving and right - moving branches . in a series of beautiful papers based on hydrodynamic and field - theoretic considerations",
    ", wen@xcite proposed and developed the idea that the properties of fractional qh edges could be described using a generalization of the bosonization approach that was developed earlier for conventional one - dimensional electron systems@xcite and provides a simple description of their characteristic@xcite _ luttinger - liquid _ power - law correlation functions . in wen s theory , edge excitations can be described microscopically in terms of a number of chiral boson fields , and the resulting edge system is a _ chiral luttinger liquid _ ( @xmath11ll ) . finite - size numerical calculations  @xcite have been a useful tool in verifying the fundamentally bosonic character of the edge - excitation spectrum and in testing some experimental predictions of @xmath11ll theory .",
    "further experimental evidence in support of some aspects of @xmath11ll theory is summarized below .",
    "there are , however , difficulties in reconciling this effort to capture generic aspects of the microscopic physics of fractional qh edges with experimental observations .",
    "early work@xcite did appear to imply that the edge structure of qh systems at the laughlin series of filling factors , _",
    "i.e. , _ for @xmath12 with positive integer @xmath13 , is rather well - described in terms of a single - branch @xmath11ll characterized by a power - law exponent @xmath14 , as expected on the basis of @xmath11ll considerations .",
    "recently , however , this universal dependence of @xmath15 on filling factor has been questioned both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite in addition , tunneling density - of - states observations@xcite at hierarchical filling factors , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 with integer @xmath17 are in apparent contradiction with the predictions@xcite of @xmath11ll theory .",
    "motivated by this stark experimental discrepancy , we re - examine in this paper a key _ ansatz _ of @xmath11ll theory , which has appeared to us to be non - obvious@xcite and concerns the properties of the operator @xmath18 obtained from the full microscopic electron creation operator @xmath19 by _ projecting _ onto the low - energy sector of edge excitations : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the projection operator onto the fock - space subset of low - energy ( edge ) excitations @xmath22 , discussed at greater length below . in applying @xmath11ll theory to evaluate electronic correlation functions , the representation of @xmath23 in terms of bosonic edge - density fluctuations is a key ingredient .",
    "such bosonization identities can be derived constructively@xcite for a conventional one - dimensional electron system.@xcite their generalization to the fractional - qh case,@xcite in which there is no adiabatic connection to non - interacting electron states , must however be based on appealing but heuristic physical arguments that , ultimately , have to be verified by experiment , or by numerical calculations . in our view",
    "it is not clear beyond any doubt that the bosonized forms of @xmath24 that have been used in @xmath11ll theory to evaluate electronic correlation functions and predict observables , like the power - law exponents in tunneling current - voltage characteristics , are always correct .",
    "in particular , an important guiding principle that has been used to limit possible bosonized expressions for electron field operators in @xmath11ll theory is the seemingly obvious requirement that they satisfy fermi statistics . in this paper , we use finite - size exact diagonalization studies of a short - range - interaction model to directly test the fermi - statistics _",
    "ansatz_. the subset of fock - space states that represent edge excitations of this model can , for the most part , be identified convincingly .",
    "_ we demonstrate by explicit calculation of some anticommutator matrix elements that electron creation operators projected onto this low - energy fock space do not satisfy fermi anticommutation rules . _ in section  [ num ] of this paper , the numerical calculations that support this claim are described in detail .",
    "section  [ boscons ] discusses the problem of understanding the properties of the projected electron creation operator and of finding a useful expression for it in terms of edge boson fields , in light of our numerical finding .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concl ] with a brief summary .",
    "a preliminary report on this work was presented earlier.@xcite",
    "the second - quantized operator @xmath25 [ @xmath26 that creates [ annihilates ] 2d electrons in the lowest landau level obeys anticommutation relations that encode the fundamental antisymmetry condition satisfied by many - fermion wavefunctions : @xmath27 the question we address in this section is whether the anticommutation relations are still satisfied after _ projection _ onto the low - energy ( long - wavelength ) sectors of fock - space that represent edge excitations of particular incompressible states . because of the projection , eq .",
    "( [ commut ] ) does not mathematically guarantee the relation @xmath28 a physical argument along the following lines does , however , appear plausible .",
    "it is possible to add two different electrons to the system at low energies that are localized at different positions along the edge via processes that can be represented by the projected creation operator .",
    "the edge - electron positions can then be adiabatically interchanged , ending up with an equivalent many - fermion state that must differ only by a sign from the original state .",
    "if the many - particle state can be represented , at all intermediate relative positions , by two projected creation operators acting on the starting state , it seems hard to escape the conclusion that these operators must satisfy fermi statistics .",
    "however , the correlations that establish the bulk gap could be disturbed when the two electrons are in close proximity .",
    "it is therefore difficult to exclude the possibility that this argument breaks down at the crossing point in the exchange path .",
    "related arguments can be advanced in which the exchange paths involve particle creation at different times , but do not appear to us to be conclusive . our inability to settle this point on the basis of simple general arguments",
    "has motivated the numerical calculations we now explain .",
    "the identification of the set of states as edge excitation states of a particular incompressible state in a finite - size many - fermion spectrum is both a challenge and an important source of uncertainty for the conclusions we reach . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the identification is accomplished@xcite by appealing to laughlin@xcite to conclude that the low - energy edge - excitation states appear at angular momenta above @xmath30 , and that the dimension of subspaces at fixed angular momentum is related to their excess momentum by counting the number of modes in a chiral boson hilbert space;@xcite _ i.e. _ , one state with angular momentum 1 , two with angular momentum 2 , three with angular momentum 3 , five with angular momentum 4 , _",
    "et cetera_. previous numerical work@xcite has verified @xmath11ll predictions for @xmath29 edges , but not at filling factors within the range @xmath31 , where experiment and theory appear to be at odds .",
    "incompressibilities at many other values of the filling factor , _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath16 with positive integer @xmath10 , have been explained using various hierarchical schemes@xcite and using composite - fermion theory.@xcite composite - fermion theory and variational wavefunctions based on hierarchy - theory ideas make identical predictions@xcite for the values of total angular momentum @xmath32 at which _ maximum - density_@xcite incompressible states ( those with edge subsystems in their ground states ) appear and for the number and chirality of the boson branches in their edge - excitation spectra . for practical reasons explained more fully below , we limit our study to qh systems with two branches of edge excitations that have the same _ chirality _ , _ i.e. _ , that propagate along the edge in the same direction and have , for our circular droplets , excess angular momenta of the same sign .",
    "this is the case for qh systems at filling factors @xmath33 where the edge spectrum is expected to be that of two boson modes that share the same chirality .",
    "the angular - momentum values at which maximum - density states occur depend on the number of electrons @xmath34 , and the number of particles to be transferred from the ground to the upper composite - fermion landau level @xmath35 .",
    "this notation is chosen to suggest the analogous hierarchy - picture description of the same states , which makes identical predictions for the set of angular - momentum values at which maximum - density states occur . in the composite - fermion language , the number of particles in the lower composite - fermion landau level is @xmath36 , and _ maximum - density _ finite - size @xmath37 states appear at @xmath38 , where the last term comes from the jastrow factor in jain s variational wavefunctions and the first term reflects the reduced angular momentum of higher landau - level states.@xcite changing @xmath39 and/or @xmath34 is analogous to a _",
    "topological _ or _ zero - mode _ excitation in a finite - size one - dimensional electron system.@xcite we denote the n - electron state with @xmath39 quasiparticles and an edge - density sub - system in its ground state by @xmath40 , and its total momentum by @xmath41 .",
    "the following relation can be derived from the above composite - fermion expression or from hierarchy theory : @xmath42    .total angular momenta @xmath43 for the ground state of compact fractional - qh systems as predicted from eq .",
    "( [ hierpred ] ) for @xmath44 .",
    "these states can be regarded as @xmath34-electron states in the lowest landau level that consist of a qh droplet at filling factor @xmath45 supporting a compact daughter droplet of @xmath39 quasiparticles . in an equivalent description ,",
    "these are @xmath34-composite - fermion states with lowest and first - excited composite - fermion landau levels having occupation @xmath46 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "numbers in bold type indicate that the corresponding ground state in our numerical spectra was positively identified as a finite - size @xmath0 qh state .",
    "the ground states whose edge - excitation sectors are explicitly used here to test the fermi statistics _",
    "ansatz _ are indicated by asterisks .",
    "[ momenta ] [ cols=\"^,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     our numerical results are summarized in table  [ restab ] .",

    "i.e. _ , states with @xmath47 .",
    "( see the first row in table  [ restab ] . )",
    "although only one case is presented there , it turns out that for _ any _ finite - size system with short - range interactions , the electron operator projected onto the subspace of low - energy excitations above the ground state at @xmath48 satisfies fermi statistics _ exactly_. the fermi statistics of edge excitations is a property of laughlin many - body wavefunctions,@xcite which are exact in the case of the hard - core - interaction model at @xmath49.@xcite it is apparent from the remaining entries in table  [ restab ] that this property of hard - core - model single - branch qh edges does not , in general , hold in the @xmath50 two - branch case .",
    "we have tested edge - excitation subspaces for systems with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 electrons and find that the ratio @xmath53 that ` measures ' fermi statistics often differs substantially from @xmath54 . instead",
    ", a strong dependence of @xmath53 on the change in @xmath35 that accompanies particle addition is apparent from our data .",
    "for example , consider the sequences @xmath55@xmath56@xmath57 where particles are added without adding hierarchy quasiparticles . in composite - fermion language , this corresponds to adding electrons to the lowest composite - fermion landau level only .",
    "the finite sequences in this class that we have studied , _",
    "e.g. _ , 355170 , 517092 , and 6687111 , are gathered in the first block of table  [ restab ] .",
    "although violations of fermi statistics are numerically unambiguous , they are large only for those cases where the edge sector is seriously incomplete ( only 5 out of 10 edge states could be identified in the l=38 sector for the sequence 223551 ) .",
    "to some extent , this result is not surprising since the addition of an electron to the lowest composite - fermion landau level is expected to involve excitations of this level only , as in the @xmath48 case .",
    "it seems plausible that the results should be similar .",
    "the deviation from fermi statistics is suspicious , however , when contrasted with the perfect accuracy seen for the @xmath48 qh droplet . when an anticommutator involving @xmath58 ( increasing the number of higher - landau - level composite fermions by one ) is considered , as in the sequences 395166 , 567087 , and 7692 - 111 ( see the third block in table  [ restab ] ) , the deviations from fermi statistics are larger .",
    "note that some of the _ same _ finite - size edge states are used here and in the @xmath59 case for which fermi statistics is more closely approximated .",
    "it is important to recognize , however , that the edge sectors used in all these sequences are not complete even for the larger systems considered .",
    "the incompleteness is related to the fact that there are only two electrons in the first excited composite - fermion landau level which implies that the _ daughter _ droplets are substantially smaller than the parent droplets , exacerbating finite - size difficulties .",
    "the strongest evidence that fermi - statistics relations are not satisfied comes from the remaining sequences in table  [ restab ] , for which the numerical edge - state sector is usually complete .",
    "there is no unique way of estimating a thermodynamic limit for @xmath53 from our data .",
    "a consistent scheme would have to keep @xmath60 as @xmath61 , in order to maintain parent and daughter fluids that are similar in size .",
    "the small system sizes tractable using current numerical methods render such an extrapolation impossible .",
    "examining the trends in table  [ restab ] , however , we are reasonably confident that differences @xmath62 are significant and not merely due to finite - size effects .",
    "_ we note that in the case of conventional one - dimensional electron systems , a corresponding calculation would always result in exact conformation with fermi statistics ; there are no finite - size corrections .",
    "_ the @xmath48 hard - core - model case also produces results in agreement with fermi statistics without finite - size corrections .",
    "in contrast , our calculations exhibit large deviations from fermi statistics for many sequences where the edge states expected for a two - branch boson system are clearly resolved in the spectrum , not only for those with an incomplete edge sector .",
    "this is the case for 516687 for example .",
    "furthermore , when edge states exist that have energies above the gap for bulk excitations and can no longer be clearly identified ( this is the case , e.g. , for 8-particle states at total momentum 73 ) , the value of @xmath53 turns out to be determined almost entirely by contributions from edge states with energies below the gap .",
    "inclusion of any number of states ( bulk or edge ) above the gap energy changes @xmath53 only by a few percent .",
    "finally , deviations from fermi statistics do not seem to diminish with increasing particle number . on the contrary , the more unambiguously identified edge - state sectors at larger @xmath34 yield values of @xmath53 that differ consistently from @xmath54 , especially for anticommutators involving the component of the creation operator that increases the number of daughter quasiparticles , @xmath63 .",
    "our numerical results clearly support a multi - branch chiral - boson form for the excitation spectrum of a fractional - qh edge , but raise new questions about the representation of projected electron creation operators in terms of these boson fields .",
    "this issue is discussed in the following section .",
    "we start by carefully examining the arguments that have been made in @xmath11ll theory to obtain bosonization identities . some of these heuristic arguments must be ruled out if the edge projection of the electron operator does indeed not satisfy fermi statistics .",
    "alternative proposals are discussed , but we have not been able to find a simple form that is consistent with our numerical results , suggesting that the true expression may not be universal .    in a conventional one - dimensional system,@xcite the low - energy projection of the electron operator @xmath64",
    "is expressed as the sum @xmath65 of right - moving and left - moving chiral fermion contributions @xmath66 .",
    "for these chiral fermion operators , an identity relating them to the bosonic charge fluctuations of an interacting system can be derived rigorously.@xcite fractional - qh edges _ do _ appear to be realizations of chiral one - dimensional systems , as indicated by the multiplicity of low - lying many - electron states in our numerically obtained spectra .",
    "given this observation , one is tempted to push the analogy further and search for a bosonization identity for the projected edge - electron operators @xmath67 . assuming that it is _ local _ in the angular coordinate @xmath68 along the edge",
    ", it should read @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes a normalization constant .",
    "the ` klein factor ' @xmath71 is a ladder operator that connects many - particle ground states , @xmath72 and commutes with bosonic edge - density operators . the correct commutation relations for operators with _ different _",
    "@xmath73 , whatever they are , have to be encoded in these factors .",
    "the chiral phase field @xmath74 is a superposition of edge - density fluctuations . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the following decomposition of the phase field in terms of eigenmodes is always possible : @xmath76 were @xmath77 is the phase field of the charged _ edge - magnetoplasmon _ mode which corresponds to fluctuations in the total edge - charge density , and @xmath78 is its orthogonal complement , the so - called neutral mode .",
    "the prefactor @xmath79 of the charged mode in eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) is mandated by the fact that the addition of an electron necessarily increases total electric charge by unity .",
    "additional assumptions are necessary , however , to fix the values of @xmath80 .    within @xmath11ll",
    "theory,@xcite the operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 are believed to be special in that they create electrons localized at the putative ` outer ' and ` inner ' edges which are the boundaries of the outer parent and inner daughter qh droplets with filling factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 $ ] , respectively , that comprise the @xmath75 qh state .",
    "the density fluctuations at the ` outer ' and ` inner ' edges are given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , and the definition of charged and neutral modes implies that    @xmath87    the addition of electrons to the edge with concomitant change of @xmath88 flux quanta is viewed as adding the electron to the ` outer ' edge and transferring _ at the same location _ @xmath73 fractionally charged quasiparticles from the outer qh droplet to the inner one .",
    "this suggests the relation @xmath89 which is equivalent to @xmath90    the chain of arguments leading to eq .",
    "( [ allowed ] ) involves several assumptions that are not obviously satisfied .",
    "for example , it is not clear why changes in @xmath35 that accompany electron addition have to occur by transferring localized quasiparticles from an ` inner ' edge to an ` outer ' one . relaxing",
    "this condition would lift the restriction expressed by eq .",
    "( [ allowed ] ) .",
    "in fact , two of the present authors suggested the different choice @xmath91 for strongly correlated fractional - qh edges.@xcite the fact that eq .",
    "( [ allowed ] ) ensures fermi statistics has been regarded@xcite as strong support for this line of argument .",
    "however , the numerical results discussed in sec .  [ num ] suggest that there is no basis for this requirement . assuming that a simple bosonization identity of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ simpbos ] ) holds , we can extract the values @xmath92 and @xmath93 from the data for matrix elements of anticommutators @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "( see the appendix for details of the calculation . )",
    "the value of @xmath96 deviates significantly from that expected within @xmath11ll theory ( @xmath97 ) because @xmath98 does not satisfy fermi statistics .",
    "while the standard deviations from the average extracted @xmath99 are reasonably small , we have to caution the reader by noting that the assumption of a simple bosonization identity would imply symmetry of @xmath100 under exchange @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , no such symmetry is exhibited in our data .",
    "the significantly large deviation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 raises a big question mark : unless rather complex features are ascribed to the klein factors , a consistent interpretation of our data using a local bosonization formula like eq .",
    "( [ simpbos ] ) is impossible .",
    "we have shown , by explicit numerical calculation of anticommutator matrix elements , that the projection of the lowest - landau - level electron creation operator onto the low - energy edge - excitation fock subspace of a @xmath0 incompressible quantum hall state does _ not _ satisfy fermi statistics .",
    "we observe a consistent dependence of the anticommutation rules on the particular procedure for adding electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the change in quasiparticle number that accompanies particle addition .",
    "we find that the numerical data can not be consistently interpreted by assuming any simple generalization of conventional bosonization identities .",
    "in particular , the expression for the electron operator solely in terms of rigid edge deformations ( magnetoplasmon modes ) , which two of us argued for previously@xcite on heuristic grounds is also not supported by our calculations .",
    "since our present study was performed for a system with short - range interactions , however , we can not exclude the possibility that real qh samples where long - range coulomb interactions are present may be consistently described by such a bosonization identity , as is suggested by the amazing experimental finding that the tunneling-@xmath104 exponent @xmath105 .",
    "our numerical study demonstrates that the specific form of the boson representation of the edge electron creation operator can not be inferred by postulating fermi statistics of the projected edge - electron operator .",
    "alternatives@xcite to the @xmath11ll expressions@xcite can not be ruled out on these general grounds .",
    "however , our present data for the short - range - interacting case supports neither the conventional chiral - luttinger - liquid picture nor any simple alternative .",
    "this points strongly towards the possibility that there is no simple universal _ local _ bosonization identity for the edge - electron operator , a conclusion also reached in an independent recent study.@xcite if true , this likely implies that electronic properties of fractional - quantum - hall edges depend crucially on sample specifics .",
