    "the mid - infrared spectra of low metallicity dwarf galaxies are well - known to differ from those of spirals , with weaker polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features and higher [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] ratios @xcite .",
    "this may be due to harder interstellar radiation fields ( isrfs ) in dwarfs because of lower dust extinction , leading to pah destruction @xcite , or to delayed creation of carbon dust by agb stars in dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these differences are reflected in the mid - infrared broadband colors of dwarfs , which show depressed 8 @xmath0 m emission relative to 24 @xmath0 m , compared to spirals @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as a weakening of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature in dwarfs .",
    "dwarf and spiral spectral energy distributions also differ at longer wavelengths ; spiral spectra peak in the far - infrared , while dwarf spectra peak at shorter wavelengths , @xmath325 @xmath1 60 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "this implies warmer large dust grains in dwarf galaxies on average .",
    "low metallicity galaxies also tend to have lower total dust - to - gas mass ratios than higher metallicity systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spitzer [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] broadband colors of irregular / sm galaxies also differ from those of spirals , being redder on average @xcite .",
    "this color difference , however , has proven more difficult to interpret . since the 3 @xmath1",
    "5 @xmath0 m radiation from galaxies may be a combination of starlight and interstellar emission , it can be difficult to accurately disentangle the contributions from these components to the observed broadband fluxes .",
    "@xcite suggested that this reddening is due to younger stars in irr / sm galaxies compared to spirals , with hotter stars having redder [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors .",
    "in general , hotter stars tend to have redder l @xmath1 m colors ( @xmath4[3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] ) than cooler stars @xcite .",
    "alternatively , these color differences have been attributed to hot dust in dwarf galaxies contributing at 4.5 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the br@xmath2 line may also contribute significantly to the 4.5 @xmath0 m band @xcite .",
    "in addition , the nebular continuum in the infrared can also contribute significantly at wavelengths @xmath5 3 @xmath0 m in low metallicity systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another factor may be the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah feature , which contributes to the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer band .",
    "a lower heavy element abundance , and therefore less pahs , can redden the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color .",
    "also , stars with low metal abundances may have redder colors because of less line blanketing in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band ( m. cohen 2006 , private communication ) . evolved stars can also redden this color , for example , miras are 1 @xmath1 2 magnitudes redder in l @xmath1 m than non - variable optically - bright stars @xcite . in highly obscured systems , reddening due to dust extinction can also be important even in the spitzer bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to determine the origin of the red [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors in dwarf galaxies , for a large sample of dwarfs we have collected spitzer mid - infrared fluxes , metallicities , and ground - based optical , near - infrared , and radio measurements from the literature . combining these data with population synthesis modeling ,",

    "non - stellar contributions to the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer band are investigated . in section 9 ,",
    "the question of hot dust contributions at 4.5 @xmath0 m is discussed .",
    "morphology is discussed in section 10 , while luminosity and stellar mass are investigated in section 11 .",
    "some additional issues are discussed in section 12 , and conclusions are presented in section 13 .",
    "to investigate how the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color depends upon metallicity and other properties of dwarf galaxies , we collected spitzer 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath0 m fluxes from the literature for a sample of 71 irregular , blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) , sm , sd , and other dwarf galaxies , for which oxygen abundances are available .",
    "this sample is not complete in any sense , however , it spans a large range of metallicity , absolute magnitude , spitzer luminosities , and gas content .",

    "[ 4.5 ] published colors , we downloaded the spitzer archival images and checked the published values . for all except the bluest galaxy in the sample , ugc 4483 , the colors we obtained agreed with the published colors within @xmath40.15 magnitudes . for ugc 4483 , however , our [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color is @xmath10.16 , compared to @xmath10.39 from @xcite . for this galaxy",
    ", we used our fluxes rather than the published numbers .",
    "we also collected total - galaxy 21 cm hi and h@xmath2 fluxes for the sample galaxies . we also used h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratios from the literature , preferably global ( total - galaxy ) values when possible ; otherwise , we used smaller aperture measurements .",
    "in addition , we searched for both total - galaxy and smaller aperture br@xmath2 and br@xmath7 measurements .",
    "we also obtained h@xmath6 equivalent widths and measurements of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature optical depth for our sample galaxies , preferring global values over small aperture measurements when available . in table 1 , for each type of data , we give the number of galaxies with such data available .",
    "we also obtained total - galaxy optical ubvri and near - infrared jhk broadband fluxes for our sample from the literature .",
    "these magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction , when necessary , and converted to jy using the zero points in @xcite . in a number of cases ,",
    "large discrepancies were found between different published magnitudes for the same galaxy . in these cases , we did not use either measurement in our analysis .    as a comparison sample of spiral galaxies",
    ", we started with the sample of nearby ` normal ' ( not strongly interacting ) spirals discussed in @xcite .",
    "these galaxies have total - galaxy spitzer infrared and ground - based optical and near - infrared broadband fluxes available from @xcite .",
    "most have total h@xmath2 fluxes available from @xcite , and pa@xmath2/h@xmath2 ratios for the inner 50@xmath8 available from @xcite . as spirals tend to have radial abundance gradients , for comparison to the dwarfs we selected spirals which have disk - averaged oxygen abundances available @xcite . after removing sd galaxies ,",
    "there are 13 galaxies in the spiral sample .",
    "in the left panel of figure 1 , we compare the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color against oxygen abundance for our sample dwarf galaxies .",
    "the right panel shows the same plot for the spirals .",
    "the dwarfs are on average redder in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] , in addition to having lower metallicities . for the dwarfs ,",
    "a relation is seen , in that colors redder than [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] @xmath9 0.3 are only seen at low abundances , log(o / h ) + 12 @xmath10 8.2 ( @xmath11 0.5 solar ) .",
    "in contrast , the spirals all have [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] @xmath4 0.0 , and disk - averaged log(o / h ) + 12 @xmath9 8.2 .    for the dwarfs ,",
    "there is considerable scatter in figure 1 . to test whether this scatter is due solely to differing amounts of interstellar matter , with more gas - rich galaxies having a larger amount of dust and therefore more 4.5 @xmath0 m excess , in figure 1 we color - coded the data points according to their m(hi ) @xmath1 [ 3.6 ]",
    "color , where m(hi ) is the magnitude in the 21 cm hi line @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hi mass for the dwarfs range from 7 @xmath12 10@xmath13 m@xmath14 to 7 @xmath12 10@xmath15 m@xmath14 . in this plot ,",
    "as log(o / h ) increases , m(hi ) @xmath1 [ 3.6 ] tends to increase ( i.e. , the hi mass to 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosity ratio m@xmath16/l@xmath17 decreases ) .",
    "this is consistent with results of previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which show that lower metallicity systems tend to be richer in hi relative to their stellar mass .",
    "however , for a given metallicity , no strong trend of m(hi ) @xmath1 [ 3.6 ] with [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] is found .",
    "thus the 4.5 @xmath0 m excess does not appear to be due to an increasing mass fraction of interstellar matter .",
    "this result is uncertain , however , because molecular gas is not included in this plot .",
    "many of these galaxies are undetected in co , the standard tracer of molecular gas in galaxies , and the amount of molecular gas present is uncertain .    in figure 2",
    ", we compare the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of these galaxies with the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 24 ] colors .",
    "the left panel shows the dwarfs , the right the spirals . in this figure",
    ", we have color - coded the data points as a function of oxygen abundance .",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m luminosity is considered a good tracer of star formation rate , as it arises from small dust grains heated by uv photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the 3.6 @xmath0 m flux is mainly due to older stars , then [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 24 ] is roughly a measure of the mass - normalized star formation rate , and therefore the intensity of the uv field .",
    "figure 2 shows that indeed more intense uv fields are correlated with more 4.5 @xmath0 m excess .",
    "the distributions of the spirals and the dwarfs overlap in figure 2 , but the dwarf sample extends to much redder [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 24 ] colors as well as redder [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors than the spirals .",
    "the dwarf galaxies with the redder colors tend to have lower metallicities , however , some low metallicity galaxies have blue spitzer colors . thus low metallicity appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for red [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] and [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 24 ] colors .",
    "to test whether stars alone can account for the variations in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors , we used the starburst99 stellar population synthesis code @xcite to produce model stellar colors in these bands .",
    "we used version 5.1 of this code , which includes the padova asymptotic giant branch stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "we note that this code does not model red supergiants in low metallicity systems well @xcite , which introduces some uncertainty to our results .",
    "we used a grid of models with ages that range from 1 myrs to 20 gyrs , and metallicities of 1/50 , 1/5 , 1/2.5 , 1 , and 2.5 times solar .",
    "dwarf galaxies have a large range of mass - normalized star formation rates ; some are undergoing violent bursts of star formation , while others have low current rates @xcite .",
    "the integrated ubv colors of dwarf irregular galaxies are generally consistent with constant star formation rates @xcite .",
    "blue compact dwarf galaxies are undergoing recent starbursts , but an older population is usually also present @xcite . as limiting cases to the true star formation histories of the galaxies , we therefore ran both continuous and instantaneous burst star formation models .",
    "we integrated the starburst99 model spectra over the spitzer bandpasses and calculated the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors . in figure 3 , we plot model [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors vs.age for various metallicities . in figure 3 , we only include stellar contributions to the spitzer fluxes ; no dust emission or interstellar gas emission lines are included .",
    "the models shown in figure 3 also do not have reddening due to dust extinction included ( see section 6 ) .",
    "color corrections are also not included , as these are expected to be very small ( see irac data manual ) . in the top panel ,",
    "we present instantaneous burst models , while the bottom panel shows continuous star formation models .",
    "figure 3 shows that , according to starburst99 , there is a relatively small spread in the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of stars of different ages and metallicities , @xmath100.2 magnitudes .",
    "as expected , there is a trend such that younger ( @xmath106 @xmath12 10@xmath13 myrs ) and lower metallicity systems ( except @xmath52.5 z@xmath14 ) have redder colors than intermediate age systems ( @xmath1010@xmath18 myrs ) .",
    "however , the spread in colors is quite small , and can not account for the full range of observed colors for dwarfs . except for very young ( @xmath105 myrs ) models with greater than solar metallicity ,",
    "the model stellar colors are between @xmath10.16 and 0.04 . of our dwarf galaxies ,",
    "70% are redder than this limit .",
    "thus the observed range in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of dwarfs is not due solely to variations in star colors due to age and metallicity variations .",
    "in this section , we estimate the importance of the br@xmath2 line at 4.05 @xmath0 m , which may contribute significantly to the spitzer 4.5 @xmath0 m band ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for example , in the galactic h  ii region m17 , br@xmath2 is estimated to contribute 20% of the total 4.5 @xmath0 m broadband flux @xcite . at low metallicities , stars are hotter and therefore more ionizing photons are available for the same mass of stars .",
    "thus as metallicity decreases , for the same star formation rate the h@xmath2 and br@xmath2 fluxes are expected to increase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to determine how much br@xmath2 can affect the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color , we added br@xmath2 to the starburst99 models shown in figure 3 .",
    "we used the h@xmath2 fluxes provided by starburst99 , along with a nominal br@xmath2/h@xmath2 ratio of 0.0273 ( 10,000 k , case b ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then added this model br@xmath2 flux to the starburst99 stellar spectrum and integrated over the spitzer bandpasses to get model colors . in figure 4 , we plot the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] model color including br@xmath2 against age , with different metallicity models plotted with different symbols .",
    "these models do not include dust extinction or emission , or other interstellar lines besides br@xmath2 .",
    "a comparison of figure 4 to figure 3 shows that , in some very young systems , br@xmath2 can contribute significantly , particularly for low metallicity systems .",
    "for example , for ages @xmath10 10 myrs and a metallicity of 1/50 solar , br@xmath2 may redden the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color by @xmath51 magnitude .",
    "a higher assumed temperature will decrease this reddening somewhat .    a more direct way to determine the br@xmath2 contribution to the observed 4.5",
    "@xmath0 m flux is to either measure it directly , or to extrapolate from br@xmath7 or h@xmath2 measurements .",
    "only one galaxy in our sample , ii zw 40 , had a total - galaxy br@xmath2 flux available @xcite . from this measurement , we find that only @xmath411% of the spitzer 4.5 @xmath0 m flux of ii zw 40 is due to br@xmath2 .",
    "another galaxy in our sample has a total - galaxy published br@xmath7 flux available ( sbsg 0335 - 052 ; @xcite ) . using the small - aperture spectroscopic br@xmath2/br@xmath7 flux ratio from @xcite and @xcite to extrapolate to the total br@xmath2 flux",
    ", we estimate that the br@xmath2 contribution to the 4.5 @xmath0 m spitzer flux for this galaxy is @xmath431% .",
    "this may be an over - estimate , since some of the br@xmath7 flux may arise in less extincted regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for ngc 5253 , the br@xmath2 measurement of @xcite in a 10@xmath8 @xmath12 20@xmath8 aperture gives a lower limit to the br@xmath2 contribution to the spitzer 4.5 @xmath0 m flux of 2@xmath19 .",
    "this aperture is considerably smaller than the optical angular size for ngc 5253 of @xmath42@xmath20 @xmath12 5@xmath20 given in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) and the observable extent of the 3.6 @xmath0 m emission in the archival spitzer image of @xmath41@xmath20 @xmath12 2@xmath20 .",
    "however , the infrared emission is strongly centrally peaked in the archival spitzer images , with 25@xmath19 of the total 3.6 @xmath0 m flux and 47@xmath19 of the 4.5 @xmath0 m flux within a 10@xmath8 @xmath12 10@xmath8 region .",
    "thus the br@xmath2 contribution to the 4.5 @xmath0 m flux is likely not much more than 4 @xmath1 8@xmath19 for ngc 5253 .    for galaxies with published total - galaxy h@xmath2 measurements",
    ", we estimate the br@xmath2 contribution indirectly from these fluxes , correcting for internal extinction using the published h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratio . from the extinction - corrected h@xmath2 flux",
    ", we calculated the br@xmath2 flux , and determined the fraction of the observed 4.5 @xmath0 m broadband flux due to br@xmath2 .",
    "this calculation shows that , if the h@xmath2/h@xmath6 estimates of extinction are appropriate , for our sample galaxies the fraction of the observed spitzer flux due to br@xmath2 ranges from 0.3% to 23% , with most ( 80% ) having less than 10% of their total 4.5 @xmath0 m flux due to br@xmath2 . in some cases",
    ", h@xmath2/h@xmath6 may underestimate the extinction ( see section 6 ) , thus these percentages are lower limits .",
    "we then re - calculated the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of the galaxies , after removing the flux due to br@xmath2 . in the left panel in figure 5 , for the dwarf galaxies with published h@xmath2 fluxes , we plot the metallicity against both the observed and the br@xmath2-removed [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors . for the galaxies with measured br@xmath2 or br@xmath7 ,",
    "we plot two br@xmath2-corrected values , one calculated using the h@xmath2 ( filled red squares ) and one using the br@xmath2 or br@xmath7 value ( open green triangles ) . in figure 5 , we mark the range in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] expected from starlight alone , @xmath10.16 @xmath10 [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] @xmath10 0.04 ( see figure 3 ) . the correction for br@xmath2 shifts the galaxies to the left , to bluer [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors , with the shifts ranging from 0 @xmath1 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "note that for ii zw 40 and sbsg 0335@xmath1052 , the br@xmath2 correction inferred from h@xmath2 and h@xmath2/h@xmath6 measurements is less than that determined from a direct br@xmath2 measurement ( in the case of ii zw 40 ) or from br@xmath7 ( for sbsg 0335@xmath1052 ) .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratio may underestimate the extinction in some cases ( see section 6 ) .",
    "most of the shifts seen in figure 5 are relatively small , @xmath100.1 magnitudes .",
    "however , for a few of our galaxies ( for example , he 2 - 10 ) , the shifts are sufficient to move the galaxies into the range expected from starlight . in these cases",
    ", br@xmath2 may be mainly responsible for the red [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors .    however , for some of our sample galaxies ( e.g. , ii zw 40 , sbsg 0335 - 052 , hs 0822 + 3542 , ngc 4194 , and shoc 391 ) , the br@xmath2-corrected colors are still redder than those expected by starlight alone . for ii",
    "zw 40 , this conclusion is particularly robust , because a direct br@xmath2 measurement is available @xcite . for sbsg 0335 - 052 ,",
    "the br@xmath7 observation of @xcite also provides a reasonably strong constraint .    in the right panel of figure 5 ,",
    "a similar plot is shown for the spiral sample .",
    "the open black circles are the published [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] values , while the red crosses show the values after correction for br@xmath2 , calculated using the total - galaxy h@xmath2 fluxes and the pa@xmath2/h@xmath2 ratio for the inner 50@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this plot shows that for normal spirals the corrections for br@xmath2 in the spitzer 4.5 @xmath0 m filter is generally very small , consistent with the fact that most of the published [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] values are in the expected range for starlight .",
    "another possible source of reddening of the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color is dust extinction of the starlight .",
    "the model [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of stars shown in figure 3 do not include reddening due to dust extinction . in modeling the spectral energy distributions in galaxies ,",
    "reddening is sometimes neglected at wavelengths @xmath5 3.6 @xmath0 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if the infrared sources are highly obscured , reddening by extinction may be important , even in the spitzer bands .",
    "how much reddening is present depends upon the properties of the dust grains , and therefore the extinction law , as well as the geometry of the system .",
    "the ratio of visual extinction to b @xmath1 v reddening a@xmath21/e(b @xmath1 v ) = r@xmath21 has been found to vary from @xmath43.1 in diffuse gas to @xmath45.5 in dense clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the extinction law in the spitzer bands also varies with optical depth @xcite .",
    "combining the extinction laws from these papers gives a range for a@xmath21/e(3.6 @xmath1 4.5 ) between @xmath4 41 for diffuse gas to @xmath468 for more extincted regions .",
    "the published h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratios for our sample dwarfs imply a@xmath21 between 0 and 2.5 , or reddening in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] of less than 0.06 magnitudes , not sufficient to account for the 4.5 @xmath0 m excess in our reddest systems .",
    "however , there is evidence that the h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratio strongly underestimates the extinction in at least some of our systems .",
    "the h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratio of sbsg 0335 - 052 , the galaxy in our sample with the reddest [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color , implies only a@xmath21 @xmath4 0.3 @xmath1 0.5 @xcite .",
    "however , mid - infrared spectroscopy of sbsg 0335 - 052 shows a deep 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature @xcite , suggesting a much higher optical depth of a@xmath21 @xmath4 15 @xmath1 20 .",
    "the br@xmath7/br@xmath2 ratio also suggests a much larger extinction than that implied by the h@xmath2/h@xmath6 ratio , a@xmath21 @xmath4 12 @xcite .",
    "dust modeling of the 6 @xmath1 100 @xmath0 m spectral energy distribution also suggests that most of the mid - infrared emission originates from a highly obscured ( a@xmath21 @xmath4 12@xmath130 ) luminous star cluster @xcite .",
    "the increase in derived extinction with wavelength implies a more complex geometry than a simple uniform foreground screen of dust , and suggests that the light seen in the optical is less obscured than the bulk of the starburst ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "thus caution should be taken in applying extinction corrections obtained from emission line ratios or silicate absorption features to stellar colors .",
    "furthermore , for different galaxies different datasets are available .    in the right panel of figure 6 , the blue open diamonds show the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of the normal spirals after correction for both br@xmath2 and for starlight reddening .",

    "we note that other techniques for obtaining extinctions such as background counts of galaxies through galaxian disks also give relatively small average obscurations for nearby spirals @xcite , consistent with the above range in a@xmath21 for spirals ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another source of near- to mid - infrared light in galaxies is nebular continuum emission , which we have neglected so far in our analysis . in the case of low metallicity starburst systems , this component can be important @xcite . to determine the contribution from the gaseous continuum to the spitzer bands",
    ", we ran another set of starburst99 models , including just starlight and the gaseous nebular continuum , excluding br@xmath2 and dust reddening . to calculate the gaseous continuum",

    "comparison with figure 3 shows that the addition of nebular continuum emission significantly reddens the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of young systems , particular for low metallicities .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath1010 myr 0.02 z@xmath14 instantaneous burst models with the nebular continuum included have [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors about 0.5 magnitudes redder than models without this component .",
    "for solar metallicities , ages @xmath104 myrs produce such red colors .",
    "thus the nebular continuum may be a very important component in very young and/or low metallicity systems .    in extreme cases ,",
    "the nebular continuum may dominate not only the 4.5 @xmath0 m band , but also the 3.6 @xmath0 m band .",
    "this is illustrated in figures 8 and 9 , where we plot the ratio of the nebular continuum flux in the 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands to the flux from starlight plus the nebular continuum , for the models shown in figure 7 .",
    "figures 8 and 9 show that , for solar metallicity and ages @xmath10 3 myrs , and for 0.02z@xmath14 and @xmath10 10 myrs , contributions to both bands from the nebular continuum are larger than from starlight .",
    "@xcite found that , for a 5 myr 0.02z@xmath14 burst , @xmath470@xmath19 of the flux in the l band is due to the nebular continuum , consistent with these plots .",
    "since the nebular contributions are typically larger at 4.5 @xmath0 m than 3.6 @xmath0 m , the net effect is a reddening of the observed colors of galaxies .",
    "the issue of non - stellar emissions at 3.6 @xmath0 m is discussed further in section 8 .    to determine the contribution from the nebular continuum for individual galaxies in our sample , we require an estimate of the average age of the stellar population .",
    "we do this two ways .",
    "first , we use starburst99 models and published h@xmath6 equivalent widths to estimate the age . for each galaxy , we use models with a metallicity closest to that of the published metallicity , and we fit both instantaneous and continuous star formation models .",
    "second , when sufficient broadband optical data is available ( @xmath53 filters ) , we fit the optical spectral energy distribution to starburst99 models to get the age and extinction of the contributing stars , and the uncertainties on these values ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we include the nebular continuum in the optical in doing these fits , and we conservatively assumed uncertainties in the optical colors of 0.1 magnitudes for all galaxies . in convolving the model spectra with the response functions of the broadband filters , we added the h@xmath2 emission line ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but did not include other emission lines .",
    "we used the @xcite extinction law .",
    "we did not use the near - infrared photometry in the fits , but used them after the fact to decide whether instantaneous or continuous star formation is more appropriate for the system . in most cases , both instantaneous and continuous models were consistent with the near - infrared data ; in a few galaxies , the continuous models produced too much near - infrared or 3.6 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "we then used the best - fit ages from the instantaneous burst models to determine the amount of reddening in the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color due to the nebular continuum .",
    "we then corrected the observed colors by this amount , adding to the corrections for br@xmath2 and dust extinction discussed above .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , some dwarf galaxies can be fit by continuous star formation models , while others are better explained by multiple bursts . for normal spirals , the broadband optical spectral energy distributions",
    "can generally be fit by continuous or exponentially decaying star formation @xcite .",
    "we choose to use instantaneous burst models to calculate the nebular contribution to the 4.5 @xmath0 m band since they produce less nebular emission for the same age , as shown in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "this thus provides a limiting case for the nebular continuum contribution . for some galaxies ,",
    "the fit to the optical data was quite poor , likely because their star formation history does not match either an instantaneous or continuous burst .",
    "these galaxies were excluded from figure 10 .    in figure 10 ,",
    "the nebular - corrected [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors are plotted against oxygen abundance , with the dwarfs in the left panel and the spirals in the right . in these plots ,",
    "the filled upside - down magenta triangles are the nebular continuum - corrected colors calculated using the best - fit ages from the h@xmath6 equivalent widths , while the cyan open diamonds are the nebular - corrected values using the best - fit ages from the broadband optical fitting . to illustrate the uncertainties in this correction , the open red circle shows the color after correction for nebular emission using the best fit age from the broadband fitting minus the 1@xmath24 uncertainty in the age . in some cases",
    ", the corrections to the spitzer [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color due to the nebular continuum is quite large , for example , it is @xmath40.4 magnitudes for sbsg 0335 - 052 .    in most cases , within the uncertainties the combined contributions of br@xmath2 , reddening due to dust extinction , and the nebular continuum can account for all of the observed reddening above starlight . in figure 10 , for all of the galaxies except two , the two estimates of the corrected color ( the magenta upside - down filled triangle and the cyan open diamond ) or the lower limit on the corrected color ( open red circle ) lie within the green hatched region , or span this region .",
    "for the two exceptions , the datasets are incomplete , thus we can not make firm conclusions . for haro 11 , as noted in section 6 , silicate absorption may be present in the spitzer spectrum @xcite , however , no optical depth has been published , and no published br@xmath2 or br@xmath7 values are available . for shoc 391 ,",
    "no br@xmath2 , br@xmath7 , or silicate absorption measurements are available .",
    "thus the extinction of the starlight and/or the correction for br@xmath2 in the spitzer 4.5 @xmath0 m band may be under - estimated for these galaxies .",
    "it is often assumed that the 3.6 @xmath0 m band is dominated by starlight , and a standard [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] spectrum is assumed for the stellar component , which is then subtracted from the observed 4.5 @xmath0 m flux to get the residual 4.5 @xmath0 m emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as noted above , nebular continuum emission may be important at both 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m ( see section 7 ) .",
    "also , if hot dust is significant at 4.5 @xmath0 m , it may also be present at 3.6 @xmath0 m , and even at 2 @xmath0 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to test whether significant non - stellar emission is present at 3.6 @xmath0 m in individual galaxies in our sample , we used our starburst99 fits to the broadband optical data .",
    "for all but one of the galaxies with available optical data , we can not rule out that all of the 3.6 @xmath0 m emission is due to starlight , since our best - fit stellar spectra are consistent with the observed spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m flux within the uncertainties .",
    "the only galaxy in our sample that shows a clear 3.6 @xmath0 m excess above the inferred stellar continuum is the reddest galaxy in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] , sbsg 0335 - 052 ( see figure 11 ; also see @xcite ) . for sbsg 0335 - 052 , although the inferred stellar continuum is consistent with the near - infrared photometry for both the instantaneous and continuous bursts , it is about a factor of 5 below the spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m measurement .",
    "however , when the nebular continuum is included in the spitzer bands , most of the 3.6 @xmath0 m flux can be accounted for ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "this shows that the 3.6 @xmath0 m excess may be mainly due to the gaseous continuum .",
    "we note that the best - fit extinction for the starburst99 model of sbsg 0335 - 052 , a@xmath21 = 1.0 @xmath25 0.5 , is significantly less than that inferred by the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature ( a@xmath21 @xmath4 15 @xmath1 20 ; @xcite ) . as mentioned in section 6",
    ", for this galaxy , the stars that dominate the observed light in the optical may be much less obscured than the stars that dominate in the infrared .",
    "thus our starburst99-derived extinction based on the optical data may not be an appropriate value to use in the infrared .",
    "a second more highly obscured stellar population , unseen in the optical , may also contribute to the observed spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m flux of this system .",
    "however , this second population is not evident in the near - infrared data .",
    "unfortunately , for some galaxies in our sample , no suitable broadband optical data were available for fitting , or we were not able to get good fits to the available data with our starburst99 models .",
    "thus we were not able to use this method to test for 3.6 @xmath0 m excesses above the stellar continuum in these galaxies .",
    "these galaxies include some of the reddest galaxies in our sample in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] : shoc 391 , haro 11 , pox 4 , and hs 0822 + 3542 .",
    "further observations and more detailed modeling of these systems are needed to search for 3.6 @xmath0 m excesses above the stellar continuum .",
    "none of the spirals in our sample for which a good fit to the optical data was found showed a 3.6 @xmath0 m excess above the inferred stellar continuum . as they also have [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors consistent with starlight ( figure 1 ) , this also implies little 4.5 @xmath0 m non - stellar excess in the spirals .",
    "as noted earlier , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah feature lies within the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer band , however , the spirals in our sample do not show unusually blue [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors .",
    "thus there is no strong evidence for a strong pah contribution to the 3.6 @xmath0 m flux of the spirals in our sample .",
    "as noted earlier , dwarf galaxies tend to have weaker pah features than spirals , thus this conclusion also may hold for the dwarf galaxies .",
    "an alternative way to search for 3.6 @xmath0 m excesses is to compare the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors with other near - to - mid - infrared colors ( figure 12 ) .",
    "the spirals ( right panel ) show less scatter in these colors than the dwarfs ( left panel ) , and the higher metallicity dwarfs ( blue open squares ) show less scatter than the lower metallicity dwarfs .",
    "for the dwarfs , weak correlations are seen between [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] and k @xmath1 [ 3.6 ] , and between [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] and h @xmath1 [ 3.6 ] , in that the extremely red galaxies in [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] also tend to be red in these other colors .",
    "this suggests that non - stellar contributions at 3.6 @xmath0 m may be present in these systems .",
    "the correlation seen between [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] and k @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] is not unexpected , if k roughly traces the older stellar population .",
    "no correlation is seen between [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] with h @xmath1 k.",
    "it is often assumed that excess emission at 4.5 @xmath0 m is due to hot dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , figure 10 shows that , for all the galaxies in our sample with sufficient data available , a combination of br@xmath2 , the nebular continuum , and dust reddening may be able to account for most of the 4.5 @xmath0 m excess .",
    "thus a major contribution from dust emission is not required . however , with the available data , given the uncertainties we are not able to completely rule out hot dust emission in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band .",
    "one way to distinguish between these different processes is with spectroscopy .",
    "however , at the present time , few high s / n spectra of galaxies in the 3 @xmath1 5 @xmath0 m range are available , since the spitzer spectrometers do not reach wavelengths @xmath10 4.9 @xmath0 m . co - added infrared space observatory ( iso ) 2.5 @xmath1 4.9 @xmath0 m spectra of disk galaxies show a continuum excess with a color temperature of @xmath41000k @xcite . at longer wavelengths , in the @xmath424 @xmath0 m range",
    ", the continuum emission from star forming galaxies is attributed to ` very small grains ' ( vsgs ; @xcite ) . in galactic hii regions ,",

    "since [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] is a measure of radiation field hardness , and metallicity is not expected to vary much within a dwarf galaxy , this indicates that pahs are destroyed in hard uv fields , while mid - infrared vsg excitation is enhanced .    in a few low metallicity galaxies with spatially - resolved iso spectra ,",
    "the short wavelength end ( 4.9 @xmath1 5.6 @xmath0 m ) shows strong continuum emission in regions with strong h@xmath2 emission @xcite .",
    "this supports the idea that the vsg continuum may extend well into the 3 @xmath1 5 @xmath0 m range . for sbsg 0335 - 052",
    ", a spitzer spectrum shows a 5 @xmath0 m continuum @xmath4 2 mjy @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of this to shorter wavelengths could possibly account for much of the observed 4.5 @xmath0 m broadband emission .",
    "three of our galaxies with very red [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors , sbsg 0335 - 052 , haro 11 , and shoc 391 , have been classified as ` mid - infrared peakers ' by @xcite , having infrared spectral energy distributions that peak near 24 @xmath0 m rather than in the far - infrared .",
    "this is consistent with these galaxies having very hot dust grains on average , and the dust continuum extending down to @xmath104.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "thus with the available data we can not rule out hot dust as a contributing factor .",
    "however , the above discussion shows that the nebular continuum can also be quite strong at these wavelengths , thus it is hard to separate these two components in the 3 @xmath1 5 @xmath0 m wavelength range .",
    "of the 71 galaxies in our dwarf sample , 18 are classified in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) as blue compact dwarfs or ` compact ' , 19 as irregular ( im / i0/irr / ibm / ib / iab ) , 3 as sm , and 3 as sd , with the rest listed as other types , such as hii galaxies or starbursts . in some cases ,",

    "the observation that the reddest galaxies tend to be classified as compact agrees with the hypothesis that more compact , and therefore more uv - intense and/or more obscured , star formation is occurring in these systems",
    ".    the reddest systems also show evidence for interactions or mergers : i zw 18 @xcite , sbsg 0335 - 052 @xcite , haro 11 @xcite , hs 0822 + 3542 @xcite , ngc 4194 @xcite , and ii zw 40 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that an interaction or merger has driven gas into the center of the system , causing very centrally - concentrated star formation .",
    "this may lead to very intense uv fields and/or high optical depths , causing hotter dust grains , more 24 @xmath0 m emission , more reddening due to extinction , more gaseous continuum emission , and/or more br@xmath2 .    in our earlier spitzer study of more massive interacting galaxies",

    "@xcite concluded that in most cases this continuum emission is due to single - photon heating , however , in the case of very intense uv radiation fields , a particle may not cool completely before absorbing another photon . in this case , higher temperatures are reached , and the peak of the vsg spectrum moves to shorter wavelengths . in sources with strong 4.5 @xmath0 m continuum , the particles may be larger and/or hotter , and possibly may be in thermal equilibrium with a hard intense uv field .",
    "it is unclear how the grains that produce the strong 6 @xmath1 30 @xmath0 m continuum in hii regions are related to the carriers of the @xmath42 @xmath1 3.7 @xmath0 m continuum found by @xcite in reflection nebulae , which was attributed to small grains ( @xmath410 ) stochastically heated to @xmath41000k by uv or optical photons @xcite .",
    "the ambient uv fields in these two environments are quite different .",
    "@xcite suggest that the near - infrared continuum - producing particles in reflection nebulae may be pahs that are larger , more ionized , and/or more dehydrogenated than those that produce the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah feature , or may require higher energies for excitation .",
    "interestingly , a 4.5 @xmath0 m excess has also been found for the diffuse galactic interstellar medium . @xcite",
    "found that the @xcite spitzer broadband measurements of diffuse milky way dust are consistent with standard dust models , except for the 4.5 @xmath0 m flux , which is too high by a factor of @xmath4 1.6 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite conclude that there is a ` near - infrared continuum ' which contributes at 4.5 @xmath0 m and 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "furthermore , @xcite compared their dust models to high galactic latitude emission as seen by dirbe , and found a 4.9 @xmath0 m excess ( @xmath42.5@xmath12 ) .",
    "they suggested an additional form of opacity at these wavelengths , for example , carbon chains ( e.g. , allamandola et al .  1999 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether the particles that produce this 4 @xmath1 5 @xmath0 m excess in the diffuse ism are the same as those that are responsible for the excess in dwarf galaxies .",
    "as noted by @xcite and @xcite , there appears to be a sharp change in the 8/24 @xmath0 m flux ratio of galaxies at log(o / h ) + 12 = 8.2 ( @xmath41/3 solar ) , in that this ratio abruptly decreases at this metallicity , perhaps because of weakening of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature at low metallicities .",
    "we see an abrupt change in the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color near this same metallicity , suggesting that the 4.5 @xmath0 m excess and the pah deficiency are related .",
    "one possibility is that at this metallicity threshold the uv field hardens sufficiently to more efficiently destroy pahs , and at the same time produces more br@xmath2 , more infrared nebular continuum , and/or more effectively excite the carriers of 4.5 @xmath0 m dust emission .",
    "a second possibility is that the destruction of the carriers of the pah emission features produces the particles that are responsible for a 4.5 @xmath0 m dust continuum .",
    "a third possibility is that there is an abrupt change in the chemistry of the interstellar matter at this metallicity , leading to both a deficiency in pahs and to a larger percentage of grains that are more effective at radiating in the 4.5 @xmath0 m regime .",
    "for example , the galaxian chemical evolution model of @xcite shows a time delay between the production of silicate dust grains in supernovae and the formation of carbon - rich material in asympotic giant branch stars , which can account for the relative deficiency of pahs at low metallicities .",
    "as noted earlier , the galaxies in our sample with extremely red [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors have infrared spectral energy distributions that peak near 24 @xmath0 m , while other low metallicity systems do not .",
    "@xcite suggest that the particles responsible for far - infrared / submillimeter emission are deficient in these galaxies , or are inefficiently heated .",
    "thus the composition of the interstellar dust in these galaxies may be different from other low metallicity systems .    for all of our galaxies with sufficient optical data except one , population synthesis modeling can not rule out that most of the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer flux is due to the stars seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "the exception , sbsg 0335 - 052 , either has a highly obscured stellar population unseen at optical and near - infrared wavelengths , or a strong nebular or hot dust continuum that contributes significantly at 3.6 @xmath0 m as well as at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "a similar situation applies for a star forming clump in the tidal tail of the interacting galaxy pair arp 285 .",
    "for this clump , population synthesis based on optical broadband data indicates an excess at both 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m flux above the inferred stellar continuum @xcite . as with sbsg 0335 - 052",
    ", this may be due to either a strong nebular continuum , hot dust being present at 3.6 @xmath0 m , or high obscuration in the optical .",
    "for a large sample of dwarf galaxies , we show that the spitzer broadband [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors depend upon metallicity , in that lower metallicity systems ( log(o / h ) @xmath1 12 @xmath11 8.2 ) show redder colors on average than higher metallicity systems , but with much scatter .",
    "comparison with stellar population synthesis models shows that starlight alone can not account for the range of observed colors , even when accounting for variations in age and metallicity .",
    "many galaxies have an excess at 4.5 @xmath0 m compared to that expected from stars . in some galaxies",
    ", br@xmath2 contributes significantly to the observed 4.5 @xmath0 m flux . in other systems ,",
    "the nebular continuum plays an important role in reddening the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color , and in extreme cases may dominate the observed flux at both 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the lower metallicities in dwarfs hardens the uv field , increasing the br@xmath2 luminosity and the gaseous continuum in the infrared . in addition",
    ", high obscuration can also redden the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] color in some cases .",
    "the combined effects of these three factors can account for the observed [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of all the galaxies in our sample that have sufficient data available .",
    "given the uncertainties , we can not rule out an additional component from hot dust at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "harder uv fields may increase the average dust temperature , increasing dust contributions at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , for our sample galaxies it does not appear to be the dominant factor .",
    "the galaxies with the largest 4.5 @xmath0 m excess are classified as blue compact dwarfs , and show evidence of recent interactions and mergers with other galaxies .",
    "such encounters may produce very concentrated star formation , causing very intense uv fields and/or high extinctions .",
    "for these galaxies , the 4.5 @xmath0 m luminosity may not be a good tracer of stellar mass .",
    "a similar analysis was done for a sample of nearby normal spirals .",
    "this showed that contributions from br@xmath2 and the nebular continuum to the 4.5 @xmath0 m fluxes of normal spirals are generally small , as is reddening of the [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] starlight by dust .",
    "this is consistent with their observed [ 3.6 ] @xmath1 [ 4.5 ] colors of @xmath4 0.0 . for normal spirals ,",
    "these bands appear to be dominated by starlight .",
