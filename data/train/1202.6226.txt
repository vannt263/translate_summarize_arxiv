    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a subclass of non - magnetic cataclysmic variables , which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a late - type companion star @xcite .",
    "the defining characteristic of dne is repeated optical outbursts , in which the optical brightness increases by 25  mag .",
    "thermal - viscous instability in the accretion disk is considered to be the cause ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the cycle repeats between two distinctive stable disk states : the quiescent state with the disk mostly made of neutral hydrogen and the outburst state mostly made of ionized hydrogen .",
    "the viscosity , surface density , and the mass accretion rate are higher in the latter state .",
    "dne are known to be x - ray emitters .",
    "the x - ray features typically show a dichotomy between the quiescent and outburst states . in the quiescent state , on one hand , the x - rays are from the hot and optically - thin thermal plasma , which is produced in the boundary layer between the inner edge of the accretion disk rotating at a keplerian velocity and the wd surface rotating at a slower spin period .",
    "the plasma is localized within a height of @xmath0@xmath1 from the surface of the wd with a radius of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is very hard with a temperature beyond 10  kev and strong fe  k emission features . in the outburst state , on the other hand",
    ", the hard emission is suppressed by a factor of a few and is replaced by extreme ultra - violet ( euv ) plasma emission with a much lower temperature .",
    "this is because the plasma in the boundary layer becomes optically thicker and more efficient in radiative cooling due to the increased accretion rate to the wd .",
    "one of the features often seen in the x - ray spectra of dne is a complex extinction structure in the soft band ( @xmath32  kev ) .",
    "the extinction can not be explained by interstellar absorption alone , which indicates the presence of circumstellar absorption . in eclipsing systems with high inclination angles ( e.g. , oy  car : @xcite and v893  sco : @xcite ) ,",
    "the complex extinction can be naturally interpreted as a partial absorption by a part of the accretion disk .",
    "however , the extra extinction is also seen in some non - eclipsing systems with lower inclination angles ( e.g. , ss  cyg : @xcite and z  cam : @xcite ) .",
    "one idea to explain such extinction is disk wind , which is ionized to some extent and intervenes partially or fully the line of sight .",
    "disk winds are a phenomenon seen in any types of compact objects with an accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they may play an important role in the feedback process of energy and matter from compact objects to the interstellar space and also to the intergalactic space in case of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in nearby dne , which are accessible with optical and ultra - violet ( uv ) spectroscopic observations ,",
    "disk wind is observed in many systems as p  cygni profiles @xcite , motivating the progress in spectral synthesis modeling of disk winds @xcite .",
    "if we can trace features of disk wind in x - ray spectra of dne , which is yet to be established , it will bring a wider application to constrain the wind parameters in a larger number of objects in a variety of phases in the quiescent and outburst cycles .",
    "of particular interest is the transition phase between the two states , in which we may be able to distinguish the extinction by disk wind from other causes , as we expect the disk wind to change its strength and structure during the transition .    in this paper",
    ", we present the result of a suzaku x - ray observation of z  cam , which was conducted by chance at the onset of an optical outburst . as we will discuss in ",
    "[ s5 - 2 ] , the source was in the x - ray quiescent phase , despite being in the outburst phase in the optical , suggesting that the heat wave had not reached the boundary layer .",
    "we utilize this opportunity to investigate the presence of circumstellar absorption in the x - ray spectrum and examine any changes in the feature .",
    "only a few x - ray observations were made to date in this particular phase of dn outbursts ( e.g. , z  cam : @xcite ; ss  cyg : @xcite ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in   [ s2 ] , we briefly summarize the basic properties of z  cam with an emphasis on disk winds . in ",
    "[ s3 ] and   [ s4 ] , we describe our observation and the result of temporal and spectral analysis , in which we present the presence of the circumstellar absorption and its time variation .",
    "we discuss some possible interpretations of our finding in   [ s5 ] , and conclude in   [ s6 ] .",
    "z  cam is the archetype of the z  cam subgroup of dne .",
    "it is one of the brightest dne in the optical band ( @xmath4=10.513.0  mag ) and thus is a well studied object .",
    "major parameters are summarized in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "sources in the z  cam subgroup show an optical outburst about every few months ( @xmath026  days on average for z  cam ; @xcite ) .",
    "the defining characteristic of this subgroup is the `` stand - still '' phase after some outbursts . for a certain period of time",
    ", the brightness stays in the middle of the outburst peak and the quiescence level , rather than decaying monotonically to the quiescence level .",
    "the stand - still phase continues for several days to even years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is ample evidence that z  cam has a mass loss in the form of wind .",
    "the object is thus used as a test bed for constructing uv spectral synthesis models of disk wind .",
    "the spatial structure of the wind is investigated by various authors @xcite , in which rotating biconical wind was found to explain various observed features very well .",
    "it is known that the disk wind appears and disappears depending on the phase of the outburst and quiescent cycle .",
    "the p  cygni profile of the c feature , which is the most prominent feature of the disk wind , was seen in the decline phase from an outburst , and one month from the start of a stand - still phase , but not in six months from the start of a stand - still and at quiescence @xcite . with a poor sampling only with uv observations , a picture of the temporal behavior of the wind ; i.e. , when the wind starts and stops emanating from the disk , is not yet clear .",
    "z  cam was observed in the x - ray band several times with the exosat @xcite , rosat @xcite , and asca @xcite observatories",
    ". a hint of x - ray absorption by wind was seen in two asca observations @xcite , in which extra absorption upon the interstellar absorption was required to explain the x - ray spectra .",
    "the amount of the extra absorption , which was successfully modelled by ionized absorber , was larger than the interstellar absorption by two orders of magnitude in both observations taken during an optical outburst and a transition phase from quiescence to the outburst .",

    "the narrow fov , the surrounding anti - coincidence detectors , and the low and stable instrumental background enable us to achieve unprecedented sensitivity in this energy band .    in our observation ,",
    "the target was placed at the center of the xis fov .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode with a frame time of 8  s.    the data were screened by the standard pipeline processing version  2.3 , in which we discarded events during south atlantic anomaly passages and earth elevation angles below 5  degrees . for the xis ,",
    "events were further removed during the elevation angles from the sun - lit earth below 20  degrees . for the pin , events taken at the cut - off - rigidity of less than 6  gv were removed . as a result",
    ", we obtained a net exposure time of 38  ks for the xis and 34  ks for the pin . throughout this paper , we used the heasoft version  6.8 for data reduction and the ` xspec ` package version  12.7 @xcite for spectral fitting .",
    "in the xis image , we see no source besides z  cam .",
    "we accumulated the source events from a circular region of @xmath26 ( 180  pixels ) in radius , which maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the background events were extracted from an annulus of 4@xmath257@xmath25 radii concentric to the source region .",
    "the encircled energy fraction of the background region is approximately 3% of the source region .    for the pin , which is a non - imaging detector , the background consists of the instrumental non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and possible contaminating sources within the fov .",

    "( 140mm,80mm)f2.eps    using the xis ( 0.212  kev ) and pin ( 1440  kev ) data , we constructed light curves of the background - subtracted count rate ( figure  [ f2 ] ) .",

    "no similar change is seen in the pin light curve ( figure  [ f2]d ) . for time - sliced spectroscopy in later sections (   [ s4 - 4 ] ) , we divided the observation time into three phases ; phase  2 being the interval with a significant decrease in the hardness ratio and the phases  1 and 3 being the intervals prior and posterior to the phase  2 , respectively ( figure  [ f2 ] ) .",

    ", we used the standard detector response file distributed by the instrument team .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows the 0.3540  kev spectrum using both the xis and the pin . the most prominent feature in the entire spectrum is the intense emission lines at 6.7 and 7.0  kev respectively from the @xmath32 lines by fe and the ly@xmath33 line by fe , which indicates an optically - thin thermal plasma .",
    "other features can also be noticed .    in order to characterize the spectrum",
    ", we began with a simple model ; i.e. , multi - temperature thin - thermal plasma model ( ` cemekl ` ) attenuated by photoelectric absorption ( ` tbabs ` : @xcite ) of a column fixed to the interstellar value ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the multi - temperature model is an integral of a single - temperature plasma model ( ` mekal ` : @xcite ) with a differential emission measure ( @xmath34 ) as a function of the plasma temperature ( @xmath35 ) in a power - law form of @xmath36 .",
    "such a model is widely used to describe x - ray spectra from cvs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we call this model a `` fiducial model '' .",
    "the residuals to the fiducial model ( figure  [ f4 ] ) indicate that the spectral model requires other components to account for the following : ( 1 )  excess emission line at 6.4  kev presumably from fe k@xmath33 fluorescent emission , ( 2 )  extra attenuation below @xmath02  kev , which is attributable to extinction by circumstellar medium ( csm ) , and ( 3 )  excess emission above @xmath020  kev , which is a signature of compton - scattered continuum emission . in the given spectrum",
    ", we found that these multiple spectral components are coupled with each other .",
    "therefore , we started by inspecting each component separately by local fitting in carefully selected energy bands (   [ s4 - 3 - 1]  [ s4 - 3 - 3 ] ) and then conducted the entire fitting with a synthesized model (   [ s4 - 3 - 4 ] ) .",

    "the inclination angle was fixed to the value in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "we fitted the 440  kev spectrum using the fiducial model plus a gaussian line component , which is modified by the compton reflection model ( ` reflect ` : @xcite ) .",

    "the residual ( figure  [ f6]b ) indicates that the observed spectrum remains less attenuated than the model predicts despite the fact that the deviation from the fiducial model ( figures  [ f4 ] and [ f6]a ) starts at an energy as high as @xmath03  kev .",
    "this is a signature of either or both of the partial coverage by the absorber or the absorber being ionized .",
    "we thus employed a partial absorption by neutral matter ( ` pcfabs ` ) , a full absorption by ionized matter ( ` zxipcf ` with the covering fraction fixed to 1 ) , or a partial absorption by ionized matter ( ` zxipcf ` , in which the covering fraction is a free parameter ) .",

    "however , the x - ray characteristics are those typical of the quiescent phase in the following three points .    first , in the suzaku observation , the observed emission was quite hard with a 210  kev luminosity at 163  pc ( table  [ t1 ] ) of @xmath132  erg  s@xmath22 .",
    "the luminosity is quite similar to the exosat measurement made at quiescence @xcite and is larger by 32 times than the asca measurement made at an optical and presumably x - ray outburst phase @xcite . here",
    ", we used the ` pimms ` tool for the flux conversion . in the dichotomy of enhanced and suppressed hard x - ray emission in the quiescent and outburst phases , respectively , the observed hardness and luminosity indicate that the suzaku observation was made during the x - ray quiescent phase .",
    "second , with the observed x - ray data , we can estimate the accretion rate from the inner part of the disk to the wd surface ( @xmath133 ) . assuming that an in - falling particle releases an energy of @xmath134 , in which @xmath59 is the maximum plasma temperature of the boundary layer , the bolometric luminosity of the boundary layer is described as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the mean molecular weight ( typically @xmath00.6 ) and @xmath137 is the mass of hydrogen @xcite . by substituting @xmath138 and @xmath59 with the observed values",
    ", we found that @xmath139  @xmath16  yr@xmath22 , which is comparable to the typical value during the quiescence of dne @xcite , but is much smaller than the value required for triggering outbursts ( @xmath0@xmath140  @xmath16  yr@xmath22 : @xcite ) .",
    "third , we derived a constraint of the reflection geometry from the spectral fitting using the hard x - ray emission above 20  kev and the fe  k fluorescent line @xcite . assuming that the wd surface contributes most as the reflector to reprocess the x - rays from the plasma , the solid angle subtended by the reflector ( @xmath40 ) converts to the scale height ( @xmath141 ) of the x - ray plasma from the wd surface ( figure  [ f5 ] ) .",
    "using the observed value @xmath45 ( tables  [ t2 ] and [ t3 ] ) , @xmath142  cm ( table  [ t1 ] ) , which is in line with the boundary layer being the source of the x - ray emission as in other dne in the quiescent phase @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that our observation was made between the start of the state change in the outer part of the disk and the arrival of the heat wave to the inner part of the disk , in which optical outburst and x - ray quiescence co - exist .",
    "such a transition phase is expected to last for @xmath01  day , which is the time for the heating front to traverse the disk @xcite .",
    "in fact , some x - ray observations were made in such a transition phase of dne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including one of the two asca observations of z cam @xcite .",
    "the entire suzaku observation was within this transition phase as we see no signs of spectral change except for the change in the circumstellar absorption (   [ s4 - 3 - 3 ] and   [ s4 - 4 ] ) , but the last part of the asca observation was in the optical outburst phase as the x - ray luminosity declined in the last part of the observation with no change of spectral hardness .",
    "it suggests that the phase for an outburst of our suzaku observation was preceded that of the asca observation .",
    "we speculate the cause for the circumstellar absorption and its time variation .",
    "two possible agents for the absorption are ( i )  disk wind and ( ii )  geometrically flaring disk .",
    "both models can explain the observed extinction feature modeled by a partially - covering neutral or ionized absorption .",
    "in the wind model , the ionized partial absorption is expected to intervene in the line of sight with the covering fraction possibly representing the degree of porousness of the wind . in the flaring disk model , a part of the swollen disk",
    "is expected to cause a partial coverage either by neutral or ionized matter .",
    "the two models can not be distinguished from our spectral results alone .",
    "however , we also found a time - variation of the circumstellar absorption , which is not associated with the orbital period .",
    "we would naturally expect the variation associated with the orbital period in the flaring disk interpretation , thus we favor the disk wind interpretation for the cause of the circumstellar absorption .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows a schematic view , in which the disk wind is triggered by the propagation of the heat wave and causes a partial covering in the line of sight x - rays from the plasma localized in the boundary layer .",
    "what is perplexing is that the time variation of the circumstellar absorption is not a monotonic increase and eventual saturation of the absorption column , which would be navely expected in the disk wind interpretation .",
    "the variation that we saw might be due to the change in the degree of porousness of the relatively stable wind , rather than the change in strength of the wind . a longer coverage of an outburst phase as well as the coverage of other phases far from the outburst and transition phases with the same data quality will help us to test our ideas .",
    "the mechanism to launch disk wind is not well understood yet .",
    "if the absorption seen in our observation is caused by the wind , we argue that x - ray radiation pressure does not play an important role at least in the x - ray quiescent phase .",
    "first , the increase of the additional absorption in phase  2 does not accompany any changes in the intrinsic x - ray emission properties .",
    "second , the x - ray radiation energy absorbed by the additional absorber can be derived as a difference between the additional - absorption corrected and uncorrected luminosity in the 0.3510  kev band .",
    "the value @xmath0@xmath143  erg  s@xmath22 is smaller than the wind mechanical energy of @xmath0@xmath144  erg  s@xmath22 by more than an order with a mass loss rate of @xmath145@xmath146  yr@xmath22 @xcite and a mean wind velocity of 1000  km  s@xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we conducted a suzaku x - ray observation of the dwarf nova z  cam at the onset of an optical outburst by chance .",
    "the x - ray spectral characteristics , however , suggest that the source was in the x - ray quiescent phase .",
    "this implies that our observation was made at the time when the heat wave had not reached to the inner part of the accretion disk in the development of the outburst , during which optical outburst and x - ray quiescent phases co - exist .",
    "the x - ray spectrum shows clear evidence of an extra absorption upon the interstellar absorption , as was presented in the previous work .",
    "we found that ( i )  the extra absorption was modeled successfully by partial coverage either by neutral or ionized matter , ( ii )  the absorption shows a time variation with a time scale of @xmath020  ks , ( iii )  the variation is mostly attributable to the change in the covering fraction , and ( iv )  the variation is not associated with the orbital period of the system . from these finding , we argued that the circumstellar absorption can be either by disk wind or geometrically flaring disk that intervene in the line of sight of the x - rays located in the boundary layer between the wd surface and the disk .",
