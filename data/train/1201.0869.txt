    "despite the large volume of experimental and theoretical work on condensed phases of water , some of their properties still lack a complete understanding .",
    "this is mainly due to the peculiar structure of liquid and solid water , where hydrogen bonds between contiguous molecules give rise to properties somewhat different than those of most known liquids and solids ( the so - called water `` anomalies'').@xcite    in the temperature region between 80 k and 250 k , ice ih is the stable phase of water up to a pressure around 0.2 gpa ( that increases for increasing temperature ) .",
    "this range may seem rather narrow for some purposes , especially if one compares it with other types of materials different from molecular solids . however , this pressure region is large if one takes into account the nature of the intermolecular interaction in water , which gives rise to the presence of hydrogen bonds .",
    "the region of mechanical stability of ice ih , in which this phase is metastable has been studied both experimentally and by computer simulations . at 80 k , simulations@xcite have predicted it to be metastable down to a negative pressure ( tension ) of about 1.4 gpa , whereas for positive pressure ( compression ) its range of metastability is known to extend up to around 1 gpa , where ice ih transforms into an amorphous phase ( the so - called high - density amorphous ice).@xcite this pressure - induced amorphization of ice ih is an issue that has received in recent years a considerable amount of attention , along with the existence of different amorphous phases which clearly differ in density.@xcite    computer simulation of condensed phases of water at an atomic level has a long history , dating back to around 1970.@xcite since then , important efforts have been focused on the development and refinement of empirical potentials to describe both liquid and solid phases of water , so that nowadays a large variety of this kind of potentials can be found in the literature.@xcite .",
    "many of them assume a rigid geometry for the water molecule , and some others include molecular flexibility either with harmonic or anharmonic oh stretches .",
    "in recent years , moreover , simulations of water using _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) have been carried out.@xcite nevertheless , it turns out that the hydrogen bonds in condensed phases of water are difficult to describe with presently available energy functionals , which causes that some properties can not be accurately reproduced by dft calculations.@xcite some promising advances to improve the description of van der waals interactions in water within the dft formalism have been recently presented.@xcite    a limitation of _ ab - initio _ electronic - structure calculations is that they usually treat atomic nuclei as classical particles , not including quantum effects like zero - point motion .",
    "these effects can be taken into account by using harmonic or quasiharmonic approximations for the nuclear motion , but the precision of these approaches is not easily estimated when large anharmonicities are present , as can be the case for light atoms like hydrogen . to take into account the quantum character of atomic nuclei , the path - integral molecular dynamics ( or monte carlo ) approach has proved to be very useful , since in this procedure the nuclear degrees of freedom can be quantized in an efficient manner , thus including both quantum and thermal fluctuations in many - body systems at finite temperatures.@xcite thus , a powerful method can consist in combining dft to determine the electronic structure and path integrals to describe the quantum motion of atomic nuclei.@xcite however , this procedure requires computer resources that would restrict enormously the number of state points that can be considered in actual calculations .",
    "the phase diagram of water is now known up to temperatures and pressures on the order of 1000 k and hundreds of gpa , respectively .",
    "present - day interatomic potentials are able to predict rather accurately the range of stability corresponding to the different known phases.@xcite it is however important to estimate the influence of quantum nuclear effects on the stability range of the different ice phases . in this line",
    ", it is known that such quantum effects change the melting temperature @xmath1 of ice ih at ambient pressure by some degrees , as manifested by the isotope effect on @xmath1.@xcite this kind of quantum effects has been less studied for liquid and solid water under external pressure . in particular ,",
    "the spinodal line for ice ih at negative pressures ( which defines the limit of mechanical stability of this water phase ) has been calculated by using classical molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite earlier studies of ice ih using path - integral simulations have been carried out by using mainly effective potentials , and were focused on structural and dynamic properties of the solid phase.@xcite    quantum nuclear effects become more relevant for light atomic masses , and are expected to be especially important in the case of hydrogen .",
    "then , we pose the question of how quantum effects associated to the lightest atom can influence the structural properties of a solid water phase such as ice ih , and in particular if these effects are relevant or detectable for the solid at different densities , i.e. under different external pressures .",
    "this refers to the crystal volume and interatomic distances , but also to the mechanical stability of the solid . in this context",
    ", it is usually assumed that increasing quantum fluctuations monotonically enhances the exploration of the energy landscape .",
    "however , in certain regimes an increase in quantum fluctuations can lead to dynamical arrest , as shown for glass formation.@xcite a similar mechanism could also retard the transition from crystalline to disordered ( amorphous ) phases .    in the present paper we study ice ih by path - integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) simulations at different pressures and temperatures , to assess the range of mechanical stability of this water phase , as well as to analyze its structural properties .",
    "interatomic interactions are described by the flexible q - tip4p / f model , which has been recently developed and was employed to carry out pimd simulations of liquid water@xcite and ice ih at ambient pressure.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we describe the computational method and the model employed in our calculations . our results are presented in sec.iii , dealing with the pressure dependence of crystal volume , bulk modulus , interatomic distances , atomic delocalization , and kinetic energy of ice ih .",
    "sec.iv includes a summary of the main results .",
    "we employ here the pimd method to obtain equilibrium properties of ice ih at different temperatures and pressures .",
    "this method is based on an isomorphism between the actual quantum system and a classical one , that appears after a discretization of the quantum density matrix along cyclic paths.@xcite this isomorphism is in fact obtained by replacing each quantum particle by a ring polymer consisting of @xmath2 ( trotter number ) classical particles , connected by harmonic springs with temperature- and mass - dependent force constant .",
    "details on this simulation technique can be found elsewhere.@xcite we note that the dynamics employed in this method is fictitious and does not correspond to the actual quantum dynamics of the real particles under consideration , but it is used to effectively sample the many - body configuration space , giving precise results for the equilibrium properties of the quantum system .",
    "an alternative way to derive equilibrium properties is the use of monte carlo sampling , but this procedure has been found to require for the present problem more computer resources than the pimd method .",
    "a particular advantage of the latter is that in this case the codes can be more readily parallelized , an important factor for efficient use of modern computer architectures .",
    "simulations of ice ih have been carried out here in the isothermal - isobaric @xmath3 ensemble ( @xmath4 , number of particles ; @xmath5 , pressure ; @xmath6 , temperature ) , which allows us to obtain the equilibrium volume of the solid at given pressure and temperature .",
    "we have employed effective algorithms for performing pimd simulations in this statistical ensemble , as those described in the literature.@xcite sampling of the configuration space has been carried out at temperatures between 50 k and 300 k , and pressures in the region of mechanical stability of ice ih ( which at 50 k corresponds to the range from 1.4 to 1.1 gpa ) .",
    "note that we have employed both negative ( tension ) and positive ( compression ) pressures in the simulations .",
    "for comparison with results of pimd simulations , some simulations of ice ih were also carried out in the classical limit , which is obtained in our path integral procedure by setting the trotter number @xmath2 = 1 .",
    "our simulations were carried out on ice ih supercells with periodic boundary conditions . to check the influence of finite - size effects on the results",
    ", we considered orthorhombic supercells of two different sizes .",
    "the smaller one included 96 water molecules and had parameters @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the standard hexagonal lattice parameters of ice ih , whereas the larger supercell included 288 molecules and had parameters @xmath10 .",
    "results obtained for both types of supercells coincided within the error bars due to the statistical uncertainty associated to the simulation method .",
    "the flexibility of the simulation cell was taken into account in the @xmath3 simulations by treating the modules of the orthorhombic cell vectors as independent dynamic variables . in the considered supercells , and before the pimd simulations , proton - disordered ice structures were generated by a monte carlo procedure , in such a way that each oxygen atom had two chemically bonded and two h - bonded hydrogen atoms , and with a cell dipole moment close to zero.@xcite    the interatomic interactions have been modeled by the point charge , flexible q - tip4p / f model , recently developed to study liquid water,@xcite and that was subsequently employed to study several properties of ice,@xcite as well as water clusters.@xcite in line with the arguments discussed by habershon _",
    "et  al._,@xcite there are some reasons to take this model potential for the present study .",
    "first , most previous works that have considered quantum effects in water phases have employed empirical potential models that were parameterized on the basis of earlier classical simulations .",
    "then , quantum simulations using those models lead to `` double counting '' of quantum effects .",
    "second , many of the empirical potentials previously used for quantum simulations of condensed phases of water treat h@xmath11o molecules as rigid bodies.@xcite this can be convenient for computational efficiency , but it disregards the important role of intramolecular flexibility in the structure , dynamics , and thermodynamics of the condensed water phases.@xcite third , the significant anharmonicity of the o ",
    "h vibration of the water molecule is taken into account by anharmonic stretches in the q - tip4p / f potential , vs. the harmonic potentials employed in the majority of simulations that considered quantum effects .",
    "technical details on the simulations presented here are the same as those employed and described in refs .  .",
    "in particular , the trotter number @xmath2 was taken proportional to the inverse temperature ( @xmath12 ) , so that @xmath13 = 6000  k , which allows one to keep roughly a constant precision in the pimd results at different temperatures .",
    "also , the time step @xmath14 associated to the calculation of interatomic forces was taken in the range between 0.1 and 0.3 fs , which was found to provide adequate convergence for the variables studied here .",
    "for given temperature and pressure , a typical simulation run consisted of @xmath15 pimd steps for system equilibration , followed by @xmath16 steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties . at ambient pressure , the interatomic potential q - tip4p / f predicts melting of ice ih at 251 k,@xcite but here we study this water phase up to 300 k , a temperature at which it was found to be metastable along our simulations .    from pimd simulations one can obtain insight into the atomic delocalization at finite temperatures .",
    "this includes a thermal ( classical ) delocalization , as well as a delocalization associated to the quantum character of the atomic nuclei , which is quantified by the extension of the quantum paths in the path integral formalism .",
    "for each quantum path of a given particle , one can define the center - of - gravity ( centroid ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the position of bead @xmath19 in the associated ring polymer .",
    "then , the mean - square displacement @xmath20 of the atomic nuclei ( h or o ) along a pimd simulation run is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 indicates a thermal average at a given temperature . in connection with the quantum delocalization of a particle , in this formalism",
    "it is interesting the spread of the paths associated to the particle , which can be measured by the mean - square `` radius - of - gyration '' @xmath23 of the ring polymers : @xmath24",
    "we first present results for the equilibrium volume of ice ih , as derived from our pimd simulations at given pressure and temperature , in the pressure region where the solid turned out to be mechanically stable .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .  1 , where we show the pressure dependence of the molar volume at three different temperatures : 50 , 100 , and 251 k.",
    "there are several important observations to make with regard to this figure . at a given temperature , we observe the usual volume decrease for rising pressure , i.e. , @xmath25 . in most of the pressure region",
    "considered , the slope @xmath26 becomes less negative as the pressure is raised , which means @xmath27 .",
    "however , at about @xmath5 = 0.5 gpa we observe a change in the trend of the first derivative as indicated by the presence of an inflection point with @xmath28 . at higher pressures ,",
    "the slope increases in absolute value until reaching the limit of mechanical stability of the solid , close to @xmath5 = 1  gpa .",
    "this change in the trend of the @xmath29 curve , with the appearance of an inflection point seems to be related to the proximity of the amorphization of the solid , with an important reduction in the molar volume.@xcite in fact , this amorphization is associated with a divergence in the compressibility of ice ih , where the derivative @xmath30 should diverge to @xmath31 ( see below ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that the volume - pressure curves cross at @xmath32 0.20.3  gpa . at negative pressures we find that the larger volumes correspond to the higher temperatures , as expected for the usual thermal expansion of solids .",
    "however , at @xmath33 one finds just the opposite trend : the higher volume corresponds to the lower temperature , a fact associated to the negative thermal expansion occurring for ice ih at low @xmath6 .",
    "the potential tip4p / f is able to reproduce this negative thermal expansion at atmospheric pressure , as discussed elsewhere.@xcite at @xmath5 = 1 atm ( @xmath34 gpa ) , the line corresponding to 251 k in fig .",
    "1 is still above those found for lower temperatures , but lies below them at higher ( but relatively low ) positive pressures .",
    "this anomalous behavior of the crystal volume as a function of temperature is due to the negative sign of the grneisen parameter for ta vibrational modes.@xcite for a mode in the @xmath35th phonon branch with wave vector @xmath36 , this parameter @xmath37 is defined from the logarithmic derivative of its frequency with respect to the crystal volume:@xcite @xmath38 negative values of @xmath37 for ta modes in ice have been related to the tetrahedral coordination of water molecules , and a negative thermal expansion has been also observed in other solids with similar structures . in particular , it is well known for crystals with diamond and zinc blende structure.@xcite in connection with this , negative values of @xmath37 for ta modes were also found to be related with the pressure - induced amorphization of ice ih.@xcite in fact , they cause that the relations between elastic constants necessary for crystal stability are violated at a certain applied pressure , giving rise to mechanical instability of the solid . in this line , instabilities in transverse acoustical modes in ice ih were also found at low temperatures from incoherent inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite    for @xmath39 , the absolute value of the slope @xmath26 increases fast , and eventually diverges for a finite value of the pressure , which depends on temperature .",
    "this is associated with a divergence of the compressibility of the solid , which gives the limit for the mechanical stability of this ice phase ( spinodal point ) at negative pressures . on the other side , for positive pressures the stability limit at @xmath32 1  gpa",
    "is related to the amorphization of the solid .",
    "in fact , at these pressures we find in the pimd simulations a sudden reduction in the volume of the solid , accompanied by the breaking and reordering of hydrogen bonds ( see below ) .",
    "note that the possibility of studying a solid phase in metastable conditions , close to a spinodal line is limited by the appearance of nucleation events , which cause the breakdown of the crystal structure and the surge of the equilibrium phase . in this kind of atomistic simulations",
    "the probability of such nucleation events at low temperatures is relatively low , and the metastable range of the solid that can be explored is rather large .",
    "in fact , one can go to conditions close to the spinodal lines at positive and negative pressures , especially at @xmath0 .    at 250 k ice ih",
    "was found to be stable along our simulations up to @xmath5 = 0.9  gpa . at such pressures , the h - bond network of ice ih collapses and the crystal transforms into the amorphous phase with an important volume decrease . at @xmath6 = 251 k and @xmath5 = 1  gpa ,",
    "this decrease amounts to about 18% of the crystal volume .",
    "something similar happens at lower temperatures , and at 100 k we found a volume reduction of 24% in the amorphization process .",
    "this is in line with the pressure - induced amorphization of ice ih first observed at @xmath6 = 77 k , and occurring at about @xmath5 = 1  gpa.@xcite this water phase is the so - called high - density amorphous ice.@xcite note that at higher @xmath6 ( in the order of 250 k ) amorphization of ice ih has not been experimentally observed , and a transition to ice iii at @xmath32 0.2 gpa could be expected .",
    "such transitions between crystalline ice phases are usually not observed from the kind of atomistic simulations employed here , and other types of simulations employing thermodynamic integration would be required for this purpose.@xcite the important point here is that we obtain at each temperature the pressure range in which ice ih is metastable with the employed potential model , i.e. , we are not discussing the transitions between equilibrium ( crystalline ) phases , as they would appear in the phase diagram of water .",
    "our results are in line with those derived from classical molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite in particular , sciortino _",
    "et al._@xcite employed the tip4p potential , and found that the solid suffers reversible changes at 77 k for compression ( @xmath33 ) up to @xmath40 1.5 gpa . at higher pressures ,",
    "ice was found to become amorphous in an irreversible way , i.e. it remained in the amorphous phase when decreasing the pressure to low values in the order of 1 atm .",
    "the molar volume of ice ih has been determined experimentally in different ways , e.g. , x - ray , optical , mechanical , calorimetric , acoustical , or nuclear methods ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "measurements of different authors typically deviate from each other by up to about 0.3%.@xcite our results at atmospheric pressure are in line with those of refs .  ,",
    "considered in ref .   the most accurate determinations at normal pressure and @xmath6 = 273  k. these data are represented in fig .  1 by a solid diamond .      the compressibility of liquid water and ice shows peculiar properties associated to the hydrogen - bond network present in these condensed phases",
    "it turns out that their compressibility is smaller than what one could expect at first sight from the large cavities present in their structure , which could probably collapse under pressure without water molecules approaching close enough to repel each other .",
    "however , this is not the case , and for ice ih in particular the hydrogen bonds holding the crystal structure are known to be rather stable , as revealed by the relatively high pressure necessary to break down the h - bond network.@xcite    the isothermal compressibility @xmath41 of ice , or its inverse the bulk modulus [ @xmath42 can be straightforwardly obtained from our pimd simulations in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble . in this ensemble",
    "the isothermal bulk modulus can be calculated from the mean - square fluctuations of the volume , @xmath43 , by employing the expression@xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 being boltzmann s constant .",
    "this expression was used earlier to obtain the bulk modulus of different types of solids from path - integral simulations.@xcite    at atmospheric pressure we have found results for the bulk modulus of ice ih similar to those derived from experiments . in particular , at @xmath6 = 251 and 300 k , we found @xmath46 = 9.1  gpa and 8.4  gpa , respectively .",
    "there appears in the literature a dispersion of data for the isothermal compressibility ( or bulk modulus ) of ice ih at the melting temperature and normal pressure .",
    "the values of @xmath46 obtained here are in line with @xmath46 = 8.49  gpa at @xmath6 = 273 k , corresponding to the equation of state derived by feister and wagner@xcite for this water phase from a set of experimental data .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the precision of this value of the bulk modulus due to the lack of error bars for the published data , and the uncertainty may be large , as suggested by the dispersion in experimental data obtained by different authors ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the uncertainty is even larger at lower temperatures , where we could not find any direct experimental data for the isothermal compressibility .",
    "the bulk modulus calculated from our pimd simulations decreases for rising temperature ( a fact commonly found in solids ) , and this behavior appears to be true for all studied pressures , except for @xmath47 1 gpa , where this general trend seems to be inverted ( see below ) .",
    "we will first discuss our results for negative pressure ( solid under tension ) .",
    "for @xmath0 , the bulk modulus decreases as the pressure becomes more negative ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which means @xmath48 at all temperatures under consideration . then",
    ", @xmath46 is expected to vanish at a temperature - dependent pressure @xmath49 , which corresponds to the spinodal point defining the limit of mechanical stability of ice ih at negative pressures ( where the compressibility diverges to infinity ) .    at a given temperature and near the spinodal pressure",
    ", our results for the bulk modulus can be fitted to the expression @xmath50 , which allows us to obtain @xmath49 from a linear fit of @xmath51 vs @xmath5 .",
    "this pressure dependence of @xmath46 can be understood in the following way.@xcite at a temperature @xmath6 , and calling @xmath52 the free energy , the spinodal point is given by the condition @xmath53 , which can be rewritten as @xmath54 .",
    "thus , close to @xmath49 one can write along an isotherm : @xmath55 with constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 independent of @xmath58 . assuming @xmath59 ( which seems to be true here )",
    ", one has @xmath60 for small values of the difference @xmath61 ( for discussions on the case @xmath62 , see ref .  ) .",
    "such a pressure dependence for @xmath46 , or its equivalent : @xmath63 has been obtained earlier for ice and sio@xmath11 cristobalite , as well as for rare - gas solids close to their stability limits.@xcite this means in our case that the exponents describing the singularity are consistent with those of the mean - field spinodal,@xcite given by eq .",
    "( [ pres2 ] ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath64 are the values of the pressure and volume on the spinodal .",
    "thus , we have obtained @xmath49 at each temperature by fitting our results for the bulk modulus at @xmath0 to an expression @xmath50 .",
    "the results for @xmath49 , as derived from our pimd simulations , are shown in fig .  3 by solid circles .",
    "@xmath49 becomes less negative as the temperature is raised , going from 1.38 gpa at 50 k to 0.73 gpa at 300 k.    we now turn to the results at positive pressures ( compression ) . for @xmath65 0 ,",
    "the bulk modulus increases moderately until reaching a maximum value at about 0.30.5 gpa .",
    "this maximum value of @xmath46 is lower for higher @xmath6 , as shown in fig .  2 , and appears to be slightly shifted to lower pressures as temperature increases .",
    "et al._@xcite measured the equation of state of ice ih at 145 k under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.5 gpa , and fitted their results for the pressure dependence of the volume to a murnaghan equation .",
    "they obtained at zero pressure a bulk modulus @xmath46 = 9.85(47 ) gpa , somewhat lower than that derived from our simulations at 150 k : @xmath46 = 11.9  gpa .    at pressures larger than 0.5 gpa",
    "the bulk modulus derived from our pimd simulations decreases rather fast , until reaching at each temperature a certain pressure at which @xmath46 approaches zero and ice ih becomes mechanically unstable .",
    "we will call @xmath66 this spinodal pressure .",
    "close to @xmath66 one has a relation between @xmath46 and @xmath5 similar to that given above , but valid here for @xmath67 , so that : @xmath68 .",
    "fitting our results to this expression we find that the bulk modulus extrapolates to zero for @xmath49 = 1.11 and 1.25 gpa , at 50 and 100 k , respectively . at higher temperatures ,",
    "this extrapolation can not be done from our pimd results in a reliable way , since the solid collapses into the amorphous phase at pressures clearly lower than that corresponding to the metastability limit of the crystal , where the bulk modulus is still far from vanishing .",
    "this is due to a kinetic phenomenon such as the nucleation of a new phase , which prevents close approach to the spinodal , as indicated above .",
    "thus , at 250 k ice ih was metastable in our pimd simulations only up to @xmath5 = 0.9 gpa , where the bulk modulus is still larger than 7 gpa , but the ice crystal transforms into the amorphous phase with an appreciable volume decrease .",
    "arguments equivalent to those presented here for the ice instability associated to a vanishing bulk modulus , have been given in connection with the elastic moduli of this hexagonal crystal.@xcite    in fig .",
    "3 we present values of the spinodal pressure @xmath66 , as derived from our pimd simulations , along with those corresponding to negative pressures , @xmath49 ( represented as solid circles ) . in both cases the spinodal pressure increases as the temperature is raised . at positive pressure , we show only results up to 100 k , as at higher @xmath6 the extrapolation employed to determine @xmath66 is unreliable , as explained above .",
    "these results are compared with those derived from classical molecular dynamics simulations ( open squares ) . at positive pressure",
    ", @xmath66 derived from classical simulations is larger than that found from pimd , and the opposite occurs for the spinodal @xmath49 at negative pressures . in both cases , quantum and classical results are found to lie closer as temperature is raised .",
    "altogether we find that quantum effects reduce the metastability range of ice ih .",
    "this means that at low temperature the pressure region in which this water phase is metastable is reduced by about 0.3 gpa , both at negative and positive pressures . for comparison with the calculated spinodal",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "3 the value of @xmath5 = 1 gpa given by mishima _",
    "et al._@xcite for the laboratory amorphization pressure at 77 k ( solid diamond ) .",
    "spinodal pressures for ice ih have been calculated earlier by sciortino _",
    "et al._@xcite from classical molecular dynamics simulations with the tip4p potential .",
    "these authors found at low temperatures values close to the results of our classical simulations , but at high @xmath6 they obtained values somewhat higher ( less negative ) than those found here , e.g. , at 250 k they found @xmath69  gpa vs our value of 0.99 gpa .",
    "this difference is presumably due to differences between the interatomic potentials employed in both calculations , as the tip4p deals with rigid water molecules and the q - tip4p / f takes into account their flexibility , allowing for bending and stretching of the intramolecular bonds .",
    "simulations of the amorphization of ice ih using classical molecular dynamics were also carried out by tse and klein,@xcite who found ice amorphization at pressures around 1.21.3 gpa at temperatures between 80 and 100 k , close to the spinodal @xmath66 obtained here .",
    "we remark that values of the bulk modulus calculated from pimd simulations in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble show relative error bars larger than those obtained for other variables ( e.g. , molar volume , kinetic energy , or interatomic distances ) , as a consequence of the statistical uncertainty in the volume fluctuations @xmath70 , employed to calculate the bulk modulus .",
    "an alternative way to derive @xmath46 consists in calculating numerically the derivative @xmath71 from the @xmath5@xmath58 equation of state at temperature @xmath6 .",

    "we show results for interatomic distances in ice ih between atoms in the same and adjacent molecules .",

    "is reduced , as could be expected from the associated volume decrease ( @xmath73 ) . nevertheless , contrary to the case of the crystal volume , the isothermal lines corresponding to the o ",
    "o distance do not cross each other , so that at higher temperature one finds a larger distance in the whole metastability region of ice ih .    for",
    "an homogeneous and isotropic expansion ( or contraction ) of the crystal , one expects for small volume changes : @xmath74 , @xmath75 being any distance in the solid , and one would expect this relation to be fulfilled , in particular , for the intermolecular distances in the solid .",
    "however , although this relation is roughly followed in the parameter range considered here , it is obvious that it can not be strictly accomplished , given the apparent different trends of the curves shown for crystal volume and o  o distance in figs .  1 and 4 .",
    "in particular , volume curves at different temperatures cross each other , whereas those corresponding to the o ",
    "o distance follow a regular pattern without crossings . the molar volume at low temperature ( @xmath6 = 50 k ) decreases by 7.0% when going from atmospheric pressure to @xmath5 = 1 gpa , from where one would expect a relative change in the average o  o distance of 2.3% .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than the change actually obtained from the simulations , i.e. , 1.8% . on the other side , at negative pressure we find a relative volume increase of 20.4% at @xmath5 = -1.35 gpa ( close to the spinodal pressure @xmath49 ) , which would correspond to a relative change in the o  o distance of 6.8% .",
    "in fact , we find from the simulations an increase in the o  o distance of 6.3% , slightly smaller than that expected for an homogeneous and isotropic crystal expansion .",
    "this indicates that expanding or contracting the ice crystal is accompanied by a distortion of the tetrahedral network of water molecules .",
    "this kind of distortion is also related to the negative thermal expansion of ice ih occurring at low temperatures , and that was earlier found to be reproduced by pimd simulations with the q - tip4p / f potential.@xcite    for comparison with the results of pimd simulations , we also show in fig .",

    "we now consider the interatomic distances inside water molecules in the ice crystal , as derived from our simulations at different pressures . in fig .",
    "5 we have plotted the mean intramolecular o ",
    "h distance as a function of pressure at three temperatures . concerning this figure",
    ", there appear two results that should be emphasized .",
    "first , at a given pressure we observe that the o  h distance decreases as temperature is raised , contrary to the usual expansion of atomic bonds for increasing @xmath6 .",
    "second , at a given temperature , we find that the o  h bond distance increases for rising pressure , which may seem also surprising given the pressure - induced volume contraction .",
    "both facts are due to the characteristic structure of ice with hydrogen bonds connecting contiguous water molecules , and can be explained by the same argument : an increase in the intramolecular o  h distance is associated to a weakening of the o ",
    "h bond , and is caused by a hardening of the intermolecular h bond . for rising @xmath6 , molecular motion is enhanced , so that hydrogen bonds become softer , and the average intermolecular o ",
    "h distance increases ( in line with the rise in o  o distance shown above and in ref .  ) .",
    "this gives rise to a strengthening of the intramolecular o ",
    "h bonds , with the associated decrease in interatomic distance in water molecules .",
    "this hardening of intramolecular o ",
    "h bonds for rising temperature has been observed experimentally and reported in the literature.@xcite for increasing pressure at a given temperature , we find something similar : the intermolecular o ",
    "o distance is reduced as the pressure rises ( see fig .  4 ) , in such a way that the intermolecular h bonds become stronger , causing weaker and longer intramolecular o  h bonds .",
    "the rise in o ",
    "h distance derived from our simulations in the range between 0 and 1 gpa is consistent with an increase of about @xmath77  / gpa , given in refs . for high - pressure ice phases ,",
    "although smaller values have been found in ref . .",
    "note , however , that the change of intermolecular o  o distance with pressure is much larger than that of the intramolecular o ",
    "h distance .",
    "thus , at 50 k the change in @xmath72(o  o ) in the whole metastability region of ice ih ( from @xmath5 = 1.38 to 1.12 gpa ) is about 8% , whereas the change in intramolecular o ",
    "h distance is about 1% .",
    "this is indeed a consequence of the direct effect of pressure in changing the intermolecular distance , to be compared with an indirect effect on the intramolecular o ",
    "h bond strength caused by intermolecular h bonds .",
    "we finally note that the intramolecular o ",
    "h distance increases appreciably due to quantum nuclear effects .",
    "in fact , a classical simulation at @xmath6 = 50 k and ambient pressure yields a mean o ",
    "h distance of 0.969  , to be compared with 0.984   derived from pimd simulations , which means an increase of 1.5% in the bond length .",
    "this difference is much larger than the temperature - induced change in @xmath72(o ",
    "h ) shown in fig .  5 .",
    "however , the increase due to quantum motion is rather constant in the whole pressure range studied here , i.e. at negative and positive pressures we find a rise in o ",
    "h distance of about 1.5% .      here",
    "we present results for the atomic mean - square displacements @xmath20 defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) .",
    "one expects that this spatial delocalization will be larger for hydrogen than for oxygen , due to the smaller mass of the former . in fig .",
    "6 we display values of @xmath20 for hydrogen in ice ih as a function of pressure .",
    "data were derived from pimd simulations at different temperatures . at a given pressure",
    ", @xmath20 increases as the temperature is raised , in the whole region where the solid is found to be metastable . at 50 k ( the lowest temperature shown here ) , @xmath20 changes very little as a function of pressure , except close to @xmath5 = 1 gpa , where it increases by a small amount as one approaches the spinodal point ( which at this temperature was found to be @xmath66 = 1.12 gpa ; see above ) . at higher temperatures , changes in @xmath20 as a function of pressure are more appreciable . at all temperatures considered",
    ", we find an increase in the atomic delocalization when approaching one of the spinodal points , at positive or negative pressure .",
    "the increase at positive pressure ( close to amorphization of the solid ) is clearly larger than that found at negative pressures . in fig .",
    "6 we also present the mean - square displacement of hydrogen atoms in ih , as derived from classical simulations at 50 k ( dashed line ) .",
    "these results are clearly lower than those of the pimd simulations at the same temperature .",
    "thus , at ambient pressure the classical result is @xmath78 @xmath79 , to be compared with @xmath80 @xmath79 found in the quantum simulations .    for oxygen",
    "we find mean - square displacements that change with pressure in a way similar to those of hydrogen .",
    "this is shown in fig .  7 at the same temperatures as in fig .  6 for hydrogen . at atmospheric pressure , we find for oxygen @xmath81 @xmath79 at 50 k vs 0.175 @xmath79 at 251 k. values of @xmath20 are larger for hydrogen than for oxygen , but the difference between both decreases for increasing temperature .",
    "thus , at @xmath6 = 50 k and @xmath5 = 1 atm , @xmath20 for hydrogen is 1.93 times the mean - square displacement for oxygen , whereas this ratio decreases to 1.13 at 251 k. this is in line with a larger quantum delocalization for hydrogen , caused by its lower mass , and the effect of the mass becomes less relevant as temperature increases .",
    "note that the mean - square displacement @xmath20 of a given atomic nucleus can be decomposed into a contribution @xmath23 coming from the spread of the quantum paths [ see eq .",
    "( [ qr2 ] ) ] , and another one , @xmath82 , given by the spatial displacement of the centroid @xmath83 of the paths.@xcite at 50 k and 1 atm , @xmath23 represents a 62% of @xmath20 for hydrogen and a 25% in the case of oxygen , which reflects the fact that the quantum contribution to the atomic delocalization is more important in the case of hydrogen .",
    "this can also be seen by directly comparing values of @xmath23 for the different atomic species , which result to be 4.8 times larger for h than for o at 50 k and atmospheric pressure .    at low temperatures , the quantum contribution ( spreading of the paths )",
    ", @xmath23 , dominates the spatial delocalization of hydrogen , since the centroid displacement , @xmath82 , converges to zero as @xmath84 k. the opposite happens in the high - temperature limit ( unreachable here for stability reasons ) , where the quantum contribution @xmath23 eventually disappears , as corresponds to the classical limit .",
    "we note in passing that at low temperatures the quantum paths associated to hydrogen have an average extension of about 0.15  , much smaller than the h ",
    "h distance in a water molecule , thus justifying the neglect of quantum exchange between protons in the pimd simulations .    in fig .",
    "7 we also show mean - square displacements of oxygen atoms , as derived from classical simulations at 50 k ( dashed line ) . as one could expect , these values are smaller than those derived from pimd simulations , but in the case of oxygen the difference between both sets of results , although nonnegligible , is not so important as for hydrogen .",
    "in fact , at ambient pressure we found for oxygen @xmath85 @xmath79 in classical simulations vs @xmath86 @xmath79 derived from pimd simulations .",
    "note that the classical result is similar to that found for hydrogen at the same pressure and temperature , but the quantum @xmath20 for h is clearly larger than that of o atoms . also , quantum effects on the mean - square displacement for oxygen decrease rapidly as temperature is raised .",
    "thus , at @xmath6 = 150 k and @xmath5 = 1 atm we find in the classical simulations @xmath87 @xmath79 , to be compared with @xmath88 @xmath79 derived from pimd simulations , i.e. , quantum effects increase @xmath20 by a 12% at this temperature .",
    "the kinetic energy of atomic nuclei in a solid or molecule depends on the mass and delocalization of the considered nucleus .",
    "thus , although in a classical approach , each degree of freedom contributes to the kinetic energy by an amount that depends only on temperature ( @xmath89 , as given by the equipartition principle ) , in a quantum approach the kinetic energy , @xmath90 , gives information on the environment and interatomic interactions seen by the considered particle .",
    "in particular , a typical quantum effect related to the atomic motion in solids is that the kinetic energy at low temperature converges to a finite value associated to zero - point motion , contrary to the classical result where @xmath90 vanishes at 0 k. path integral simulations allow us to calculate the kinetic energy of the quantum particles under consideration , which is related to the spread of the quantum paths .",
    "in fact , for a particle with a certain mass and at a given temperature , the larger the mean - square radius - of - gyration of the paths , @xmath23 , the smaller the kinetic energy , in line with the expectancy that a larger quantum delocalization causes a reduction in the kinetic energy.@xcite here we have calculated @xmath90 by using the so - called virial estimator , which has an associated statistical uncertainty appreciably lower than the potential energy of the system.@xcite    we present separately the kinetic energy of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in ice ih . in fig .",
    "8 we display @xmath90 for hydrogen as a function of pressure at three different temperatures , as derived from our pimd simulations . at each considered temperature , @xmath90 increases as pressure rises , corresponding to an overall increase of vibrational frequencies . @xmath90",
    "also increases with temperature , but the data for @xmath91 50 and 100 k ( not shown in the figure ) are almost indistinguishable , since at these temperatures the hydrogen vibrations are nearly in their ground state .",
    "higher vibrational modes are excited at higher temperatures , and at 251 k we observe an increase in @xmath90 larger than 0.1 kj / mol in the whole metastability range of ice ih .",
    "values of @xmath90 calculated at @xmath5 = 1 atm coincide with those presented earlier from pimd simulations in the range from 210 to 290 k.@xcite    the kinetic energy of hydrogen atoms in ice ih was obtained by reiter _",
    "et al._@xcite at ambient pressure from inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "these authors found at 269 k a kinetic energy @xmath90 = 12.7 kj / mol , somewhat lower than those found here at @xmath5 = 1  atm in the temperature range from 250 to 290 k , i.e. , @xmath90 for hydrogen between 14.39 and 14.44  kj / mol .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the pressure dependence of the kinetic energy of oxygen in ice ih at four temperatures . as for hydrogen , for",
    "oxygen @xmath90 also grows for increasing pressure at a given temperature .",
    "however , now the isothermal lines at 50 and 100 k are clearly distinct by more than 0.2 kj / mol , as a consequence of the higher mass of oxygen , which produces a lower vibrational energy and an appreciable excitation of vibrational modes at 100 k. from the results for the kinetic energy of h and o shown in figs .  8 and 9",
    ", we observe that at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures , @xmath90 for a hydrogen atom in ice ih is about 4 times larger than that of an oxygen atom . at 50",
    "k the kinetic energy of hydrogen increases from 13.96 kj / mol at @xmath5 = 1.35 gpa to 14.32 kj / mol for 1  gpa .",
    "this represents an increase of 0.36 kj / mol , i.e. , 2.6% in the whole pressure range . for oxygen ,",
    "the increase in @xmath90 in the same region is about twice that of hydrogen ( @xmath92 = 0.75 kj / mol ) , but its relative change is much more important for o ( a 26.5% ) .    close to the amorphization pressure of ice we observe a slow increase in the kinetic energy for both hydrogen and oxygen , without any appreciable change in its trend .",
    "this contrasts with the trend observed for the atomic mean - square displacements @xmath20 shown above in figs .  6 and 7 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath90 is related to the spread of the quantum paths , as measured by the mean - square displacements @xmath23 , and not to the centroid motion , which represents displacements of the overall paths , irrespective of their size and shape .",
    "the fast increase in @xmath20 close to the spinodal points is mainly due to an increase in the centroid delocalization @xmath82 .",
    "we have presented results of pimd simulations of ice ih in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble at different pressures and temperatures .",
    "this kind of simulations have allowed us to study this water phase in the pressure region where it is metastable , and approach the spinodal points at which it becomes mechanically unstable . at @xmath0 we found a spinodal pressure @xmath49 ranging from 1.4 to 0.7 gpa in the temperature range from 50 to 300 k. at positive pressures , we obtained a spinodal in the range @xmath93 1.11.3 gpa , that is well defined at temperatures @xmath94 100 k. at higher temperatures , kinetic processes favor amorphization of the solid for pressures clearly lower than the estimated spinodal pressure .",
    "although the molar volume decreases with increasing pressure , the interatomic distances in the solid change in a peculiar way that remembers their temperature dependence . thus , the distance between oxygen atoms in neighboring molecules decreases for increasing pressure , but the intramolecular o ",
    "h distance becomes larger for higher pressure .",
    "this is a consequence of the hydrogen bonds connecting contiguous molecules , which become stronger as the volume ( or o  o distance ) is reduced , causing a weakening of the intramolecular o",
    " h bonds .    for the bulk modulus of ice ih ,",
    "we obtain a maximum at 0.30.5 gpa , which increases slowly as the temperature is lowered . at",
    "higher and lower ( negative ) pressures , @xmath46 is found to decrease and extrapolates to zero at the corresponding spinodal pressure ( @xmath49 or @xmath66 ) .",
    "close to the spinodals , we observe an increase in the atomic delocalization for both oxygen and hydrogen atoms , especially at temperatures in the order of the melting temperature of ice ih . for the kinetic energy ,",
    "however , we do not observe any anomalous effect , and it is found to increase smoothly as temperature or pressure is raised .    we have assessed the importance of quantum effects by comparing results obtained from pimd simulations with those yielded by classical simulations . concerning the stability of ice ih ,",
    "we have found that quantum effects reduce the metastability region of this solid phase , for both positive and negative pressures . at low temperatures , this means that both spinodal pressures @xmath49 and @xmath66 are shifted by about 0.3 gpa .",
    "structural variables also change when quantum nuclear motion is considered .",
    "thus , the crystal volume , interatomic distances , and atomic delocalization suffer appreciable modifications in the range of temperature and pressure considered here .",
    "most important is the increase in the mean - square displacement of hydrogen , which contributes to weaken the intermolecular h bonds , and to strengthen the intramolecular o  h bonds .",
    "an extension of this work can consist in studying the high - density amorphous phase obtained from ice ih under pressure , as well as other amorphous water phases , which may show peculiar properties as a function of pressure and temperature .",
