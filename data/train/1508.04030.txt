    "wireless optical communication ( uwoc ) systems are receiving growing attention for various underwater applications .",
    "as opposed to their traditional counterparts , i.e. , acoustic communications , they have three main superiorities : higher bandwidth , lower latency and better security .",
    "therefore , uwoc system can be regarded as an alternative to meet the requirements of high speed and large data underwater communications such as imaging , real - time video transmission , high throughput sensor networks , etc @xcite",
    ". however , presently , uwoc is suitable only for ranges that are typically less than @xmath3 m which hinders its extensive usage .",
    "this drawback is due to the fact that uwoc suffers from three main impairing effects : absorption , scattering and turbulence which cause loss , inter - symbol interference ( isi ) and fading on the received optical signal , respectively .",
    "many studies have been focused on characterizing absorption and scattering effects of different water types , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "based on the experimental results reported in @xcite , tang - dong - zhang simulated uwoc channel by means of monte carlo ( mc ) approach considering absorption and scattering effects @xcite .",
    "they also fitted a double gamma function ( dgf ) to this impulse response and evaluated ber numerically , however in the absence of turbulence effects . recently ,",
    "akhoundi - salehi - tashakori @xcite proposed a cellular ocdma - based uwoc network where a specified optical orthogonal code ( ooc ) @xcite is assigned to each user .",
    "furthermore , potential applications and challenges of such a network is elaborated in @xcite .    although many valuable studies have been performed to characterize and mitigate turbulence - induced fading in free - space optical ( fso ) communications @xcite , its impairing effects on the performance of uwoc systems have received relatively less attention .",
    "however , some relevant and useful researches have recently been reported in the literature to characterize underwater fading statistics .",
    "for example in @xcite an accurate power spectrum has been derived for fluctuations of turbulent seawater refractive index .",
    "furthermore , rytov method has been used in @xcite to evaluate the scintillation index of optical plane and spherical waves propagating in underwater turbulent medium . and in @xcite ,",
    "the on - axis scintillation index of a focused gaussian beam has been formulated in weak oceanic turbulence and by considering log - normal distribution for intensity fluctuations the average ber in such systems is evaluated .",
    "it has been shown that the three aforementioned impairing factors in underwater medium are incremental functions of distance @xcite .",
    "this behaviour hinders on the system performance for longer ranges . to overcome this limitation and therefore to extend the viable communication range , in this paper we propose multi - hop transmission over turbulent underwater channel . by this scheme ,",
    "we divide a relatively long communication distance with severe absorption , scattering and fading effects to shorter ones , each with a much reduced absorption , scattering and fading effects ; and therefore with acceptable performance .",
    "1 depicts an explanatory practical example of our proposed topology , namely underwater optical sensor network .",
    "underwater sensor networks will acquire essential roles in investigating climate changes , disaster prevention , in monitoring biological , biogeochemical , evolutionary and ecological changes in the sea , ocean and lake environments , in pollution monitoring , and in helping to control and maintain oil production facilities . in this scheme",
    ", each sensor should ultimately upload its own data to the optical base transceiver station ( obts ) .",
    "since these sensors are battery powered , their low - power signals will not withstand to reach a relatively far - located obts due to severe absorption , scattering and fading effects of the channel . in this circumstance ,",
    "a comparatively simple relay can be implemented near this network to detect the received data and forward the detected data to the next relay ( or to the obts in the last hop ) .",
    "further , each sensor transmits its data based on ooc - ocdma technique @xcite to introduce multiple access capability while reducing its interfering effect on the other sensors signals . in general , in such difficult circumstances the relay - assisted strategy is a reasonable solution as opposed to designing an exclusive obts nearby the network , since relay nodes employment is much simpler and straightforward than obtss @xcite",
    ". moreover , different cells obtss are sufficiently distant to provide longer range communications and also to reduce implementation costs .",
    "hence , to develop temporary repeaters , implementation of simple relay nodes with narrow field of view ( fov ) receivers and narrow / wide beam lasers / leds is more interesting than complicated omnidirectional obtss .",
    "also the required processes in relays are much simpler than those of obtss , which involve different layers of network processes @xcite .",
    "in addition , our study of relay - assisted topology covers the more practical scenario of cooperative communication where different users operate as repeaters for each other .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the channel and system models in the context of relay - assisted ocdma network are investigated . in section iii , some simplifying assumptions are made in order to approximate the ber of a relay - assisted underwater ocdma network . using gaussian approximation to calculate the chip error rates ( cers ) of different hops ,",
    "the end - to - end bers for both uplink and downlink transmissions are obtained .",
    "further , we clarify how to obtain ber performance of a single - user relay - assisted point - to - point uwoc link as a special case of the aforementioned up - or downlink bers . in section",
    "iv , numerical results for various configurations are presented , and finally we conclude the paper in section v.",
    "through propagation of optical beam in underwater medium , interactions between each photon and seawater particles consist of absorption and scattering .",
    "energy loss of non - scattered light , due to absorption and scattering can be characterized by absorption coefficient @xmath4 and scattering coefficient @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "further , extinction coefficient @xmath6 describes the total effect of absorption and scattering on energy loss .",
    "the values of these coefficients can vary with source wavelength @xmath7 and water types @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that absorption and scattering have the lowest effect at the interval @xmath8 nm @xmath9 nm , so uwoc systems employ the blue / green region of the visible light spectrum to transmit and receive data . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the channel impulse response has been simulated based on mc approach with respect to the both absorption and scattering effects . in this paper",
    "the fading - free impulse response between any two @xmath10th and @xmath11th nodes is denoted by @xmath12 . to attain this impulse response , we simulated the channel similar to @xcite and @xcite based on mc approach in order to thoroughly include absorption and scattering effects .    in uwoc systems ,",
    "optical turbulence is the main cause of fading on the propagating optical signal through turbulent seawater .",
    "optical turbulence occurs due to random variations of refractive index .",
    "these random variations in underwater medium mainly results from fluctuations in temperature and salinity @xcite . to characterize turbulence effects , we multiply @xmath13 by a ( positive ) multiplicative fading coefficient @xmath14 @xcite",
    ". weak oceanic turbulence can be modeled with log - normal distribution @xcite as ; @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the mean and variance of the gaussian distributed log - amplitude factor @xmath18 . to ensure that the fading coefficient conserves energy , we normalize fading amplitude such that @xmath19=1 $ ] , which implies @xmath20 @xcite . therefore , in describing the fading statistics , it demands finding the dependency of log - amplitude variance @xmath21 to the ocean turbulence parameters where we will discuss in the remaining of this subsection .",
    "the scintillation index of a light wave with intensity @xmath22 is defined by @xcite ; @xmath23-\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}^2[{i_{ij}}]}{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}^2[{i_{ij}}]}=\\frac{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}[{{\\tilde{h}}^2_{ij}}]-\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}^2[{{\\tilde{h}}_{ij}}]}{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}^2[{{\\tilde{h}}_{ij } } ] } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath24 is the fading - free intensity .",
    "scintillation index can be considered as a threshold for separating the weak and strong turbulence regimes , i.e. , when this parameter is smaller than unity the channel is in weak turbulence and vice versa @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that under the assumption of weak turbulence the scintillation index of plane and spherical waves can be calculated as ; @xmath25d\\kappa d\\xi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 for plane and spherical waves , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the wave number , propagation distance and scalar spatial frequency , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 is the power spectrum of turbulent fluctuations which has the form @xcite ; @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\frac{{\\chi } _ t}{w^2}\\left(w^2e^{-a_t\\delta } + e^{-a_s\\delta } -2we^{-a_{ts}\\delta } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid , @xmath34 m is the kolmogorov micro - scale , @xmath35 is the rate of dissipation of mean - square temperature and @xmath36 is the relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuations which takes on values in the interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "other parameters in are as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for turbulent channels with log - normal fading distribution the scintillation index is related to the log - amplitude variance as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for relatively weak oceanic turbulence the scintillation index ( which is comprehensively evaluated in @xcite ) directly yields the log - amplitude variance and consequently specifies fading coefficients probability density function ( pdf ) in .",
    "it is worth noting that given a set of conditions , e.g. , the link range , the water type , inherent optical properties ( iops ) , etc .",
    ", each of the aforementioned three impairing effects of the channel can be a serious concern .",
    "for example , as the water turbidity increases the absorption and scattering coefficients increase too .",
    "therefore , in turbid harbor waters absorption and scattering are very important and should be treated , e.g. , using multi - hop transmission . on the other hand",
    ", the severity of turbulence , which is measured by the scintillation index , depends on the values of the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath36 .",
    "based on the experimental results in @xcite the typical values of @xmath44 are between @xmath45 @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath46 . also @xmath43 takes the values between @xmath48 @xmath49 to @xmath50 @xmath49 .",
    "hence , depending on the values of these parameters , strong turbulence can occur at ranges as short as @xmath51 m and as long as @xmath3 m @xcite , which impressively differs from atmospheric channels where strong turbulence distances are on the order of kilometers .",
    "therefore , alleviating such a strong turbulence requires more studies .",
    "th user in its @xmath27th time slot.,width=326 ]    we consider a collection of @xmath52 underwater users which are located nearby each other and are communicating with a relatively distant receiver or obts .",
    "to simultaneously and asynchronously share the medium among the various users , a specific ooc code with weight @xmath53 and length @xmath54 is assigned to each user , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are bit and chip duration times , respectively . to guarantee that auto - and crosscorrelation constraints @xmath57 and @xmath58 are equal to unity ,",
    "maximum allowable number of users is upper bounded by ; @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the integer portion of the real value @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "as stated in the previous section absorption , scattering and fading effects are distance - dependent and their severity increases for longer ranges .",
    "this issue motivates the idea of placing intermediate nodes , namely relay nodes , between the users and the destination to alleviate the above mentioned disturbing effects . therefore , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) we have located @xmath62 intermediate relays in a serial topology between the users and the destination to increase the viable communication range .",
    "this topology is also suitable when there is no line - of - sight to the destination . in order to simplify relays structure , chip detect - and - forward ( cdf ) strategy",
    "is employed at the relay nodes . in this scheme",
    ", each relay simply detects the received chips based on an appropriate threshold and forwards the detected chips to the next ( or final ) node .",
    "it is obvious that chip detection process in the first relay @xmath63 is affected by multiple access interference ( mai ) ; however , this interference does not affect the chip detection process in the remaining relays and the destination , since each of these nodes only receives the transmitted signal by the previous node .    as it is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the @xmath64th user s @xmath27th time slot transmitted ocdma - based pulse shape , @xmath65 , has the form ; @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath64th user s chip power and is related to the average transmitted power per bit of this user as @xmath68 .",
    "and @xmath69 is the @xmath64th user s ooc code with length @xmath70 and weight @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 is a rectangular pulse with duration @xmath56 and unit amplitude , i.e. , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a rectangular pulse with unit amplitude in the interval @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the transmitted ocdma - based signal of the @xmath64th user , @xmath75 , can be expressed as ; @xmath76 in which @xmath77 is the @xmath64th user s transmitted bit on its @xmath78th time slot , representing on - off keying ( ook ) modulation .",
    "furthermore , the received optical signal from the @xmath64th user to @xmath63 , after having propagated through the channel with impulse response of @xmath79 , can be represented as ; @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the aggregated channel impulse response of the first hop from the @xmath64th user to the first relay , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 denotes the convolution operation .",
    "@xmath84 is the @xmath64th user s delay time with respect to the first relay receiver s reference clock . in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath84 to be chip synchronous with an integer multiple of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "note that each of the @xmath52 users produces similar contribution in the first relay .",
    "hence , the total received optical signal at the front end of the first relay s detector can be summarized as ; @xmath85 moreover , various types of noises , i.e. , background light , dark current and thermal noise all affect the system performance . in this paper we adopt poisson distributed background light and dark current and gaussian distributed thermal noise @xcite",
    ".    we should emphasize that our system model and analytical derivations are general and valid for when the transmitters use collimated laser beams or diffusive light emitting diodes ( leds ) .",
    "however , from the practical point of view , since the users can be mobile , tracking and pointing issues suggest to use diffusive links for the first hop .",
    "in other words , in order to reduce the pointing and tracking difficulties , it is preferable to use leds or lasers with enough wide divergence angles as transmitters of the first hop , during both up - and downlink transmissions .",
    "also due to the same reason , receivers with larger fov are preferable for the first hop . on the other hand , since relay nodes are fixed , the pointing and tracking troubles decrease for the intermediate hops .",
    "therefore , collimated links using narrow beam divergence lasers are more suitable for these hops to better save energy and reduce the channel temporal spreading .",
    "further , if the destination node is a fixed simple receiver , collimated link is more favorable to better save energy and mitigate isi . finally , for the depicted topology in fig .",
    "1 , where destination is an obts , due to the physical properties of obts @xcite the transmitter of the last hop must have relatively a wide beam divergence angle to better illuminate the separate photodetectors of the obts .",
    "to evaluate ber , we assume the first user as the desired user and the remaining users as undesired interfering users . hence , the average ber of the desired user under the assumption that all users transmit bits  @xmath27 \" and  @xmath86 \" with equal probability , can be evaluated as ; @xmath87 in which @xmath88 and @xmath89 are bit error probabilities when bits  @xmath27 \" and  @xmath86 \" are transmitted , respectively . to obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ", we first make the following two assumptions :      we assume that all of the users transmit with a chip rate in which the main portion of the energy of the received optical signal @xmath90 is confined in the interval @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 under this assumption we can conclude that isi has a negligible effect on the system performance .",
    "further , in order to more accurately take into account the loss due to absorption and scattering , we simulate the channel impulse response by mc approach and we guarantee by adopting users data rate not to exceed the predetermined value indicated by . taking into account that the channel delay spread is much smaller than @xmath56 , the channel loss coefficient on a given chip can be determined as ; @xmath93    it is worth mentioning that as the link range , water turbidity and transmitter beam divergence angle increase the channel imposes more attenuation ( loss ) and time spreading on the propagating optical signal . on the other hand ,",
    "as the receiver fov increases the channel spreading time increases too . in these conditions , the assumption in leads to larger values for @xmath56 and hence limits the transmission data rate to smaller values .",
    "we assume that all users have the same transmit power as @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , each relay after detecting the received chips , forwards each  on \" chip with power @xmath94 .    in",
    "what follows , we apply the aforementioned two assumptions to analyze the bers of the uplink and downlink transmissions .      in this section",
    "we focus on the @xmath27th time slot transmitted bit of the first ( desired ) user .",
    "all the other users transmit their signals asynchronously which cause mai on the desired user .",
    "therefore , with respect to the aforementioned two assumptions and , we can express the uplink received signal at @xmath63 as ; @xmath95 which is composed of two main parts : desired and the undesired mai signals .",
    "let us define @xmath96 as the interference pattern occurred on the pulsed mark chips of the first user s ooc , where @xmath97 is the number of interferences on the @xmath98th pulsed mark chip of the desired user s ooc .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath99 as the total number of interferences that occurred on all the chips of the desired user , i.e. , @xmath100 . the random variable ( rv ) @xmath99 , which specifies the number of interfering users on the desired user , has a binomial distribution function .",
    "the joint probability distribution function of the interference pattern can be represented as @xcite ; @xmath101 therefore to evaluate , or equivalently @xmath102 , we need to evaluate the ber conditioned on @xmath99 and @xmath103 .",
    "then , the unconditioned error probability can be evaluated as ; @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the binary complement of the @xmath27th time slot transmitted bit of the first user @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the set of all interference patterns with @xmath99 interfering users .",
    "moreover , to evaluate @xmath108 we first need to calculate conditioned on fading coefficients vector @xmath109 and then average the conditional ber over @xmath109 as ; @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the joint pdf of fading coefficients in @xmath109 . note that @xmath109 may be different for each of up - and downlink transmissions .",
    "we will specify this vector at the end of each subsection for each of configurations .",
    "different rules can be adopted at the receiver side to decide on the transmitted data bits regarding the detected chips . due to the positive nature of incoherent ocdma systems ,",
    "the presence of interfering users manifests its effect as an increase on the photoelectrons count .",
    "therefore , mai is more likely to cause errors on the chips  off \" rather than on the chips  on \" . in order to mitigate this asymmetry in error probabilities for chips  on \" and  off \" , we employ the methodology introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the methodology is based on the following decision rule which imposes more restrictions on the correct detection of bit @xmath112 : decide that the transmitted bit was ",
    "@xmath86 \" if all detected chips are  on \" and otherwise recognize",
    " @xmath27 \" as the transmitted data bit . in this case ,",
    "conditional error probabilities in can be characterized as follows ;    [ p_be ] @xmath113,\\!\\ !    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which @xmath114 and @xmath115 are conditional end - to - end chip error rates on the @xmath98th transmitted chip of the desired user when this chip is  off \" and  on \" , respectively . to obtain approximate end - to - end cers",
    ", we make the following assumption : although it is possible to detect a chip correctly at the receiver despite of incorrect detection in some of the intermediate relays , we neglect these lucky events and assume that a chip can be detected correctly at the receiver if and only if it is transmitted without any error over all intermediate hops .",

    "therefore , to determine and we begin by calculating cer of each intermediate hop .      here",
    "we calculate the conditional chip error probabilities of the first hop using gaussian approximation , which provides an acceptable estimate of the system error rate specially for error probability values less than @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the first relay s receiver simply integrates over each @xmath56 seconds and compares the result with an appropriate threshold to detect the received chip @xcite .",
    "in addition to this signal , poisson distributed dark current and background light ( with mean photoelectron count rates of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively ) and gaussian distributed thermal noise are added to the received signal count in each @xmath56 seconds . therefore , photo - detected signal after integrate - and - dump circuit of the first relay can be modeled as ; @xmath124 in which @xmath125 is a vector with @xmath53 uncorrelated gaussian distributed elements each with mean zero and variance of ; @xmath126 corresponding to the integrated thermal noise @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper , we characterize the performance of relay - assisted underwater wireless optical code division multiple access ( ocdma ) networks over turbulent channels . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to scattering and absorption effects of underwater channels , we also consider optical turbulence as a log - normal fading coefficient in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> to simultaneously and asynchronously share medium among many users , we assign a unique optical orthogonal code ( ooc ) to each user in order to actualize ocdma - based underwater network . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant challenge in underwater optical communication is in the ability to extend the short range of its coverage . in order to expand the viable communication range , we consider multi - hop transmission to the destination . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we evaluate the performance of a relay - assisted point - to - point uwoc system as a special case of the proposed relay - assisted ocdma network . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results indicate significant performance improvement by employing intermediate relays , e.g. , one can achieve @xmath0 db improvement in the bit error rate ( ber ) of @xmath1 using only a dual - hop transmission in a @xmath2 m point - to - point clear ocean link .    </S>",
