    "we have measured 21-cm absorption spectra toward a sample of 252 hiiregions .",
    "this study produces two distinct data products : a consolidated census of hiiregions with known radio recombination line ( rrl ) velocities , taken from the literature ; as well as the hiemission and absorption spectrum pairs towards them - within the bounds of the sgps ( 255@xmath0353 ) .",
    "these two resources will enable further study into the structure and dynamics of the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) in the fourth quadrant ( on which massive stars and their formation have a significant impact ) .",
    "the catalogs will serve as a data set for numerous studies ; including investigations of the spiral structure of the galaxy ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) and kinematic distance works , both for target regions ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) as well as for the intervening hiclouds ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the sgps i provides both the hiline data , as well as the continuum maps @xcite used for source detection and identification .",
    "the sgps provides three distinct data products : parkes continuum - subtracted cubes , with an angular resolution of @xmath2 ; combined parkes and australia telescope compact array ( atca ) continuum - subtracted hicubes ( 2.2 ) and combined parkes and atca cubes containing continuum emission ( @xmath3 ) . for this work we use the continuum _ included _ combined parkes - atca data .",

    "firstly we compiled a list of hiiregions from rrl catalogs for the longitude and latitude range of the sgps .",

    "it is not surprising that the sgps with angular resolution of @xmath4 detects multiple sources within the larger beam of the early hiiregion discovery works , for instance the parkes beam of @xcite is @xmath5 .",

    "the name ( in form `` g longitude @xmath7latitude '' ) reported for each hiiregion is taken from the catalog from which the region is provided ( see  [ hiicatalogs ] ) ; hence the inconsistencies in decimal precision .",

    "hiiregions are considered to be the archetypical tracers of galactic spiral structure @xcite ; but cold , dense gas , traced by hiabsorption is also more likely to be located within the spiral arms than in the inter - arm region .",
    "each black marker on the figure corresponds to five consecutive velocity channels which display significant absorption .",
    "it is clear that the hiabsorption is also associated with the spiral arms .",
    "this is to be expected , as dense , cold gas which is traced by hiabsorption is more likely to be located within the spiral arms than in the inter - arm regions .",
    "we find hiabsorption associated with all inner galaxy spiral arms .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] not only demonstrates the suitability of both data - sets ( hiiregion velocities and hiabsorption ) as spiral arm tracers , but also their inherent velocity uncertainty distributions .",
    "galactic streaming motions are often estimated to be on the order of @xmath59 km s@xmath28@xcite , i.e. within the velocity width of the crayon diagram features .",
    "however , hiabsorption associated with hiiregions can extend @xmath50 km s@xmath28beyond the systemic velocity of the region @xcite .",
    "the association of hiabsorption with a galactic structure feature can be used to infer lower distance limits , or the location of the hiiregion in our galaxy @xcite .          from figure [ fig5 ]",
    "it is evident that this catalog is primarily limited to the inner galaxy ( within the solar circle ) ; unlike , for example , the work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the sgps and the e / a spectrum extraction method to study hiabsorption towards 111 extragalactic continuum sources - in order to investigate absorption from the outermost arms of the milky way .",
    "of these 111 sources , only 17 demonstrated any signature of hiabsorption at positive velocities ; corresponding to a location in the outer galaxy .    because the @xcite source sample included strictly extra - galactic sources , the hiabsorption spectra reflect lines of sight through the entire galactic plane .",
    "whereas spectra from this study reflect lines of sight towards the hiiregions themselves , located within the galaxy . for this reason ,",
    "this work is far less likely to identify hiabsorption in the outermost spiral arms in the fourth quadrant - as the number of hiiregions known ( with rrl velocities ) is extremely limited in the most distant features .",
    "nevertheless , for longitudes @xmath60 the line of sight distance to the solar circle is relatively small and investigations of hiabsorption in the outer galaxy become possible ; although at these longitudes , there are very few known hiiregions ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",

    "the left hand panel , supplementary to figure [ fig5 ] , is an @xmath1 diagram extended to @xmath68 over the velocity range of the near 3kpc arm .",
    "channels of significant absorption are shown , in addition to those from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 linear fits to the locus of the near 3kpc arm from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath69 km s@xmath28 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath70 km s@xmath28 ) and this work ( see equation [ eqboth ] ) are also shown .",
    "in the right hand panel an evaluation of the fit is made .",
    "all velocity channels shown in the left - hand panel are compared to the linear near 3kpc arm fit ( similar to the co 1 - 0 , figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the near 3kpc arm is identified as a well defined peak in hiabsorption , centered around the fit to the linear model ( however , the scale height of the component is exaggerated by the removal of non - near 3kpc arm absorption for @xmath71 ) .",
    "the hump at @xmath72 ( i.e. velocities consistent with a line parallel to equation [ eqboth ] @xmath73 km s@xmath28 ) may be the signature of the norma arm , which is approximately parallel to the near 3kpc arm in @xmath1 space for longitudes @xmath49 ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) . the broad central peak is the result of the remaining disk rotation , both foreground and background to the near 3kpc arm .",
    "note that longitudes @xmath62 the far 3kpc arm is confused in velocity with the other inner galaxy spiral arms - therefore investigation of the locus of the far 3kpc arm , extending the work of @xcite , is not possible here .",
    "the first attempt to test and interpret hiemission / absorption spectrum pairs from the sgps ( test region ) was performed by @xcite . however , until now , no complete census of hiabsorption towards galactic continuum sources in the sgps has been completed .",
    "this paper presents , in graphical , numerical and summary formats , the hiemission and absorption spectrum pairs from every known galactic hiiregion distinctly detectable in the sgps ( 255@xmath0353 , @xmath74)a total of 252 regions .",
    "we have demonstrated one use of this catalog by examining the @xmath1 distribution of hiabsorption in the milky way  including a re - evaluation of the locus of the near 3kpc arm in @xmath1 space .",
    "this catalog has the potential to be an integral data set for numerous works ; perhaps even sparking the invigoration of the search for hispiral arms of the milky way in absorption , rather than emission , as @xcite predicted .",
    "this research has made use of of nasa s astrophysics data system ; the simbad database and vizier catalogue access tool , cds , strasbourg , france ; and matplotlib for python @xcite .",
