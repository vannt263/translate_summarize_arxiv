    "today the universe appears spatially flat undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "there are many measurements proving this pictures @xcite . according to the successful cosmological model @xcite , there are two main ingredients in this scenario , namely dark matter ( dm ) and the cosmological constant @xmath0 ( dark energy ) . on the galactic scales ,",
    "the evolution is driven by the usual newtonian gravitational potential , but it needs hypothesizing the existence of dm to obtain a good experimental agreement .",
    "a good model for the galactic distribution of dm , in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , is the navarro - frenk - white model ( nfw model ) @xcite .",
    "however in recent years , the effort to give a physical explanation to the cosmic acceleration has attracted an amount of interest in so called fourth order gravity ( fog ) , and particularly the @xmath1-gravity , where @xmath2 is a generic function of ricci scalar @xmath3 and the lagrangian of the theory is @xmath4 .",
    "these alternative models have been considered as a viable mechanism to explain the cosmic acceleration .",
    "other issues , of astrophysical nature , as the observed pioneer anomaly problem @xcite can be framed into the same approach @xcite , even if the anomaly has been shown to be attributable to well - understood classical mechanisms of radiation reaction @xcite .",
    "apart the cosmological dynamics , a systematic analysis of such theories were performed at short scale and in the low energy limit @xcite .    although fog is investigated at theoretical level as alternatives to gr with dark energy and /or dm , an analytical approach to galactic rotation curves",
    "have been considered for @xmath1-gravity @xcite and for a @xmath5-gravity @xcite , with @xmath6 , where the hilbert - einstein lagrangian , @xmath7 , is substituted by @xmath8 .",
    "in fact in these papers one does not consider a correction to scalar ricci but one substitutes it by a power law for the ricci scalar .",
    "in such way one find yet a newtonian gravitational potential ( @xmath9 ) with an added power law correction .    by evaluating the rotation curve for a generic gravitational potential",
    "we want , in this paper , to use the potential induced by a @xmath10-gravity , where for sake of simplicity we set @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then we generalize the hilbert einstein lagrangian by introducing a generic function depending not only on the ricci scalar @xmath3 but also on other two curvature invariants @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ricci tensor and @xmath17 is the riemann tensor . the gravitational potential is obtained when the newtonian limit of theory with lagrangian @xmath18 is performed @xcite .",

    "the corrections to potential can modify the global rotation curve and the dm model can undergo a modification .",

    "our aim is to evaluate the corrections to the classical motion in the easiest situation : the circular motion . in this case",
    "we do not consider the radial and vertical motion .",
    "the condition of stationary motion on the circular orbit is    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the velocity .",
    "the distribution of mass can be modeled simply by introducing two sets of coordinates : the spherical coordinates @xmath74 and the cylindrical coordinates @xmath75 .",
    "an useful mathematical tool is the gauss flux theorem for gravity : _ the gravitational flux through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed mass_. the law is expressed in terms of the gravitational field .",
    "the gravitational field @xmath76 is defined so that the gravitational force experienced by a particle with mass @xmath77 is @xmath78 . since the newtonian mechanics satisfies this theorem and , by thinking to a spherical system of mass distribution , we get , from ( [ stazionary_motion ] ) , the equation    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the only mass enclosed in the sphere with radius @xmath81 .",
    "the green function of the @xmath10-gravity ( @xmath82 ) , instead , does not satisfy the theorem @xcite . in this case",
    "we must consider directly the gravitational potential ( [ sol_gen ] ) .",
    "apart the mathematical difficulties incoming from the research of gravitational potential for a given mass distribution , the non - validity of gauss theorem implies , for example , that a sphere can not be reduced to a point .",
    "in fact the gravitational potential generated by a ball ( also with constant density ) is depending also on the fourier transform of ball @xcite . only in the limit case where the radius of ball is small with respect to the distance",
    "we obtain the simple expression ( [ sol_pointlike ] ) .",
    "however in this paper we want to consider not the simple case of motion of body in the vacuum , but the more interesting case of motion in the matter .",
    "so we must leave any possibility of idealization and consider directly the calculation of the potential ( [ sol_gen ] ) .",
    "two last remarks on the ( [ sol_gen ] ) are needed .",
    "the two corrections have different algebraic sign , and in particular the yukawa correction with @xmath55 implies a stronger gravitational force , while the second one ( purely induced by ricci and riemann square ) contributes with a repulsive force . by remembering that the motivations of extending the outcome of gr to new theories is supported by missing matter justifying the flat rotation curves of galaxies , the first correction is a nice candidate . a crucial point is given by the spatial range of correction .",
    "in fact the yukawa corrections imply a massive propagation ; then , more massive is the particle , shorter is the spatial range . in fig .",

    "the behavior of gr is shown by the solid line .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath87 runs between @xmath88 with step @xmath89 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the inverse of length.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    at last in newtonian mechanics the gauss theorem gives us a spherically symmetric gravitational potential even if the spherically symmetric source is rotating . in gr as well as in fog , however ,",
    "the rotating spherically symmetric source generates an axially symmetric space - time ( the well known kerr metric ) and only if the source is at rest one has the space - time with the same symmetry ( the well known schwarzschild metric ) . then the galaxy being a rotating system will generate an axially symmetric space - time while we are using the solution ( [ sol_gen ] ) .",
    "this aspect is not contradictory because the solutions are calculated in the newtonian limit ( _ i.e. _ @xmath90 ) and under this assumption the kerr metric collapses into schwarzschild metric .",
    "in fact we have    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the angular momentum along the z - axis .",
    "from the point of view of morphology , a galaxy can be modeled by considering at least two components : the bulge and the disk .",
    "obviously the galaxy is a more complicated structure and there are others components , but for our aim this idealization is satisfactory .",
    "the bulge , generally , can be represented easily with cylindrical coordinates ( but in a more crude idealization it is like a ball ) , while the disk has a radius bigger than the thickness .",
    "however we find that the rotation curve does not present the keplerian behavior outside the matter , but the curve remain constant for any distance .",
    "then we must formulate the existence of exotic matter that can justify the experimental observation .",
    "a simple discussion about the distribution of dm can be formulated by imposing the constant value of velocity in ( [ circular_velocity ] ) for large distances .",
    "in fact we find    @xmath97    a matter distribution as ( [ density_dm ] ) has a problem when we want to calculate the total mass .",
    "in fact if we have @xmath98 , the mass diverges .",
    "a such exotic behavior seems no - physical , but this outcome is only the consequence of constant rotation curve .",
    "in fact by increasing the distance also the mass must increase with the power law for any distance ( [ circular_velocity ] ) .",
    "however , since the gauss theorem holds in gr , the matter outside the sphere of integration does not contribute to the gravitational flux and then we do not have difference with respect to the ordinary matter .",
    "this same argumentation is not valid in @xmath10-gravity : the no viability of gauss theorem implies that the range of integration of dm could cover all range and also the matter outside is considered .",
    "a cut off is needed now . in this paper",
    "then for completeness we consider that the galaxy is composed by three components : the bulge , the disk and an alone of dm .",
    "it should be noted that the spatial behaviors of dm ( generally spherically symmetric ) are made only _ a posteriori _ : the cornerstones of study of rotation curves are the gr and the distribution of ordinary matter . only after this assumption",
    "the distribution of dm is such as to justify the gap between the theoretical prediction and the experimental observation .    before jumping to analysis of rotation curves",
    "we want to resume the principal spatial distributions of mass in the three galactic components . in literature",
    "there are many forms of density , but it is possible to resume them as follows .",
    "more realistic models are the ones with mass density depending also on the @xmath99-coordinate for bulge and disk",

    "so we say that the presence of matter has been not considered and the choice of arbitrary constant has been evaluated only by matching @xmath5-gravity with gr in the limit @xmath173 .",

    "only solutions with constant values are allowed , but the algebraic sign is crucial .",
    "a such behavior is expected any time we have the condition @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "now in all these considerations we do not recover the condition @xmath188 : then we have a theory which do not provide us the minkowskian limit .",
    "it is using the first perturbative contribution of a metric component ( providing the flatness at infinity ) , while other contributions in the remaining metric components ( negligible in the newtonian limit ) do not cover the same asymptotic limit .",
    "then only for @xmath189 we can have the flatness at infinity .",
    "then we could say that for @xmath189 the minkowskian limit is recovered but a such perturbative approach can be performed only in the vacuum .",
    "the objection previously shown comes back .",
    "up to third order ( @xmath190 or @xmath191 ) the geometrical side of field equation is identically null , but the matter side could not be null at first order ( @xmath192 or @xmath193 ) .",
    "the class of @xmath5-gravity are examples of theories where the weak field limit procedure does not generate automatically the minkowskian limit .",
    "in fact only if we consider theories satisfying the condition @xmath194 @xcite , their weak field limit is compatible with the request of asymptotically flatness .",
    "moreover @xmath138-gravity mimicking an additional source due to its scalar curvature @xcite we would have a constant matter that pervades all space giving us a justification of more intense gravitational potential .",
    "in addition if @xmath195 we do not have the minkowskian limit , but we can interpret the apparent mass , only from the experimental point of view , as dm .",
    "these aspects , then , can be a mathematical motivation for different shape of point - like gravitational potential , but also source of further attention .",
    "in this paper we computed the study of galactic rotation curve when a fog is considered . among the several theories of fourth order we considered a generic function of ricci scalar , ricci and riemann tensor .",
    "we started from the outcome of previous papers about the point - like solutions in the so - called weak field limit of theory and formulated the expression of rotation curve by inserting in the model the principal galactic components : the bulge , the disk and the dm component . in this limit",
    "we used the superposition principle for the potential since the newtonian limit correspond also to the linearized version of theory . since in fog",
    "the gauss theorem is not valid , the calculus of potential is performed directly by integrating in all space and obtaining in the potential also the information about the spatial shape of mass distribution .",
    "apart the mathematical difficulties incoming from the research of gravitational potential the non - validity of gauss theorem implies , for example , that a sphere can not be generally reduced to a point .    among two corrective contributions yukawa - like to newtonian",
    "potential seems that only one induced by a generic function of ricci scalar is a good candidate ; in fact this contribution has the same algebraic sign of newtonian component and we can detect a more attractive force .",
    "a such situation can justify partially the bigger observed velocity , while the term induced by ricci tensor ( and by the riemann tensor ) acts lowering the velocity .",
    "the rotation curves have been evaluated by considering the bulge and the dm component spherically symmetric and the disk as a circular plane where the radius is larger than the thickness .",
    "also in our case of fog with ordinary matter we find that the rotation curve has the keplerian behavior and only if we add the dm component we have a nice matching between theoretical and experimental data .",
    "however the hypothesis of existence of dm make two serious problems : since the matter distribution of dm is diverging when we consider the whole amount of mass is crucial the choice of cut - off inside the integral .",
    "other hot point is the choice of the mass model of dm , or minimally the values of free parameters in the model .",
    "if we consider the gr as the theory of gravity , we can have different values from those obtained if we choice the fog .",
    "the spatial behaviors of dm ( generally spherically symmetric ) are made only _ a posteriori_.    the proposed models have been compared with the data of milky way and ngc 3198 obtaining the best fit for @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in both cases we found a nice outcome for given values of free parameters of mass model .",
    "however the initial aim to extend the gr to a new class of theories , as we claimed in the introduction , has the hope to justify the _ rotation curve without the dm component_. from the previous outcomes , while the @xmath10-gravity , or better a @xmath138-gravity , admits a more attractive force , on the other hand these modifications are not successful . _",
    "also in this framework we need dark matter_. obviously we need a smaller amount of dm on the middle distances , but for large distances we have the same problems of gr .",
    "we conclude the paper by comparing our outcome with the one of @xmath5-gravity .",
    "in fact the problem of dm seemed to be solved by using a such theory .",
    "particularly the constant rotation curves would be obtained without the dm . by finding a corrective term as power law in the radial distance one",
    "had a nice matching .",
    "but the model is not completely satisfactory .",
    "it is in our opinion that @xmath5-gravity is misplaced but it contains some interesting and valid contributions .",
    "if the comparison with the experimental data encourages us to continue on this road , on the other hand , there are some mathematical pathologies that must be carefully evaluated .",
    "furthermore , we think that a good weak field limit at small velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ the newtonian limit , of any theory of gravity must always satisfy the condition of minkowskian flatness .",
    "in addition , a nice self - consistent theory , from a mathematical point of view , must be placed .",
    "it is obvious that can be considered also the weak field limit on the cosmological background and in this case we do not require the minkowskian limit .",
    "since , today , there is not a successful model to explain the rotation curve without requiring the existence of dm , but there are many partially acceptable models , we can say that , regardless of its detection , it remains an hard challenge to interpret the dark matter as a single geometric phenomenon .",
    "the authors would like to thank v.f .",
    "cardone and y. sofue for their useful suggestions about the galactic experimental data and f. siano for his advice on writing the software for numerical simulations ."
