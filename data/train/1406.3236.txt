    "the transverse polarization of @xmath1 hyperons produced in inclusive unpolarized hadron - nucleon , hadron - nucleus , and nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energies is a well - established phenomenon .",
    "the polarization @xmath2 measured in these experiments with hadron beams is perpendicular to the production plane spanned by the momentum vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the beam and the produced @xmath0 , respectively , which is the only direction allowed by parity conservation for an axial - vector quantity and unpolarized beams and targets .",
    "a substantial transverse @xmath0 polarization was first observed in proton - beryllium collisions at a proton - beam energy of 300  gev @xcite . since then , numerous experiments using a variety of beams and targets have been performed to study this effect in detail . for a review of experiments and results",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the polarization is essentially independent of the beam momentum ; its magnitude rises with @xmath5 , the @xmath0 momentum component transverse to the beam direction , for @xmath5 values up to about 1 gev , where it reaches values of up to @xmath6 ; then , it is independent of @xmath5 up to the highest measured @xmath5 values of about 3 gev . at fixed @xmath5 ,",
    "* @xmath7 * rises with the feynman variable @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the component of the @xmath0 momentum in the beam direction measured in the beam - target center - of - mass system and @xmath10 is its maximal possible value .",
    "the transverse polarization depends only weakly on the atomic - mass number @xmath11 of the target nuclei  @xcite , whereas the polarization for beryllium appeared to be of slightly smaller magnitude than that for h and d  @xcite .",
    "a relative reduction of the magnitude of the polarization by about 20@xmath12 was observed for copper and lead targets compared to beryllium .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 remained small in relativistic heavy - ion collisions up to @xmath13  gev . at higher transverse momenta ,",
    "@xmath2 measured in such experiments was found to be similar to that observed in p - p or p - nucleus scattering  @xcite . for proton and neutron beams , the measured polarization is negative , i.e. , the polarization vector @xmath14 and the normal @xmath15 to the production plane have opposite directions , while for @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath17  @xcite beams the polarization is positive in the forward direction ( @xmath18 ) and for @xmath19 beams  @xcite it is positive in the backward hemisphere ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in contrast , the polarization is compatible with zero for @xmath21 and @xmath22 beams .",
    "while the transverse polarization of hyperons was studied in detail with hadron beams , very little experimental information about @xmath2 is available from photo- or electroproduction .",
    "the @xmath23 dependence observed in early measurements  @xcite was very similar to the one seen in @xmath19-p reactions , but the data were of low statistical accuracy .",
    "more recently , the  experiment has obtained for the first time statistically significant experimental results on the transverse @xmath0 polarization in inclusive quasireal photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the measured polarization is positive in both the forward and the backward directions .",
    "the analysis presented in ref .  @xcite combined the data collected by the   experiment in the years 19962000 using mostly hydrogen and deuterium targets .",
    "more data were collected in the years 20022005 with the target nuclei h , d , @xmath24he , ne , kr , and xe , which allowed for the study of the dependence of @xmath2 on the atomic - mass number @xmath11 of the target nuclei .",
    "the results of all these measurements are presented here .",
    "the data were accumulated by the  experiment at the  accelerator facility of . the 27.6  gev lepton ( electron or positron ) beam passed through a 40  cm long open - ended tubular storage cell internal to the lepton storage ring .",
    "the storage cell was filled with polarized or unpolarized target gas of the various elements .",
    "part of the data was collected using a transversely or longitudinally polarized hydrogen target and a longitudinally polarized deuterium target , respectively .",
    "the direction of the target polarization was reversed in 13  min intervals , resulting in a vanishing average target polarization of the data set .",
    "the  detector is described in detail in ref .",
    "it was a forward magnetic spectrometer with a geometric acceptance confined to two regions in scattering angle , arranged symmetrically above ( top ) and below ( bottom ) the beam pipe and covering ranges of @xmath25(40140 )  mrad in the vertical and @xmath25170  mrad in the horizontal component of the scattering angle with respect to the center of the target cell .",
    "the criteria for data selection and the analysis procedure are similar to those described in detail in ref .",
    "the scattered lepton was not required to be detected . in this case the data sample is dominated by the kinematic regime of quasireal photoproduction with @xmath26  gev@xmath27 , ( where @xmath28 represents the squared four - momentum of the virtual photon exchanged in the electromagnetic interaction ) .",
    "the kinematic distribution of the quasireal photons was obtained from a monte carlo simulation of the process using the  event generator  @xcite and a  @xcite model of the detector .",
    "the energy distribution obtained from this simulation is nearly flat in the region @xmath29",
    "626  gev with a broad maximum near 13  gev . below and above this region",
    "it drops rapidly to zero , resulting in an average photon energy of @xmath30  gev .",
    "the @xmath0 events were detected through their @xmath31 decay channel , by requiring the presence of at least two hadron candidates of opposite charges . in the event selection",
    "the fact was used that in the laboratory system the momentum of the decay proton is always larger than the pion momentum for @xmath0 momenta above @xmath32  mev .",
    "the information from a dual - radiator ring - imaging cherenkov counter was used to assure that the positive hadron was not a pion . when more than one positive or negative hadron was found in an event ,",
    "all possible combinations of oppositely charged hadron pairs were considered .",
    "all tracks were also required to satisfy a series of fiducial - volume cuts designed to avoid the inactive edges of the detector .",
    "furthermore , both hadron tracks were required to be reconstructed in the same spectrometer half to avoid effects caused by possible misalignment of the two spectrometer halves relative to each other .",
    "this requirement reduced the number of @xmath0-event candidates by @xmath33 .",
    "track reconstruction was performed with a track - fitting algorithm based on the kalman filter with substantially improved vertex determination and momentum resolution compared to the one used for the data published previously .",
    "this algorithm allows for the best - possible estimates on track parameters at the beam crossing and/or at the ( possible ) vertices with other tracks of a given event .",
    "two spatial vertices were reconstructed for each event : the @xmath0-decay vertex from the intersection of the proton and pion tracks and the @xmath0-production vertex from the intersection of the reconstructed @xmath0 track with the nominal beam axis .",
    "the @xmath0-production vertex was required to be downstream of the upstream end of the target cell and the decay vertex was required to be at least 40 cm downstream of the center of the target cell .",
    "the latter requirement was chosen as a compromise between statistical precision and low background of the data sample and the need to avoid  for data taken with a polarized target  any residual influence of the target s magnetic field on the polarization measurement .    for tracks fulfilling all the above given requirements",
    "the invariant mass of the hadron pair was evaluated .",
    "the resulting invariant - mass distributions for the combined hydrogen and deuterium ( h+d ) and the combined krypton and xenon ( kr+xe ) data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "these distributions are very similar for all nuclei .",
    "they were fitted by a gaussian plus a second - order polynomial line shape .",
    "compared to the data published previously  @xcite , the resolution @xmath34 of the mass reconstruction was improved from 2.23 mev to 1.80 mev .",
    "the position of the @xmath0 peak agrees within @xmath35 mev with the world average of ( 1115.683 @xmath25 0.006 ) mev  @xcite .",
    "events within an invariant - mass window of @xmath36 around the mean value of the gaussian fit were selected , and background events , @xmath37 , were subtracted with the procedure described in ref .",
    "the background is small , the fraction @xmath38 of @xmath0 events in the selected mass window being @xmath39 for all targets .",
    "the topology of @xmath0 production and decay is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] where the decay into a proton and a pion is shown in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "the method of extraction of the transverse @xmath0 polarization is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the parity - violating @xmath31 decay , the angular distribution of the decay protons in the @xmath0 rest frame",
    "is given by @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the decay distribution for unpolarized @xmath0 hyperons , @xmath42 is the angle between the proton momentum and the normal @xmath43 , and @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the decay protons are preferentially emitted along the spin direction of the @xmath0 in its rest frame .",
    "this provides the possibility of obtaining the @xmath0 polarization by measuring the asymmetry in the proton s angular distribution .    for a detector with @xmath45 acceptance ,",
    "the polarization is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the first moment of the angular distribution and @xmath48 is the number of @xmath0 events analyzed .",

    "[ eq : eq2 ] can be strongly distorted . for the determination of @xmath2",
    "the mean value of @xmath49 for the _ unpolarized _ distribution , @xmath50 , must be known with good precision . for a detector with ideal top / bottom mirror symmetry",
    ", there is an important simplification : the first moment for unpolarized @xmath0 events vanishes ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , i.e. , all even `` polarized '' moments are equal to the `` unpolarized '' ones .",
    "this allows for the determination of @xmath2 using only the experimentally measured values for @xmath54 without the need for a monte carlo simulation of the spectrometer acceptance : @xmath55    the numerator in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq3 ] represents the measured asymmetry in the angular distribution while the denominator stands for the analyzing power in the case of nonuniform acceptance . for the  spectrometer , the top / bottom mirror symmetry is not absolutely perfect and eq .",
    "[ eq : eq3 ] is only a good approximation .",

    "[ fig : ptdep ] the polarizations are shown as a function of @xmath5 .",

    "the @xmath5 dependence in these two intervals is rather different . in the region @xmath80 ,",
    "where the produced @xmath0 hyperons mainly stem from the backward region , the polarization increases linearly with @xmath5 up to a value of @xmath81 at @xmath82 gev ( closed circles ) , while in the region @xmath83 ( closed squares ) the polarization is substantially smaller with very little dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties of the kr+xe data prevent a firm conclusion about the @xmath5 dependences in the two @xmath67 regions .",
    "the polarization is compatible with zero over the whole @xmath5 range although the average polarization in the region @xmath80 is @xmath84 , while it is @xmath85 in the region @xmath83 .",
    "it should be noted that the measured ratio of @xmath0 yields for ( kr+xe ) and d decreases with @xmath67 and increases at large @xmath5 .",

    "the polarizations obtained for hydrogen and deuterium targets , and consequently for free protons and neutrons , agree within their statistical accuracies . for the combined hydrogen and deuterium data the measured polarization decreases with the variable @xmath67 that provides an approximate measure of whether the @xmath0 hyperon was produced in the forward or in the backward region in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath69-nucleon reaction . for small @xmath67 ( @xmath80 ) ,",

    "in contrast to measurements in hadron - nucleus scattering  where the magnitude of the polarization for heavier nuclei appears to be somewhat smaller than for light nuclei but still substantially different from zero  the polarization for the combined kr+xe data from the present measurement , integrated over @xmath5 and @xmath67 , is compatible with zero within the statistical uncertainties and about four standard deviations below the combined h+d result . at low @xmath67 and @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. , in the backward hemisphere , the kr+xe results seem to agree within their statistical uncertainties with the h+d results , such that the overall reduction possibly stems mainly from the forward direction .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that a fraction of the detected @xmath0 particles and their polarization originates from decays of heavier hyperons like @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "so far , the transverse polarization of these hyperons in quasireal photoproduction is unknown as is its dependence on the nuclear target mass .",
    "it is difficult to formulate theoretical implications of these results in general terms , i.e. , without recurring to specific models . for hard processes",
    "intuitive physical pictures were proposed in the literature to explain qualitatively the origin of single - spin asymmetries ( ssas ) and especially of transverse hyperon polarization ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . the usual factorization of qcd processes into products of distribution functions , hard amplitudes , and fragmentation functions",
    "@xcite requires a large momentum in the hard amplitude .",
    "this requirement is not fulfilled for quasireal photoproduction and at the relatively small transverse momenta of the present experiment , as opposed to deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "still , a smooth dependence on the virtuality @xmath92 of the photon would be expected such that a comparison of results from single - spin asymmetries in leptoproduction and in p - p and p - a collisions as well as corresponding theoretical calculations  @xcite is interesting , especially because even the sign of theoretical expectations is still under debate ; see ref .  @xcite .",
    "recently , the theoretical situation seems to have been clarified by ref .",
    "@xcite , which stressed that @xmath5-dependent fragmentation plays an important role .",
    "if so , one might also expect sizable asymmetries in soft @xmath5-dependent fragmentation .",
