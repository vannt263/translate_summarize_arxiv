    "searches for extragalactic variable or transient astronomical phenomena are almost as old as modern optical astronomy .",
    "well - known examples are the searches for extragalactic variable stars by edwin hubble ( e.g. , hubble & humason 1931 ) and his successors , and the pioneering searches for supernovae ( sne ) by fritz zwicky ( e.g. , zwicky , humason , & gates 1960 ) . for many decades",
    ", these searches were mostly targeted at specific nearby ( redshift @xmath1 ) galaxies or clusters . in the late 1980s , norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) undertook a survey for sne in more distant galaxy clusters , resulting in the discovery of a type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) in the cluster ac 118 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this breakthrough achievement illustrated the potential of such surveys , though the observational costs of this project were considerable .",
    "perlmutter et al . ( 1990 , 1995 ) used the emerging new technologies of wide - field ccd imaging and image subtraction to carry out the first efficient surveys for high - redshift sne in clusters and in the field .",
    "these methods , employed by large international collaborations ( e.g. , perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 , schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) , have resulted in the discovery of hundreds of high-@xmath3 sne  ia .",
    "analysis of these objects indicates that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , 2004 , 2007 ; perlmutter et al . 1999",
    "; tonry et al . 2003 ; knop et al . 2003 ; astier et al .",
    "2006 ; wood - vasey et al .",
    "2007 ) ; see filippenko ( 2005b ) for a review .",
    "sne are not the only variable or transient objects that are luminous enough to be observed in distant galaxies",
    ". other types of objects include variable active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , hawkins & veron 1993 ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2002 ; sarajedini et al .",
    "2006 ) of various sorts , and optical transients associated with cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. van paradijs et al .",
    "we have undertaken a survey for sne and other transient or variable sources in the fields of galaxy clusters , the wise observatory optical transient search ( woots ; gal - yam & maoz 2000a , b ; gal - yam et al .",
    "our main motivation is to study sne in galaxy clusters . in particular , measurement of the cluster",
    "sn ia rate has interesting implications for sn ia progenitors and the origin of metals in the intracluster medium ( icm ; e.g. , gal - yam , maoz , & sharon 2002 ; maoz & gal - yam 2004 ) .",
    "another objective is to discover and quantify the occurrence of intergalactic sne ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2003a ) .    here",
    ", we describe the technical design of this survey , the data - analysis methods (   2 ) , and the sne we discovered (   3.1 ) , along with a brief report on other types of objects (   3.2 ) . in a companion paper ( sharon et al . 2007 ; paper ii )",
    "we derive from our sn sample a measurement of the rate of sne in galaxy clusters .",
    "the discovery of intergalactic sne by woots was reported by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "the cluster sample we surveyed was drawn from the only large galaxy - cluster catalog available at the time , by abell , corwin , & olowin ( 1989 ; hereafter aco ) .",
    "this catalog is based on selection of galaxy overdensities from photographic plates .",
    "it is thus prone to projection problems , particularly to superposition of several poor clusters or groups along the same line of sight , appearing as single richer systems .",
    "however , the catalog was shown to be largely uncontaminated by such superpositions in the redshift range considered for our study ( @xmath4 ; lucey 1983 ) . at the time woots",
    "was initiated , no large , x - ray - selected cluster catalogs were available .",
    "the clusters were selected using the following criteria .",
    "first , all aco clusters with measured redshifts @xmath5 in the compilation of struble & rood ( 1991 ) were considered .",
    "this redshift range was chosen so as to include clusters that are generally more distant than those studied by previous search programs ( e.g. , reiss et al . 1998 ; @xmath6 ) , while still sufficiently nearby that sne in the cluster galaxies are detectable with the @xmath7 m telescope at wise observatory . to ensure proper visibility from wise",
    ", we limited the sample to northern - hemisphere clusters with declinations @xmath8 . seeking to increase the number of galaxies per field",
    ", we selected only rich clusters ( abell richness class @xmath9 ) with an abell galaxy count of @xmath10 .",
    "we also required that the radius of the clusters , as estimated by leir & van den bergh ( 1977 ) , be smaller than @xmath11 , in order for most of the cluster galaxies to fall within the @xmath12 field of view of the wise observatory tektronix ccd imager . applying these cuts to the aco catalog",
    ", we ended up with 161 galaxy clusters . during",
    "the survey runs , we observed two additional clusters that had similar properties and were known gravitational lenses .",
    "the final cluster sample , including 163 entries , is listed in table 2.1 .",
    "the cluster sample defined above is not uniformly distributed on the sky , with most of the targets at relatively high galactic latitudes . in order to optimize the use of allocated telescope time",
    ", we supplemented our cluster target list with a secondary list of empty fields in the vicinity of the clusters residing in sparsely populated sky areas ( abell numbers 24913 ; 22442694 ) .",
    "this secondary list of targets was imaged when additional telescope time was available , after all suitable cluster targets had been imaged .",
    "these additional data were searched for sne in the same manner as the cluster fields ( leading , e.g. , to the discovery of sn 1999fd ) ."
