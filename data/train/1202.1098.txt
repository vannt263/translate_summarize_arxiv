    "_ a question .",
    "_ there are countless situations in which some agents ( e.g. physical systems @xcite , computer processes @xcite , biochemical agents @xcite , economical agents @xcite , users of social networks , etc . )",
    "interact with their neighbours , leading to a global dynamics , the state of each agent evolving through the interactions . in most of these situations ,",
    "the topology , i.e. who is next to whom also varies in time ( e.g. agents become physically connected , get to exchange contact details , move around , etc . ) .",
    "the general concept of a dynamics caused by neighbour - to - neighbour interactions and with a time - varying neighbourhood , is therefore quite natural .",
    "+ at the mathematical level , however , this general concept turns out to be rather difficult to formalize .",
    "we can , of course , readily define some specific models which appear to fall in this category .",
    "but the more foundational question of understanding what defines ` causal dynamics with time - varying neighbourhoods ' in general , and what fundamental facts arise from the rigorous definitions we may put forward , is a slippery one.there are at least three difficulties .",
    "the first is that the neighbourhood relation plays a double role in this story , as it is both a constraint upon the global dynamics , and a subject of the global dynamics , which modifies it .",
    "the second is that , as agents get created and deleted , the notion of who has become whom is not so obvious , but this notion is needed in order to state the causality property that only neighbours may communicate in one step of time .",
    "the third is to express that the global dynamics should ` act everywhere the same ' , a property akin to translation - invariance  but arbitrary graphs do not admit such translations .",
    "_ two scenarios .",
    "_ in a mobile phone network , the agents could be the mobile phones , and their neighbours the mobile phones that they can call , i.e. the ones whose phone numbers is in their list of contacts . in this picture , the global state of the network can then thought of as a directed labelled graph , with each vertex representing a mobile phone having some internal state , and the edges representing the neighbourhood relation .",
    "the entire graph evolves in time , but this global dynamics emerges from a neighbour - to - neighbour interactions . in other words , during one call duration , information can only propagate to the nearest neighbour .",
    "although neighbours change in time , they do in a relatively controlled manner : new contacts are always contacts of contacts .",
    "sometimes new mobile phones get created , and others get thrown out . + in general relativity , the agents could be some particles which lie at particular locations of a smooth riemannian manifold , and the neighbours those particles which lie not too far away in the manifold , due to the absolute bound on the speed of information .",
    "the notion of bounded speed , however , is defined relative to the metric of the manifold , which changes in time according to the mass of the particles .",
    "again it changes in a relatively controlled manner , as far - away perturbations in mass repartition should not impact the local metric .",
    "sometimes particles scatter and others get emitted .",
    "_ two approaches .",
    "_ cellular automata research lies at the cross - point between physics , mathematics , and computer science .",
    "cellular automata consist of a grid of identical square cells , each of which may take one of a finite number of possible states .",
    "the entire array evolves in discrete time steps .",
    "the dynamics is required to be translation - invariant ( it commutes with translations of the grid ) and causal ( information can not be transmitted faster than a fixed number of cells per time step ) . whilst cellular automata are usually defined as exactly the functions having those physics - like symmetries , it turns out that they can also be characterized in purely mathematical terms as the set of translation - invariant continuous functions @xcite for a certain metric .",
    "moreover in a more computer science oriented - view , cellular automata can be seen as resulting from the synchronous application of the same local rule throughout the grid .",
    "these three complementary ways ( physical causality , mathematical continuity and constructive locality ) of addressing cellular automata are what anchors this field in rigorous foundations.this has led a large body of theoretical ( set theoretical properties , dynamical properties , decidability properties , connections with tilings etc . ) and applicative works ( modelling of anything from sea shells to traffic jams ) .",
    "still , restricting to a fixed grid has been perceived to be a limitation . as a consequence cellular automata definitions",
    "have been extended from grids to cayley or hyperbolic graphs , where most of the theory carries though @xcite .",
    "but these graphs are quite regular in many respects , for instance they are self - similar under translations .",
    "more recently cellular automata definitions have been extended to graphs @xcite , in order to describe certain distributed algorithms . in these extensions ,",
    "the topology remained fixed : they would be unable to account for evolving mobile networks , nor discrete formulations of general relativity @xcite .",
    "_ this paper aims at extending cellular automata theory to arbitrary , time - varying graphs .",
    "the theorems we prove are mainly inspired by those at the foundation of cellular automata theory .",
    "two of them show the equivalence of causality with local rule constructions ( theorem [ th : structure ] ) and continuity ( theorem [ th : continuity ] ) , and two others are closure properties by composition ( theorem [ th : composability ] ) and inversion ( theorem [ th : reversibility ] ) . _",
    "the second , related line of work is that of graph rewriting .",
    "the idea of rewriting graphs by applying some replacement rules has arisen as a natural generalization of term rewriting , and is now widespread in computer science @xcite .",
    "for instance it has been used in order to model situations ranging from the representation of programs with pointers and memory safety properties , to object - oriented software engineering paradigms . whilst cellular automata theory focuses on changing states and",
    "not the topology , graph rewriting focuses on changing the topology and not the states .",
    "but there are other fundamental differences . whilst cellular automata theory focuses on the global dynamics resulting from the synchronous application of the same local rule throughout the graph , graph rewriting theory usually focuses on asynchronous applications of a rule which need not be local , this leading to an undefined global dynamics ( hence the emphasis on properties such as confluence , non - interference , etc",
    ". ) . amalgamated graph transformations @xcite and parallel graph transformations @xcite are noticeable exceptions in this respect , as they work out rigorous ways to apply local rewriting rules synchronously throughout the graph .",
    "still the properties of the resulting global dynamics are not examined .",
    "_ this paper aims at extending the focus of graph rewriting to changing states , as well as to deduce aspects of amalgamated / parallel graph transformations from the axiomatic properties of the global dynamics . _    _ third way .",
    "_ the idea of a rigorous model of computation in which both the states and the topology evolve is certainly not new , and can be attributed to kolmogorov and upsenskii @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "these models , as well as the more recent @xcite , are again asynchronous in a sense .",
    "there is no spatial parallelism , although it may be simulated @xcite . lately , several groups have taken a more practical approach to this problem , and have started to develop simulation environments @xcite based on different programming paradigms , all of them implementing the idea of rewriting both the graph and its states via repeated applications of some replacement rules .",
    "these systems offer the possibility to apply the replacement rules simultaneously in different non - conflicting places . such an evaluation strategy does provide some weak form of synchronism . sometimes , when a set of rule is non - conflicting , this evaluation strategy happens to coincide with full synchronism . this pragmatic approach to extending cellular automata to time - varying graphs is advocated in @xcite , and has led to some advanced algorithmic constructions @xcite . _",
    "this paper aims at proposing simple formalizations of the notions of translation - invariance and causality when referring to functions from labelled graphs to labelled graphs .",
    "it aims at deducing , from these two notions , what is the most general form of fully synchronous application of a local rule throughout a graph , as well as to achieve a full characterization of what are the suitable local rules .",

    "the purpose of this paper was to study causal graph dynamics .",
    "we did so in a discrete - space , discrete - time , deterministic setting .",
    "let us summarize some of the main ideas and results , but in a different order . by causal ,",
    "we mean that information can not propagate faster than some fixed speed bound @xmath32 .",
    "we formalized this concept in an axiomatic manner , by stating that the internal state and connectivity @xmath202 of a vertex @xmath146 of @xmath203 must be a function of @xmath114 the disk of radius @xmath32 around some antecedent @xmath79 of @xmath11 .",
    "it is important that an axiomatization be general enough to encompass every possible case , but at the same time concrete enough not to remain a purely abstract mathematical object . here",
    ", the definition was shown to be equivalent to the more operational form @xmath204 , where @xmath112 is a local rule that gets applied in parallel everywhere , generating the subgraphs @xmath116 , then glued together by the union . notice that not all graphs can be glued together , some consistency conditions are required : we characterized the local rules @xmath112 that induce causal dynamics @xmath53 .",
    "notice also that in order to glue these graphs , we need to identify some vertices of @xmath115 with those of a nearby @xmath116 , perhaps avoiding collisions with the vertices of some far - away @xmath205 , say .",
    "hence , vertices need be named , and the way that @xmath112 generates new names from former names was made to respect the somewhat natural condition that @xmath206 implies @xmath207 .",
    "moreover , the fact that vertices are named ought not have an excessive impact over @xmath53 , whose behaviour ought to be roughly the same as names get changed through some injective function @xmath37 . this led us to impose the second condition that there always be some @xmath56 such that @xmath208 .",
    "in fact , the graph dynamics considered in this paper were restricted to respect these two conditions outright .",
    "this good behaviour of graph dynamics turns out to provide a robust notion of antecedent codynamics @xmath87 : the antecedents of the vertex name @xmath146 are those vertex names @xmath35 which are systematically present in the graphs @xmath11 that generate this name .",
    "+ the notion of causal graph dynamics was then instantiated into two concrete examples , which can be viewed as limiting cases : cellular automata feature complex internal state manipulations , whereas the inflating grid is an extreme case of time - varying neighbourhood .",
    "the robustness of the proposed notion was also ascertained by some mathematical , stability results : the composition of two causal graph dynamics is a causal graph dynamics whose local rule we can describe , moreover the speed bound @xmath209 is universal .",
    "the credit of cellular automata theory owes to such foundational results , as well as others , such as the curtis - hedlund - lyndon theorem , which characterizes them a translation - invariant , continuous functions for the cantor topology on words .",
    "this theorem works only for the space of infinite configurations , with cells taking their states in a finite alphabet .",
    "we similarly considered infinite graphs with vertices and edges having their states in a finite alphabet .",
    "no clear topology was at our disposal , but a notion of limit , which served to define continuity equally well , and obtain an equivalent of the theorem . from similar , compactness arguments",
    ", we also obtained that if a causal graph dynamics has an inverse dynamics , then this inverse dynamics is again causal .    _ future work .",
    "all of these results reinforce the impression that the notion of causal graph dynamics we have reached is both general and robust ; and at the same time concrete enough so that non - trivial facts can be said about them , and useful models be instantiated .",
    "similar specific - purpose models are in fact in use in a variety of contexts ranging from social networks to epidemiology @xcite or physics @xcite .",
    "several of these , however , include an extra ingredient of non - determinism , probabilities , or even quantum theory , which often are key ingredients of the physical situation at hand  whereas the setting of this paper has remained nicely deterministic for now .",
    "hence , studying probabilistic or quantum versions of causal graph dynamics ought to be promising .",
    "+ there are plenty positive theoretical results about cellular automata that need to be reevaluated in this more general context , in terms of set - theoretical properties , structure , order , dynamical properties , computability etc .",
    "more interestingly even , negative results , such as the suspected anisotropy of cellular automata , need to be reevaluated .",
    "good wills are welcome .",
    "more concretely , we leave it as an open question whether condition @xmath62 of definition [ def : dynamics ] can be relaxed to its binary form and the same results be obtained .",
