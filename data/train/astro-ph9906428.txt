    "since several years the dynamical and morphological properties of axisymmetric relativistic jets are investigated by means of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations ( van putten 1993 ; duncan & hughes 1994 ; mart 1994 , 1995 , 1997 ; komissarov & falle 1998 ; rosen 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , relativistic mhd simulations have been performed in 2d ( koide , nishikawa & muttel 1996 ; koide 1997 ) and 3d ( nishikawa 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "in their 3d simulations nishikawa have studied mildly relativistic jets ( lorentz factor 4.56 ) propagating both along and obliquely to an ambient magnetic field . in this letter",
    "we report on high - resolution 3d simulations of relativistic jets with the largest beam flow lorentz factor performed up to now ( 7.09 ) , the largest resolution ( 8 cells per beam radius ) , and covering the longest time evolution ( 75 normalized time units ; a normalized time unit is defined as the time needed for the jet to cross a unit length ; see massaglia , bodo & ferrari 1996 ) .",
    "the calculations have been performed with the high ",
    "resolution 3d relativistic hydrodynamics code genesis ( aloy 1999 ) , which is an upgraded version of the code developed by mart , mller & ibez ( 1994 ) and mart ( 1995 ) .",
    "genesis integrates the 3d relativistic hydrodynamic equations in conservation form in cartesian coordinates including an additional conservation equation for the density of beam material .",
    "the computations were performed on a cartesian domain ( x , y , z ) of size @xmath0 ( @xmath1 computational cells ) , where @xmath2 is the beam radius .",
    "the jet is injected at @xmath3 along the positive @xmath4-axis through a circular nozzle defined by @xmath5 .",
    "beam material is injected with a beam mass fraction @xmath6 , and the computational domain is initially filled with an external medium ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have considered a 3d model corresponding to model c2 of mart ( 1997 ) , which is characterized by a beam - to - external proper rest - mass density ratio @xmath8 , a beam mach number @xmath9 , and a beam flow speed @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the speed of light ) or a beam lorentz factor @xmath12 .",
    "an ideal gas equation of state with an adiabatic exponent @xmath13 is assumed to describe both the jet matter and the ambient gas .",
    "the beam is assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium .",
    "the evolution of the jet was simulated up to @xmath14 , when the head of the jet is about to leave the grid .",
    "the mean jet propagation speed @xmath15 , while the 1d estimate of the jet propagation speed ( see , mart 1997 ) gives @xmath16 , our simulations are still within the 1d phase ( see mart , mller & ibez 1998 ) .    non  axisymmetry was imposed by means of a helical velocity perturbation at the nozzle given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ratio of the toroidal to total velocity and @xmath19 the perturbation period ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the number of cycles completed during the whole simulation ) .",
    "the wavelength of the perturbation , @xmath22 , is obtained from the expression @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the axial dimension of the grid .",
    "we have considered a model with a @xmath25 perturbation in helical velocity ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 .",
    "figure[f : n50p01a ] shows various quantities of the jet in the plane @xmath28 at the end of the simulation .",
    "two values of the beam mass fraction are marked by white contour levels .",
    "the beam structure is dominated by the imposed helical pattern with a characteristic wavelength of @xmath29 ( to be compared with the value @xmath30 expected from the estimate of @xmath22 in the previous paragraph ) and an amplitude of @xmath31 .",
    "the overall jet s morphology is characterizad by the presence of a highly turbulent , subsonic , asymmetric cocoon .",
    "the pressure distribution outside the beam is nearly homogeneous giving rise to a symmetric bow shock ( fig.[f : n50p01a]b ) . as in the classical case ( norman 1996 )",
    ", our relativistic 3d simulation shows less ordered structures in the cocoon .",
    "the cocoon remains quite thin ( @xmath32 ) as long as the jet propagates efficiently .",
    "the flow field outside the beam shows that the high velocity backflow is restricted to a small region in the vicinity of the hot spot ( fig.[f : n50p01a]e ) , the largest backflow velocities ( @xmath33 ) being significantly smaller than in 2d models .",
    "the flow with high lorentz factor found in axisymmetric simulations ( see flow patterns in mart 1996 ) appears here restricted to a thin layer around the beam and possesses sub - relativistic speeds ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the backflow velocities in the cocoon do not support relativistic beaming .      within the beam",
    "the perturbation pattern is superimposed to the conical shocks at about 26 and 50@xmath2 .",
    "the beam does not exhibit the strong perturbations ( deflection , twisting , flattening or even filamentation ) found by other authors ( norman ( 1996 ) for 3d classical hydrodynamic jets ; hardee ( 1996 ) for 3d classical mhd jets ) .",
    "this can be taken as a sign of stability , although it can be argued that our simulation is not evolved far enough . obviously , the beam cross section and the internal conical shock structure are correlated ( bottom panel in figure[f : n50p01a ] ) . before the first recollimation shock the beam cross section shrinks to an effective radius of @xmath35 . after this shock and in the rarefaction the beam reexpands and stretches due to an elliptical surface mode ( hardee 1996 ) . between @xmath36",
    "the beam flow is influenced by the second recollimation shock , which causes a compression of the beam .",
    "a triangular mode seems to grow in this region .",
    "the helical pattern propagates along the jet at nearly the beam speed ( see animation at http://scry.uv.es/aloy.html/jets/videos/n50p01 ) which could yield to superluminal components when viewed at appropriate angles . besides this superluminal pattern",
    ", the presence of emitting fluid elements moving at different velocities and orientations could lead to local variations of the apparent superluminal motion within the jet .",
    "this is shown in fig.[f : apparent ] , where we have computed the mean ( along each line of sight , and for a viewing angle of 40 degrees ) local apparent speed .",
    "the distribution of apparent motions is inhomogeneous and resembles that of the observed individual features within knots in m87 ( biretta , zhou , & owen 1995 ) .",
    "the jet can be traced continuously up to the hot spot which propagates as a strong shock through the ambient medium .",
    "beam material impinges on the hot spot at high lorentz factors .",
    "we could not identify a terminal mach disk in the flow .",
    "we find flow speeds near ( and in ) the hot spot much larger than those inferred from the one dimensional estimate .",
    "this fact was already noticed for 2d models by komissarov & falle ( 1996 ) and suggested by them as a plausible explanation for an excess in hot spot beaming .",
    "we find a layer of high specific internal energy ( fig.[f : n50p01a]d ) surrounding the beam like in previous axisymmetric models ( aloy 1999 ) .",
    "a comparison with the backflow velocities ( fig.[f : n50p01a]e ) shows that it is mainly composed of forward moving beam material at a speed smaller than the beam speed .",
    "the intermediate speed of the layer material is due to shear in the beam / cocoon interface , which is also responsible for its high specific internal energy .",
    "the existence of such a boundary layer has been invoked by several authors ( komissarov 1990 , laing 1996 ) to interpret a number of observational trends in fri radio sources .",
    "swain , bridle & baum ( 1998 ) have found evidence for these boundary layers in friis ( 3c353 ) .",
    "the diffusion of vorticity caused by numerical viscosity is responsible for the formation of the boundary layer .",
    "although being caused by numerical effects ( and not by the physical mechanism of turbulent shear ) the properties of ppm  based difference schemes are such that they can mimic turbulent flow to a certain degree ( porter & woodward 1994 ) .",
    "hence , our calculations represent a first approach to study the development of shear layers in relativistic jets and their observable consequences .",
    "the structure of both the shear layer and the beam core are sketched in fig[f : shear_layer ] .",
    "the specific internal energy of the gas in the shear layer ( region with @xmath37 ) is typically more than one order of magnitude larger than that of the gas in the beam core .",
    "the shear layer broadens with distance from 0.2@xmath2 near the nozzle to 1.1@xmath2 near the head of the jet ( fig.[f : bound_cross_sect ] ) .      from the head s position at the end of the simulation ( @xmath38 ) a mean jet advance speed of 0.47@xmath11",
    "is obtained , but the jet s propagation proceeds in two distinct phases : ( i ) for @xmath39 the jet propagates roughly at the estimated 1d speed ( @xmath16 ) ; ( ii ) for @xmath40 the jet accelerates and propagates at a considerably larger speed ( 0.55@xmath11 ) . comparing with the 3d simulation of norman ( 1996 ) we find a similar behaviour : after a short 1d phase and before the deceleration , the jet transiently accelerates to a propagation speed which is @xmath41% larger than the corresponding 1d estimate .",
    "this result contradicts the one obtained by nishikawa ( 1997 , 1998 ) , who found a propagation speed of only 70% of the corresponding 1d estimate in a shorter ( @xmath42 20 normalized time units ) simulation of a denser jet . although the estimate do not take into account the effect of an extra magnetic pressure in the external medium opposing to the jet propagation , in the case of nishikawa simulations this magnetic pressure is negligible in comparison with the beam momentum density .",
    "figure[f : bound_cross_sect ] shows the axial component of the momentum of the beam particles ( integrated across the beam ) along the axis , which decreases by 30% within the first 60@xmath2 . neglecting pressure and viscous effects , and assuming stationarity the axial momentum should be conserved , and hence the beam flow is decelerating .",
    "the momentum loss goes along with the growth of the boundary layer whose material is accelerated and heated by viscous stresses .",
    "biconical shocks in the beam are responsible for the break in the axial momentum profiles at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , because when the beam material passes a conical shock and enters into the adjacent rarefaction fan , it is accelerated by local pressure gradients .",
    "how can the jet accelerate while the beam material is decelerating ?",
    "although the beam material decelerates , its terminal lorentz factor is still large enough to produce a fast jet propagation . on the other hand , in 3d , the beam is prone to strong perturbations which can affect the jet s head structure . in particular ,",
    "a simple structure like a terminal mach shock will probably not survive when significant 3d effects develop .",
    "it will be substituted by more complex structures in that case , by a mach shock which is no longer normal to the beam flow and which wobbles around the instantaneous flow direction .",
    "another possibility is the generation of oblique shocks near the jet head due to off ",
    "axis oscillations of the beam .",
    "although difficult to check quantitatively ( due to both the lack of an operative definition for mach disk identification and the present resolution of our simulations ) both possibilities will cause a less efficient deceleration of the beam flow at least during some epochs . at longer time scales the growth of 3d perturbations will cause the beam to spread its momentum over a much larger area than that it had initially , which will efficiently reduce the jet advance speed .",
    "we have presented a first attempt to analyze the morpho - dynamical properties of 3d relativistic jets . from our simulations",
    ", we can conclude that the coherent fast backflows found in axisymmetric models are not present in 3d models .",
    "we have investigated the beam s response to non - axisymmetric perturbations to check its stability . during the period of time studied by us ( @xmath45 )",
    ", the beam does not display the strong perturbations found by other authors in classical jets ( norman 1996 , hardee 1996 ) and propagates according to the 1d estimate .",
    "small 3d effects in the relativistic beam give rise to a lumpy distribution of apparent speeds like that observed in m87 ( biretta , zhou & owen 1995 ) .",
    "we have also analyzed the properties of the boundary layer present in our model .",
    "obviously , our study must be extended to a wider range of models and perturbations .",
    "in particular , stronger perturbations should be considered to reach the nonlinear regime and to identify the acoustic and mixing phases ( bodo 1998 ) leading to the jet disruption .",
    "further investigation also requires the dependence of the shear layer properties on the perturbation parameters .",
    "finally , appropriate perturbations can be studied that mimic the wiggles observed in specific sources both at pc ( 0836 + 710 , lobanov 1998 ; 0735 + 178 , gmez 1999 ) and kpc scales ( m87 ; biretta , zhou & owen 1995 ) .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the spanish dges ( grants pb97 - 1164 and pb97 - 1432 ) and the csic - max planck gesellschaft agreement .",
    "maa expresses his gratitude to the conselleria deducaci i cincia de la generalitat valenciana for a fellowship .",
    "the calculations were carried out on two sgi origin 2000 at the centre europeu de paral.lelisme de barcelona and at the centre de informtica de la universitat de valncia .",
