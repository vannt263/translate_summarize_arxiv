    "the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , and its verification by several observations @xcite-@xcite , motivate the theocratical physicists to propose such theories of gravity , which can extend general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the extension should be in such a way that observation can be justified by the modifications instead of introducing dark energy .",
    "it is well known that gr deals with the description of gravity at local scale but not at global scale , for example gr fails to explain the the rotation of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "several theories of gravity have proposed to generalized the einstein theory of gravity , but most of these theories are the geometric extension of gr which provide the essential ingredients to support the observations . among all these modifications , one can consider the @xmath3 theories , in which lagrangian can be expressed as a function of ricci scalar @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "analogous to @xmath3 theory of gravity there is another theory so - called @xmath0 theory , this theory is defined by the teleparallel equivalence of gravity ( tegr ) . in this theory gravitational action can be described by the torsion scalar @xmath1 instead of lagrangian . in @xmath0",
    "theory , riemann - cartan spacetime is defined with weitzzenb@xmath5ck connections instead of levi - civita connections , in this situation background spacetime admits non - zero torsion and zero curvature .",
    "this definition of spacetime was introduced by einstein to define gravitation in terms of torsion and tetrad . in tegr ,",
    "tetrad field plays the role of dynamical field instead of metric field .",
    "inspite of such differences tegr and gr have many similarities , in other words every solution of gr is also solution of tegr .",
    "but when tegr is generalized to @xmath0 gravity theory , by assuming the lagrangian as a general function of torsion scalar , the equivalence between these tow theories breaks down @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath0 theory can be considered as a prominent candidate for the explanation of the accelerated expansion of universe in the absence of dark energy @xcite .    in @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "equations of motions are second order differential equations as in gr , but in @xmath3 such equations are fourth order in metric formulism ( second order in plantini approach ) .",
    "as compared to gr , dynamical equations in @xmath0 gravity , displays the additional degree of freedom which is related to the fact that equations of motions are invariant under the lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been proposed that there are two types tetrad , bad and good . the diagonal and non - diapasonal tetrad are known as bad and good tetrad , respectively .",
    "the non - diagonal tetrad are used to properly parallelize the isotropic spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "no doubt @xmath0 theory is excellent theory for the explanation of cosmic acceleration and observations on large scale(clustering of galaxies ) @xcite .",
    "but we must remember that gr is in excellent agreement in with solar system test and pulsar observation @xcite . in recent papers",
    "@xcite , some solar system constraints have been proposed for the @xmath0 gravity in the diagonal tetrad case .",
    "but in the present paper , we adopt the non - diagonal tetrad to drive the models of anisotropic compact stars in @xmath0 , gravity by assuming the power law form of @xmath0 model .    in theoretical astrophysics ,",
    "@xmath0 theory was used to explore the effects of @xmath0 models in 3dimensions , so that @xmath0 version of btz black hole solutions has been formulated @xcite .",
    "later on @xcite , it has been proved that the violation of first of black hole thermodynamics in @xmath0 gravity , is due to the violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "recently @xcite , some static spherically symmetric solutions with charged source have been found in @xmath0 theory . after finding a large class of static perfect fluid solutions @xcite , the physical conditions for the existence of astrophysical stars in @xmath0 theory",
    "have been discussed @xcite .",
    "recently , abbas and his collaborators have studied the models of anisotropic compact stars in gr , @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 theories in diagonal tetrad case @xcite-@xcite . the main objective of this paper is to study the symmetric models of the anisotropic compact stars in the context of @xmath0 gravity using non - diagonal tetrad .",
    "we investigate the anisotropic the anisotropic behavior , regularity as well as stability of these models .",
    "finally , the surface redshift has been calculated .",
