    "the phenomenon of persistent current was first established during @xmath3 s when bttiker and his group have shown  @xcite that a small conducting ring carries a net circular current in presence of an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux @xmath0 , and it does not vanish even in presence of disorder .",
    "this is a pure quantum mechanical phase coherence phenomenon and a direct consequence of ab effect  @xcite .    the experimental verification of it came after few years when levy and co - workers did the pioneering experiment  @xcite considering an ensemble of @xmath4 independent cu rings .",
    "later several other experiments  @xcite were carried out to confirm the existence of persistent current in different conducting loops . at the same time a substantial amount of theoretical work  @xcite has also revealed several unique features along this direction . from the single ring measurement  @xcite a period of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , the elementary flux - quantum )",
    "current has been observed , while some other experiments  @xcite have shown both @xmath7 and @xmath5 periodic currents .",
    "this half flux - quantum ( @xmath7 ) periodic persistent current is not well explained from theoretical calculations and certainly it demands proper analysis .",
    "the another confliction between theoretical and experimental results is associated with the prediction of low - field currents , viz , slope of the current with flux @xmath0 in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "some experiments  @xcite have shown diamagnetic ( negative slope ) nature , while paramagnetic ( positive slope ) response has been noticed from other experiments  @xcite . these observations do not really match well with theoretical observations .",
    "many attempts have been made along this line and it has been observed that  @xcite the slope strongly depends on electronic filling , randomness , impurities , etc .    finally , the most important controversy has been raised during the prediction of current amplitude .",
    "only for nearly ballistic rings comparable currents are obtained , while for diffusive rings the calculated current is much smaller and in some cases it is even less than two orders of magnitude compared to the experimental observations . in order to resolve this long - standing anomaly in diffusive rings , several attempts have been made considering the effects of different parameters .",
    "it has been verified that on - site coulomb correlation plays a dominant role  @xcite to enhance current amplitude in a disordered ring , though the enhancement is not sufficient to make it comparable to experimental observations .",
    "later few theoretical models have been given considering the effect of higher order hopping integrals  @xcite in addition to the usual nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) in favor of current enhancement upto a certain level .",
    "so naturally the question comes how the current becomes affected if one includes the effect of both on - site coulomb interaction and long - range hopping .",
    "this part has not been discussed so far , to the best of our knowledge .    in the present work",
    "we actually focus towards this direction . here",
    "we consider interacting rings with higher - order hopping integrals and determine energy eigenvalues by _ exact numerical diagonalization _ of many - body tight - binding hamiltonian . in this method",
    "we restrict ourselves to rings with few number of electrons , because of our computational limitations , as dimension of the matrix raises rapidly with ring size @xmath9 and total number of electrons @xmath10 .",
    "different combinations of up and down spin electrons are taken into account and from our results we observe some similarities in current - flux characteristics for odd @xmath10 as well as even @xmath10 , which certainly help us to generalize the results for larger ring size with higher electrons .",
    "however , it is always good to have some definite results of large interacting rings to understand the interplay between long - range hopping , disorder and e - e interaction .",
    "we thus require an appropriate technique to work out such a many - body problem .",
    "here we use hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field theory  @xcite to find energy eigenvalues and hence persistent currents , and , compare these currents with exact exact numerical diagonalization analysis . scrutinizing the results we show that persistent current behaves almost identical in these two methods , but one can miss some important signatures of current at some typical fluxes , particularly in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "this is an artifact of the mean - field calculations .",
    "several interesting features are obtained from our calculations .",
    "the current gets enhanced in a disordered ring as a result of coulomb repulsion and it becomes more effective when higher order hopping integrals are included .",
    "under this situation current becomes quite comparable to that of a perfect ring .",
    "in addition we also discuss the appearance of half flux - quantum periodicity for some particular electron fillings and some kink - like structures at different fluxes apart from @xmath1 and @xmath2 . finally ,",
    "scaling behavior of current is also discussed , for the sake of completeness .",
    "the rest of the work is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the ring model and theoretical procedure to construct the hamiltonian matrix and calculation of persistent current as a function of flux @xmath0 .",
    "later , in sec .",

    "is determined from the relation given in eq .",
    "we present our results in two different sub - sections . in the first part ( sub - section a )",
    "we determine persistent current by evaluating ground state energy from _ exact numerical diagonalization _ of many - body hamiltonian .",

    "different combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are taken into account to explore all the basic features of persistent current in interacting rings .",

    "the current is measured in unit of @xmath46 .",
    "let us first concentrate on interacting rings without any impurity i.e. , @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "0.25 cm * case 1 - ring with two electrons : * to have an interacting ring with two electrons we consider one up and one down spin electron i.e. , @xmath32 . for this configuration we select basis states as @xmath49 and @xmath50 and",
    "the dimension of matrix becomes @xmath51 for a @xmath9-site ring .",

    "this behavior is nicely reflected in current - flux characteristics yielding a kink - like structure .",
    "a sudden change in direction of current takes place as a result of this kink , and interestingly we see that inside a kink the slope of the current remains unchanged irrespective of @xmath23 .",
    "( ii ) for a fixed correlation strength @xmath23 , the slope of @xmath56-@xmath0 curve gets increased with higher order hopping which results a larger current . here",
    "it is important to note that though tnh strength is much weaker than    snh , it contributes significantly to raise the current which is visible from the spectra given in figs .",
    "[ f2](d ) and ( f ) .",
    "certainly , more current is expected in presence of additional higher order hopping , beyond tnh , though their strengths are vanishingly small .",
    "physically this is easily understandable since the incorporation of additional hopping allows electrons to hop further and thereby increases electronic current .",
    "( iii ) a reduction of current is observed with increasing @xmath23 when all the other physical parameters describing the system remain unchanged .",
    "this is solely due to the repulsive nature of electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction .",
    "it suggests that lesser and lesser current is expected with increasing @xmath23 , though it eventually reaches to a finite value ( not shown here ) and never drops to zero since @xmath57 , which we verify through our detailed numerical analysis .    to have a deeper insight about the role of snh and tnh integrals in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we present the variation of ground state energy along with persistent current as a function of @xmath0 considering @xmath58 for the same ring size as taken in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for some typical values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . from the spectra given in @xmath53st row",
    "we see that with increasing @xmath19 current gets enhanced    following energy - flux diagram but it ( @xmath19 ) reduces the kink size .",
    "further enhancement of current can be also made possible with the inclusion of tnh ( see fig .  [ f3](d ) ) , and like @xmath19 , @xmath20 is also responsible for the reduction of kink size , though these kinks do not vanish even for larger @xmath19 and @xmath20 as long as e - e interaction is there .",
    "for this two - spin system we get only @xmath5 periodic current .",
    "0.25 cm * case 2 - ring with three electrons : * now we consider a ring with one down spin and two up spin electrons to have a three - electron ring system , and here we choose @xmath59 and @xmath60 . with this configuration",
    "the dimension of the matrix for a @xmath9-site ring becomes : @xmath61 .",
    "two different cases are analyzed depending on the filling factor those are as follows .",
    "0.25 cm @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we present the variation of ground state energy @xmath56 and its corresponding persistent    current as a function of ab flux @xmath0 in the half - filled limit for three typical values of @xmath23 .",
    "two important features are observed .",
    "( i ) ground state energy exhibits half - flux - quantum ( @xmath7 ) periodicity with @xmath0 , and it is nicely reflected in the current - flux characteristics . to illustrate this fact we can set the interaction strength @xmath23 to zero , since it does not affect @xmath7 periodicity ( which is shown from the @xmath56-@xmath0 and @xmath63-@xmath0 spectra ) . due to this simplification we can    handle the problem very easily as it becomes now a non - interacting one . for @xmath64 , three energy eigenstates are obtained where each of these states can have maximum two opposite spin electrons .",
    "therefore , ground state energy is obtained by placing two opposite spin electrons in the lowest non - interacting energy level and the third electron ( up spin ) in the first excited level .",
    "quite interestingly , we observe that all such distinct energy levels have @xmath5 flux - quantum periodicity . but",

    ", instead of two , the net ground state energy of the system gets strange @xmath7 periodicity .",
    "this peculiar @xmath7 periodicity also remains unchanged even in presence of @xmath23 , which we claim from our results .",
    "( ii ) no kink - like structure appears in @xmath63-@xmath0 curves which implies that at half - filling no @xmath23-independent state contributes to the lowest energy for any flux window .    for such filling , current decreases rapidly with the correlation strength @xmath23 , as there is no empty site .",

    "[ f5 ] which exhibit some interesting patterns unlike the half - filled case .",

    "( ii ) the kink - like structure , associated with @xmath23-independent states , appears in persistent current across @xmath1 at sufficiently large value of @xmath23 , and the width of such kink decreases with the inclusion of higher order hopping integrals like snh and tnh . in this context",
    "it is important to note that for two - electron case , kink appears as long as the interaction is turned on .",
    "the other features viz , the reduction of current with @xmath23 and its enhancement with higher order hopping integrals remain same as discussed in a two - electron ring system .    0.25 cm *",

    "away from half - filling some kink - like structures are visible in @xmath63-@xmath0 spectra reflecting the @xmath56-@xmath0 curves , and the most crucial point is that these kinks are generated as a result of @xmath23-dependent states , not like @xmath23-independent states as described earlier .",

    "but there is a crucial difference between these two sets of electronic configurations . comparing the current spectra given in figs .",
    "[ f6](b ) and [ f8](b ) it is seen that the suppression of current due to e - e interaction becomes more significant for the ring with @xmath66 and @xmath67 compared to the other case .",
    "the reason is that in the first case where @xmath81 , the hopping probability of up spin electrons is less compared to the ring with @xmath82 since in the later case pairing of up and down spin electrons in a single site is possible as a result of hopping term for    low @xmath23 , yielding a contribution to the current . for large @xmath23 in both these two cases",

    "the available current for the disordered ring in presence of higher order hopping integrals is quite comparable to the current obtained for a _ perfect _ non - interacting ring described with only nnh integral which , on the other hand , is very close to the experimental observations .",
    "therefore , only nnh model is _ not sufficient _ to verify experimental results where the rings invariably contain disorder and certainly we have to go beyond nnh model .",
    "apart from this we also find that sudden phase reversal of current takes place around @xmath55 due to @xmath23-independent states , like the two - electron ordered ring , but for this disordered case the kink appears beyond a critical value of @xmath23 ( @xmath103 , say ) and it depends on ring size as well as disorder strength . whereas , any non - zero value of @xmath23 yields kink - like structure in the ordered ring .",

    "figure  [ scl1 ] displays the dependence of current ( @xmath104 ) as a function of @xmath9 considering @xmath58 and @xmath105 ( @xmath32 ) , where    @xmath104 is obtained by taking the maximum absolute value of current computed within the flux range @xmath106 to @xmath5 .",

    "the dotted points , corresponding to current for different @xmath9 , are computed following the exact diagonalization method , and , using these dots we construct a scaling behavior of current which generates the continuous line .",

    "our analysis clearly suggests that the current decreases algebraically with ring size @xmath9 .",
    "in this sub - section we present numerical results computed from hf mean - field approach and compare these results with those obtained from the other method i.e. , exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "figure  [ mf1 ] displays the dependence of ground state energy together with persistent current as a function of flux @xmath0 for some typical ordered rings ( even @xmath9 ) described with only nnh integral in the limit of half - filling considering different values of electronic correlation strength @xmath23 .",

    "[ mf1 ] we present the mf results for a @xmath123-site ring , and they exhibit almost identical features , like a @xmath124-site ring , which yield the invariant nature of energy- and current - flux characteristics for different ring sizes when the filling factor remains constant .    in a similar way we now focus our attention on the rings with odd @xmath9 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mf2 ] where we present the behavior of ground state energy and corresponding persistent current , obtained from mf technique , for two different ring sizes .",
    "the spectra for @xmath125 ( first row of fig .",

    "quite interestingly we see that almost all the features , viz , suppression of current with @xmath23 and half flux - quantum periodicity as a function of @xmath0 remain unchanged .",
    "but , for narrow regions of @xmath0 the slope of the currents for non - zero @xmath23 shows opposite signature in these two different numerical methods , while it ( slope ) remains    same for other flux regions .",
    "this is the peculiarity of mf calculations and can be noticed for any other ordered rings with odd @xmath9 in the limit of half - filling . to substantiate it in the second row of fig .",
    "[ mf2 ] we present the results for a @xmath126-site ring considering @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and see that all the properties exhibited by a @xmath129-site ring are nicely followed in this bigger ring .",

    "[ mf3 ] where we present the variation of persistent current for a @xmath130-site ring as a function of @xmath0 considering two different band fillings those are placed in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "four distinct cases are analyzed depending on the physical parameters of the system .",
    "the red curve corresponds to the current for the non - interacting ( @xmath73 ) disordered ( @xmath102 ) ring described with only nnh integral . while introducing the effect of e - e interaction in this ring we get cyan curve .",
    "the green line represents the current for the ring with disorder , e - e interaction and snh integral , whereas incorporating further the effect of tnh integral in this ring we get the current shown by the purple curve . at half - filling all the currents are quite comparable with each other ( fig .  [ mf3](a ) ) and higher order hopping integrals do not actually play any such significant role in enhancing the current since it is counterbalanced by the repulsive coulomb interaction . on the other hand , at less than half - filling an enhancement of current takes place as a result of @xmath23 and it becomes more significant in presence of higher order hopping integrals ( fig .",
    "[ mf3](b ) ) as there exists empty sites where electrons can hop quite easily yielding more current .",
    "these mean - field results are fully consistent with our exact numerical diagonalization analysis ( see figs .",
    "[ f19 ] and [ f20 ] ) .",
    "to conclude , in this work we have investigated the behavior of ground state energy and persistent current in interacting mesoscopic rings subjected to ab flux @xmath0 in presence of long - range hopping and disorder .",
    "two different methods , exact numerical diagonalization and hf mean - field theory , have been used to compute numerical results of the many - body systems , and , found that the results obtained from these two methods are highly consistent with each other .",
    "the interplay between hubbard interaction and long - range hopping integrals yields a significant enhancement of persistent current in disordered ring which in some cases becomes comparable to that of an ordered ring and reaches very close to the experimental observations .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that only e - e interaction is not sufficient to explain the enhancement of persistent current in a disordered ring described with nnh integral .",
    "we have to incorporate the effect of higher order hopping integrals . from our results",
    "we have shown that even for too small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 compared to @xmath16 , current gets enhanced significantly .",
    "in addition , we have also discussed the appearance of @xmath7 periodic current for some typical electron fillings and its sensitivity on higher order hopping as well as randomness .",
