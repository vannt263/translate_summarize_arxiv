    "2005 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "because of the high column density , gas in dlas should be mainly neutral under the illumination of background radiation from quasars and galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 1996 ) .",
    "dlas are usually considered as the main neutral gas reservoir for star formation in the high redshift universe ( e.g. nagamine , springel & hernquist 2004 ; prochaska , herbert - fort & wolfe 2005 ) .    for a quasar at a redshift @xmath11 ,",

    "the observed @xmath19 can be crudely described either by a @xmath20 function ( fall & pei 1993 ; proux et al .",
    "2003 ) or by a double power - law with a break at @xmath21 ( prochaska & wolfe 2009 ; noterdaeme et al . 2009 ) .",
    "although great efforts have been made to measure the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath13 , and frequency distribution , @xmath19 , of dlas , the slope at the high @xmath13 end is not well constrained by observations .",
    "the slope varies from @xmath22 ( prochaska & wolfe 2009 ) to @xmath23 ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ) , unlike the stable measurement of slope at the low @xmath13 end , @xmath24 ( proux et al .",
    "2005 ; prochaska & wolfe 2009 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "such a disagreement is likely originated from the large statistical fluctuation caused by the rare detections of high @xmath13 dlas . since the mean co - moving h  i density",

    "it is quite desirable to measure more high column density dlas to determine the shape of @xmath19 at the high @xmath13 end correctly .",
    "so far , only two super - dlas with @xmath26 have been identified , sdss j081634.40@xmath27144612.9 ( hereafter j0816@xmath271446 ; noterdaeme et al . 2009 ; guimares et al . 2012 ) and sdss j113520.39@xmath28001052.5 ( hereafter j1135@xmath280010 ; kulkarni et al .",

    "dusty absorbers are detected frequently in other astrophysical environments . in the mw ,",

    ", many very dusty absorbers have been detected by observations of grb afterglow ( e.g. schady et al .",
    "fall & pei ( 1993 ) developed an analytical model to study the selection effect due to the obscuration of dust in dlas and suggested that a fairly large fraction of dusty dlas has been overlooked in the quasar surveys .",
    "the full obscuration model requires a luminosity function of quasars , a distribution of dust - to - gas ratio and a distribution of @xmath13 in dlas .",
    "the application of the obscuration model is presented in  5 .",
    "star formation leads to consumption of neutral gas and enrichment of heavy elements .",
    "the measurements of average metallicity at different redshifts provide robust diagnosis for cosmic star formation .",
    "the dla technique could be a powerful tool to probe the metals in the high redshift universe . however , current measurements suggest that dlas are generally metal - poor .",
    "the mean metallicity is only a few percents of the solar abundance ( e.g. , kulkarni & fall 2002 ; prochaska et al . 2003 ; kaplan et al . 2010 ) .",
    "it is significantly lower than the metallicity measured in the mw and the nearby galaxies as well as the high redshift galaxies selected through their starlight emissions , such as lyman break galaxies ( e.g. , giavalisco 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "since dust grains are made of heavy elements , the correlation between metallicity and dust abundance is expected ( e.g. , xiao et al .",
    "therefore , a direct explanation for the deficiency of heavy elements in dlas is that the metal - rich absorbers suffer relatively large dust obscuration and thus are systematically omitted in the dla surveys ( e.g. , boiss et al .",
