    "the so called ernst solution is free of conical singularities at both poles and the acceleration that drives away the two oppositely charged reissner - nordstrm black holes is totally provided by the external electromagnetic field . in the ds background",
    "we can not remove the conical singularities through the application of the harrison transformation @xcite .",

    "in a previous paper @xcite we have analyzed in detail the physical interpretation and properties of the anti - de sitter c - metric . in the ds background , podolsk and griffiths @xcite have established that the ds c - metric found by plebaski and demiaski @xcite describes a pair of accelerated black holes with the acceleration being provided by a strut that connects the black holes together with the cosmological constant .",
    "we have extended their analysis essentially by drawing the carter - penrose diagrams of the solutions .",
    "these diagrams allowed us to clearly identify the presence of two ds black holes and to conclude that they can not interact gravitationally . to obtain the physical interpretation of the solutions we have followed the approach of kinnersly and walker @xcite for the flat c - metric .",
    "the alternative approach of bonnor @xcite which puts the flat c - metric into the weyl form can not be realized here , since the introduction of the cosmological constant prevents such a coordinate transformation .",
    "the embedding of the massless uncharged ds",

    "is represented by two hyperbolic lines that approach asymptotically the rindler - like accelerated horizon .",
    "this acceleration horizon coincides with the cosmological horizon of the ds solution that is already present in the @xmath117 solution .",
    "so , the presence of the extra acceleration caused by the strut does not introduce an extra horizon , contrary to what occurs in the the @xmath114 c - metric @xcite and in the @xmath115 c - metric @xcite .",
    "however , in the @xmath117 ds solution the cosmological horizon has the topology of a round sphere , while in the ds c - metric ( @xmath118 ) the presence of the acceleration induces a non - spherical shape in the acceleration ( cosmological ) horizon .",
    "when we add a mass or a charge to the system the causal diagrams indicate that now we have two ds - schwarzschild or two ds@xmath184reissner - nordstrm black holes approaching asymptotically the rindler - like accelerated horizon .",
    "the topology of all the horizons of these solutions is compact but non - spherical . in @xcite",
    "the authors stated that since the origin of the massless uncharged ds c - metric corresponds to two accelerating points in de ds background then , when the mass and charge are small , the ds c - metric can be regarded as a perturbation of the massless uncharged ds c - metric .",
    "in this way they concluded that the ds c - metric describes a pair of accelerating black holes . with the carter - penrose diagrams of the massive and charged solutions ,",
    "we have confirmed this result and we have found the range of parameters @xmath161 , and @xmath11 that correspond to non - extreme black holes , extreme black holes , and naked particles .",
    "the general features of the carter - penrose diagram of the ds c - metric are independent of the angular coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "this sets a great difference between the causal diagrams of the ds c - metric and the ones of the @xmath114 case @xcite and of the @xmath115 case @xcite . indeed , for the @xmath243 c - metric",
    ", the carter - penrose diagram at the north pole direction is substantially different from the one along the south pole direction and different from the diagram along the equator direction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have proceeded to the localization of the conical singularity present in the solution .",
    "we have clearly identified the black hole north pole direction and shown that it points towards the other black hole .",
    "when the conical singularity is at the north pole , it is associated to a strut between the two black holes which satisfies the relation @xmath237 , where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are respectively the pressure on the strut and its mass density .",
    "the pressure is positive , so it points outwards and pulls the black holes apart , furnishing their acceleration ( as in the flat and ads c - metric ) .",
    "when the conical singularity is at the south pole , it is associated to a string between the two black holes with negative pressure that pushes the black holes away from each other .",
    "the analysis of the carter - penrose diagrams of the ds c - metric has also been important to conclude that the two black holes can not interact gravitationally .",
    "for example , looking into fig .",
    "[ fig-2].(i ) which represents the non - extreme massive uncharged c - metric we conclude that a null ray sent from the vicinity of one of the black holes can never cross the acceleration horizon ( @xmath83 ) into the other black hole .",
    "indeed , recall that in these diagrams the vertical axes represents the time flow and that light rays move along @xmath244 lines .",
    "thus , a light ray that is emitted from a region next to the horizon @xmath140 of the left black hole of fig .",
    "[ fig-2].(i ) can pass through the acceleration horizon @xmath83 and ,",
    "once it has done this , we will necessarily proceed into infinity @xmath245 .",
    "this light ray can not enter the right region of fig . [",
    "fig-2].(i ) and , in particular , it can not hit the horizon @xmath140 of the right black hole .",
    "so , if the two black holes can not communicate through a null ray they can not interact gravitationally .",
    "the black holes accelerate away from each other only due to the pressure of the strut that connects the two black holes , in addition to the cosmological background acceleration contribution .",
    "this is coherent with the fact that there is no particular value of @xmath3 and @xmath0 for which the solution describes two black holes in a ds background whose relative distance remains fixed . indeed ,",
    "if the black holes could interact gravitationally then there would exist a particular set of parameter values for which the outward repulsion produced by the strut and by the cosmological constant would exactly cancel the inward gravitational attraction , and the two black holes would be in equilibrium in the ds background .",
    "this is not the case precisely because the two black holes do not interact gravitationally .",
    "note that the ds - schwarzschild solution ( @xmath117 ) and the ds@xmath184reissner - nordstrm solution ( @xmath117 ) can be interpreted as a pair of gravitationally non - interacting black holes at antipodal points on the spatial 3-sphere of the ds space , which are accelerating away from each other due to the cosmological background acceleration .",
    "similarly the massive and/or charged ds c - metric ( @xmath118 ) also describes a pair of gravitationally non - interacting black holes that accelerate away from each other in a ds background , but now they suffer an extra acceleration @xmath0 provided by the strut or by the string that connects them .",

    "<S> following the work of kinnersley and walker for flat spacetimes , we have analyzed the anti - de sitter c - metric in a previous paper . in the de sitter case , podolsk and griffiths </S>",
    "<S> have established that the de sitter c - metric ( ds c - metric ) found by plebaski and demiaski describes a pair of accelerated black holes in the ds background with the acceleration being provided ( in addition to the cosmological constant ) by a strut that pushes away the two black holes or , alternatively , by a string that pulls them . </S>",
    "<S> we extend their analysis mainly in four directions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we draw the carter - penrose diagrams of the massless uncharged ds c - metric , of the massive uncharged ds c - metric and of the massive charged ds c - metric . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams allow us to clearly identify the presence of two ds black holes and to conclude that they can not interact gravitationally . </S>",
    "<S> second , we revisit the embedding of the ds c - metric in the 5d minkowski spacetime and we represent the motion of the ds c - metric origin in the ds 4-hyperboloid as well as the localization of the strut . </S>",
    "<S> third , we comment on the physical properties of the strut that connects the two black holes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find the range of parameters that correspond to non - extreme black holes , extreme black holes , and naked particles . </S>"
