    "superfluids respond to rapid rotation by forming triangular arrays of singly quantized vortex lines . compared with superfluid @xmath0he,@xcite",
    "the properties of vortices in bose - einstein condensed atomic gases have proven to be considerably more accessible . following the creation of single vortex lines in atomic condensates by phase imprinting,@xcite large arrays",
    "have been created via mechanical rotation , by stirring the condensate with a laser beam,@xcite and by particle evaporation.@xcite upwards of 300 vortex lines have been created in rapidly rotating condensates , and properties such as the modes of the lattice@xcite and vortex core structure@xcite have been studied in detail .",
    "the superfluid velocity , @xmath1 , obeys the quantization condition , @xmath2 , where the line integral is along a closed contour surrounding @xmath3 singly quantized vortices , @xmath4 is planck s constant , and @xmath5 the particle mass . in the neighborhood of a single line ,",
    "the velocity is in the azimuthal direction and has magnitude @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance from the line .",
    "a system containing many vortex lines appears to rotate uniformly with an average angular velocity @xmath8 , which is simply related to the ( two - dimensional ) density of vortex lines , @xmath9 , by the quantization condition : @xmath10 .",
    "as the system rotates more and more rapidly , the lines become closer and closer .",
    "the question i would like to discuss here is what eventually happens to the vortex array . in other words , how does a rapidly rotating bose condensate carry large quantities of angular momentum per particle ?",
    "one may be tempted to argue by analogy with a type ii superconductor which in the presence of a magnetic field above a critical value , @xmath11 , contains an array of vortex lines with quantized flux .",
    "as the field is increased the line density grows until the cores begin to overlap , at a critical field , @xmath12 , at which point the system turns normal .",
    "however , a low temperature rotating bosonic system _ does not _ have a normal phase to which it can return.@xcite unlike in a weakly interacting superconductor , where condensation occurs as a small dynamical decoration on top of a normal state , bose condensation occurs kinematically .",
    "a bose system must respond differently than a type ii superconductor . in he",
    "ii , the question has never been of experimental interest , since the intervortex spacings are typically macroscopic , while the core sizes are of order ngstroms , and thus the critical rotation rate , @xmath13 , at which the vortex cores would approach each other is unobservably large , @xmath14 rad / sec.@xcite in a weakly interacting atomic condensate , the radius of a single vortex core is of order @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the s - wave scattering length , and @xmath17 is the particle density . typically , @xmath18 @xmath19 m , so that cores would begin to touch at @xmath20 rad / sec , an experimentally accessible rate .",
    "the ground state of the system rotating at angular frequency @xmath8 about the @xmath21 axis is determined by minimizing the energy in the rotating frame , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the component of the angular momentum of the system along the rotation axis : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the condensate wave function , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the trapping potential , and @xmath28 determines the strength of the interparticle interaction .",
    "the fate of a rapidly rotating bose system depends on how the system is confined . in typical condensate experiments",
    "the system , rotating about the @xmath21 axis , is confined in a harmonic trap of the form , @xmath29 in this case the centrifugal potential , @xmath30 , tends to cancel the transverse trapping potential , and the system can not rotate faster than @xmath31 without becoming untrapped . as @xmath32 ,",
    "the system flattens out , becomes almost two dimensional , and eventually enters quantum hall - like states . on the other hand , in the presence of an anharmonic",
    "transverse trapping potential that grows faster than quadratic , e.g. , @xmath33 the system can rotate faster than @xmath31 , since it is contained by the anharmonic part of the potential .",
    "in fact there is never a phase transition associated with the vortex cores overlapping in a rotating bose condensate . rather , as the intervortex spacing becomes comparable to the mean field coherence length , @xmath34",
    ", the vortex cores begin to shrink , and eventually the core radius scales down with the intervortex spacing .    . adapted from ref .",
    ".,height=240 ]    in ref .  , and more fully in ref .  , we approached the problem by treating the core radius , @xmath35 , as a variational parameter . by integrating out the short range structure on scales of the vortex separation ,",
    "one derives an effective hamiltonian , @xmath36 , \\label{erot } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the smoothed density ; the parameter @xmath38 takes into account the local vortex kinetic energy , including the curvature of the order parameter , and @xmath39 describes the renormalization the coupling constant , @xmath40 , due to density fluctuations about the smoothed density within each vortex cell .",
    "the core size is determined by minimizing eq .",
    "( [ erot ] ) with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "figure 1a shows the resultant mean square area of the vortex core , in a harmonic trap , measured in units of the area per vortex line , for the qualitatively accurate model in which the condensate wave function has the form @xmath41 , for @xmath42 , and constant for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the radius of the ( cylindrical ) wigner - seitz cell around a given vortex : @xmath45 . in this model ,",
    "the mean square core area divided by the area per vortex , @xmath46 , is @xmath47 . the horizontal axis in fig .",
    "1 is the rotational rapidity,@xcite @xmath48 , defined by @xmath49 , a convenient variable for spreading out the region where @xmath50 .",
    "the linear rise at small @xmath8 occurs because the core size remains constant , while @xmath51 decreases linearly with @xmath52 .",
    "the flattening of @xmath46 with increasing @xmath8 is a consequence of the vortex radius scaling with the intervortex spacing .",
    "the upper line shows the exact limit as @xmath53 .",
    "recent jila measurements@xcite of @xmath46 ( as a function of @xmath54 ) , fig .",
    "1b , nicely show the expected initial linear rise , followed by the predicted scaling of the core radius with intervortex spacing .",
    "as the rotation rate in a harmonic trap approaches @xmath31 , the centrifugal potential basically cancels the transverse trapping potential ; the cloud flattens out , and becomes a effectively two dimensional system . because the density @xmath17 of the system drops , the interaction terms @xmath55 , become small compared with @xmath56 , then , as one sees from eq .",
    "( [ eprime ] ) with ( [ harmonic ] ) , the dynamics is that of a particle feeling the coriolis force alone , a system formally analogous to a particle in a magnetic field .",
    "ho@xcite predicted that in this limit particles should condense into the lowest landau level ( lll ) in the coriolis force , similar to charged particles in the quantum hall regime .",
    "when @xmath57 , the states in the next higher landau level are separated by a gap @xmath58 . this insight has led to extensive experimental studies in which rotation rates in excess of 0.99 @xmath59 have been achieved.@xcite    the single particle wave functions in the lowest landau level have the form , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and the transverse oscillator length , @xmath63 , is given by @xmath64 .",
    "the lll condensate wave function is a linear superposition of such states : @xmath65 where the polynomial @xmath66 is written as a product over its zeroes , @xmath67 , which are simply the positions of the vortices in the condensate .",
    "the state ( [ lll ] ) in the regime @xmath68 is a direct continuation of the state in the slowly rotating regime , @xmath69 .",
    "as long as the total number of vortices is much larger than unity , the energy of the cloud in the lll limit is given by@xcite @xmath70 plus terms involving the trapping potential in the @xmath21 direction . here",
    "@xmath71 is the smoothed density profile , @xmath72 ; the brackets denote the long wavelength smoothing .",
    "the energy ( [ k2 ] ) is minimized when the cloud assumes a density profile of the thomas - fermi form,@xcite @xmath73  an inverted parabola  where @xmath74 is the transverse radius of the cloud .",
    "for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the axial oscillator length , the structure in the radial direction will be thomas - fermi at large @xmath8 , even if it is gaussian at small @xmath8.@xcite in experiment,@xcite the density profile indeed remains an inverted parabola as @xmath77 .",
    "since the energy ( [ k2 ] ) depends only on the smoothed density , the vortices must adjust their locations in order that the smoothed density be an inverted parabola . from the arguments in ref .",
    ", we find the relation between the smoothed density and the mean vortex density , @xmath78 , @xmath79 for a gaussian density profile , the vortex density is constant .",
    "however , for a thomas - fermi profile , @xmath80 since the second term is of order @xmath81 compared with the first , the density of the vortex lattice is basically uniform ( and the vortex array forms an almost perfect triangular lattice ) .",
    "turning the argument around , very small distortions of the vortex lattice from triangular can result in large changes in the density distribution.@xcite recent measurements of the ( percent scale ) distortions of the vortex lattice at relatively low rotation rates,@xcite are in good agreement with theory .",
    "the collective modes of the vortex lattice in a rotating superfluid have been of considerable interest since the 1960 s , when tkachenko@xcite showed that the lattice supports an elliptically polarized mode , a mode observed in helium in 1982.@xcite to describe the tkachenko modes , ref .   reformulated the hydrodynamics of rotating superfluids to take into account the elasticity of the vortex lattice ( including normal fluid , dissipation , and line bending  kelvin  oscillations of the vortex lines in three dimensions ) ; effects of the oscillations of the vortex lines at finite temperature on the long range phase correlations of the superfluid were discussed in ref .  .",
    "in superfluid helium , where @xmath8 is always much smaller than characteristic phonon frequencies , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the sound velocity and @xmath74 the transverse size , the modes frequencies are linear in the wave vector , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , the shear modulus , equals @xmath86 .",
    "however , in bose condensates it is possible to go to the rapidly rotating regime@xcite where @xmath87 . for general @xmath8",
    ", the in - plane tkachenko mode frequencies are given by,@xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the compressional modulus of the vortex lattice .",
    "note that at low @xmath90 , the mode frequency becomes @xmath91 .",
    "in addition the system supports a gapped sound mode of frequency , @xmath92 figure  2a shows the frequencies as a function of k , while fig .",
    "2b shows the lowest mode frequency ( of wave vector@xcite @xmath93 ) evaluated for a trapped rotating @xmath94rb gas of @xmath95 particles.@xcite in experiment,@xcite the particle number varies from run to run ; here we have multiplied the experimental frequencies by a factor @xmath96 to compare with theory , calculated for @xmath95 .",
    "as one approaches the lll regime , the shear modulus decreases to@xcite @xmath97 ; the tkachenko modes are then softer by a factor @xmath98 ; see solid curve in fig .",
    "this softening of the modes has recently been measured,@xcite and is in good agreement with theory .    .",
    "( b ) frequency of the lowest tkachenko mode , with the mean sound velocity , a decreasing shear modulus , @xmath85 ( solid curve ) and a constant @xmath85 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the data ( triangles ) are from ref .  .",
    "the inset shows @xmath99 over the entire range of @xmath8 , at constant @xmath85.,height=158 ]    the softness of the tkachenko modes in the rapidly rotating regime leads to infrared singular behavior in the vortex transverse displacement - displacement correlations at finite temperature , and in the order parameter phase correlations even at zero temperature.@xcite the zero point oscillations of the vortices cause quantum melting of the lattice when @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the total number of vortices present.@xcite in a finite system the single particle density matrix , @xmath102 , falls algebraically as @xmath103 , where@xcite @xmath104 .",
    "dephasing of the condensate becomes significant only as @xmath105 , and not necessarily before the vortex lattice melts .",
    "however , in three dimensions , the tkachenko mode frequency at long wavelengths becomes linear in the wavevector for any propagation direction out of the transverse plane.@xcite at zero temperature the vortex displacement correlations are convergent at large separation , but at finite temperatures , they grow with separation .",
    "the growth of the vortex displacements should lead to observable melting of vortex lattices at higher temperatures and somewhat lower particle number and faster rotation than in current experiments . at zero temperature a system of large extent in the axial direction",
    "maintains long range order - parameter correlations for large separation , but at finite temperatures the correlations decay with separation.@xcite",
    "at sufficiently high rotation , the vortex lattice should melt and become a vortex liquid .",
    "the regime just beyond melting has yet to be described in detail . at still higher rotation speeds ,",
    "as seen in numerical simulations with a limited number of particles , the system begins to enter a sequence of highly correlated incompressible fractional quantum hall - like states.@xcite for example , at angular momentum @xmath106 , where @xmath101 ( measured in terms of the total circulation , @xmath107 ) equals @xmath108 , the exact ground state is an @xmath109-particle fully symmetric laughlin wave function ( in two dimensions ) , @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "since the wave function vanishes whenever two particles overlap , the interaction energy , @xmath112 , vanishes in this state . theoretically elucidating the states in general when the angular momentum per particle is of order the total particle number , as well as studying this regime experimentally , remain important challenges .",
    "@xmath113 plane , where @xmath114 is the height in the @xmath21 direction , showing the regions of multiply quantized vortices , of singly quantized vortices forming an array which at large number becomes a triangular lattice , and of an array of singly quantized vortices with a hole in the center.,height=144 ]",
    "the physics of a condensate confined in an anharmonic trap , e.g. , ( [ anharmonic ] ) , is quite different from that in a harmonic trap , since it becomes possible to rotate the system arbitrarily fast .",
    "as the system rotates sufficiently rapidly , the centrifugal force pushes the particles towards the edge of the trap , and a hole open up in the center .",
    "singly quantized vortex arrays with a hole have been seen in numerical simulations@xcite and discussed theoretically in refs .  .",
    "in addition , at very high rotation , systems tend to form a single multiply quantized vortex at the center , with order parameter @xmath115 , where the integer quantization index @xmath116 is @xmath117 1 .",
    "such giant vortices have been seen in numerical simulations@xcite , and are discussed theoretically in refs .  .",
