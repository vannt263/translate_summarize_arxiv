    "this remarkable point of view , which is often replaced by its time - asymmetric counterpart , was developed further by numerous authors , see the references in the monograph by chung and walsh @xcite and also wentzell @xcite .",
    "two decades after markov , bernstein @xcite introduced in the particular framework of diffusion processes the notion of _ _ reciprocal process _ _ which , by its very definition , is stable with respect to time reversal , see . during his talk at the international congress in zrich",
    ", he qualified the dynamics of reciprocal processes as _",
    "stochastiquement parfaite_. bernstein s motivation for introducing these time - symmetric notion of random process is rooted into an outstandingly insightful article by schrdinger @xcite entitled _ `` ber die umkehrung der naturgesetze '' _ published in 1931 .",
    "the particular case of gaussian reciprocal processes was extensively treated by jamison @xcite .",
    "this was also undertaken by chay @xcite who named these processes  quasi - markov random fields \" since they are random fields defined on a compact time interval .",
    "see further comments and references at the beginning of section [ sec - rpm ] and subsection [ sec : recclass ] .",
    "later , in the excellent seminal paper @xcite entitled `` reciprocal processes '' , jamison provided a rigorous definition of these processes and derived their main properties in an abstract setting .",
    "this led to many studies in specific contexts , such as diffusion processes @xcite , lvy processes @xcite or pure jump processes @xcite .",
    "this review paper revisits @xcite and provides some new results .",
    "we present a unifying measure - theoretical approach to reciprocal processes .",
    "unlike jamison s approach , which is based on the usual forward filtration , our point of view allows for a genuinely time - symmetric treatment .",
    "we look at markov and reciprocal processes as _ path measures _ , i.e.  measures on the path space .",
    "consequently , instead of considering markov and reciprocal random processes as usual , we consider markov and reciprocal path measures .",
    "theorem [ res-20 ] illustrates our perspective .",
    "its statement gives a characterization of the reciprocal measures which are dominated by a given markov measure in terms of time - symmetric versions of doob s @xmath0-transforms .",
    "we also illustrate our abstract results with several examples and counter - examples .",
    "we focus onto _ probability _ path measures . as a consequence , in the present paper we drop the word probability : any path probability measure , markov probability measure or reciprocal probability measure",
    "is simply called a path measure , a markov measure or a reciprocal measure . +",
    "our results can easily be extended to @xmath1-finite path measures , e.g.   processes admitting an unbounded measure as their initial law . for further detail about this generalized framework , see @xcite .",
