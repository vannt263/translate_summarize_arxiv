    "point - contact spectroscopy is a bulk spectroscopic probe that has been reliably used to map out bosonic and superconducting order parameter spectra via quasiparticle classical and andreev scattering , respectively .",
    "we had previously shown this technique to be exquisitely sensitive to an _ effective _ density of states specifically arising from non - fermi liquid behavior , and in the case of the iron pnictides and chalcogenides , electronic nematicity manifesting as a zero bias conductance peak corresponds to an increased effective density of states at the fermi level arising from orbital fluctuations . we have developed a quantum mechanical theory to show how this technique reveals such effective density of states , while being insensitive to gapless fermi surface reconstructions ; and is therefore a valuable filter for detecting non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "heavy fermion systems@xcite , high-@xmath2 cuprates@xcite , and very recently the iron - based superconductors@xcite all exhibit symptoms of quantum criticality .",
    "the most striking feature of quantum criticality is that the quantum fluctuations associated with the quantum critial point ( qcp ) couple strongly to itinerant electrons giving rise to drastic changes in the electronic properties .",
    "typically , such emergent properties are non - fermi liquid - like and hence fall outside the standard theory of metals . while measurements of several physical properties , for example , the heat capacity , magnetic susceptibility , and dc electrical resistivity , have been identified with nfl behavior , a direct probe of the hallmark feature of a nfl , namely the imaginary part of the single - particle self energy @xmath3 with @xmath4 , is still lacking . in principle , the temperature dependence of the dc electrical resistivity is expected to be related to @xmath5 , but it is also sensitive to many other factors , rendering such measurements inconclusive . in this context",
    "angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) is an ideal probe of this hallmark feature .",
    "however , the resolution of the arpes data is typically not high enough to pin - down @xmath5 conclusively . as a result ,",
    "a reliable experimental setup to judge whether @xmath5 is larger or smaller than 1 is one of the most important topics in this field .",
    "we demonstrate here how point contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) can be used to resolve this problem .",
    "our work here is motivated by recent pcs experiments on iron - pnictide superconductors in which an excess zero - bias conductance was measured well above the temperature associated with the structural rearrangement .",
    "based on an analogy with earlier theoretical work on nematic quantum phase transitions@xcite , lee , et al .",
    "argued that the excess zero - bias conductance measured experimentally is likely due to an excess density of states associated with fluctuations near the orbital - ordering quantum phase transition .",
    "however , a direct link between the two remains missing as there is no rigorous argument relating the pcs signal in strongly correlated systems to the single - particle density of states .",
    "the theoretical foundations for the tunneling density of states have been well established@xcite , but we stress here that pcs is not tunneling , and this work establishes a clear connection between pcs conductance and an effective density of states arising from nfl behavior .    in this paper , we build on earlier work@xcite to fill in this missing link and as a result are able to establish the circumstances under which the pcs signal is a direct measure of the single - particle density of states in strongly correlated electron systems and hence offers a window into a key probe of non - fermi liquid behavior , namely the imaginary part of the single - particle self energy .",
    "of course point - contact spectroscopy is an old field dating back to the pioneering work of i. k. yanson s @xcite in 1974 when he was attempting to measure the tunneling conductance across a superconducting / insulator / normal - metal ( sin ) planar junction . according to harrison s theorem @xcite , when the superconductor is driven normal",
    ", the resulting planar tunneling conductance must be ohmic : assuming a one - dimensional model , which holds for good planar tunnel junctions , in the standard tunneling conductance formula that assumes weakly correlated electron ( conventional ) materials , the fermi velocity @xmath6 exactly divides out the density of states @xmath7 .",
    "yanson discovered weak conductance non - linearities in an sin junction above the critical field ( s = pb ) , and that the second harmonic of the conductance @xmath8 revealed the eliashberg function , @xmath9 the strength of about @xmath10 of the background conductance .",
    "this resulted from the junctions being `` leaky '' with nanoscale metallic shorts between s and n allowing electrons to be directly injected through the junction without any tunneling processes ; hence harrison s theorem did not apply .",
    "he went on to show that when the junction is large such that the mean free path is smaller than the junction ( thermal regime ) no spectroscopic information can be obtained , but if the junction is smaller than the elastic ( sharvin or ballistic limit ) or inelastic ( diffusive regime ) mean free path , spectroscopic information is revealed .",
    "quasiparticles backscattered through the junction reveal the phonon spectrum ; so this technique is also called quasiparticle scattering spectroscopy ( qps ) .",
    "researchers in the field proceeded to map out bosonic spectra ( phonons and magnons ) in a variety of materials @xcite , quasiparticle scattering from kondo impurities @xcite , spin and charge density waves @xcite , and recently a kondo insulator@xcite . with the advent of the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk )",
    "theory@xcite , in a clean s / n junction , andreev scattering was shown to reveal details of the superconducting gap structure , including magnitude and symmetry@xcite .",
    "this technique has been shown to be particularly useful in superconductors that are difficult to grow in thin film form , e.g. , heavy - fermion superconductors @xcite and the iron - based high - temperature superconductors @xcite . in the heavy - fermions",
    ", the fano background could be accounted for via multichannel tunneling models@xcite .",
    "our focus here is on establishing a clear link between the suggestive relationship that excess zero - bias signal measured in pcs is a direct measure of the _ effective density of states _ arising from electron correlations @xcite .    to this end",
    ", we use the schwinger - kadanoff - baym - keldysh ( skbk ) formalism@xcite , coupled with certain quite reasonable assumptions , to show that the conductance measured from pcs is proportional to the _ effective _ density of states@xcite .",
    "since the effective density of states is defined as the integrated single - particle spectral function @xmath1 over the whole brillouin zone , it contains the information about the single particle self energy @xmath11 .",
    "we show that a fingerprint of non - fermi liqud behaviour with @xmath12 is an enhancement of the pcs conductance at zero bias . as a comparison",
    ", we also discuss the case of a junction in the thermal regime , in which only dc resistivity is detected .",
    "we highlight here that the dc resistivity is fundamentally different from the pcs conductance .",
    "the former is corresponding to the _ current - current _ correlation function evaluated by kubo formula , while the later is related to the single particle green function as described by the skbk formalism .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the zero - bias peak in the pcs could be identified as a unique signature of non - fermi liquid metal .",
    "we start from the ideal point - contact geometry shown in fig . [",

    "@xmath20 is the total hamiltonian for the system to be measured , containing the kinetic energy with band dispersion of @xmath21 and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 describes the transfer of electrons between the electrode and the system via point contact .    to determine the @xmath23 suitable for a realistic point - contact geometry , we first write down the corresponding term in real space as h_c = _ ,  d v^, ( ) ^_d , ( )",

    "although the exact form of @xmath26 depends on the experimental setup , a general structure for it can still be obtained . from the uncertainty principle , if the electron wave function were to be squeezed into a small area described by eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) , the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron would increase .",
    "in other words , as the electron goes through the contact , it could change momentum due to the uncertainty principle . as a result , @xmath27 is non - zero in general for @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , if the contact size were to increase ( larger uncertainty in position ) , the uncertainty in momentum would decrease .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 for @xmath28 becomes smaller and smaller as the contact size increases .",

    ", we assume that the matrix elements of electrons tunneling throughout the entire interface are the same ; that is , @xmath32 for @xmath33 . in this case , since the uncertainty in the position of the interface is infinite , the uncertainty in the in - plane momentum is zero . therefore we have @xmath34 only if the in - plane momentum is conserved ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this gives us the well - known tunneling model .    in terms of momentum conservation",
    ", pcs lies between the two extremes of stm and planar tunneling . in pcs ,",
    "the in - plane momentum is not necessarily conserved due to the quantum effects . however , if the contact size is large enough but still smaller than the electron mean - free path , @xmath27 is peaked at @xmath36 . therefore the classical scatterings , meaning scattering events conserving in - plane momentum , will be dominating . moreover ,",
    "experimentally a point contact junction is comprised of many randomly distributed short areas as demonstrated in fig . [",
    "fig : realpcs](a ) .",
    "such a configuration with many randomly distributed point contacts ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realpcs](b ) ) allows electrons pass through the junction via these different locations .",
    "this effectively increases the uncertainty in position and leads to a further suppression of matrix elements @xmath27 for @xmath37 , as long as the average distance between these point contacts are comparable to , or smaller than , the electron mean - free path .",
    "consequently , it is a valid approximation that the dominant scatterings are ballistic , and in keeping with the classical limit , we keep only that part of the transfer hamiltonian which conserves the in - plane momentum .",
    "this reduces our model to that of an effective hamiltonian containing only transfer matrix elements that conserve the in - plane momentum , which has been shown to capture the physics for pcs in the classical limit in several systems@xcite .",
    "ideal geometry of point - contact spectroscopy .",
    "electron a can transport from the metallic electrode into the system through the contact ( circle ) , thereby contributing to the current , while electron b is scattered back by the wall , resulting in no contribution to the current . ]",
    "now we briefly discuss the working principle of pcs .",
    "electrons are injected from the metallic electrode ( left ) via the point contact into the system with excess energy .",
    "this excess energy must be relaxed by inelastic scattering in the system , and the electrons must be thermalized upon reaching the electrode on the other side ( right ) , thereby contributing to the current @xmath38 that can be measured .",
    "consequently , the conductance , defined as @xmath39 , could reveal information about scattering mechanisms in the system .",
    "since the processes involving electrons relaxing excess energy are non - equilibrium in nature , we employ the standard skbk formalism to compute the current . by contrast , if the contact size is longer than the electron mean - free path , i.e. , in the thermal regime , the excess energy of the injected electrons will be consumed at the junction . in this case , the skbk formalism does not apply and one should treat it as a usual resistor using the kubo formula . as a result , in the thermal regime , pcs conductance will only be determined by the resistivity and in fact , this criterion has been used to determine the quality of the junction in ref .",

    "this deviation arises from two sources .",
    "first , our treatment is strictly valid at zero temperature . at finite temperature ,",
    "the fermi function is no longer a step function , so @xmath78 is not a delta function .",
    "therefore the convolution of the effective density of states with @xmath79 results in a broadening of the spectral function , directly resulting from thermal population effects . to account for this , eq . ( [ finali3 ] ) becomes i = d_^_- t",
    "( _ , ) a(_,ev , ) , [ kbti ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this results in a significant modification in the fitting formula , & & = \\{d(e_f + b_1 ) - + & + & } , + at finite temperature .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the experimentally observed zero - bias peak , performed at finite temperature , is broader than our theory calculated at zero temperature .",
    "second , we have made the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) that the non - fermi liquid self - energy is momentum - independent and only results from a modification of the states right at the fermi surface . in principle",
    ", the self - energy should have a smooth transition from a non - fermi liquid form to something else for states away from the fermi surface , and unfortunately no current theoretical tools can be employed to capture this effect accurately .",
    "_ addressed this problem using multidimensional bosonization@xcite , and they found a logarithmic form for the effective density of states of the form d_(_,=ev ) = d^*(e_f ) + b ^2/3 + . [ logfit ] as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , the peak is less sharp if we fit the data with eq .",
    "( [ logfit ] ) , as expected .",
    "finally , at lower temperatures , we measure a sharp dip at zero bias , which always accompanies a background conductance that strongly increases with bias , whose origin remains unclear . in summary , these details would in general increase the density of states for energies slightly away from the fermi energy , making the peak at zero bias less sharp as seen in experiments . except for the sharp dip at zero bias which we can not explain ,",
    "we conclude then that any apparent disagreement with the experimental data can be corrected by finite temperature and matrix element effects in our formalism .",
    "consequently , we conclude that a strong zero - bias peak in the pcs conductance in non - superconducting materials is a genuine feature of a non - fermi liquid system .",
    "indeed , such a feature represents the fingerprint of strong correlations . as a comparison",
    ", it is well established that pcs can detect quasiparticle scattering effects due to electron - phonon , electron - magnon , and single - impurity kondo interactions , but the feature associated with each is a small ( @xmath82 ) decrease in the background conductance .",
    "the accepted explanation for the small decrease is that , at a particular energy , the electrons are backscattered by the interactions , thereby reducing the conductance@xcite .",
    "these features have been successfully modeled using the classical non - linear boltzmann equation@xcite .",
    "the only example in which the conductance is increased is in the case of andreev reflection from superconductors .",
    "although this can produce a sub - gap conductance as high as doubling the background conductance , it is due to the unique property of particle - hole mixing of the cooper pairs@xcite , and does not apply in the non - superconducting materials modeled here .",
    "the experiments we are modeling show a large ( @xmath83 ) increase in the background conductance around zero bias in non - superconducting materials . unlike the understood effects described just above , we have modeled the quantum - mechanical non - fermi liquid behavior , resulting from strong electron correlations in which the self - energies of all the single - particle states are strongly modified .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy determines the broadening of the spectral weight in a particular single - particle state , and the form of @xmath84 defined in eq .",
    "( [ selfnfl ] ) indicates that the states at the fermi energy suffer the least broadening .",
    "as a result , the effective density of states is largest at the fermi energy , leading to the zero - bias peak .",
    "more importantly , for non - fermi liquids the power @xmath5 in @xmath85 is smaller than 1 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath84 is not negligible even for small @xmath86 and consequently , the zero - bias peak is observable in reality .",
    "it is also noteworthy to mention that although the formalism presented here adopts a form obtained from the perturbative rpa approach , the increase of the effective density of states at the fermi energy is also obtained from the non - perturbative multidimensional bosonization technique@xcite .",
    "another intriguing feature is that while the dc resistivity shows a significant change with respect to the structural and magnetic phase transitions , the pcs conductance seems to be insensitive to them .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the different nature of these two measurements .",
    "dc conductivity , by definition , is the _ current - current correlation function _ at zero frequency @xmath87 , and typically it can be expressed using the drude formula which can be obtained by applying the relaxation - time approximation to the kubo formula@xcite : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the transport relaxation time averaged over the brillouin zone . as a result ,",
    "the dc resistivity is proportional to @xmath90 , which is highly sensitive to the change in the lattice due to the structural phase transition . in our formalism , the pcs conductance measures the _ integrated single - particle spectral function_. since the transport relaxation time is related to the inverse of the self energy at the fermi energy , its presence only broadens the delta - function - like peaks in the single - particle spectral function . as a result ,",
    "as we integrate the single - particle spectral function over the whole brillouin zone , fermi surface reconstructions due to phase transitions play a very small role in the measured pcs conductance .",
    "exception will be the case when the phase transition opens a gap near the fermi energy . in this case , the density of states of the reconstructed fermi surface changes radically due to the gap formation , which would be detected by the pcs ( see supplementary materials ) .",
    "since iron pnictides and chalcogenides remains metallic through the structural and magnetic phase transitions , the pcs conductance is insensitive to these phase transitions .",
    "we have developed a quantum theory to show that pcs is capable of detecting an effective density of states arising from non - fermi liquid behavior . for junctions in the thermal regime , where the electron mean free path is smaller than the junction size ,",
    "quasiparticle transport is well - described by the current - current correlation function according to the kubo formalism , so the behavior is as a simple resistor .",
    "as the junction size is reduced to the ballistic ( sharvin ) regime , we have shown that the pcs conductance is consistently described with a single - particle green function , according to the skbk formalism with a set of reasonable approximations .",
    "we have shown that the microscopic model for pcs can be reduced to a tunneling model with only momentum - conserving processes in the classical ( ballistic ) limit . furthermore , since pcs samples the effective density of states obtained from integration over whole fermi surface , it is insensitive to simple fermi surface reconstruction without a gap , so is a filter for non - fermi liquid - like behavior .",
    "we have specifically demonstrated that the zero - bias peak observed in the pcs measurement in iron pnictides and chalcogenides is due to a non - fermi liquid behavior , which can be induced by orbital fluctuations .",
    "this theory can also be used to explain why the non - fermi liquid density of states can be detected in heavy fermions and quantum critical materials .",
    "our results shed a new light on application of pcs to investigate strongly correlated systems , and to determine if a new material , in fact , exhibits strong electron correlations .",

    "typlically , @xmath98 should be no more than a few mevs , otherwise it will be considered as a bad contact@xcite .",
    "the result in this section can be applied to some interacting systems in which fermi surface reconstruction with a gap opening near the fermi energy occurs at low temperatures and the associated fluctuations are negligible . in this case",
