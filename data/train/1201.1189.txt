    "gravity - driven instabilities include landslides , mountain collapse , rockfalls , ice mass break - off and snow avalanches .",
    "they pose a considerable risk to mountain communities , real - estate development , tourist activities and hydropower energy generation .",
    "gravity - driven instabilities are the most widespread natural hazard on earth . in the us and europe , they are particularly significant and cause billions of dollars and euros damage each year .",
    "prediction of such gravity - driven instabilities could be used by policy makers to decide on possible evacuation of the potential dangerous area .",
    "unfortunately , accurate prediction of such phenomena remains a challenge .    in this context , studying glacier break - off is of particular interest because a glacier consists of a unique natural material ( ice ) where the interface between ice and bedrock is well defined .",
    "this relative simplicity of the system allows to particularly focus our study on the rupture processes leading to the initiation of the instability .",
    "two types of glacier instabilities leading to icefalls may be distinguished : ( i ) mechanical instabilities and ( ii ) sliding instabilities .",
    "mechanical instabilities mainly affect unbalanced cold hanging glaciers ( i.e. snow accumulation is mostly compensated with break - off , ) . based on field data combining surface displacement measurements and seismic activity before break - off , showed that a prediction of the event was possible .",
    "the case of sliding instabilities is more problematic .",
    "they occur on temperate glaciers ( i.e. glaciers that can slide on their beds ) where subglacial hydrology plays a major role .",
    "melt water flowing on the glacier bed may influence the glacier dynamics in two ways : it allows ( i ) a better lubrication of the bed and ( ii ) , if water becomes pressurized , an uplift decouples the glacier from its bed . in the alps ,",
    "only two glaciers are known to have given rise to such sliding instabilities in the 20th century : the glacier du tour ( mont blanc , france ) in 1949 and the allalingletscher ( valais , switzerland ) in 1965 .",
    "up to now , such glacier instabilities are still unpredictable , and the causes of such catastrophic break - off remain unclear .    the present paper is devoted to the study of such instabilities , taking the allalingletscher as an example .",
    "this glacier is indeed of particular interest because it experienced 2 catastrophic break - offs ( in 1965 and 2000 ) and also because a unique set of data was collected since the first catastrophic break - off in 1965 . to address the open questions on the initiation of the instability , we apply a general numerical model developped to investigate gravity - driven instabilities in heterogeneous media .",
    "this model was already successfully applied to a polythermal glacier becoming partly temperate at its bedrock , i.e. the altelsgletscher .",
    "numerical results showed that the final instability is driven by a progressive cold - temperate transition at the ice / bed interface .",
    "the present study significantly differs from the previous case as here the whole glacier is temperate and can slide on its bedrock . as subglacial water was shown to drive the sliding instabilities , the initial model was extended to account for subglacial water flow at the bedrock .    after describing the allalingletscher and analysing available measurements",
    ", we apply a general numerical model to this particular gravity - driven instability to assess the causes of the rupture .",
    "numerical results are discussed and general criterions leading to the instability are presented .",
    "allalingletscher is referred to as early as 1300 in written documents , in connection with the right of pasturage .",
    "the glacier is mentioned again and again , through the centuries , mainly in reference to floods caused during stages of glacier advance , and also when it interrupted the path leading to alpine meadows and pass routes to italy .",
    "the hydrological bassin of allalin ( 12 @xmath0 , 81 @xmath1 glacierized ) , located near the head of the valley of saas , consists of a hanging valley , from which the lower part of the glacier tongue extends and flows down the sidewall of the main valley . during the little age ,",
    "the terminus reached and blocked the river saaser vispa leading to the formation of the lake of mattmark .",
    "the extend of the allalingletscher has been inferred by ltschg ( see reference in @xcite ) from references to the size of the lake and to the floods which originated in the outburst of the ice - dammed lake",
    ". combining such information with direct references to the size of the glacier , he assembled a detailed chronicle of the glacier through the centuries , listing large extension of the glacier in 1300 and 1589 , and on other occasions during the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries .",
    "maximum known extends occurred in 1822/1823 and 1858 . the @xmath2 century maximum in 1923 was smaller , although the terminus still crossed the main river .",
    "after that , an almost uninterrupted retreat lasting 31 years from 1923 ( fig .",
    "[ general situation ] ) until 1954 occurred . according to the records published in @xcite",
    ", the retreat amounted to about 230 m from 1923 to 1943 , 660 m from 1943 to 1949 , and 90 m from 1949 to 1954 .",
    "the very rapid retreat in the forties was due to the decay of the thinned - down snout on the east - facing rock slope of the lower part of the saas valley sidewall . between 1954 and 1964",
    "the terminus has been approximately stationary ( fig .",
    "[ geometric_evolution ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "glacier sliding instabilities may occur on temperate glacier tongues .",
    "such instabilities are strongly affected by the subglacial hydrology : infiltrated melt water may indeed cause ( i ) a lubrication of the bed and ( ii ) a decrease of the effective pressure at the glacier bed and consequently a decrease of basal friction .",
    "available data from allalingletscher ( valais , switzerland ) indicate that the glacier tongue experienced an active phase during 2 - 3 weeks in summer in most years between 1965 - 2000 with strongly enhanced basal motion .",
    "this glacier broke - off twice in 1965 and 2000 . in order to scrutinize in more detail the processes governing the sliding instabilities ,",
    "a numerical model developed to investigate gravitational instabilities in heterogeneous media was applied to allalingletscher .",
    "this modified spring - block model enables to account for various geometrical configurations of the glacier and also for interactions between basal sliding and tension cracking .",
    "the impact of subglacial water flow on basal motion was included in the model .",
    "our results indicate that basically three conditions have to be fulfilled for a break - off to occur in the case of a sliding instability : ( i ) a critical geometrical configuration of the glacier tongue is needed , where the glacier terminus rests on a steep slope .",
    "( ii ) the glacier has to experience an  active phase \" during which basal motion drastically increases , ( iii ) the subglacial drainage network has to be distributed .",
    "moreover , our modeling results point out that the break - off always occurs after a sudden phase of recoupling of the glacier on its bedrock , characterized by a drop of subglacial water flow .",
    "this new precursory sign was observed for both 1965 and 2000 break - off event .",
    "we also showed that all these conditions were fulfilled in 1949 before the break - off of the glacier du tour , and moreover , we demonstrated that the same drop of subglacial water runoff occurred five days before the catastrophic break - off , indicating that this new precursory sign might be decisive .",
    "in a more general context , climate change may affect the stability of steep glacier tongues , as they retreat and may evolve toward a critical geometry .",
    "this model casts a gleam of hope for a better understanding of the ultimate rupture of such glacier sliding instabilities .",
    "this appendix complements section [ frictionlawchap ] by providing details of the calculation of the critical time at which unstable sliding of a given block occurs . section [ frictionlawchap ] describes the sub - critical sliding process of a given block interacting via state - and - velocity solid friction with its inclined basal surface .",
    "when the sub - critical sliding velocity @xmath3 diverges ( we refer to the time when this occurs as the `` critical time '' @xmath4 for the frictional sliding instability ) , this indicates a change towards a dynamical sliding regime where inertia ( the block mass and its acceleration in the newton s law ) has to be taken into account .",
    "let us calculate explicitly how the critical time @xmath4 is obtained and define its dependence on the parameters and boundary conditions .",
    "let us call @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) the total shear ( or normal ) force exerted on a given block , where @xmath7 is the force exerted by a neighboring spring bond , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the normal and tangential forces due to the weight of the block .",
    "we then have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angle of the basal surface supporting the block .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 as explained in section [ frictionlawchap ] , @xmath13 is usually very small for natural material , of the order of @xmath14 . for the sake of simplicity , we assume @xmath15 . as recalled in section [ frictionlawchap ]",
    ", this choice is not restrictive as it recovers the two important regimes .",
    "this leads to @xmath16 whose solution is @xmath17    combining eqs .",
    "[ qwertyu ] and [ kgkgtw ] , we obtain @xmath18 after integration it reads @xmath19 and using equation ( [ kgkgtw ] ) , we obtain @xmath20 this expression exhibits the usual regimes : a finite time singularity is obtained for @xmath21 . in this case ,",
    "expression ( [ ghnt ] ) can be re - written as @xmath22 with @xmath23    we can simplify expression ( [ tfev ] ) by using the condition that , for @xmath24 , we should have @xmath25 .",
    "but , for @xmath26 , @xmath27 and thus , for the condition @xmath28 to hold , we need @xmath29 the final expression for the critical time @xmath4 signaling the transition from a subcritical sliding to the dynamical inertial sliding is , for @xmath30 , @xmath31 while @xmath28 for @xmath32 .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath33 has disappeared due to the relation ( [ hntbkwg ] ) .",
    "to summarize , a given configuration of blocks and spring tensions determines the value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 and therefore of @xmath34 via ( [ hjgjhnten ] ) . knowing @xmath34 and given the other material parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we determine the time @xmath4 for the transition to the dynamical regime for that block via equation ( [ tkhntrk ] ) .",
    "the simulation of the frictional process for each given block proceeds as follows :    1 .   a given configuration of blocks and spring tensions determines the value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each block , and therefore their solid friction coefficient @xmath34 corresponds to the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "2 .   at a given time , knowing the runoff at the outlet , @xmath38 is evaluated for a given block with eq .",
    "[ frictionqdep ] .",
    "3 .   knowing @xmath34 for a given block and with the other material parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 for that block , the time @xmath4 for the transition to the dynamical sliding regime is calculated with expression  ( [ frictionlaw ] ) .",
    "[ frictionlaw ] for @xmath4 gives the waiting time until the next block starts to slide .",
    "4 .   when the block undergoes a transition into the dynamical sliding regime at time @xmath4 , its subsequent dynamics should obey newton s law .",
    "the dynamical slide of the block goes on as long as the velocity of the block remains positive .",
    "when its velocity reaches zero , we assume that the block is no more sliding . to account for the heterogeneity and roughness of the sliding surface ,",
    "we assume that the state variable @xmath39 is reset to a new random value after the dynamical sliding stops .",
    "this random value is taken to reflect the characteristics of the new asperities constituting the fresh surface of contact .",
    "6 .   after a dynamical slide ,",
    "the forces exerted by the springs that connect the block to its neighbors are updated , as is the new gravitational force ( if the basal surface has a curvature ) , the new value of @xmath34 is obtained , the time counter for frictional creep is reset to zero , and a new process of slow frictional creep develops over the new waiting time @xmath4 , that is , in general , different from the previous one .      1",
    ".   given an initial configuration of all the blocks within the network , the elastic forces exerted by all bonds can be calculated from their extension / compression .",
    "2 .   for each bond",
    "@xmath40 subjected to an initial stress @xmath41 , we calculate the corresponding critical time @xmath42 at which it would rupture if neither of the two blocks connected to it moved in the meantime . for those bonds where @xmath43 defined in equation ( [ tcs ] )",
    ", @xmath42 is infinite .",
    "3 .   some bonds will eventually fail , modifying the force balance on their blocks and accelerating the transition to the sliding regime , after which the stresses in the bonds connected to the same blocks are modified .",
