    "in the @xmath11-cold dark matter ( @xmath11-cdm ) paradigm , larger galaxies are hierarchically assembled by merging of small cold dark matter fragments @xcite , as also recently confirmed by the high - resolution simulations ",
    "aquarius \" @xcite .",
    "the idea is attractive when applied to our galaxy , since it echoes the pioneering scenario suggested by @xcite ( sz ) , in which the milky way ( mw ) was successively built up from small substructures .",
    "indeed , first attempts to link the sz scenario with the cosmological simulations foresaw the assembling of the galactic halo starting from a number of satellites , and producing a number of tidal streams that should be ( and are in fact ) observed @xcite .",
    "the survivors of such a process should have the observational characteristics of the present day dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , which are old , metal - poor and gas deficient systems .    however , according to the @xmath11-cdm theory , the expected number of surviving fragments of the accretion process is one or two orders of magnitude larger than the observed number of mw  bright \" dsph companions .",
    "it was also pointed out that the present - day  bright \" dwarfs may be the _ wrong _",
    "remnants , as they could be instead tidal dwarf galaxies , with a non - primordial origin ( e.g. @xcite ) . in any case",
    "this so - called  missing satellites problem \" @xcite has represented , so far , a major issue of the comparison between theoretical expectations and observational evidence .",
    "the discrepancy was partially alleviated in the past few years by the discovery of several  ultra - faint \" dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) surrounding the mw , on the basis of the analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the ufds bring the number of known mw dsph satellites to @xmath12 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . since the sky coverage of the sdss is only @xmath13 of the celestial sphere",
    ", basic statistical arguments suggest that tens of these faint mw satellites are still undiscovered , thus further narrowing the gap between theoretical expectations and observational evidence unless , as suggested by @xcite , the distribution of these faint systems is not uniform and follows instead a disc around the mw .",
    "whatever the case , in order to be  proper \" remnants of the _ primordial _ galactic halo contributors the observed satellites should host old stellar populations with properties compatible with those of the mw halo . in particular , they should contain stars as metal - poor as @xmath14   < -3.0 $ ] or @xmath15 dex (  extremely metal - poor stars \" , @xcite ) and rr lyrae stars with pulsation properties conforming to the oosterhoff dichotomy @xcite observed for field and cluster mw rr lyrae variables ( @xcite , and references therein ) . regarding both aspects the  bright \" mw dsph satellites do not seem to be the possible primordial contributors to the galactic halo , as spectroscopic studies ( e.g. @xcite ) show that there are very few extremely metal - poor stars in most of the  bright \" mw dsph satellites ( tolstoy et al .",
    "2009 , and reference therein ) and , on the other hand , these galaxies are generally classified as  oosterhoff - intermediate \" ( e.g. carina : @xcite ; fornax : @xcite ) because their fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars have average periods ( @xmath16 ) intermediate between the oosterhoff i ( ooi ; @xmath17 = 0.55 days ) and ii ( ooii ; @xmath17 = 0.65 days ) types observed for the mw field and cluster variables .",
    "the ursa minor dsph ( @xmath17 = 0.638 days ) and the sagittarius ( @xmath17 = 0.574 days ) are the only exceptions to this generally accepted `` rule '' among the  bright \" dwarfs ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the ufds , instead , seem to possess both proper metal abundances , as shown by a number of spectroscopic studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as compatible properties of stellar populations and variable stars , as shown by our long - term project to monitor the ufd variable stars ( see @xcite , for a summary ) . in brief , the five galaxies we have studied so far , namely , bootes  i ( @xcite ) , canes venatici  i ( cvni ; @xcite ) , canes venatici  ii ( cvnii ; @xcite ) , coma berenices ( coma ; @xcite ) , and leo iv ( @xcite ) , contain rr lyrae stars with pulsation periods suggesting an oo  ii classification , with the exception being cvni , which appears to be oosterhoff - intermediate . in this respect , we remark that both total luminosity and global metallicity of cvni make this object more likely a  classical \" dsph than a ufd ( see e.g. fig . 5 of @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite umaii appears to be a very elongated and extended object , likely undergoing tidal disruption .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the existence of a velocity gradient along the major axis of @xmath24 km @xmath25 between eastern and western sides of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this gradient shows the same direction of elongation as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the galaxy was proposed to be the progenitor of the so - called orphan stream @xcite . @xcite",
    "derived a half light radius of @xmath26 for the galaxy , and highlighted that the central part of umaii breaks up into three distinct clumps .",
    "subsequently , @xcite on the basis of deep , wide - field canada - france - hawaii telescope photometry , showed that this apparent clumping is due to the poor statistics of the bright stars , and disappears when deeper data are used .",
    "moreover , they showed that umaii is more extended than previously thought .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by @xcite , from the analysis of the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue , @xcite ) spectroscopic and sdss / segue photometric data .",
    "these findings seem to rule out the link between umaii and the orphan stream .",
    "spectroscopic studies disclosed the presence of very metal - poor stars in the galaxy , with [ fe / h ] @xmath27 dex , and detailed abundance patterns consistent with those observed in the galactic halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite derived new structural parameters for umaii , adopting a slightly different position for the galaxy centre and a flatter shape with a slightly larger @xmath28 , compared to @xcite . in the following we use the structural parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "however , our conclusions would not be affected whether we used martin et al.s parameters , instead .",
    "time - series observations of umaii were obtained between january and march 2007 with three different telescopes . at the wyoming infrared observatory ( wiro ) 2.3 m telescope , using the wiro prime focus camera , we obtained 40 images in johnson @xmath29 , 12 images in johnson @xmath30 , and 22 images in cousins @xmath31 .",
    "at the 1.8 m perkins telescope of the lowell observatory , we used the perkins re - imaging system ( prism ) instrument in photometry mode to obtain 12 @xmath29 , 4 @xmath30 and 4 @xmath31 images of umaii .",
    "five nights at the loiano observatory 1.5 m telescope provided 14 @xmath30 and 15 @xmath29 images using the bologna faint object spectrograph and camera ( bfosc ) .",
    "the wiro observations cover the largest area with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath32 at the pixel scale of @xmath33 arcsec / pix , pointed on the center coordinates of umaii derived by @xcite .",
    "the fovs at the lowell and loiano telescopes are slightly smaller , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 arcsec / pix ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 arcsec / pix ) , respectively . the total area covered by our observations is @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to the central clump of umaii , while the other two clumps reported by @xcite are both slightly outside the field covered by our observations .",
    "the log of observations is provided in table [ tab_log ] .",
    "datasets from each observatory were pre - reduced using standard iraf techniques ( bias subtraction and flat fielding ) .",
    "since we lack a photometric calibration of the @xmath31-band data , observations in this band were not considered in the subsequent analysis and only the @xmath0 data are presented in the paper .",
    "point - spread function ( psf ) photometry was performed with the daophot iv / allframe @xcite package .",
    "after an accurate evaluation of the psf of each individual frame , a reference image was built by averaging all the available frames and a source catalogue was extracted from the stacked image .",
    "the source list was then passed to allframe , which performed homogeneous psf photometry simultaneously on all images , thus producing @xmath39 and @xmath40 instrumental magnitude catalogues for each telescope .",
    "typical internal photometric errors were of the order of @xmath41 mag at the horizontal branch ( hb ) level , on the averaged catalog , while the signal - to - noise ratio greatly changes between the individual exposures , due to the different telescope sizes and very different exposure times adopted at the various sites .    to calibrate our photometry ,",
    "additional @xmath0 observations of umaii , along with standard fields centered on the open clusters ngc 188 and ngc 7790 , selected from the publicly available standard stars archive maintained by p.  b. stetson , were obtained on a photometric night in 2008 january , at the 3.5 m telescopio nazionale galileo in la palma , canary islands .",
    "we used the standard la palma extinction coefficientsdwe / srf / camc_extinction.html ] to derive the following calibration equations :    @xmath42    where @xmath0 and @xmath43 are the standard and the instrumental magnitudes , respectively .",

    "these calibrations were used to define secondary standards in the field of umaii . in particular ,",
    "we selected 25 isolated local standards with photometric errors less than @xmath50 mag which were visually inspected to remove any non - stellar objects .",
    "the remaining stars cover a range in color of @xmath51 mag .",
    "since the three telescopes define slightly different photometric systems , the individual datasets were calibrated separately , and for each filter a final master catalogue was obtained by averaging the measurements of the individual telescopes .",
    "typical uncertainties in calibrating our dataset on the tng local standards were in the range @xmath52 mag .",
    "figure [ errbv ] shows the photometric internal error as a function of the calibrated magnitude , both in the @xmath30 and @xmath29 bands .",
    "for each star calibrated time - series photometry was obtained firstly by shifting the instrumental magnitudes to the wiro instrumental photometric system , and then calibrating the wiro - aligned data to the johnson photometric system .",
    "we omitted the relative color term dependence since the relative color terms were small enough in the observed color range of the rr lyrae stars ( @xmath53 mag ) to be considered negligible for our purposes .",
    "search and identification of candidate variable stars were performed with two different methods : 1 ) the @xcite variability index , which compares the spread of individual measurements with the intrinsic photometric error ; 2 ) an _ ad hoc _ procedure in which we first computed the fourier transforms ( in the @xcite formulation ) of the stars having at least 12 measurements in each photometric band , and then we averaged these transforms to estimate the noise and calculated the signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "results from @xmath30 and @xmath29 photometries were cross - correlated , and all stars with s / n@xmath54 4 in both photometric bands were visually inspected , for a total of @xmath55 candidates . in particular , we checked all the stars around the galaxy s horizontal branch and some of the stars in the blue stragglers region of the cmd which might be pulsating variables of the sx phoenicis type .",
    "the light curves of the candidate variables were inspected by eye .",
    "we confirmed only one candidate variable , whose multiband light curves were analyzed with the graphical analyzer of time series ( gratis , @xcite ) package , obtaining a classification as rr lyrae with pulsation period of 0.6593 days .",
    "we note that the time window of our data would imply an accuracy on the second decimal place of the derived period , however , we have used a period value to the forth decimal place to fold the light curves of the rr lyrae star , since this allowed us to significantly reduce the rms scatter of the truncated fourier series best fitting the data .",
    "the star s time series data are provided in table  2 and the pulsation characteristics ( period , epoch of maximum light , amplitudes of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 light variations , and intensity - averaged mean magnitudes ) are summarized in table  3 .",
    "the internal accuracy of the average magnitudes of the rr lyrae star is of @xmath56 0.02 mag , as estimates from the rms scatter of the models best fitting the light curves . for the amplitudes we list both the values of the difference between minimum and maximum light data points , and the values of the truncated fourier series best fit models of the light curves ( in brackets ) .",
    "corresponding uncertainties in the amplitudes are of the order of 0.1 mag .",
    "light curves are shown in figure  [ lightcurve ] .",
    "figure [ bailey ] shows the position of the only rr lyrae in umaii on the period - amplitude diagram defined by the rr lyrae stars of the bootesi , cvnii , coma , and leoiv ufds .",
    "the pulsation period and the position on the period - amplitude diagram both suggest the similarity of umaii to oosterhoff type ii systems .",
    "this classification is unchanged if we round the period to two decimal places .",
    "figure [ cmd_ridge ] shows the cmd of umaii with the rr lyrae star marked by a cyan filled circle . the @xmath57 color of the rr lyrae star ( @xmath58 = 0.22 mag ) appears to be slightly too blue for the star pulsation period .",
    "we will discuss this further at the end of the section .",
    "we have estimated the distance to umaii from its rr lyrae , by adopting the calibration of the absolute @xmath29 magnitude of the rr lyrae stars as a function of the metallicity provided by @xcite and @xcite , who derived @xmath59 = 0.214 \\pm 0.047 $ ] mag / dex from a sample of 100 rr lyrae stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) spanning the metallicity range from [ fe / h]=@xmath60 2.12 to @xmath600.27 dex , and the rr lyrae zero - point @xmath61 mag at @xmath62=-1.5 $ ] dex , proposed by @xcite .",
    "we explicitly note that , selecting a brighter zero - point of @xmath63 mag at @xmath62=-1.5 $ ] dex , which is in agreement with the lmc distance modulus of @xmath64 mag @xcite , the kernel of our analysis is not changed . adopting a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath65 dex for umaii @xcite , an average apparent magnitude of the umaii hb of @xmath66 mag ,",
    "as derived from the galaxy rr lyrae star , and a reddening of @xmath67 mag from the @xcite maps , we obtain a true distance modulus for the galaxy of @xmath68 mag , corresponding to @xmath69 kpc .",
    "the quoted uncertainty takes into account only the uncertainties of the intrinsic photometry , of the photometric calibration , and of the slope and zeropoint of the rr lyrae m@xmath70 - [ fe / h ] relationship .",
    "however , as pointed out by our refereee , the umaii red giants exhibit a considerable spread in metal abundance , ( @xmath71}$]=0.57 dex , according to @xcite ) , that we should take into account since we lack a direct estimate of metallicity for the rr lyrae star .",
    "this translates into an additional uncertainty of @xmath560.12 mag on the distance modulus , which thus becomes @xmath72 mag , corresponding to @xmath73 kpc .",
    "we also note that , since the @xmath74 $ ] relationship is extrapolated for metallicities below [ fe / h]=@xmath60 2.1 dex and there are claims that it may not be unique and/or linear ( e.g. @xcite ) , this error might still be an underestimate .",
    "our distance agrees within the uncertainties with the value obtained by @xcite ( @xmath75 mag ) based on isochrone - fitting of the main sequence and turn - off regions .",
    "our distance of 34.7 kpc also agrees with the predictions of the heliocentric distance to umaii by @xcite .",
    "these authors simulated the orbit of umaii obtaining for the galaxy a distance of 34 kpc , which taken at the face value would support their suggestion that umaii is the progenitor of the orphan stream .",
    "however , the n - body simulations by @xcite show that there is no obvious link between the orphan stream and the orbit of umaii .",
    "as mentioned previously the rr lyrae star shows a rather blue @xmath57 color .",
    "we do not have a clear explanation for this occurence , as the image of the star does not seem to be contaminated by any companion , and the good agreement with the hb ridgeline of m68 as well as with the theoretical models by @xcite ( see below ) both in the @xmath76 and @xmath77 planes , seem to support the notion that the star is not affected by blending with a hot companion or by deceptive photometric errors . on the other hand ,",
    "our @xmath30 light curve is based only on six different epochs , as the 12 exposures obtained at the wiro telescope span a very short time interval and contribute in fact only 2 distinct epochs , thus the derived @xmath78 magnitude may be somewhat uncertain .",
    "however , this uncertainty does not affect significantly our distance estimate .",
    "our time - series photometry was referred to the wiro data , with photometric transformations to the johnson standard system given by    @xmath79    which translate into the @xmath29-@xmath80 transformation    @xmath81    therefore , a shift as large as @xmath82 mag of the star @xmath57 color ( thus pushing the variable on the `` red '' side of the instability strip ) , would affect the derived @xmath83 luminosity by @xmath84 mag at most .",
    "figure [ cmd_ridge ] shows our cmd of umaii , where to minimize the contamination by non - point sources we only plot objects with daophot parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 and also considered only stars within the galaxy s half light radius ( @xmath87 arcmin , as worked out from the preliminary values of distance , @xmath88 kpc , and linear half light radius @xmath89pc , published by @xcite ) .",
    "umaii appears to be quite elongated with an ellipticity of @xmath90 , therefore we adopted the azimuthally averaged value of the half light radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "we explicitly note that umaii shows a rapidly varying ellipticity , with values ranging from @xmath91 in the center to @xmath92 near its half light radius @xcite , but this does not affect our conclusions about the stellar populations present in the galaxy .",
    "the rr lyrae star we have discovered in the galaxy is marked by a cyan filled circle , while the cyan filled triangle shows the position of star sdssj084947.6 + 630830 , which was suspected to be an rr lyrae variable by @xcite on the basis of the observed radial velocity and spectral type variations .",
    "unfortunately , this star falls outside our field of view .",
    "nevertheless , we show its position on our cmd , after transforming the sdss @xmath93 magnitudes to the johnson standard system with the relations by @xcite , as it appears to be consistent with the rr lyrae instability strip , thus supporting the @xcite hypothesis .",
    "blue , red , magenta and cyan open circles mark spectroscopically confirmed members of umaii according to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively . no correction for contamination by galactic field stars was made , as our attempt to compare the ppm - extended ( ppmx ) proper motions catalog @xcite of the spectroscopically confirmed umaii members with all the other stars present in the field did not show a clear separation .",
    "umaii is characterized by a very low average metal abundance @xmath94 [ fe / h ] @xmath95 = @xmath96 dex , an internal metallicity spread as large as @xmath97 dex ( @xcite ) , and @xmath98 element abundances in agreement with those observed in the galactic halo ( @xmath99=0.4 $ ] dex ( @xcite , and references therein ) . in figure [ cmd_ridge ]",
    "we have overplotted to the umaii cmd the ridgelines of the galactic gcs m68 ( blue dashed line , from @xcite ) and m5 ( blue solid line , from @xcite ) , because these two gcs well encompass the metallicity range found in the galaxy . indeed ,",
    "m68 is a metal - poor cluster , with @xmath62=-2.27 \\pm 0.04 $ ] dex @xcite , and more recent determinations claim an even lower metallicity of @xmath62=-2.44 \\pm 0.1 $ ] dex ( @xcite ) , hence very similar to the average metallicity of umaii ; m5 is a metal - intermediate cluster , with @xmath62=-1.33 \\pm 0.02 $ ] dex @xcite .",
    "the ridgelines were properly shifted to account for differences in distance and reddening .",
    "for m68 we used the rr lyrae mean apparent _ v _ magnitude @xmath100 mag by @xcite and a reddening of @xmath101 mag , as available in the compilation by @xcite . with these values",
    "we get an apparent distance modulus of @xmath102 mag , by adopting the rr lyrae magnitude - metallicity calibration as above . for m5",
    ", we have adopted @xmath103 mag from @xcite and @xmath104 mag @xcite .",
    "our rr lyrae - based distance to umaii is supported by the good match of the m68 ridgelines and the umaii subgiant branch ( sgb ) , and by the very satisfactory alignment , along both the m68 and m5 hbs , of three _ bona - fide _ umaii stars , one of them being a spectroscopically confirmed member .",
    "the good match between few stars located at @xmath29 in the range from @xmath105 to @xmath106 mag and @xmath57 color between @xmath107 and @xmath108 mag , two of which are spectroscopically confirmed members of umaii with the m5 ridgeline seems to suggest the presence of a second sgb .",
    "this is not surprising , since the quoted spectroscopic works clearly demonstrate the occurrence of stellar populations with different metallicities in this ufd .",
    "moreover , the galaxy _ bona - fide _ main sequence appears to have an observed width of @xmath109 mag in the range of luminosities between @xmath110 and @xmath111 mag , while the width expected in that range due to the photometric errors alone would be of the order of @xmath112 mag ( see fig .",
    "[ errbv ] ) . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the stars close to the m68 and m5 ridgelines as  blue \" and  red \" populations , respectively . to check",
    "if the blue and red population are also compatible with a spread in the age , we have compared in figure [ cmd_basti ] the cmd of umaii with the basti ( bag of stellar tracks and isochrones ) @xmath98-enhanced isochrones by @xcite .",
    "following the recent @xmath98-enhanced abundances measured by @xcite , we have adopted for the blue population the @xmath113enhanced models with @xmath114 and @xmath99=0.4 $ ] dex , corresponding to an iron - over - hydrogen ratio of @xmath62=-2.62 $ ] dex and a global metallicity of @xmath115=-2.27 $ ] dex , and ages of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 gyr .",

    "we stress that our selection of the isochrones is entirely based on the _ measured _ metallicities .",
    "it is also important to note that umaii hosts a very metal - poor stellar component with [ fe / h ] = @xmath122 dex , ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the basti database does not contain such low metallicities .",
    "we also explicitly note that the spectroscopically confirmed member of umaii at @xmath123 mag and @xmath124 mag has a measured metallicity of @xmath62 = -1.8 $ ] dex ( sdssj085117.07 + 630347.3 , @xcite ) and appears to be definitely too red for its metallicity , being redder than spectroscopically confirmed members close to the m5 ridgeline and the @xmath125 isochrones .",
    "the star could be contaminated by a red companion , even if the values of its daophot structural parameters @xmath126 and _ sharpness _ do not support this explanation .",
    "strangely , this star is not present in the 2mass catalog , even if stars of similar luminosity are reported .",
    "the isochrone fitting appears to be quite satisfactory ( see fig .  [ cmd_basti ] ) but , as commented by the referee , the small statistics does not allow us to prove the existence of two _ distinct _ stellar populations , with different age and/or metallicity in umaii .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xcite suggested the presence of an age / metallicity spread in umaii that could be accounted for by an an intermediate - metallicity stellar population with age of at least 10 gyr .",
    "we do not recover such a spread , but our data marginally suggest a gap between the metal - poor and the metal - intermediate sgbs . if this gap is not due to the poor statistics , umaii may have experienced distinct bursts of star formation during its star formation history , similar to those found in the carina dwarf galaxy @xcite , for example .",
    "however , an alternative , intriguing explanation has been proposed by @xcite , who suggested that in the poor baryonic matter content of the ufds , pristine ( i.e. population iii ) core collapse ( and maybe pair - instability ) supernova events may have suppressed further star formation and inhibited a homogeneous mixing of the interstellar medium . according to this model , stars born close to the core collapse sne progenitors would be chemically enriched from the supernova yields , while more distant stars would not .",
    "therefore , the stellar populations in umaii could have the same age but different metallicity as arising from differently enriched material . alternatively",
    ", several population iii snes could have enriched the environment but , given the shallow potential well of the ufds , part of the enriched gas was lost @xcite . in either the case , this kind of galaxies should be regarded as ",
    "one - shot events \" .",
    "our photometric data do not allow us to distinguish between the two possible scenarios since the red population is reasonably well described by isochrones in the range between 11 and 14 gyrs .    in order to verify whether the stellar populations show a different spatial distribution in the field of view covered by our observations",
    ", we have used the ridgelines of m68 and m5 to select stars possibly compatible with a blue and a red population , and plotted them on the galaxy map with different colors .",
    "this is shown in figures [ cmd_sel ] and [ map_sel ] .",
    "in particular , figure [ cmd_sel ] illustrates our selection of the two components by displaying as blue and red filled circles the sources , within the umaii half light radius , which lie within @xmath127 mag in @xmath57 for @xmath128 mag and @xmath129 mag in @xmath57 for @xmath130 mag from the ridgelines of m68 and m5 , respectively . while the selection is rather straightforward for @xmath131 mag , at fainter magnitudes",
    "the two components can not be totally separated .",
    "we have marked in green the sources with @xmath132 mag which could belong to either population .",
    "figure [ map_sel ] shows the spatial location of these blue- , red- , and green - coded populations , in the fov covered by our observations , for sources with @xmath128 mag ( upper panel ) and for all sources ( lower panel ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ map_sel ] shows that sources brighter than @xmath133 mag lying closer to the m68 ridgeline ( blue filled circles ) are larger in number and seem to be more concentrated towards the center of umaii than sources closer to the m5 ridgeline ( red filled circles ) , but this could be an effect due to the poor statistics . on the other hand",
    ", the lower panel of figure [ map_sel ] shows that sources fainter than @xmath134 mag , which could belong either to the m68-like or to the m5-like population ( green filled circles ) , do not show any obvious pattern .",
    "we have presented the first johnson @xmath135 cmd of the umaii ufd galaxy and reported the detection of a _ bona - fide _ rr lyrae star in the galaxy , from which we have derived a true distance modulus of @xmath136 mag ( d=@xmath7 kpc ) .",
    "the error quoted in the brackets takes into account our lack of knowledge of the metallicity of the rr lyrae star .",
    "the pulsation period of this variable ( p=0.6593 days ) and its position in the period - amplitude ( bailey ) diagram suggests the similarity of umaii with oosterhoff type ii systems . a comparison of the observed cmd with the location of umaii spectroscopically confirmed member stars ( taken from the catalogs of @xcite ) and with the fiducial lines of the galactic gcs m68 and m5 is compatible with a spread in age / metallicity of the stellar content of the galaxy .",
    "the inner brightness profile of umaii , as suggested by @xcite on the basis of deep cfht photometry , could be due to the presence of multiple stellar generations , as also postulated in @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison with the isochrones gives only a coarse estimate of the age of the stellar populations , and no definite conclusion can be reached about a possible spread in age . on the other hand , when only the comparison with the m68 and m5 ridgelines is considered , the hypothesis of an age difference of @xmath121 gyr is favored .",
    "since the field covered by our photometry is smaller than the fields observed by the @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite studies , our conclusions apply mainly to the central part of umaii monitored by our data . a deeper , more accurate and more spatially extended photometry is therefore highly desided to unveil all the secrets of the umaii ufd .",
