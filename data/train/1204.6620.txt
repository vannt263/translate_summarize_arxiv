    "the recent development of the multi - level monte carlo method for sdes @xcite has revealed that strong error bounds are crucial for the efficient computation of functionals @xmath14 .    while the strong error measures the error of the approximate sample paths @xmath18 on average , the pathwise error is the random quantity @xmath30 and @xmath31 } |x_{t}(\\omega ) - \\overline{x}_{t}(\\omega)| , \\qquad \\omega \\in \\omega\\ ] ] respectively",

    "the traditional weak and strong convergence analysis for numerical methods for stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) relies on the global lipschitz assumption , i.e. the sde coefficients satisfy @xmath36 .",
    "however , in many sdes used for modelling in mathematical finance this assumption is violated , so the standard results ( see @xcite ) do not apply .",

    "for @xmath42 this is the standard black - scholes model ( i.e. a geometric brownian motion ) , while for @xmath43 the diffusion coefficient of this sde is clearly not globally lipschitz continuous .",

    ", this sde has a unique strong solution with values in @xmath49 .",
    "note that here the diffusion coefficient grows superlinearly for large values of @xmath50 while the drift coefficient has a singularity at @xmath51 .",
    "the heston model @xcite , which is an asset price model with stochastic volatility , is another example for an sde with non - lipschitz coefficients .",
    "this sde takes non - negative values only and contains square root coefficients : @xmath52 the parameters satisfy @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the second component of this sde is the cox - ingersoll - ross process , which is also used as a short rate model @xcite .    finally , the use of the inverse of the cir process as volatility process leads to the so - called @xmath56-model @xmath57 where @xmath58 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ motivated by these and other examples , the investigation of numerical methods for sdes with non - lipschitz coefficients has been an active field of research in recent years .",
    "this article , provides an overview of the new developments using the above equations as illustrative examples and discussing , in particular , euler - type schemes . for some of the above equations",
    "exact simulation methods exist , see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite for a class of one - dimensional equations , which are superior for the simulation of the sdes at a single or a few time points .",
    "however , if a full sample path of the sde has to be simulated or if the sdes under consideration are part of a larger sde system , then discretization schemes are typically more efficient .",
    "the pathwise error criteria are very robust with respect to the global lipschitz assumption .",
    "one of the simplest approximation schemes for equation ( [ itosde ] ) is the euler scheme @xmath59 with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the euler scheme ( and all other approximation methods that will be introduced below ) depend on the stepsize @xmath64 , hence on @xmath65 , but this dependence will be omitted whenever it is clear from the context .    from the results of gyngy @xcite it follows that the euler scheme has pathwise convergence order @xmath66 also if the sde coefficients are only locally lipschitz continuous : for all @xmath67 @xmath68 almost surely for a finite and non - negative random variable @xmath69 under the assumption that for all @xmath70 there exist constants @xmath71 such that @xmath72 thus , the pathwise convergence rate of the euler scheme coincides up to an arbitrarily small @xmath73 with its strong convergence rate @xmath74 , but for the pathwise convergence rate no global lipschitz assumption is required .",
    "jentzen , kloeden & neuenkirch @xcite observed that this is not a specific feature of the euler scheme but , in fact , holds for general it - taylor schemes of order @xmath75 .",
    "for the definition of these schemes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the euler scheme corresponds to @xmath76 , while @xmath77 yields the milstein scheme @xmath78 with the differential operators @xmath79 and the iterated it - integrals @xmath80 the it - taylor scheme of order @xmath81 is usually called the wagner - platen scheme .",
    "[ thm_pw_1 ] let @xmath82 @xmath8 @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath81 , @xmath85 .",

    "then for every @xmath73 there exists a non  negative random variable @xmath91 such that @xmath92 for almost all @xmath32 .",
    "the main ingredients to obtain this result are the burkholder - davis - gundy inequality , which implies that all moments of an it - integral are equivalent , the following borel - cantelli - type lemma , and a localization procedure .",
    "( see @xcite ) let @xmath93 , @xmath94 for @xmath27 and let @xmath95 be a sequence of random variables with    latexmath:[\\ [ ( { \\bf e }    @xmath27 and @xmath65 .",
    "then for every @xmath97 there exists a finite and non - negative random variable @xmath98 such that @xmath99 almost surely for all @xmath65 .",
    "the burkholder - davis - gundy inequality and the borel - cantelli - type lemma allow one to show that the it - taylor scheme of order @xmath82 has pathwise convergence rate @xmath100 for smooth and bounded coefficients with bounded derivatives , thereby extending the classical mean - square convergence analysis in @xcite .",
    "then a localization argument is applied to avoid the boundedness assumptions . roughly speaking",
    ", this localization argument works as follows : a fixed sample path @xmath101,$ ] of the sde solution is bounded , i.e. stays in some open set @xmath102 .",
    "however for the sde @xmath103 with smooth and bounded coefficients @xmath104 , @xmath105 with bounded derivatives , which coincide with the ones of the original sde on @xmath102 , the solution sample path @xmath106 $ ] , coincides with @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "asymptotically this also holds for the corresponding sample paths of the @xmath82-it - taylor schemes , so the pathwise convergence rates carry over .    note that all the examples of sdes given in the introduction take non - negative values only , so good approximation schemes should preserve this structural property .",
    "the ( explicit ) euler scheme is , in general , not such a scheme , since its increments are conditionally gaussian .",
    "for example , in case of the cir process @xmath108 the transition density of the euler scheme reads as @xmath109 so negative values can be obtained with positive probability even in the first step .",
    "this has lead to many ad - hoc corrections to prevent termination of the euler scheme .",
    "the truncated euler scheme @xmath110 was proposed in @xcite , while the scheme @xmath111 was studied in @xcite .",
    "both approaches extend the mapping @xmath112 suitably to negative values of @xmath50 . for the cir process",
    "this idea was taken further by lord , koekkoek & van dijk @xcite , who also proposed modifications of the drift coefficient for negative values of the state space .",
    "+    [ cir_scen_def ]    the following table shows the average number of negative steps per path for the above euler approximations of the cir process .",
    "scenario i ( taken from @xcite ) , corresponds to the parameters @xmath113 while scenario ii ( taken from @xcite ) uses @xmath114 the stepsize for the euler schemes is given by @xmath61 with @xmath115 .    [",

    "moreover , these results illustrate nicely the superiority of the multi - level estimator for small input accuracies .",
    "in this article we gave a survey on recent results on the convergence of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations in mathematical finance .",
    "the presented results include :    * the pathwise convergence of general it - taylor schemes for strictly positive sdes with smooth but not globally lipschitz coefficients ( section 2 ) ; * the construction of structure , i.e. positivity , preserving approximation schemes ( sections 2 and 5 ) ; * the strong convergence of euler - type methods for the cev model and the cir process ( section 3 ) ; * the explosion of the moments of the euler scheme for sdes for the 3/2-model ( section 3 ) ; * the strong convergence of the drift - implicit euler scheme for the ait - sahalia model ( section 4 ) ; * strong convergence rates for the approximation of the cir and the log - heston model using a drift - implicit euler - type method ( section 5 ) .",
    "however many unsettled questions are remaining : the exact strong convergence rate of the euler scheme for the cev and cir processes , the existence or non - existence of moment explosions for approximation schemes of the heston model , how to prevent moment explosions ( if they happen ) by simple modifications of the scheme etc . and",
    "even if these questions are answered , the question remains whether there is a general theory for numerical methods for sdes from mathematical finance or do these sdes have to analysed one by one .",
    "so , the numerical analysis of sdes arising in finance will be still an active and challenging field of research in the future .",

    "<S> many stochastic differential equations that occur in financial modelling do not satisfy the standard assumptions made in convergence proofs of numerical schemes that are given in textbooks , i.e. , their coefficients and the corresponding derivatives appearing in the proofs are not uniformly bounded and hence , in particular , not globally lipschitz . </S>",
    "<S> specific examples are the heston and cox - ingersoll - ross models with square root coefficients and the ait - sahalia model with rational coefficient functions . </S>",
    "<S> simple examples show that , for example , the euler - maruyama scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense when the standard assumptions do not hold . </S>",
