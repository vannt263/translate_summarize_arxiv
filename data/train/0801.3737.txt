    "5(c ) and 8(c ) ) in the @xmath98-structural phase diagram compared to that observed in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "this leads to a significantly more abrupt field - induced transition in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 between the strongly jt distorted ( @xmath56 space group ) afm / coo phase ( purple region in fig .",
    "8(c ) ) and weakly jt distorted ( @xmath86 or @xmath20 space group ) fmm phase ( green region in fig .",
    "8(c ) ) .    to explain this behavior , we note first that earlier work on la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 by uehara et al . reported the coexistence of long - range fm domains and long - range coo domains for @xmath5@xmath8880 k and @xmath6=0 t , and the coexistence of short - range coo domains and short - range fm domains for 80@xmath88t@xmath88210 k and @xmath6=0 t.  @xcite accordingly , the dramatic difference between thermal and field - induced melting we observe in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 indicates that  by favoring fm domains at the expense of coo domains  applied magnetic fields are far more effective than thermal fluctuations at disrupting long - range coherence between coo domains and driving a coo / afm to fm transition , in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 .",
    "this description is consistent with the observed increase with temperature in the critical field @xmath94(@xmath5 ) at which la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 transitions from the coo / afm regime to the weakly jt distorted fm regime ( see fig .",
    "8(c ) ) : with increasing temperature , the size of the fm domains in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 is known to decrease to nanometer length scales ,  @xcite thereby creating more pm regions and a higher critical field needed to achieve a percolation transition of the fm domains in the fm `` weakly jt distorted '' phase .",
    "thus , we argue that field - induced melting of long - range coo is fundamentally different in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 and la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 : in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , field - induced melting of coo primarily proceeds by a gradual reduction of coo domain regions .",
    "by contrast , in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 , the more rapid field - induced melting of coo occurs via the enhancement of fm domain regions that are already present in the material  even at low temperatures and @xmath6=0 t  by pr - substitution .",
    "however , thermal melting in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 and la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 proceeds in the same fashion , namely by disrupting coo domain regions and increasing the volume of the pm phase .",
    "these results further suggest that griffiths phase models  @xcite may be appropriate descriptions of the disordered la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 system .",
    "the griffiths phase describes the behavior of a random magnetic system that is between the completely disordered and ordered magnetic phases ,  @xcite and was first used to describe a randomly dilute ising ferromagnet in the regime between the observed ( suppressed ) fm critical temperature @xmath99 and the critical temperature @xmath100 of the pure magnet ( i.e. , at which temperature the magnetization is non - analytic in an external field ) .",
    "@xcite this suppression of the critical temperature was associated in the griffiths phase with the effects of quenched disorder , which partition the pure system into small ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "there have been several recent studies that identify a griffiths phase in the manganites .",
    "@xcite in particular , we note that the @xmath5-@xmath44 phase diagram of la@xmath42sr@xmath43mno@xmath31 reported by deisenhofer et al . ,  @xcite in which a griffiths phase regime is identified , is quite similar to the @xmath5-@xmath36 phase diagram of la@xmath101pr@xmath34ca@xmath3mno@xmath31 ,  @xcite in which a coexistence regime of fm and co phases having different length scales is reported .",
    "indeed , based on this similarity , we can make a rough correspondence between the phases of la@xmath42sr@xmath43mno@xmath31 and la@xmath101pr@xmath34ca@xmath3mno@xmath31 .",
    "the correspondence between the phases observed in these materials is summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     therefore , we propose that the field- and temperature - dependent behavior observed in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 can be understood in the context of griffiths physics : in this picture , @xmath99 is dependent on the size of the ferromagnetic clusters introduced by disorder , i.e. , the cluster size scales with @xmath99 .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that the transition from coo to fm in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 can be readily induced by applying even relatively weak fields at low temperatures , where larger fm regions coexist with coo regions .",
    "further , the abrupt field - induced transition between coo and fm phases in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1which is in contrast to the more gradual transition observed in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1is naturally explained in this description as due to a percolation transition of the fm clusters , which can be associated with a non - analyticity of the magnetization in the griffiths model .",
    "@xcite however , we hasten to add that there has been no systematic theoretical study of the field - dependence of `` griffiths phase '' systems , and more theoretical study would be welcome to check the connection between the novel field - induced melting behavior observed in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 and that expected from griffiths phase physics .",
    "our detailed temperature- and magnetic - field - dependent raman study of the phase transitions in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 and la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 allows us to provide specific details regarding the various structural phases that accompany thermal and field - induced melting of coo in these materials . in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1",
    ", we have found that thermal melting exhibits three distinct temperature regimes : below 150 k , melting of coo occurs at the interface between large coherent coo regions ( @xmath56 space group ) , causing a reduction in the coo domain volume with increasing temperature , but maintaining the long - range coherence of coo domains .",
    "between 150@xmath89@xmath5@xmath89170 k , additional melting leads to the eventual collapse of long - range coo , and the evolution of a coexistence regime consisting of short - range coo ( @xmath56 space group ) domains and `` weakly jt distorted '' ( @xmath86 or @xmath20 space group ) regions . above 170 k ,",
    "coo domains are completely melted , leading to a weakly jt distorted ( @xmath86 or @xmath20 space group ) regime .",
    "this temperature - dependent evolution of the spectra is suggestive of a first - order `` electronic crystallization '' transition in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , with the kinetics in the coexistence region corresponding to the propagation of a phase front .",
    "the field - induced melting process of coo in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 is found to be quite similar to the thermal melting process , suggesting that field - induced melting of coo in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 is associated with a first - order quantum phase transition : the application of a magnetic field disrupts antiferromagnetic order preferentially at the surface of coo regions , giving rise to heterogeneous melting of the coherent long - range coo regions , and a three - stage field - dependent melting process : a low - field regime in which a long - range `` strongly jt distorted''/coo phase is present ; an intermediate - field regime in which strongly jt distorted / coo domain regions coexist with weakly jt distorted / fmm domain regions ; and finally a high - field regime in which a long - range `` weakly jt distorted''/fmm phase associated with either a @xmath86 or @xmath20 structure is present .",
    "this three - stage field - dependent melting process in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 is consistent with the three distinct structural phases identified by tyson et al .",
    "@xcite over a more limited temperature range . based on our results",
    ", we were able to obtain a complete phase diagram of la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 in the temperature range 6170 k and in the field range 09 t. notably , the similarity between thermal and field - induced melting in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 is reflected in critical field values , @xmath90between the long - range coo and intermediate `` coexistence '' regimes  and @xmath93between the intermediate `` coexistence '' and weakly jt distorted fmm regimes  that decrease roughly linearly with decreasing temperature at a rate of @xmath7@xmath280.2 t / k .",
    "further , our results suggest an approximate @xmath5=0 critical point of @xmath96=@xmath97@xmath730 t for la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , indicative of a very robust coo in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "to investigate the effects of disorder on commensurate coo in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , we also examined the la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 system .",
    "we found that while thermal melting in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 is not significantly different from that in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , field - induced melting in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 differs dramatically from that in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 : the application of a magnetic field in the former material is found to induce an abrupt transition from a long - range coo to a `` weakly jt distorted''/fm phase with a very narrow intermediate coexistence field regime , in contrast to a gradual transition observed in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the phase diagram deduced for la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 reveals that the critical field @xmath93 between coo and weakly jt distorted regimes increases from @xmath72 t at @xmath5=3.5 k to 4 t at @xmath5=130 k , in contrast to a linear decrease of the @xmath93 with decreasing temperature in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that disordering coo with pr - substitution does not appreciably affect temperature - dependent melting of coo , but does significantly affect the field - induced melting of coo .",
    "we argue that the magnetic field induced coherence between fm domains  which originate from the introduction of pr in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1accelerates the disruption of antiferromagnetic order in coo , and leads to a distinctly different process of field - induced melting of coo from that observed in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 . in particular , we argue that field - induced melting of coo in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 is best described as the percolation of fm domains introduced at @xmath6=0 t by pr - substitution , and we suggest the griffiths phase physics may be an appropriate theoretical model for describing the unusual temperature- and field - dependent transitions observed in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 .",

    "<S> we find that while thermal melting of coo in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 is quite similar to that in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , field - induced melting of coo in the two systems is quite different in several respects : the field - induced transition from the coo phase to the weakly jt - distorted / fm phase in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 is very abrupt , and occurs at significantly lower fields ( @xmath6@xmath72 t at @xmath5@xmath70 k ) than in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 ( @xmath6@xmath730 t at @xmath5=0 k ) ; the intermediate coexistence regime is much narrower in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 than in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 ; and the critical field @xmath8 increases with increasing temperature in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 , in contrast to the decrease in @xmath8 observed with increasing temperature in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 . to explain these differences </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that field - induced melting of coo in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 is best described as the field - induced percolation of fm domains , and we suggest that griffiths phase physics may be an appropriate theoretical model for describing the unusual temperature- and field- dependent transitions observed in la@xmath2pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath1 . </S>"
