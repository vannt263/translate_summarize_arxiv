    "in the last decade remarkable experiments were performed involving measurements and manipulations of states for a single or several nanoscopic josephson junctions ( jj ) which were consistently interpreted in terms of two level quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the main assumption in the theoretical analysis is that such a many - body mesoscopic system can be effectively treated as a quantum system of a single degree of freedom typically described by a large spin or nonlinear oscillator model .",
    "the standard construction of the quantum hamiltonian for different types of jjs is based on the formal quantization of the kirchhoff equation for the corresponding macroscopic circuit@xcite .",
    "another approach uses an effective picture of bose - einstein condensate which represents cooper pairs at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "more fundamental derivations based on path - integral techniques lead to essentially equivalent models as well@xcite .",
    "the simple representative of this class of single degree of freedom models is the following josephson hamiltonian describing the effects of coulomb repulsion and tunneling for a cooper pair box ( cpb)@xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are spin operators for the spin-@xmath3 such that the number of cooper pairs at equilibrium is close to @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the charging energy , @xmath5 is the josephson energy characterizing the tunneling magnitude , and @xmath6 is a control parameter .",
    "the obtained nonlinear hamiltonians yield the structure of two lowest energy levels which at the low enough temperatures can be separated from the others to form an effective _ macroscopic qubit_. in particular for the hamiltonian ( [ cpbham1 ] ) and under the condition @xmath7 these states are approximatively spanned by the eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the operator @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the main problem with such models is the presence of a typically strong and collective coupling to an environment .",
    "namely , it is expected that the observed states should be rather well - localized semiclassical ones ( like coherent states for the model ( [ cpbham1 ] ) ) , which seem to be the only relatively stable with respect to external noise@xcite .",
    "however , the semiclassical states for a model of small jjs are characterized by large charge fluctuations which are not observed in the experiments with cpbs .",
    "therefore , either environmental decoherence producing semiclassical states does not work for josephson qubits at the typical time scale of the experiments or the standard single degree of freedom model is not correct .",
    "the first alternative seems to be unlikely because the semiclassical character of observed states is confirmed in the recent experiments on atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a double - well potential@xcite .",
    "although this is a physically different system its mathematical description is the same as for the standard model of a cpb and given by the hamiltonian of the form ( [ cpbham1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we follow the second possibility and propose an essentially modified theoretical description of small jjs .    in sec .",
    "ii two basic approximations for the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) hamiltonian : bogoliubov - valatin model hamiltonian and the collective spin models are discussed .",
    "it is argued , that with the specific choice of model parameters different from the standard ones but consistent with phenomenology of superconductivity , the collective spin model better describes physics of small superconducting devices . in particular , this model predicts the existence of specific excitations called _ excited pairs _ which can be produced by the individual tunneling or scattering from the _ ground pair _ states .",
    "one should stress , that usually excited pairs are not considered in the literature on jjs , in contrast to the single electron / hole quasi - particles .",
    "moreover , in the standard derivation the collective character of scattering / tunneling is also assumed .    in sec .",

    "v to current biased junction ( cbj ) .",
    "the main feature is the appearance of the additional energy levels , among them highly degenerate ones .",
    "this level structure essentially modifies the _ qubit picture _ of small jjs and the dynamics of their relaxation .",
    "section vi is devoted to the comparison of predictions of the presented unifying microscopic model with experimental data for all types of superconducting qubits .",
    "the advantage of the presented theory is that the approximative formulas for the qubit frequencies contain less free parameters than the standard ones but nevertheless agree with the data .",
    "the simplest version of the hamiltonian that incorporates pairing interaction and reproduces not only the basic phenomenology of superconductivity@xcite but is successfully applicable to small superconducting grains@xcite is the following @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 here we denote by @xmath15 a single electron basis of pairs of time - reversed states enumerated by a discrete index @xmath16 and by @xmath17 , @xmath18 the associated set of fermionic annihilation and creation operators .",

    "although there exists a remarkable exact solution for this hamiltonian@xcite it is too complicated for our purposes . in",
    "the following we briefly discuss and compare two well known approximative schemes .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is to replace the hamiltonian ( [ bcs ] ) containing four - body interaction ( [ hred ] ) by a two - body ( mean - field ) one @xmath23 with the _ gap parameter _",
    "@xmath24 determined using a self - consistent averaging @xmath25 in particular one can put the model hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) into the expression for the thermal average to obtain the value of @xmath24 as the solution of the _",
    "gap equation_. it can be done because the hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) can be transformed to the form of the bogoliubov - valatin free hamiltonian for the _ quasi - particles _",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 , described by a set of new fermionic annihilation and creation operators @xmath28 being linear combinations of the old ones .",
    "the gap parameter @xmath29 can be chosen positive and the gap equation for the thermal average in the grand canonical ensemble determines the temperature dependence @xmath30 .",
    "one should notice that the gap equation makes sense only for the reference states with indefinite number of cooper pairs , like grand canonical ensemble or coherent - type states which display essentially normal fluctuations .",
    "the fundamental results of this theory are the relations between the critical temperature @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and the parameters of the model . in terms of the parametrization",
    "used here they read@xcite @xmath33 only the first relation has been tested in many experiments and found to be reasonable while the second one strongly depends on the unknown parameter @xmath34 .    as shown already by thirring and",
    "wehrl@xcite the predictions based on the model hamiltonian ( [ hfree ] ) become exact only in the thermodynamic limit for the grand canonical ensemble when the fluctuation terms of the order @xmath35 become negligible in comparison to the bulk terms proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , one can not expect that this model gives precise structure of few lowest lying energy levels in the case of mesoscopic samples with essentially fixed number of cooper pairs .      in the modern literature",
    "one usually identifies the cut - off frequency @xmath34 with the debye frequency @xmath37@xcite ( @xmath38 ) what due to ( [ gap1 ] ) implies @xmath39 in the original bcs paper@xcite the choice @xmath40 was suggested what implied that all relevant energy parameters of the model could be of the same order of magnitude @xmath41 the choice of @xmath34 determines important , although not directly measurable , quantities .",
    "the first one is the actual magnitude of the coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "the second one is the number of cooper pairs in the sample at zero temperature , given by the formula @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density of electronic states at the fermi surface ( spin is not counted ) .",

    "the are few heuristic arguments in favor of the choice ( [ gap3 ] ) :    1 .",
    "it implies that there is a single energy scale determining the superconducting phenomena given by the magnitude of the electron - phonon coupling , while the choice ( [ gap2 ] ) involves two quite different energy scales ( @xmath38 ) . in a general case of particle interaction mediated by bosons the cut - off in boson momentum",
    "@xmath45 influences the magnitude of interaction for interparticle distances @xmath46 . in the case of phonons",
    "this yields the distances @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the lattice constant ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` size '' of a cooper pair is at least two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath48 and hence the debye cut - off should not enter the effective interaction between cooper pairs in the bcs hamiltonian ( [ hred ] ) .",
    "2 .   for a normal state of a metal",
    "the approximative number of thermally excited electrons is @xmath49 while the others are `` frozen in a dirac sea '' .",
    "when the temperature decreases to the critical value @xmath31 , it is plausible to expect that only the @xmath50 excited electrons begin to form cooper pairs and the others remain `` frozen '' .",
    "finally , when the temperature approaches zero all of them recombine into cooper pairs .",

    "we argue that for the mesoscopic samples the structure of the lowest lying levels is reasonably well - described by the hamiltonian ( [ bcs1 ] ) with the kinetic part @xmath54 treated as a `` small '' perturbation of @xmath65 .",
    "this is consistent with the choice ( [ gap3 ] ) and implies the relatively low number of cooper pairs @xmath80 .    in the case of a small electrode ,",

    "these deviations are due to neglecting the kinetic energy term which , even in the regime ( [ gap3 ] ) , is still comparable to the pairing energy . nevertheless , the collective spin model possesses certain features which seem to reproduce better the physics of small superconductors at the temperatures much below the critical one and coupled to external fields .",
