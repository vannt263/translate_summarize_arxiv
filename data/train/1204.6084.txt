    "topological phases are often characterized by gapless boundary excitations which do not arise in the low - energy part of local lattice hamiltonians with the same dimension .",
    "for example , the integer / fractional quantum hall states support chiral edge excitations , which have only `` half '' the degrees of freedom as particles moving in a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "recently discovered topological insulators(ti ) with time - reversal(tr ) symmetry support gapless helical boundary states in both two and three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "these boundary states can be gapped out by adding certain symmetry - breaking perturbations(e.g .",
    "superconducting or magnetic order ) which in many cases leads to exotic phases .",
    "a notable example is the @xmath1 superconducting state created by superconducting proximity effect on the surface states of three - dimensional ti  @xcite which exhibits non - abelian majorana zero modes in vortices .",
    "similar physics can also be realized on the edges of two - dimensional quantum spin hall insulators  @xcite , where majorana zero modes appear at the interfaces between superconducting and magnetic gapped regions .",
    "the majorana zero modes exhibit unusual properties such as @xmath2-period josephson effect  @xcite and non - abelian statistics  @xcite , which have important application in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , strongly correlated topological phases , such as fractional quantum hall(fqh ) states  @xcite , are usually associated with the fractionalization of quantum numbers",
    ". it would be even more interesting to study the quantum phases originated from symmetry breaking in the fractionalized boundary states . in this paper",
    "we study superconducting proximity effect on the edge of two - dimensional fractional topological insulators ( fti )  @xcite , which can be regarded as the tr symmetric generalization of laughlin states with filling fraction @xmath3 .",
    "we focus on the properties of the gapless edge states of fti brought in contact with an s - wave superconductor .",
    "our main finding is that the electron fractionalization drastically changes the superconducting proximity effect on the edge states , as opposed to the non - interacting quantum spin hall insulators .",
    "most remarkably , domain walls between the superconducting and magnetic gapped regions are found to carry localized zero modes with quantum dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we also determine the operator algebra satisfied by the zero modes which can be regarded as a @xmath5 generalization of majorana fermions .",
    "we then argue that the zero modes exhibit non - abelian statistics upon adiabatic exchanging and determine the braiding matrices .",
    "we also discuss possible physical indications of the unusual zero modes and propose an unconventional josephson effect with period @xmath6 .",

    "we start by reviewing the effective edge theory of fti  @xcite . we mainly consider fti with @xmath7 conserved where the two spin species each form laughlin states with filling fraction @xmath3 where @xmath8 is an odd integer , under a spin - dependent magnetic field @xmath9 .",

    "the physical electron creation operators are given by @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is a regularization factor .",
    "notice that proper klein factors should be included in the expression to ensure the correct fermionic commutation relations but it turns out that they are not relevant for our discussion below , so we omit them to simpify the notations .",
    "we also omit the spin indices of the bosonic fields since they are locked to the chiral indices .",
    "we adopt the convention that under tr transformation @xmath33 to guarantee that @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , @xmath35 .",
    "one can also define @xmath36 which creates a charge @xmath37 quasiparticle(qp ) on the edge .",
    "the proximity effect of an s - wave superconductor can be taken into account by adding the following pairing term to the edge theory : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the induced superconducting gap and @xmath40 is the superconducting phase . using the bosonic representation ,",
    "we can write the pairing term as @xmath41    we first assume @xmath39 is a weak perturbation and study its fate using perturbative renormalization group(rg ) analysis . the flow of the coupling @xmath39 under rg is given by @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the dimensionless flow parameter .",
    "the pairing term is relevant when @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , in the `` non - interacting '' case",
    "@xmath25 the pairing is irrelevant .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the electron fractionalization .",
    "however , we should remark here that although the term is perturbatively irrelevant when @xmath46 , it can still gap out the edge luttinger liquid if the bare value of @xmath39 is large enough when the perturbative rg analysis breaks down .",
    "we now consider the gapped phase resulting from the mass term @xmath47 .",
    "we choose the gauge @xmath48 .",
    "semi - classically , @xmath49 is pinned to the minima of @xmath50 located at : @xmath51 therefore there are @xmath52 degenerate ground states which we denote by @xmath53 .",
    "we notice that when @xmath54 it reduces to the well - known topological degeneracy of one - dimensional majorana chain  @xcite .",
    "since under tr @xmath49 goes to @xmath55 , the semiclassical ground states @xmath53 are not tr invariant when @xmath56 .    however , it is important to realize that the one - dimensional system under consideration is already the boundary of a 2d system and thus it must be a closed manifold without any boundaries . if the whole edge is gapped out by the superconducting proximity effect , there is a unique ground state fixed by the boundary condition .",
    "the ground state degeneracy only occurs in an open geometry  @xcite . to effectively create boundaries on the edge , we need to introduce a different mass term , e.g. tr - breaking perturbations by applying zeeman field or proximity effect to a ferromagnetic insulator to gap out some regions of the edge liquid .",
    "[ fig : setup ] for an illustration of the setup . to be specific",
    ", we consider inducing ferromagnetic order in some region of the edge , by adding the following mass term to the hamiltonian : @xmath57 now consider a setup in which the edge is divided into @xmath58 segments , @xmath59 of which are gapped out by the superconducting proximity effect and the others by proximity to ferromagnets , arranged in an alternating order . from our semiclassical analysis ,",
    "each superconducting segment has @xmath52 ground states .",
    "superficially there would be totally @xmath60-fold degeneracy .",
    "however , due to the global conservation law of qp number mod @xmath52 ( see below ) , the degeneracy is actually reduced to @xmath61 . since the entire edge is gapped away from the interfaces between different regions , the ground state degeneracy can only arise from zero modes localized at the interfaces .",
    "because there are @xmath58 interfaces , each zero mode has a quantum dimension @xmath4 .    to understand the nature of the degenerate ground states , we notice that the total charge density on the edge is given by @xmath62 .",
    "its commutation relation with @xmath49 is @xmath63=\\frac{i\\pi}{m}\\delta(x - x')$ ] .",
    "therefore the following relation can be derived : @xmath64 here @xmath65 which counts the number of qp s residing on the edge .",
    "we can then linearly superpose @xmath66 to obtain eigenstates of @xmath67 : @xmath68 here @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath52 degenerate ground states have different mod @xmath52 qp number .",
    "this is analogous to the two - fold ground state degeneracy of a one - dimensional class d topological superconductor , distinguished by the global fermion parity . using the tr transformation of @xmath49",
    ", one can see that @xmath70 under tr .",
    "therefore except the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 , all other states are _ not _ tr invariant",
    ".    one may wonder whether the @xmath52-fold degeneracy is protected , and if that is the case , what physical property protects such degeneracy .",
    "first of all , the existence of gapless edge modes requires tr symmetry in the bulk of the fti  @xcite .",
    "given the tr symmetry , because the fti state is fully gapped , at energies well below the bulk gap , qp tunnelings through the bulk are highly suppressed .",
    "due to the fractional statistics of the qp in fti with statistical angle @xmath73 , any external physical perturbations must change the qp number of each species by @xmath8 since they have to be local with respect to electrons .",
    "this fact , together with the conservation of the total fermion parity in the gapped superconducting systems , implies an emergent conservation of qp numbers module @xmath52 on the edge .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy of the @xmath52 ground states with different qp numbers mod @xmath52 can not be lifted by any physical perturbations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath52-fold degeneracy is protected by the topological order in the bulk fti and the fermion parity conservation .",
    "in the previous section we use semiclassical analysis to study the ground state properties of the gapped phase . we argue that it is natural to relate the ground state degeneracy to localized zero modes on the sc - fm interfaces where the spectra gap has to close .",
    "heuristically , the zero modes are transformations between the ground states . in this section",
    "we put these considerations on a firmer ground by deriving an effective hamiltonian to describe the low - energy quantum fluctuations around the semiclassical ground states .",
    "first it will turn out to be convenient to regularize the bosonic hamiltonian on a lattice ( after proper rescaling of space ) : @xmath74 .",

    "we introduce a set of basis @xmath53 on each site and the first term @xmath79 becomes @xmath80 where the @xmath81 s have matrix representation @xmath82 which is simply the operator @xmath83 projected onto the low - energy sector .",
    "the @xmath84 term causes transitions between the @xmath85 states .",
    "we rewrite this term in the @xmath85 basis as ( on one site ) @xmath86 here the operator @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88 we now make the approximation to keep only the @xmath89 term in the sum : @xmath90 .",
    "this is justified in the limit of small fluctuations of @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath91 and @xmath87 form a @xmath52-dimensional representations of the weyl group algebra : @xmath92 so far we have succeeded in mapping the model to the @xmath52-states quantum potts model  @xcite : @xmath93    \\label{eqn : chiralpotts}\\ ] ] here @xmath94 .",
    "we now briefly discuss the symmetry of the potts model .",
    "the hamiltonian apparently has a global @xmath5 symmetry given by @xmath95 to see the physical meaning of the @xmath5 symmetry , it is useful to go to a `` dual '' basis @xmath96 on each site which are the eigenstates of @xmath59 . in this basis ,",
    "the global symmetry takes a very transparent form : @xmath97 which is nothing but the mod @xmath52 qp number we have mentioned in the previous section .",
    "a crucial property of the potts model is the self duality  @xcite , revealed by the duality transformation  @xcite : @xmath98 which maps @xmath99 into itself with @xmath100 up to an overal rescaling .",
    "we can use the results in [ ] to obtain the explicit form of the zero modes at the special solvable point @xmath101 . notice the product of the original variable and the neighbouring dual variable @xmath102 satisfies the following algebra : @xmath103 for @xmath54 this is just the algebra of majorana fermions .",
    "we call the zero modes @xmath104 s which satisfy as @xmath5 zero modes . using this result",
    ", the original model can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath105 operators  @xcite : @xmath106 the explicit expression of the @xmath104 s in terms of the original variables are given below : @xmath107 which generalizes the jordan - wigner transformation for fermions .",
    "notice that we have multiplied a phase factor @xmath108 to make sure that @xmath109 .    for a finite chain with sites starting at @xmath110 and ending at @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "are decoupled from the hamiltonian at @xmath114 , similar to kitaev s majorana chain model  @xcite .",
    "one can also check that @xmath115 commute with all other terms in the hamiltonian . in terms of the original bosons ,",
    "the two zero modes are expressed as @xmath116 when @xmath117 , the model in general can not be solved exactly . however , since when @xmath114 the bulk is fully gapped , one can imagine slowly turning on a small but finite @xmath118 without closing the bulk gap",
    ". the finite @xmath118 phase should be adiabatically connected to the gapped phase of the fti edge theory . during this adiabatic evolution ,",
    "the zero modes are renormalized but remains localized as long as the bulk gap is not closed .",
    "in particular , we expect the relation holds true at least in the low - energy sector .",
    "we also identify from @xmath119 again we expect it to be valid universally in the gapped phase .",
    "we derive the expression of the zero modes @xmath105 within the low - energy effective hamiltonian which takes a non - local form with a string operator attached",
    ". one may wonder whether they are local objects in terms of the qp operators of the fti edge theory .",
    "let us remark that the local fields @xmath81 and @xmath120 in the effective hamiltonian are themselves non - local in the original edge theory . although a formal proof is lacking at this stage , we believe it is highly likely the zero modes are _ local _ in terms of the quasiparticle operators .",
    "we now discuss the braiding statistics of the @xmath5 zero modes . we need to specify what braiding means for the zero modes localized at the domain walls in one dimension . in a closely related context",
    ", it has been recently demonstrated  @xcite that majorana zero modes in one - dimensional wires can be adiabatically exchanged either by forming networks out of the wires and moving the majorana zero modes using the `` t''-junction geometry , or by a series of qp tunneling processes .",
    "the non - abelian braiding statistics resulting from these operations takes the same form as the one of the majorana fermions in two - dimensional @xmath1 superconductors up to an undetermined overall phase .",
    "this paves the way to perform topological quantum computing in quantum wires .",
    "there is no fundamental difficuties in exploiting these ideas to the situations at hand and therefore we can discuss the braiding of @xmath5 zero modes .    in the following discussion ,",
    "we derive possible forms of the braiding matrix based on general principles without appealing to details of the implementation of braidings .",
    "we will extensively use the language of the algebraic theory of anyons ( namely , modular tensor category theory ) and assume that the braiding matrices of the zero modes satisfy some of the basic relations originally developed for anyons in topological phases in two dimensions  @xcite . whether this description applies to quasi - one - dimensional objects as those considered here is not justified _ a priori_. it is an important question to clarify the relationship between the anyon model at hand and the modular tensor category theory describing two - dimensional topological phases .",
    "the information we need is the fusion algebra of the anyons as well as the monodromy equation relating the braiding matrices to the topological spins of the particles .",
    "we start from the fusion algebra of the @xmath5 zero modes .",
    "there are @xmath121 types of particles , denoted by @xmath122 where @xmath123 . here",
    "@xmath124 is the vacuum .",
    "the nontrivial part of the fusion algebra is given by @xmath125 here @xmath126 represents the @xmath5 zero mode and @xmath127 is the state with @xmath59 qps , which are abelian with quantum dimension @xmath128 .",
    "the vaccum fuses trivially with everything else .",
    "the fusion of two @xmath126 s follows straightforwardly from the topological ground state degeneracy discussed in sec .",
    "the fusion of @xmath129 particles follows from the fact that they are labeled by the number of qp s mod @xmath52 in the superconducting segment of the fti edge , and thus naturally form a @xmath5 structure .    using the language of modular tensor category , we have the following basis data from the fusion algebra : @xmath130 we have already counted the quantum dimensions of the anyons : @xmath131 .",
    "now let us consider braiding a pair of @xmath126 particles labeled as @xmath128 and @xmath132 and for simplicity we assume that physically they belong to the same topological segment . as discussed in the previous analysis",
    ", such a segment has in fact only one ground state within a given mod @xmath52 qp number sector .",
    "this translates into the one - dimensionality of the fusion space as given in .",
    "therefore the result of an adiabatic exchange is essentially abelian : the ground states in different mod @xmath52 qp number sector can not mix and each acquires an abelian berry phase .",
    "let us assume that the ground state with mod @xmath52 qp number @xmath59 acquires a phase @xmath133 . in more abstract terms , the @xmath134-matrix encoding the effects of braiding @xmath135 is actually one - dimensional since @xmath136 . choosing a proper normalization , it is exactly the phase factor @xmath137 .    without knowing how the braidings are implemented",
    ", one can actually determine the @xmath134-matrix to a large extent using the monodromy equation in our case when fusion spaces are all one - dimensional .",
    "the operation of two consecutive braidings , being equivalent to moving one anyon around another , is termed as a monodromy .",
    "it is known that the monodromy is fully characterized by the topological spins of the anyons . using the fusion algebra",
    ", we have the following relation between the @xmath134-matrix and the topological spins of the anyons @xmath126 and @xmath127  @xcite : @xmath138 to figure out the topological spin of @xmath127 , we notice that @xmath127 can be regarded as a composite of @xmath59 qp .",
    "each qp , being an abelian anyon in a @xmath139 laughlin fqh liquid , has topological spin @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "thus the topological spin @xmath142 .",
    "@xcite since @xmath143 , we find @xmath144 therefore , we have determined @xmath137 up to a global phase @xmath145 .",
    "this result is derived from very general consideration and should be independent of the implementations of the braiding operations .",
    "one can see that if @xmath54 and @xmath146 , gives the well - known berry phases for the even and odd parity ground states of two majorana zero modes  @xcite if we choose all the unspecified sign factors in to be @xmath128 .",
    "we go on to consider four zero modes @xmath147 arranged such that @xmath148 for @xmath149 .",
    "we assume that @xmath150 and @xmath151 belong to the same topological segment and the same to @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "naturally we choose the fock basis formed by the degenerate ground states of the two segments , labeled by mod @xmath52 qp number @xmath154 : @xmath155 .",
    "braiding @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( or @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) just generates a abelian phase on the fock states .",
    "the nontrivial one is braiding @xmath151 and @xmath152 which belong to different topological segments .",
    "to derive the non - abelian berry phase acting on the ground state manifold , we make use of the @xmath5 conservation of qp number . after braiding",
    ", the qp number @xmath156 as well as @xmath157 should remain the same .",
    "this implies that if one rotates the fock basis to one in which @xmath158 becomes diagonal , the braiding results in an abelian berry phase as discussed above .",
    "then one can unwind the basis transformation to obtain the braiding matrix in the original basis .",
    "similar procedure can be carried out for any @xmath58 zero modes , although our method for determining the braid matrix quickly becomes very inefficient .",
    "so far our discussion of braiding has been general . a realistic scheme could possibly be developed exploiting the idea of measurement - only topological quantum computation  @xcite , in which braidings are carried out by a series of measurements of the fusion outcomes for pairs of anyons in the presence of additional topological qubits that are properly initialized .",
    "in this section we discuss the manifestation of the topological degeneracy in josephson transport .",
    "we show that the josephson current has a period of @xmath6 , thus generalizing the @xmath2 josephson effect in topological superconductor  @xcite .",
    "before we proceed , it is useful to understand the gauge transformation on the state @xmath96 . assuming that we change the phase @xmath40 by @xmath159 : @xmath160 , then @xmath161 .",
    "therefore @xmath162 , implying @xmath163 .    in terms of the localized modes",
    ", we can write down the general form of the effective hamiltonian in the tunneling regime to leading order in the tunneling amplitude @xmath164 : @xmath165 here @xmath166 and @xmath167 are localized zero modes at the two ends of the junction .",
    "notice that here it is crucially important that the josephson current is carried by quasiparticles instead of electrons .",
    "although the junction is gapped out by tr - breaking field ( e.g. ferromagnet ) , it is still part of the fractional quantum spin hall fluid .",
    "since they carry charge @xmath37 , the period of the josephson current should become @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we will provide a more rigorous calculation of the @xmath6 period of the josephson current .",
    "the dc josephson current is then given by @xmath168 .",
    "\\label{}\\ ] ] here @xmath169 is the conserved mod @xmath52 qp number .",
    "therefore the periodicity of @xmath170 is completely determined by the periodicity of the phase - dependent coupling @xmath171 .",
    "now we consider the coupling @xmath171 .",
    "we assume a gauge choice in which superconducting phase to the left of the junction is fixed and the the phase on the right is @xmath40 .",
    "now we increase the superconducting phase by @xmath159 : @xmath160 . as we just demonstrate , the zero modes @xmath172 .",
    "equivalently , this extra phase factor can be absorbed into the coupling @xmath173 : @xmath174 consequently , the josephson current @xmath175 ,    \\label{}\\ ] ] which is in general different from @xmath176 .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath176 to return to its initial value , @xmath40 has to advance by @xmath6 since @xmath177 .",
    "so in summary we have derived that @xmath178 although we have not determined the precise functional dependence of @xmath176 , it is sufficient to conclude that the josephson current has a period @xmath6 .",
    "we now briefly discuss the ac josephson effect .",
    "the conventional ac josephson current at finite voltage @xmath87 has frequency @xmath179 . in our case , since the josephson current is transported by a single fractionalized qp , the ac josephson current has frequency @xmath180 . when the josephson junction is irradiated by microwaves with frequency @xmath181 , the shapiro steps in dc current are observed at @xmath182 , i.e. we only see shapiro steps at multiples of @xmath52 .",
    "however , the missing steps are filled in by higher - order tunneling terms in the junction . a recent proposal of a three - leg shapiro - step measurement",
    "may also be adopted here to overcome this obstacle  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the exotic gapped phase formed on the edge of fti under superconducting proximity effect .",
    "this phase is characterized by topological degeneracy determined by the electron fractionalization .",
    "the degenerate ground states are distinguished by the mod @xmath52 qp number .",
    "we relate the degeneracy to @xmath5 zero modes on the boundary of the fractionalized topological superconducting region .",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian to describe low - energy physics which maps to a quantum potts model and allows for explicit construction of the zero modes .",
    "we then discuss the braiding of these zero modes .",
    "we also propose fractional josephson effect as a signature of this unusual phase",
    ".    it will be very interesting to work out the complete algebraic description of the non - abelian excitations found in this work , in the framework of tensor category theory .",
    "one may wonder , based on the relation to the chiral potts model , that the zero modes discussed in this work can be regarded as one - dimensional analog of @xmath5 parafermions arising in , e.g. read - rezayi fractional quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "however , as non - abelian anyons , they have apparently different fusion rules and braiding statistics and therefore should not be confused with each other .",
    "it is indeed true that both of them have close relation to @xmath5 clock models .",
    "the wavefunctions of parafermionic fractional quantum hall states are constructed from the correlation functions in parafermion conformal field theory  @xcite which describes the critical point of certain @xmath5-symmetric statistical model .",
    "the zero modes studied in this work are related to the ordered phase of chiral potts model . in both cases ,",
    "the zero modes and parafermions are expressed by the order and disorder variables of a @xmath5-symmetric model  @xcite .",
    "however , they should be placed properly in very different phases of the model .",
    "we also notice that non - abelian anyons with quantum dimension @xmath183 where @xmath184 have been found as lattice dislocations in @xmath185 gauge theory  @xcite and also lattice fractional quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "the topological field theory of non - abelian phases containing these anyons has not been found .",
    "some candidates include the @xmath186 chern - simons theory  @xcite and a @xmath187 chern - simons theory studied by barkeshli and wen  @xcite may be relevant in this context .",
    "we now discuss possible future directions .",
    "we have considered the edge states of 2d fti .",
    "a natural question is whether the approach taken in this work can be generalized to fractional topological insulators in three dimensions  @xcite the surface states of which are fractionalized , helical non - fermi liquid .",
    "in contrast to the 2d case where at least theoretically the existence of fti has been firmly established , in 3d the situation becomes much more complicated and so far apart from one exactly solvable model  @xcite , other attempts are all based on parton constructions and gauge theories .",
    "however , one could expect that superconducting proximity effect on such exotic surface states would lead to very interesting phenomena .",
    "in particular , one can suspect that there may be unusual zero modes localized in the cores of superconducting @xmath188 vortices .    _ note added . _ upon finishing the manuscript we become aware of several preprints  @xcite on closely related topics .",
