    "the physics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene monolayers has been intensely studied over the past decade , for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a noteworthy recent development in this field is that the ballistic transport regime ( with mean free paths beyond tens of @xmath2 m ) has become accessible , for instance , by using ultraclean suspended samples @xcite or by encapsulating graphene layers in boron nitride crystals @xcite .",
    "we here consider the electronic properties of graphene @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "this system has attracted considerable attention , and many reports of interesting experimental transport studies have already appeared @xcite . in such setups ,",
    "the gapless dirac fermion spectrum of low - energy quasiparticles in graphene @xcite allows for the controlled electron or hole doping of parts of the sample by backgate voltage changes .",
    "we mention in passing that one may also fabricate high - quality @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions in graphene by the controlled diffusion of metallic contacts @xcite .",
    "early experiments have reported a fractional quantization of the conductance across the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction @xcite .",
    "an explanation for this phenomenon is possible by taking into account chiral interface states propagating along the junction . for sufficiently disordered samples",
    ", their existence allows for a simple physical picture of the observed conductance quantization @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", experiments have approached the ballistic regime @xcite , thereby realizing gate - controlled electron waveguides .    motivated by the above developments , we here theoretically study chiral interface states for ballistic bipolar junctions of 2d dirac fermions in a perpendicular homogeneous @xmath3 field .",
    "such states have been analyzed on the semiclassical level in refs .",
    "the corresponding trajectories involve skipping orbits combined with snake - type motions along the interface .",
    "this can be rationalized by noting that ( i ) in electron vs hole doped regions , cyclotron orbits have different orientation sense , and that ( ii ) klein tunneling allows for a finite probability @xmath4 of an impinging particle to cross the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction , where @xmath5 depends on the incidence angle @xmath6 @xcite . with probability @xmath7 ,",
    "the particle is thus reflected back into the same region , resulting in the skipping motion of a conventional edge state . with probability @xmath5",
    ", however , the particle enters the other side according to snell s law of negative refraction @xcite .",
    "the cyclotron orbit is now traversed in opposite direction , and one obtains a snaking motion along the junction .",
    "semiclassical trajectories are in general composed of stochastic sequences of these elementary skipping / snaking units @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the case of normal incidence ( @xmath8 ) , where a pure snake motion is possible since klein tunneling becomes perfect .",
    "recent experiments have reported evidence for this limit by injecting quasiparticles into the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction from edge states perpendicular to the interface @xcite . while some aspects of the quantum mechanical spectrum for a straight junction have been discussed in refs .",

    "[ fig1 ] , namely for a straight and for a circularly symmetric junction .",
    "the latter case is closely related to recent experiments , where circular junctions have been created by direct gating @xcite , by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) tips @xcite , or by local manipulation of defect charges in the substrate @xcite . using the established stm resolution capabilities in both space and energy",
    ", experiments could monitor the eigenstates of this system in full detail , cf .  also ref .",
    "@xcite . for a circular @xmath0-@xmath1 junction with @xmath11 ,",
    "such stm results have already been reported @xcite , but to observe the chiral interface states of interest here , one needs to consider finite @xmath3 . by superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) microscopy @xcite , local current densities can be detected as well .",
    "this method may provide direct access to the equilibrium ring currents expected in the circular geometry due to interface states .",
    "we emphasize that all predictions below can be tested with existing experimental setups . apart from graphene",
    ", our results may also apply to the dirac fermion surface states of topological insulators , cf .",
    "let us also mention that in @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath0 or @xmath1-@xmath0-@xmath1 devices , exotic non - fermi - liquid states are possible when electron - electron interactions between counterpropagating chiral interface states are taken into account @xcite .",

    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "focussing on the level closest to zero energy , as @xmath80 increases , one interpolates between @xmath96 landau states shifted by @xmath120 on different sides of the junction , see eq .  , passing through chiral interface states with negative group velocity .",
    "these states are unidirectional , propagate only along the negative @xmath35-axis , and are centered near the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction at @xmath65 . at the same time , interface states are also visible at higher energy scales , where they are formed from @xmath121 bands . for larger @xmath89 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , narrower and narrower anticrossings separate regions of approximately linear dispersion originating from different bands . therefore ,",
    "as @xmath80 changes , one can identify a single chiral interface mode that evolves through a sequence of avoided crossings , where the band index @xmath1 changes along the way .",
    "this mode is indicated by the red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "while the slope of the higher - energy part of the mode dispersion is approximately constant , we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the corresponding velocity @xmath122 ( oriented along the negative @xmath35-axis ) is slightly bigger than the velocity @xmath123 observed near @xmath86 .",
    "of course , this interface mode is not a true eigenstate for all @xmath80 .",
    "however , since the avoided crossings become very narrow , such a mode effectively represents eigenstates except for @xmath80-values near those anticrossings .",
    "this scenario also applies to larger values of @xmath89 , where more chiral interface modes can be identified , see fig .",

    "for the shown @xmath80 values , the latter states would be centered at @xmath126 and @xmath127 , i.e. , further away and even on the other side of the interface .",
    "interestingly , the result for @xmath128 resembles the ( strongly displaced ) probability density of a landau state with @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) confirms that this state continuously evolves to the @xmath96 shifted landau level in eq .   when following its energy dispersion all the way to @xmath129 .",
    "a similar observation holds true for the other @xmath80-values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which evolve to higher ( @xmath130 ) landau levels at @xmath129 through a series of @xmath131 avoided crossings .",
    "note that the central chiral interface mode , which passes through @xmath84 and is highlighted as red dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , corresponds to @xmath132 for the shown wavenumber @xmath133 .",
    "next we recall that for given @xmath89 within the bounds in eq .  , @xmath110 modes cross the @xmath86 line . from the shown numerical results ,",
    "we infer that the dispersion relation for all these modes is linear at sufficiently low energy scales . for @xmath82 , on top of the central chiral interface state which is always present , we observe that a pair of states reaches @xmath86 at finite wavenumbers @xmath134 . at low energies ,",
    "those states are formed from @xmath98 bands , where for @xmath135 , the @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) shifted landau energy moves above ( below ) zero energy for @xmath129 ( @xmath138 ) , cf .",
    ". furthermore , for @xmath83 , eq .   predicts @xmath139 zero - energy crossings as confirmed by fig .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical analysis of unidirectional interface states which form near @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions in a graphene monolayer subject to a homogeneous magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the semiclassical limit of these states corresponds to trajectories propagating along the @xmath0-@xmath1 interface by a combined skipping - snaking motion . </S>",
    "<S> studying the two - dimensional dirac equation with a magnetic field and an electrostatic potential step , we provide and discuss the exact and essentially analytical solution of the quantum - mechanical eigenproblem for both a straight and a circularly shaped junction . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum consists of localized landau - like and unidirectional snaking - skipping interface states , where we always find at least one chiral interface state . for a straight junction and at energies near the dirac point , when increasing the potential step height , the group velocity of this state interpolates in an oscillatory manner between the classical drift velocity in a crossed electromagnetic field and the semiclassical value expected for a purely snaking motion . </S>",
    "<S> away from the dirac point , chiral interface states instead resemble the conventional skipping ( edge - type ) motion found also in the corresponding schrdinger case . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the circular geometry , where chiral interface states are predicted to induce sizeable equilibrium ring currents . </S>"
