    "the family of sodium cobalt oxyhydrates or oxides ( cobaltites ) na@xmath3coo@xmath1  ( with x varying from 0.7 to 0.3 ) attracted a great deal of attention recently after the discovery of superconductivity around 5  k in the x@xmath40.3 compound @xcite .",
    "though there are several clear differences in crystal structure and electronic structure between cobaltites and high  -  _ t@xmath5 _  cuprates both systems have layered structure with electronic two - dimensionality , and typical strong electron correlations of a doped mott insulator .",
    "moreover , the triangular lattice of cobaltites induces spin frustration and hence may lead to anderson s rvb state @xcite that can also result in a non - s - wave order parameter @xcite .",
    "low temperature ferromagnetic fluctuations observed in cobaltites may lead to a p  -  wave superconducting state@xcite .",
    "in addition , the cobaltite with @xmath6 , being the host compound for the family of lower @xmath7 , demonstrates its own unusual physical properties like linear rise of resistivity with temperature up to 100  k,@xcite no saturation of the anomalous hall signal up to 500  k , and extraordinary high and magnetic field dependent thermopower@xcite .",
    "hence , the details of complete fermi surface topology and of quasiparticle dynamics are highly desirable for understanding the unconventional physics of this promising class of materials .",
    "this work reports such direct measurements performed by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on the host compound na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "single crystals of na@xmath0coo@xmath1  prepared by the flux method @xcite were kept under dry nitrogen gas and screened by x  -  ray diffraction in laue geometry .",
    "arpes experiments were carried out with scienta analyzers at the advanced light source beamlines 7.0.1 and 12.0.1 .",
    "photon energy covered 30  ev - 90  ev range with energy resolution better than 30  mev .",
    "the complete fermi surface topology was measured in the image mode of the programmable three - axis goniometer at the `` electronic structure factory '' endstation of beamline 7.0.1 .",
    "fermi surface areas close to principal symmetry points were also obtained independently from a set of energy spectra for different angles of incidence and emission .",
    "multi - angle mode allowed acquisition of energy spectra in @xmath8 wide emission angle window with an angular resolution better than 1@xmath9 of the brillouin zone ( bz ) . to obtain clean and flat surface ,",
    "samples were cleaved under ultra - high vacuum of @xmath10  torr or better at 16  k.     valence band of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 : ( a ) and ( b ) intensity plots along @xmath2  -  m and @xmath2  -  k lines respectively ; both images obtained with 65  ev photons , curves are the lda results from,@xcite ( c ) averaged energy dispersion curve ( edc ) for @xmath2  -  k orientation obtained with 90  ev photons showing correlation satellite at around 11  ev .",

    "the valence band dispersions along @xmath2  -  k and @xmath2  -  m principal symmetry lines follow the general trends of lda calculations @xcite including energy positions , widths , and dispersion of recognized features at binding energies around 0.7  ev , 3.0  ev , 4.1  ev , 6.0  ev , and the width of the density of states of about 7  ev as shown in fig-1(a ) and fig-1(b ) respectively",
    ". some bands may be less visible due to photon energy and polarization dependence of the matrix elements@xcite .",
    "a well defined peak is also observed at higher binding energies around 11  ev as show in fig-1(c ) .",
    "its resonant enhancement near 3p @xmath11 3d excitation together with the photon energy dependence of the fano  -  type interference are shown in fig-2 and allow to identify it as a correlation satellite that arises from strong on - site coulomb interaction and is consistent with cluster calculations with strong hubbard  -  _",

    "the shape of the fermi surface at 16  k is established to be an anisotropic hexagonal - like hole - pocket centered around the @xmath2  -  point as shown in fig-3 @xcite in agreement with lda calculations@xcite by integrating spectral weight from 75  mev below fermi level ( e@xmath13 ) to 25  mev above it with 90  ev photons . in disagreement with these calculations ,",
    "no small satellite pockets are observed around the central one .",
    "this may reflect strong electron correlations that may drive the minority bands out of e@xmath13 .",
    "the size of the central pocket is @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "intensity plot and energy dispersive curves ( edcs ) near e@xmath13 crossing along @xmath2  -  m and @xmath2  -  k symmetry lines are presented in fig-4 .",
    "these images were collected from the very same sample during the same experimental run and conditions following only @xmath16 azimuthally rotation .",
    "the quasiparticle feature strongly depends on the momentum ( * k * ) .",
    "its spectral weight being well defined only in the limited area of the bz may be explained by drastic lifetime shortening on departure from fermi level similar to the case of cuprates and other correlated systems . for both principal orientations",
    "this quasiparticle feature disperses only slightly , overall hardly more than 100  mev .",
    "thus , it is at least five times narrower than for the cuprates which is an order of magnitude renormalization from the mean field calculations @xcite and hence may be responsible for an order of magnitude enhancement of thermopower @xcite and electronic specific heat @xcite . along",
    "both principal symmetry lines it crosses fermi surface in the same direction - from the bz boundary toward @xmath2  -  point , giving the negative sign of the nearest neighbor single particle hopping _ t_. the quasiparticle ( occupied ) bandwidth is about @xmath17  mev . the value of _ t _ can be estimated from tight - binding approximation and for the lattice with hexagonal symmetry ( bandwidth = 9__t _ _ ) leads to @xmath18  mev .",
    "such small values imply a very small fermion degeneracy temperature in comparison with normal metals .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these values are of the same order as exchange coupling @xmath19  mev for the compounds of this family @xcite and hence , charge motion might be strongly perturbed by the spin fluctuations .",
    "na@xmath0coo@xmath20 has small fermi velocity less than @xmath4 0.3 ev@xmath21 , which can be estimated from edc and momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) as well .",
    "this value is almost 6 times smaller than the nodal fermi velocity for the cuprates of 1.8  ev@xmath21 , which is in agreement with much wider dispersion of the cuprate quasiparticle bands @xcite .",

    "we performed temperature dependent measurements of the spectral weight near e@xmath13 presented in fig-5 .",
    "on raising temperature quasiparticle weight steadily decreases up to about 120  k , where it becomes indistinguishable from the background .",
    "extrapolation to zero places the temperature value to around 150k .",
    "similar behavior is observed by cooling the samples .",
    "this temperature roughly matches the crossover region where resistivity changes its temperature dependence from linear at lower temperatures to a much steeper one shown in fig-5(c ) @xcite .",
    "quasiparticle transport property may be connected to the inherently frustrated nature of local antiferromagnetic interactions in a triangular lattice as the strength of the exchange interactions _",
    "j _ and single - particle hopping _",
    "t _ are of the same order .",
    "it is interesting to note that this temperature scale is also relevant to peculiarities of hall coefficient and thermopower @xcite .",
    "such a low energy scale present in a variety of physical properties of this compound still lacks proper theoretical explanation .",

    "in summary , we observed a number of electronic features that indicate the existence of strong coulomb correlations in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 : intense valence band satellites , a highly renormalized quasiparticle band near fermi level and the existence of quasiparticle coherence only below 150k . the small low energy scales for the effective single - particle hopping _",
