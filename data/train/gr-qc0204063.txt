    "since the early days of special relativity , the isotropy of the speed of light was considered as conventional , and related to the synchronization convention of distant clocks .",
    "the discussion was revived in the last decades by a controversial experimental test of the isotropy of the speed of light @xcite and by arguments which showed the privileged status of the einstein synchronization convention over other conventions @xcite . on the other side",
    ", some authors @xcite reconsidered those results proving the independence of the laws of physics from the synchronization convention ( simultaneity convention ) adopted , and the existence of a set of conventions alternative to the isotropic one . along these lines",
    ", it was shown that the causal structure of minkowski spacetime follows solely from the constancy of the speed of light over closed paths @xcite .",
    "this provided new confidence on the local minkowski nature of the spacetime manifold , and suggested how to make statements without relying on synchronization conventions .",
    "the strategy was to connect convention - free quantities ( i.e. independent of the synchronization convention ) , like the two - way speed of light , to convention - free quantities , like the causal structure .",
    "this convention - free approach will prove to be useful in more general situations .",
    "leaving inertial frames in special relativity things become far more clear . in general",
    "it becomes impossible even to synchronize distant clocks using the einstein synchronization convention and hence no question arises on its predominance over other conventions .",
    "one can not avoid the arbitrariness of the choice of a global synchronization .",
    "a formalism would be welcome if it is able to provide quantities independent of the synchronization convention adopted .",
    "this formalism is that of gauge theories .",
    "the aim of this work is to fix completely the parallelism between conventionality of simultaneity and gauge theories .",
    "the need for a gauge formalism was already noticed @xcite . here , a coherent exposition in light of ehresmann s theory of connections @xcite is given .",
    "it has the great advantage of unifying old and new results ( see eq .  ( [ bianchi ] ) and its interpretation as a bianchi identity ) in a common formalism which provides new insights on the geometry of spacetime .",
    "we start with stationary frames in general relativity .",
    "our conclusions will have straightforward specializations in usual contexts like the rotating platform in special relativity or the kerr metric in general relativity .",
    "then we study simultaneity in non - stationary frames showing that it is still described by a gauge theory in a generalized sense already developed by mathematicians @xcite .",
    "the derivation is short but needs at least some notions of differential geometry of principal fiber bundles @xcite .",
    "we shall use the conventions of kobayashi and nomizu @xcite apart from the wedge product that here is fixed by @xmath0 . the spacetime metric has signature ( + - - - ) .",
    "in everyday experience we deal with reference frames extended over large scales . on the earth s surface ,",
    "physics laboratories communicate to each other considering themselves at rest with respect to the same global reference frame .",
    "such a situation is very different from the local inertial reference frame that can be constructed in the neighborhood of a given free falling , non rotating , observer .",
    "there , locally , the usual minkowski spacetime is recovered and the euclidean spatial metric ( that experienced by rods at rest with respect to the observer ) is derived as the projection of the spacetime metric over the simultaneity slice , where the simultaneity of events is defined by the einstein convention .",
    "things change when a large number of observers are brought together to form an extended reference frame .",
    "for instance , the einstein simultaneity convention is unsuited for rotating systems because clocks can not be synchronized in that way all around a closed path .",
    "the spatial metric can no more be defined as the projection of the spacetime metric over the simultaneity slice because the einstein synchronization convention , in general , does not work in the large and , therefore , such a slice does not exist .",
    "hence , the spatial metric needs a more general definition ( see section [ section ] ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be the spacetime manifold of metric @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a time - like killing vector field .",
    "we shall say that a body is at rest with respect to the stationary frame if its worldline is an integral line of the killing vector field .",
    "its four - velocity is ( we shall use the symbol @xmath4 also to denote the 1-form @xmath5 ; its meaning will be clear from the context ) @xmath6 let @xmath7 be the one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by the killing vector field and let @xmath8 be the corresponding parameter , @xmath9 .",
    "the previous definition identifies a point of space of the stationary frame with an integral curve of the killing vector field , hence the `` space '' is defined by @xmath10 that is , as the quotient space of @xmath1 under the action of the lie group @xmath11 . here ,",
    "we recognize , at least locally , all the ingredients of a principal fiber bundle : @xmath1 is the principal bundle , @xmath11 is the structure group and @xmath12 is the base .",
    "we need only to define the right action of @xmath13 on @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 sends an event to its evolution after a killing time @xmath8 .",
    "the fiber @xmath17 over @xmath18 is given by the integral line identified with @xmath19 , and we shall refer to it also as the worldline of @xmath19 . for definiteness it is assumed that the projection @xmath20 of the bundle onto the base is differentiable .",
    "finally , the principal bundle is trivial because its structure group , the group of translations in one - dimension , is contractible @xcite",
    ".    the systematic construction of the gauge theory would be complete if we could provide a 1-form @xmath21 ( the connection ) on @xmath1 , with the following properties @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the pullback of @xmath16 .",
    "this is accomplished by the choice @xmath24 statement ( a ) follows trivially from substitution and statement ( b ) from the invariance of ( [ connessione ] ) under translations : @xmath25 . in a given event @xmath26 , the tangent space @xmath27 splits in two parts , the vertical space @xmath28 generated by the killing vector field , and the horizontal space @xmath29 orthogonal to it : @xmath30 .",
    "let us investigate more closely the physical meaning of this gauge theory .",
    "an observer at rest in the stationary frame can define , in his neighborhood , a simultaneity slice in compliance with the einstein synchronization convention .",
    "the coordinates obtained following the einstein convention , even for events far away from the worldline , are known as mrzke - wheeler coordinates @xcite .",
    "here we are interested only in the trivial result that the worldline is indeed orthogonal to the simultaneity slices .",
    "this result should be expected because it is a local statement that holds in special relativity .",
    "at least locally this means , as it was emphasized by robb @xcite , that the einstein convention corresponds to taking as simultaneous with @xmath14 those events in a neighborhood of @xmath26 that lie in the exponential map of the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 . from this",
    "we see that the horizontal space @xmath29 identifies those events which are simultaneous with @xmath26 with respect to an observer at rest in the stationary frame and placed in @xmath31 . in the following",
    "we shall refer to @xmath21 as the poincar connection , because poincar @xcite was the first who defined the synchronization convention that , later , was named after einstein .",
    "let @xmath32 be a curve on @xmath12 .",
    "the observers , all along @xmath33 , synchronize the neighboring clocks using the einstein synchronization convention . given an event @xmath34 , @xmath35 , they find a curve @xmath36 of simultaneous events .",
    "the procedure that we have sketched is the natural one that should be followed in synchronizing clocks , since it is simply obtained by using the prescriptions of the einstein convention in each point of space .",
    "the reader should distinguish between this procedure and the one that leads to the mrzke - wheeler coordinates since in the latter case an observer is privileged . in order to avoid confusions , in what follows we shall refer to the einstein synchronization convention as a local procedure to be applied in each point of space . as we shall see this procedure can not be applied in every circumstance @xcite . in gauge theory the curve @xmath37 is called the horizontal lift of @xmath33 ; it is the only curve which starts from @xmath34 , has horizontal tangent vectors , and projects onto @xmath33 .",
    "before we start studying the curvature and its implications , we recall some notions regarding local observers . an observer is identified by a tetrad of orthonormal vectors @xmath38 .",
    "a picture of @xmath39 may be the following : imagine the local laboratory of the observer to be a cube .",
    "the observer , at rest in the cube , stands by one of the corners and the normal vectors @xmath40 point towards the next three corners .",
    "since @xmath40 points always towards the same corner it must satisfy @xmath41 let @xmath42 be the projector on the horizontal space of the observer .",
    "the evolution of the components of @xmath40 with respect to a fermi transported tetrad ( non - rotating reference frame ) @xmath43 is well known @xcite , the relevant quantities are the vorticity tensor @xmath44}\\ , , \\ ] ] which represents the angular velocity of the triad @xmath39 with respect to gyroscopes ( @xmath45 ) , and the expansion tensor @xmath46 which represents the rate of separation of neighboring points from the worldline . from eq .",
    "( [ four ] ) , after some algebra , we find that the expansion tensor vanishes thus allowing a local rigidity interpretation",
    ". the vorticity can be rewritten @xmath47}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{k",
    "\\cdot k}}{2}\\ , \\omega_{\\mu   \\nu},\\ ] ] where we have introduced the curvature @xmath48 the translational invariance of spacetime implies that the vorticity , the curvature and the norm of the killing vector field have a vanishing lie derivative . as a consequence the angular velocity of an observer at rest in the stationary frame points always in the same direction with the same norm .",
    "its components with respect to @xmath40 do not change in time .",
    "gauge theory tells us that if @xmath12 is paracompact and simply connected the curvature vanishes if and only if the horizontal lifts of closed curves in @xmath12 are closed in @xmath1 . in order to make use of the einstein convention",
    "the horizontal lift should be closed , otherwise there would be two simultaneous events placed in the same time - like worldline . in that case , the einstein convention would be of little use .",
    "if the topological requirements are satisfied : the einstein synchronization convention is applicable if and only if , in every point of the stationary frame , observers at rest do not rotate @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the vorticity is different from zero in a point @xmath19 of space , an observer at rest in that point feels inertial forces because its local reference frame rotates with respect to fermi transported gyroscopes .",
    "these observations assure that the rotating platform in special relativity is indeed quite representative of the general interrelationship between the einstein convention , inertial forces , and rotation .",
    "let us study the simple case @xmath49 .",
    "gauge theory tells us that , when the curvature vanishes , there exists a foliation of the principal bundle in three - dimensional hypersurfaces with horizontal tangent spaces .",
    "they are the hypersurfaces of simultaneity accordingly with the einstein convention .",
    "those hypersurfaces are orthogonal to the killing vector field because their tangent spaces are also orthogonal to it .",
    "the existence of hypersurfaces orthogonal to a vector field is the object of frobenius theorem : the necessary and sufficient condition for the vector field @xmath50 to be hypersurface orthogonal is @xmath51}=0 $ ] .",
    "this condition is indeed coherent with @xmath49 because the equations @xmath52 are algebraically the same .    if @xmath53 the einstein convention is no longer applicable .",
    "here gauge theory suggests a standard procedure to extend coordinates @xmath54 on @xmath12 to the whole principal bundle .",
    "first choose a section @xmath55 and then associate to the event @xmath56 the coordinates @xmath57 .",
    "this procedure depends on the section ( gauge ) chosen and , from the physical side , corresponds to taking the events on the hypersurface @xmath58 as simultaneous .",
    "a number of different simultaneity conventions can be adopted , each one in correspondence with a particular section . in geometry",
    "the change of section is exactly what in physics is a gauge transformation .",
    "hence we pass from one convention to another via gauge transformations",
    ". usually in physics one works with the potential , that is with the pullback @xmath59 . in the coordinates @xmath57",
    ", the poincar connection becomes @xmath60 it is invariant under the change of section ( gauge transformation ) @xmath61 it is also convenient to introduce the field strength @xmath62 .",
    "let us come to a frequent question in gauge theories .",
    "if @xmath63 \\rightarrow s $ ] is a closed curve , how much is @xmath64 such that @xmath65 ? in order to answer this question we have to recall that @xmath37 has horizontal tangent vectors .",
    "integrating @xmath66 over @xmath37 we find @xmath67 the physical interpretation of this result is connected with the sagnac effect @xcite .",
    "let us define over @xmath12 a metric through the formula @xcite @xmath68 in the coordinates @xmath69 introduced above . from a geometrical perspective",
    "this formula for the space metric @xmath70 can be rewritten @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , are the horizontal lifts of the space vectors @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the vectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 belong to the horizontal space of the observer which passes through their origin , and that horizontal space is nothing but the local space of an inertial observer .",
    "hence , from a physical point of view the previous formula says that the space metric is induced from the measurements made by local inertial observers .",
    "this statement relies on the fact that , for an inertial observer , the spacetime metric serves also to define the space metric through the formula @xmath76 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 belong to its space .",
    "however it is an assumption that for accelerating or rotating observers , space measurements should coincide with those performed by inertial observers .",
    "this postulate referred also as the `` surrogate frames postulate '' @xcite is waiting an experimental verification .",
    "actually , in our stationary frame , observers at rest in the frame are not necessarily inertial . to claim that equation",
    "( [ space metric ] ) describes accurately the space metric as experimented by observers at rest in the frame , would go beyond our knowledge . a number of alternatives , especially for the rotating platform",
    "have been suggested @xcite . a similar debate raised in the contest of kaluza - klein extensions of gravity where two different interpretations of the five dimensional metric were natural : those of weyl and pauli @xcite .",
    "this is not accidental as the mathematics involved in the spacetime splitting in time plus space is that of kaluza -klein theories .",
    "indeed the spacetime metric can be rewritten @xmath77 which is a kaluza - klein metric in the spacetime manifold .",
    "another useful choice for the space metric is the optical metric @xcite , @xmath78 . indeed",
    "the geodesics of light , and hence their projections , are invariant under conformal transformations of the spacetime metric @xmath79 . in the study of light propagation",
    "we can reduce the spacetime metric to the form , @xmath80 where no conformal factor appears .",
    "now , the projection of a geodesic of a kaluza - klein metric with unitary scalar field , @xmath81 , satisfies a straightforward generalization of the lorentz law . in the null case",
    "it reads @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the tangent vector of the projection and @xmath84 is the covariant derivative with respect to the optical levi - civita connection .",
    "hence , at least light rays , satisfy a lorentz like equation in the optical metric background . here",
    "we use the optical metric as a tool for finding the dynamic phase(see figure [ holonomy ] ) .",
    "let us consider two light beams that leave @xmath85 following the path @xmath32 , one in the positive direction and the other in the negative direction .",
    "figure [ holonomy ] shows one of the beam and displays some relevant quantities like the dynamic phase @xmath86 and the holonomy @xmath64 .",
    "as seen from the local inertial frames along @xmath33 , with respect to their local einstein synchronized times , the two light beams have the same speed @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 be the natural parameter of @xmath33 .",
    "the dynamic phase is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the total optical length of the path @xmath33 .",
    "coming back to the sagnac effect , the dynamic phase does not depend on the direction followed by the light beam . on the contrary , the holonomy changes sign ; as a consequence the difference of the arrival times of the two beams is twice eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) , and taking into account the time dilation , that is the difference between killing time and proper time , the sagnac effect becomes @xmath91 this equation is conveniently written in the coordinates @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be a two - dimensional surface such that @xmath94 .",
    "from @xmath9 we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 , hence @xcite @xmath97 notice that the worldline of a point at rest in the stationary frame has equation , @xmath98 .",
    "this condition , and the independence of @xmath2 of time , selects those systems of coordinates for which the previous equation holds .",
    "we have completed our exposition of the gauge property of simultaneity in stationary frames .",
    "the reader familiar with gauge theories can easily recognize the formal similarity with electrodynamics .",
    "both theories have the mathematical structure of a gauge theory over a one - dimensional group .",
    "the only relevant difference is that in the stationary frame the structure group is contractible ( otherwise there would be closed time - like curves ) , whereas in electrodynamics , @xmath99 , is not .",
    "this implies that , in electrodynamics , we can have non trivial principal bundles like monopoles , whereas this is not possible in the present context .",
    "other analogies , like that between the sagnac effect and the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , or like that between magnetic forces and coriolis forces @xcite , become self evident in light of the gauge interpretation .",
    ".gauge interpretation of simultaneity .",
    "the correspondences in italic hold in stationary frames but do not hold in general . [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "so far we have considered stationary frames . in general , however , the trajectories of the observers which define the frame , are not generated by a killing vector field .",
    "this does not imply that the simultaneity is no more described by a gauge theory , but only that there is no connection preserving structure group .",
    "we can still define the space @xmath12 as the manifold of the observer worldlines .",
    "then , discarding some pathological choices for the trajectories , at least in an open set , the space @xmath12 will be a differentiable manifold and there will be a differentiable projection @xmath100 . hence , again , @xmath1 can be considered as a fiber bundle over the space @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noticed that over this bundle one can define the action of the one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms @xmath101 generated by the four - velocity field @xmath102 . with this right action @xmath1",
    "can be considered , at least locally , as a principal bundle . however , in general , such a structure group does not preserve the simultaneity connection .",
    "it is , then , more convenient to treat @xmath1 as a fiber bundle without structure group since the beginning .",
    "the theory of connections , i.e. gauge theory , was developed by mathematicians in this general context @xcite .",
    "generalized connections appeared also in physics in some works on kaluza - klein theory and general relativity @xcite . in those papers",
    "it was shown that most of the usual gauge theory has an analogue in the new setting even from the dynamical side . however , they did not take advantage of the coordinate - independent approach developed by mathematicians .",
    "let us introduce the generalized connection in a form useful for our purposes . a connection is given by a distribution of planes @xmath103 , that is , by a differentiable assignment , in each point of the bundle , of a plane that we shall call horizontal .",
    "the plane , together with the tangent space of the fiber spans the tangent space at @xmath104 .",
    "the relevant difference with the usual gauge theory is the absence of a structure group which sends the fiber to itself and horizontal planes to horizontal planes .",
    "many of the features of the usual gauge theory have a generalization .",
    "it is still possible to define the horizontal lift , the curvature and the parallel transport .",
    "even the bianchi identities have a generalization @xcite .    in our case",
    ", the fiber bundle m has a natural connection .",
    "the horizontal planes are given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the four - velocity of the observer . in this way",
    "the connection maintains its original meaning : the horizontal plane still selects , locally , those events which are simultaneous accordantly with the einstein synchronization convention .",
    "analogously , the horizontal lift @xmath37 is obtained by a pointwise einstein synchronization over @xmath33 .",
    "notice that the connection @xmath107 is defined only up to a spacetime factor , because its ker does not change after such a multiplication .",
    "for this reason , in the generalized gauge theory , one works with the vector valued connection @xmath108 , which is the projector of the tangent space onto the vertical subspace .",
    "the curvature is defined through the frlicher - nijenhuis bracket which acts on a pair of vector valued forms , say @xmath109 and @xmath110 of degree @xmath3 and @xmath88 respectively , giving a vector valued form of degree @xmath111 . if @xmath112 and @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 vector fields , the frlicher - nijenhuis bracket can be characterized by @xmath116_{fn}= \\alpha \\wedge \\beta \\otimes [ z , v]+\\alpha \\wedge l_{z } \\beta \\otimes v \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\",
