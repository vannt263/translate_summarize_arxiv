    "the iron - based superconductors ( fehtss ) can essentially be classifed into two large families based on their electronic structure . the first family is comprised of iron pnictides and fe(te , se ) bulk crystals , whose fermi surfaces are composed of both electron and hole pockets @xcite . built on the spin fluctuations between the electron and hole fermi pockets ,",
    "a sign - changing @xmath6-wave pairing was predicted by weak coupling theories @xcite .",
    "the second family consists of @xmath7fe@xmath2se@xmath8 ( _ _ a__=k , rb , cs , tl / k ) @xcite , ( li@xmath9fe@xmath10)ohfese @xcite , the amonia - intercalated li@xmath1(nh@xmath8)@xmath11(nh@xmath12)@xmath13fe@xmath8se@xmath8 @xcite , and the recently discovered monolayer fese thin film @xcite .",
    "the fermi surfaces of this family of fehtss consist only of electron pockets .",
    "the nodeless gap observed in these iron - chalcogenides has posed a serious challenge to the weak coupling theories , which have predicted gap nodes for such a fermi surface topology @xcite .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive understanding of microscopic behaviors of both families is critical for understanding the mechanism of fehts .",
    "recently , a systematic angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) investigation was conducted in many series of the first families of fehtss , including bulk fe(te , se ) , bafe@xmath8(as@xmath14p@xmath1)@xmath8 , ba(fe@xmath14ru@xmath1)@xmath8as@xmath8 , nafe@xmath14co@xmath15as and life@xmath14co@xmath15as @xcite . in all these compounds ,",
    "the bandwidths are found to increase with the doping level @xmath16 , as the superconductivity is weakened and eventually suppressed at high doping levels , regardless of the doping traits being heterovalent or isovalent .",
    "such an observation is consistent with strong coupling theories , where pairing is mediated by local antiferromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "it is then intriguing to ask if similar behavior is also present for the second family of fehts .",
    "however , in contrast to the first family of fehts , an in - depth understanding of the doping dependence of the second family of fehts is still lacking for several reasons .",
    "the doping of many members of the second family is discrete or can not be controlled . in particular , for the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenides ( @xmath7fe@xmath2se@xmath8 and the like ) that comprise most of this family , there is an intrinsic phase separation between a @xmath17 @xmath18 fe - vacancy ordered insulating phase ( also called the  245 \" phase ) and a superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "consequently , the doping - dependence of the microscopic properties of this series has not been investigated extensively .",
    "recent progress in materials synthesis has enabled the tuning of the superconductivity of @xmath7fe@xmath2se@xmath8 in a more controlled manner . as shown in fig .",
    "[ transport](a ) , phase diagrams have been obtained when replacing se with te or s in @xmath7fe@xmath2se@xmath8 ( _ a _ = k , rb ) @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , though the chemical pressure is tensile for te doping and compressional for s doping as shown by their lattice constant evolution in fig .",
    "[ transport](b ) , superconductivity is gradually suppressed in both cases . see the supplementary material for in - plane resistivity and magnetic susceptibility data @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that at low temperature the resistivity on the s - overdoped side is metallic , while that on the te - overdoped side is insulating .    in this work",
    ", we systematically studied the low energy electronic structure of @xmath7fe@xmath2(se , s / te)@xmath8 ( _ _ a__=k , rb , tl / k ) , and we show that they can be fit into one generic phase diagram , with bandwidth or correlation strength being the control parameter .",
    "we found that on decreasing bandwidth , the ground state of these compounds evolves from a metal to a superconductor and then to an insulator , which has almost all the essential ingredients of the cuprate phase diagram , except that bandwidth , rather than carrier doping , is the control parameter .",
    "intriguingly , the insulating phase found here has a small band filling and is induced by band narrowing from a superconducting phase , which resembles the bandwidth - controlled mott transition , except that the latter requires an _ integer _ band filling",
    ". therefore it might indicate either a novel correlation - driven insulator , or that the unit cell has been somehow expanded by certain ordering .",
    "our results give a microscopic and unified understanding of various chemical - substitution - based phase diagrams of the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenide fehts .",
    "the revealed relationship between the superconductivity and the electronic correlations is reminiscent of similar observations made in iron pnictides @xcite , and thus might lead to a comprehensive understanding of both families of fehts .",

    "moreover , our high - resolution transmission electron microscope ( hrtem ) data of rb@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath21te@xmath19 show that the @xmath17 @xmath18 vacancy - ordered `` 245 '' insulating phase coexists with a @xmath36 @xmath37 superstructured phase in mesoscopic scale @xcite .",
    "since a similar @xmath36 @xmath37 superstructure exists in the superconducting phase , as shown by the band folding in fig .",

    "this insulator is distinct from that induced by fe vacancies in the `` 245 '' phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , since te only introduces chemical pressure instead of altering the band filling , such a sudden disappearance of fermi surface when the bandwidth diminishes indicate a correlation - driven superconductor / metal - insulator transition . due to the strong competitions among various inter - site exchange interactions and strong spin fluctuations in the iron chalcogenides ,",
    "as exemplified in bulk fese @xcite , it is an open question whether there is a magnetic order in this insulator phase with the @xmath36 @xmath37 superstructure .",
    "this might be answered by future neutron scattering studies .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , band calculations indicate that the bare bandwidths of kfe@xmath3te@xmath3 , kfe@xmath3se@xmath3 and kfe@xmath3s@xmath3 only differ by about 63% ( @xmath40 ) and 19% ( @xmath30 ) @xcite . by applying a linear interpolation",
    ", we estimate that the change of the bare bandwidth in the measured doping range here should be within 32% ( @xmath40 ) and 10% ( @xmath30 ) . the remarkable change of the bandwidths in fig .",
    "[ bandwidth ] is thus due to the additional bandwidth renormalization by electronic correlations , which is driven largely by hund s rule coupling in the fehtss @xcite .",
    "similar behaviors have been observed in the prototypical bandwidth - controlled mott transition of nis@xmath41se@xmath15 @xcite . because the bare bandwidth and the effective bandwidth are monotonically",
    "related , either of them can be used to characterize the itinerancy or kinetic energy . however , since the effective bandwidth not only represents the itinerancy of quasiparticles , but also carries the information on the electronic correlations in these compounds , we use the effective bandwidth in the following discussions .",
    "in addition to the bandwidth , effective mass ( @xmath42 ) and fermi velocity ( @xmath43 ) of the @xmath29 band reflect the electronic correlation strength as well . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bandwidth](f ) , @xmath42 decreases from the te - overdoped side to the s - overdoped side , while @xmath43 shows the opposite trend accordingly .",
    "taking @xmath30 as the electronic parameter , one can obtain the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , which shows that superconductivity is suppressed by driving the bandwidth away from its optimal value by doping either the isovalent s or te .",
    "furthermore , we have examined whether other sibling iron - chalcogenides can fit into this phase diagram .",
    "data for tl@xmath19k@xmath19fe@xmath20se@xmath8 ( @xmath31 = 29 k ) and tl@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4s@xmath5 ( non - superconducting ) are shown in figs .",

    "their electron pockets are slightly larger than those of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 , while their @xmath29 bands are much broader ( fig .",
    "[ tl ] ) . after compensating the small difference in the fermi pockets by rigid shifting their fermi crossings to match those of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3",
    ", one can obtain their @xmath30s .",
    "they are still much larger than 150 mev , far above the superconducting regime in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "we note that a similar phase diagram can be reached if using @xmath42 as the horizontal axis .",
    "we have observed the bandwidth evolution of the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenides by substituting se with s or te , and obtain a unified phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] from metal ( s side ) to superconductor , then to an insulator ( te side ) , with nearly fixed fermi surface and negligible impurity scattering effects ( see supplementary materials @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is no noticeable orbital occupation change either . the dramatic change of bandwidth ( or band bottom of @xmath29 ) signifies strong correlation effects in iron - selenides .",
    "such a bandwidth - controlled or correlation - driven superconductor - to - insulator transition resembles the bandwidth - controlled or the brinkman - rice mott transition , where the bandwidth decreases to zero or the quasiparticle mass diverges @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a mott transition , no matter in a single - band or multiple - band system , requires integer filling of the band @xcite , whereas there is a small band filling in the insulating state of te - overdoped sample .",
    "therefore , it is not a mott insulator or at least not a usual one , instead , it could be a novel correlation - driven insulator where anderson localization might play a role .",
    "alternatively , judging from the depleted spectral weight at the chemical potential , it is also likely that certain order , such as charge density wave , might have occured and multiplied the unit cell , which in turn would cause an integer band filling , and give a mott transition .",
    "recently , j. he and coauthors reported a carrier - doping - induced insulating phase in monolayer fese @xcite .",
    "however , it was later found by y. fang and coauthors that similar band structure and insulating phase could be reproduced in fese films with iron vacancies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the insulating phase in fese film is qualitatively different from the insulating rb@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4te@xmath5 ( _ _ z__=0.3 , 0.4 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , there is a metallic regime between the insulating phase and superconducting phase .",
    "if this regime existed in real materials , it would correspond to the narrow tellurium concentration range of 0.28 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath44 0.3 . since this doping range is quite narrow",
    ", the sudden change between insulating state and superconducting state indicates that the superconductor - to - insulator transition here is likely of first order , and this metallic regime may not exist in real materials .",
    "consistently in this narrow doping range , the transport behaviors evolve drastically , and there is some trace of the superconducting phase , an indicative of phase separation @xcite .    towards the large bandwidth or weak correlation regime ,",
    "the behavior of the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenides resembles the observations made before in the first family of fehts @xcite .",
    "that is , the superconductivity is weakened and eventually suppressed at the high doping level with increased bandwidth . however , in the strong correlation regime , most iron pnictides enters the competing collinear antiferromagnetic metallic ground state instead of an insulating state found here .",
    "nevertheless , all these results jointly suggest that the bandwidth or correlation strength provides a unifying standpoint in understanding the ground - state evolutions in both families of fehts s .    like the @xmath46-@xmath47 model for the cuprate",
    ", fehtss have been described by effective models with short - range antiferromagnetic exchange couplings in strong local pairing scenarios , which could give the pairing symmetries and gap functions for both families of fehtss @xcite . in such effective models ,",
    "there are two critical parameters that control the superconductivity : the renormalized effective bandwidth , @xmath48 , and the effective antiferromagnetic coupling strength @xmath47 ( or multiple @xmath49s among various neighbors ) .",
    "the superconductivity appears when the ratio of @xmath50 is bound within a certain region . below the lower",
    "bound , electron correlations are too weak , so that the system can not sustain the unconventional high temperature superconductivity ; while beyond the upper bound , too strong electron correlations or too weak itinerancy would give an insulator and/or magnetic ordered phase instead of a superconductor . if the effective short - range antiferromagnetic exchange couplings @xmath47s do not vary significantly with the isovalent doping , as in the case of fehtss @xcite , the bandwidth ( or other equivalent parameters describing electron itinerancy , or conversely , correlation ) becomes the pivotal variable that controls the evolution of superconductivity , as observed here in these 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenide superconductors .",
    "therefore , the observed robust correlation between the superconductivity and @xmath48 provides a compelling support for the local pairing scenario in the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenides superconductors .",
    "furthermore , in the strong coupling theories that tried to understand both fehtss and cuprates @xcite , the phase evolution is controlled by the competition between the kinetic energy and interactions . therefore , it is not surprising that the phase diagram found here resembles the cuprate phase diagram , except that the control parameter here is bandwidth , instead of carrier doping .",
    "note that in the cuprate case , with increased doping , the effective bandwidth increases , and the correlation strength decreases . as a result ,",
    "it is possible to understand both the fehtss and the cuprates in such a unified way .",
    "finally , we note that our data further challenges the weak coupling mechanism , which stresses the interactions of electrons around the fermi surface . in this kind of scenarios ,",
    "the stronger correlations ( or narrower bandwidth , smaller @xmath43 ) give rise to a larger dos , which is expected to yield higher @xmath31 , when the fermi surface is invariant upon isovalent doping .",
    "however , our data suggests that the superconductivity will be strongly suppressed once the electron correlation strength goes beyond the optimal regime , even though the dos continuously increases .",
    "for example , rb@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4te@xmath5 has stronger correlations but a lower @xmath31 than rb@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , tl@xmath19k@xmath19fe@xmath20se@xmath8 and k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 have almost the same @xmath31 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ bandwidth](f ) ] , while there is significant difference between their sizes of fermi surfaces .",
    "this is not consistent with the weak coupling mechanism as well .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that the superconductivity evolutions in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4s@xmath5 , rb@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4te@xmath5 and ( tl , k)@xmath15fe@xmath2se@xmath4s@xmath51 can be comprehensively understood from their bandwidth evolutions .",
    "we have found a correlation driven phase evolution from metal to superconductor , and eventually to a non - trivial insulating phase .",
    "our data suggest that correlation ( or bandwidth as the electronic control parameter ) plays a critical role in the iron based superconductors with only electron fermi surfaces , as found before for those with both electron and hole fermi surfaces .",
    "our results thus present an important step to the unified understanding of all the iron - based superconductors , which are consistent with the strong local pairing scenarios .",

    "<S> the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenide superconductors , for example k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 , only possesses electron fermi pockets . </S>",
    "<S> their distinctive electronic structure challenges the picture built upon iron pnictide superconductors , where both electron and hole fermi pockets coexist . </S>",
    "<S> however , partly due to the intrinsic phase separation in this family of compounds , many aspects of their behavior remain elusive . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of the 122@xmath0 series of iron - chalcogenides with chemical substitution still lacks a microscopic and unified interpretation . using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , we studied a major fraction of 122@xmath0 iron - chalcogenides , including the isovalently ` doped ' k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4s@xmath5 , rb@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4te@xmath5 and ( tl , k)@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath4s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the bandwidths of the low energy fe _ </S>",
    "<S> 3d _ bands in these materials depend on doping ; and more crucially , as the bandwidth decreases , the ground state evolves from a metal to a superconductor , and eventually to an insulator , yet the fermi surface in the metallic phases is unaffected by the isovalent dopants . moreover , the correlation - driven insulator found here with small band filling may be a novel insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that almost all the known 122@xmath0-series iron chalcogenides can be understood _ via _ one unifying phase diagram which implies that moderate correlation strength is beneficial for the superconductivity . </S>"
