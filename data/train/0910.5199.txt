    "we are concerned with the following problem : given an equilateral triangle @xmath2 , find all dissections of @xmath2 into smaller nonoverlapping equilateral triangles .",
    "the _ size _ of a dissection is the number of nonoverlapping equilateral triangles .",
    "an example of such a dissection of size @xmath3 is shown in figure  [ exdissection ] .",
    "it is well known that in such a dissection all triangles may be regarded as triangles with sides of integer length .",
    "dissections of squares have been studied earlier  @xcite as well as dissections of squares into right - angled isosceles triangles  @xcite .",
    "recently , laczkovich@xcite studied tilings of polygons by similar triangles .",
    "the earliest study of dissections of equilateral triangles into equilateral triangles is by tutte  @xcite .",
    "the problem of dissecting a triangle is different to normal tiling problems where the size of the tiles is known in advance and the tiling area may be infinite .",
    "a naive approach to enumerating dissections is to first fix the sizes and number of the dissecting triangles . observe that in any dissection , some triangles will be oriented in the same way as the triangle @xmath2 ( these are the up - triangles ) while the oppositely oriented triangles are the down - triangles .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the number of up and down triangles of side length @xmath6 , respectively . for any down - triangle the horizontal side is adjacent to the horizontal side of some number of up - triangles .",
    "the up - triangles along the bottom of @xmath2 are not adjacent to any down - triangle .",
    "so if the triangle @xmath2 has side length @xmath7 then @xmath8 a triangle with length @xmath9 has height @xmath10 and so the triangle areas give the relation @xmath11 for small values of @xmath12 we can solve and for the permissible size and number of up and down triangles , and this data may guide an exhaustive search",
    ". we will consider up and down triangles not to be congruent even if they are of the same size .",
    "a _ perfect tiling _ or _ perfect dissection _ has no pair of congruent triangles .",
    "this definition of a perfect dissection arises from the fact that it is impossible to have a perfect dissection if orientation is ignored  @xcite .",
    "this fact can also easily derived from the results in  @xcite .",
    "tutte conjectured  @xcite that the smallest perfect dissection has size @xmath1 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately solving and with @xmath13 is computationally intensive and so another approach is needed . using our enumerative methods we confirm tutte s conjecture and provide all perfect dissections up to size @xmath0 .",
    "lines parallel to the outer sides of the main triangle that are induced by a side of a dissecting triangle are _ dissecting lines_. for any dissecting line @xmath14 , the union of all sides of dissecting triangles that are incident to @xmath14 forms one or more contiguous segments . if there are two or more segments , then on @xmath14 there exist two dissecting vertices such that all triangles in between are cut by the line into two parts .",
    "if such a situation arises for no dissecting line and if no dissecting vertex is incident to six dissecting triangles , then we call the dissection",
    "_ separated_. we enumerate all isomorphism classes of separated and nonseparated dissections up to size @xmath0 .",
    "the connection between equilateral triangle dissections and latin bitrades was first studied in  @xcite .",
    "the presentation here follows  @xcite .",
    "consider an equilateral triangle @xmath2 that is dissected into a finite number of equilateral triangles .",
    "dissections will be always assumed to be nontrivial so the number of dissecting triangles is at least four .",
    "denote by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the lines induced by the sides of @xmath2 .",
    "each side of a dissecting triangle has to be parallel to one of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 is a vertex of a dissecting triangle , then @xmath18 is a vertex of exactly one , three or six dissecting triangles .",
    "suppose that there is no vertex with six triangles and consider triples @xmath19 of lines that are parallel to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and meet in a vertex of a dissecting triangle that is not a vertex of @xmath2 .",
    "the set of all these triples together with the triple @xmath20 will be denoted by @xmath21 , and by @xmath22 we shall denote the set of all triples @xmath19 of lines that are yielded by sides of a dissecting triangle ( where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are again parallel to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ) .",
    "the following conditions hold :    1 .   sets @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 are disjoint ; 2 .   for all @xmath26 and all @xmath27 , @xmath28 ,",
    "there exists exactly one @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; and 3 .   for all @xmath32 and all @xmath27 , @xmath28 ,",
    "there exists exactly one @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "note that ( r2 ) would not be true if there had existed six dissecting triangles with a common vertex .",
    "conditions ( r13 ) are , in fact , axioms of a combinatorial object called latin bitrades @xcite . a bitrade is usually denoted @xmath36 .",
    "observe that the bitrade @xmath37 associated with a dissection encodes qualitative ( structural ) information about the segments and intersections of segments in the dissection .",
    "the sizes and number of dissecting triangles can be recovered by solving a system of equations derived from the bitrade ( see below ) .",
    "dissections are related to a class of latin bitrades with genus  @xmath38 .",
    "to calculate the genus of a bitrade we use a permutation representation to construct an oriented combinatorial surface  @xcite . for @xmath39 , define the map @xmath40 where @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 . by ( r1 - 3 ) each @xmath45 is a bijection",
    ". then @xmath46 are defined by @xmath47 we refer to @xmath48 $ ] as the @xmath49 _ representation_. to get a combinatorial surface from a bitrade we use the following construction :    [ constructiontauisurface ] let @xmath48 $ ] be the representation for a bitrade where the @xmath49 act on the set @xmath50 .",
    "define vertex , directed edge , and face sets by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes a face with @xmath53  directed edges @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 for vertices @xmath59 .",

    "@xmath49 faces_. assign triangular faces a positive ( anticlockwise ) orientation , and assign @xmath49 faces negative ( clockwise ) orientation .",
    "now glue the faces together where they share a common directed edge @xmath61 , ensuring that edges come together with opposite orientation",
    ".    the orientation of a triangular face is shown in figure  [ figtwoorientations ] along with the orientation for a @xmath49 face .",
    "for the sake of concreteness we have illustrated a @xmath62-cycle face due to a @xmath62-cycle of @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ figdrapalrotationscheme ] shows the rotation scheme for an arbitrary vertex in the surface .         is a cycle of @xmath49 .",

    "then euler s formula @xmath71 gives @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the genus of the combinatorial surface .",

    "@xmath103 we form the triangle @xmath104 which is bounded by the lines @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "of course , it is not clear that @xmath108 is really a triangle , i.  e.  that the three lines do not meet in a single point .",

    "a separated dissection with @xmath110 vertices corresponds to a separated spherical bitrade @xmath36 where @xmath111 .",
    "one of the main results of  @xcite is the following theorem :    [ sepdissections ] let @xmath112 be a spherical latin bitrade , and suppose that @xmath113 is a triple such that the solution to @xmath114 is separated .",

    ", @xmath99 , @xmath100 , refer to lines @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the trade @xmath138 has @xmath139 entries and the dissection has @xmath140 vertices . applying the transformation @xmath120",
    "gives an equilateral dissection . ]",

    "pick a vertex @xmath18 of degree  @xmath141 .",
    "if we move to the right along the row segment to the next vertex @xmath142 then we have @xmath143 .",
    "similarly , moving along the diagonal segments gives the action of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "if we identify the three vertices of degree @xmath144 then the dissection encodes , geometrically , the permutation representation of the bitrade .",
    "if a dissection has a vertex of degree  @xmath62 then the dissecting triangles do not ( uniquely ) define a partial latin square and hence do not encode a latin bitrade .",
    "however , we can recover a separated bitrade by the following procedure .",
    "for each vertex @xmath18 of degree  @xmath62 , choose one segment ( say , the @xmath98 segment ) to stay fixed . then for the @xmath99 and @xmath100 segments , label the column segment below @xmath18 with a new name @xmath145 and label the symbol segment below @xmath18 with a new name @xmath146 .",
    "for example , the centre vertex in figure  [ figsixway ] results in the new labels @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the resulting separated bitrade is : @xmath149 this procedure works for any number of vertices of degree  @xmath62 , as long as care is taken to only relabel column or symbol segments below a vertex of degree  @xmath62 and not to relabel a segment more than once .    .",
    "]    recently theorem  [ sepdissections ] has been strengthened to cover nonseparated as well as separated dissections :    [ strongertheorem ] let @xmath112 be a spherical latin bitrade . then for any @xmath113 , the set @xmath109 of non - degenerate triangles dissects the triangle @xmath116 @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the dissection may not be separated .",
    "a fundamental consequence of the theorem is that any dissection of size @xmath6 can be derived from a pointed spherical bitrade @xmath150 of size @xmath6 .",
    "note that the systems of equations @xmath93 have also other applications : both @xcite and @xcite use them to show that every spherical latin trade can be embedded into a finite abelian group .",
    "cavenagh and lisonk  @xcite showed that spherical bitrades are equivalent to planar eulerian triangulations . to enumerate triangle dissections we use plantri  @xcite to enumerate all planar eulerian triangulations up to size  @xmath0",

    "we wrote a plugin  @xcite to output the equivalent spherical latin bitrade @xmath152 for each triangulation .",
    "for each such @xmath153 we find all solutions @xmath93 for all @xmath154 and compute each dissection ( in practise this is a list of triangles @xmath104 for each @xmath155 ) . to filter out isomorphic dissections",

    "we repeat the whole process for the bitrade @xmath157 because there are spherical latin bitrades where @xmath153 is not isomorphic to @xmath157 .",
    "the final counts for the number of dissections up to isomorphism are found by simply removing duplicate signatures .    while the solutions to @xmath93 exist in the rationals , we find it easier to work with the final equilateral dissections instead .",
    "we use the sympy package  @xcite to perform exact symbolic arithmetic on the canonical form of each dissection .      using theorems  [ sepdissections ] and [ strongertheorem ] we have enumerated the number of isomorphism classes of dissections of size @xmath158 .",
