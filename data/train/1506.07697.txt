    "the theoretical understanding of the notion of equilibration in closed quantum systems has significantly developed in recent years.@xcite in the absence of a thermal bath and the presence of quantum fluctuations , the classical concepts of the physical and mathematical description of equilibration do in general not work anymore.@xcite therefore , it is of utmost importance to first properly define what we mean by equilibration in closed quantum systems that can even be in a highly non - thermal state .",
    "this difficult task is one of the driving forces of the research area of quantum thermodynamics .",
    "useful concepts imply different definitions of equilibration .",
    "for instance , many authors identify equilibrium with the saturation of the expectation values of certain observables.@xcite these ideas are appealing as they are intuitive and the relevant quantities are measureable . however , as it is argued in ref .  , this definition is not satisfying because the measurable probabilities of the outcomes of an observable may still be dynamical while its expectation values has saturated . in our article , we start from a more sophisticated concept@xcite and link it to the above discussed ideas of saturating expectation values .",
    "doing so , we connect abstract definitions of quantum equilibration to a very concrete experimental system where one could potentially see this exciting physics .",
    "the system we have in mind is an electron spin confined in quantum dot ( qd ) that functions as a spin qubit.@xcite in typical host materials , like gaas,@xcite silicon@xcite or carbon,@xcite the electron spin is coupled to many nuclear spins by the hyperfine interaction.@xcite the number of nuclear spins that matters for the electron spin depends on the size of the qd , i.e. the confinement , and the natural abundance of nuclear - spin carrying isotopes of the host material . in practice , this number can range between very few nuclear spins ( in silicon- or carbon - based systems)@xcite to millions ( in gaas - based qds).@xcite in recent years , the experimental control of spin qubits in qds has developed to a state of perfection at the single- and two - qubit level.@xcite it is possible to initialize , manipulate,@xcite and read - out@xcite spin qubits with a very high precision and to even engineer the state of the nuclear spin bath@xcite to increase coherence times .",
    "these remarkable experimental achievements have been accompanied by sophisticated theoretical research,@xcite which has promoted the understanding of spin dynamics in qds with regard to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "therefore , we believe that these systems are ideally suited to study predictions related to quantum equilibration .    first , we have to introduce a general theory of equilibration of the closed quantum system that fulfills all the requirements of the realization that we have in mind .",
    "this will be done on the basis of the _",
    "distinguishability_@xcite which is a measure to distinguish the actual state of a quantum system from its equilibrium state on the basis of a finite set of observables .",
    "if the values of the distinguishability are on average smaller than a given reference value @xmath0 we argue that the quantum system is @xmath0-equilibrated . in order to connect our concept of equilibration with experimentally measurable predictions ,",
    "we first relate the distinguishability with the _ weak distinguishability_,@xcite which offers an equivalent description of equilibration under special conditions ( for two - outcome observables ) .",
    "the time - averaged weak distinguishability ( tawd ) , however , is capable to bound variances of expectation values from above .",
    "we have analytically derived certain bounds for the tawd , which depend on the hamiltonian and the initial state of the quantum system . as a consequence , our analytical equilibration bounds for",
    "the tawdshould directly affect the experimentally determined variance of the measurement operator .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to modify the system at hand such that the bounds are varied and to see the difference in a direct measurement of the variance .",
    "evidently , this is a concrete prediction of an observable consequence of quantum equilibration .    with this prediction at hand",
    ", we eventually try to better understand quantum equilibration by looking at our central spin model mentioned above . in order to calculate the tawdhere",
    ", we treat very simple observables like the electron spin operator in direction parallel or perpendicular to an external magnetic field .",
    "since we employ exact diagonalization@xcite for this calculation , we are limited to a finite number of nuclear spins ( up to 10 ) .",
    "however , in state of the art qds based on silicon or carbon host materials , such numbers of nuclear spins are within experimental reach.@xcite hence , the finite size effects we analyze in this article should eventually be experimentally relevant .",
    "we find that our analytical results of bounds of the quantum equilibration describe very well the numerical simulations based on the central spin model for compatible conditions .",
    "this makes us confident that our predictions can be really seen in measurements of the spin dynamics of a confined electron spin coupled to a bath of nuclear spins .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the notion of equilibration employed in this work and introduce the ( weak ) distinguishability used to describe it .",
    "subsequently , in sec .",
    "iii , we will derive analytical results of equilibration bounds . in sec .",
    "iv , these general results are then compared to a central spin model of an electron spin in a qd coupled to a quantum bath of nuclear spins .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with a summary of our main results .",
    "some derivations are presented in three appendices .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe known concepts of quantum equilibration for future reference . we consider a closed quantum system whose state @xmath1 evolves according to the von neumann equation @xmath2 $ ] where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 dimensional hamiltonian of the total system @xmath5 . due to the unitary time evolution",
    ", each finite quantum system obeys a recurrence time @xmath6 , at which the state of the system approaches within some accuracy its initial state .",
    "however , this time does not play a role in most experiments as it scales exponentially@xcite with the dimension of @xmath5 and is almost always much larger than the age of the universe . with",
    "the commonly used and well - defined time - averaged state@xcite @xmath7 one circumvents recurrence problems . throughout this article , @xmath8 is used to denote time averages .",
    "this time - averaged state can be considered as an equilibrium state for several reasons .",
    "first , it does not evolve in time as @xmath9 = 0 $ ] .",
    "more importantly , if the expectation value @xmath10}$ ] of any observable @xmath11 saturates at some value for long times , it can be calculated by @xmath12}={\\,\\mathrm{tr}[{{\\hat{\\omega}}}{{\\hat{o}}}]}$ ] .",
    "in contrast to thermal states like the gibbs state , @xmath13 generally depends on the initial state @xmath14 .",
    "analogously to earlier works@xcite , we regard a quantum mechanical system to be in equilibrium if one can not distinguish between the state @xmath1 of the full system and its equilibrium state @xmath13 for most times by applying a finite set of measurements @xmath15 that can be performed in an experiment .",
    "these measurements are not restricted to subspaces of the whole hilbert space .",
    "hence , this definition does not rely on the subdivision of the full quantum system into a small , measurable system and a large , not measurable bath .",
    "for the above notion of equilibration , it is not sufficient that the expectation value of an observable @xmath16 saturates , since @xmath17 and @xmath18 can still be distinguished by the ( experimentally ) measurable probabilities @xmath19}$ ] of its eigenvalue @xmath20 .",
    "rather each of these time - depend probabilities has to saturate in order to guarantee indistinguishability . considering this necessity , short@xcite has introduced the distinguishability @xmath21}-{\\,\\mathrm{tr}[{{\\hat{p}}}_{j}{{\\hat{\\omega}}}]}\\vert \\,.\\ ] ] as a proper measure of distance between @xmath1 and @xmath13",
    "mathematically , it is closely related to the trace distance , but considers the finite number of accessible measurement operators .",
    "in contrast to the trace distance , however , this measure is not a metric , but a semi - metric since @xmath22 is possible for @xmath23 .",
    "this behavior is important , because it permits the desired property of equilibrated states : a sufficient condition for equilibrium is that one is not capable to distinguish the state of the system @xmath1 from @xmath13 for most times by the set @xmath24 of measurements .    in order to account for the fact that the state of the system must be indistinguishable for most times during the time evolution , one can demand the time - average of the positive quantity @xmath25 to be small.@xcite consequently , we regard a system to be @xmath0-equilibrated at time @xmath26 if @xmath27 where @xmath0 is a small positive constant , which we are free to choose .",
    "a reasonable choice for this constant is , for instance , the precision of the measurement devices in an experiment .",
    "further , we call systems equilibrating in a time interval @xmath28 if the time - averaged distinguishability @xmath29 decreases on average within  @xmath28 .    by introducing the distinguishability and its time average in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist_eps ] ) , we achieved a suitable mathematical definition of our concept of equilibration .",
    "however , the distinguishability can not be measured directly in an experiment . yet , with a slight modification of the distinguishability , one can find the so - called weak distinguishability@xcite @xmath30 } - { \\,\\mathrm{tr}[{{\\hat{\\omega}}}{{\\hat{o}}}]}\\right)^2 .\\ ] ] this quantity is unlike the distinguishability @xmath25 only given by the expectation values of @xmath11 and @xmath13 can not be distinguished by any @xmath31 , we will study the contribution a single but arbitrary observable @xmath11 ] with respect to both @xmath14 and @xmath13 , but does not depend on the probabilities to measure individual eigenvalues .",
    "hence , the weak distinguishability carries the same unit as the squared measurement operator and takes values between 0 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the spectral norm is the eigenvalue of @xmath35 with the largest absolute value .",

    "since experimentally relevant temperatures are on the order of mk to k@xcite , the thermal energy exceeds all other energy scales of the nuclear spins by far . on top of that , to follow the time evolution of the electron spin , many repetitions of the experiment are needed .",
    "since each of these runs start with a different initial state , the nuclear spin state can be described by a totally mixed state @xmath106 on average .",

    "besides this , the only effect of large magnetic fields is a reduced initial value of the tawdfor @xmath125 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "as the electron spin is initially fully polarized parallel to a strong magnetic field , its initial state is almost fully preserved , since the flip - flop terms of the hi are suppressed due to the large zeeman splitting of the electron spin states . in other words , the electron is initially approximately in an eigenstate of the total hamiltonian for strong external magnetic fields .",
    "hence , @xmath14 is already initially close to @xmath13 and , as a consequence , indistinguishable from @xmath13 by means of @xmath131 .",
    "similar effects can be found for polarized states , which we approximate by a gaussian distribution of states characterized by a mean polarization @xmath132 and a standard deviation @xmath133 .",
    "first , we have fixed @xmath134 and varied the mean polarization between @xmath135 and @xmath136 for a system containing @xmath110 nuclear spins .",
    "since the initial states approach eigenstates of the total hamiltonian for increasing polarization , we observe a decreasing initial distinguishability @xmath137 . due to the hi , the tawd@xmath138 saturates again around a value , which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than its initial size . for larger polarizations",
    "this reduction becomes smaller , since the hi spin flip - flops become less effective .",
    "these findings are consistent with a smaller effective dimension @xmath139 of polarized initial states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thirdbound ] ) .",
    "analogous simulations with standard deviations in an interval @xmath140 show no significant differences to these observations .",
    "we finally want to address the question how many nuclear spins are required in order to treat them as a bath . by adding more and more nuclear spins , no sudden change is observed but the fluctuation of spin components of the electron decrease exponentially with the number of nuclear spins , cf .",
    "[ fig : k_dependence ] .    the numerically obtained values of the long - time tawdare about one order of magnitude smaller than the presented bound @xmath141 . considering the estimates made and the generality of the bound",
    ", this is still a fairly good result .",
    "[ fig : k_dependence ] also suggest that quantum fluctuations may decrease even faster with increasing system size than our analytic bounds require .",
    "note that this @xmath89-dependence of the equilibration properties is not limited to mixed states only .",
    "reconsidering previously obtained data@xcite , we have calculated the effective dimension for randomly chosen pure initial states of the nuclear spins . for these states , it scales approximately with @xmath142 . according to @xmath143 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thirdbound ] ) , this dependence also gives rise to an exponential decay of @xmath138 , which is confirmed by our numerics.@xcite as discussed by reimann@xcite , the effective dimension of almost all states grow exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "hence , such a decay is a rather generic result , which can be understood as follows . if we add a nuclear spin to the system , we double both the size of the hilbert space and the number of energies driving the dynamics of the electron spin , which finally leads to the observed reduction of fluctuations .",
    "we can indeed generalize these findings to other quantum systems that differ from our model , e.g. a central spin model with isotropic hyperfine interaction or even topologically different models like spin chains .",

    "the number @xmath145 of bath spins that are sufficient to saturate an electron spin in some arbitrary quantum model increases only logarithmic with the inverse resolution @xmath146 of the measurement : @xmath147 where @xmath148 . for a resolution @xmath149 and an initial state far away from an energy eigenstate ( @xmath150 ) ,",
    "the electron spin components equilibrate in any quantum model with non - degenerate gaps ( @xmath151 ) if the electron is coupled to more than 11 bath spins .",

    "the fit ( dashed line ) suggests a @xmath157 dependence .",
    "we average over at least 100 ( 40 for @xmath158 ) sets of random coupling constants @xmath159 and show the mean value with the standard deviation as blue points .",
    "besides a magnetic field of @xmath160 we use the totally mixed state for nuclear spins but polarize the electron spin in @xmath126 direction . ]",
    "in summary , we have shown how a general theory on equilibration can be applied to a realistic closed quantum system .",
    "we have introduced a specific understanding of equilibration relevant for our system under consideration and analyzed its properties by analytical calculations .",
    "afterwards , we have applied this concept to a model of electron and nuclear spins in a solid state qd , which we have investigated by numerical simulations .",
    "a system is assumed to be in equilibrium , if an observer can not distinguish , for most times , between the actual state of the system and its equilibrium state using a finite set of measurements .",
    "notably , two observers with different measurement sets could come to different conclusions .",
    "this equilibrium state is not necessarily a thermal state since it can , for instance , depend on the initial state of the system .",
    "the distinguishability between the state of the system and its equilibrium state can be quantified by a suitable `` measure of distance '' . in this article",
    ", we consider the so - called weak distinguishability which vanishes whenever the system is in equilibrium . for two - outcome measurements ,",
    "we have been able to show that a saturation of the corresponding expectation values is equivalent to equilibration .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated how the variance of a time - dependent observable can be bounded by this weak distinguishability , which has allowed us to connect this abstract mathematical function to an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "we have also derived three different bounds for the time - averaged weak distinguishability and thereby recovered one previously known bound by means of a new method.@xcite we have therefore been able to predict upper limits to the size of fluctuations in small closed quantum systems .",
    "applying our analytical results to a qd setup in which an electron spin is coupled to nuclear spins of the host material through the hyperfine interaction enables us to make precise predictions .",
    "since this spin system is typically well isolated from its environment , qds can be considered as a closed quantum system for sufficiently short time scales .",
    "we have simulated the time evolution of the total spin system and have analyzed its dependence on experimentally accessible parameters such as the strength of an external magnetic field and the polarization of the initial state of the nuclear spins .",
    "intriguingly , we have discovered cases in which strong magnetic fields do not prevent the electron spin from equilibration , while a polarized bath always diminishes the equilibration capability .",
    "finally , we have also investigated the importance of the number of nuclear spins on equilibration properties .",
    "we show both analytically and numerically that very small amounts of bath spins are sufficient to fully equilibrate the electron spin in our model .",
    "the analytical results even hold for a wider class of spin models , and , thus are not limited to our specific model .",
    "we would like to thank l.  p.  garca - pintos for many stimulating discussions and for sharing with us the unpublished manuscript of ref .  .",

    "this follows from both the semi - positive values of @xmath194 and the @xmath181 in the definition of @xmath52 .",

    "therefore , @xmath203 belongs to the @xmath200-th gap of size @xmath204 .",
