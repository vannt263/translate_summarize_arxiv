    "a @xmath1 linear collider ( lc ) in the 500  gev to 1  tev range would provide exciting physics opportunities  @xcite , complementary to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) currently under construction .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 annihilation mode , such a collider would allow to study physics in @xmath4 and @xmath0 collisions as well .",
    "the photon beams can either be produced by compton backscattering in a dedicated photon collider  @xcite , but they are available , albeit with a softer spectrum , from beamstrahlung  @xcite and bremsstrahlung in any case . therefore numerically",
    "precise and theoretically reliable calculations of @xmath0 cross sections are required for unleashing the physics potential of such a machine .",
    "standard model predictions for on - shell gauge boson production in @xmath0 collisions have been available for a long time in lowest order   and including electroweak radiative corrections  . however , the observed final state in these processes is not the gauge boson pair , but the four fermions that the gauge bosons decay into .",
    "the resonant diagrams that factorize into gauge boson production and decay do _ not _ form a gauge invariant subset . therefore a more detailed investigation , including non - resonant `` background '' diagrams , is needed for obtaining theoretically consistent results .",
    "complete calculations for @xmath5 have been performed in recent years ( see   and references therein ) , but a similar analysis of @xmath6 is not available yet .    for some gauge invariant subsets of the diagrams contributing to @xmath6 , first numerical results in the region above the @xmath2  threshold have been published recently  @xcite .",
    "these studies have focused on numerical calculations of cross sections for specific final states and have not attempted a complete investigation of @xmath6 .",
    "there have also been earlier analytical calculations of the high energy asymptotics of @xmath7 in qed  @xcite . in order to pave the road for a more systematic treatment",
    ", we will give a classification of all gauge invariant subsets for @xmath6 in section  [ sec : diagrams ] .",
    "recently , the search for the intermediate mass higgs in the reaction  @xmath8 below threshold , i.e.  with one off - shell  @xmath9 has been discussed in  @xcite",
    ". this scenario will provide us with an application of our classification .",
    "it is obvious that in this range ( @xmath10 ) , the on - shell diagrams in figure  [ fig : on - shell ] can serve as a rough estimate only and that a more complete analysis is required . in section",
    "[ sec : cross - sections ] we will present numerical results for this process and we will discuss their phenomenological implications",
    ".    we will conclude with an outlook on the construction of a complete monte carlo event generator for @xmath6 , which is in progress .",

    "we start with a classification of all feynman diagrams contributing to four fermion production in @xmath0  collisions .",
    "this classification has to be done from two perspectives : on one hand we have to investigate the different topologies and singularity structures for disentangling signals from backgrounds and for constructing an efficient monte carlo event generator . on the other hand",
    ", we have to classify the flavor structure of the final states and the gauge invariant subsets of diagrams corresponding to them . in this classification",
    "we will use the analogue of the established notation proposed for  @xmath11 in  @xcite .    we will perform the classification for massless fermions and in unitarity gauge first . later",
    "we will discuss the modifications for massive fermions and for @xmath12  gauge .",
    "the feynman diagrams for @xmath13 have six different topologies , which are depicted in figure  [ fig : q / d / t / s / b / m ] .",
    "all diagrams can be derived from these six topologies by charge conjugation and permutation of final state fermions .",
    "each of these topologies corresponds to a particular singularity structure and will be dominant in different regions of phase space : @xmath14 and @xmath15 have two resonant gauge boson propagators , while @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 have a single resonant gauge boson .",
    "the multi - peripheral contribution @xmath19 has no resonant gauge bosons at all .",
    "an efficient multi channel event generator will use these six topologies as subchannels for mapping kinematical singularities .",
    "+   +      while the unravelling of the singularity structures presented in the previous section is essential for the construction of a monte carlo event generator , the classification of the gauge invariant subsets is more conveniently performed from a different point of view .",
    "since the photon couplings are diagonal in flavor space , the flavor structure of the four fermion final states can be investigated easily by looking at the amplitude for  @xmath20 ( see figure  [ fig:0to4f ] ) .",
    "the gauge invariant subsets of diagrams are then obtained by hooking two photons to the charged propagators in all possible ways .",
    "+    ( 30,15 )    for two generations and a diagonal ckm matrix , there are alltogether 45  different four fermion final states in @xmath0  collisions .",
    "twelve of these are six pairs of charge conjugate states .",
    "the third generation will add 53  final states , which are trivial replicas of final states appearing in the two generation case .",
    "therefore we will restrict our discussion to the case of two generations .",
    ".[tab : cc ] the 12  _",
    "cc@xmath21 _ final states .",
    "including a third generation increases the count to  30 . in this and",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the modifications for massive fermions in unitarity gauge are trivial : iff all four fermions are massive , the sets _ nc20 _ and  _ nc40 _ are augmented by higgs exchange diagrams to _ nc30 _ and  _",
    "nc60_. all final states corresponding to the set _ nc06 _ contain neutrinos ( see table  [ tab : nc ] ) and remain unaffected .",
    "the charged current final states remain unaffected by the higgs at tree level as well",
    ".      in a @xmath12  gauge , additional diagrams involving the charged and neutral goldstone bosons  @xmath22 have to be taken into account .",
    "since the couplings of the goldstone bosons are proportional to the masses of the participating particles , only the diagram  @xmath23 depicted in figure  [ fig : d ] has to be added for massless fermions in the final state .",
    "+ ( @xmath23 )    ( 30,20 )    for massive fermions , the situation is more involved , but it can be summarized in the rule that each massive gauge boson that is connected to massive particles at _ both _ ends can be replaced by its corresponding goldstone boson individually .",
    "the only exception to this rule is that there is no @xmath24  vertex .",
    "therefore the diagram  @xmath25 depicted in figure  [ fig : aawphi - absent ] and its charge conjugate are _",
    "absent_.     + ( @xmath25 )    ( 30,20 )",
    "for a numerical illustration of the importance of `` background '' diagrams , we present results for cross sections for two _ cc@xmath21 _ final states .",
    "the calculations have been performed by means of the ` comphep ` system  @xcite .",
    "we present the results as a function of the @xmath0  invariant mass  @xmath26 .",
    "this state has a very clean signature : a muon , a positron , missing energy and no other activity in the detector .",
    "it is the smallest gauge invariant subset containing resonant @xmath9  pair production .",
    "nevertheless , it involves all topologies except one .",
    "cross sections for this final state have been calculated earlier in  @xcite .     _",
    "cc13 _ cross section ( full circles ) and signal contribution ( open circles ) , after the canonical lc cuts : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "figure  [ fig : xsect - cc13 ] shows the total cross section for _",
    "cc13 _ with the canonical cuts for the desy / ecfa linear collider study ( our results agree with  @xcite in their cuts ) .",
    "since this final state includes two neutrinos , no invariant mass cut can be applied to suppress the `` background '' . clearly , the cross section is dominated above threshold by the `` signal '' .",
    "however , an excess in this channel would be a signal for rather exotic flavor changing `` new physics '' .",
    "therefore , the standard model contribution has to be known to high accuracy , including `` background '' contributions .       _",

    "the _ cc21 _ diagrams have been calculated before in  @xcite . figure  [ fig : xsect - cc21 ] shows the total cross section for _ cc21 _ with the canonical cuts for the desy / ecfa linear collider study ( using the cuts of  @xcite we find agreement again ) . here",
    "we can also apply an invariant mass cut for the two jets .",
    "such a cut will be used in the experiment for event selection and it will suppress background diagrams . in figure  [ fig : xsect - cc21 ] we have applied the cut  @xmath36 to both signal and full cross section .",
    "again , the cross section is dominated above threshold by the `` signal '' , but for detailed studies of the vector boson couplings , the `` background '' contributions can not be neglected .      in figure",
    "[ fig : xsect - threshold ] we have enlarged the region below the @xmath2 threshold . in this region , which can be important in the search for an light intermediate mass higgs , the cross section is several times larger than the prediction from the `` signal diagrams '' only .",
    "therefore , the signal to background ratios predicted in studies based on `` signal diagrams '' only ( cf .  @xcite ) have to be reduced considerably .",
    "nevertheless , since the standard model contributions can be calculated completely , this is only a technical obstacle pointing to the need for complete calculations .",
    "sub - threshold cross section ( full circles ) and signal contribution ( open circles).,title=\"fig : \" ]   sub - threshold cross section ( full circles ) and signal contribution ( open circles).,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have proposed a complete classification of four fermion final states in @xmath0  collisions . as an application , we have demonstrated the need for full , gauge invariant calculations for obtaining reliable predictions below the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "the restriction of calculations to the `` signal diagrams '' is not sufficient .",
    "therefore the signal to background ratios presented in  @xcite turn out to be far too optimistic . nevertheless ,",
    "once a complete calculation is available , the potential of the linear collider for the intermediate mass higgs can be realized .",
    "while the results presented in this note correspond to full calculations and are gauge invariant , they can only be a first step .",
    "a monte carlo event generator will be required for more detailed experimental studies .",
    "only such a tool will allow the efficient simulation of  @xmath6 for arbitrary experimental cuts .",
    "the helicity amplitudes and the phase space for massless fermions are relatively simple .",
    "therefore , the construction of a monte carlo event generator for  @xmath6 with massless fermions will be the natural next step  @xcite towards a complete calculation .",
