    "historically outstripping heterotic string compactifications and intersecting d - brane models , the last two years have seen the main activity in the field of string phenomenology shifting towards f - theory models . in this framework",
    "some of the model building shortcomings of d - brane realizations of grand unified theories ( guts ) can be overcome .    to appreciate this ,",
    "let us recall some issues on d - brane constructions .",
    "the gauge theories are supported on d - branes , which in general can have a dimension smaller than the bulk . completely occupying our observable large scale four - dimensional world",
    ", they wrap certain sub - manifolds of the internal geometry .",
    "the matter fields are localized on the intersections of such d - branes . since the early years of so - called intersecting d - brane models , it was clear that this set - up naturally allows for semi - simple gauge groups with matter fields in the bifundamental representations",
    ". therefore , here one directly engineers the @xmath0 mssm , while leaving the unification of gauge couplings at the gut scale essentially unexplained .",
    "indeed , the gauge couplings depend on the generally different volumes of the internal cycles wrapped by the d - branes supporting each gauge factor .",
    "it was quickly realized that the construction of gut groups @xmath1 and @xmath2 was obstructed by the perturbative absence of matter fields in the @xmath3 representation of @xmath1 respectively by the absence of the top yukawa coupling @xmath4 for the @xmath2 case .",
    "these two latter features are of non - perturbative origin for orientifold models ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it was realized two years ago that the aforementioned problems with realizing simple gut groups in orientifold constructions are nicely reconciled in f - theory models on elliptically fibered calabi - yau four - folds@xcite ( see @xcite for a more phenomenological review ) .",
    "one can think of f - theory as type iib compactifications on compact complex n - dimensional manifolds @xmath5 with general @xmath6 7-branes wrapping @xmath7 cycles of @xmath5 .",
    "since the 7-branes are of real co - dimension two , the solutions to the laplace equations are of logarithmic type .",
    "therefore , the backreaction of the 7-branes on the geometry and the dilaton is always substantial and has to be taken into account . by identifying the strong - weak @xmath8 duality of the type iib superstring with the modular group of a torus , c. vafa @xcite showed that the backreaction can geometrically be taken into account by an elliptic fibration over the base @xmath5 , where the modular parameter of the fiber is identified with the axio - dilaton field of type iib .",
    "the location of the 7-branes correspond to the degeneration loci of the elliptic fibration and for supersymmetry the fibrations have to be of calabi - yau type .    due to the strong backreaction , only in a global @xmath9 limit a general f - theory model is expected to correspond to an orientifold .",
    "f - theory inherently contains some features which are non - perturbative from the orientifold point of view .",
    "this is the reason for the appearance of exceptional groups in f - theory , which by a further breaking also realize the spinor representation of a gut @xmath1 as well as the top - quark yukawa couplings @xmath4 in gut @xmath2 . for four - dimensional models ,",
    "the basis @xmath10 is a fano three - fold and the 7-branes wrap complex surfaces , i.e. four - cycle .",
    "thus , f - theory is a non - perturbative completion of type iib orientifolds where the 7-branes are completely encoded in the geometry of the elliptic fibration .",
    "the aim of this lecture is to give an introduction into some basis notions of f - theory , which essentially addresses those students , who are already familiar with d - brane constructions .",
    "it is explained why f - theory is inevitable for the correct study of type iib compactifications with d7-branes , in which sense it goes beyond the perturbative type iib superstring and how this leads to a solution of the above mentioned problems with gut models .",
    "note that this was the first of a series of two lectures on f - theory guts held at the _",
    "9th hellenic school on elementary particle physics and gravity , corfu 2009_. the second lecture focused more on the specifics of realizing four - dimensional @xmath2 guts from f - theory",
    ". please consult @xcite for more detailed lecture notes on f - theory .",
    "as a starting point , we consider type iib orientifolds compactified on a calabi - yau three - fold @xmath12 and an orientifold projection @xmath13 ( see @xcite for a review ) . here",
    "@xmath14 denotes a holomorphic involution of @xmath12 acting as @xmath15 on the khler respectively holomorphic @xmath16-form of @xmath12 .",
    "this orientifold quotient introduces an o7-plane into the theory , whose tadpole is canceled by the introduction of stacks of d7-branes wrapping various holomorphic four - cycles of @xmath12 , whose total homology class in @xmath17 is equal to the one of the o7-plane .",
    "one can now compute the ( chiral ) massless spectrum coming from the lowest excitations of open strings stretched between various pairs of d7-branes .",
    "this gives rise to gauge bosons of only unitary or orthogonal / symplectic gauge groups and in addition to matter fields transforming solely in bifundamental or ( anti)-symmetric representations of the gauge group .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that an open string has two ends .",
    "clearly , such open string excitations can never give rise to exceptional gauge groups and , as a group theoretic consequence , to matter in the spinor representation of an @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "what we have just briefly described is the construction of perturbative type iib orientifold string vacua and its short - comings when it comes to gut like structures .",
    "naively , this seems to be the end of the story .",
    "however , taking the perturbative string limit @xmath18 is , to say the least , quite questionable , if branes of ( real ) co - dimension two , such as d7-branes , are present .",
    "this becomes evident by studying the d7-brane solution in type iib supergravity @xcite , which is magnetically charged under the r - r scalar field @xmath19 with corresponding field strength @xmath20 .",
    "the space transverse to the d7-brane is two - dimensional so that it is convenient to combine the two transverse coordinates into a single complex variable @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore ones combine the type iib dilaton together with the r - r scalar field @xmath19 into a complex scalar field @xmath22 . for the d7-brane supergravity solution",
    ", @xmath23 will be a function of the complex coordinate @xmath24 , and the field equation , i.e. the laplace equation in two - dimensions , is now written as @xmath25 .",
    "this means that @xmath23 must be a holomorphic function .",
    "however not any holomorphic solution is a good solution , e.g. we must require @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore the solution must have finite energy per unit volume , and it turns out that for this purpose one needs the @xmath11 action on @xmath23 .",
    "the solution can then be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the modular invariant @xmath29-function .",
    "close to the d7-brane , i.e. at @xmath30 this solution behaves as @xmath31 which , circling once around the origin , gives rise to a monodromy @xmath32 .",
    "this monodromy reflects that the d7-brane carries @xmath19 charge one . due to this logarithmic dependence of the axio - dilaton on the transverse coordinate @xmath24 ,",
    "the backreaction of the d7-brane is so strong that one can not really control the weak - coupling regime .",
    "once the string coupling is non - zero and maybe small somewhere , it necessarily becomes large in other regions of the transverse space .",
    "however , eq . implies that @xmath33 is small close to the d7-brane so that for the gauge theory on the d7-brane we expect a weak coupling description .    as will now review , also the backreaction on",
    "the metric is strong .",
    "consider the 10-dimensional space - time metric of the d7-brane solution : @xmath34 .",
    "then the einstein equation connects the warp factor @xmath35 with the dilaton field , and one obtains the following simple relation @xmath36 .",
    "it turns out that the solution with the correct modular properties and the right asymptotic behavior far away from the d7-brane is given by @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the number of 7-branes and the @xmath39 denote their positions in the two - dimensional transverse space . expanding this function for large @xmath40",
    "one gets that @xmath41 . using this asymptotic behavior one realizes that the metric goes like @xmath42 far away from the 7-branes",
    "this means that each 7-brane leaves a deficit angle of @xmath43 in the transverse space .",
    "in fact precisely 24 7-branes are required to get the deficit angle @xmath44 of the compact two - dimensional sphere @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , there exists a supersymmetric compactification of the type iib superstring on @xmath45 with precisely 24 7-branes and a varying dilaton .",
    "so far we have only been talking about d7-branes .",
    "however , due to the @xmath11 duality symmetry there exist infinitely many different kinds of 7-branes .",
    "indeed , since there exists a doublet of two - forms @xmath46 in the ten - dimensional type iib string theory , there are not only fundamental strings and d1-branes , but also strings carrying electric charges @xmath6 , where in this notation a fundamental string is a @xmath47 string .",
    "acting with an @xmath11 transformation on the fundamental string gives @xmath48 similarly , one has a doublet of ten - dimensional scalars @xmath49 leading to magnetically charged @xmath6 7-branes , where a d7-brane ( charged only under @xmath19 ) is a @xmath47 7-brane .",
    "since a fundamental string can end on a d7-brane , @xmath11 implies that a @xmath6 string can end on a @xmath6 7-brane . in eq .",
    "we have seen that the solitonic solution of a d7-brane induces an @xmath11 monodromy @xmath50 . applying the @xmath11 symmetry",
    ", a general @xmath6 7-brane induces a monodromy @xmath51 for later purpose we consider the three 7-branes @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is now straightforward to compute the monodromy matrices for the combinations of these three 7-branes listed in table [ table_monoabc ] .",
    ".monodromies around stacks of 7-branes of types @xmath55 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     note that in particular the exceptional gauge groups @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be realized as enhanced gauge symmetries in f - theory .",
    "clearly they can not be realized by fundamental open strings of the perturbative type iib string , i.e. not just with @xmath47 strings and d7-branes .",
    "these enhancements must involve more general @xmath6 seven branes and the corresponding string - junctions between them .",
    "to get an idea how this works , we compare the geometric monodromy matrices in table [ tab : kodaireclassification ] with those listed for stacks of @xmath55 branes in table [ table_monoabc ] .",
    "it is evident that for the a - d - e series and the three fiber types @xmath59 we have a perfect match .",
    "moreover , the number of 7-branes is in all cases identical to the vanishing order of the discriminant .",
    "one can also show @xcite that the string junctions ending on the stacks of branes provide precisely the massless states to fill out the adjoint representation of a - d - e gauge groups .",
    "note that the @xmath60 series is realized by the @xmath61 7-branes , which indicates that the @xmath62 pair can be considered as the non - perturbative description of an @xmath63 plane .",
    "therefore , f - theory goes beyond the perturbative type iib orientifolds in that it allows for general @xmath6 7-branes and their corresponding @xmath6-strings .",
    "it is precisely this more general structure which realizes the exceptional gauge groups and as a consequence all their group theoretic consequences , such as matter in spinor representations of @xmath1 or the @xmath64 yukawa coupling for @xmath2 gut models .",
    "finally , to connect to the second lecture on f - theory , let us briefly comment on lower dimensional compactifications of f - theory . instead of fibering the torus over a complex one - dimensional base , one can consider fibrations over surfaces @xmath65 or three - dimensional bases @xmath10 .",
    "supersymmetry then implies that the total space should either be a calabi - yau three - fold ( for @xmath65 ) or calabi - yau four - fold ( for @xmath10 ) .",
    "one can still write down a weierstra  model , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are sections of @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the zeros of the discriminant define complex co - dimension one curves in @xmath65 respectively surfaces in @xmath10 and give the location of 7-branes . in these cases",
    ", it is more convenient to use the tate form of the elliptic fibration , as there exists a refinement of the kodaira classification , the so - called tate algorithm , which allows to determine the gauge group essentially from the vanishing order of the discriminant and the sections @xmath70 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "now it can however happen that the singularity enhances further where these co - dimension one objects intersect .",
    "similar to intersecting d - branes , this is where additional matter fields are localized .    in the case of an f - theory compactification on a smooth calabi - yau four - fold @xmath71",
    "a couple of new issues need to be considered .",
    "first , one can show that chiral matter only arises on the intersection curve between two 7-branes , if there exists a non - trivial @xmath72-form background ( m - theory point of view ) .",
    "second , one finds a non - trivial d3-brane tadpole cancellation condition , which in this case reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the euler characteristic of the smooth ( appropriately resolved ) four - fold @xmath71 .",
    "one can define a limit in which the string coupling goes to zero almost everywhere on the base .",
    "this is the so - called sen - limit @xcite , defined by rescaling @xmath75 and sending @xmath76 . in this parameterization",
    "one finds @xmath77 so that the discriminant becomes @xmath78 therefore , for @xmath76 the type iib string coupling constant @xmath79 goes to zero almost everywhere except on the locus where @xmath80 vanishes . studying the monodromies",
    "one finds a d7-brane on the locus @xmath81 and an o7-plane where @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the sen - limit defines the region in the complex structure moduli space , where f - theory is ( almost everywhere ) weakly coupled and a perturbative type iib orientifold description is justified .                  c.  vafa , nucl .",
