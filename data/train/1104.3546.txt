    "strongly - coupled plasma is a collection of free charged particles where the coulomb interaction with nearest neighbors is so strong that particles do not easily move past one another . a widely used criterion to determine whether a plasma is strongly coupled is @xmath2  @xcite , where @xmath3 is defined as the ratio of the potential energy between neighboring particles and the kinetic energy .",
    "when @xmath2 , particles move slowly and are trapped by a cage consisting of a few nearby particles . if they escape the cages gradually , particles in a strongly - coupled plasma can flow , much like a liquid  @xcite . however , if @xmath4 , nearby particles that form a cage move so little that a particle inside the cage can seldom escape the cage ; this condition is like molecules in a solid  @xcite .",
    "if a shearing stress is applied , cages in a solid are elastically deformed but can restore to their previous state , whereas cages in a liquid are disrupted and a viscous flow can develop .",
    "one type of strongly - coupled plasma is dusty plasma formed in the laboratory .",
    "a dusty plasma consists of four constituents : micron - size particles of solid matter ( dust particles ) , electrons , ions , and neutral gas atoms  @xcite .",
    "the dust particles are strongly coupled amongst themselves due to a large interparticle potential energy provided by a large particle charge  @xcite .",
    "several schemes have been used to confine charged dust particles using natural electric field inside a plasma .",
    "one of these schemes makes use of a radio - frequency plasma  @xcite , with a horizontal electrode that provides a sheath electric field that can confine and levitate dust particles in a cloud with only a few horizontal layers .",
    "if experimenters introduce only a limited number of dust particles , they can settle into just a single layer  @xcite . in these single - layer clouds ,",
    "dust particles have negligible vertical motion , so that the cloud of dust particles is often described as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system  @xcite . in this 2d cloud ,",
    "the interaction between dust particles is a repulsive yukawa potential  @xcite . due to the large length scale and",
    "the slow time scales  @xcite , dusty plasmas allow video microscopy to track individual particle motion  @xcite . in dusty plasma experiments , elasticity in solids  @xcite and viscosity in liquids",
    "@xcite has been observed and studied .",
    "however , strongly - coupled plasmas can not always be classified as purely elastic or purely viscous .",
    "dust particles experience several forces in the experiments .",
    "the electric force provides strong coupling amongst the dust particles as well as the levitation and confinement .",
    "gas friction , due to dust particles moving relative to the rarefied gas , is the primary energy loss mechanism .",
    "the gas is usually so rarefied that it represents only a small portion of the mass of the dusty plasma .",
    "gas represents @xmath5 of the mass of dust in a 3d dusty plasma experiment at @xmath6  @xcite , while 2d experiments have even less gas , with a pressure @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "there is an ion drag force due to a steady flow of ions , arising from the same dc electric fields that provide levitation and confinement of dust particles .",
    "this ion drag force is parallel to the ion flow .",
    "finally , in some experiments , laser radiation pressure forces are used to accelerate dust particles , for example to create macroscopic flows  @xcite or simply raise the kinetic temperature of the dust particles without causing a macroscopic flow  @xcite .",
    "this kind of laser heating method is one of several ways that experimenters can control @xmath3 so that the cloud of dust particles behaves like a liquid or solid  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the coulomb interaction amongst charged dust particles is the dominant mechanism for viscosity in laboratory dusty plasma experiments .",
    "viscous transport of momentum occurs when the dust particles moving relative to one another in a shearing motion collide , causing some of their momentum to be transferred across the flow .",
    "we expect that collisions involving gas atoms will contribute less to the viscosity .",
    "although the force of gas friction is effective in diminishing momentum of dust particles in the direction of their motion , there are two reasons it has little effect in transferring momentum across a flow of dust particles .",
    "first , the gas is rarefied so that it can carry much less momentum than a viscous solvent in a colloidal suspension  @xcite , for example .",
    "second , in a 2d experiment like  @xcite , a gas atom that is struck by a dust particle is usually knocked into a direction out of the dust layer , so that there is little opportunity for a dust particle to push another dust particle indirectly through collisions with a gas atom .    here , we will refer to the viscosity as the static viscosity @xmath0 to distinguish it from viscoelasticity .",
    "in the literature of dusty plasmas , the static viscosity @xmath0 has been measured experimentally  @xcite and quantified in simulations  @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to quantify the static viscosity .",
    "if there is a macroscopic velocity shear , the static viscosity can be calculated from the velocity flow profile  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is no macroscopic velocity shear , the microscopic shear associated with the random motion of particles can be used to calculate the static viscosity using the green - kubo relation  @xcite .",
    "viscoelasticity is a property of materials that exhibit both liquid - like viscous and solid - like elastic characteristics  @xcite .",
    "most materials in reality are viscoelastic , such as wood , synthetic polymers , and human tissue  @xcite .",
    "viscous effects correspond to energy dissipation , while elastic effects corresponds to energy storage . in general ,",
    "liquids exhibit mostly viscous effects at large spatial and temporal scales , but they exhibit some elastic effects at small spatial and temporal scales  @xcite .    to characterize viscoelasticity quantitatively , it is common to use either the frequency - dependent viscosity @xmath8 or the wave - number - dependent viscosity @xmath1 .",
    "the latter characterizes materials at different length scales , and was introduced by theorists performing simulations  @xcite .",
    "the static viscosity @xmath0 is the hydrodynamic limit of the wave - number - dependent viscosity @xmath1 when @xmath9 . in considering this limit , the relevant characteristic length scale for @xmath10 is the interparticle distance , which is often measured as the lattice constant @xmath11 of a perfect crystal .",
    "viscoelasticity of strongly - coupled plasmas has been studied theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the few experiments that have been reported for viscoelasticity of dusty plasma include a descriptive presentation  @xcite and a characterization using a correlation function of the microscopic motion of dust particles  @xcite .",
    "in our recent 2d experiment  @xcite , a single horizontal layer of electrically charged dust particles was levitated in a glow - discharge plasma .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the dust cloud was raised by laser heating  @xcite .",
    "viewing from above , we recorded movies of particle motion , then calculated particle positions and tracked them to calculate their velocities . based on the trajectories of particles ,",
    "the wave - number - dependent viscosity @xmath1 of the 2d dusty plasma was quantified using an expression we derived that accounts for gas friction .    in simulations ,",
    "the viscoelasticity of both 2d  @xcite and 3d strongly - coupled plasmas  @xcite have been studied recently . in this paper",
    ", we carry out further simulations for two purposes : to validate the @xmath1 calculation method taking into account gas friction , as presented in  @xcite , and to assess the accuracy of the green - kubo relation for dusty plasmas with a modest level of gas friction",
    ".    simulations of strongly - coupled plasmas usually use the molecular dynamical ( md ) method  @xcite .",
    "each particle is tracked individually , unlike the case of particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , where aggregations of particles are simulated by a hypothetical super - particle  @xcite .",
    "tracking individual particles is suitable because otherwise the dominant effects of strong particle - particle coulomb interactions would be lost .",
    "another difference is that in md simulations , as compared to pic simulations , poisson s equation is not solved .",
    "the only equation that is solved is the equation of motion for each particle , which is integrated to track particle trajectories .",
    "the result of the md simulation is a record of all particle positions and velocities , which is the same kind of data that are produced in dusty plasma experiments .",
    "the interparticle interaction that is assumed in md simulations of strongly - coupled dusty plasmas is a repulsive yukawa potential  @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the charge on dust particles , @xmath14 is the debye length , and @xmath15 is the distance between the @xmath16th and @xmath17th particles .",
    "we list here additional parameters for the dusty plasma cloud .",
    "because the dust cloud is 2d , we use an areal number density @xmath18 and an areal mass density @xmath19 for the cloud , where @xmath20 is the dust particle mass .",
    "we note that while the units for mass density and viscosity are different in 2d and 3d , the units are the same for the kinematic viscosity  @xcite , @xmath21 .",
    "distances between dust particles are characterized by both the lattice constant @xmath11 for a crystal or the 2d wigner - seitz radius @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "time scales for collective motion are characterized by the nominal 2d dusty plasma frequency  @xcite @xmath23 .",
    "gas friction is characterized by the damping rate @xmath24 , which is the ratio of the gas friction force and the dust particle s momentum .",
    "we will discuss how to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath1 in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we will discuss our two md simulation methods , langevin and frictionless . in sec .",
    "iv , we will report new simulation data for @xmath1 of 2d strongly - coupled dusty plasmas",
    ". we will validate our analysis method  @xcite for calculating @xmath1 in 2d strongly - coupled plasma with gas friction .",
    "we will also test the accuracy of the green - kubo relation with a modest level of gas friction as in our experiment .",
    "the green - kubo relation is widely used for calculating the static viscosity @xmath0 , based on the random motion of particles .",
    "this method is used when there is no macroscopic velocity shear .",
    "the green - kubo approach assumes linear microscopic fluctuations and equilibrium fields in the system  @xcite .",
    "the assumptions of this approach are similar to those for the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite .",
    "previously , the green - kubo relation was generally used with data from frictionless simulations  @xcite . to calculate the static viscosity ,",
    "first we calculate the stress autocorrelation function ( sacf ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the shearing stress @xmath27,}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are indices for different particles , @xmath28 is the total number of particles of mass @xmath20 , @xmath29 is the position of particle @xmath16 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the interparticle potential .",
    "second , we calculate the static viscosity @xmath0 from the green - kubo relation  @xcite , @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the simulation volume , which is replaced by the area of the simulation box for 2d simulations like those reported here .    the green - kubo relation , eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) , is intended for use in equilibrium systems , but in this paper we will assess whether it can also be used in systems with a modest level of gas friction as in our experiment  @xcite .",
    "the dust particles in an experiment experience gas friction , in addition to collisions amongst themselves , whereas only the latter are modeled in the green - kubo relation",
    ". we will carry out simulations , with and without friction , and verify that eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) yields the same result in both cases .",
    "the wave - number - dependent viscosity @xmath1 characterizes viscous effects at different length scales .",
    "a method of calculating @xmath1 from the trajectories of random motion of molecules in liquids has been developed  @xcite . in calculating @xmath1 using this method ,",
    "one starts with particle trajectories , such as @xmath36 and the perpendicular velocity @xmath37 for the @xmath16th particle .",
    "these are used to calculate the transverse current , @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the normalized transverse current autocorrelation function  @xcite ( tcaf ) is then calculated as @xmath39 where the wave vector @xmath10 is parallel to the @xmath40 axis .",
    "( here , @xmath10 serves only as a fourier transform variable , and is not intended to characterize any waves . ) the wave - number - dependent viscosity of frictionless systems is calculated  @xcite using @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a time integral representing the area under the tcaf after normalizing the tcaf to have a value of unity at @xmath43 .",
    "generally , @xmath1 diminishes gradually as @xmath10 increases , meaning that viscous effects gradually diminish at shorter length scales .    in  @xcite",
    ", we generalized this expression as @xmath44/k^2}\\ ] ] to account for the friction of gas drag @xmath24 acting on dust particles .",
    "as in eq.([etakold ] ) , the integral @xmath42 is a function of @xmath10 . our derivation of eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) was provided in the supplementary material of  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will carry out simulation tests to validate the use of eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) for a wide range of @xmath10 .",
    "this validation test will be performed for the modest level of gas friction @xmath24 in our experiment  @xcite .",
    "the tcaf measures the memory of transverse current , which reflects the decay of microscopic velocity shear .",
    "the shear decay can be caused by several mechanism in 2d dusty plasma clouds , such as coulomb collisions amongst dust particles and the friction due to gas drag .",
    "we will study how gas friction affects the tcaf later .",
    "in order to test the effects of gas friction , we will compare the results of two simulations : a langevin md simulation with friction , and a frictionless equilibrium md simulation .",
    "our two simulation methods are the same in many respects .",
    "both use a binary interparticle interaction with a yukawa pair potential . in both simulations ,",
    "particles are only allowed to move in a single 2d plane .",
    "conditions remained steady during each simulation run .",
    "for both simulations , the parameters we used were @xmath45 particles in a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the box had sides @xmath46 .",
    "the integration time step was @xmath47 , and simulation data were recorded for a time duration of @xmath48 after a steady state was reached .",
    "both of our simulations were performed at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are the same values as in our experiment  @xcite .",
    "our langevin md simulation takes into account the dissipation due to gas friction .",
    "the equation of motion that is integrated in the langevin simulation is  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a frictional drag and @xmath53 is a random force .",
    "there is no thermostat to adjust the temperature ; instead the temperature is established by choosing the magnitude of @xmath53 . here , we chose the experimental value @xmath54  @xcite . note that this gas friction level is modest , i.e. , the dust particle motion is underdamped , since @xmath55 .",
    "our frictionless equilibrium md simulation  @xcite has no gas friction in the equation of motion @xmath56 a nos - hoover thermostat is applied to maintain a desired temperature @xcite .",
    "trajectories @xmath57 are found by integrating eq .",
    "( [ ldmotion ] ) or ( [ mdmotion ] ) for all particles .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  1 from the frictionless md simulation .",
    "comparing the results from the two simulations , fig .  2 , we can see how friction speeds the loss of memory of the system s microscopic shearing motion .",
    "the memory of the shearing motion is indicated by the decay of the tcaf .    as expected  @xcite , in the typical hydrodynamic limit of long length scales , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the tcaf is just a monotonic decay from unity to zero without any oscillations  @xcite .",
    "we find that at the same hydrodynamic length scale , the tcaf decays much faster with friction than without , indicating that in experimental dusty plasmas gas friction plays an important role in shear decay in large length scales .    when the wave number @xmath10 is slightly larger , in the intermediate regime between the hydrodynamic and viscoelastic regimes , fig .",
    "2(b ) , the difference in tcaf between frictional and frictionless is smaller .",
    "the integral of the frictional tcaf is about a half of that for the frictionless tcaf , as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "this integral corresponds to @xmath42 , as in eq .",
    "( [ etakold ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) .",
    "when the wave number @xmath10 is even larger , in the viscoelastic regime , the tcaf oscillates around zero after its decay due to the elastic effects , fig .",
    "2(c ) . in this viscoelastic regime",
    ", there is little difference between the tcaf from the two simulations , indicating that at smaller length scales , gas friction does not contribute much to shear decay .",
    "the friction plays a larger role in tcaf at larger length scales than smaller length scales .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 using eq .",
    "( [ etakold ] ) or ( [ etak ] ) requires choosing an upper limit in the time integral of tcaf @xmath58 .",
    "an infinite time is of course impractical for both experiments and simulations , so for a finite value we chose @xmath59 , the time of the first upward zero crossing of the tcaf  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "this choice is suitable for two reasons : first , it is sufficiently long to retain both viscous and elastic effects ; second , we found that contributions to the integral after @xmath59 are negligible , for a tcaf that is not noisy .",
    "the calculation result for @xmath1 is not very sensitive to the chosen upper limit .",
    "extending the limit to a higher value would only cause a limited effect on the value of the integral .",
    "results for the wave - number - dependent viscosity @xmath1 are presented in fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) for both simulations .",
    "we find an agreement in the values of @xmath1 for the frictionless and langevin simulations .",
    "this agreement can be seen by comparing the circles in fig .",
    "3(b ) for the frictionless simulation with eq .  ( [ etakold ] ) , and the triangles in fig .",
    "3(c ) for the langevin simulation with eq .  ( [ etak ] ) .",
    "there is not only a qualitative agreement in the downward trend as the wave number @xmath10 increases , but also a quantitative agreement .",
    "this quantitative agreement is most easily seen by fitting the calculated @xmath1 to the pad approximant of  @xcite and comparing the fit parameters , as indicated in fig .  3 for the smooth curves .",
    "this agreement leads us to our first chief result : a validation of eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) for computing @xmath1 in the presence of gas friction .",
    "since the two simulations were performed for the same values of @xmath3 and @xmath60 , an agreement indicates that eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) is valid . if there had been a discrepancy between the circles in fig .",
    "3(b ) and the triangles in fig .",
    "3(c ) , we would question whether eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) is valid .",
    "we gain confidence in the validity of eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) by the lack of any significant discrepancy in the two results .",
    "the importance of correcting for friction , in eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) , is demonstrated in fig .",
    "if we use eq .",
    "( [ etakold ] ) instead , the presence of friction leads to an exaggerated value for @xmath1 , as seen by comparing the two sets of data in fig .",
    "this exaggeration is most extreme at small wave numbers ( where the effect of friction is greatest , as we found in sec .",
    "iv  a for the tcaf ) .      to determine whether the green - kubo relation , eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) , still provides an accurate calculation of static viscosity @xmath0 of a 2d yukawa liquid , in the presence of a modest level of gas friction , we performed a test of eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) comparing @xmath0 computed from our frictional langevin simulation and our frictionless simulation .",
    "these results for the normalized kinematic static viscosity are @xmath61 for the frictionless simulation , and @xmath62 for the langevin simulation with friction .",
    "these values are also shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) as star symbols . noting that these results are in agreement within the uncertainty , we conclude that the green - kubo relation remains accurate , at least with a modest level of gas friction , for a 2d yukawa liquid at the value @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ".    a further confirmation of the accuracy of the green - kubo relation when used with modest levels of friction can be found by examining our @xmath1 in fig .",
    "we note an agreement of @xmath1 as @xmath9 with @xmath0 from the green - kubo relation .",
    "this agreement is significant because @xmath1 is computed from the tcaf , which is unrelated to the green - kubo relation used to compute @xmath0 .",
    "we can provide two intuitive suggestions to explain the accuracy of the green - kubo relation in the presence of a modest level of gas friction .",
    "first , we note that the gas friction that we have considered is so small that @xmath63 .",
    "this inequality demonstrates that frictional effects will in general be much smaller than effects arising from particle charge as measured by @xmath64 .",
    "second , the tcaf in fig .  2 showed us that gas friction has the least effect on motion at small length scales , and dynamical information at these small length scales are also reflected in the green - kubo relation because it is based only on fluctuations of individual particle motion .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that friction will affect the static viscosity computed using the green - kubo relation in other parameter regimes .",
    "in fact , for a 3d yukawa langevin simulation at a much lower @xmath65 , ramazanov and dzhumagulova found that @xmath0 computed using the green - kubo relation diminishes as the friction was raised to a very high level  @xcite .",
    "motivated by experiments with 2d clouds of charged dust particles suspended in a plasma , we carried out two types of simulations , with and without gas friction .",
    "we validated the newly - introduced eq .",
    "( [ etak ] ) for calculating @xmath1 as a measure of viscoelasticity , in the presence of gas friction .",
    "we also verified that the green - kubo relation can accurately measure the static viscosity @xmath0 of the 2d collection of charged dust particles even when they experience gas friction .",
    "the level of gas friction we considered was at a low level @xmath63 , and the coupling was moderate with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , both as in our recent experiment  @xcite ."
