    "many examples of hopf algebras based on combinatorial structures are known . among these , algebras based on permutations and planar binary trees play a prominent role , and arise in seemingly unrelated contexts  @xcite . as hopf algebras , both are noncommutative and non cocommutative , and in fact self - dual .",

    "it is easily checked that @xmath301 is actually given by the same formula as the usual coproduct of @xmath152 , that is @xmath302    the dual twisted hopf algebra , denoted by @xmath303 , is isomorphic to @xmath151 as a algebra .",
    "if we denote by @xmath304 the dual basis of @xmath305 , @xmath306 , and @xmath303 is freely generated by the @xmath307 , whose coproduct is @xmath308    as above , @xmath301 is an algebra morphism @xmath309 where @xmath310 is again defined by equation  ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "the previous constructions can be lifted to @xmath95 . recall that @xmath311 is an algebra homomorphism @xmath312 ,",
    "which is in fact induced by the specialization @xmath313 of the underlying free variables @xmath314 to @xmath293-commuting variables @xmath315 .",
    "the coproduct of @xmath95 is also defined by @xmath316 where @xmath317 and @xmath318 are two mutually commuting copies of @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "if instead one sets @xmath319 , one obtains again a twisted hopf algebra structure @xmath320 on @xmath95 , for which @xmath104 is a homomorphism .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath321 for @xmath322 and @xmath323 .",
    "then , the coproduct @xmath324 defines a twisted hopf algebra structure .",
    "it is explictly given in the basis @xmath325 by @xmath326 where @xmath327 is the number of inversions of @xmath60 with one element in @xmath66 and the other in @xmath67 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath301 is an algebra morphism with values in the twisted tensor product of graded algebras @xmath328 where @xmath329 and @xmath330 for homogeneous elements @xmath299 , @xmath300 .",
    "the map @xmath331 defined by @xmath332 is a morphism of twisted hopf algebras .",

    "then , for @xmath340 , @xmath301 becomes cocommutative , and it is easily shown that the resulting hopf algebra is isomorphic to @xmath91 .",
    "however , it follows from  @xcite that for generic @xmath293 , the hopf algebras defined in this way are all isomorphic to @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests to interpret @xmath95 as a kind of quantum group : it would be the generic element of a quantum deformation of the enveloping algebra @xmath341 .",
    "similar considerations apply to various examples , in particular to the loday - ronco algebra @xmath342 , whose commutative version obtained in  @xcite can be quantized in the same way as @xmath152 , by means of @xmath293-commuting variables  @xcite",
    ".    there is another way to obtain @xmath152 from @xmath95 : it is known  @xcite that @xmath152 is isomorphic to the image of @xmath343 in the hypoplactic algebra @xmath344 $ ] .",
    "one may then ask whether there exist a @xmath293-analogue of the hypoplactic congruence leading directly to @xmath290 .",
    "recall that the hypoplactic congruence can be presented as the bi - sylvester congruence : @xmath345 with @xmath346 .",
    "a natural @xmath293-analogue , compatible with the above @xmath293-commutation is @xmath347 with @xmath346 .",
    "then , we have    the image of @xmath343 under the natural projection @xmath348 is isomorphic to @xmath290 as an algebra , and also as a twisted hopf algebra for the coproduct @xmath349 , @xmath317 and @xmath318 being @xmath293-commuting alphabets .    moreover , if one only takes the sylvester congruence @xmath350 the quotient @xmath343 under the natural projection @xmath351 is isomorphic to the hopf algebra of planar binary trees of loday and ronco  @xcite .",
    "the previous construction provides natural twisted @xmath293-analogues of this hopf algebra .",
    "indeed , if one defines the @xmath293-sylvester congruence as @xmath352 then    the image of @xmath343 under the natural projection @xmath353 is a twisted hopf algebra , with basis indexed by planar binary trees .",
