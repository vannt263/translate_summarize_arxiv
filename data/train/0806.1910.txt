    "for many applications of astronomical photometry , an accurate absolute calibration in physical units and at multiple wavelengths is critical .",
    "previous calibrations have made use of two basic approaches ( rieke et al .",
    "1985 ) . in direct calibrations ,",
    "measurements are made of celestial sources in ways allowing the signals to be compared directly ( if sometimes through a long chain of measurements ) with signals from calibrated emitters . for indirect calibrations , direct calibrations at wavelengths well removed from those of interest",
    "are interpolated or extrapolated through physical modeling of astronomical sources . for direct calibrations , rigorous error analysis is possible , although there is always a risk of systematic terms that are not captured .",
    "error analysis is far more difficult for indirect calibrations , since the systematic errors in theoretical modeling are often not apparent and there is usually no rigorous way to quantify the errors .",
    "therefore , indirect calibrations must be used with caution until they have been confirmed by other indirect approaches or , better , by direct ones .",
    "infrared calibrations have often included some aspect of indirect calibration by extrapolating from the high quality visible direct calibrations .",
    "there are now high quality direct calibrations in the infrared , so the extrapolations can be tested . in this work ,",
    "we start with the infrared calibrations , test their internal consistency , and then examine the consequences for extrapolation from them into the visible .",
    "this approach is preferred in principle because stellar behavior is relatively simple in the infrared ( e.g. , small temperature uncertainties have little effect on the shape of a nearly rayleigh - jeans spectrum for stars of the temperatures considered here ) .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m band of the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) achieves high photometric accuracy - with typical errors an order of magnitude smaller than those previously achieved at similar wavelengths ( rieke et al .",
    "2004 ; engelbracht et al .",
    "the infrared array camera ( irac ) also is providing a large body of accurate and homogeneous photometry in the 3 - 8@xmath3 m range ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ; reach et al .",
    "in addition , a new absolute calibration of unprecedented accuracy is now available in the thermal infrared ( price et al .",
    "these advances make it both desirable and feasible to establish a very accurate calibration of the mips photometry at this wavelength and to provide guidelines to tie it in consistently with photometry at shorter wavelengths .",
    "bessell ( 2005 ) has reviewed photometry in general , but with only a few comments on the infrared .",
    "price ( 2004 ) has reviewed infrared calibrations .",
    "his review concentrates on a huge body of work by cohen , walker , witteborn , price , and other co - workers on this topic .",
    "the review states that the results are `` in substantial disagreement with previous direct calibrations , '' thus leaving open the question of possible undetected systematic errors .",
    "in addition , the review points out a number of discrepancies between the measured properties of the sun ( e.g. , thuillier et al .",
    "2003 ) and measurements of solar analog stars , which indicate possible issues in the photometric system .    the availability of large and homogeneous sets of data such as the hipparcos photometric catalog ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) and the 2mass survey ( cutri et al . 2003 ) opens new possibilities to probe these issues and to improve calibrations , as well as providing a solid foundation to extend calibrations uniformly over the entire sky .",
    "doing so is the goal of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review measurements of the absolute flux from vega at 2.22 and 10.6@xmath0 m , and the extrapolation of these measurements to the mips effective wavelength of 23.675@xmath0 m . in section 3",
    ", we discuss an independent approach to calibration using the solar analog method introduced by harold johnson ( 1965a ) . in section 4 , we show explicitly the discrepancy in the vega - based visible calibration and the infrared one . in section 5 ,",
    "we recommend adjustments to the absolute calibration of other photometric systems to bring them into agreement with the work reported here .",
    "the paper is summarized in section 6 .",
    "those not wishing to plow through the details can go to that section for a summary of the useful results , which include recommendations for an absolute calibration accurate to 2% or better across the near and mid infrared .",
    "traditionally , absolute calibration systems have been referred to a `` zero point '' of a magnitude system , usually defined by the spectral energy distributions of a stars .",
    "the johnson / arizona system defined the zero point as an average of the colors of a number of a stars , not just those of vega , and as a result the magnitude of vega is slightly positive ( @xmath1 0.02 ) at most bands .",
    "this situation has caused confusion because some have used vega by itself to define zero magnitude , introducing a small offset in nominally similar systems .",
    "further complications arise for the wavelengths of interest for this paper because of the contribution of the vega debris system to the fluxes from this star beyond 10@xmath0 m ( e.g. , aumann et al .",
    "in addition , vega is a rapidly rotating pole - on star with a significant temperature gradient ( @xmath1 1500k ) from its pole to its equator ( gulliver et al .",
    "1994 ; aufdenberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , so its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can differ from conventional models that assume a non - rotating star with a single surface temperature .    nonetheless , there is a large body of data based on vega .",
    "fortunately , in the infrared the differences in photospheric colors due to the rapid rotation and other modeling uncertainties are small ( see price 2004 , figure 5 and section 4 below ) .",
    "we therefore quote the results relative to the flux density of `` vega '' , a mythical star with a spectral energy distribution given by a kurucz 1993 model spectrum of an a0 star ( kurucz 2005 ) with t@xmath4 = 9550 , log g = 3.95 , log z = -0.5 , and normalized to measurements of vega that are corrected , if necessary , for the infrared excess from the debris disk around this star .",
    "this convention maintains continuity with the large existing body of infrared photometry . we have compared this model with the 2003 version ( kurucz 2005 ) ; the differences at photometric resolution and at wavelengths longer than 1@xmath0 m are less than 0.1% , while the v - k color is 0.2% bluer with the newer model , again a negligible difference for our purposes .",
    "thus , the kurucz vega models provide a stable reference baseline in the infrared .",
    "we provide the specific model we have used in electronic form so it can be utilized explicitly in future work or in adjustments to the calibration ( appendix a ) . in the following , we place `` vega '' in quotes because the zero point of the system is defined by an idealized version of this star .      in this subsection , we discuss absolute calibrations near 10@xmath0 m and use them to establish a `` best '' value of 35.03 @xmath5 0.30 jy for the monochromatic flux density of `` vega '' at 10.6@xmath0 m .",
    "we also show that the absolute measurements at 21@xmath0 m are consistent with this value and derive a monochromatic flux density for `` vega '' at the effective or mean wavelength of the mips 24@xmath0 m band .    for reasons given in the introduction , we place highest weight on direct calibrations in the thermal infrared .",
    "such measurements are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the two most accurate sets of measurements - rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and midcourse space experiment ( msx ) - have estimated errors of 3% ( rieke et al .",
    "1985 ) or @xmath2 0.6% ( price et al . 2004 ) near 10@xmath0 m and are in excellent agreement to within these errors .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) review previous work ( becklin et al .",
    "1973 ; low and rieke 1974 ) and show it agrees closely with their calibration , well within the errors of order 7% quoted for the earlier work .",
    "the solar analog calibration in this work agrees to within @xmath21.5% , as does another calibration conducted in support of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) ( both to be discussed below ) .",
    "the consistency of these independent determinations indicates that there are no major systematic errors . at 21@xmath0 m",
    ", the agreement between the msx calibration and previous work is also excellent although the errors estimated for the rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) measurements are about 7% . even though rieke et al . reported a direct measurement at this wavelength",
    ", they based the recommended calibration on an extrapolation from the 10.6@xmath0 m calibration because they felt it was more accurate .    to obtain the best possible calibration in the mid - infrared , we therefore need an optimum way to combine the measurement of rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , the three near 10@xmath3 m from price et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and the solar analog determination from this work .",
    "we do so at a wavelength of 10.6@xmath0 m , using the `` vega '' spectral energy distribution as the means to interpolate or extrapolate to the same wavelength and thus to relate the measurements to each other . that is , the calibration is relative to the normalization in price ( 2004 ) , figure 5 . however , this figure plots the calibration of rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) incorrectly .",
    "the figure shows the proposed zero point of the photometric system as if vega were zero magnitude but rieke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) set vega to a magnitude of 0.02 .",
    "that is , the measurement of vega should be 0.02 lower than plotted , and hence in even better agreement with the msx values than indicated ( price , private communication ) .",
    "various ways to combine the data are indicated in table 1 . for extrapolating to other wavelengths , we define the `` monochromatic '' flux density to be proportional to the average over a 1% spectral bandwidth of @xmath6 f@xmath7 = @xmath8 f@xmath9 .",
    "for example , we determine the msx value starting from the n band flux density in tables 1 and 2 of cohen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , extrapolated to 10.6@xmath3 m according to the `` vega '' sed .",
    "we used the standard deviation of the biases in bands a , c , and d in table 9 of price et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to estimate a 1.1% rms scatter and then combined this value with the quoted uncertainties to compute a weighted average of the biases , which was used to adjust the cohen et al .",
    "value for the flux density .    in the following section , we use the rieke et al . and msx weighted average as the basis to project the 10.6@xmath0 m calibration back to 2.22@xmath0 m , for comparison with direct measurements there . in section 3.3.3 ,",
    "we use the direct calibration at 2.22@xmath0 m , the irac 8@xmath0 m measurements of solar - type stars , and the spectral energy distribution of the sun to obtain the independent new calibration listed as solar analog ( this work ) .",
    "we also tabulate the calibration of hammersley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , conducted in support of the iso mission .",
    "they used the 1993 kurucz model of vega to extrapolate from k - band measurements , and quoted a photospheric flux density from this model at 10.47@xmath3 m .",
    "we have corrected their value to 10.6@xmath3 m and reduced it by 1.29% to correct for the k - band excess of vega ( absil et al .",
    "it then agrees excellently with the other determinations .",
    "hammersley et al .",
    "show that their measurements of stars within this system are also in close agreement with previous measurements of the same stars .",
    "we have not included this calibration in our average because it is not clear how to evaluate the errors , but they would appear to be similar to those of most of the other entries .",
    "all of the approaches are consistent with the adopted value of 35.03 jy for the monochromatic flux density of `` vega '' at 10.6@xmath0 m .",
    "we quote a slightly increased error from the pure weighted average value to allow for any residual systematic errors .",
    "a measure of the degree of agreement is that the calibration ignoring the msx result is accurate to 2% and agrees with the msx calibration to within 1% .",
    "we can now compute that the corresponding `` vega '' flux density at 23.675@xmath0 m ( the mean wavelength of the mips band ) is 7.15 @xmath5 0.11 jy , where we have assigned a 1.5% error to allow for any issue in propagating the calibration to 24@xmath0 m .",
    "msx also obtained a calibration at 21.3@xmath0 m , which is equivalent to a `` vega '' flux density at 23.675@xmath0 m of 7.19 @xmath5 0.11 jy , i.e. , is fully consistent with our extrapolation from 10.6@xmath0 m . we take the average value of 7.17 @xmath5 0.11 jy = 3.835 x 10@xmath10 w @xmath11 @xmath3m@xmath12 as the `` best '' estimate ; we have not decreased the error bar in the average because the two determinations are not completely independent .",
    "this subsection addresses tying the absolute measurement at 10.6@xmath0 m to direct calibrations of vega near 2@xmath0 m . since the high - weight calibrations are at 2.20 and 2.25@xmath0 m ( blackwell et al .",
    "1983 ; selby et al . 1983",
    "; booth et al .",
    "1989 ) , we correct all of them to 2.22@xmath0 m ; this wavelength has the further advantage that it is well - removed from strong spectral absorptions in both a and g stars .",
    "figure 5 of price ( 2004 ) demonstrates that the predictions of a - star models are very similar in spectral shape between 2 and 24@xmath0 m , and we obtain a similar result comparing the 1993 and 2003 kurucz models for vega . at shorter wavelengths",
    ", there can be slight deviations of models .",
    "however , the comparison of calibrations at 2 and 10@xmath0 m and interpolations within this range should be robust .",
    "the flux density from `` vega '' at 2.22@xmath0 m is predicted to be 649 jy , using the kurucz model normalized at 10.6@xmath0 m to the `` rieke plus msx '' value .",
    "we assign a 1.5% error to this estimate to include any issues in propagating it from 10.6@xmath0 m .",
    "this value is compared with the direct measurements of vega by walker ( 1969 ) , selby et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , blackwell et al . (",
    "1983 ) , and booth et al .",
    "( 1989 ) in table 2 .",
    "this list of measurements represents all the absolute calibrations in the literature except those based in some way on extrapolating the vega spectrum ( or , in the case of campins et al .",
    "( 1985 ) that are revised in this work ) .",
    "all the reported measurements in this table have been corrected to a wavelength of 2.22@xmath0 m according to the kurucz model spectrum of vega .",
    "absil et al .",
    "( 2006 ) report interferometric measurements of vega at 2@xmath0 m that show it has an excess of 1.29% @xmath5 0.19% within a field of diameter 2 `` , presumably due to a hot inner circumstellar disk ( see also ciardi et al .",
    "we have corrected the direct measurements downward by 1.29% to remove the effects of this disk .",
    "it is unlikely that the output of the disk exceeds this value significantly .",
    "for example , the excess of @xmath13 4% observed by msx in bands c and d at 12.1 and 14.7@xmath0 m ( price et al .",
    "2004 , table 4 ) and an upper limit to the color temperature for the excess of 2000k ( compare absil et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) predict an excess above the photosphere of 0.9% at 2.2@xmath0 m .",
    "this rough upper limit is very close to the measured excess at this wavelength , i.e. , there is no missing flux that might lie outside the 2 '' field . although there are accurate direct measurements of the flux from vega at other infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , mountain et al .",
    "1985 ) , the lack of detailed understanding of the behavior of the circumstellar material makes it problematic to interpret these measurements to the level of accuracy that can be achieved at 2@xmath3 m .    nonetheless , because the extent and other aspects of the correction may be more uncertain than indicated by the nominal error bar , we have assigned an error of one percentage point to the correction .",
    "the resulting value is 645 @xmath5 15 jy for the directly measured flux density from the vega photosphere at 2.22@xmath0 m .",
    "the agreement with the value extrapolated from 10.6@xmath0 m is virtually perfect .",
    "we combine the two values to determine a `` best '' calibration .    the central result from this section",
    "is captured in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the theoretical spectral energy distribution of `` vega '' links the accurate absolute measurements of this pseudo - star at 2.22 and 10.6@xmath0 m well .",
    "because consistent values are obtained in distinct calibrations with completely different chains of measurements and assumptions , this agreement appears not to be undermined by any plausible systematic errors .",
    "the uncertainties in our final derived flux densities for this `` star '' are less than 1.5% at both wavelengths .",
    "a further test of the `` vega''-based calibration is to show that an approach based on a different stellar type is consistent with it . to generate this new calibration",

    "we assign a 5% uncertainty to the measurements beyond 12@xmath3 m as represented by the engelke ( 1992 ) function .",

    "the solar temperature structure appears to have a minimum of @xmath1 4000k near a depth of 500 km in the photosphere , with an overlying 1500 km thick , 7000k plateau in the mechanically heated chromosphere .",
    "however , the analysis of carbon monoxide ( co ) lines indicates a very cool brightness temperature ( @xmath1 3700k ) at the extreme edge of the solar disk , where the slanted line of sight probes into the low chromosphere ( see ayres et al .",

    "all of the approaches discussed above for describing the measurements or modeling the solar output agree excellently in the 2 to 4@xmath3 m region .",
    "there are modest divergences at longer wavelengths ( particularly beyond 10@xmath3 m ) , but still generally within the expected errors .",
    "we will therefore use photometry of solar - type stars to help decide among the possibilities .",

    "we convolved the kurucz a star spectral energy distribution and the various models for the sun with these functions .",
    "the relative responses to the a - star and solar spectra can then be used to calculate the synthetic colors provided in table 3 .      for comparison with the synthetic colors , we determine accurate averages for the measured stellar colors in this subsection .",
    "we emphasize the use of large sets of homogeneous measurements ( hipparcos , 2mass , and homogeneous data sets with mips and irac ) .",
    "an essential aspect of these comparisons is the linearity of mips and irac over the range of the observations , which we demonstrate in appendix b is adequate for our needs .",
    "we first discuss our procedures at 8@xmath3 m ( further details are in appendix c ) . the existing calibration of the irac photometry is relative to `` vega '' as the zero point , as described by reach et al .",
    "we used their stated zero point to compare their assumed flux density for `` vega '' with ours .",
    "we first compute the monochromatic flux density at 7.872@xmath0 m , and then apply their recommended color correction of 1.042 . extrapolating from the 2.22@xmath3 m calibration",
    "we find a value 1.2% brighter than theirs , while extrapolating from 10.6@xmath0 m we find one that is 1.7% brighter .",
    "thus , to put their calibration on the same overall scale as is recommended here , an upward adjustment of about 1.5% is required .",
    "we have used the formation & evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) delivery 3 data products ( nasa / ipac infrared science archive 2007 ) for a solar analog calibration at 8@xmath0 m .",
    "we also need stars with very homogeneous near infrared photometry .",
    "we therefore required that each star have 2mass measurements of `` a '' quality in all three bands ( jhk ) , and that they all be measured in the `` read 1 '' mode ( see appendix d ) .",
    "in addition , we used the hipparcos photometry at v to compute v - k colors and rejected any star departing by more than 0.10 magnitudes from the standard color .",
    "the final sample is listed in table c1 , and the irac reductions are described in appendix c.    to look for intrinsic scatter in the stellar colors , we averaged the 2mass j , h , and @xmath25 measurements to a single `` @xmath26 '' value ( see appendix c ) . we have computed the ratio of 2.2@xmath0 m to 8@xmath0 m flux densities for the stars in table c1 , using the @xmath27 magnitudes .",
    "we find that the rms scatter is only 2.05% .",
    "this value is smaller than would have been predicted from the combination of the uncertainties in the @xmath27 magnitudes and in the irac 8@xmath0 m flux densities .",

    "we now extend the solar analog method to 24@xmath3 m , to test the various alternatives for the solar sed in this spectral region . we determine zero color at 24@xmath3 m by averaging the measurements of a large number of a stars , similar in spirit to the original a - star - based zero point ( johnson and morgan 1953 ) .",
    "in our situation , the approach has a number of virtues .",
    "first , because it uses averages of many measurements , it achieves high accuracy in the comparison .",

    "appendix c also describes our reduction procedures at 24@xmath3 m in detail .",
    "we have fitted a gaussian to the distribution of @xmath27 over 24@xmath3 m flux density ratios ( normalized to one ) for our a star sample .",
    "the standard deviation is 0.048 ( we have excluded hd 172728 from the fits because its low values for two measurements imply a possible problem with the 2mass measurement and also the two stars with the highest ratios , hd 11413 and hd 92845 , since they may have weak excess emission ) . by taking the quadratic difference of the fitted standard deviation and the estimated errors in the 24@xmath0 m and @xmath27 values , we find a residual uncertainty term of 3% .",
    "this value is an upper limit to the intrinsic star - to - star rms differences in k@xmath24 - [ 24 ] photospheric color .",
    "because the intrinsic scatter appears to be small , we assume that the scatter in the colors is dominated by measurement errors and it is appropriate to reduce the uncertainties by averaging . we found that attempting to correct the k@xmath24 measurements for extinction had a negligible effect on the average ( 0.004 magnitudes ) and increased the scatter , so we have used the uncorrected k@xmath24 values . in an arbitrary normalization that brings the value of the flux density ratios close to 1 ( and will be preserved for a similar calculation for solar type stars ) the average ratio of k@xmath29 to 24@xmath3 m flux densities is 0.964 @xmath5 0.008 .",

    ", we reject the two lowest and two highest values .",
    "the average normalized ratio of @xmath25 to 24@xmath0 m flux density is 1.005 @xmath5 0.007 .",
    "the ratio of the two averages for a and solar - type stars , 1.042 , is then the color in flux units of a solar - type star relative to the a - star zero point .",
    "it is equivalent to a color in magnitudes of 0.045 @xmath5 0.011 in the sense that the solar - type stars are redder than a0v stars .",
    "as shown in table 3 and figure 2 , the resultant value for the sun at 24@xmath3 m is 5% above the engelke function , and we have assigned an error of 5% to this function at these wavelengths .",
    "hence , the agreement is within the errors .",
    "however , the color of the solar - type stars is well enough determined to suggest that the engelke function is 3 to 7% too blue relative to the true solar sed .",
    "we can test the v , j , h , and k - band calibration by checking to see if we get the correct colors for the sun . from the synthetic colors , we find v - k@xmath24 = 1.568 .",

    "we therefore quote a net error of 2% .",
    "similar errors should hold for the other bands .    in principle",

    "it is possible that there are residual errors at the 1 to 2% level .",
    "therefore , rather than assuming the 2mass color zero points , we determined the zero points for the j and h bands by averaging measurements of a large number of a0v stars also measured in the read 1 mode .",

    "since these colors are relative to the 2mass system , we corrected them for the slight deviations from zero color we found for a0 stars ( see appendix d ) .",

    "the errors are estimates from those quoted in the 2mass catalog , with some allowance for systematic effects .",

    "if we predict errors from the quoted uncertainties in the 2mass measurements , we obtain a predicted error for a typical j - k@xmath24 measurement of 3.1% , whereas the scatter in this color indicates a typical error of 2.3% . this behavior is consistent with some degree of correlation in the 2mass measurements , which is reasonable .",
    "there is no indication of scatter in the intrinsic colors of the stars .",
    "a similar argument indicates no detected intrinsic scatter in h - k@xmath29 .",
    "we have made a more demanding test for the uniformity of the jhk colors of solar - type stars .",
    "we used the accurate near infrared photometry of kidger & martn - luis ( 2003 ) , which for well - measured stars has errors of less than 1% .",
    "we did not use other available high accuracy photometry compilations that concentrate on faint sources to calibrate infrared arrays , since these stars are more distant and subject to reddening .",
    "we selected the 16 stars from kidger & martn - luis with listed spectral types of g0 through g5 iv or v , with @xmath35 , with six or more measurements , and with errors in all three bands indicated as @xmath31 1% .",

    "in addition , kidger & martn - luis ( 2003 ) include a number of color - color plots that show small scatter that is independent of spectral type from a through k stars .",
    "we conclude that g stars have intrinsic scatter in the near infrared colors of no more than about 1% .    the `` anomalously red '' color of the solar spectrum as measured by thuillier et al . ( 2003 ) relative to such determinations as holmberg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) has not been satisfactorily explained previously ( see discussion in casagrande et al .",
    "it is comforting that , with care in analyzing the photometric database , we have found that this color is consistent with those of other solar - type stars , and that the scatter in color among such stars is small . as shown in table 3 ,",
    "this color is consistent not only with the empirically measured solar colors but with the predictions of a large number of models of the solar sed .",

    "it agrees with the overall spectral shape of solar - type stars measured with irs between 8 and 30@xmath3 m .",
    "the model also includes a full treatment of the solar absorption line spectrum .",
    "we therefore adopt it to describe the mid - infrared sed of the sun . to normalize it to the thuillier et al .",
    "spectrum , we took advantage of the fact that the absolute level in the engelke function agrees very closely with the thuillier spectrum at 2.3 - 2.4@xmath0 m , so we can use this fit as a smoothing function to help join the two spectra .",
    "figure 1 illustrates how the hm74 model was joined to the thuillier measurements .",
    "the remaining issue is that the co fundamental bands are difficult to fit _ a priori _ in models .",
    "we empirically adjusted the depth of these features by setting the co absorption features to be consistent with the spectroscopy of wallace & livingston ( 2003 ) . at their high spectral resolution",
    ", there are a number of atmospheric mini - windows that allow accurate measurement of co equivalent widths . on average",
    ", we found that the hm74 model had slightly weaker co absorption than found by wallace & livingston .",
    "we therefore used the engelke approximation between 4 and 6.5@xmath3 m as a featureless continuum , normalized to the hm74 model .",
    "we multiplied the engelke sed by 0.125 , subtracted it from the hm74 model , and renormalized the result to the original continuum level to bring the co equivalent widths into agreement with those of wallace & livingston ( 2003 ) .",
    "this modified spectrum was used to replace the hm74 values between 4 and 6.5@xmath3 m .",
    "our final adopted solar spectrum is shown in figure 2 and given numerically in appendix a. the engelke ( 1992 ) fit to the val model / reconciled measurements falls slightly below the empirical model at wavelengths longer than about 6@xmath3 m . in the irac 8@xmath3 m band ,",
    "the discrepancy is 1.4% , at the outer limits of the errors .",
    "the model is therefore slightly discrepant with our calibration , based on accurate solar measurements . at 24@xmath3 m ,",
    "the model and the photometry differ from the solar measurements by 5% , but here the model result is to be preferred because of the larger errors in the solar measurements . in general , the model should represent the true solar sed to within @xmath2 2% , an error estimated from a combination of the discrepancies with the solar measurements and the photometric errors in the solar - type stellar colors .",
    "to extend these procedures to the visible range , we use the average of our `` best '' calibrations at 10.6@xmath3 m from table 1 and at 2.22@xmath0 m from table 2 and the `` vega '' model to predict a value of 3714 jy for vega at 0.5556@xmath0 m .",
    "mgessier ( 1995 ) has summarized and reconciled various direct measurements of vega , corrected to a wavelength of 0.5556@xmath0 m .",
    "the preferred value for the reconciled measurements is 3563 jy , 4.2% or 0.045 magnitudes less than we find at this same wavelength via the model .",
    "the net errors are only about 1% for the infrared and 0.7% at 0.5556@xmath0 m .",
    "this value agrees with the results of bohlin and gilliland ( 2004 ) , who find that the spectrum of vega normalized at 0.5556@xmath3 m and extrapolated using the 1993 kurucz model to 2@xmath3 m is 2% fainter than the calibration of cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which we find in turn is 2% lower than our calibration .",
    "thus , although the theoretical `` vega '' spectrum gives good agreement with measurements in the infrared , there is a significant discrepancy between the infrared and visible .",
    "this result is not new .",
    "mgessier ( 1995 ) discusses it at length , summarizing many results that point to the same issue . as a result",
    ", this work considers the infrared calibration separately from the visible one for similar reasons as discussed here .",
    "it seems likely that the departure from the model arises because vega is a pole - on rapid rotator . with a measurement of the surface temperature distribution on the star ( aufdenberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , we can now address where its sed might depart sufficiently from the single - temperature models to be of concern for its use as a calibrator .",
    "the equatorial surface temperature is estimated to be 7900k , corresponding to type a7 , which has v - k = 0.5 , j - k = 0.09 , and h - k = 0.03 ( tokunaga 2000 ) . if we imagine the effective visible surface of the star to be a combination of a0 and a7 spectral type to give a net v - k = 0.045 , by interpolation we expect an effect of @xmath1 0.01 magnitudes in j - k and 0.003 magnitudes in h - k to allow for the cooler portion of the surface ( these values have little dependence on the exact spectral types used to fit vega ) .",
    "we conclude that this effect can be ignored in using vega as a relative infrared calibrator at h band and longer wavelengths , but that measurable effects are expected at wavelengths short of j.    in appendix d , we determine a 2mass k magnitude for vega of -0.036 @xmath5 0.010 by transforming the measurements of johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 ) into the 2mass system .",
    "typical adopted values for the v magnitude of vega are 0.03 ( johnson et al . 1966 ; gray 1998 ) or 0.026 ( bohlin & gilliland 2004 ) .",
    "the observed v - k of this star is therefore 0.062 to 0.066 @xmath5 0.012 . by comparing the absolute calibrations at v and in the infrared",

    "the difference in these estimates is 0.003 to 0.007 @xmath5 0.018 , that is , it is not significantly different from zero .",
    "this desirable outcome would appear in part to result from the indirect procedures used to set the zero point for most photometry since that of johnson . by setting the v - k colors of a large suite of a0v stars to zero",
    ", the systems have been forced to remove any residual anomalies due to the behavior of vega .",
    "the result confirms our derivation of a - star and solar - type colors in this paper under the assumption that there are no unexpected offsets between the visible and near infrared , despite the unexpected behavior of vega as the star defining the zero points .",
    "we have demonstrated that an absolute calibration can be derived between 1 and 25@xmath0 m that is consistent with all the direct calibration measurements , and both with a - star standards and with the solar spectrum as reflected by solar - type stars .",

    "the homogeneity and generally high accuracy of these data support a new approach to calibration .",
    "initially large samples of stars are cleaned of members with anomalous colors ( due , e.g. , to reddening or photometric errors ) and the results of still moderately large samples are then averaged to drive the measurement errors to small values .",
    "in addition to providing an accurate calibration that does not depend on a small number of `` ideal '' objects such as vega was once thought to be , this approach facilitates extending the calibration over the entire sky .",

    "the dynamic range of the measurements used in the calibrations in sections 2 and 3 is small , only about a factor of five , and hence the demands on instrument linearity are modest .",
    "to test the linearity over a larger dynamic range , we use a - stars from su et al .",

    "( 1982 ) , and then independently confirmed the transformation in carpenter ( 2001 ) from the table of fainter standards .",
    "thus , the net transformation to 2mass read 1 observations is k@xmath40 - k@xmath42 = 0.048 , very close to the value of 0.044 derived independently by bessell et al .",

    "we exclude the two lowest measurements ( of hd 172728 ) .",
    "we also exclude the measurements of hd 47332 and hd 57336 , the two highest measurements , because they may have faint excess emission .",
    "since we have excluded the two highest and two lowest measurements , the bias on the results should be minimal .",
    "we have considered three types of nonlinearity .",
    "the first is the typical gradual reduction of response in a simple integrating amplifier as the wells fill .",
    "the second is an over - correction for a nonlinearity of the first kind , so it just reverses the sign of the curve .",
    "the third is having a small latent image under the image of the star being measured .",
    "since we have used custom flat fields to remove latents , the sign of the latent image could be either positive ( adding to the star signal ) or negative ( subtracting from it ) .",
    "examination of our data indicates that we can place an upper limit of about 50@xmath0jy on any residual latent image .",
    "as shown in figure b1 , the primary evidence for nonlinearity is a tendency for the bright stars to yield slightly larger signals than would be the case with a perfectly linear system .",
    "this offset is within the errors , but , if confirmed , it suggests that the correction for nonlinearity in large signals may be slightly too big ( see engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for further discussion ) .",
    "there is also evidence for a slight tendency to obtain larger net slopes with increasing integration time , an effect that would be consistent with the possible nonlinearity ( engelbracht et al .",
    "however , at the level of our measurements , 10 to 50mjy , these effects are negligible .",
    "this appendix discusses our measurement procedures for the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "it also collects the samples of stars used for the various calculations in the paper , along with their key parameters .",
    "one of us ( j. carpenter ) re - reduced the measurements of our solar - type stars to put them on the identical basis as the calibration reductions of reach et al .",
    "the 8@xmath3 m solar analog calibration is based on the stars listed in table c1 . fortunately , although some of the irac bands can have small offsets due to positioning of the measuring aperture , this effect is immeasurably small at 8@xmath0 m ( m. silverstone , private communication ) , and we have ignored it .",
    "we thus only had to divide by the bandpass correction to convert to equivalent monochromatic flux density at 7.872@xmath0 m .",
    "since the seds of solar - type stars match very closely in this spectral region those of a stars , we applied the correction quoted by reach et al . for an a1 star , 1.042 .      to achieve the most accurate possible data reduction at 24@xmath0 m , we have used a series of custom processing steps that have been developed by the mips team ( discussed in more detail by engelbracht et al .",
    "these steps are applied after standard pipeline processing .",
    "first , we remove the artifacts due to dust particles on the instrument pickoff mirror .",
    "special flat fields are constructed from all of the photometric data to identify the effects of these particles .",
    "second , we compensate for the latent images on the 24@xmath0 m array as a result of exposure to bright sources .",
    "these dark latents appear as regions of reduced sensitivity centered on the array positions of bright sources in subsequent exposures .",
    "an image of the latents with all sources removed is produced by median combining the entire data set with appropriate bright source masks .",
    "the dark latents are removed from each individual frame by dividing the frames by the normalized dark latent image prior to mosaicking .",
    "finally , mosaicked images are produced at the nominal pixel scale , 2.45 \" .",
    "this processing is described in more detail by engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "we used simple aperture photometry on the 24@xmath0 m images .",
    "the tabulated data assumed 1 dn / s = 1.05 mjy / square arcsec .",
    "the photometry was done within an aperture of radius 35 `` , and relative to sky measured in an annulus between radii of 40 and 50 '' . the aperture correction for this measurement approach",
    "was taken to be 1.084 .",
    "we used the standard world coordinate system pointing information as a first guess for centering , with fine tuning with the idl program `` mpfit2dpeak.pro '' written by craig markwardt . comparing photometry for separate measurements of the same star ( typically also in different observation campaigns )",
    "indicates that the end - to - end scatter ( including instrumental instability as well as photometry errors ) is less than 0.5% rms ( and not dependent on the brightness of the target for the range considered here  further discussion in engelbracht et al .",
    "2007 ) . achieving this level of repeatability",
    "requires not only the special post - pipeline processing , but also careful standardization of photometric procedures .",
    "therefore , all the results reported in this paper used the identical photometric procedures applied by the same person ( m. blaylock ) .",
    "the results are listed in tables c2 and c3 ; the maximum plausible errors in this band are no more than 1.5% rms .",
    "our procedures have been selected to be very conservative ( e.g. , large measurement aperture ) and adapted to high repeatability .",
    "other photometry approaches can be tested by using archival data for our program stars listed in tables c2 and c3 .",
    "tables c1 - c3 list the 2mass k@xmath24 value and a second k@xmath29 magnitude .",
    "@xmath27 is a combination of the 2mass j , h , and k@xmath24 measurements used to measure the scatter in k@xmath24 - [ 24 ] color among the stars .",
    "we used the standard colors for the spectral type of the star ( tokunaga 2000 ) to convert the j and h measurements to equivalent k@xmath24 ones .",
    "the typical distance to one of the a stars is about 100pc , so reddening may be significant .",
    "we estimated the reddening from the standard v - k color for the spectral type of the star ( tokunaga 2000 ) and the extinction curve of rieke and lebofsky ( 1985 ) , and corrected all the j , h , and k measurements accordingly ( the 24@xmath0 m extinction is less than 1% even for the most obscured of the stars ) .",
    "the @xmath27 magnitude is the weighted average of all three extinction- and color - corrected measurements . because the colors of a stars are close to zero already , minor differences in photometric system have little influence on this conversion .",
    "the small offsets in the 2mass j - k and h - k colors discussed in appendix d have a negligible effect on our calculations here , because they are nearly equal and opposite in sign .",
    "the nominal errors in the resulting @xmath27 magnitudes are 2% or less .",
    "similar procedures were used to compute @xmath43 for the solar - type stars in tables c1 and c3 , except that no extinction corrections were applied .",
    "although some of the minor offsets in 2mass have been mitigated by our using only read 1 observations , there is little information over the full read 1 dynamic range on how the photometry behaves at this level of accuracy .",
    "we therefore place an estimate of 3% on the net errors - half from the rms errors and half from possible systematic ones .",
    "to obtain a high signal - to - noise irs spectrum of a solar - type star , we started with the spectra of the a stars hr 1014 , 2194 , 5467 , and hd 163466 and of the solar - type stars hd 9826 , 10800 , 13974 , 39091 , 55575 , 84737 , 86728 , 95128 , 133002 , 136064 , 142373 , 188376 , 196378 , 212330 , and 217014 obtained from the spitzer archive .",
    "after standard processing with the s13 irs pipeline to the bcd level , nod pairs were subtracted to remove the background and the spectra were extracted with spice ( spitzer science center 2007 ) .",
    "we then ratioed the spectra for similar stellar types in various combinations to determine the subset that were most closely similar .",
    "we also gave weight to evidence from the signal strength that the star was accurately centered in the spectrograph slit .",
    "as a result , we rejected hr 1014 from further processing because of a number of broad peaks and valleys in the ratio .",
    "we rejected the short module data for hd 9826 , 95128 , 188376 because of pronounced downward slopes with increasing wavelength in the ratios , and also hd 13974 and hd 196378 because the s module ratio is low relative to the l module data , suggesting a pointing issue with s. we rejected the l module data for hd 13974 and 188376 because of slopes and curves in the ratios , as well as for hd 9826 , 95128 , and hd 142373 because low values of the ratio relative to that for the s module suggest pointing issues .",
    "we averaged the accepted spectra ( ten for each module ) with equal weight , and then divided the solar - type average spectrum with the a - star one and multiplied the result by the a - star kurucz model .",
    "the resulting spectrum had a discontinuity between the short and long irs modules , which we removed by forcing the average value between 12 and 14@xmath0 m to equal that between 15 and 17@xmath0 m .",
    "we finally smoothed the result with a 7-pixel boxcar ( giving a final spectral resolution of @xmath2 10% ) .",
    "most near infrared photometric systems claim to be relative to a zero point defined by vega , with this star or a model of it placed either at 0.02 ( to coincide with the johnson bright star measurements ) or at zero .",
    "we have investigated how the peculiarities of this star have affected these definitions .",
    "this question is not easily answered because few of the sets of photometry since johnson have actually measured vega directly .",
    "we have therefore evaluated the quality of the johnson photometry and then transformed it into the 2mass system , finally using the transformation to compute the magnitude of vega as it would have been measured by 2mass .",
    "johnson et al . ( 1966 ) report 173 measurements of vega within the overall set of photometry that constitutes their study of bright stars .",
    "we evaluated the quality of this photometry in two ways .",
    "first , we looked at the internal scatter for the individual measurements of vega .",
    "we rejected the four highest and lowest measurements at both j and k ( i.e. , 4.6% of the measurements ) and computed the straight average and standard deviation of the remaining 165 measurements .",
    "the results are j = 0.019 @xmath5 0.004 , k = 0.023 @xmath5 0.004 , and rms scatter of 0.048 and 0.050 in j and k respectively . with",
    "no outlier rejection the values for vega are unaffected , but the errors increase to 0.005 and the rms scatter values to 0.061 and 0.065 .",
    "however , we believe the values with the outlier rejection are the most representative .    we have tested this result in another way , by comparing stars measured in common by johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 ) and either bouchet et al . ( 1991 ) or kidger and martn - luis ( 2003 ) .",
    "we first transformed the johnson photometry into the other system ( as described below ) .",
    "we excluded stars used by johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 ) as standards ( stars such as vega that were measured many times ) in case their use in fitting for the photometric corrections would bias the comparison .",
    "there were 314 measurements suitable for the comparison with bouchet et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , of which we rejected the seven high and seven low outliers ( i.e. , 4.5% of the measurements ) .",
    "the rms of the deviations was then 0.054 at j and 0.048 at k , that is , in excellent agreement with the internal scatter of the johnson measurements of vega .",
    "similarly for the measurements of kidger and martn - luis ( 2003 ) , there were 135 suitable measurements .",
    "after transforming the johnson photometry and rejecting the two high and two low outliers ( 3% of the measurements ) , the rms scatter is 0.048 at both j and k. we conclude that the johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 ) photometry is valid at the level of 1-@xmath30 errors of 0.05 magnitudes for single measurements .",
    "since most of the published bright star photometry is based on three or more measurements per star , this result is consistent with a typical overall accuracy of 3% or better .    the accuracy of the johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 ) photometry implies that vega is tied into their overall photometric system to a 1-@xmath30 error of less than 0.005 magnitudes",
    ". we will now determine transformations to put this measurement into the 2mass read 1 system .",
    "the simplest approach is to transfer directly .",
    "however , there are relatively few stars that were measured to high accuracy with the original johnson photometer and that are faint enough not to saturate the 2mass detector arrays .",
    "we have based the transformation on stars measured in johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 , 1968 ) and in lee ( 1968 ) .",
    "the comparison is compromised by the decreased signal to noise of the stars and we have not attempted a color correction ( although the data imply it would be small ) . we derive that vega would have a 2mass j magnitude of -0.042 and a k magnitude of -0.057 . given the issues with signal to noise , we prefer the average of these values , -0.050 , as a best estimate of the near infrared vega magnitude .",
    "this result is limited by the poor overlap in the dynamic range of the two measurement sets ; to overcome this problem , we have calculated the 2mass vega magnitudes by transforming the johnson photometry to other systems that have a wider overlap with 2mass . for the first case , we used bright standards in the cit system defined by elias et al .",
    "we find a transformation in good agreement with those derived previously by elias et al .",

    "( 1966 ) not the final photometric results combining those measurements for each star .",
    "we use the transformation from the cit to 2mass systems available at the 2mass web site to obtain 2mass k@xmath29 magnitudes for vega of -0.028 , -0.023 , and -0.032 using respectively our transformation and those of besell & brett ( 1988 ) and of elias et al .",
    "similarly , we obtain a 2mass k@xmath29 magnitude of -0.033 if we make the transformation through the eso system photometry of bouchet et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and a k@xmath29 magnitude of -0.045 if the transformation is made through the main body of photometry of kidger & martn - luis ( 2003 ; their table 2 ) .",
    "there is a conflict in the latter case because kidger & martn - luis ( 2003 ) also measured vega directly , using a reduced system gain , and set it identically to zero magnitude at the near infrared bands ( their table 3 ) . to check this result ,",
    "we have computed the average k - l ( rejecting one high and one low value ) for the 19 late b stars and a stars using l from their table 3 ( in all cases measured with the reduced gain ) and k from either table 2 or 3 . we obtain + 0.058 @xmath5 0.016 where we would have expected zero .",
    "this result implies that the l magnitude of vega if measured relative to the high - gain k photometry would be -0.058 @xmath5 0.016 , in agreement with the negative k magnitude derived from their table 2 .",
    "although we have been unable to explain the discrepancy completely , the behavior of the other stars at l has led us to accept the value from the transformation of the data in table 2 .",
    "an additional comparison can be made from koornneef ( 1983 ) , who established a system based on the johnson j and k photometry . from the 2mass color transformations , the corresponding 2mass k magnitude for",
    "vega would be -0.023 .",
    "all of these estimates are consistent with assigning vega the average k magnitude of -0.036 @xmath5 0.006 in the 2mass system .",
    "the quoted error is based on the scatter of the measurements ; given the small number of them , an error of 0.010 is a more secure estimate .",
    "the 2mass data provide a very homogeneous set of near infrared photometry over the entire sky , with accuracies well within the original specifications for the survey . nonetheless , there are small offsets in those measurements that can be significant at the levels of accuracy desired for the calibration discussed in this paper .",
    "we discuss two such effects in this appendix .",
    "there are offsets of the order of 2% between read 1 and read 2 measurements , in the range where they overlap .",
    "it is not clear how to derive a universal correction for this effect .",
    "therefore , for the calibration we selected stars measured only in read 1 mode .      to define a zero point at v , j , h , and k",
    ", we built a sample of 57 a0v stars distributed over the entire sky , brighter than m@xmath44 = 7 mag .",
    ", and with `` a '' quality read 1 2mass measurements at all three near infrared colors .",
    "we took b and v magnitudes from the hipparcos main catalog ( perryman et al .",
    "stellar classifications were taken from simbad .",
    "the infrared colors are not a strong function of the spectral type - from b8 to a2 , j - k changes from -0.03 to + 0.03 ( tokunaga 2000 ) - so type errors are not a major concern . however , reddening is . to eliminate reddened stars ( and other sources of error ) , we excluded ones with b - v @xmath32 0.05 and ones with @xmath45v - k@xmath29@xmath45 @xmath32 0.05 .",
    "in addition , because the 2mass quoted errors can be large in h band , we excluded three stars with h - k @xmath32 0.07 , which is 5% redder than the value averaged over the sample . for the final sample of 57 stars",
    "( see table d1 ) , the result was an average @xmath31v - k@xmath32 consistent with zero , @xmath31j - k@xmath46 = -0.022 @xmath5 0.003 , and @xmath31h - k@xmath32 = 0.019 @xmath5 0.003 .",
    "the average values are not affected by various assumptions we tried with regard to final sample selection .",
    "for example , if we keep all stars with @xmath45v - k@xmath45 @xmath31 0.1 , we get a slight positive residual in @xmath31v - k@xmath32 , but values for @xmath31j - k@xmath32 and @xmath31h - k@xmath32 equal to the ones above within the errors .",
    "an independent test was conducted with a0 dwarfs from the michigan spectral atlas .",
    "there are a total of 6008 such stars with `` good '' 2mass measurements in all three bands .",
    "we discarded all of them with @xmath45v - k@xmath29@xmath45 @xmath32 0.05 , leading to a sample of 510 .",
    "eleven of this sample were discarded as photometric outliers .",
    "of the remaining stars , 220 have read 1 photometry in all three bands , and the net j - k@xmath29 = -0.016 @xmath5 0.018 for these stars .",
    "similarly , we found a net h - k@xmath29 = + 0.026 @xmath5 0.022 based on 212 stars from the michigan spectral atlas sample .",
    "the quoted errors are the population standard deviations .",
    "the nominal standard deviations of the means are only about 0.001 , but there are suggestions of other low level trends in the data that would make such an accurate color difficult to obtain .",
    "we conclude that the net colors are in agreement with the ones derived from the smaller and more heterogeneous sample discussed above .",
    "the result for the stars measured in read 2 mode are j - k@xmath29 = -0.005 @xmath5 0.021 ( population sigma , 150 stars ) showing that the offset is a function of the 2mass read mode .",
    "therefore , corrections to remove these small effects will be relatively complex to apply .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have also identified offsets of similar size , but not with the same values as those we have determined .",
    "their sample is predominantly k giants , and their vega zero point model is redder than ours . if we compute the offsets only for the nine a stars in their sample and correct for the different colors for vega , their results agree with ours to within 1.5 - 2% with errors of about 1.6% , i.e. , within the errors .",
    "these results could at least partially explain infrared color offsets such as those found by casagrande et al .",
    "( 2006 ; figures 2,3 , and 4 ) .",
    "future improvements in the comparisons with theoretical models will need to take account carefully of such small systematic effects in the photometry .      in the v , j ,",
    "h , and k bands , the colors of solar - type stars depart significantly from a rayleigh - jeans shape and we have to be careful in defining a sample of such stars . we determined average colors from the list of 36 solar - type stars in table d2 .",
    "the stellar parameters are from the appalachian state nstars web site ( gray 2007 ) , with a few extras from soubiran & triaud ( 2004 ) .",
    "a fit of temperature vs. spectral type from the full nstars database shows that the average g2v star is assigned a temperature of 5720k .",
    "the solar temperature of 5778k is within the scatter , but either the sun is relatively hot for its spectral class , or there is a systematic offset between its temperature and those assigned through the stellar models to other stars .",
    "we used the hipparcos photometry at v to eliminate stars from the sample with v - k@xmath24 colors differing by more than 0.1 magnitudes from expectations for their spectral types .",
    "these stars are systematically much closer than the a stars discussed above , so the color deviations are less likely to arise from reddening . in support of this conclusion , there are nearly as many blue as red deviations .",
    "we attribute the discordant values to errors in the spectral types .",
    "each v - k@xmath24 was corrected to the equivalent value for 5778k according to a relationship fitting the temperature of the star and the standard v - k colors from tokunaga ( 2000 ) .",
    "this relationship was set to zero at 5778k , so it acts only to take out the variations with temperature but not to cause an overall shift in color .",
    "we ignored reddening because the maximum distance of the sample members , 40pc , puts them within the local bubble of very low density interstellar medium ( e.g. , knude & hog 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "although we prefer to use the hipparcos v magnitudes because they are homogeneous over the entire sky , to do so we need to allow for possible systematic offsets relative to johnson v. these effects should be small for a stars because of their nearly zero colors . to evaluate them for solar - type stars",
    ", we used the sample of 102 stars listed in the nstars database as being of g - type and for which there was high quality v photometry , to find a net offset of @xmath31v@xmath47 - v@xmath48@xmath32 = -0.007 @xmath5 0.002 .",
    "we corrected the measured v - k@xmath24 color accordingly .",
    "we also found two stars in our solar - type sample , hd 139777 and hd 218739 , with large offsets between the nstars tabulated groundbased magnitudes and those from hipparcos ( 0.07 - 0.08 mag . ) .",
    "multiple groundbased measurements plus the v - k color showed that the groundbased results were correct , and we substituted them .",
    "otherwise , the standard deviation in the difference of hipparcos and groundbased v magnitude derived from uvby was only 1.6% , confirming the high quality of the hipparcos data ( and of the groundbased uvby data also ) .",
    "r(@xmath49 ) _ as the _ _ _ _ relative response function of the photometric band , the equivalent band width is            to idealize measurements made through a given photometric band to a monochromatic equivalent flux , we need to assign a specific wavelength to the measurement . the mean , or effective , wavelength is defined by the following equation :      examples are given in table 6 .",
    "the zero point ( zp ) is conventionally defined as the flux density of `` vega '' at @xmath54 , but the stellar absorption features pose complications . the zps in table 6 are determined by interpolating over the absorptions in the stellar spectrum and then averaging @xmath55 over a 1% bandpass .",
    "any measurement expressed in terms of the mean wavelength of the photometric band needs to be accompanied by a color correction term that converts the apparent flux density to the value at @xmath56 for the specific source spectral energy distribution that reproduces the observed signal strength ( e.g. , low & rieke 1974 ) . the color correction is normalized to the result for a source with _ _",
    "f__@xmath57_(@xmath49 ) _ = constant across the band .",
    "the absorption features in stellar spectra can make computation of a precise color correction problematical , but alternatively one can be based on a blackbody spectrum .",
    "we have taken this approach for the illustrative values in table 6 .",
    "they are given in the sense that a flat spectrum that gives the same signal as a blackbody of the specified temperature will be brighter at the mean wavelength by the tabulated factor .",
    "it is convenient in many cases to set the color correction to zero for hot stars , which can be accomplished by an offset in the set of color terms with an appropriate counter - adjustment in the nominal zero point flux density ( e.g. , low and rieke 1974 ; mips handbook ) .",
    "another way to circumvent the effects of stellar absorptions is to use the `` average zero point '' , @xmath58 , where the flux density is that of `` vega '' . where the stellar spectrum is smooth and follows a planck curve closely , the average flux in the band is reproduced reasonably well by the stellar flux density at the mean wavelength times the color correction .",
    "where the stellar spectrum deviates from planckian behavior ( e.g. , in the h band due to the many members of the brackett series ) , there may be significant deviations from this relation .",
    "in general cases , the use of a fiducial wavelength and zero point imposes limits in the achievable accuracy ; it may be required to carry out the relevant integrals of the relative response function convolved with the object spectra .",

    "color corrections under this definition are relative to those for a source with _ _",

    ". otherwise , the procedures and pitfalls are similar to those for the mean wavelength .    the definitions in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) have the advantages that they are simple in concept and that the wavelength associated with a band is independent of the source properties .",
    "yet another definition is the isophotal wavelength , defined by      this approach has the advantage of subsuming the correction terms into the wavelength specification , providing a more streamlined description of a measurement .",
    "however , it is potentially confusing to have different wavelengths associated with measurements of different sources in the identical photometric band , and relating measurements to the identical wavelength requires introduction of color corrections similar to those needed with the definitions in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ( tokunaga & vacca 2005 ) .",
    "the issue of stellar features is complex in the use of @xmath62 , where the basic definitions can be misleading ( e.g. , _ _",
    "f__@xmath63__(@xmath49__@xmath64 _ ) _ may depend on the resolution used to measure the spectrum of the source ) . to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "one must use a continuum model of the stellar spectrum or interpolate over its spectral features .",
    "golay ( 1974 ) suggests avoiding these difficulties by replacing the stellar spectrum with a suitable planck function . instead , for the 2mass bands we have interpolated over any lines close to the fiducial wavelength ( a procedure similar to that used by cohen et al .",
    "1992 , 2003 ) .",
    "we find that reliable interpolations can be based on _ _ @xmath49__@xmath65 _ _ f__@xmath9 .",
    "since the infrared is close to the rayleigh - jeans realm for vega , the resulting function varies slowly and smoothly with wavelength , making it appropriate to use linear interpolations across line - contaminated regions .",
    "the interpolated values were converted to flux by dividing by _ _",
    ". figures e1 - e3 show our interpolations on the model spectrum of `` vega '' .",
    "table e1 lists the beginning and end wavelengths for the interpolations .",
    "our calculated values of _ _ @xmath49__@xmath64 in table 6 agree closely with those of cohen et al .",

    "<S> we determine an absolute calibration for the mips 24@xmath0 m band and recommend adjustments to the published calibrations for 2mass , irac , and iras photometry to put them on the same scale . </S>",
    "<S> we show that consistent results are obtained by basing the calibration on either an average a0v star spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , or by using the absolutely calibrated sed of the sun in comparison with solar - type stellar photometry ( the solar analog method ) . after the rejection of a small number of stars with anomalous seds ( or bad measurements ) , upper limits of @xmath1 1.5% ( rms ) are placed on the intrinsic infrared sed variations in both a dwarf and solar - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> these types of stars are therefore suitable as general - purpose standard stars in the infrared . we provide absolutely calibrated seds for a standard zero magnitude a star and for the sun to allow extending this work to any other infrared photometric system . </S>",
    "<S> they allow the recommended calibration to be applied from 1 to 25@xmath0 m with an accuracy of @xmath2 2% , and with even higher accuracy at specific wavelengths such as 2.2 , 10.6 , and 24@xmath0 m , near which there are direct measurements . however , we confirm earlier indications that vega does not behave as a typical a0v star between the visible and the infrared , making it problematic as the defining star for photometric systems . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of measurements of the sun with those of solar - type stars also provides an accurate estimate of the solar sed from 1 through 30@xmath3 m , which we show agrees with theoretical models . </S>"
